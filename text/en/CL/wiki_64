<text>Leon Fleisher (July 23, 1928 – August 2, 2020) was an American classical pianist, conductor and pedagogue. He was one of the most renowned pianists and pedagogues in the world. Music correspondent Elijah Ho called him &quot;one of the most refined and transcendent musicians the United States has ever produced&quot;.

Born in San Francisco, Fleisher began playing piano at the age of four, and began studying with Artur Schnabel at age nine. He was particularly well known for his interpretations of the two piano concertos of Brahms and the five concertos of Beethoven, which he recorded with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. With Szell, he also recorded concertos by Mozart, Grieg, Schumann, Franck, and Rachmaninoff.

In 1964, he lost the use of his right hand due to a neurological condition eventually diagnosed as focal dystonia, forcing him to focus on the repertoire for the left hand, such as Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto for the Left Hand&quot; and many compositions written for him. In 2004, he played the world premiere of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Klaviermusik&quot;, a piano concerto for the left hand completed in 1923, with the Berlin Philharmonic. After being treated by neurologist Daniel B. Drachman, he regained some control of his right hand and played and recorded two-hand repertoire again.

He was also notable as a conductor, and especially as a teacher for over 60 years at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the Curtis Institute of Music and others. He was a Kennedy Center Honors awardee in 2007, among many distinctions.

== Early life and studies ==
Fleisher was born on July 23, 1928, in San Francisco, the son of poor Jewish immigrants Bertha and Isidor Fleisher. His father was from Odessa and his mother from Poland. His father&#x27;s business was hat-making, while his mother&#x27;s goal was to make her son a great concert pianist. Fleisher started studying the piano at age four, and made his public debut at eight. At age nine, he became one of the few child prodigies to be accepted for study with the renowned Austrian teacher Artur Schnabel, who taught him in a tradition that descended directly from Beethoven through Carl Czerny and Theodor Leschetizky. He also studied with Maria Curcio and Karl Ulrich Schnabel. Fleisher played at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Monteux at age 16, and Monteux called him &quot;the pianistic find of the century.&quot;

== Performer and recording artist ==
In the 1950s, Fleisher signed an exclusive recording contract with Columbia Masterworks. He was particularly well known for his interpretations of the piano concerti of Brahms and Beethoven, which he recorded with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. They also recorded Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 25, the Grieg and Schumann piano concertos, Franck&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;.

When he was 24, Fleisher became the first American to win a prestigious piano competition established by Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, which helped to catapult his career. In 1964, at the age of 36, Fleisher lost the use of his right hand, due to a neurological condition that was eventually diagnosed as focal dystonia. In 1967, Fleisher commenced performing and recording the left-handed repertoire while searching for a cure for his condition. His first choice was Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto for the Left Hand&quot;. In addition, he undertook conducting beginning in 1968, and became associate conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 1973, and music director of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra. In the 1990s, Fleisher was able to ameliorate his focal dystonia symptoms after experimental botox injections to the point where he could play with both hands again.

In 2004, Vanguard Classics released Fleisher&#x27;s first &quot;two-handed&quot; recording since the 1960s, titled &quot;Two Hands&quot;, to critical acclaim. &quot;Two Hands&quot; is also the title of a short documentary on Fleisher by Nathaniel Kahn, which was nominated for an Academy Award for best short subject on January 23, 2007. Fleisher received the 2007 Kennedy Center Honors. Kennedy Center Chairman Stephen A. Schwarzman described him as &quot;a consummate musician whose career is a moving testament to the life-affirming power of art.&quot;

Fleisher&#x27;s musical interests extended beyond the central German Classic-Romantic repertoire. The American composer William Bolcom composed his &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos, Left Hand&quot; for Fleisher and his close friend Gary Graffman, who has also suffered from debilitating problems with his right hand. It received its first performance in Baltimore in April 1996. The concerto is so constructed that it can be performed in one of three ways, with either piano part alone with reduced orchestra, or with both piano parts and the two reduced orchestras combined into a full orchestra. Composers who wrote music for him also included Lukas Foss, Leon Kirchner and Gunther Schuller.

In 2004, Fleisher played the world premiere of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Klaviermusik&quot; (Piano Concerto for the Left Hand), Op. 29, with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Simon Rattle. This work was written in 1923, for Paul Wittgenstein, who disliked and refused to play it. However, he had sole performing rights and kept the score, not allowing any other pianists to play it. The manuscript was discovered among his papers after the death of his widow in 2002. On October 2, 2005, Fleisher played the American premiere of the work, with the San Francisco Symphony under Herbert Blomstedt. In 2012, at the invitation of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Fleisher performed at the Supreme Court of the United States.

He continued to be involved in music, both conducting and teaching for more than 60 years at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University, the Curtis Institute of Music, and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto; he was also closely associated with the Tanglewood Music Center. With Dina Koston, he co-founded and co-directed the Theater Chamber Players in 1968–2003, which was the first resident chamber ensemble of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Pedagogy. His students include Frank Lévy, André Watts, Yefim Bronfman, Hélène Grimaud, Louis Lortie, Dina Koston, Jonathan Biss, Lori Sims Nicholas Angelich, Joel Fan, and Galen Deibler.

His memoir, &quot;My Nine Lives&quot;, co-written with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s music critic Anne Midgette, was published in November 2010.

<text>A mechanic&#x27;s lien is a security interest in the title to property for the benefit of those who have supplied labor or materials that improve the property. The lien exists for both real property and personal property. In the realm of real property, it is called by various names, including, generically, construction lien. The term &quot;lien&quot; comes from a French root, with a meaning similar to , which is itself ultimately descended from the Latin &quot;ligamen&quot;, meaning &quot;bond&quot; and &quot;ligare&quot;, meaning &quot;to bind&quot;. Mechanic&#x27;s liens on property in the United States date from the 18th century.

==History and reasons for existence==

Mechanic&#x27;s liens in their modern form were first conceived by Thomas Jefferson, to encourage construction in the new capital city of Washington. They were established by the Maryland General Assembly, of which the city of Washington was then a part. However, it is not likely that Jefferson single-handedly dreamed up the idea.

At the time Jefferson promoted the law, a lien-like privilege already existed in civil law countries like France, the Dutch Republic and Spain, with some laws even tracing their roots to the Roman Empire. And since control of Louisiana had passed between the French and Spaniards, and had largely adopted the French Napoleonic Code, there was a similar privilege concept in that territory.

It seems highly likely that the legislators working on the first U.S. Mechanic Lien laws had knowledge of, and referenced these civil law concepts. Nevertheless, the United States version was original, as it gave builders a more robust right into the land itself (versus just the improvement&#x27;s value).

With respect to real property, mechanic&#x27;s liens are purely statutory devices that exist in every state (although in California, as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to the economics of the construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely the right to sue on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics&#x27; lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.

Without the mechanic&#x27;s lien, the contractor would have a limited number of options to enforce payment of the amounts owed. Further, there is usually a long list of claimants on any failed project. To avoid the specter of various trades, materialmen and suppliers attempting to remove the improvements they have made, and to maintain a degree of equality between the various lienors on a project, the statutory lien scheme was created. Without it, Tradesperson A may try to &quot;race&quot; Supplier B to the courthouse, the project site or the construction lender to obtain payment. Most lien statutes instead mandate strict compliance with the formalized process they create in return for the timely resolution and balancing of claims between all parties involved - both owners and lien claimants.

In the state of California, mechanic&#x27;s liens are a &quot;constitutional&quot; right guaranteed to contractors by the California Constitution. This right has been implemented in detail by statutes enacted by the California State Legislature. In Texas, the Texas Constitution gives builders the right to lien and sub contractors are given the right under Chapter 53 of the Texas State Property Code

==Vehicular definition of a lien sale==
A lien against a vehicle that is asserted by an auto mechanic is technically an &quot;artisan&#x27;s lien&quot; rather than a &quot;mechanic&#x27;s lien&quot;, but it operates in a similar fashion to a mechanic&#x27;s lien. A mechanic&#x27;s lien can only arise against real property i.e., land or buildings.
If a person (licensed repair facility) has repaired, furnished supplies or materials, towed or stored a vehicle and has not been paid for the services rendered, that person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the registered owner is presented with a written statement of charges for completed work or services. Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic has no right to keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a storage fee from the mechanic, as the mechanic is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle. In doing so the mechanic would commit the crime of conversion, or embezzlement.

On the other hand, the mechanic can assess certain expenditures from the owner that are related to the work performed. These expenditures are normally towing, storage fees, and the cost of filing the lien.

If the vehicle is towed by a public agency or private towing company, the lien arises when the vehicle is towed or transported. The lien may be satisfied by selling the vehicle through the lien sale process.

To conduct a lien sale, the person/lienholder must have possession of the vehicle and may require lien sale authorization from the State&#x27;s Department of Motor Vehicles, depending on the State and or value of the vehicle. Interested parties, including the registered and legal owners of record will be notified, by Registered Mail, before the sale occurs.

==Creation==

Mechanic&#x27;s liens exist to secure payment for services, labor and material on both personal and real property. However, the creation and enforcement mechanisms differ depending on whether real or personal property is involved. The law of mechanic&#x27;s liens on real property governs the creation and enforcement of these liens on items of personal property that have been attached to real property in such a way as to be a fixture.

==Creation and enforcement – personal property==

The English common law recognized mechanic&#x27;s liens respecting only personal property. The lien was created by operation of law by the fact of the artisan working on the personal property item or attaching additional material to it. However, to maintain the lien, the artisan had to retain possession of the article until he or she was paid. If the property were returned to the owner before that time, the lien was lost. The lien was enforced by a &quot;self-help&quot; sale of the property and applying the sale proceeds to payment of the amount owed for the workmanship. The sales were non-judicial, i.e., they were held in the same way as a sale of property pawned for a debt.

In America, 34 states now appear to have statutes providing for mechanic&#x27;s liens on personal property. These statutes tend to modify the common law rules. For example, in Virginia, a mechanic&#x27;s lien can only be enforced up to the amount of $625, and if the property is valued at over $5,000, it must be sold at a sheriff&#x27;s auction ordered by the court of appropriate jurisdiction.

==Creation, perfection, priority and enforcement – real property==

Mechanic&#x27;s liens on the title to real property are exclusively the result of legislation. Each state has its own laws regarding the creation and enforcement of these liens, but, overall, there are some similar elements among them. Many States distinguish between the types of real property upon which a mechanics lien can be filed.

Under the principle of sovereign immunity, real property of the government (public property) is ordinarily not subject to the claims of private parties. Therefore, unless the state specifically so provides, mechanic&#x27;s liens do not attach to the title owned by the state or its administrative subdivisions, such as cities. Similarly, mechanic&#x27;s liens under state law are invalid on federal construction projects. To protect subcontractors and suppliers working on federal projects where the contract price exceeds $100,000.00 the Miller Act requires general contractors to provide a payment bond which guarantees payment for work done in accordance with the terms of the contract. Many state and municipal governments similarly require contractors on public works projects to be bonded under so-called &quot;Little Miller Acts.&quot; Theoretically, the payment bond under the Miller Act or Little Miller Act stands in place of the government&#x27;s property, and qualified claimants make claims against that bond similar to how they would file an ordinary mechanic&#x27;s lien.

In many states, the legislature has created extra procedures in order for a mechanics lien to be placed on residential property. In New Jersey, which enacted the strictest of these regulations, a mechanics lien can only be placed on residential property after a Notice of Unpaid Balance and Right to File Lien has been filed within 60 days of the lienor&#x27;s last date of work and an arbitration award has been issued by an American Arbitration Association arbitrator permitting a mechanics lien to be filed.

The act itself of filing a mechanics lien can be difficult. Most States simply require the filing of the mechanics lien with a county or court clerk within a defined amount of time from a triggering event. However, Maryland requires an application to the Court in order to file a mechanics liens. In Maryland, corporations must hire an attorney to make an application to the court.

===Creation and perfection===

Under the statutes, the lien is usually created by the performance of labor or the supplying of material that improves the property. Just what type of contribution counts as a valid basis for a mechanics lien varies, depending on the particular state statute that applies. Some common examples are:
* laborers, carpenters, electricians, mechanical/HVAC contractors and plumbers working on the project site;
* lumber yards, plumbing supply houses and electrical suppliers;
* architects and civil engineers who drew up the construction plans and specifications; and
* offsite fabricators of specialty items that are ultimately incorporated into the project.

Often, there is no simple dividing line that is useful in every state, or even in every case, for determining this eligibility. Deciding whether a party has a legitimate lien right may depend on examining court cases that have either upheld or rejected lien claims in the same state.

Unlike other security interests, in most states, mechanic&#x27;s liens are given to contractors and material suppliers who may or may not have a direct contractual agreement with the owner of the land. In fact, this is often the norm because in most cases, the owner of the land contracts only with a general contractor (often called a &quot;prime contractor&quot;). The general contractor, in turn, hires subcontractors (&quot;subs&quot;) and material suppliers (&quot;suppliers&quot;) to perform the work. These subs and suppliers are entitled to liens on the owner&#x27;s property to secure their payment from the general contractor.

However, to have an enforceable lien, it usually must be &quot;perfected.&quot; This means that the holder of the lien must comply with the statutory requirements for maintaining and enforcing the lien. These requirements, which contain time limits, are generally as follows:
*Providing the required preliminary notice to the property owner disclosing the entitlement to the lien (some states). Formally this involves serving a Notice of Intent to Lien
*Filing notices of commencement of work (some states).
*Filing notices in the required public records offices of the intention to file a lien if unpaid (some states).
*Filing the notice or claim of lien in the required public records offices within a specified period of time after the materials have been supplied or the work completed (all states). The law varies from state-to-state on both the triggering event and the timing of this. Some states require the filing within a period measured from the time when the claimant completes its work, while others specify the event as being after all work on the project has been completed. The filing time periods after the triggering event vary.

Because of the difficulty often associated with the filing of mechanics liens and compliance with mechanics lien laws, many lienors use attorneys or mechanics lien filing services to ensure that their mechanics lien is filed correctly.

===Priority respecting other interests===

The statutes creating mechanic&#x27;s liens usually give them a higher priority with respect to other interests in the title than the law gives most real property security interests. Among other things, priority is the attribute that determines which of several competing security claims will have the first claim to the funds of a foreclosure sale. In this context, the priority of a mechanic&#x27;s lien is determined either by the time the lien attaches to the title to the property or by the point in time to which it &quot;relates back.&quot; With some exceptions, the lien attaches or relates back to a time prior to the time that any notice of it appears in the public records. In many states, this is specified as the time when the first visible construction commences on the building site. In others, it is when the contract is executed for the work to be done. In still others, each contractor or supplier&#x27;s lien attaches at the time when it commences its own work. Therefore, persons dealing with the owner of the title to the property risk having their interests unexpectedly subject to mechanic&#x27;s liens of which they had no knowledge.

Special provisions are made in some states for determining the priority between a mechanic&#x27;s lien and the lien of a mortgage that is financing the construction on the land. For instance, in the State of New York, the appearance of specified language in the mortgage to the effect that it is a construction loan preserves its priority over mechanic&#x27;s liens arising out of the construction, as long as subsequently filed lien claims that are legitimate are not ignored. In other states, such as Florida, it is an all or nothing proposition. There, the recording of the construction mortgage before the filing of a statutory notice of commencement of construction provides the mortgage with absolute priority over mechanic&#x27;s liens arising out of the construction. Still other states, such as California, provide priority for a construction loan mortgage recorded before the visible commencement of construction where the lender is obligated to disburse the funds. In the State of Illinois, there is a statutory funds disbursing scheme that, if followed, provides construction loan mortgage priority. In other states, there are still other arrangements and some states, such as Colorado, provide almost no practical means for a construction loan mortgage to obtain priority at all.

===Enforcement===

Mechanic&#x27;s liens are enforced exclusively through judicial foreclosure sales, i.e., through court proceedings similar to mortgage foreclosures. The court must determine whether the requirements of the statute have been met and, if so, the priority of the mechanic&#x27;s lien being foreclosed relative to the other liens or encumbrances on the title. Once that is determined, the court will order the property sold and the proceeds of the sale applied to the liens in the order of their priority.

===Limitations===
States may have various limitations on mechanic&#x27;s liens. In California Law a contractor must wait to take advantage of the lien rights until any of the following conditions occur; otherwise the lien will be considered premature:
:a) The work is completed according to the contracted scope of work, 
:b) the project has stopped (cessation), or 
:c) the person is prevented from finishing the work (terminated).
Each of these required events occur at the end of the project life-cycle (or at the end of the scope of work for the subcontractor, the project may be far from completed). The end of the project may not be remotely close to the actual time when the work was performed (and the time at which labor and materials were paid out of pocket for the work by the contractor).

Also, the work must go directly toward the work of improvement of the property. This may seem obvious, but there are numerous construction costs that are not subject to mechanics&#x27; liens. A portion of construction costs may not qualify for a mechanic&#x27;s lien because the work did not improve the property. A good example are items that are not intended to be permanent, but nevertheless, necessary in the course of construction. A temporary construction fence may be required, may serve a valuable function in safety and security, but is never expected to become part of the realty, so therefore is not a cost that is permitted under a mechanic&#x27;s lien.

The attractive nature of the mechanic&#x27;s lien is that the lien is secured by real property and the property can be sold in order to pay the lien. This is powerful tool, but not always efficient. In reality, this is a drawn out process that is not very efficient. However, given the economic conditions, and that lenders&#x27; usually have priority, the sale of the property may not be sufficient to pay for the value of the lien.

What is often overlooked is that the contractor is now financing the project when they perform work and do not receive prompt payment for that work. The contractor is now tying up valuable capital that could be used elsewhere while waiting for the end of a project. In addition, the contractor must bear the cost of litigation in order to enforce their mechanic&#x27;s lien rights. For disputes of a minor value, a mechanic&#x27;s lien is not going to be a cost-effective method of obtaining payment for services.

===Releases of Lien===
A &quot;lien release&quot;, also known as a &quot;release of lien&quot; or a &quot;cancellation of lien&quot;, is a document that may be voluntarily provided by a lien claimant, such as a subcontractor, in exchange for payment or a promise of payment from a general contractor or a property owner. Negotiations may be tricky, as lien claimants generally want to be paid before they release a lien, while the owner of the property subject to the lien will generally want the lien released before they make payment. Unlike a lien waiver that negates the right to file a lien in the future, a lien release cancels a lien that has already in effect.

Prior to making any payment, the property owner should request a release of lien from every supplier, contractor and subcontractor, which covers the materials used and the work performed on the project. A release of lien is a written statement that releases the property from the threat of lien. If the contract requires partial payments be made before the work is completed in full, then the property owner may request a partial release of lien covering all labor and materials used up to the time of payment.

Before final payment, a property owner should obtain an affidavit from the contractor that lists all unpaid parties who performed labor or services, or provided materials to the property. The property owner should make sure the contractor obtains releases from all of these parties before making final payment.

==Protection from liens==

Often a mechanic&#x27;s lien is discovered long after it has been filed in the public records, but by taking a few proactive measures, property owners can ensure their properties are protected from the burdens imposed by such mechanic&#x27;s liens.

===Notice of commencement===
File a Notice of Commencement before beginning any home construction or remodeling project. Record the form with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the county where the property being improved is located. Post a certified copy at the job site, too. The Notice notes the property owner&#x27;s intent to begin improvements, the location of the property, description of the work and the amount of bond (if any). It also identifies the property owner, contractor, surety, lender and other pertinent information.

A property owner who fails to record a Notice of Commencement or incorrect information on the Notice could result in having to pay twice for the same work or materials. Request a list of all subcontractors and suppliers who have a contract with the contractor to provide services or materials to the property.

At the end of the project and after the contractor is paid in full and obtained all of the necessary Releases of Lien and affidavits as described above are obtained, file a Notice of Termination of Notice of Commencement with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the county where the property being improved is located.

===Challenging a lien===
States typically have a process by which the land owner may challenge the claimant&#x27;s &quot;prima facie&quot; entitlement to the liens on grounds such as proper identification of the property, compliance with notice requirements, and timing. If the lien claim survives those challenges, the owner may &quot;bond off&quot; the lien by filing a surety bond with the court in which the lien action has been initiated. This, in effect, frees the property from the lien and allows for sale of the property. The ability to bond off the lien is especially crucial where developers desire to proceed with the sale of newly built homes, which would otherwise remain unsold and unoccupied during the lien litigation process.

==Outside the United States==

Countries that recognize mechanic&#x27;s liens often provide for very different rights and procedures than those of the United States.

Some provinces of Canada (including Quebec) and New Zealand recognize a process somewhat analogous to a mechanic&#x27;s lien. The Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador allows for liens similar to those of the United States.

With the exception of Mexico, mechanic&#x27;s liens are generally not recognized throughout Latin America. 
Some countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, specifically prohibit the lien, except where voluntarily undertaken.

<doc id="1177108" wikidata="Q4701009" url="?curid=1177108" title="Akili Smith">
<text>Kabisa Akili Maradufu Smith (born August 21, 1975) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round (third overall) of the 1999 NFL draft, the third quarterback in the first three choices, behind Tim Couch (Cleveland Browns) and Donovan McNabb (Philadelphia Eagles). He played college football for the Oregon Ducks. 

Smith was also a member of the Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Frankfurt Galaxy, and Calgary Stampeders.

==Early life and college==
Given the name Kabisa Akili Maradufu Smith (in Swahili, &quot;kabisa&quot; means &quot;completely&quot;, &quot;akili&quot; means &quot;mind&quot;, and &quot;maradufu&quot; means &quot;double&quot; or &quot;a Gemini twin&quot;) by his parents Glorida Bryant and Ray Smith, Akili Smith was born in San Diego, California. Smith attended Abraham Lincoln High School in San Diego, the alma mater of Marcus Allen and Terrell Davis.

Smith was named a Parade Magazine All-American and signed a letter of intent to play at San Diego State, but low test scores meant he had to attend Grossmont College, a junior college in the San Diego area for two years, prior to transferring to the University of Oregon.

Smith came to the foreground of draft discussions because of his performance in his senior season at Oregon, throwing 32 touchdown passes in 11 starts. He led the conference in passing yards and the entire NCAA in passing yards per attempt. Smith was named second-team All-American and Pac-10 conference offensive player of the year.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Cincinnati Bengals===
In the 1999 NFL draft, a year in which five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round, Smith was the third quarterback and third player selected overall, by the Cincinnati Bengals. Smith scored a 16 out of 50 on the NFL-administered Wonderlic test when he first took the exam in 1998. His agent Leigh Steinberg hired a tutor to help improve his score for the 1999 scouting combine, and he scored a 37 on the second try.

Prior to the draft, there was an effort by New Orleans Saints&#x27; head coach Mike Ditka and management to get the Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; high draft position so the Saints could get Ricky Williams. The final offer, which was refused by Bengals management, was for nine draft picks, several extra in that year as well as many the next year. Instead of taking the trade, the Bengals stayed with their initial decision to draft Smith, who, while athletic (he had also played two years of minor-league baseball and ran a 4.66 40-yard dash), was still largely unproven, having only succeeded at the college level for one season.

Smith missed a large portion of training camp during his rookie season in 1999 due to contract disputes. On August 24, 1999, he signed a seven-year contract worth up to $56 million with a $10.8 million signing bonus.

Despite showing athleticism in his early games, he failed to grasp the Bengals playbook fully and never established himself with the team. His offensive coordinator from 2001 to 2002, Bob Bratkowski, said Smith &quot;wasn&#x27;t as diligent as he should have been&quot; regarding his film and playbook study habits. During the four years he was with the Bengals, he started in only 17 games and threw just five touchdown passes and 13 interceptions, eventually leading to his release on May 31, 2003, after riding the bench mostly during the previous two years.

===Later career===
In 2003, Smith tried out for the Green Bay Packers, as Brett Favre&#x27;s backup. He was, however, unsuccessful there and was later released. In 2005, he was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after a stint in NFL Europe where he started four games for the Frankfurt Galaxy.

On April 28, 2007, Smith signed a two-year contract with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, where he was expected to compete for the starting quarterback position with another former NFL player, Henry Burris. After an unimpressive debut in an exhibition game against the Edmonton Eskimos, Smith played well in the final exhibition against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Though listed going into the game as the third-string quarterback, he completed three touchdown passes in only one half of play, including one to former Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Marc Boerigter.

==NFL career statistics==
==Post-football career==
After retiring from football, Smith was the quarterbacks coach for Grossmont College. Smith was a deacon at a Missionary Baptist church and played football for &quot;God&#x27;s House&quot;, a flag football team.

In March 2010, Smith joined the University of California&#x27;s football staff as a graduate assistant to work with the offense. Cal head coach Jeff Tedford previously coached Smith at Oregon when he was offensive coordinator.

In 2012, Smith took over as quarterbacks coach for St. Augustine High School in San Diego. Smith planned to finish the college degree that he started at the University of Oregon. As of September 2014, Smith was coaching football for The Bishop&#x27;s School in La Jolla, California, and was still 16 credits away from graduating from Oregon.

In June 2020, Smith was hired onto the coaching staff at Maranatha High School in Pasadena, California.

==Personal life==
Smith&#x27;s son, Akili Smith Jr., is a top quarterback recruit in the 2025 recruiting class and is committed to play at Oregon.

<doc id="1177141" wikidata="Q2544610" url="?curid=1177141" title="Speightstown">
<text>Speightstown (), also known as &quot;Little Bristol&quot;, is the second largest town in Barbados. It is situated north of the capital city of Bridgetown, in the northern parish of Saint Peter.

The area is named after William Speight, a member of Barbados&#x27; first Assembly during the Settlement years, and the former owner of the land where the town is located.

==History==
Speightstown was formally settled around 1630 and in the earliest days of settlement was Barbados&#x27;s busiest port (AMS Seaport Code: 27213, -- UN/LOCODE: BB SPT ). Ships laden with sugar and other commodities left Speightstown bound directly for London and especially Bristol. For this reason Speightstown is sometimes known as Little Bristol. The &quot;quaint town&quot; has now become the centre of a tourist area as well as a northerly shopping district.

The town itself is currently the subject of an archaeological research project, the Speightstown Community Archaeology Project (SCAP), which was established in 2010 and involves a collaboration between archaeologists and students of the University of Winchester, the University of the West Indies (Cave Hill) and Barbados Museums. To date work has focused upon an historic buildings categorisation of the town, graveyard memorial survey and excavations at the eighteenth-century coastal fort at Maycock&#x27;s Bay to the north.

==Geography==
=== Boundary ===
Through Statutory Instrument (S.I) 1984 No. 141, Road Traffic Act, CAP. 295, ROAD TRAFFIC REGULATIONS, and under Schedule Section # 6: The Boundaries of Bridgetown, Speightstown, Holetown and Oistin are cited as follows: 2) &quot;Speightstown: (a) the section of Highway 1 from the entrance of the Alexandra School to Scantleburys Drive; (b) the section of Church Street from its junction with Highway 1 to its junction with Round the Town Road; (c) the section of Chapel Street from its junction with Highway 1 to its junction with Round the Town Road; (d) the whole section of Gooding Alley.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Speightstown has been twinned with:

* - Reading, Berkshire, England (since 2003)
* - Charleston, South Carolina (since November 1997), the original parts of which were based on the plans of Barbados&#x27;s then capital city. Many dispossessed indigo, tobacco and cotton planters departed from Speightstown along with their slaves and helped found Charleston after there was a wholesale move to adopt sugar cane cultivation in Barbados; a land and labour-intensive enterprise which helped usher in the era of Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in the British West Indies.

==Notable residents==
*Actress Claudette Colbert spent six months annually in Speightstown after her retirement where she died and was laid to rest.
*Athlete and actor Oliver Skeete was born in Speightstown.

<doc id="1177149" wikidata="Q7994895" url="?curid=1177149" title="White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships">
<text>The White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partners&#x27;&quot;,&quot;formerly known as the OFBCI was an office within the White House Office that was part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

==Under George W. Bush==
OFBCI was established by President George W. Bush through an executive order on January 29, 2001, representing one of the key domestic policies of Bush&#x27;s campaign promise of &quot;compassionate conservatism.&quot; The initiative sought to strengthen faith-based and community organizations and expand their capacity to provide federally funded social services, positing that these groups were well-situated to meet the needs of local individuals. As Texas governor, Bush had used the &quot;Charitable Choice&quot; provisions of the 1996 welfare reform (which allowed &quot;faith-based&quot; entities to compete for government contracts to deliver social services) to support the work of faith-based groups in Texas. Established religions offer a critical financial contribution to the overall effort and effect of social services (e.g., community services with health care financing) in the US.

The office was briefly led by Don Willett, an aide from Bush&#x27;s tenure as governor of Texas who was later appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. The first person named as director of the OFBCI was John DiIulio, a University of Pennsylvania political science professor. DiIulio later left the office and became a critic of the Bush administration.

Critics of the OFBCI, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union, assert that it violated the Establishment Clause by using tax money to fund religion. They also argued that faith-based initiatives were used as part of electoral strategies to yield more votes for Bush and the GOP.

For fiscal year 2005, more than $2.2 billion in competitive social service grants were awarded to faith-based organizations. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2005, the total dollar amount of all grants awarded to FBOs increased by 21 percent (GAO 2006:43). The majority of these grants were distributed through state agencies to local organizations in the form of formula grants (GAO 2006:17).

===Establishment clause issues===
Faith-based organizations are eligible to participate in federally administered social service programs to the same degree as any other group, although certain restrictions on FBOs that accept government funding have been created by the White House to avoid violations of the Establishment Clause.
*They may not use direct government funds to support inherently religious activities such as prayer, worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.
*Any inherently religious activities that the organizations may offer must be offered separately in time or location from services that receive federal assistance.
*FBOs cannot discriminate on the basis of religion when providing services (GAO 2006:13).

==Under Barack Obama==

President Barack Obama renamed the office and appointed Joshua DuBois as its head. He also established an advisory council, composed of religious and secular leaders and scholars from different backgrounds. Each member of the council was appointed to a one-year term. 

According to ABC News, the office would seek &quot;to expand the role of this office as it relates to policy issues where religious and local leaders can be effective. DuBois would coordinate with faith-based and community organizations on social service outreach and work to utilize these organizations&#x27; efforts to advance the administration&#x27;s policies, with a primary focus on poverty.&quot; Joshua DuBois resigned as director in February 2013 and was succeeded by Melissa Rogers in March.

==Under Donald Trump==
Following the election of President Donald Trump, the office remained without a director; the website was no longer available. In May 2018, Trump started the Faith and Opportunity Initiative, a new White House office to help faith-based organizations get equal access to government funding.

==Under Joe Biden==
On February 14, 2021, President Joe Biden reestablished the Office with Melissa Rogers again serving as executive director.

==Under Donald Trump&#x27;s Second Presidency==
On January 20, 2025, following the second inauguration of Donald Trump, the office was disbanded through an Executive Order entitled &quot;Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions.&quot; In February 2025, Trump ordered the creation of the White House Faith Office, a new White House office to assist faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship in their efforts to strengthen American families, promote work and self-sufficiency, and protect religious liberty.

==Controversies==
*The separation of church and state was noted as one of major issues with the Faith-Based Initiatives laws. Critics have claimed that millions in government grants have gone to ministries operated by political supporters of the Bush administration, or have been given to minority pastors who recently committed their support.
*In June 2006, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Pratt ruled that a faith based-program called InnerChange at a Newton, Iowa prison, operated by Charles Colson&#x27;s Prison Fellowship Ministries, unconstitutionally used tax money for a religious program that gave special privileges to inmates who accepted its evangelical Christian teachings and terms. &quot;For all practical purposes,&quot; Judge Pratt said, &quot;the state has literally established an Evangelical Christian congregation within the walls of one of its penal institutions, giving the leaders of that congregation, i.e., InnerChange employees, authority to control the spiritual, emotional, and physical lives of hundreds of Iowa inmates.&quot; [See &quot;Americans United v. Prison Fellowship Ministries&quot;, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36970, June 2, 2006]
*On June 25, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in &quot;Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation&quot; that executive orders may not be challenged on Establishment Clause grounds by individuals whose sole claim to legal standing is that they are taxpayers. Both of President Bush&#x27;s court appointees, John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito, sided with the majority.
*The second head of the department, Jim Towey, in a session of &quot;Ask the Whitehouse&quot; dated November 26, 2003, stated in regard to a question about pagan faith-based organizations:

I haven&#x27;t run into a pagan faith-based group yet, much less a pagan group that cares for the poor! Once you make it clear to any applicant that public money must go to public purposes and can&#x27;t be used to promote ideology, the fringe groups lose interest. Helping the poor is tough work and only those with loving hearts seem drawn to it. 

:Pagans reacted angrily to the label &quot;fringe group&quot;, the suggestion that pagans are uncompassionate, the idea that they would apply for funding only to promote ideology, and the exclusion of pagan organizations implicit in the statement.
*Catholic League President William A. Donohue protested against the nomination of Harry Knox, a former director of Human Rights Campaign and gay rights activist, arguing that he has been dishonest and intolerant. Knox has condemned the positions of Catholic clergy on the issues of contraception and ordination of homosexuals.

<text>Velimir Zajec (born 12 February 1956) is a Croatian professional football manager and former player who is the current 
president of Dinamo Zagreb.

==Club career==
Zajec began his career at Dinamo Zagreb in 1974, aged 18. In ten years at the club, he helped them to two domestic cup wins, as well as the league title, their first title honour in 24 years. In 1979 and 1984, he was named the Yugoslav Footballer of the Year.

He then transferred to Greek club Panathinaikos, where he played over 100 games.

==International career==
Zajec made his debut for Yugoslavia in a March 1977 friendly match against the Soviet Union and earned a total of 36 caps, scoring 1 goal. He captained them at both the 1982 World Cup and the 1984 European Championship. His final international was an October 1985 friendly away against Austria.

==Coaching career==
Following retirement, he spent two years (1989–1991) as Director of Football at former club Dinamo Zagreb before returning to Panathinaikos to run their academy. Before long, he was promoted to head coach of the club. After a period he again, he returned to Zagreb, this time as head coach, before moving once more back to Panathinaikos in 2002 to become Director of Football.

In late October 1998, Zajec replaced Zlatko Kranjčar as manager at Dinamo Zagreb (then known as Croatia Zagreb), following Kranjčar&#x27;s poor record in the UEFA Champions League group stage, where the team only managed to grab a single point in three matches (drawing with Ajax at home, before losing to both Olympiacos and Porto on the road). The team&#x27;s performance in the UEFA Champions League improved under Zajec, as they managed to stay undefeated in the remaining three group matches, beating Porto and Ajax and drawing with Olympiacos. Dinamo nevertheless did not manage to go through to the quarter-finals after finishing second in their group, behind Olympiacos (at the time, only the first-place finishers and the two best second-place finishers went through).

In 2004, he moved to English club Portsmouth to take up a position as executive director. He took over as temporary team manager following the resignation of Harry Redknapp in November 2004 and was confirmed as the new manager on 21 December 2004 making him the first Croatian to manage in the Premier league. Five months later, he reverted to his intended director&#x27;s role, following the arrival of Alain Perrin. He resigned from his position at Fratton Park on 10 October 2005 for personal reasons.

On 25 May 2010, Zajec was appointed new coach at Dinamo Zagreb, returning to the club as coach after 11 years. However, Zajec was sacked on 9 August 2010, after leading Dinamo in just 8 competitive matches, winning the 2010 Croatian Supercup, exiting the 2010–11 Champions League in the third qualifying round, and picking up four points in the first three matches in the 2010–11 Prva HNL.

On 8 February 2024, Zajec became the holder of the election list &quot;Dinamovo proljeće&quot; and therefore a candidate for Dinamo Zagreb&#x27;s president.

<doc id="1177175" wikidata="Q7085007" url="?curid=1177175" title="Old Southwest">
<text>The &quot;Old Southwest&quot; is an informal name for the southwestern frontier territories of the United States from the American Revolutionary War , through the early 1800s, at which point the US had acquired the Louisiana Territory, pushing the southwestern frontier toward what is today known as the Southwest.

After numerous wars and an ethnic cleansing campaign, this region was eventually divided among six states that joined the union as Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia and Florida. The portions of Georgia furthest from South Carolina and the Atlantic are usually considered part of this region. Conversely, the Florida peninsula (i.e. not including the Florida Panhandle) and the Appalachian portions of Tennessee and Kentucky are not always considered part of this region.

==Geography==

Historians usually describe the Old Southwest as bounded by the Mississippi River to the west, the Ohio, its tributary, to the north, the body of water these rivers flow into—the Gulf of Mexico—to the south, and to the east, the western boundaries of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. Much of northern, western, and southern Georgia is part of the Old Southwest, as the state did not grow into its modern boundaries until 1827. 

Historians usually include West Florida in the Old Southwest, but the peninsula of Florida, or East Florida, is often excluded. The Apalachicola River was the boundary between West Florida and East Florida until 1820. The Florida Parishes of Louisiana, lying east of the Mississippi, are part of the Old Southwest.

==History==

The Old Southwest includes the homelands of numerous American Indian nations, including the five so-called &quot;Five Civilized Tribes,&quot; the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole as well as the Shawnee. The European empires of Spain, France, and Great Britain competed with one another for monopolies on resource extraction and the allegiance of Native leaders in this region. In 1763, following the French and Indian War, France made peace with Great Britain and surrendered all its territorial claims east of the Mississippi River. That same year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 set the western border of the American colonies at the Appalachian mountains, but many settlers defied the order and occupied parts of the territory.

After the American Revolutionary War, in the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Britain ceded most of its North American territory to the United States, while Spain, a U.S. ally, took over in West and East Florida. In 1787 the United States Congress organized the Northwest Territory and established rules for founding new states, but the Old Southwest proved more difficult to manage. As was the case with the Northwest Territory, the states to the east each claimed overlapping territory extending to the Mississippi River.

Settler colonialists in Virginia&#x27;s western territory separated in 1790 and entered the union as the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1792. Settlers in portions of North Carolina&#x27;s western claims briefly attempted to organize as the state of Franklin in the 1780s. In 1790, all of North Carolina west of the Appalachians was organized as the Southwest Territory, and in 1796 this territory joined the union as the state of Tennessee. In the same decade, Georgia politicians conspired to sell off western land in the Yazoo land scandal. After this, the state relinquished its western claims to the federal government in 1802, in exchange for a promise to acquire all property belonging to Indians in Georgia. The federal government organized this acquisition as the Mississippi Territory, which was eventually divided and joined the union as Mississippi in 1817 and Alabama in 1819.

The Spanish province of West Florida extended along the Gulf Coast from the Mississippi River to the Apalachicola River. American incursions between 1811 and 1818 gradually absorbed most of West Florida. American troops annexed the port of Mobile in 1813, then occupied Pensacola. In 1819 Spain ceded all its Florida land to the United States.

Despite the Proclamation of 1763 prohibiting Anglo-American settlement in this region until the Treaty of Paris in 1783, by the 1790 census there were over 100,000 American settler-colonists in Kentucky and Tennessee alone, and by the 1800 census there were about 400,000 Americans in this region (including enslaved people). Members of Indigenous Nations were not US citizens until the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 and thus were not counted in the census. The US waged several wars of extermination against the Indigenous people of this region, including the Cherokee wars, the Creek War, and the Seminole Wars. Following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the American Indian Nations of this region were all but annihilated, surviving mainly in isolated rural pockets of land that were often unsuitable for agriculture and thus of little value to American settler-colonists. The only federally recognized American Indian groups in this region in the 21st century are the Mississippi Choctaw, the Poarch Band Creek in Alabama, and the Seminoles and Miccosukee in Florida. Their combined population was approximately 18,000 in 2020—over 11,000 of which were Mississippi Choctaw.

Following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, this region and the Old South gradually came to be collectively known as the Southeast, although the northeast portion of the Old South is sometimes instead considered part of the US Atlantic Midland. By the late 1840s, following the Mexican–American War, the term American Southwest referred mainly to the southern portion of the Mexican Cession.

==Economy==
The region&#x27;s climate and soils favored commodity agriculture over industrial development. Industrialization around the world made processing raw goods easier, and after the invention of the cotton gin, exporting cotton became a particularly lucrative enterprise. The 1803 Louisiana Purchase provided the fledgling United States with an enormous territory connected by the Mississippi and its tributaries, as well as a large seaport—New Orleans—that would facilitate global trade. By the 1840s, the Old Southwest states of Alabama and Mississippi had become wealthy by using slave labor and land acquired via ethnic cleansing to grow and export cotton.

<text>Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife (officially, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Board) is a governmental organisation responsible for maintaining wildlife conservation areas and biodiversity in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Their headquarters is in Queen Elizabeth Park situated on the northern slopes of Pietermaritzburg, the KwaZulu-Natal provincial capital. Prior to 1994, it was known as the Natal Parks Board.

==History==

The first known person to provide protection to wildlife in the region was Zulu King Shaka, who prevented excessive hunting of game animals in the Umfolozi River valley in the early 19th century. However King Shaka used this area for his own hunting purposes and cannot be classed as a &#x27;preservationist&#x27;.

Voortrekkers, who entered the region now known as KwaZulu-Natal in the early 19th century, also had conservation policies. The Voortrekker leader Piet Retief had rules excluding the unnecessary shooting of game, and veld burning was strictly controlled.

Zulu King Mpande is known to have afforded protection to the Ongoye Forest. He is also said to have issued an edict preventing the killing of large game animals.

The Durban Botanic Garden was founded in 1859, and although founded for studies into economically important exotic plants, soon became a centre for the study of local plants, and ultimately led to realising the importance of protecting areas of natural vegetation.

In 1866, the Natal Government drew up the first game laws at a time when Zululand was still independent. Zululand was annexed in 1887 and this allowed the exploitation of game animals by immigrants.

The decimation of the wildlife was noted by both hunters and early naturalists, and in 1895 the first game reserves were proclaimed. These included; Umfolozi junction, St Lucia, Hluhluwe valley and Pongolo-Umkuzi. Many years followed where conflict arose over disease spreading from the protected game and a difference in priorities was evident between conservationists and farmers. Some game reserves were deproclaimed and the Nagana Campaign was implemented, which caused severe degradation of ecosystems.

In 1947, the Natal Parks, Game and Fish Preservation Board was established to enforce laws relating to wildlife in Natal and Zululand, which by that time were a single province of South Africa known as Natal. The name of the organisation was later simplified to the Natal Parks Board.

In 1982, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi established the KwaZulu Bureau of Natural Resources, later renamed the KwaZulu Department of Nature Conservation, which managed conservation areas in the former KwaZulu homeland under the Apartheid Government.

After the end of Apartheid the Natal Parks Board and KwaZulu Department of Nature Conservation became a single organisation, which was eventually called the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service. More recently the name was changed to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.

== Conservation ==

The Natal Parks Board was instrumental in saving the southern white rhino (&quot;Ceratotherium simum simum&quot;) from extinction. All southern white rhinos today (over 20,000 individuals) are descended from the remnant population of Umfolozi. Today Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife is involved with saving a subspecies of the south-central black rhinoceros (&quot;Diceros bicornis minor&quot;), of which virtually all of the animals now living in South Africa are descended from the remnant population of Umfolozi.

The areas managed by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife include marine turtle nesting sites (loggerhead and leatherback turtles), coelacanth habitat and three centres of endemism. Two of the areas managed are World Heritage Sites (iSimangaliso and uKhahlamba).

== Controversies ==
In 2023, Karpowership bought and gifted a game farm to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife in exchange for not objecting to mooring a 450 MW ship-mounted power plant at Richards Bay Harbour.

== Finances ==
In 2022/23, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife received in grants from the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs. In 2022/23, it had a net deficit R 45.6 million.

=== Auditor&#x27;s concerns ===
In the 2022/23 annual report, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife received a qualified opinion due to irregular expenditure and misstating property, plant and equipment values, in addition to not having recorded various assets. The auditor-general stated that &quot;a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the KZN Nature Conservation Board&#x27;s ability to continue as a going concern.&quot;Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife had attained a deficit for the prior year and in 2023.

<text>The GP-25 &quot;Kostyor (&quot;Bonfire&quot;),GP-30 &quot;Obuvka (&quot;Shoe&quot;) and GP-34 are a family of Russian 40 mm under-barrel muzzleloaded grenade launchers for the AK family of assault rifles. The acronym GP stands for &quot;Granatomyot Podstvolnyj&quot;, &quot;under-barrel grenade launcher&quot; in Russian, and was adopted by Soviet forces in 1978.

== Development ==

The development of a grenade launcher for the AKM assault rifle began in 1966 at the Central Design and Research Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms (TsKIB SOO). Development continued into the 1970s, and in 1978 it was accepted into service. The initial version was designated the BG-15 &quot;Mukha&quot; (&quot;Fly&quot;), and was mounted under the barrel of the AK-74 assault rifle. The main production version, the GP-25, has a different aiming system. The GP-30 was made lighter and the aiming system was redesigned and moved to the right.

GP grenade launchers are similar in appearance and fire the same Russian 40mm caliber ammunition. At the top of the barrel is the mounting hardware to attach the weapon to the underside of a rifle barrel, from which it is designed to fire. The GP barrel has a useful life of about 400 rounds.

The GP-30 first entered service in 1989, and is intended for use with the AK-100 series of assault rifles. The GP-30M is a grenade launcher of simplified model, consisting of a shorter 40mm rifled barrel in front of a basic trigger mechanism with minimal hand grip.

The current Izhmash-made version, the GP-34, has a further-redesigned sighting system located to the right side of the weapon and features the following advantages:
* Reliability: It is designed and tested specifically for the Kalashnikov assault rifles, fits such assault rifles directly without any adaptors or hand guard dismantling.
* Improved safety: The design prevents a round from moving within or falling out of the barrel, even if the muzzle is pointed down. The GP-34 features an additional mechanism (firing pin safety lever) to improve safety during loading.

=== Variants ===
* ГП-25 (&quot;GP-25&quot;), GRAU index: 6Г15 (&quot;6G15&quot;), nickname «Костёр» (&quot;Kostyor&quot;, &quot;Bonfire&quot;)
* ГП-30 (&quot;GP-30&quot;), GRAU index: 6Г21 (&quot;6G21&quot;), nickname «Обувка» (&quot;Obuvka&quot;, &quot;Shoe&quot;)
* ГП-34 (&quot;GP-34&quot;), GRAU index: 6Г34 (&quot;6G34&quot;)

== Use ==
A grenade is first loaded from the muzzle, the weapon is aimed, and then the double-action trigger is pulled to fire. This fires the percussion cap at the base of the grenade which activates the nitrocellulose propellant inside the grenade body. The hot, expanding gas from the propellant is forced through openings in the base of the grenade that move it along the barrel and, at the same time, force the driving band to fit into the twelve grooves of the rifle. The rifling provides stabilizing rotation to the projectile. The grenade has a range of up to 400m.

== Ammunition ==

GP grenade launchers fire multiple 40mm VOG-25 high-explosive fragmentation grenades, with a total range of 400 meters and an effective range of 150m. These Russian-Soviet 40 mm grenades are not compatible with Western 40x46mm grenades. Originally, the main grenade was the VOG-15 (7P17) fragmentation grenade, which has a lethal radius of six meters. Ammunition for the muzzle-loading GP-25 consists of a single piece containing propellant and charge, as opposed to the more traditional two-piece case and projectile design of comparable US 40x46mm ammunition used in breech-loading grenade launchers, such as the M203. This integral &quot;caseless&quot; design – with the propellant and primer contained in the base of the grenade – provides for when the grenade is fired nothing is left in the barrel, so the operator can load the next grenade.

A bouncing grenade, the VOG-25P, is also available. On impact, a small charge in the nose of the grenade explodes; this raises the grenade 50cm to 1.5m in the air, before an impact delay fuse causes it to detonate. The VOG-25P also has a lethal radius of six meters. The new generation VOG-M and VOG-PM ammunition, with an increased effectiveness of no less than 1.5 times, are now serially available.

Smoke grenades are also available. The original GRD-40 grenade was replaced by a series of grenades designed for use at different ranges. These are the GRD-50, GRD-100 and GRD-200 intended for use at 50, 100 and 200 meters respectively. They are capable of producing a 20 cubic meter cloud of smoke that lasts for one minute in winds of up to five meters per second. A tear gas grenade called &quot;Gvozd&quot; (&quot;Nail&quot;) and a stick grenade are also available.

<text>Ted Chudleigh (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014, representing the ridings of Halton North and later Halton. Chudleigh is the grandson of Thomas Laird Kennedy, who served as Premier of Ontario in 1949.

==Background==
Chudleigh was born in Peel County, Ontario in 1943. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Michigan State University in 1965. He later worked for the Ministry of Agriculture, and owned an IGA store in the Niagara Region. From 1980 to 1995, he was the Executive Vice-President of the &quot;Ontario Food Processors Association&quot;. His brother Tom Chudleigh is the owner of Chudleigh&#x27;s Limited, a commercial bakery and farm based in the Milton area whose frozen desserts are sold by grocery retailers throughout North America.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Walt Elliot and incumbent New Democrat Noel Duignan in the riding of Halton North. He was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Halton in the 1999 provincial election, by a margin of over 20,000 votes over his closest opponent. Chudleigh served as a backbench supporter for Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

The Tories lost the provincial election of 2003, and Chudleigh was returned with a greatly reduced margin of victory. He endorsed Frank Klees&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party in 2004.

Ted Chudleigh was re-elected as the MPP for Halton in the 2007 provincial election by 176 votes over the Liberal candidate Gary Zemlak, and was re-elected for a fifth time in 2011 by more than 3,000 votes over Liberal candidate Indira Naidoo-Harris. In 2014, Chudleigh faced Naidoo-Harris again, this time losing to her by about 4,000 votes.

During his time in government he served as Parliamentary Assistant to several ministers. During his time in opposition he was his party&#x27;s critic for various roles and between 2004 and 2011 he served as Deputy Opposition Whip.

<text>The Turn the Web Black protest, also called the Great Web Blackout, the Turn Your Web Pages Black protest, and Black Thursday, was a February 8–9, 1996, online activism action, led by the Voters&#x27; Telecommunications Watch and the Center for Democracy and Technology, paralleling the longer-term Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign organized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It protested the Communications Decency Act (CDA), a piece of rider legislation for Internet censorship attached to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and passed by the United States Congress on February 1, 1996. Timed to coincide with President Bill Clinton&#x27;s signing of the bill on February 8, 1996, numerous websites had their background color turned to black for 48 hours to protest the CDA&#x27;s perceived curtailment of freedom of expression. Thousands of websites, including a number of major ones, joined in the protest. The campaign was noted by major media outlets such as CNN, &quot;Time&quot; magazine and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

== Background ==
The legislation which gave rise to the protest threatened fines or imprisonment for those accused of distributing &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; materials without providing some way of blocking access to minors. Opponents of the bill compared this to demanding librarians assess the age of library users before allowing them access to a particular book in the collection.

The Communications Decency Act was stuck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 9–0 vote on June 26, 1997, upholding an earlier federal district court ruling. The majority of Justices found the CDA violated adults&#x27; First Amendment free speech rights with its overbroad suppression and vague language, despite any legitimate interest of the government in protecting children from &quot;harmful materials&quot;. A concurring minority opinion, penned by Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, argued that the law might have been constitutional if limited to situations concerning an intent and knowledge to provide indecent materials to children.

<text>A pennon, also known as a pennant or pendant, is a long narrow flag which is larger at the hoist than at the fly, i.e., the flag narrows as it moves away from the flagpole. It can have several shapes, such as triangular, tapering (square tail) or triangular swallowtail (forked tail), etc. In maritime use, pennants are to be hung from the main truck.

Pennon-style flags were one of the principal three varieties of flags carried during the Middle Ages (the other two were the banner and the standard). The pennon is a flag resembling the guidon in shape, but only half the size. It does not contain any coat of arms, but only crests, mottos and heraldic and ornamental devices.

Pennoncell, streamer and wimpel are minor varieties of this style of flag (see variant types).

== Etymology ==
Pennon comes from the Latin &quot;penna&quot;, meaning &quot;a wing&quot; or &quot;a feather&quot;. Initially it was a term for a &quot;small pennant&quot;.

Pennant have been used as a general (and imprecise) term for flags which are not strictly rectangular.

Pendant is an obsolete spelling of pennant.

== Description ==
The pennon was sometimes pointed, but more generally forked or swallow-tailed at the end. In the 11th century, the pennon was generally square, the fly end being decorated with the addition of pointed tongues or streamers, somewhat similar to the oriflamme. During the reign of Henry III, the pennon acquired the distinctive swallow-tail, or the single-pointed shape. Another version of the single-pointed pennon was introduced in the 13th century. In shape this was a scalene triangle, obtained by cutting diagonally the vertically oblong banner.

== Usage ==
The pennon was a purely personal ensign. It was essentially the flag of the knight bachelor, as apart from the knight banneret, carried by him on his lance, displaying his personal armorial bearings, and set out so that they stood in correct position when he couched his lance for charging. A manuscript of the 16th century (Harl. 2358, &quot;A paper Heraldical book in small Quarto&quot;) in the British Museum, which gives detailed particulars as to the size, shape and bearings of the standards, banners, pennons and pennoncells, says &quot;a pennon must be two yards and a half long, made round at the end, and contain the arms of the owner,&quot; and warns that &quot;from a standard or streamer a man may flee but not from his banner or pennon bearing his arms.&quot; A pennoncell (or penselle) was a diminutive pennon carried by the esquires.

Pennons were also used for any special ceremonial occasion, and more particularly at state funerals. For instance, there were &quot;XII doz. penselles&quot; among the items that figured at the funeral of the Duke of Norfolk in 1554, and in the description of the lord mayor&#x27;s procession in 1555, it reads &quot;two goodly pennes (state barges) decked with flags and streamers, and a 1000 penselles.&quot; Among the items that ran the total cost of the funeral of Oliver Cromwell up to an enormous sum of money, there is the mention of 30 dozen of pennoncells a foot long and costing 20 shillings a dozen, and 20 dozen of the same kind of flags at 12 shillings a dozen.

=== Sports ===

Pennons were also used in various sports.

== Variant types ==
The streamer, so called in Tudor days but now better known as the pennant or pendant, was a long, tapering flag, which it was directed &quot;shall stand in the top of a ship or in the forecastle, and therein be put no arms, but the man&#x27;s cognisance or device, and may be of length 20, 30, 40 or , and is slit as well as a guidon or standard&quot;. Among the fittings of the ship that took Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, to France in the reign of Henry VII was a &quot;great streamer for the ship in length [and] in breadth&quot;.

Besides the white ensign, ships commissioned in the Royal Navy fly a long streamer from the maintopgallant masthead. This, which is called a pennant, is the sign of command, and is first hoisted when a captain commissions his ship. The pennant, which was really the old &quot;pennoncell&quot;, was of three colours for the whole of its length, and towards the end left separate in two or three tails, and so continued until the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Now, however the pennant is a long white streamer with the St George&#x27;s cross in the inner portion close to the mast. Pennants have been carried by men-of-war from the earliest times, prior to 1653 at the yard-arm, but since that date at the maintopgallant masthead. There are other navies that also fly pennant in a similar manner (see commissioning pennant).

The commissioning pennant in ships may end in a point, but they can also be forked, in which case it is also called a banderole.

Pennants are also associated with American sports teams, such as Major League Baseball and college sports teams. In Australian rules football, a pennant is awarded to the winner of major competitions. For many years, this was the only prize given. As a result, a League Championship is often referred to as a &quot;pennant&quot;, as in, &quot;The Giants win the Pennant!&quot; And in Australian football, a premiership can also be referred to as a &quot;flag&quot;.

== The Dutch pennon ==
In the Netherlands, an orange pennon is always used on the King&#x27;s Day and several other national holidays related to the House of Orange. It is flown alongside the standard Dutch flag. The Dutch provinces each have a pennon as well.

<text>The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology (RTMP; often referred to as the Royal Tyrrell Museum) is a palaeontology museum and research facility in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. The museum was named in honour of Joseph Burr Tyrrell, and is situated within a designed by BCW Architects at Midland Provincial Park.

Efforts to establish a palaeontology museum were announced by the provincial government in 1981, with the palaeontology program of the Provincial Museum of Alberta spun-off to help facilitate the creation of a palaeontology museum. After four years of preparation, the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology was opened in September 1985. The museum was later renamed the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in June 1990, following its bestowal of the title &quot;royal&quot; from Queen Elizabeth II. The museum&#x27;s building was expanded twice in the 21st century. The first expansion was designed by BCW Architects, and was completed in 2003; while the second expansion was designed by Kasian Architecture, and was completed in 2019.

The museum&#x27;s personal collection includes over 160,000 cataloged fossils, consisting of over 350 holotypes, providing the museum with the largest collection of fossils in Canada. The museum displays approximately 800 fossils from its collection in its museum exhibits. In addition to exhibits, the museum&#x27;s fossil collection are also used by the museum&#x27;s research program, which carries a mandate to document and analyze geological and palaeontological history.

== History ==

During the late 1970s, the government of Alberta began to consider building within, or adjacent to Dinosaur Provincial Park. In 1981, the provincial government formally announced plans to build a palaeontology museum. However, the museum was built in Midland Provincial Park near Drumheller, as opposed to Dinosaur Provincial Park. The construction of the museum formed a part of a larger initiative from premier Peter Lougheed, to establish a network of provincially-operated museums and interpretive centres in select small towns and rural areas throughout Alberta. The provincial government had allocated C$30 million to build the museum. The development of the museum was largely led by the institution&#x27;s first director, David Baird.

The Provincial Museum of Alberta&#x27;s palaeontology program, including its collection, and a large portion of its staff, was spun-off in 1981 in preparation for the opening of the new museum. The staff of the future palaeontology museum worked in a temporary office space in downtown Edmonton until 1982, when they were relocated to another temporary office, laboratory, and workshop in Drumheller. Prior to opening, the museum&#x27;s informal working name was the &quot;Palaeontological Museum and Research Institute&quot;, although it was changed by Baird to the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, in honour of Joseph Tyrrell, a geologist of the Geological Survey of Canada. Tyrrell accidentally discovered the first reported dinosaur fossil at the Red Deer River valley, while searching for coal seams in 1884. 

The Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology was opened to the public on 25 September 1985. In the same year, the museum announced its participation the China-Canada Dinosaur Project, the institution&#x27;s first collaborative, out-of-province research project. The collaborative effort marked the first meaningful collaboration between Chinese and western palaeontologists since the Chinese Communist Revolution.

On 28 June 1990, the museum was renamed the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, after it was bestowed the title &quot;royal&quot; by Queen Elizabeth II. The museum&#x27;s volunteer support group, the Royal Tyrrell Museum Cooperating Society, was formed in 1993, and helps fund museum-sanctioned research projects, publications, postdoctoral fellowships, and other museum-centred events.

In 2003, the museum completed its first major expansion to its building, the ATCO Tyrrell Learning Centre annex.

Plans to expand the museum&#x27;s building again were underway as early as 2013, although the museum did not announce its plans to expand the museum building until 2016. The expansion plan saw the construction of a learning lounge annex, that increased the building&#x27;s size by an additional . The learning lounge annex was created in response to the feedback received from the museum, which requested more hands-on exhibits and activities at the museum. The expansion for the museum was funded by the provincial and federal governments, costing approximately C$9.3 million. The provincial government provided C$5.7 million, while the remaining C$3.5 million was provided by the federal government. The expansion marks the first time the museum&#x27;s received cultural infrastructure funding from the federal government. The learning lounge annex was formally opened to the public on 28 June 2019.

==Grounds==

The museum is located on North Dinosaur Trail at Midland Provincial Park, in Drumheller, Alberta. The area which the museum occupies is situated in the middle of the fossil-bearing strata of the Late Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The Badlands Interpretive Trail is a hiking trail northeast to the museum building, and is used extensively by the museum public and school programs.

===Building===
The building was designed to function as a museum, and as a laboratory/research facility. The original structure was completed in 1985, and was expanded twice in the 21st century. The original structure and its first expansion has a total area of of space. The original structure, with its first expansion holds approximately worth of exhibit space. The building&#x27;s second expansion annex comprise approximately of space, bringing the approximate total area of the museum building to .

The original building was designed by the Calgary-based BCW Architects, with Doug Craig as the lead architect. Although the design was largely left to Craig, he was given a list of 27 architectural requirements from the museum&#x27;s director. Several of these requirements included the necessity to harmonize the building with the surrounding badlands, make the entrance easy to locate by routing the driveway to pass the front of the building, and providing adequate space for visitors&#x27; eyes to adjust from the light outside and inside the building. The main structure includes several galleries with interactive displays, a cafeteria, gift shop, and a theatre. The museum&#x27;s main lobby features a mural made of ten ceramic panels; titled &quot;The Story of Life&quot;, the mural was crafted by Lorraine Malach.

The museum contracted BCW Architects again to help design the ATCO Tyrrell Learning Centre, a to the main museum. The ATCO Tyrrell Learning Centre was completed in 2003 and included several classrooms with distance learning technology to allows researchers to remotely connect with field sites, and a laboratory. The ATCO Tyrrell Learning Centre was designed to accommodate students from elementary to post-secondary levels of education.

In 2019, the museum completed construction of a learning lounge, adding approximately to the main building. The learning lounge expansion was designed by Kasian Architecture, along with the museum, and the government of Alberta. LEAR Construction, a Calgary-based construction firm, was contracted to build the learning lounge expansion. The expansion saw the Distance Learning Studio and accessible washrooms enlarged, as well as the creation of additional classrooms, laboratory spaces, an interactive learning lounge and rest area, and other multipurpose rooms.

==Exhibits==
As of 2020, the museum building houses thirteen exhibits that display approximately 800 fossils on permanent display. Audio-visual, interactive computers, and video programs and displays typically provide relevant information on the items in the exhibit. Several artistic works by Vladimir Krb are also exhibited in the museum&#x27;s exhibits.

A number of these exhibits are organized by geologic eras, displaying specimens and dioramas from those periods. These exhibits includes Cenozoic Gallery, Cretaceous Alberta, Cretaceous Garden, Palaeozoic Era, and Terrestrial Palaeozoic. The Cretaceous Alberta exhibit features a diorama of an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; pack inspired by 22 specimens found in a bonebed in Alberta, as an homage to Joseph Tyrrell, who first discovered the dinosaur. 

Several exhibits are also organized by locale, or focused on a specific fossil-bearing deposit, such as the Burgess Shale exhibit. The Grounds for Discovery exhibit displays specimens found from commercial and industrial digs. The world&#x27;s most well-preserved thyreophora is situated within the Grounds for Discovery exhibit, a fossil of a &quot;Borealopelta&quot; found by oil sand workers at the Athabasca oil sands.

Other exhibits that display specimens from the museum&#x27;s fossil collection includes the Dinosaur Hall, Fossils in Focus, and Triassic Giants. Dinosaur Hall houses over thirty mounted dinosaur skeletons including specimens of an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, and a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, including Black Beauty, the fourteenth-most complete skeleton of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in the world. Fossils in Focus is an exhibit that typically displays specimens of interest for the museum&#x27;s research program. Triassic Giants is an exhibit dedicated to Elizabeth Nicholls, the museum&#x27;s former curator of marine reptiles, and houses a specimen of a &quot;Shonisaurus&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest marine reptile. 

Along with exhibits that are primarily concerned with the exhibition of specimens and dioramas, the museum also has two exhibits related on palaeontology, &quot;Foundations&quot;, and &quot;Preparation Lab&quot;; the latter exhibit allowing visitors to watch technicians as they prepare fossils for exhibits or research. Other exhibits in the museum includes the Cretaceous Garden, which is designed to mimic the Albertan environment during the Cretaceous era by planting living relatives of the vegetation that grew in Alberta during that era. Opened in 2019, the Learning Lounge is the museum&#x27;s newest exhibit, and serves as the museum&#x27;s interactive and hands-on exhibit, and includes a bronze statue of an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, and interactive displays on how dinosaurs ate, moved, and interacted with other organisms.

===Gallery===
==Collection==
As of 2020, the museum&#x27;s collection held over 350 holotypes, and approximately 160,000 cataloged fossils; providing the museum with the largest fossil collection in Canada. As of November 2021, the museum&#x27;s collection holds five Guinness World Records due to its unique collection of fossils; including the best-preserved &quot;Borealopelta&quot;, and a &quot;Albertonectes&quot; fossil that has the longest neck recorded.

Items from the collection are either used for research, or for museum exhibits. Approximately 0.5 per cent of the collection are placed on display in the museum&#x27;s exhibits.

Approximately half of these items are fossils dating back to the Cretaceous period. The majority of these fossils originate from Alberta, with approximately 85 per cent of the fossils from the province being collected from the museum&#x27;s fieldwork. In addition to the Cretaceous fossils of Alberta, the museum also holds a number of fossils from the Palaeocene of Alberta, the Palaeozoic of the Canadian Arctic, and in the Palaeozoic, Triassic, and Early Cretaceous of British Columbia.

Besides fieldwork, the museum has also acquired items for its collection through a variety of other means, including donations, exchanges, purchases, salvage operations of industrial excavations, and from palaeontologists archiving their works at the museum. Most of the specimens that were purchased were acquired in the early 1980s, when the institution was provided a large acquisition budget in preparation for its opening. Approximately 3,000 specimens are added to the collection annually.

==Programs==

Guided tours of the surrounding Midland Provincial Park are offered by the museum staff. The museum also operate several outreach programs, providing students hands-on field training, and conducting several &quot;pay-to-dig&quot; programs in the Drumheller area, where members of the public participate in bonebed excavation. The museum has a suite of distance learning programs, providing educational programming to students.

The museum operates a casting and molding program where it creates replicas of specimens from its own collections, providing them for use to other museums.

===Research===

The museum research program has a broad mandate to document and analyze geological and palaeontological history, with reference to Alberta. The museum&#x27;s research program includes a palaeontological research group, as well as a rotating roster of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Palaeontological technicians of the museum assist, or oversee fieldwork operations; as well as prepare fossils for exhibits, or research. In 2015, the museum&#x27;s group of palaeontological technicians had collectively over 150 years of cumulative experience. Although formally not employed for the purposes of research, palaeontological technicians have performed independent, or collaborative research projects at the museum in the past.

The majority of the research papers authored by members of the museum&#x27;s research program is devoted to vertebrates, with its members having published less than 40 papers on macro plants, palynomorphs, and invertebrates as of 2015. Findings from the research program are regularly incorporated into the museum&#x27;s exhibits, and educational outreach programs.

The museum&#x27;s research team was initially founded in the early 1980s, and was initially tasked with searching for specimens for the museum&#x27;s exhibits and collections. After the demand for exhibit-quality specimens was met, the museum&#x27;s researchers were reoriented towards documenting and interpreting the geology, and fossils of Midland Provincial Park, Dinosaur Provincial Park, and other areas in the province. The museum has maintained a permanent field station at Dinosaur Provincial Park since 1987. Other areas in Canada where the museum&#x27;s research program has conducted fieldwork includes British Columbia, the Canadian Arctic, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

The museum has conducted a number of research collaborations with other institutions, including the Geological Survey of Canada, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, other museums in North America, and universities based in Alberta. Many of the museum&#x27;s research projects are based in Alberta, although it has conducted research projects out of the province. As of 2015, the museum has participated in 10 collaborative, and externally-funded research projects outside of Alberta, the first being the Sino-Canadian Dinosaur Project in 1985. As of 2015, these collaborative, out-of-province research projects has resulted in over 75 research publications.

<text>George William Grider (October 1, 1912 – March 20, 1991) was a United States Navy Captain, an attorney, and a Democratic U.S. Representative from Tennessee from 1965 to 1967.

==Early life==
Grider was born in Memphis, Tennessee, son of John McGavock Grider, (killed in action, World War I, aviation), and the brother of John McGavock Grider Jr. As a youth, he attended the public schools and received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy (USNA) in Annapolis, Maryland, where he was graduated and received his naval commission in 1936. While at Annapolis, he married in secret in contravention to USNA regulations, and was officially married in 1938.

==Naval career==

After Grider&#x27;s commission as an Ensign, he was assigned to the USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; (BB-41), as catapult officer, and subsequently to the USS &quot;Rathburne&quot; (DD-113).

After this service Grider was assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Submarine Warfare School, and following his successful completion of its requirements was assigned to one of the World War II era&#x27;s most accomplished submarines, the
USS &quot;Skipjack&quot; (SS-184).

Grider was serving as an instructor at the Fleet Sonar School in San Diego, California, at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, and then assigned to a submarine deployed in the defense of San Diego during the time after the attack when both naval and civilian officials wondered if the attack was to be followed by an attempted Japanese invasion of the West Coast.

Subsequently, Grider was assigned to the as Engineering Officer, serving behind Dudley W. Morton and Richard O&#x27;Kane, and then to two billets as executive officer, on the , and the
. After this, he was given command of the , and then . For his service Grider was awarded the Navy Cross. Grider told the story of his World War II experiences in the submarine service in the book &quot;War Fish&quot; which he wrote with Lydel Sims, published in 1958 by Little, Brown and Company.

Grider was forced to retire from active naval service at the rank of captain in 1947 after suffering a heart attack. He then enrolled in the law school of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was graduated with a law degree in 1950 and then, subsequent to his admission to the Tennessee bar, began the practice of law in Memphis.

==World War II Summary==


==Public service and later life==
In 1956 and 1957, Grider served on the Memphis Planning Commission, and from 1959 to 1964, the Shelby County Quarterly Court (in reality a legislative rather than a judicial body, it was the predecessor to the body today serving as the Shelby County Commission). It was from this office that Grider launched a successful campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District seat in the August 1964 Democratic primary, defeating 13-term incumbent Clifford Davis, a holdover from the era of E. H. &quot;Boss&quot; Crump&#x27;s domination of Memphis politics. Grider did not have an easy time in the November election, however. Republican influence was on the rise in the Memphis area, largely due to a massive crossover of white voters from the Democrats. Grider won by only five percentage points. He likely would not have won had it not been for Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s gigantic landslide in that year&#x27;s presidential election. He was one of two naval veterans elected to the House from western Tennessee in that election, the other being William Anderson. Grider voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

However, Grider was to serve only one term in the House; in November 1966 he was defeated for reelection by Shelby County Republican Party former co-chairman Dan Kuykendall, in what was a very good year for Republicans in Tennessee (Howard Baker was elected to the first of three Senate terms) and nationally (where the huge Democratic advantages in both houses of Congress and in governorships were considerably reduced). Kuykendall had specific advantages: he had done surprisingly well as the Republican nominee in the United States Senate race against Albert Gore, Sr. two years earlier, and there was no Republican gubernatorial nominee in Tennessee that year. Kuykendall also took advantage of the large number of white Memphis-area Democrats switching to the Republicans. Ordinarily, the lack of a gubernatorial race would be considered a political disadvantage, but in fact it allowed Tennessee Republicans to concentrate their resources on winnable races, such as those faced by Kuykendall and Baker. Grider was the last white Democrat to represent a significant portion of Memphis until State Senator Steve Cohen was elected to Congress from the Ninth District in 2006.

Following his defeat, Grider moved to Niagara Falls, New York, where he served for eight years as vice president and general counsel for the Carborundum Company, an abrasives manufacturer.

In 1975 Grider returned to Memphis and resumed the practice of law there, and was still living in the city of his birth at the time of his death in 1991. He was buried at the Memphis National Cemetery.

<text>The baritone guitar is a guitar with a longer scale length, typically a larger body, and heavier internal bracing, so it can be tuned to a lower pitch. Gretsch, Fender, Gibson, Ibanez, ESP Guitars, PRS Guitars, Music Man, Danelectro, Schecter, Burns London and many other companies have produced electric baritone guitars since the 1960s, although always in small numbers due to low popularity. Tacoma, Santa Cruz, Taylor, Martin, Alvarez Guitars, Ovation Guitar Company and others have made acoustic baritone guitars.

==Use==
The baritone-tuned guitar was uncommon until the Danelectro Company introduced an electric baritone guitar in 1956. The electric baritone found some popularity in surf music and film scores, particularly &quot;spaghetti Westerns.&quot; &quot;Tic-tac bass&quot; is a method of playing, in which a muted baritone guitar doubles the part played by the bass guitar or double bass. The method is commonly used in country music.

==Tuning and string gauges==
A standard guitar&#x27;s standard tuning (from lowest–pitched string to highest) is E2–A2–D3–G3–B3–E4. While no standard tuning has been established for baritone guitars, popular tunings for the instrument are: a perfect fourth lower than a standard guitar (B1–E2–A2–D3–F3–B3), a perfect fifth lower (A1–D2–G2–C3–E3–A3), or a major third lower (C2–F2–B2–E3–G3–C4). Typically strung with 13 gauge (.013–.062), or 14 gauge (.014–.068) baritone guitar strings. 12 gauge (.012–.060) guitar strings can also be used.

Baritone acoustic guitars typically have larger bodies than standard guitars, and have longer scale lengths so the strings can be tuned lower while remaining at normal tension. On a standard guitar, the scale length (the distance from the nut to the saddle on the bridge) is typically . The most common scale lengths on a baritone range from .

==Baritone guitarists==

===Early adopters (1960s)===
In the 1960s, it was often tuned an octave down from standard guitar tuning; therefore, these recordings used a retuned baritone guitar as a six-string bass.
The Danelectro baritone was used by guitarist Duane Eddy in numerous recordings, including &quot;Bonnie Came Back&quot;, &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot;, &quot;Kommotion&quot;, &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, &quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot;, and &quot;The Son of Rebel Rouser&quot;. The instrument was used almost exclusively on his best-selling 1960 album &quot;The Twang&#x27;s the Thang&quot; and appears regularly on singles and albums throughout his career. The &quot;twangy&quot; sound of his guitars (which include Duane Eddy custom-builts by Guild, Gretsch and Gibson) augmented the even deeper twangy sound made by the Danelectro baritone. Eddy used the familiar black model and an unusual gray &quot;Longhorn&quot; model.

Brian Wilson occasionally included baritone guitars in his arrangements for The Beach Boys records, such as in &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; (recorded 1964 and released 1965; played by Ray Pohlman) and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (recorded 1966 and 1971, released 1967; played by Al Casey).

Singer Jimmie Rodgers also favored the baritone guitar, which can be heard in the opening bars of his recording of &quot;Woman from Liberia&quot; (1960).

Singer Glen Campbell used a baritone electric guitar on several of his big hit songs, most notably &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; and &quot;Galveston&quot;, where he played a distinctive baritone solo following the melody in both songs.

=== In country music ===
Although they have never been as popular as their standard counterparts, baritone guitars have always had a presence in country music, often utilized for their deep, warm resonance and the body they provide to an otherwise bright mix. The following artists have played and recorded with a baritone and guitar:

* Sara Evans utilizes a baritone guitar in her song Suds In The Bucket.

His specific instruments are ESP Custom 7 string used in Strapping Young Lad, his Peavey signature Flying V, and the &quot;Ziltoid&quot; Flying V built by Framus.
*Stephen Carpenter of Deftones began using baritone 7-strings in 2002, due to his constant exploration in down-tuning. While previous albums were recorded with standard-scaled 6-strings tuned to as low as drop C, their 2003 self-titled album was recorded with a baritone 7-string tuned to G.
*Other baritone 7-string artists include Jeff Loomis of Nevermore, who has used baritone Schecters since 2002 and currently has several signature models. The deathcore band Whitechapel has recently made use of baritone guitars, and have released signature models with ESP that feature baritone scale lengths.
*Josh Middleton and Adam Christianson of progressive metalcore band Architects use baritone 6 string ESP, Ibanez, LSL and Mayones guitars, tuned to a variation of C standard, where the bottom string is tuned to either G or F. This tuning was first utilized by late guitarist and co-founder of the band, Tom Searle, with the G tuning making its first appearance on the 2009 album &quot;Hollow Crown&quot;, and the F tuning first appearing on the 2014 album &quot;Lost Forever // Lost Together&quot;. Both tunings are still used by the band in their newer music.

<text>The Glenbow Museum is an art and history regional museum in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The museum focuses on Western Canadian history and culture, including Indigenous perspectives. The Glenbow was established as a private non-profit foundation in 1955 by lawyer, businessman and philanthropist Eric Lafferty Harvie with materials from his personal collection.

The museum moved to its current facility in downtown Calgary in 1976, and is funded by the governments of Calgary, Alberta, and Canada, private donors, as well as an endowment provided by Harvie. In 2019, the Glenbow had a total of 148,668 visitors. The museum closed for renovations in 2021 and is scheduled to re-open in 2026.

Admission to the museum is free as of February 2022, due to a $25 million donation by the Shaw Family Foundation. $15 million of the donation will be placed in an endowment fund for admissions, and $10 million is earmarked for the new JR Shaw Institute for Canadian Art.

The Glenbow Museum&#x27;s origin begins with Alberta lawyer and businessman Eric Lafferty Harvie. Harvie was active in the oil and gas industry in the 1920s–30s serving as director of the W. S. Herron&#x27;s Okaita Oils, and solicitor for British-American Oil&#x27;s operations in Turner Valley. Beginning in 1941, Harvie purchased mineral rights in the Edmonton region and leased the rights to the Imperial Oil Company which drilled Leduc No. 1, a major oil discovery. Harvie became a millionaire overnight, and after other strikes on his mineral rights in Redwater, Harvie&#x27;s fortune continued to grow.

Harvie founded the Glenbow Foundation, named after Harvie&#x27;s ranch and the Canadian Pacific Railway station 1.9 miles east of Cochrane, in 1955 with the goal of promoting a better understanding of the history and heritage of Western Canada, primarily through collecting and preserving art, documents and artifacts. The original goal of the organization was to collect artifacts and rely on partnerships and other museums to exhibit the collection. The foundation was headquartered in the William Roper Hull Ranche House, the former home of prominent businessman and meatpacker William Roper Hull. The early foundation consisted of a library, archives, art collection, Historical research division and the Luxton Museum in Banff, but later expanded to include photography, archaeology, ethnology and a museum division. As the Foundation, the institution funded archeological projects including that of Richard Forbis in 1958–59 at Old Women&#x27;s Buffalo Jump.

Harvie sought to collect elements of Western Canadian culture and history, which were not highly sought after at the time, allowing the collection to grow quickly with donations deemed by their owners to be &quot;junk&quot;, and low cost purchases for the foundation. The foundation&#x27;s collection quickly outgrew the Hull Ranche House, and collections were moved offsite, including the archaeology division to the University of Calgary when the school founded an archaeology department. Harvie was especially interested in collecting artifacts from Indigenous peoples of North America, which was reflected in his choice of first director of the foundation Douglas Leechman. While the foundation focused on collecting Western Canadian artifacts, Harvie continued to collect artifacts that interested him from all around the world, leading to the foundation to describe two types of collections, &quot;Canadiana&quot; and &quot;Harvieana&quot;. After meeting German-American wildlife artist Carl Rungius, Harvie sought to acquire as many of his works as he could, purchasing his entire studio in Banff, and sending employees to New York to purchase any other works they could find, eventually reaching a size of 2,600 works by Rungius. Harvie used his fortune to commission works and bring artists to Alberta from across the world, including John Gilroy and Pilkington Jackson.

=== Creating the Glenbow–Alberta Institute ===

In 1964, with the assistance of the Government of Alberta, the Glenbow Foundation - Alberta Government Museum opened with the foundation supplying the exhibits, personnel and expertise, and the Government of Alberta providing the old Calgary courthouse and maintenance costs. The courthouse was found to be too small for the foundation and the exhibits, so later in 1965 the archives and library portion of the foundation moved to the Calgary Public Library Building.

The next major milestone occurred in 1966, when Harvie, who had been experiencing health issues, donated his collection to the people of Alberta as a centennial gift. The gift was finalized when the Legislative Assembly of Alberta passed &quot;An Act to Establish the Glenbow–Alberta Institute&quot; on April 15, 1966. The new institute was operated with a volunteer board, with one-third of the board appointed by the Government of Alberta, one-third by the Devonian Foundation, and one-third elected by members of the institute. The institute was initially funded by matching $5 million donations from Harvie and the Alberta government. On March 15, 1973, the institute was vested with the responsibility of being the City of Calgary&#x27;s archivists, and all records no longer required in normal civic operations were to be made available and held by the institute.

In 1973, plans were finalized for the Glenbow to construct a new million facility to hold the institute&#x27;s growing collection. The Government of Alberta funded most of the new centre, with the Government of Canada contributing $1.6 million, and the City of Calgary underwrote annual maintenance costs. An eight-story, structure was built by the Government of Alberta across from the Calgary Tower. The building was completed and opened to the public on September 22, 1976.

During the 1980s as the price of oil dropped, the Glenbow Museum came under significant financial pressure. In 1983, the museum noted it had a $400,000 deficit and noted the museum would close in Summer 1983 if it was unable to raising the funds. Since the opening of the new building in 1976, the organization had outspent its annual endowment creating the shortfall, and lower corporate donations with the economic downturn further reduced operating funds. The Government of Alberta provided a one time grant of $150,000 to keep the library and archives open, and Albertans donated over $240,000 within a month, but the total was still short of what was necessary for the continued operation of the museum at the same level of service.

=== Modern history ===

In 2007, a permanent exhibit entitled &quot;Mavericks&quot; opened on the third floor; this exhibit traces the history of Alberta through a series of 48 influential and colourful personalities. As of 2013, the president and CEO is Donna Livingstone, formerly Vice President of Programs and Exhibitions and a member of the board of directors. Former presidents and CEOs include Mike Robinson and Jeff Spalding.

In 2021, the Glenbow Museum secured a total of $94 million from government sources including $40 million from each of the Government of Canada and Alberta, and $14 million from the city of Calgary to redesign and renovate the eight-story downtown space. The museum will seek an additional $40 million from private sources for the renovation. The project is set to total $115 million for capital costs, and remaining funds going towards operational costs and future programs. Construction closed the museum for three years starting on August 29, 2021. It will reopen in 2025, while providing exhibits through satellite sites.

Admission to the museum is free permanently as of February 2022, due to a $25 million donation by the Shaw Family Foundation. $15 million of the donation will be placed in an endowment fund for admissions, and $10 million is earmarked for the new JR Shaw Institute for Canadian Art, named in honor of JR Shaw, founder of Shaw Communications and Corus Entertainment.

==Archives==
The Glenbow archives are one of Canada&#x27;s largest non-governmental repositories and a major research centre for historians, writers, students, genealogists, and the media. They comprise an extremely large collection of archival records of individuals, families, organizations and businesses from Western Canada and includes 3,500 metres of textual records, over a million photographs, 350 hours of film footage, and 1,500 sound recordings. The archives range from the 1870s to the 1990s, documenting the social, political and economic history of Western Canada, particularly Calgary and southern Alberta. Areas of specialty include First Nations, Métis genealogy, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, ranching and agriculture, the petroleum industry, politics, labour, women, and business. Unique collections in the archives include catalogs, cookbooks, records of land sales by the Canadian Pacific Railway, maps, school yearbooks, extensive genealogical resources, and an excellent collection of resources for the study of Métis genealogy.

==Art collection==
The Glenbow&#x27;s art collection comprises 33,000 works, mainly dating from the 19th century to the present, primarily historical, modern, and contemporary work from or pertaining to the northwest of North America. The collection contains a selection of landscape painting, a Canadian prints collection including works from Walter J. Phillips and modernist printmaker Sybil Andrews, First Nations and Inuit Art, American illustration, and wildlife Art. Works from other parts of the world provide a broader national and international frame of reference.
==Library==
The Glenbow&#x27;s library contains 100,000 books, periodicals, newspapers, maps, and pamphlets with relevance to Western Canada, from the time buffalo roamed the plains, to the coming of the railroad and settlement of the West, to political, economic and social events in Alberta today. The collection includes rare illustrated equestrian literature from the 15th century, school books from one-room school houses, and numerous volumes and other material related to the museum&#x27;s collections of military history, ethnology, mineralogy and art.

==Museum==
The museum&#x27;s collection includes artifacts from Western Canada, and various other cultures around the world. In addition, the museum houses a collection of gems and minerals.

===Community History===

The museum&#x27;s Community History collection includes a number of artifacts, exploring the lives of southern Albertans from 1880 to 1970. The collection includes important holdings of Albertan pottery, Western Canadian folk studies, northern explorations, numismatics, pressed glass, and textiles. The museum sorts its Community History collection in the following manner, Community and Ceremonial Life, Daily Life, Ethnic Cultures, Leisure and Play, and Work and Industry.

The collection contains over 100,000 objects originating from many corners of the world, providing insight into the life in Western Canada from the late 19th century to the present day. Included in the Community History collection are artifacts from the Doukhobor and Hutterite communities of Western Canada, and the Calgary Stampede. The museum also holds several items from the search parties for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition.

Several items from this collection are featured in the &quot;Mavericks: An Incorrigible History of Alberta&quot; exhibition. The permanent exhibit tells the history of Alberta through the stories of 48 individuals, or &quot;mavericks&quot;.

===Military and Mounted Police===
The Military and Mounted Police collection includes an extensive collection of artifacts relating to Canadian military history, with an emphasis on southern Alberta. In addition, the museum&#x27;s collection also includes a number of European and Japanese armour, arms, and firearms and other weapons from around the world. The Military and Mounted Police collection has been sorted into the following categories, Arms and Armour, Canada at War, Famous People and Battles, Firearms, and Mounted Police. 

The Arms and Armour portion of the collection features a number of European and Japanese arms and armour. In particular, the museum&#x27;s collection of Japanese armour and arms is the largest collection of its kind in Canada. The collection sorted under Canada at War primarily focuses on the role of Canada, and Alberta, during the North-West Rebellion, World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. The Mounted Police section includes a number of artifacts relating to the development of the North-West Mounted Police, and its successor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The Glenbow&#x27;s military collection is the most diverse in Western Canada, with 26,000 items. This includes 2,100 firearms, ranging from the 16th century to present day, in the Firearms section of the Military and Mounted Police collection. Most of the artifacts from the museum&#x27;s Famous People and Battles section were artifacts acquired from the Royal United Services Institute. In June 2008, the Glenbow Museum and the University of Alberta acquired a number of artifacts from Sam Steele, an officer of the North-West Mounted Police, and the commanding officer of the Strathcona&#x27;s Horse in the Boer War. 60 objects from the Sam Steele collection are on display at the Glenbow Museum.

Many items from the museum&#x27;s Military and Mounted Police collection are on display at the &quot;Warriors: A Global Journey Through Five Centuries&quot; exhibition. The exhibition is a permanent exhibit at the museum which compares cultural approaches to war throughout history.

===Minerals===
The museum&#x27;s Minerals collection includes minerals and precious and semi-precious stones from around the world, particularly Western Canada. The exhibit includes minerals that glow in the dark, a display of fool&#x27;s gold, a piece of the Earth&#x27;s oldest rock, and rock crystals in every colour of the rainbow. Specimens were selected for exhibition value as well as mineralogical significance.

A number of items from the museum&#x27;s Mineral collection may be viewed at the &quot;Treasures of the Mineral World&quot; exhibition, a permanent exhibit at the Glenbow Museum.

===Native North America===

The Native North America collection is a large collection of artifacts from various indigenous peoples of North America, particularly the Plains Indians. The museum sorts its Community History collection in the following manner, Inuit, Métis, Northwest Coast, Plains, and Other First Peoples.

The Plains section places a particular emphasis on the indigenous peoples of the northwestern Plains, including the Anishinaabe, the &quot;Niitsitapi&quot;, Cree, and Tsuut&#x27;ina Nation. The Northwest Coast section of the Native North America collection focuses on the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, most notably the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, and the Nuu-chah-nulth. The Other First Peoples section includes artifacts from other Canadian First Nations groups, including the Dene, Iroqouis, and Mi&#x27;kmaq.

The Glenbow ethnology collection contains approximately 48,000 items. &quot;Niitsitapiisinni: Our Way of Life&quot;, a permanent exhibit centred around the &quot;Niitsitapi&quot;, features a number of items from the museum&#x27;s Native North America collection.

===World Cultures===
The Glenbow Museum&#x27;s collection includes a number of artifacts from around the world. Its collection is sorted into Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. The museum&#x27;s African collection contains over 5,000 artifacts, most of which was acquired in the 1960s. The collection has a particular focus on West Africa, with a number of artifacts from the Akan, Bamileke, Yoruba, and the Kingdom of Bamum. The museum&#x27;s Latin American collection was also acquired in the 1960s. Its collection primarily focuses on the Amazon Basin, with artifacts from the Bororo, Karajá, Tapirapé, and Urubu peoples.

<text>Trans-Lux is a company that specializes in designing, selling, leasing, and maintaining multi-color, real-time data and LED large-screen electronic information displays, but is primarily known as a major supplier of national stock ticker displays for stock exchanges. These indoor and outdoor displays are used worldwide in many industries, including banking, gaming, corporate, retail, healthcare, sports, transportation and in the financial industry.

==Early history==

The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room. To help with this he enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne had the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent screen-material than what was available at that time. 

==Moving light==
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for &quot;light&quot;) Products. Three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk American Lux Products managed to create its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection screens. At that time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes from a glass dome-topped ticker. This information was provided by Western Union&#x27;s telegraph and/or wire service. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board. Although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods, by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first &quot;Movie ticker&quot; ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.

It is this stock ticker that provided the company&#x27;s name: &quot;Trans-Lux&quot; meaning &quot;moving light&quot;. 

Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011, Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country. 

==Moving pictures==

By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. In partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation was created to penetrate the market further. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more legroom, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news &quot;heritage&quot; the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of &quot;shorts&quot; (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company&#x27;s third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.

In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning. Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.

In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company&#x27;s declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949, but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies. 
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.

By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry&#x27;s problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company&#x27;s theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.

In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the &quot;San Francisco Experience&quot;, a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973, opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called &quot;bedazzling and breathtaking&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The New York Experience&quot;, which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history. The show featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale. Escalating rent costs forced its closure in 1989.

By 1981, Trans-Lux&#x27;s theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. 
By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company&#x27;s total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.

==Television==

By 1950, television had become America&#x27;s most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US, with stations in only five cities. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.

Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with &quot;Teleprocess&quot; screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children&#x27;s series: &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot;. The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City. They also produced &quot;Mack and Myer for Hire&quot; at the Hempstead Studios in Long Island City.

In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to &quot;Americanize&quot; the new anime series, &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux&#x27;s film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises continued to syndicate &quot;Speed Racer&quot; to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s. That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut. Starting in the 1990s, all current airings and home media releases of &quot;Speed Racer&quot; no longer use the opening &quot;Trans-Lux television presents&quot; caption.

As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.

==Stock quotes and signage==

In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the &quot;Great White Way&quot; of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.

By the early &#x27;60s, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company&#x27;s fortunes were tied to its old system&#x27;s two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.

In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new -long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition&#x27;s technology, and they needed Trans-Lux&#x27;s knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.

Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.

The Jet&#x27;s popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.

As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker, which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong growing market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.

Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel&#x27;s teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux&#x27;s entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.

==Diversification==

Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full-service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company&#x27;s capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux&#x27;s serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. 
Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.

In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company&#x27;s new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher&#x27;s board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux&#x27; unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds&#x27; installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and has caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5&#x27; x 33.5&#x27; SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24&#x27; x 164&#x27; SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.

Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.

By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux&#x27;s International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries. In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.

==Company divisions==
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:
*Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
*TL Energy, a provider of LED lighting.
*PrismaTronic, a provider of Digital LEDs for the OOH marketplace

==Public documents==
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.

Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010, from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange&#x27;s Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux&#x27;s common stock as of November 17, 2010.

<text>Potassium dichromate, , is a common inorganic chemical reagent, most commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various laboratory and industrial applications. As with all hexavalent chromium compounds, it is acutely and chronically harmful to health. It is a crystalline ionic solid with a very bright, red-orange color. The salt is popular in laboratories because it is not deliquescent, in contrast to the more industrially relevant salt sodium dichromate.
==Chemistry==

===Production===
Potassium dichromate is usually prepared by the reaction of potassium chloride on sodium dichromate. Alternatively, it can be also obtained from potassium chromate by roasting chromite ore with potassium hydroxide. It is soluble in water and in the dissolution process it ionizes:

===Reaction===
Potassium dichromate is an oxidising agent in organic chemistry, and is milder than potassium permanganate. It is used to oxidize alcohols. It converts primary alcohols into aldehydes and, under more forcing conditions, into carboxylic acids. In contrast, potassium permanganate tends to give carboxylic acids as the sole products. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified dichromate. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.

In an aqueous solution the color change exhibited can be used to test for distinguishing aldehydes from ketones. Aldehydes reduce dichromate from the +6 to the +3 oxidation state, changing color from orange to green. This color change arises because the aldehyde can be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. A ketone will show no such change because it cannot be oxidized further, and so the solution will remain orange.

When heated strongly, it decomposes with the evolution of oxygen.
When an alkali is added to an orange-red solution containing dichromate ions, a yellow solution is obtained due to the formation of chromate ions (). For example, potassium chromate is produced industrially using potash:

The reaction is reversible.

Treatment with cold sulfuric acid gives red crystals of chromic anhydride (chromium trioxide, CrO3):

On heating with concentrated acid, oxygen is evolved:
==Uses==
Potassium dichromate has few major applications, as the sodium salt is dominant industrially. The main use is as a precursor to potassium chrome alum, used in leather tanning.

===Cleaning===
Like other chromium(VI) compounds (chromium trioxide, sodium dichromate), potassium dichromate has been used to prepare &quot;chromic acid&quot; for cleaning glassware and etching materials. Because of safety concerns associated with hexavalent chromium, this practice has been largely discontinued.

===Construction===
It is used as an ingredient in cement in which it retards the setting of the mixture and improves its density and texture. This usage commonly causes contact dermatitis in construction workers.

===Photography and printing===
In 1839, Mungo Ponton discovered that paper treated with a solution of potassium dichromate was visibly tanned by exposure to sunlight, the discoloration remaining after the potassium dichromate had been rinsed out. In 1852, Henry Fox Talbot discovered that exposure to ultraviolet light in the presence of potassium dichromate hardened organic colloids such as gelatin and gum arabic, making them less soluble.

These discoveries soon led to the carbon print, gum bichromate, and other photographic printing processes based on differential hardening. Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye. Some processes depended on the hardening only, in combination with the differential absorption of certain dyes by the hardened or unhardened areas. Because some of these processes allowed the use of highly stable dyes and pigments, such as carbon black, prints with an extremely high degree of archival permanence and resistance to fading from prolonged exposure to light could be produced.

Dichromated colloids were also used as photoresists in various industrial applications, most widely in the creation of metal printing plates for use in photomechanical printing processes.

&quot;Chromium intensification&quot; or &quot;Photochromos&quot; uses potassium dichromate together with equal parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted down to approximately 10% v/v to treat weak and thin negatives of black and white photograph roll. This solution reconverts the elemental silver particles in the film to silver chloride. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film can be redeveloped to its end-point yielding a stronger negative which is able to produce a more satisfactory print.

A potassium dichromate solution in sulfuric acid can be used to produce a reversal negative (that is, a positive transparency from a negative film). This is effected by developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silver metal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed silver halide to be reduced to silver metal. The results obtained can be unpredictable, but sometimes excellent results are obtained producing images that would otherwise be unobtainable. This process can be coupled with solarisation so that the end product resembles a negative and is suitable for printing in the normal way.

Cr(VI) compounds have the property of tanning animal proteins when exposed to strong light. This quality is used in photographic screen-printing.

In screen-printing a fine screen of bolting silk or similar material is stretched taut onto a frame similar to the way canvas is prepared before painting. A colloid sensitized with a dichromate is applied evenly to the taut screen. Once the dichromate mixture is dry, a full-size photographic positive is attached securely onto the surface of the screen, and the whole assembly exposed to strong light – times vary from 3 minutes to a half an hour in bright sunlight – hardening the exposed colloid. When the positive is removed, the unexposed mixture on the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.

===Analytical reagent===
Because it is non-hygroscopic, potassium dichromate is a common reagent in classical &quot;wet tests&quot; in analytical chemistry.

====Ethanol determination====
The concentration of ethanol in a sample can be determined by back titration with acidified potassium dichromate. Reacting the sample with an excess of potassium dichromate, all ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid:
Full reaction of converting ethanol to acetic acid:

The excess dichromate is determined by titration against sodium thiosulfate. Adding the amount of excess dichromate from the initial amount, gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the dichromate solution against a blank.

One major application for this reaction is in old police breathalyzer tests. When alcohol vapor makes contact with the orange dichromate-coated crystals, the color changes from Cr(VI) orange to Cr(III) green. The degree of the color change is directly related to the level of alcohol in the suspect&#x27;s breath.

====Silver test====
When dissolved in an approximately 35% nitric acid solution it is called Schwerter&#x27;s solution and is used to test for the presence of various metals, notably for determination of silver purity. Pure silver will turn the solution bright red, sterling silver will turn it dark red, low grade coin silver (0.800 fine) will turn brown (largely due to the presence of copper which turns the solution brown) and even green for 0.500 silver.
Brass turns dark brown, copper turns brown, lead and tin both turn yellow while gold and palladium do not change.

====Sulfur dioxide test====
Potassium dichromate paper can be used to test for sulfur dioxide, as it turns distinctively from orange to green. This is typical of all redox reactions where hexavalent chromium is reduced to trivalent chromium. Therefore, it is not a conclusive test for sulfur dioxide. The final product formed is Cr2(SO4)3.

===Wood treatment===
Potassium dichromate is used to stain certain types of wood by darkening the tannins in the wood. It produces deep, rich browns that cannot be achieved with modern color dyes. It is a particularly effective treatment on mahogany.

==Natural occurrence==

Potassium dichromate occurs naturally as the rare mineral lópezite. It has only been reported as vug fillings in the nitrate deposits of the Atacama Desert of Chile and in the Bushveld igneous complex of South Africa.

==Safety==

In 2005–06, potassium dichromate was the 11th-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (4.8%).

Potassium dichromate is one of the most common causes of chromium dermatitis; chromium is highly likely to induce sensitization leading to dermatitis, especially of the hand and forearms, which is chronic and difficult to treat. Toxicological studies have further illustrated its highly toxic nature. With rabbits and rodents, concentrations as low as 14 mg/kg have shown a 50% fatality rate amongst test groups. Aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable if exposed, and hence responsible disposal according to the local environmental regulations is advised.

As with other Cr(VI) compounds, potassium dichromate is carcinogenic. The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe eye damage or blindness. Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility.

<doc id="1177236" wikidata="Q229672" url="?curid=1177236" title="Voodoo 5">
<text>The Voodoo 5 was the last and most powerful graphics card line that was released by 3dfx Interactive. All members of the family were based upon the VSA-100 graphics processor. Only the single-chip Voodoo 4 4500 and dual-chip Voodoo 5 5500 made it to market.

==Architecture and performance==

The VSA-100 graphics chip is a direct descendant of &quot;Avenger&quot;, more commonly known as Voodoo3. It was built on a 250 nm semiconductor manufacturing process, as with Voodoo3. However, the process was tweaked with a sixth metal layer to allow for better density and speed, and the transistors have a slightly shorter gate length and thinner gate oxide. VSA-100 has a transistor count of roughly 14 million, compared to Voodoo3&#x27;s ~8 million. The chip has a larger texture cache than its predecessors and the data paths are 32 bits wide rather than 16-bit. Rendering calculations are 40 bits wide in VSA-100 but the operands and results are stored as 32-bit.

One of the design goals for the VSA-100 was scalability. The name of the chip is an abbreviation for &quot;Voodoo Scalable Architecture.&quot; By using one or more VSA-100 chips on a board, the various market segments for graphics cards are satisfied with just a single graphics chip design. Theoretically, anywhere from 1 to 32 VSA-100 GPUs could be run in parallel on a single graphics card, and the fillrate of the card would increase proportionally. On cards with more than one VSA-100, the chips are linked using 3dfx&#x27;s Scan-Line Interleave (SLI) technology. A major drawback to this method of performance scaling is that various parts of hardware are needlessly duplicated on the cards and board complexity increases with each additional processor.

3dfx changed the rendering pipeline from one pixel pipeline with twin texture mapping units (Voodoo2/3) to a dual pixel pipeline design with one texture mapping unit on each. This design, commonly referred to as a 2×1 configuration, has an advantage over the prior 1×2 design with the ability to always output 2 pixels and 2 texels per clock instead of 1 pixel and 2 texels per clock.

This is the first 3dfx graphics chip to support full 32-bit color depth in 3D, compared to 16-bit color depth with all previous designs. The limitation of 256px × 256px maximum texture dimensions was also addressed and VSA-100 can use up to 2048px × 2048px textures. Additionally, 3dfx implemented the FXT1 and DXTC texture compression techniques.

The VSA-100 supports a hardware accumulation buffer, known as the &quot;T-buffer&quot;. When rendering to the T-buffer, VSA-100 can store the combined outputs of several frames. This mechanism allows for creation of effects such as motion blur (if used temporally) and anti-aliasing (if used spatially). VSA-100 supports rotated-grid super-sampling anti-aliasing (RGSS AA) modes, with a maximum anti-aliasing level determined by the number of VSA-100 chips in the SLI configuration. One chip allows 2× AA, two chips allows 4× AA, four chips provides for 8× AA and so on. The RGSS method of anti-aliasing combines multiple samples of each frame, resulting in higher quality than the brute force ordered-grid over-sampling of ImgTech PowerVR, ATI Radeon DDR and Nvidia GeForce 2.

The chip implements a 128-bit SDRAM interface, again similar to the Voodoo3. Memory capacity and bandwidth is separately dedicated to each VSA-100 processor. While capacity is not cumulative across the entire card, bandwidth is effectively cumulative and thus a card with 2× VSA-100 processors has similar bandwidth to a single-chip graphics card using 128-bit DDR memory. Memory is clocked synchronously with the VSA-100 chip. Later, unreleased boards were planned to offer a 64-bit DDR memory design instead, in order to reduce board costs through lower complexity, while offering similar RAM performance.

Voodoo 4 and Voodoo 5 support MPEG-2 video acceleration.

While VSA-100 is an AGP 4× capable graphics processor, 3dfx did not implement AGP texturing.

The Voodoo5 did not offer next-generation DirectX 8.0 vertex and pixel shaders that would be found in the GeForce 3 and Radeon 8500, nor even DirectX 7 features such as hardware transform and lighting acceleration for vertices (although T&amp;L could be compensated by a fast CPU). Designed for scalability, it was nonetheless unrealistic for 3dfx to incrementally increase the number of Voodoo5 chips just to keep pace in performance with rival developments. Nvidia would further refine the GeForce 3&#x27;s feature set into the GeForce 4 Ti (NV25) to satisfy multiple market segments (the Ti 4600 at $399 and Ti 4200 at $199), as did ATI which derived the lower-cost Radeon 9000 (RV200) from the Radeon 8500 (R100). 

==Models==

===Voodoo 4 4500===

Released after the Voodoo 5 5500, the Voodoo4 4500 is the budget implementation of the VSA-100 product. It used only one VSA-100 chip and did not need an additional power connection. It was more expensive yet it was beaten in almost all areas by the GeForce2 MX and Radeon SDR.

===Voodoo 5 5000===
The unreleased Voodoo 5 5000 was to be similar to the 5500 but with half of the RAM capacity (32 MB total).

===Voodoo 5 5500===
The Voodoo 5 5500 comes in three flavors: a universal AGP version (AGP 1/2x, prototypes were made with AGP4x-interface) with full sideband support, PCI, and the Mac Edition, which is only available for PCI, though could run in 66 MHz PCI slots. The Mac Edition has dual link DVI-D and VGA-A outputs, the other versions just have one VGA-out.

In games, the Voodoo 5 5500 is able to outperform the Nvidia GeForce 256 and ATI Rage 128 MAXX, but unfortunately Voodoo5 5500 was late to market and was up against the new GeForce 2 GTS and Radeon DDR, both of which easily outperformed the Voodoo 5.

===Voodoo 5 6000===

The Voodoo 5 6000 is the unreleased high-end product in the Voodoo5 line. It was to use four 166 MHz VSA-100 processors, each with its own 32 MB of 166 MHz SDRAM, resulting in the first 128 MB graphics card (consisting of sixteen 8 MB chips). Approximately 1000+ test cards were produced. Because the card used more power than the AGP specification allowed for, a special power supply called &quot;Voodoo Volts&quot; had to be included with it. This would have been an external device that would connect to an AC outlet. Most of the prototype cards utilized a standard internal power supply Molex power connector.

With regards to performance, little was known until enthusiasts were able to get pre-release hardware and run tests on it. The results showed that the Voodoo 5 6000 outperformed the GeForce 2 Ultra and Radeon 7500, which were the fastest iterations of the GeForce 2 (NV15) and Radeon R100 lines, respectively. (It was rumored that GeForce 2 Ultra was intended to prevent 3dfx taking the lead with their Voodoo 5 6000.) In some cases, the 6000 was shown to compete well with the next-generation GeForce 3.

The precarious financial situation of 3dfx was a factor contributing to the 6000&#x27;s demise. But even had 3dfx survived long enough to launch the Voodoo5 6000, the production cost would have likely hampered its competitiveness from a profitability standpoint. Due to being burdened with much redundancy and a complicated board, particularly 128MB of RAM, it was projected to have a US$600 price tag, considerably higher than the single-chip GeForce 3 (which was intended by Nvidia to replace the short-lived GeForce 2 Ultra as its flagship product) and Radeon 8500 (US$299) which achieved similar performance in their debut releases with 64MB (although 128 MB versions were later made available). The Voodoo5 6000&#x27;s omissions would be apparent for its price, since it did not have next-generation DirectX 8.0 vertex and pixel shaders that would be found in the GeForce 3 and Radeon 8500.

There were five revisions of the Voodoo 5 6000: (the numbers after the model state the build week: 10 for week 10, 00 for year 2000).

====Intel Revision 1 (model 1000–1900)====
This was an early alpha of the card primarily used for photos and testing purposes. These cards generally had a short life expectancy, and were largely incompatible with various motherboards at the time. They also typically could not achieve speeds above 143 MHz without suffering from VSA-100 &quot;death&quot;. This revision used an Intel PCI bridge chip, was equipped with 128 MB of 5.4ns SDRAM and used a proprietary external 3dfx power supply. Initial models had the chips mounted in the arrangement seen in the photograph, but this required a PCB with eight circuitry layers (most GeForce 2 cards were four-layer, while the Voodoo 5 5500 was six-layer) and would have been unreasonably expensive. All of the later revisions had the four chips mounted in a row.

====HiNT Revision 2 (model 2000–2900)====
This version dropped the Intel PCI bridge chip in favor of a HiNT bridge chip. These cards were able to be powered by either the internal system PSU or by a proprietary 3dfx external power supply, a feature seen in all subsequent prototype revisions. The clock speed varied from card to card, generally either 166 or 183 MHz. The VSA-100 chips used still did not have a long life expectancy, and may have had problems running anti-aliasing. This revision had 128 MB of 5.0ns SDRAM.

====HiNT Revision 3 (model 3000–3500)====
Cards from this revision varied in stability from dead to fully functional. A lot of problems had been fixed in this revision, but it still had VSA-100 thermal death problems above 183 MHz. These cards either had 166 or 183 MHz VSA-100 GPUs.

====HiNT Revision 4 (3600–3700)====
3dfx decided on 166 MHz due to issues with the 6000 running properly at 183 MHz due to a design flaw with the PCB. Most of the problems seen in earlier revisions were fixed, although there may have been glitches while in anti-aliasing mode on some cards. Most of the known cards are revision A from week 37, 2000.

====HiNT Revision 5 (model 3900)====
Little is known about this series except that this is the final revision. It was meant to be the retail unit, but shortly after the run of 10 were produced, the 6000 series was cancelled.

===List===

* 1 VGA: Whether the card included a built-in VGA subsystem and ran as a standalone graphics card
* 2 Texture mapping units:render output units

==Successor==
The successor to the Voodoo 5 series, codenamed &quot;Rampage&quot;, was already planned and had been in development for years. It was supposed to have a smaller semiconductor device fabrication process, support for DDR SDRAM, 200+ MHz core, and a T&amp;L unit. However, it was early in its development and only approximately twenty working cards were produced before 3dfx went bankrupt, and most assets were purchased by Nvidia in late 2000.

==Competing chipsets==
*ATI Rage 128 MAXX and Radeon
*Nvidia GeForce 256 and GeForce2
*PowerVR Series 3 (Kyro and Kyro II)
*S3 Savage 2000

<doc id="1177237" wikidata="Q3032528" url="?curid=1177237" title="North Dakota Fighting Hawks">
<text>The North Dakota Fighting Hawks (formerly known as the Flickertails and theFighting Sioux) are the athletic teams that represent the University of North Dakota (UND), located in the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The Fighting Hawks compete at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I level as a member of the Summit League. With 17 varsity teams, North Dakota is best known for its Ice Hockey team and American Football team. North Dakota&#x27;s main rivalries are with the North Dakota State Bison and the Minnesota Golden Gophers.

Originally in the Division II North Central Conference, UND began transitioning to NCAA&#x27;s Division I in 2008 with the football program participating in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). North Dakota is a member of the Summit League for most sports, the Missouri Valley Football Conference in football, and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference for men&#x27;s hockey. The Fighting Hawks competed in the Western Athletic Conference in baseball, plus men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, before dropping all three sports. Baseball was dropped after the 2016 season, and the swimming and diving teams were dropped after the 2016–17 season. Women&#x27;s ice hockey competed in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association before also being dropped after the 2016–17 season.

On January 24, 2017, reports stated that North Dakota would leave the Big Sky Conference to join the Summit League in all sports but football beginning in 2019. The school would join the Missouri Valley Football Conference for football in 2020. The rumored changes became official on January 26, when UND, the Summit League, and the MVFC announced the Fighting Hawks&#x27; move to the Summit in 2018 (instead of 2019) and the MVFC at the reported 2020 date. During UND&#x27;s transition to the MVFC, it will continue to play a full Big Sky football schedule due to contractual commitments; while the Fighting Hawks will not be eligible for the Big Sky title, games against them will count in the Big Sky football standings.

== Sports sponsored ==
===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The Fighting Hawks Basketball team has appeared in the Division 1 tournament 1 time. The most famous athlete to come from the program is former NBA coach and basketball player Phil Jackson.

=== Football ===

The men&#x27;s football home games are held in the Alerus Center. The team competes at the FCS Level in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Prior to Joining the Missouri Valley Football Conference, the team competed in the Big Sky Conference.

=== Ice hockey (men&#x27;s) ===

Having won eight national championships, the men&#x27;s hockey team is easily the most recognized of UND teams. A charter member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, the Fighting Hawks play in the $100+ million Ralph Engelstad Arena.

=== Volleyball === 

The North Dakota Fighting Hawks volleyball are members of the NCAA Division I Summit League. The program only includes a women&#x27;s team.

==Athletics hall of fame==
The Letterwinners Hall of Fame recognizes the efforts and achievements of former UND student-athletes, coaches, and other supporters of UND athletics. Inductees are selected by the UND Letterwinners Association and representatives of the UND athletic department. The Hall of Fame induction ceremony, sponsored by the UND Letterwinners Association, is held each fall in conjunction with a football game. The Hall of Fame is located on the upper concourse at the south end of the Ralph Engelstad Arena.

== Nickname ==
UND&#x27;s nickname was originally The Flickertails, but was unofficially changed to &quot;The Sioux&quot; in 1930. UND&#x27;s former athletic logo, revealed in 1999, a Native American figure, was designed by Bennett Brien, a local artist and UND graduate of Ojibwa ethnicity. After more than a decade of controversy, the name and logo were retired in 2012. On November 18, 2015, it was revealed at a press conference held by President Robert Kelley that Fighting Hawks, with 57.24% of the vote, would become the new university nickname.

<doc id="1177238" wikidata="Q44709" url="?curid=1177238" title="Jean-Jacques Goldman">
<text>Jean-Jacques Goldman (; born 11 October 1951) is a French retired singer-songwriter and record producer whose work remains hugely popular in the French-speaking world. Since the death of Johnny Hallyday in 2017, he has been the highest-grossing living French pop rock act. Born in Paris and active in the French music scene from 1975, Goldman had a highly successful solo career in the 1980s. As part of the trio Fredericks Goldman Jones, he scored another string of hits in the 1990s.

A founding member of the Les Enfoirés charity collective in 1986 (with which he remained active until 2016), Goldman also wrote successful albums and songs for many artists, including &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot; for Céline Dion, the most successful French-language recording to date. He received his most notable recognition in the English-speaking world with a 1997 Grammy Award for Album of the Year as co-author of three tracks on Céline Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Falling into You&quot;. Despite his voluntary retirement from popular music in the early 2000s, Goldman remains highly appreciated and influential in France.

== Biography ==
Born in Paris to an immigrant Polish Jewish father, Alter Mojze Goldman (born in Lublin), and a German Jewish mother, Ruth Ambrunn (born in Munich), Jean-Jacques Goldman was the third of four children. As a child, he began his music studies on the violin, then the piano. In 1968, he abandoned classical music studies for American rock and roll and folk music, listening to the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Aretha Franklin, and emphasising the guitar. His sudden conversion to popular music is loosely chronicled in the song &quot;Un, deux, trois&quot;. Meanwhile, Goldman earned a business degree from the École des hautes études commerciales du Nord (EDHEC) in Lille. In 1972, he met Catherine, his first wife, with whom he had three children. Goldman first entered the French music scene as a member of a progressive rock group named Taï Phong (&quot;great wind&quot; or &quot;typhoon&quot; in Vietnamese), which released its first album in 1975. Their first song, a moderate hit, was &quot;Sister Jane&quot;. After three albums in English (on which he sang and played guitar as well as violin), Goldman was determined to write and sing in French, and this led him to leave the band.

Marc Lumbroso saw Goldman&#x27;s potential and managed to sign him a five-album contract with Epic Records. That same year he released his first album, which he wanted to call &quot;Démodé&quot; (&quot;out of fashion&quot;), but the label refused and it was left untitled. (&quot;Démodé&quot; has since become its unofficial title.) From the album, &quot;Il suffira d&#x27;un signe&quot; was Goldman&#x27;s first song to become a significant success. In 1982, he released a second album with no title; this time the intended one was &quot;Minoritaire&quot;, which was also rejected as it was deemed not commercial enough. (It has likewise become the album&#x27;s unofficial title.) The recording includes several hit singles: &quot;Quand la musique est bonne&quot;, &quot;Comme toi&quot; (inspired by a picture of a young Jewish girl who died in a concentration camp, although the heartfelt lyrics never reveal a specific historical context), and &quot;Au bout de mes rêves&quot;. This became Goldman&#x27;s breakthrough album, with about 900,000 copies sold. His third album, released in 1984, was his first with an official title, &quot;Positif&quot;. The name was the singer&#x27;s ironic response to the refusal of his previous two titles and spawned new hits such as &quot;Encore un matin&quot; and &quot;Envole-moi&quot;. It performed even better, with some 1 million units sold. Goldman&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Non homologué&quot; (&quot;not approved&quot;, continuing a trend of ironic and self-deprecating titles), garnered the hit songs &quot;Je marche seul&quot;, &#x27;Je te donne&quot; (a bilingual rock duet, with Michael Jones singing the English verses and Goldman the French ones) and &quot;Pas toi&quot;. He recorded a double album in 1987, &quot;Entre gris clair et gris foncé&quot; (&quot;Between light grey and dark grey&quot;), which launched a string of hits: &quot;Elle a fait un bébé toute seule&quot;, &quot;Puisque tu pars&quot;, &quot;Là-bas&quot; (a duet with Sirima), and &quot;Il changeait la vie&quot;. It became a major success, with more than 2 million units sold.

Yet most critics were harsh, deriding Goldman&#x27;s high-pitched voice as well as his style and demeanour (described as too tame and innocuous) in a collection of softer songs presumably marketed to teenage girls. In reaction, at the end of 1985 Goldman purchased a full-page rebuttal in two major newspapers (&quot;Libération&quot; and &quot;France Soir&quot;) in which he displayed excerpts from his harshest reviews. He also appended an ironic message for his fans, once again demonstrating his taste for unassuming self-promotion: &quot;Thanks for coming anyway...&quot; (&quot;Merci d&#x27;être venus quand même...&quot;).

From 1990 to 1995, Goldman went on to perform in a musical trio called Fredericks Goldman Jones with Carole Fredericks (an American singer and chorist who had moved to France in the 1970s, the sister of Taj Mahal) and Michael Jones (a Welsh guitarist and singer who had settled in his mother&#x27;s native France and whom Goldman met through Taï Phong). Jones joined the band after Goldman decided to stop touring, and the trio had their first breakout hit in 1985 with &quot;Je te donne&quot;. Together they recorded two studio albums, &quot;Fredericks / Goldman / Jones&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Rouge&quot; in 1993 (inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the USSR. The title song features the Red Army Choir), one live album, &quot;Du New Morning au Zénith&quot;, and the trio also released several successful singles: &quot;&quot;Nuit&quot;&quot;, &quot;À nos actes manqués&quot;, &quot;Né en 17 à Leidenstadt&quot; (another song about war and how it affects people&#x27;s lives), &quot;Juste après&quot; (inspired by a TV documentary about the work of Médecins Sans Frontières in Congo that showed a missionary sister&#x27;s harrowing struggle to save a newborn&#x27;s life), and &quot;Tu manques&quot;. Several of these songs were later rerecorded in English, but they did not find much success in the United Kingdom or the United States.

From 1997 to 2003 he returned to performing as a solo act, releasing two albums, &quot;En passant&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Chansons pour les pieds&quot; in 2001, as well as two live albums, &quot;Tournée 98 En passant&quot; and &quot;Un tour ensemble&quot;, with new hit songs like &quot;On ira&quot;, &quot;Quand tu danses&quot;, &quot;Sache que je&quot;, &quot;Bonne idée&quot;, &quot;Tournent les violons&quot;, &quot;Ensemble&quot;, &quot;Les choses&quot;, &quot;Et l&#x27;on n&#x27;y peut rien&quot;. After a last concert in 2004, he suddenly stopped performing and recording, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Goldman had remarried in 2001 to Nathalie Thu Hong-Lagier, a young fan who was then studying mathematics and who would later earn her PhD in pure mathematics. In 2011, to shut down rumours about a possible musical comeback, he published a short text denying any plans for a new album or tour in the foreseeable future. Since then, Goldman has remained elusive and largely absent from the French media. He continued to compose and produce a few songs for other artists, however, sometimes lending his voice to musical collaborations with others. For example, he recorded &quot;4 Mots sur un piano&quot; with Patrick Fiori and Christine Ricol in 2007; it became a significant hit.

Goldman also had a prominent role in French charity acts from the middle of the 1980s, when in 1985 the noted French comedian Coluche asked him to write a song to promote an initiative that Coluche had just created, Les restos du cœur. These were a group of soup kitchens and food pantries intended to provide free meals and food packages to poor people during the hard winter months. Goldman crafted and produced the eponymous song (reportedly composed in three days), then with Coluche brought in other French celebrities (actors Yves Montand, Catherine Deneuve and Nathalie Baye, soccer player Michel Platini, TV host Michel Drucker) to perform it as an extended troupe. It would be somewhat akin to &quot;We Are the World&quot;, the internationally known US musical initiative that same year. For the French project, each celebrity would recite a verse, as none of them were trained singers. It was called Les Enfoirés, originally a very crude and offensive term literally translatable as &quot;covered in diarrhea&quot; but whose colloquial meaning is &quot;the bastards&quot;, &quot;the assholes&quot;, or (a gimmick Coluche used in his shows) in its more casual sense, &quot;motherfucker&quot;. After Coluche&#x27;s death in 1986, Goldman took over and became the main organizer of the annual charity concert and record. It was a role he filled until 2016, when he decided to quit after a song he wrote for that year&#x27;s charity album, &quot;Toute la vie&quot;, sparked controversy. Some of the song&#x27;s lyrics were deemed &quot;reactionary&quot;, with Goldman being accused of an unfair portrayal of current youth and a desire to create a pointless opposition between young and old generations.

Throughout his career, Goldman has frequently composed for other singers (sometimes using pseudonyms), most notably Johnny Hallyday (the whole &quot;Gang&quot; album in 1985, among his most successful) and Céline Dion. He wrote and produced two whole albums for her: &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot; in 1995 (released in the US as &quot;The French Album&quot;), which is still the best-selling French album in history with 10 million copies sold worldwide, and &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot; in 1998. He also worked with Dion on the album &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot; along with Gildas Arzel, Jacques Veneruso and Erick Benzi. The songs &quot;If That&#x27;s What It Takes&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot; from her album &quot;Falling into You&quot; are English-language adaptations of songs Goldman wrote for Céline. Also, her song &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; from the album of the same name is an English adaptation of Goldman&#x27;s 1987 solo song &quot;Puisque tu pars&quot;. He has also collaborated with Patricia Kaas, Garou, Marc Lavoine, Gérald De Palmas, Patrick Fiori, Khaled (&quot;Aïcha&quot;), Lorie and Florent Pagny, as well as jazzman Chet Baker, Supertramp&#x27;s saxophonist John Helliwell, Joe Cocker (&quot;On my way home&quot; from the album &quot;No Ordinary World&quot; is an adaptation from &quot;Là-bas&quot;), &quot;king of soul&quot; Ray Charles and American songwriter Diane Warren.

On 19 November 2012, &quot;Génération Goldman&quot;, a tribute album to Goldman, was released on the MyMajorCompany France and M6 Music labels, with a number of artists interpreting Goldman&#x27;s songs. A second volume followed in 2013.

In December 2023, Goldman&#x27;s song &quot;Pense à nous&quot; premiered on cellist Gautier Capuçon&#x27;s album &quot;Destination Paris&quot;. It was sung by children&#x27;s choirs of the Orchestre à l’École Association and the Maîtrise de Radio France de Paris and Bondy.

===Personal life===
From 1975 to 1997, Goldman was married to Catherine Morlet, a psychologist. In 2001, he married Nathalie Thu Hong-Lagier, a mathematician. He is the father of six: Caroline (b. 1975), Michaël (b. 1979) and Nina (b. 1985) with Morlet, and Maya (b. 2004), Kimi (b. 2005) and Rose (b. 2007) with Thu Hong-Lagier. 

His son Michael Goldman is one of the co-founders of My Major Company France, a major fan-funded music label. 

His younger brother Robert Goldman is also a songwriter (often known as J. Kapler).

His half-brother Pierre Goldman, a left-wing intellectual and convicted robber later acquitted by a French court, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in Paris in 1979.

<text>Frank Duncan Graham (1875–1965) was a prolific and eloquent writer of Audel&#x27;s guides. Graham seemed to specialize in subjects related to steam engines and other types of engines.

== Early life ==
He was born Aug. 16, 1875 at Talledega Springs, Ala., the family seat, and later moved to Montgomery.

Graham was a graduate of Princeton University, with a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering and a licensed marine and stationary engineer with the Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey. After graduating with a B.S. degree, Frank continued his studies in steam engineering at Stevens Institute where he graduated in 1902. He secured his M.S. degree at Princeton in 1903. .

His musical background was responsible for an early start on his career as a musician. Among his several teachers he was especially impressed with organist and choirmaster, Bruno Oscar Klein of St. Xavier Church, New York City. The class ode played by a band at commencement was one of his compositions

== Career ==
Graham&#x27;s more epic works include his eight-volume &quot;Audel&#x27;s Engineers and Mechanics Guide&quot;, 1921, which covered subjects as diverse as flying &quot;aeroplanes&quot;, steam engines, and house wiring. The 12 volume &quot;Audel&#x27;s New Electric Library&quot;, 1929, covered practically all that was known about electricity.

Other Audel books by Graham include: &quot;Audel&#x27;s Handy Book of Practical Electricity&quot;, &quot;Audel&#x27;s Power Plant Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;Audel&#x27;s House Heating Guide&quot;, and &quot;Audel&#x27;s Machinists &amp; Tool Makers Handy Book&quot;.

Graham&#x27;s residence was near Sea Bright, New Jersey, on a farm sometimes referred to in his works as &quot;Stornoway&quot;. Graham built two steam powered yachts as demonstrators of his theories on steam plant construction and management, the &quot;Stornoway&quot; and &quot;Stornoway II&quot;. It is not known whether either of these vessels survive.

During his career as organist and choirmaster in several churches, one incident stands out in his recollections. He had applied for a try-out for the position as organist in the First Presbyterian Church, Morristown, N.J. When he arrived found a large audience instead of only members of the Music Committee. A notice in a local newspaper stating that Frank would present a recital was responsible. With characteristic energy and confidence, he gave a full program, including Bach&#x27;s G Minor Mass, all from memory.

His list of compositions is extensive, consisting of songs, as well as piano, violin, and organ pieces. His anthems were published by Oliver Ditson, and were popular in many churches. While playing in the Sea Bright Presbyterian Chapel, he composed a setting for the hymn &#x27;The Shadows of the Evening Hour&#x27; at the request of Janetta McCook, a niece of Charles Alexander, donor of Princeton&#x27;s Alexander Hall.

He felt that his masterpiece was a symphonic tone poem scored for orchestra, organ, harp, and chorus, called &#x27;Meditations after Lamartine.&#x27; Following the death of his first wife, Myrtle Wetmore Stumm, he married Louise Fuetterer on Oct. 12, 1935.

== Legacy ==
Princeton Alumni Weekly Volume 66, number 22 (April 19, 1966) page 17: &quot;MEMORIALS—FRANK DUNCAN GRAHAM &#x27;99—One of our truly southern members, Frank Graham, died on Nov. 24, 1965 in Long Branch, N.J. 

Frank&#x27;s engineering courses were the inspiration for 50 or more books used in many institutions. Recognition for these original works, earned a degree, Doctor of Thermatics and Hydraulics from the Montgomery Alabama State Chamber of Commerce. 

One of his favorite accomplishments was the discovery of a mistake in the calculation of the external latent heat-evaporation in the steam table. His chief peeve was literary thieves using his published material without his permission or crediting him.

<text>In 17th-century European theology, the Court of Conscience described the theory that, after death, one&#x27;s conscience would testify for or against one&#x27;s actions.

During life, the faculty of conscience was believed to be like, but not the same as, the voice of God. It was thought to draw on divine knowledge and precepts, and apply these laws in order to direct the individual toward right action and warn against wrong action.

Theologians speculated that, after death, the conscience functioned as a record, speaking to a divine tribunal which sat in judgement over each individual. Even a conscience which seemed inactive in life was supposed to awaken and provide a perfect account to the tribunal.

The court of conscience was believed to be governed by natural and divine law.

<doc id="1177245" wikidata="Q7108757" url="?curid=1177245" title="Otis Adelbert Kline">
<text>Otis Adelbert Kline (July 1, 1891 – October 24, 1946) was an American songwriter, adventure novelist and literary agent during the pulp era. Much of his work first appeared in the magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Kline was an amateur orientalist and a student of Arabic, like his friend and sometime collaborator, E. Hoffmann Price.

==Kline and Burroughs==
Kline is best known for an apocryphal literary feud with fellow author Edgar Rice Burroughs, in which he supposedly raised the latter&#x27;s ire by producing close imitations (&quot;The Planet of Peril&quot; (1929) and two sequels) of Burroughs&#x27;s Martian novels, though set on Venus; Burroughs, the story goes, then retaliated by writing his own Venus novels, whereupon Kline responded with an even more direct intrusion on Burroughs&#x27;s territory by boldly setting two novels on Mars. Kline&#x27;s jungle adventure stories, reminiscent of Burroughs&#x27;s Tarzan tales, have also been cited as evidence of the conflict. While the two authors did write the works in question, the theory that they did so in contention with each other is supported only circumstantially, by the resemblance and publication dates of the works themselves. The feud theory was originally set forth in a fan press article, &quot;The Kline-Burroughs War,&quot; by Donald A. Wollheim (&quot;Science Fiction News&quot;, November, 1936), and afterward given wider circulation by Sam Moskowitz in his book &quot;Explorers of the Infinite&quot; (1963). Richard A. Lupoff debunked the case in his book &quot;Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure&quot; (1965). Among the evidence cited by Lupoff discounting the feud: (1) no comment from either writer acknowledging the feud is documented, and (2) family members of the two authors have no recollection of ever hearing them mention it. In response to Lupoff&#x27;s investigations, Moskowitz identified his original source as Wollheim&#x27;s article, while Wollheim stated, when questioned on the source of his own information: &quot;I made it up!&quot;

==Kline and &quot;Weird Tales&quot;==

Kline was an assistant editor at &quot;Weird Tales&quot; from its inception. He contributed numerous stories to the magazine and edited a single issue — that for May–July 1924 (which also contained his short story &quot;The Malignant Entity&quot;).

==Literary agent==
In the mid-1930s Kline largely abandoned writing to concentrate on his career as a literary agent (most famously for fellow &quot;Weird Tales&quot; author Robert E. Howard, pioneer sword and sorcery writer and creator of Conan the Barbarian). Kline represented Howard from the spring of 1933 till Howard&#x27;s death in June 1936, and continued to act as literary agent for Howard&#x27;s estate thereafter. It has been suggested that Kline may have completed Howard&#x27;s &quot;planetary romance&quot; &quot;Almuric&quot;, which he submitted to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; for posthumous publication in 1939, although this claim is disputed.

==Bibliography==
Kline&#x27;s novels normally received serial publication in magazines before their release in book form. The Mars novels appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot;, and &quot;The Port of Peril&quot; in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (as &quot;Buccaneers of Venus&quot;).

<text>Violet Constance Jessop (2 October 1887 – 5 May 1971) was an Irish-Argentine ocean liner stewardess and Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse in the early 20th century. Jessop is best known for having survived the sinking of both RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912 and her sister ship in 1916, as well as having been aboard the eldest of the three sister ships, , when it collided with the British warship in 1911.

==Early life==
Born on 2 October 1887, near Bahía Blanca, Argentina, Violet Constance Jessop was the eldest daughter of Irish immigrants William and Katherine Jessop. She was the first of nine children, six of whom survived. Jessop spent much of her childhood caring for her younger siblings. She became very ill as a child with what is presumed to have been tuberculosis, which she survived contrary to doctors&#x27; predictions that her illness would be fatal. When Jessop was 16 years old, her father died of complications from surgery and her family moved to England, where she attended a convent school and cared for her youngest sister while her mother was at sea working as a stewardess. When her mother became ill, Jessop left school and, following in her mother&#x27;s footsteps, applied to be a stewardess. Jessop had to dress down to make herself less attractive to be hired. At age 21, her first stewardess position was with Royal Mail Line aboard &quot;Orinoco&quot; in 1908.

==RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;==
In 1911, Jessop began working as a stewardess for the White Star liner RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;. &quot;Olympic&quot; was a luxury ship that was the largest civilian liner at that time. Jessop was aboard on 20 September 1911, when &quot;Olympic&quot; left from Southampton and collided with the British warship . There were no fatalities and, despite damage, the ship returned to port unaided. Jessop did not discuss this collision in her memoirs. She continued to work on &quot;Olympic&quot; until April 1912, when she was transferred to its sister ship &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;==
Jessop boarded &quot;Titanic&quot; as a stewardess on 10 April 1912, at age 24. Four days later, on 14 April, it struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sank about two hours and forty minutes after the collision. Jessop described in her memoirs how she was ordered up on deck to serve as an example of how to behave for the non-English speakers who could not follow the instructions given to them. She watched as the crew loaded the lifeboats. She was later ordered into lifeboat 16, and as the boat was being lowered, &quot;Titanic&quot;″s sixth officer, James Paul Moody, gave her a baby to look after. The next morning, Jessop and the rest of the survivors were rescued by the and taken to New York City on 18 April. According to Jessop, while aboard &quot;Carpathia&quot;, a woman, presumably the baby&#x27;s mother, grabbed the baby she was holding and ran off crying, without saying a word. After arriving in New York City, she later returned to Southampton.

==HMHS &quot;Britannic&quot;==
In the First World War, Jessop was a stewardess with nursing duties for the British Red Cross. On the morning of 21 November 1916 she was aboard the hospital ship &quot;Britannic&quot;, the younger sister ship of &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, when it sank in the Aegean Sea after detonating a German naval mine. &quot;Britannic&quot; sank within 55 minutes, killing 30 of the 1,066 people aboard.

While &quot;Britannic&quot; was sinking, Jessop and other passengers were nearly killed by the ship&#x27;s propellers that were shredding lifeboats that collided with them. Jessop had to jump out of her lifeboat, resulting in a traumatic head injury which she survived. In her memoirs, she described the scene she witnessed as &quot;Britannic&quot; went under: &quot;The white pride of the ocean&#x27;s medical world ... dipped her head a little, then a little lower and still lower. All the deck machinery fell into the sea like a child&#x27;s toys. Then she took a fearful plunge, her stern rearing hundreds of feet into the air until with a final roar, she disappeared into the depths.&quot; Two other &quot;Titanic&quot; survivors, Arthur John Priest and Archie Jewell, were also aboard and both survived.

==Later life==

Jessop returned to work for White Star Line in 1920, before joining Red Star Line and then Royal Mail Line again. In her time with Red Star, Jessop went on two cruises around the World on the company&#x27;s flagship, . When Jessop was 36, she married John James Lewis, a fellow White Star Line steward. Lewis had served aboard &quot;Olympic&quot; and . They divorced around a year later. In 1950, she retired to Great Ashfield, Suffolk.

Years after her retirement, Jessop claimed to have received a telephone call, on a stormy night, from a woman who asked Jessop if she had saved a baby on the night that &quot;Titanic&quot; sank. &quot;Yes,&quot; Jessop replied. The voice then said &quot;I was that baby,&quot; laughed, and hung up. Her friend and biographer John Maxtone-Graham said it was most likely some children in the village playing a joke on her. She replied, &quot;No, John, I had never told that story to anyone before I told you now.&quot; Records indicate that the only baby on lifeboat 16 was As&#x27;ad Tannūs, also known as Assad Thomas, who was handed to Edwina Troutt, and later reunited with his mother on &quot;Carpathia&quot;. However, Tannūs died on 12 June 1931, so he could not have &#x27;phoned Jessop two decades later. But reports also failed to mention Milvina Dean, who was a two-month-old baby during the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; so she also could have been the one who made the call.

Jessop died of congestive heart failure in 1971 at the age of 83.

==In popular culture==
In the 1958 film &quot;A Night To Remember&quot;, a scene depicts naval architect Thomas Andrews (played by Michael Goodliffe) instructing a stewardess to be seen wearing her life jacket as an example to the other passengers. Several scenes from this film inspired later depictions of the sinking; in James Cameron&#x27;s later 1997 blockbuster &quot;Titanic&quot;, a similar encounter takes place involving Andrews and a stewardess named Lucy, who is also told to wear her life jacket in order to convince the passengers to do the same.

In the 1979 television movie &quot;S.O.S. Titanic&quot;, she was portrayed as an elderly stewardess played by Madge Ryan.

In the 2000 television movie &quot;Britannic&quot;, the main character is Vera Campbell (played by Amanda Ryan), a woman who is apprehensive about travelling on &quot;Britannic&quot; because she had survived the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; four years earlier.

In 2006, &quot;Shadow Divers&quot; John Chatterton and Richie Kohler led an expedition to dive HMHS &quot;Britannic.&quot; The dive team needed to accomplish a number of tasks including reviewing the expansion joints. The team was looking for evidence that would change the thinking on RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;″s sinking. During the expedition, Rosemary E. Lunn played the role of Violet Jessop, re-enacting her jumping into the water, from her lifeboat which was being drawn into &quot;Britannic&quot;″s still turning propellers.

The character of Jessop is featured in the Chris Burgess stage play &quot;Iceberg – Right Ahead!&quot;, staged for the first time Upstairs at the Gatehouse in Highgate, March 2012, to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot;. Jessop&#x27;s role was played by Amy-Joyce Hastings.

Jessop is a secondary character in the 2020 historical horror novel &quot;The Deep&quot; by Alma Katsu. The fictional main character meets Jessop while working aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;; offers her a job; and later works with her aboard &quot;Britannic&quot;.

<doc id="1177252" wikidata="Q635879" url="?curid=1177252" title="World Tourism Day">
<text>Since 1980, the United Nations World Tourism Organization has celebrated World Tourism Day as international observances on September 27. This date was chosen as on that day in 1970, the Statutes of the UNWTO were adopted. The adoption of these Statutes is considered a milestone in global tourism. The purpose of this day is to raise awareness on the role of tourism within the international community and to demonstrate how it affects social, cultural, political and economic values worldwide. 

At its Twelfth Session in Istanbul, Turkey, in October 1997, the UNWTO General Assembly decided to designate a host country each year to act as the Organization&#x27;s partner in the celebration of World Tourism Day. At its Fifteenth Session in Beijing, China, in October 2003, the Assembly decided the following geographic order to be followed for World Tourism Day celebrations: 2006 in Europe; 2007 in South Asia; 2008 in the Americas; 2009 in Africa and 2011 in the Middle East.

The late Ignatius Amaduwa Atigbi, a Nigerian national, was the one who proposed the idea of marking September 27 of every year as World Tourism Day. He was finally recognized for his contribution in 2009. The colour of World Tourism Day is Blue.

World Tourism Day&#x27;s primary objective is to highlight the significance of tourism on a global scale. Apart from the economic impact that tourism brings to a country, it also plays a role in influencing the social, political and cultural environment of the countries.

The primary objective of World Tourism Day is to underscore the importance of tourism on a global scale. Beyond its economic impact, tourism significantly influences the social, political, and cultural fabric of countries and regions. By celebrating this day, nations seek to emphasise that tourism is not just about revenue; it is also about fostering connections, understanding diverse cultures and promoting sustainable practices.

<doc id="1177256" wikidata="Q1451786" url="?curid=1177256" title="A Bag of Marbles">
<text>A Bag of Marbles () is a Second World War autobiographical novel by the French Jewish author Joseph Joffo. It tells the story of his flight, as a small boy, with his brother Maurice to escape from Nazi occupied France to the Zone Libre. Joffo was refused by many publishers before being encouraged by the newly founded publishing house Éditions Jean-Claude Lattès to get the help of an editor to publish the text. The book was a phenomenal best-seller, being made into a major film two years later.

==Plot summary==
Joseph is an ordinary boy with ordinary interests; he dislikes lessons and enjoys playing marbles with his friends. But in 1941, when Paris is occupied by the Nazis, his childhood comes to an end. Never before having known what it means to be a Jew, Joseph is forced to wear a yellow star. Due to his schoolmate&#x27;s admiration of the yellow star, he makes his first business transaction with Zérati, a friend from school: his yellow star exchanged for a bag of marbles.

The racism which results from the occupation leaves only one possibility to Joseph and his brother Maurice: they must flee. Their father, who owns a hairdressing salon, advises them what to do when they leave. Despite having been driven from their home because of their Jewish identity, they are told they must never let anyone know that they are Jews.

They are attempting to escape from the grasp of Hitler and his S.S. men as they infiltrate France. They travel through northern France to the de-militiarised zone in the South. They cross the Demarcation Line in the dead of night with the help of another young boy called Raymond. Once into safe France they travel down to Menton via Marseille, where they spend a fantastic day taking in the sea - something they have never seen before. The boys then spend four blissfully safe months in Menton with their brothers, Henri and Albert, before having to leave the town for Nice, where their parents are waiting.

The boys spend the summer in Nice with their parents. But due to the surrender of the Italians, when they removed Mussolini in favor of Pietro Badoglio, and the arrival of the Germans in safe France, they have to flee quickly to &quot;Moisson Nouvelle&quot;, a camp for boys run by the Vichy government. The boys are safe here for a while, and make many friends, until one day when they accompany the lorry driver Ferdinand into Nice where he leads them, unintentionally, straight into a Nazi trap. They are taken to the &quot;Hotel Excelsior&quot;, the Nazi headquarters in the region. Fortunately, due to their carefully thought up lies and the persistence of a priest, they escape a month later, still alive but pretty rattled. Sadly, they soon learn of the arrest of their father, who had his papers with him at the time, which means it is no longer safe for the two youngsters to remain in Nice.

As the autumn turns to winter, Joseph and Maurice travel north to see their sister, where they learn that it is unsafe for them to stay; so they go to join their brothers in the Alpine resort of Aix-les-Bains. Here Maurice spends the rest of the war working in a bakery, and Joseph works for the owner of the village bookshop - a staunch Petainist. The two brothers also brush up with resistance fighters in the area, when Joseph has to pass on a secret message.

Joseph returns to Paris shortly after peace is announced, in an over-crowded train. Maurice returns by road, although in his typical style he also takes enough cheese to make a very large profit on! They are both re-united with their family in the salonalthough sadly not their father, who was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp before the end of the war.

==Films and graphic novel==
A 1975 film adaptation of the novel was directed by Jacques Doillon. This was followed by a 2017 film adaptation directed by Christian Duguay. A 2012 graphic novel adaptation by Kris and Vincent Bailly was nominated in the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards as Best Reality-Based Work.

<text>Jacob (or Jakob or James or Jacques) Sturm von Sturmeck (10 August 1489 – 30 October 1553) was a German statesman, one of the preeminent promoters of the Protestant Reformation in Germany.

==Biography==
Sturm was born at Strasbourg, where his father, Martin Sturm, was a person of some importance.

He was educated at the universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg, and about 1517 he entered the service of Henry, provost of Strasbourg (d. 1555), a member of the Wittelsbach family. He soon became an adherent of the reformed doctrines, and leaving the service of the provost became a member of the governing body of his native city in 1524.

He was responsible for the policy of Strasbourg during the German Peasants&#x27; War; represented the city at the Diet of Speyer in 1526; and at subsequent Diets gained fame by his ardent championship of its interests. As an advocate of union among the Protestants he took part in the conference at Marburg in 1529; but when the attempts to close the breach between Lutherans and Zwinglians failed, he presented the &quot;Confessio tetrapolitana&quot;, a Zwinglian document, to the Augsburg Diet of 1530. As the representative of Strasbourg Sturm signed the protest which was presented to the Diet of Speyer in 1529, being thus one of the original Protestants. He was on friendly terms with Philip, landgrave of Hesse.

Owing largely to his influence, Strasbourg joined the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. The troops of Strasbourg took the field when the league attacked Charles V in 1546; but in February 1547 the citizens were compelled to submit, when Sturm succeeded in securing very favourable terms from the emperor. He was also able to obtain for his native city some modification of the Interim issued from Augsburg in May 1548. Sturm is said to have been in the pay of Francis I of France, but this seems very unlikely. He founded the Bibliothek in Strasbourg, where he died.

<text>In the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations, ships are identified by pennant number (an internationalisation of &quot;pendant number&quot;, which it was called before 1948). Historically, naval ships flew a flag that identified a flotilla or type of vessel. For example, the Royal Navy used a red burgee for torpedo boats and a pennant with an H for torpedo boat destroyers. Adding a number to the type-identifying flag uniquely identified each ship.

In the current system, a letter prefix, called a &quot;flag superior&quot;, identifies the type of ship, and numerical suffix, called a flag inferior, uniquely identifies an individual ship. Not all pennant numbers have a flag superior.

==Royal Navy systems==
The Royal Navy first used pennants to distinguish its ships in 1661 with a proclamation that all of his majesty&#x27;s ships must fly a union pennant. This distinction was further strengthened by a proclamation in 1674 which forbade merchant vessels from flying any pennants.

The system of numbering pennants was adopted prior to the First World War to distinguish between ships with the same or similar names, to reduce the size and improve the security of communications, and to assist recognition when ships of the same class are together.

During the First World War, pennant numbers were changed on a regular basis, with only those for ships in Home waters centrally controlled; those on foreign stations were allocated on a local basis. However, in November 1919 a new navy-wide system was introduced, with the intention that ships should now carry a permanent number. In most cases, plain numbers were given to capital ships and cruisers, and ones with flags-superior to smaller ships. While the numbers allocated to major warships (except for a few older vessels) would generally remain stable into the 1930s, destroyers were subject to further revisions, stability being reached in January 1922. While 1919/1922 numbers were allocated on a fairly systematic basis, later allocations were on the basis of re-allocating numbers made available by the disposal of older vessels. The next major revision took place in the late 1930s, when the volume of new construction was such that insufficient &#x27;spare&#x27; numbers were now available for new ships. Accordingly, older cruisers had the flag-superior &#x27;I&#x27; added in front of their existing plain numbers; as a result, submarines, which had previously used &#x27;I&#x27;, were given a new scheme of flags-inferior. Other changes were also made at this time. The next major change took place in 1940, when there was a wholesale set of changes to flags-superior, including the old cruisers changing from &#x27;I&#x27; to &#x27;D&#x27;.

Traditionally, a pennant number was reported with a full stop &quot;.&quot; between the flag superior or inferior and the number, although this practice has gradually been dropped, and inter-war photos after about 1924 tend not to have the full stop painted on the hull. The system was used throughout the navies of the British Empire so that a ship could be transferred from one navy to another without changing its pennant number.

Pennant numbers were originally allocated by individual naval stations and when a ship changed station it would be allocated a new number. The Admiralty took the situation in hand and first compiled a &quot;Naval Pendant List&quot; in 1910, with ships grouped under the distinguishing flag of their type. In addition, ships of the 2nd and 3rd (i.e. reserve) fleets had a second flag superior distinguishing from which naval depot they were crewed: &quot;C&quot; for Chatham, &quot;D&quot; for Devonport, &quot;N&quot; for Nore and &quot;P&quot; for Portsmouth.

A completely new system was adopted in 1948, when flags-superior specific to a type of ship were introduced. For example, cruisers had the flag-superior &#x27;C&#x27;, destroyers &#x27;D&#x27;, frigates &#x27;F&#x27; and carriers &#x27;R&#x27;. In general, the existing numerical part of a ship&#x27;s number was kept, except where this would lead to duplication (especially in the case of frigates, where &#x27;F&#x27; now absorbed the former &#x27;K&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27; lists), in which case the number was increased by 100, 200 or 300, as necessary.

The 1948 system was later taken over by NATO, and a single pennant list set up for all NATO navies, apart from the US and Canada.

During the 1970s, the service stopped painting pennant numbers on submarines on the grounds that, with the arrival of nuclear boats, they spent too little time on the surface, although submarines do continue to be issued numbers.

 was initially allocated the pennant number F232, until it was realised that in the Royal Navy, form number 232 is the official report for ships that have run aground; sailors being superstitious, it was quickly changed to F229.

===Second World War=== 
====No flag superior====
Pendant number 13 was not allocated.
* Capital ships, aircraft carriers, modern cruisers

====Flags superior====
Pendant numbers 13 were not allocated to flag superiors. The letters J and K were used with three number combinations due to the number of vessels.
* D — destroyers (until 1940), older capital ships, aircraft carriers, cruisers (from 1940)
* F — destroyers (until 1940) and large auxiliary combatants (from 1940)
* G — destroyers (from 1940)
* H — destroyers
* I — aircraft carriers, cruisers (until 1940), destroyers (from 1940)
* J — minesweepers
* K — corvettes, frigates
* L — escort destroyers, sloops (until 1941)
* M — minelayers
* N — minesweepers
* P — sloops (until 1939), boom defence vessels (until 1940)
* R — destroyers (from 1942), sloops
* T — river gunboats, netlayers
* U — sloops (from 1941)
* W — tugs and salvage vessels
* X — special service vessels
* Z — gate, mooring and boom defence vessels
* 4 — auxiliary anti-aircraft vessels
* FY — fisheries (auxiliary fishing trawlers, drifter etc.)

====Flags inferior====
Flags inferior were applied to submarines. Royal Navy submarines of the &quot;H&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, and some transferred American vessels, were not issued names, only numbers. In these cases, the pendant number was simply the hull number inverted (i.e. &quot;L24&quot; was issued pendant &quot;24L&quot;). Pre-war photos show the pendants painted correctly, with the flag inferior, but wartime photos show that the numbers tend to be painted &quot;backwards&quot;, in that the inferior was painted on as a superior. For obvious reasons, the inferior &quot;U&quot; was not used so as not to confuse friendly ships with German U-boats. For similar reasons &quot;V&quot; was not used. Pendant numbers 00–10, 13, and those ending in a zero were not allocated to flag inferiors.
* A — allied (Polish ORP &quot;Orzeł&quot; (85A))
* C (&quot;coastal&quot;) — (pre-war construction)
* F (&quot;fleet&quot;) — 
* H — H class
* L — L class
* M (&quot;minelayer&quot;) — 
* N — allocated to existing submarines after 1940.
* P — O class, P class
** 31P— U class (wartime construction), V class
** 211P to 299P — S class (wartime construction)
** 311P to 399P— T class
** 411P to 499P— A class
** 511P to 599P— United States Navy lend-lease submarines
** 611P to 699P— commandeered foreign construction
** 711P to 799P— captured enemy submarines
* R — R class
* S — S-class submarines (pre-war construction)
* T — T-class submarines (pre-war construction)

===Post-1948===
After the Second World War, in 1948, the Royal Navy adopted a rationalised &quot;pennant&quot; number system where the flag superior indicated the basic type of ship as follows. &quot;F&quot; and &quot;A&quot; use two or three digits, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot; up to four. Again, pennant 13 is not used (for instance the helicopter carrier was followed by ).
* A — auxiliaries (vessels of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service, and Royal Navy Auxiliary Service, including depot ships, boom defence vessels, etc.)
* C — cruisers (currently none in service, therefore unused)
* D — destroyers
* F — frigate (former escort destroyers, sloops and corvettes)
* H — shore signal stations (military); survey vessels
* K — miscellaneous vessels (e.g., the helicopter support ship or the seabed operations vessels RFA &quot;Proteus&quot; and )
* L — amphibious warfare ships
* M — minesweepers
* N — minelayers (currently none in service, therefore unused)
* P — patrol boats
* R — aircraft carriers
* S — submarines
* X — experimental vessels (currently, the only vessel to use this is XV Patrick Blackett which is not a commissioned ship of the Navy but is crewed and run by the Royal Navy)
* Y — yard vessels

===Flotilla bands===

====1925–1939====
From 1925, flotilla leaders were issued with but did not paint on pendant numbers. Instead, a broad band deep was painted round their fore-funnel. Divisional leaders wore a pendant number and had a narrower deep band on the fore-funnel, painted from the top. The Mediterranean Fleet wore black leader bands and the Atlantic – later Home Fleet wore white bands. The flotillas wore combinations of bands on their after funnel to identify them. From 1925 the following bands were worn;
* 1st Destroyer Flotilla — one black band
* 2nd Destroyer Flotilla — two black bands (one red from 1935)
* 3rd Destroyer Flotilla — three black bands
* 4th Destroyer Flotilla — no bands
* 5th Destroyer Flotilla — one white band
* 6th Destroyer Flotilla — two white bands
* 8th Destroyer Flotilla (from 1935) — one black and one white band

====Second World War====
When single funnelled destroyers entered the fleet with the J class in 1939 and with an expansion in the number of flotillas, the system was changed accordingly. Single funnelled ships wore a deep band as a flotilla leader. As a divisional leader they had a wide vertical band the same colour as, and extending below, the upper flotilla band. Leaders bands were white for Home Fleet, red for Mediterranean Fleet, and the system of flotilla bands changed to;
* 1st Destroyer Flotilla (Mediterranean) — 1 red, G class
* 2nd Destroyer Flotilla (Mediterranean) — 2 red, H class
* 3rd Destroyer Flotilla (Mediterranean) — 3 red bands, then none, I class
* 4th Destroyer Flotilla (Mediterranean) — none, Tribal class
* 5th Destroyer Flotilla (Mediterranean) — none, K class
* 6th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — 1 white, Tribal class
* 7th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — 2 white, J class
* 8th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — 3 white, F class
* 9th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — 1 black &amp; 2 white, V and W class
* 10th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — none, V &amp; W class
* 11th Destroyer Flotilla (Western Approaches) — 1 black over 2 red, V and W class
* 12th Destroyer Flotilla (Rosyth) — 1 white over 1 red, E class
* 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Gibraltar) — 1 white over 2 red, V and W class
* 14th Destroyer Flotilla (Home) — 1 red over 1 black, V and W class
* 15th Destroyer Flotilla (Rosyth) — 1 red over 2 black, V and W class
* 16th Destroyer Flotilla (Portsmouth) — 1 red over 1 white, V and W class
* 17th Destroyer Flotilla (Western Approaches) (from 1940) — 1 red over 2 white, Town class
* 18th Destroyer Flotilla (Channel) — 1 white &amp; 1 black, A class
* 19th Destroyer Flotilla (Dover)— 1 white over 2 black, B class
* 20th Destroyer Flotilla (Portsmouth) — 2 white over 1 black, C class
* 21st Destroyer Flotilla (China Station) — 2 white over 1 red, D class

Flotilla bands were used throughout the war although war-losses, operational requirements, and new construction broke up the homogeneity of the destroyer flotillas. Vessels were deployed as and when they were needed or available, and were often incorporated into mixed &quot;escort groups&quot; containing a range of vessel types such as sloops, corvettes, frigates and escort carriers. A few of the escort groups adopted funnel bands; others (like the B7 escort group) wore letters on their funnels.

====Post-war====
Post-war Flotillas were no longer identified by bands, but by large cast metal numbers bolted to the funnels. Flotilla leaders continued to display a large band at the top of the funnel and half leaders would carry a thin black band around the funnel.

===Deck codes===
Aircraft carriers and vessels operating aircraft have a deck code painted on the flight deck to aid identification by aircraft attempting to land. This is in a position clearly visible on the approach path. The Royal Navy uses a single letter (typically the first letter of the ship&#x27;s name) for aircraft carriers and large vessels operating aircraft, and pairs of letters (usually letters from the ship&#x27;s name) for smaller vessels. The United States Navy, with its larger fleet, uses the numeric part of the hull classification number (a system analogous to pennant numbers). Deck codes used by contemporary major British naval warships include:
* HMS &quot;Albion&quot; — AN
* — BK
* — DT
* HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; — O
* HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; — R
* HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; — N
* HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; — L
* — Q
* HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; — P
* RFA &quot;Argus&quot; — AS
* RFA &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; — YB
* RFA &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; — CB
* RFA &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; — MB

==International pennant numbers==
Several European NATO and Commonwealth navies agreed to introduce a pennant number system based on that of the Royal Navy. The system guarantees that, amongst those navies and other navies that later joined, all pennant numbers are unique. The United States and Canada do not participate in this system; their ships are identified by unique hull classification symbols.

Participating countries, with their assigned number ranges, include:
* Argentina — (D: 1x, 2x; P: 3x, 4x; S: 2x, 3x; C: x; V: x)
* Australia (formerly incorporated into the Royal Navy system until 1969; now uses a system based on the RN pennant number format and U.S. hull classification symbols)
* Belgium — (A:9xx; F: 9xx; M: 9xx; P:9xx)
* Denmark — (N: 0xx; A/M/P: 5xx; F/S/Y: 3xx; L: 0xx)
* France — (R: 9x; C/D/S: 6xx; F: 7xx; M/P/A: 6xx, 7xx; L: 9xxx)
* Germany — (A: 5x, 51x, 14xx; D: 1xx; F: 2xx; L: 76x; M: 10xx, 26xx; P: 61xx; S: 1xx)
* Greece — (D/P: 0x, 2xx; A/F: 4xx; L/S/M: 1xx)
* Italy — (5xx; D 5xx; F 5xx; P 4xx; 5xxx; A 5xxx; L 9xxx; Y 5xx; S 5xx)
* Kenya
* Malaysia
* New Zealand (F111-HMNZS Te Mana)
* Netherlands (8xx; Y: 8xxx)
* Norway (F/S/M: 3xx; P: 9xx; L: 45xx)
* Portugal (F/M: 4xx; S: 1xx; P: 11xx0)
* Spain (A: xx, F: 0x 1x 2x.., R: 01, 11, L: 0x, 1x.., P: 0x, 1x.., Y: xxx)
* Sri Lanka
* South Africa
* Turkey (D/S: 3xx; F: 2xx; N: 1xx; A/M: 5xx; P: 1xx, 3xx, L: 4xx; Y: 1xxx)
* United Kingdom (R: 0x; D: 0x &amp; 1xx; F: 0x, 1xx, 2xx; S: 0x, 1xx; M: 0x, 1xx, 1xxx, 2xxx; P: 1xx, 2xx, 3xx; L: 0x, 1xx, 3xxx, 4xxx; A: any)

The NATO pennant number system added the &quot;Y&quot; (for &quot;yard&quot;) symbol for tugboats, floating cranes, docks and the like.

==International Deck Codes==

<doc id="1177270" wikidata="Q162284" url="?curid=1177270" title="Battle of Kiev (1941)">
<text>The First Battle of Kiev was the German name for the major battle that resulted in an encirclement of Soviet troops in the vicinity of Kiev during World War II, the capital and most populous city of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. This encirclement is the largest encirclement in the history of warfare by number of troops. The battle occurred from 7 July to 26 September 1941 as part of Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.

Much of the Southwestern Front of the Red Army, commanded by Mikhail Kirponos, was encircled, but small groups of Red Army troops managed to escape the pocket in the days after the German panzers attacked east of the city, including the forces of Marshal Semyon Budyonny, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev. Kirponos was trapped behind German lines and was killed while trying to break out.

The battle was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, and was more damaging than the Battle of Białystok–Minsk of June–July 1941. The encirclement trapped 452,700 Soviet soldiers, 2,642 guns and mortars, and 64 tanks, of which only 15,000 soldiers escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. The Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured, or missing during the battle. The 5th, 37th, 26th, 21st, and 38th armies, consisting of 43 divisions, were almost annihilated and the 40th Army suffered many losses. Like the Western Front before it, the Southwestern Front had to be recreated almost from scratch.

Despite being referred to as the &quot;Battle of Kiev&quot;, the city of Kiev itself played a small and peripheral role in the overall battle. The battle took place over a large area in eastern Ukraine, with Kiev being the focal point of Soviet defenses, and of the German encirclement.

Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Third Reich, described the Battle of Kiev as &quot;the biggest battle in the history of the world&quot;, while Joseph Goebbels, the German minister of propaganda, called it &quot;the greatest battle of annihilation of all time&quot;. Historian Evan Mawdsley described the battle as the &quot;Ostheer&quot;&#x27;s &quot;greatest triumph of the war in the East and the Red Army’s greatest single disaster&quot;, while historian Michael Jones dubbed the battle to be &quot;the Wehrmacht’s greatest victory of the war&quot;.

==Prelude==
=== Plans and preparations ===
According to Barbarossa&#x27;s operational plan, the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Army Group South, under the command of Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, was supposed to dominate the strategic area of Ukraine. This force planned to reach the Dnieper river in an enveloping movement by breaking the Soviet border defense and penetrating 650 kilometers deep into Soviet territory, and encircling the main forces of the Red Army in Ukraine west of the river.

Soviet High Command knew that the main focus of German forces in their invasion would be north of the Pripyat marshes, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin insisted that the Soviet emphasis should be on the south. The Soviet Southwestern Front under the command of General Mikhail Kirponos in Ukraine was the most powerful front in the western border region of the Soviet Union, possessing a total of four field armies, with the support of three mechanized corps in the front line, one mechanized corps in reserve and two mechanized corps in strategic reserve position.

The Pripyat marshes separated the southern part of the operational area of the German forces from the northern part, and eliminated the possibility of receiving help from other German units until after the Kiev area had been secured. The operational area in Ukraine had a greater depth and width than those of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s other two army groups, and as Kiev was 600 km away from the border, it was considered a farther objective. These issues complicated the manoeuvres of the southern Wehrmacht group.

=== June and July ===
After the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Army Group South attacked Ukraine. The Red Army forces in this area put up a strong defense and despite a shortage of fuel and ammunition, they were ordered by the high command to carry out immediate counter-attacks. The 13th and 14th Panzer Divisions overcame this defense, and captured Lutsk on 26 June. Panzer Group 1 was the armored spearhead of Army Group South, and was thought to be in an ideal position to advance towards Kiev via Rivne. Meanwhile, Kirponos was trying to mount a concentrated counterattack. Commencement of his counter-attack on 26 June led to an armored battle of unprecedented scale between more than 2,000 tanks on a 70-kilometer front line. The inexperience of the Red Army officers in controlling the mass of armored forces, contributed to the failure of this counter-attack, and resulted in destruction of many Soviet reserves in the region. German forces also sustained heavy casualties however, and thus Army Group South lagged behind the rest of the advancing German forces.

On 30 June, Lvov was captured by the German 17th Army. On the same day, due to the ineffectiveness of earlier counter-attacks, Stavka ordered Kirponos to withdraw his forces to new defensive positions by 9 July, in the fortified areas of Korosten, Novgorod-Volynski and Letychiv along the 1939 Soviet-Polish border, known as the Stalin Line. Despite the delay in the advance of the German III Motorized Corps due to the Kirponos counterattack, by the arrival of the 11th Panzer Division at Berdichev on 7 July, the Stalin line was also broken and a gap was created between the Soviet 5th and 6th Armies south of Novgorod-Volynski.

With Kiev under threat and the risk of the Southwestern Front splitting in half between the Soviet 5th Army in Kiev and 6th Army south of Berdychiv, Stavka ordered a new series of counter-attacks on the same day to destroy the enemy spearhead, stop the advance of the Germans towards Kiev and maintain communication between these two armies. However, before these counterattacks began between 11 and 14 July, the capture of Zhitomir by German forces on 8 July created a weakness in Soviet defenses, and the German III Motorized Corps managed to break through the line and open the road to Kiev on 10 July. On the same day, the 13th Panzer Division of the III Motorized Corps created a defensive gap known as the &quot;Zhitomir Corridor&quot; that reached the Irpen River, just 15 kilometers west of Kiev. Red Army counterattacks again caused significant damage to the mobile forces of the Soviet Southwestern Front, such that only 7 BT and 25 T-26 tanks of the 9th Mechanized Corps, 4 KV-1, 7 T-34 and 22 T-26 tanks of the 19th Mechanized Corps and 2 BT and 28 T-26 tanks of the 22nd Mechanized Corps remained out of their initial strength.

Due to some parts of the German forces lagging 100 km behind, the decision of whether to attack Kiev immediately was left to the higher levels of German command. At this time, Nikita Khrushchev, the political commissar of the Southwestern Front, was in charge of the Kiev garrison, which included three rifle divisions, an airborne brigade, a tank regiment, some NKVD motorized forces, students of the 1st Artillery College of Kiev, two anti-tank battalions, and about 29,000 militiamen.

== Debates over the attack on Kiev ==
On 9 July, Army Group South command and the German Army High Command (OKH) re-emphasized the encirclement and destruction of the Soviet forces west of the Dnieper as the main objective of the operation. Seeing as the Soviet South-West Front was close to collapsing, capturing Kiev was considered to be a secondary goal. At this time Hitler did not want to assault Kiev, and prioritised the capture of a bridgehead on the Dnieper, subject to the destruction of large formations of Soviet forces west of the river. However, German Army senior commanders were still interested in capturing Kiev. Repeated attacks by the forces of the Soviet 5th Army from the Pripyat region kept the German 6th Army occupied and unable to be used for this purpose. Rundstedt was confident that Kiev would be captured by the III Motorized Corps in its rapid advance, but Hitler, after consulting with Field marshal Walter von Brauchitsch, commander in chief of the German army, felt that such a move would &quot;unnecessarily sacrifice&quot; panzer forces. Finally, at 1am on 10 July, Generaloberst Franz Halder, chief of the German army general staff, called the headquarters of the Army Group South and prohibited the use of panzer forces in the direction of Kiev, except for reconnaissance and security purposes. By approving this order, Hitler made the III Motorized Corps only responsible for protection against attacks from the direction of Kiev, and ordered them to avoid assaulting the city. He further pointed out that if the encirclement of the Soviet forces up to the southern Bug River was not achieved, the whole of the 1st Armored Group would advance towards Kiev and the Dnieper River in the southeast.

Meanwhile, Rundstedt believed that with the retreat of many units of the Red Army to the east, it was no longer practical to encircle them up to the southern Bug River, and together with Halder, he wanted to encircle them around Bila Tserkva, west of the Dnieper River. Hitler expressed his consent to this, provided that the northern flank of Panzer Group 1 would be protected. Brauchich took advantage of the ambiguity of this order, and concluded that the capture of Kiev would secure the Panzer Group&#x27;s northern flank, but left the final decision to the commander of the Army Group South. Meanwhile, Rundstedt and Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau, commander of the German 6th Army, who had previously supported the assault on Kiev, now doubted it. Finally, Generaloberst Ewald von Kleist, commander of Panzer Group 1, was advised that if his offensive in coordination with the 6th Army provided a suitable opportunity to capture this city without the risk of being pushed back, then he was free to do so. Finally, the reconnaissance forces of the Wehrmacht determined on 13 July that the fortifications and concentration of the Soviet forces in Kiev left no chance for a surprise attack.

== Change in German strategy ==
In early July, after the end of the battle of Smolensk, German Army Group Center planned to attack Moscow from three axes, commencing in the beginning of September. The Soviet 5th Army held its previous positions in the Pripyat Marshes until mid-July, and this caused the creation of an additional front line of more than 250 kilometers in the open southern and northern flanks of the German army groups Center and South. In the face of this situation and following the strong resistance of the Soviet forces around Smolensk, German army High Command changed its strategy for the continuation of the operation from mid-July. Hitler&#x27;s directive No. 33 on 19 July, while criticizing the performance of the northern flank of the Army Group South against the Soviet 5th Army, mandated the German forces to &quot;prevent escape of large amounts of enemy forces by crossing the Dnieper River deep into the Russian territories and destroy them&quot;. On this basis, the left wing of the Army Group South, in cooperation with the right wing of the Army Group Center, moved to destroy the Soviet 5th Army. Army Group Center continued its advance towards Moscow only with its infantry. Joint command was not established for the parts of both army groups that were to cooperate in the new operation.

== Initial Soviet strategy ==
On 23 July, Stavka formed the Central Front under the command of General Fyodor Kuznetsov, consisting of the severely weakened 13th and 21st Armies, to protect the Gomel and the Sozh River regions on the southern flank of the German Army Group Center.

General Georgy Zhukov, the Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army, upon receiving information from the front line, concluded that the movement of the Army Group Center to the east had stopped and that the biggest strategic threat to the Soviet forces was to the Central Front, where the movement of German mechanized forces to the south could cause the Soviet Southwestern Front to become in danger of being encircled. Zhukov told Stalin on 29 July that the success of any German advance toward Leningrad and Moscow seemed unlikely, but that the Gomel region was the Red Army&#x27;s key strategic weakness. Therefore, Zhukov recommended that three armies, including one army from the strategic reserve and two armies from the Western and Southwestern Fronts, and larger amounts of artillery, be assigned to the Central Front. He also recommended that Lieutenant General Nikolai Vatutin be appointed as its commander. Stalin stated that the transfer of those forces would weaken the defenses of Moscow. In response, Zhukov stated that it was possible to transfer nine fully equipped divisions from the Far East within two weeks to strengthen these defenses, but Stalin expressed concern that the Far East would then be vulnerable to Japanese attack. Zhukov suggested that the Soviet Southwestern Front be pulled back behind the Dnieper River. When Stalin asked about the fate of Kiev in this case, Zhukov stated that it could be abandoned. Stalin became upset and rebuked Zhukov in a harsh tone and called his words &quot;worthless&quot;. He stated his intention was to preserve Kiev at all costs, like Leningrad. Zhukov told Stalin that if he thought the Chief of the General Staff was talking &quot;nonsense&quot;, he should be dismissed and sent to the front line. Stalin agreed to this request and appointed Marshal Boris Shaposhnikov to replace Zhukov as the chief of the Red Army General Staff, and for Zhukov to command the Soviet reserve front.

== Continuation of Army Group South&#x27;s advance ==

Despite the stubborn resistance of the Red Army forces and unexpectedly heavy rain, the German 17th Army managed to break through in the Vinnytsia region, and the 11th Army advanced to the Dniester River. Panzer Group 1 was able to reach the Dnieper River and create a bridgehead on it south of Kiev. On 28 July, Stavka ordered the Southwestern and Southern Fronts to disrupt the German offensive, and prevent more of them from reaching the Dnieper River. In response, the Southwestern Front had to re-organize its forces and prepare to attack towards Radomyshl and Zhitomir to connect with the Southern Front. However, Germans completed their encirclement of Soviet forces in Uman region on 4 August, trapping the Soviet 6th and 12th Armies in it. Stavka reorganised troops; the Soviet 5th Army received the 1st Airborne Corps, the 15th and 31st Rifle Corps, and the 9th and 22nd Mechanized Corps, and was ordered to attack the same day. The 5th Army&#x27;s counterattack was stopped on 8 August with little gain and heavy casualties. On the same day, Korosten, 150 kilometers northwest of Kiev, was captured by the German XVII Army Corps, forcing the Soviet 5th Army to retreat towards Kiev.

On 4 August, Stavka placed the 38th Soviet Army and the 8th Mechanized Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Dmitry Ryabyshev, and ordered all available units in the Cherkasy region to cover the gap created as a result of the loss of the Uman region armies. This army had a total strength of 40,000 men in five rifle and four cavalry divisions, which had mostly recently arrived in the region, and were tasked to defend a 200 km front line. Stavka also formed the Soviet 37th Army under Major General Andrey Vlasov six days later, after the Soviet 6th and 12th Armies were officially disbanded, and stationed it on the line of the Dnieper River between Kiev and Kremenchuk.

The most advanced elements of the German 6th Army reached the outskirts of Kiev on 6 August, but were stopped by the Soviet 37th Army. Two days later, the 6th Army was forced to take a defensive position and was pushed back from some positions by the 37th Army&#x27;s counterattack from 12 August. On the same day, Hitler ordered Rundstedt to stop the assault on Kiev.

Rundstedt issued his Order No. 5 on 10 August, ordering his forces to capture the west bank of the Dnieper River. As part of this operation, Nikolaev was captured by Germans on 16 August, and the SS panzer division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; reached Kherson on 19 August. Meanwhile, the German 22nd Infantry Division of the III Army Corps captured a 650-metre bridge over the Dnieper in Breslav for the 11th Army, the 9th Panzer Division secured a crossing over the Dnieper in Zaporozhye, and the 13th Panzer Division captured a 900-meter bridge in Dnipropetrovsk on 25 August. On the next day, the German 60th Motorized Infantry Division reinforced this bridgehead, and was joined within a week by the 198th Infantry Division and SS &quot;Viking&quot; Division. The heavy counterattacks of the Red Army on this position targeted the Germans from three sides, but the Wehrmacht forces, with the support of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft, including the 22nd Italian fighter group, repelled them. Rundstedt tried to create another bridgehead in Cherkasy to reduce the pressure on the bridgeheads. When this succeeded, Marshal Semyon Budyonny, commander of the Soviet Southwestern Front, counter-attacked against Cherkasy.

== Army Group Center&#x27;s advance to the south ==
According to the 29 July report, out of the initial 953 tanks of the Army Group Center&#x27;s Panzer Group 2 at the beginning of the operation, only 263 tanks remained serviceable as of 25 July. This unit also lost about 20,000 men out of its initial strength of 113,000 troops up to this time, while receiving only 10,000 soldiers as replacements. Therefore, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian, commander of the Panzer Group 2 in the right (southern) flank of the Army Group Center, informed the Army Group commander that his units would not be ready to undertake any new operations before 5 August. Facing a high number of enemy forces and logistical problems, on 30 July, Hitler issued directive No. 34, ordering Army Group Center to pull its two panzer groups out of the front line to rebuild and refit in order to transfer them to the flanks, while also taking a defensive posture in the best positions along with limited offensive operations. The purpose was to focus the German advance on Leningrad in the north and Kiev and Ukraine in the south. The movement of Army Group Center to the south created the possibility that, considering the battlefield conditions and the bulge on the front line, a very large encirclement would be created if the Red Army forces did not evacuate the bulge in time.

Due to the German Army High Command&#x27;s emphasis on Moscow, in order to preserve the necessary resources for the future advance to the east, the number of units initially assigned to Panzer Group 2 for the new operation was limited. By Halder&#x27;s order, despite Guderian&#x27;s opposition and protest, only units of the Panzer Group 2 were to be used, which &quot;are not needed in other missions of the Army Group Center and have enough readiness and mobility for combat&quot;. In order to counter the Soviet 5th Army, Halder ordered the capture of the parts of Gomel and Chernigov that could be reached.

By the beginning of the execution of Hitler&#x27;s directive No. 34 on 6 August by the Central Army Group, the German Second Army and the XXIV Motorized Corps of the Panzer Group 2 attacked in the direction of Gomel in the south by crossing the Suzh River. Guderian&#x27;s forces, along with air support of the 3rd and 53rd bomber, 210th heavy fighter and 51st fighters wings, pushed back the 21st Army of the Soviet Central Front to the south, threatening Red Army front line by creating a gap between its Southern Front around Kiev and the units of the Western and Reserve Fronts east of Smolensk. On 14 August, Stavka tried to block the Germans advance by filling the gap between the Western and Reserve Fronts and the weak Soviet Central Front by forming the Bryansk Front, under the command of Lieutenant General Andrey Yeryomenko, with the 3rd and 13th Armies and the newly formed 50th Army. This front, with a total of 15 rifle divisions, three cavalry divisions, one tank division and one airborne corps, was tasked with covering a front line of 230 kilometers from south of Roslavl in the north to Novgorod-Sversky in the south.

Colonel General Fyodor Kuznetsov, the commander of the Central Front, decided to abandon Gomel on 15 August. The Soviet rearguard left behind to protect the retreat of the rest of the Central Front forces defended Gomel against the Germans. On 16 August, Bock ordered the German Second Army to leave only the necessary forces in the Zhlobin area and with the rest of its forces to attack Gomel in the south. However, the resistance and attacks of the Red Army in the Gomel region on the same day stopped the advance of the XLIII and XIII Army Corps of the German 2nd Army to the south. In order to prevent the escape of Soviet forces from the Gomel area, Guderian ordered the XXIV Motorized Corps to Starodub, 120 km east of Gomel. The road junction in Meglin, 60 kilometers north of Starodub, was captured by the 3rd Panzer Division of this corps on 16 August. The next day, despite enduring heavy pressure from the west, the German 10th Motorized Infantry and 3rd Panzer Divisions captured and destroyed a section of the Gomel-Bryansk railway.

Guderian&#x27;s panzer forces and the infantry of the Second Army occupied Pochep, 60 km northeast of Starodub, and reached the outskirts of Gomel and Starodub by 18 August, in order to sever the connection between the Soviet 13th and 21st Armies and cause a break between the Soviet Central and Reserve Fronts. On the same day, Stavka formed the 40th Army, under the command of Major General Kuzma Podlas, as part of the Southwestern Front, specifically to block Guderian&#x27;s advance. This force was weak however, only consisting of two rifle divisions and an airborne corps, which had been severely weakened by previous battles in the Dnieper River area. On 19 August, some units of the 3rd Panzer Division were surrounded by Red Army forces near Oncha, 30 kilometers north of Starodub. As the situation became serious, some forward forces of the 3rd Panzer Division returned to Oncha, disengaging from Starodub. Despite the settlement of the situation in Oncha, the infantry of the German 2nd Army was still far away from this place due to the clashes in the Zhlobin area, and the Red Army still blocked the Meglin-Oncha road.

The Wehrmacht&#x27;s supply lines were unable to keep up with the advance of its panzer forces on the bad roads of the region. The poor mechanical condition of the panzer divisions and the proneness of their tanks to break down further hampered Guderian&#x27;s advance. Thus, during this period, despite the order of the German Army High Command to the XXIV Motorized Corps to advance towards Gomel from the east, this unit was unable to do so. The lack of coordination between the German divisions created a difficult situation in the Gomel region. The diaries of the logistics officer of 3rd Panzer Division on 18 August stated: &quot;The advance of the division is so rapid that the [supply] columns are unable to keep themselves coordinated.&quot; The supply columns of the XXIV Motorized Corps were moving at an average speed of only 12 kilometers per hour during this advance. The next day, the lack of fuel forced Generel der Panzertruppen Leo Geyr von Schwepenburg, the commander of the XXIV Motorized Corps, to inform Guderian&#x27;s headquarters that the capture of Novozibkov, 70 kilometers east of Gomel, was not feasible. Guderian, in turn, reported this issue to Bock. In addition to the fuel issue, the lack of spare parts brought the number of operational tanks of the 4th Panzer Division to only 44, and on 22 August in 3rd Panzer Division to only 60 tanks. Finally, on 21 August, the XXIV Motorized Corps was resupplied with fuel by air, and Starodub was captured on 22 August.

The final German attack on Gomel began on 19 August, with XIII Army Corps attacking it from the northwest and northeast. The 17th Infantry Division penetrated into the city from the west and north, leading to intense house-to-house clashes. By evening, the Red Army troops were pushed to the southern part of the city, where they attempted to destroy all the bridges over the Sozh River in the city. The fighting continued for another day in Gomel. Despite the strong resistance of the Soviet 21st Army, Panzer Group 2 and the 2nd Army completely captured Gomel by 21 August. The clearing of the city of remaining Red Army elements was done by the German 131st Infantry Division. A third of the Soviet defenders of Gomel were encircled and defeated. About 50,000 soldiers were captured by the Germans in this position. After the capture of Gomel, the Soviet 5th Army, enduring heavy pressure in its northern flank from the German 2nd Army, began to retreat eastward from the area north of Mosir, southwest of the Pripyat Marshes.

== Guderian&#x27;s entry into Ukraine ==
On 21 August, Hitler ordered the German 2nd Army and Panzer Group 2 to advance to the south, deeper into Ukraine. However, on 23 August, the German Army High Command, in planning to pursue a simultaneous offensive towards the south and Moscow, split the Panzer Group 2 and ordered XLVIII Motorized Corps to remain in the Smolensk region as a mobile reserve. On the same day, Guderian, without knowing about the order, in his meeting with Hitler in Wolfschanze, was promised that his panzer group would remain united reaffirmed. The next day, Guderian learned about the order from High Command and immediately requested the return of the corps, which was scheduled to join the 4th Army. However, he was turned down by Bock. Panzer Group 2 resumed its advance to the south on 25 August, attacking the Soviet central front through Gomel and Starodub, driving it back in disarray towards the Desna River.

The Desna River was considered a major natural obstacle in front of Guderian&#x27;s forces on their way to Ukraine. On 25 August, the 3rd Panzer Division reached Novgorod-Sversky on the bank of the river. Panzer Group 2 initially received reports about the destruction of a vital bridge across the Desna. However, it was revealed that the 800-meter bridge had been captured intact by the 3rd Panzer Division on the morning of 26 August. Guderian called this news &quot;surprising and the most pleasant&quot;. After this success, the 3rd Panzer Division expanded its front eight kilometers beyond the river to protect the bridgehead. The next day, Soviet forces attempted to take back the eastern bank of the river and destroy the bridge. The German front was pushed back, but the Germans eventually repulsed the attacks. The German 10th Motorized Infantry Division also captured another crossing on the Desna River near Kurup, 50 km southwest of Novgorod-Sversky. On 30 August, this division tried to continue advancing south alone, but directly contacted Yeryomenko&#x27;s offensive front line and was repulsed. According to diaries of Bock and Guderian, this division was unable to protect its bridgehead south of the Desna river against the attack of four enemy divisions. This assault weakened the 3rd Panzer Division and the 10th Motorized Infantry Division of the XXIV Motorized Corps to such an extent that these divisions took a defensive position for a while.

== German Army Group South crosses the Dnieper ==

By the end of August, the Soviet Southwestern Front, consisting of more than 50 divisions in 6 armies, was in a triangular formation with its apex west of Kiev at a depth of 500 km. The long flanks of this front were attacked from the north by the German Panzer Armored Group 2 and the 2nd Army, from the west by the German 6th Army, and from the south by the German Panzer Group 1 and the 17th Army. Even before the start of the new German operation, the Soviet Southwestern front was in a precarious position and already semi-encircled. The most powerful formations of Kirponos, being deployed in the western areas, were not facing the danger of the German Panzer forces on the outer flanks. Kirponos was aware of these conditions, but the approach of the Soviet High Command did not allow him to take effective action.

After Budyonny and Kirponos&#x27;s repeated requests to Stavka to withdraw the Soviet 5th Army to shorter lines, and the Soviet High Command&#x27;s agreement to that on 19 August, German forces crossed the Dnieper to the east on 23 August. The command of the German 6th Army did not expect the withdrawal of the Soviet 5th Army until 18 August. Halder and the command of the Army Group South ordered to quickly pursue these Soviet forces. Bad roads in the area delayed the German 6th Army. The Soviet 5th Army was not able to destroy the wooden bridge over the Dnieper behind itself, and the bridge was assaulted by LI Army Corps of the German 6th Army and 11th Panzer Division forces, leading to its capture. Kirponos ordered all air assets at his disposal to destroy the bridge, and Soviet Il-2 aircraft destroyed the bridge with incendiary bombs, cutting off the German troops who had crossed the Dnieper River form behind. These forces were isolated from other German units in the marshes between the Dnieper and Desna for ten days until the German engineers repaired the bridge by 2 September.

On 26 August, the XVII Army Corps of the German 6th Army in the northern flank of the Army Group South captured Chernobyl, 110 km north of Kiev. On 1 September, Generalleutnant Georg von Sudenstern, the Chief of Staff of Army Group South, communicated with the Army Group Center&#x27;s 2nd Army in order to coordinate his left wing. He stated that due to the lack of equipment required to cross the river, the 6th Army of the Army Group South is dependent on the help of the German 2nd Army to do so.

Due to a lack of supplies, the motorized corps of Panzer Group 1 rested and rebuilt for several days from 27 to 28 August. Meanwhile, the XXIV Motorized Corps, as Guderian&#x27;s armored spearhead in the northern part of the Wehrmacht operation in the Kiev region, began a new operation on 25 August. However, due to the difficult geographical conditions east of the Dnieper River and north of Kiev, Rundstedt was worried about the escape of the Soviet forces to the east. The strong resistance of the Soviet 5th Army and the logistical problems of the German 2nd and 6th Armies intensified this concern. On 28 and 29 August, he ordered Panzer Group 1 and the 6th and 17th armies to cross the Dnieper River in as many places as possible. On 1 September, Panzer Group 1 received an order to end their period of rebuilding and return to the front line. This meant that the command of Army Group South decided to use its worn-out forces with &quot;the last of their remaining strength&quot; and without rest.

The LII Army Corps of the German 17th Army seized a crossing on the Dnieper in Drifka, south of Kremenchuk, 280 kilometers southeast of Kiev, on 31 August. The Panzer forces of Army Group South expanded this bridgehead by reinforcing it on 4 September. Facing this danger, Marshal Budyonny immediately ordered the Soviet 38th Army under the command of Major General Feklenko, to destroy the German forces that had crossed the river. However, this army was too weak to do so, and its planned counterattack for 8 September was not executed.

The intensification of the Soviet resistance, and the knowledge that the Red Army was redistributing its best troops, caused the Germans to change their assessment of the situation after the end of August, and made it clear that Stalin had ordered Soviet forces to preserve the Dnieper river line. Initially, Rundstedt planned to send the 17th Army towards Guderian to the north through the Kremenchuk bridgehead, so the 1st Panzer Group would attack through the Dnipropetrovsk bridgehead to the east. Accordingly, on 4 September, Army Group South ordered the 17th Army to attack the Mirgorod-Lubny general line in order to encircle the enemy forces in the Middle Dnieper region and Kiev. Panzer Group 1 was to cover the right flank of this movement by advancing towards Poltava via Krasnograd in a northerly direction. After a meeting on 8 September at the headquarters of Army Group South in presence of Brauchich and Halder, it was decided to reverse the roles of the 17th Army and the Panzer Group 1. The purpose of this change was to complete the encirclement of the enemy as quickly as possible.

In addition, it was decided that the Panzer Group 1 would advance to Romny, 200 km to the north, and hold a 100 km line from Lubny in the south in order to block the path of possible strong enemy attacks from this area to open an escape route. Four infantry divisions of the 17th Army were also ordered to hold the rest of the encirclement ring from Lubny to the south, while its other six infantry divisions were to move towards Kharkov in the east. The start date of the new operation was set on 11 September. Before Halder left the meeting, Rundstedt asked him to put Panzer Group 2 and the 2nd Army under his command in order to create unity in the command of operations in the Kiev area, which was rejected.

The V Air Corps Luftwaffe was deployed to new bases in Kirovgrad and Uman to provide air support to Army Group South. The LII, LV and parts of the XI Army Corps of the German 17th Army crossed the Dnieper in the center of the front line of the Southern Army Group on 10 September. Panzer Group 1, led by the forces of Major-General Hans-Valentin Hube in the 16th Panzer Division of XLVIII Motorized Corps, began crossing the Dnieper on 11 September. By 12 September, Army Group South concentrated 20 divisions in this area against 5 rifle and 4 cavalry divisions of the 38th Army in the southern flank of the Soviet southwestern front. Rain, muddy roads, logistical problems and local counter-attacks of the Red Army delayed the advance of the Army Group South to some extent. 16th Panzer Division was used as the armored spearhead of the XLVIII Motorized Corps and initially achieved success, but after running out of fuel, stopped to resupply. At this time, Panzer Group 1 had a total of 331 tanks, which was equivalent to 53% of its initial strength on 22 June. After collecting the necessary supplies and building a suitable bridge, XLVIII Motorized Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Werner Kempf, resumed the attack.

== Soviet counter-attacks on the Bryansk front ==
Beyond the losses inflicted to the Red Army as a result of the Army Group Center actions in the northern (Velikye Luki area) and southern (Roslavl, Krychev, Zhlobin, and then Gomel) flanks, Soviet command believed these attacks were merely tactical measures to divert attention or resources from the vital Smolensk-Moscow axis. Until this time, the Soviet senior commanders thought that Guderian&#x27;s movement to the south objective was attacking to Bryansk and then Moscow. Therefore, the Bryansk Front was generally responsible for defending the Moscow axis from the southwest and was not responsible for preventing the penetration of the Panzer Group 2 in the northern flank of the Soviet Southwestern Front. Moreover, by keeping troops in the Kiev area, the Soviet High Command hoped to use them against the southern flank of Army Group Center as it advanced towards Moscow.

However, contrary to the expectations of the Red Army, Guderian continued to attack to the south with little resistance, taking the Soviets by surprise. However, Stalin still insisted that Kirponos should continue to defend Kiev at any cost and believed that the Bryansk front, in addition to protecting the Bryansk axis, was also capable of defeating the enemy forces that were threatening the northern and southwestern fronts, and destroying them as well. Stalin refused to order an all-out attack by the Bryansk front against Guderian&#x27;s eastern flank in order to preserve the forces of the front to stop the future advance of Army Group Center towards Moscow.

The Western Front was under the command of General Semyon Timoshenko, the Reserve Front under the command of General Zhukov, and the Bryansk Front under the command of General Yeryomenko. On 25 August, Stavka ordered them to carry out concentrated counter-attacks in the Smolensk-Yelnia-Novozibkov axis to repel Guderian&#x27;s invasion, and in the process to confront the entirety of Army Group Center. Accordingly, after the dissolution of the Soviet Central Front and addition of the Soviet 21st Army under its command, the Bryansk Front was ordered to defeat the Panzer Group 2 by conducting a direct attack and to bolster the strong defense of the north of Kiev. This operation was to take place on a very wide front line from Zhukovka in the north to Yampol in the south. On 26 August, Stavka asked the Bryansk front to encircle and destroy Guderian&#x27;s forces in Starodub, and bring the flanks of the Soviet 13th and 21st armies closer to each other. This order was issued while the assembly of the Bryansk Front was not yet completed, and its implementation would cause the use of the Red Army forces piecemeal. There was also a large gap between the main part of the Bryansk Front and the reinforcements from the former Central Front, and only the Soviet 50th Army was fresh and capable of sustained offensive operations. Stavka insisted on continuing these counterattacks despite these problems. False information led the Red Army to believe that the Germans were planning to inflict a heavy blow on the right (north) flank of the Bryansk front. Therefore, Shaposhnikov ordered Yeryomenko to reinforce this part with the 50th Army. This action caused this army to move from the threatened area to an area where there was no danger, and the counterattack of the Bryansk front was greatly weakened at a vital point.

After the failure of the first counterattack of the Bryansk Front, on 28 August, Stavka ordered a massive air attack by 450 aircraft of the Bryansk Front with at least 100 DB-3 bombers against the German tanks. Between 29 August and 4 September, Soviet aircraft made more than 4,000 sorties against Panzer Group 2. Despite Yeryomenko&#x27;s post-war claims that this massive air offensive was &quot;very effective&quot;, these Soviet air attacks had little effect on Guderian&#x27;s advance. During these attacks, 55 Soviet aircraft were shot down, and 57 other aircraft were destroyed by German attacks on eight Soviet air bases. Following this inconclusive air operation, two days later Stavka again ordered the whole Bryansk Front to launch another counterattack towards Roslavl and Starodub, and destroy Guderian&#x27;s forces at Pochep, Novgorod-Sversky and Novozibkov, and subsequently further advance to reach the Petrovich-Klimovichi-Schers line by 15 September. Yeryomenko ordered the counteroffensive to begin on 2 September. The two shock groups of the Bryansk front operated in two axes with a distance of 140 kilometers between them.

Elsewhere, the Soviet 108th Tank Division attacked on 30 August with more than 90 tanks, including a large number of KV-1 heavy tanks on which the usual German anti-tank weapons did not work, against the 17th Panzer Division of XLVII Motorized Corps in the eastern flank of Guderian. This attack created a 2-kilometer breach in the German lines and raised the concern of splitting this German corps in half. The 17th Panzer Division&#x27;s counterattack next day was ineffective due to the superiority of the Red Army tanks, and resulted in the loss of 11 German tanks. On 1 September, the counterattack of the 18th Panzer Division, another division of XLVII Motorized Corps, also collided with the Soviet 4th Cavalry Division, which was in the area in support of its tank division. Finally, with the fire concentration from two Panzer divisions and the air support of the II Air Corps of the Luftwaffe, the attack of Yeryomenko&#x27;s tanks was repelled after causing great damage to both sides.

Due to the confusing operational conditions, the reorganization of the Bryansk front faced many supply problems which were not resolved until the beginning of the operation. Therefore, Yeryomenko asked for the postponement of the counterattack until 3 September, which was agreed to by Soviet Command. However, under pressure from Stavka, Yeryomenko was again forced to launch the counterattack on 2 September. After two hours of artillery shelling, both shock groups directly attacked Guderian&#x27;s advance forces. Inadequate air support, uncoordinated attacks and other factors caused this counterattack of the Bryansk front to fail, with the XLVII Motorized Corps repelling these counterattacks. During these clashes, the armored forces of the Soviet Bryansk Front were destroyed, and Guderian&#x27;s tanks continued to move south.

== Discussion about continuation of the Wehrmacht operation ==
On 26 August, Guderian asked again the German Army High Command to release the XLVI Motorized Corps, but was once again rejected. On 27 August, during a visit of Major General Friedrich Paulus, Quartermeister of OKH, to the headquarters of the Panzer Group 2, Guderian again requested to receive more reinforcements. Guderian stated that the German 2nd Army, advancing towards the southwest, was in an operationally diverging course from Panzer Group 2, and was now separated from the right wing of the XXIV Motorized Corps, which created a 75 km gap between them. He considered the left (eastern) wing of the XXIV Motorized Corps to be similarly insecure. Guderian proposed a solution; transferring the XIII and XLIII Corps as well as the 1st Cavalry Division from the 2nd Army to his command. Guderian also repeated his request for the return of the XLVI motorized corps, and Paulus agreed to support these requests. On the same day, Guderian contacted General-Major Hans von Greifenberg, the Chief of Staff of Army Group Center, and made a similar request for reinforcements. Considering the pressure exerted on the long defensive line of the Army Group Center and its need to have a mobile reserve, Bock, in consultation with Halder, initially agreed only to move the 1st Cavalry Division closer to the right flank of the XXIV Motorized Corps. When Guderian insisted on his demands again on 29 August, Bock rejected Guderian&#x27;s request, stating that the XXIV Motorized Corps had informed the 2nd Army that it did not consider there to be a threat on its right flank. However, Bock agreed for the Grossdeutschland infantry regiment to be transferred to Guderian on the next day.

On 30 August, the Operations department of the German Army General staff ordered Army Group Center to prepare to place the divisions of the 2nd Army under the command of Panzer Group 2 after the 2nd Army crossed on Desna river, &quot;in order to continue operations with the Army Group South&quot;. The headquarters and &quot;parts of the 2nd Army that are not needed in the continuation of operations south of the Desna River&quot; remained at the disposal of the Army Group Center. The number of these &quot;required divisions&quot; depended on the demands of Army Group South, placing them at the forefront of decision-making.

In the meantime, the issue of continuing the advance to the east towards Moscow was intensively discussed by German high command. A plan was formed that Panzer Group 2 and the 2nd Army would stop at the Nagin-Konotop railway, before completing the encirclement of the Soviet Southwestern Front, and then rush eastward with the rest of Army Group Center. In this regard, after being informed about the Army General staff directive, Hitler informed Brauchitsch on 30 August that the strength of the Army Group Center around Desna River should not be used for operations in Ukraine, but must be prepared to be used to advance towards Moscow. Bock, who had initially wanted to continue advance towards Moscow, now saw operational opportunities in the south, and so was opposed to this plan. He considered Guderian&#x27;s movement as irreversible, and strongly desired to complete the offensive to the south, to avoid a time-consuming and costly redeployment of forces. Hitler decided to allow Guderian to continue south and connect to the Panzer Group 1.

== Continuation of Guderian&#x27;s advance ==
At this time, while the XLVII Motorized Corps was solely responsible for protecting the long left (eastern) flank of the Panzer Group 2, only 86 operational tanks were left for XXIV Motorized Corps as Guderian&#x27;s armored spearhead. This was equivalent to less than half of the tanks of the 3rd Panzer Division at the beginning of the Barbarossa operation. Only the 4th Panzer division of this corps was capable of offensive operations at the time. Therefore, that same evening, Bock reluctantly agreed to send the SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot; to Guderian. According to Bock, in a report on 2 September, Guderian described the situation of the Panzer Group 2 so pessimistic that the commander of the army group proposed to get permission for the tactical withdrawal of Guderian&#x27;s forces from OKH, so that these forces could support the German 2nd army on their left flank. Guderian immediately rejected this proposal and used the opportunity to insist on his previous request for reinforcements. Finally, under the influence of Guderian&#x27;s report, Bock agreed to release the XLVI Motorized Corps on 2 September.

After four days of halting their armored spearhead at the Desna river crossing and receiving sufficient supplies, the advance of the Panzer Group 2 to the south was resumed on 31 August. Guderian&#x27;s offensive pushed aside the Bryansk front and put the Soviet 180th tank division in a semi-encirclement situation at the end of 2 September, while also dealing a heavy blow to its 4th cavalry division. Until 6 September, the mobile forces of the Bryansk front were surrounded and fighting for their survival. Guderian&#x27;s forces had captured around 30,000 Soviet forces prior to the tenth day of their advance in Ukraine.

Following this, Stalin severely criticized Yeryomenko, and ordered him to pull his troops out of the encirclement if possible, and to use any available air forces even in bad weather. At this time, only 16 tanks and 5 armored vehicles were available for the Soviet 108th tank division, and only 38 tanks were left in the 141 tank brigade. Yeryomenko tried desperate measures to free his troops, including the use of roadblocking units that opened fire on his own forces that were retreating without permission, but was unsuccessful.

In a report to Stalin on 4 September, Budyonny described the threat to his flanks and requested immediate reinforcements. In the absence of this possibility, Budyonny requested permission to create a reserve force for himself by transferring four divisions from the 37th and 26th armies of the Western Front. At Stalin&#x27;s behest, Shaposhnikov rejected both of Budyonny&#x27;s requests. On 6 September, when the Soviet 21st Army was placed under the command of the Southwest Front, Kirponos ordered this army to attack the rear of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions XXIV Motorized Corps from the west. The actions of Kirponos did not affect the movement of Guderian&#x27;s armored forces and they crossed the Saim river the next day. Faced with a dangerous situation, on 7 September, Kirponos asked for permission to withdraw his forces north of Kiev to the eastern side of the Desna River. After the fall of Chernigov On 8 September to German 2nd Army, Shaposhnikov informed the Southwestern Front on 9 September that the High Command had decided to withdraw the Fifth Army and the right wing of the Soviet 37th Army to the east of the Desna River, in order to take a distance from the German Sixth Army and rotate its front line to the north, facing the advance of the Panzer Group 2.

== Sacrifice of the Soviet Southwestern Front ==
The Soviet Southwestern Front was defending a front line of more than 800 kilometers. On 11 September, Budyonny sent a telegram to Stalin stating that only powerful forces would be able to prevent the encirclement of this front, which the southwestern front currently lacked. He stated that if the Soviet high command did not provide the necessary reserve forces in this area, it would be necessary to pull back the southwestern front, and any delay in this matter would only cause loss of its forces and the destruction of a large number of supply units. Budyonny also requested permission to withdraw 250 kilometers eastward from the Dnieper River to the Pasel River. However, Stalin again ordered Kirponos not to abandon Kiev without Stavka&#x27;s permission and not to destroy the bridges. Stalin believed that if the Southwestern Front retreated from the Dnieper River line, the Germans would quickly gain a foothold on its eastern bank. As a result, the southwest front would be under the pressure of the enemy from three directions instead of two when retreating. In addition, if the Germans moved in a coordinated fashion, the Soviets would be surrounded, as it would not be possible to withdraw all 667,000 troops to behind the Pasel River. He considered the encirclement of the 6th and 12th Soviet armies in Uman as the consequence of attempting such a retreat, and that it should not be repeated. Stalin also did not consider the defenses on the Pasel River ready to use.

On 13 September, at the suggestion of Zhukov and by order of Stalin, Stavka replaced Budyonny with Marshal Semyon Timoshenko in command of the Soviet Southwestern direction without issuing a withdrawal authorization. Timoshenko, believing that reinforcements were on the way and the Bryansk Front&#x27;s counteroffensive would have good results, agreed for the Southwestern Front not to retreat. However, only one rifle division and two tank brigades with 100 tanks were provided to him, and it became clear that the Bryansk front lacked vital strength, with only 20 operational tanks in all its tank brigades.

== Completion of the encirclement ==
On 12 September, by transferring tank units from the 55th Army to the 13th Army, Stavka changed the attack plan of the Bryansk Front, and ordered Yeryomenko to stop his offensive along the Roslavl axis. Reorganizing his forces, he ordered for Guderian&#x27;s left wing to be targeted again to cover the created gap by the 18 September offensive, and to connect with the units of the southwestern front. To encourage Yeryomenko, Stavka promoted him to the rank of Colonel General and assigned some reinforcements to the disorganized Bryansk Front. After being delayed due to rain, the 16th Panzer Division of Army Group Center moved 20 kilometers from the Dnieper River bridgehead to the north, defeating the Soviet 297th Rifle Division. They reached Khorol, 230 kilometers southeast of Kiev, by evening. The division captured the headquarters of the Soviet 38th Army, but Feklenko, the commander of this army, managed to escape. The next day, 14th Panzer Division of Army Group Center reached Lubni, 30 kilometers north of Khorol. By attacking the supply lines of the Soviet Southwest Front, this division captured 1,500 soldiers, 600 trucks, 70 cannons, and 3 aircraft. The 9th Panzer Division was close behind the 16th and 14th divisions. These attacks by Kleist&#x27;s forces in the Panzer Group 1 created a gap of 20 kilometers between the Soviet 38th and 6th Armies, and placed them only 40 kilometers away from Generalmajor Walther Model&#x27;s forces in the 3rd Panzer Division of the Army Group Center in the north. At the same time, the resistance of the Red Army forces was increasing and a fierce air battle was underway. The 16th Panzer Division met the stubborn resistance of the NKVD elements in Lubny, and the advance of 3rd Panzer Division from Romny lasted two days. These problems caused the German Army High Command plan to connect two Panzer groups to one another on 13 September not to be realized.

A small battle group from the 3rd Panzer Division, consisting of three tanks, eight armored reconnaissance vehicles, six artillery pieces, and an anti-tank company, advanced southward and captured the city of Lukhvitsa and its bridge over the Sula River. Due to the lack of strength in this location, Guderian requested that infantry take place of the 18th Panzer Division, which was currently was holding a 90-kilometer line, in the northern part of his eastern flank, so that the Panzer division could move towards Romny. The command of the army group opposed this request due to the distance of this division from the intended target, and wanting to suffer minimum attrition before the upcoming attack against Moscow.

In the early morning of 14 September, Major General Vasily Tupikov, the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Southwestern Front, sent a personal telegram to Shaposhnikov that stated: &quot;The disaster has begun and will show itself to you in a few days&quot;. In a sharp response, Shaposhnikov described Tupikov as &quot;panicky&quot; and called for &quot;calmness and not to yield to panic&quot; at all levels of command and to stop the retreat of the Soviet 21st and 5th Armies. He asked the forces of the Soviet Southwestern Front &quot;not look backwards&quot; and to &quot;fulfil comrade Stalin&#x27;s order of September ll&quot;. On 15 September, under pressure, Timoshenko completely reversed his previous opinion and told Shaposhnikov in Moscow that he wanted the immediate withdrawal of the Soviet Southwestern Front. Meanwhile, with the pressure of the German 6th and 2nd armies, the northern wing of the Soviet southwestern front was gradually collapsing. The German 17th army also slowly began to advance from the Kremenchuk bridgehead to the north. The XI Army Corps of the German 17th Army with three infantry divisions was placed under the command of the Panzer Group 1 on 13 September, to ensure the protection of the eastern flank of the encirclement that was being completed.

At 18:00 on 14 September, a small battle group of the 18th Panzer Division reached an engineer company of the 16th Panzer Division north of Lubny. However, this meeting between the first vanguard elements of the northern and southern pincers was symbolic, and there was still a relatively large space between the body of the two pincers. The next day, more units of the 9th Panzer Division continued moving north to establish a stronger connection. On 16 September, with the complete connection of the 3rd and 16th Panzer Divisions, the armored spearheads of the Panzer Groups 1 and 2, in the south of Lukhvitsa, the encirclement ring was completed 120 kilometers southeast of Kiev, such that all the Soviet Southwestern Front, including the five Armies, 5th, 21st, 26th, 37th and 38th, were trapped inside it. The encirclement ring was formed on the eastern side by Panzer groups 1 and 2, and on the western side by the German 2nd and 6th armies. The encirclement included a large region with an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers, 200 kilometers from the connection point of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Panzer forces to the city of Kiev, east to west.

== Attempted Soviet retreat ==
On 16 September in Poltava, in a meeting with General Bagramian, the chief of operations of the Southwestern Front, Timoshenko stated that when the encirclement ring of the Germans is not yet tight, a decision should be made without delay to allow the Southwestern Front to retreat. Timoshenko stated that the High Command will eventually make this decision, but there is no time to waste in receiving confirmation from Moscow. According to Bagramian&#x27;s memoirs, taking into account the tone of Shaposhnikov&#x27;s previous telegram, Timoshenko himself deeply doubted the truth of this opinion. Timoshenko ordered Bagramian to fly to Priyatin and verbally order Kirponos to &quot;abandon the Kiev fortification area and, leaving the covering forces on the Dnieper River, immediately begin withdrawing the main body of forces to the defensive rear line (the Psel River).&quot; Kirponos was also ordered to carry out counter-attacks in Lubny and Rumny areas to slow down the Panzers as much as possible. Timoshenko, who did not have the authority to issue such an order contrary to Stalin&#x27;s wishes, refused to give Bagramian a written document in this regard, under the pretext that this flight could be too dangerous and such important orders should not fall into the hands of the enemy. In addition, leaving a written record of such disobedience to Stalin could have cost both their lives. However, after Bagramian delivered Timoshenko&#x27;s verbal order to the commander of the Soviet Southwestern Front on September 17, Kirponos avoided implementing it until reception of written confirmation. Ignoring Bagramian&#x27;s protests, he had decided to send a telegram to Moscow to receive the confirmation.

On the same day, Shaposhnikov and Vasilevsky &quot;in a difficult conversation&quot; were once again trying to convince Stalin to withdraw Kirponos&#x27; forces; Stalin accused the commanders of the Red Army of &quot;weak resistance against the enemy&quot;, and agreed only with the withdrawal of the 5th and 37th armies to better defensive positions. Despite the breakdown in communications, Kirponos finally received a withdrawal confirmation from Shaposhnikov on the night of 17 September, but he was only allowed to leave Kiev without retreating all the way to the Psel river. However, a few hours before the arrival of this order, Kirponos, on his own initiative, ordered the Soviet 5th, 21st and 37th armies to attack to the east in order to break the Germans armored wall. The 38th and 40th armies, from outside the encircled area, were also tasked to protect the flanks by attacking Rumny and Lubny in the north and south, respectively. However, due to being under attack from all directions, it was not possible to carry out a coordinated retreat.

Many of the Red Army forces efforts to break out of encirclement were made in a chaotic and unplanned manner. Most of these efforts had no organization and were accompanied with heavy casualties. The attempts to break the encirclement were generally made by a mass of infantry with little artillery support. However, the numerical superiority was often high enough that their efforts were not always fruitless. The attack of the Red Army forces from the east on 18 September partially split the German defense and penetrated to one kilometer from Rumny. At this time, Rumny was the headquarters of Panzer Group 2. Against the attack of two tank brigades, two rifle divisions and one or two cavalry divisions of the Red Army, Guderian had only two battalions of the 10th Motorized Infantry Division and a few anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Air Force was able to gain local superiority, and targeted Rumny with its heavy bombers. Guderian requested help from the 14th Division of the Panzer Group 1 and ordered the transfer of a part of the SS &quot;Das Reich&quot; and 4th Panzer divisions from the inner ring to this location. The arrival of the SS division on 19 and 4 September Panzer launching a counterattack from the south prevented the loss of Rumny to the Soviets. Despite holding Rumny, Guderian moved his headquarters to Konotop.

Elsewhere, the encircled forces in the east of Piryatin launched a powerful attack against the positions of the German 35th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division and by defeating them, temporarily broke the German line. The Panzer regiment of the 9th Panzer Division covered this breach with a successful counterattack. On the morning of 21 September, the attacks of the Red Army against the center of the 239th Infantry Division of the German XI Army Corps front line, not only caused a deep breach, but also surrounded the German 372nd Infantry Regiment. Lieutenant General Joachim von Kurtzfleisch, commander of the XI Army Corps, ordered a small force to be sent to this point from three other directions. At the same time, another breakthrough was achieved, this time on the left flank of the German 125th division of this Corps. These breaches caused the front line of the units to be mixed up and created a confused situation for the forces of both armies; noting this, a German soldier wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Often one does not understand who is surrounded; Bolsheviks or us!&quot;.

== Destruction of the pocket ==
On 1 September, the Soviet Southwestern Front had 850,000 troops (including 90,000 reserves and rearguard units), 3,923 cannons and mortars, 114 tanks and 167 combat aircraft. The area included 452,700 troops, 2,642 cannons and mortars, and 64 tanks. The Luftwaffe had absolute air superiority over the region by employing the II and V Air Corps. Despite supply problems, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s air attacks caused significant damage to the encircled Soviet forces and disrupted their movements. The Luftwaffe 5th Air Corps carried out more than 1,400 sorties and dropped around 570,000 kilograms of bombs on the enemy between 12 and 21 September, causing the destruction of nearly 2,200 motor vehicles and 100 Soviet aircraft. The Luftwaffe only suffered 27 casualties and 17 aircraft shot down.

The Germans divided the encircled forces of the Soviet Southwestern Front into small isolated parts and destroyed them one by one by tightening the ring. The advance of the German 17th army to the east increased the distance between the besieged forces of the Soviet Southwestern Front and the rest of the Red army. The XLVIII Motorized Corps and 11th Panzer Group had not only kept the southern part of the eastern wall of the pocket, but also made the area more compact by attacking from the west. Simultaneously, the LI Army Corps of the German 6th army made a significant advance to the south against the scattered resistance of the northern flank of Kirponos. This Corps linked up with elements of the XXXIV Army Corps, which had gained a new frontline at Rezhishchev, south of Kiev, to cut the encircled area in half. The actions of the Germans caused great confusion among the forces of the Soviet Southwestern Front. The disconnect between the Red Army units deprived it of the ability to coordinate and send orders. On 18 September, the Soviet 21st Army headquarters personnel, including three generals, were captured by the 4th Panzer Division. The next day, the pocket was divided into three parts. The largest part was around Boryspol, south-east of Kiev, and consisted mainly of troops of the Soviet 37th Army. The other two major areas were a circular area west of Urzhitsa with the forces of the Soviet 26th Army, and the area between Priatin and Lukhvitsa with the remnants of the Soviet 5th and 26th Armies, commanded by Kirponos. The Soviet 5th and 21st armies was defeated by 23 September, and the Soviet 26th Army in the Orzhitsa region was defeated by 26 September. Small groups of Red Army soldiers were still scattered over a wide area, and some of these troops tried to escape in different ways, including in civilian clothes. Only about 15,000 managed to get out of the pocket by 2 October, including Vlasov, the commander of the 37th Army, Kostenko, the commander of the 26th Army, and Kuznetsov, the commander of the 21st Army, and Bagramian.

In addition to tactical and operational issues, for the security of the forces inside the city, the command of the German 6th Army decided that until the surrounding area of the Kiev was completely cleared of any form of resistance, the German troops were only allowed to stay in it with the written permission of its headquarters. At the same time, a decree was issued in connection with the control of depots and maintaining order in Kiev.

The battle for Kiev itself began on 16 September with the assault of the General-Lieutenant Hans von Obstfelder XXIX Army Corps of the German 6th Army. The 71st and 296th infantry divisions were at the front of this offensive, breaking through the Soviet defensive positions. They were assisted by the 95th Infantry Division and the 3rd Battalion of the 77th Sturmgeschütz Regiment. Inside the city, the Soviet government tried to encourage the defenders to continue their resistance by broadcasting Stalin&#x27;s speeches through loudspeakers. Kiev was captured by German forces on 19 September but the clashes over this city continued until 24 September. Before its capture, important materials were evacuated from Kiev and the railway lines were destroyed by the retreating Soviets.

On 19 September, the German 99th Light Division discovered explosive traps that had been placed in large buildings suitable for deploying troops and headquarters. Attempts were made to find and disarm these traps, but on 24 September, an explosion next to the main post office in a captured weapons and ammunition depot started a large fire that quickly spread. The firefighters of the Sachsen regiment were not able to extinguish the fire. In order to contain the fire, the 99th sapping Battalion and the demolition squads of the 71st and 99th Infantry Divisions cleared a large area as a fire break. The fire was finally extinguished on 29 September with the help of German soldiers, emergency units and other local and German firefighters. About 200 Germans died in the initial explosions or subsequent fires, and 10,000 to 25,000 civilians were left homeless. &quot;Partisans and Jews&quot; were accused to be responsible of these events. The headquarters of the 195th military administration was removed from Kiev and the responsibility of city administration was entrusted to the commander of the 113th infantry division. Following these events, a two-day massacre of 33,000 Jews in Babi Yar took place.

As a result of the battle in the Kiev region, four Soviet field armies including the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th armies with 43 divisions were completely destroyed. As a result of the fighting during September, according to official German reports, about 665,000 Red Army troops were captured, and 824 tanks, 418 anti-tank guns, and 3,000 artillery pieces were destroyed. However, the official history of the Soviet Union admits that the southwestern front had suffered heavy losses before the battle of Kiev, and claims that it is unlikely that the number of prisoners was more than 222,000. On the other hand, there are no clear statistics on the amount of casualties of the German units involved in the battle of Kiev, but the quoted reports indicate that the Wehrmacht suffered heavy losses.

The aerial blockade of the region was not completed and a number of senior Soviet commanders, including Budyonny, Timoshenko and Khrushchev, were able to escape by aircraft. By the evening of 20 September, Kirponos, together with the forces of the Soviet 5th Army, was able to reach Driukovshchyna, 15 kilometers southwest of Lukhovitsa. The Red Army column was attacked by the 3rd Panzer Division in this region. The Germans captured General Sotensky, the artillery commander of the Soviet 5th Army, and drove the enemy forces into the Shumikovo forests. Kirponos, Potapov, the commander of the Soviet Fifth Army, their staff officers and about 2,000 Soviet troops continued to fight for several more hours. Kirponos was leading his troops near the front line when he was seriously wounded in the left leg and taken deep into the forest. Shortly afterwards a mortar shell landed near him, killing him. With Kirponos killed, the remaining Soviet elements surrendered. Mykhailo Burmystenko, the commissar of the Soviet Southwestern Front, a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union Communist Party and the second secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, who died in this battle, was the highest-ranking Soviet communist leader who was killed during World War II.

== Consequences ==
The battle of Kiev can be considered an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, which caused more damage than the battles of Minsk and Smolensk. The counter-attacks of the Soviet Bryansk front to prevent these incidents were unsuccessful and caused the loss of about 100,000 soldiers and 140 tanks out of an initial 260,000 soldiers and 260 tanks. After these defeats, the Bryansk front was in a chaotic state, and less than three weeks later, when the Wehrmacht&#x27;s concentrated offensive towards Moscow began, it had only 200,000 troops to face it. With the Southwestern Front completely destroyed, the Soviets were forced to rebuild it from scratch and in order to fill the gap created in the south of the front line, transfer its forces from the central sector.

The victory in Kiev was considered one of the prerequisites for the advance of the Army Group Center. Once it was achieved, the German Army High Command and the Wehrmacht High Command (OKW), returned their focus to the central part of the front, and resumed their push to Moscow. With their success in the Kiev region, new hope was immediately created amongst German command about the success of this front. The destruction of the Soviet Southwestern Front opened the way for Army Group South to advance to the east of Ukraine without facing any resistance force. In addition, the large amount of equipment captured in the Kiev region enabled the Wehrmacht to advance without waiting for resupply. Finally, during the eight weeks that the Battle of Kiev was going on, Army Group Center had the opportunity to recover and strengthen its worn-out forces and improve their supply situation, and its infantry divisions were able to join the motorized forces at the front line in a relatively slow march to the east.

The battle of Kiev also delivered some positive results for the Soviet Union. Panzer Group 2&#x27;s southward advance to encircle the Soviet Southwestern Front delayed the German advance toward Moscow for a month, and this eventually dragged the Wehrmacht&#x27;s operations into winter which turned out to be costly. However, the Red army lost significant forces which could have been used for defending Moscow. In addition to dominating the vital economic lands of the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht was able to securing the southern flank of its Army Group Center, and deal a heavy blow to the Soviet Bryansk Axis forces, making their path towards Moscow smoother. Zhukov said about this: 

Beyond the operational issues, in the strategic dimension, this victory was popularised to try to convince Turkey to join the war on the Axis side, and convince Finland to participate more. In this way, Germany could also put Iran under pressure in the south, for which Britain and the Soviet Union had plans.

The damage caused to the German forces as a result of the explosive traps planted in the city of Kiev by the Soviets caused a change in the Wehrmacht&#x27;s approach to capturing large cities in the continuation of Operation Barbarossa. Hitler forbade accepting such risks again and conquering large fortified cities with direct attacks, especially without Panzer units; rather, it was decided that these cities should be left behind and besieged by artillery fire and air attacks. During the final attack on Moscow, on 7 October, Hitler used this strategy, and prohibited the entry of troops into these cities.

The encirclement of the Kiev region was the last successful major breakthrough of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Panzer forces over a long distance that the Germans were able to carry out in the Soviet Union.

==Civilian impact==
Despite the order for wholesale destruction of Kiev issued in the Supplement to Directive 34 from 12 August, the city was spared, to Hitler&#x27;s fury, as there had been no fighting within. The German troops, who occupied Kiev on 19 September, were surprised by a series of explosions from Soviet radio-mines in the city centre from 24 September onwards, the first of which also killed a number of local civilians reporting at the German Field Command to surrender outlawed items. The resulting fire, which was not put out until 29 September, offered the Nazi authorities a pretext to commence the mass murder of Jews in Babi Yar on the same day. As the city had not been razed, the German leadership launched the plan to starve it while officially attributing the food shortages to the consequences of Soviet economic policies. Ultimately the implementation of the Hunger Plan in occupied Kiev was restrained by the fears of an uprising behind the lines, and the city was only forcibly evacuated and subjected to widespread looting and burning during the German withdrawal in September–November 1943.

<doc id="1177284" wikidata="Q2120923" url="?curid=1177284" title="W3C Markup Validation Service">
<text>The Markup Validation Service is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check pre-HTML5 HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup against a document type definition (DTD). Markup validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages. However, it is not a complete measure of web standards conformance. Though W3C validation is important for browser compatibility and site usability, it has not been confirmed what effect it has on search engine optimization.

As HTML5 has removed the use of DTD in favor of a &quot;Living Standard&quot;, the traditional Markup Validation Service is not applicable to these formats. Validation is instead performed using an open-source &quot;Nu Validator&quot;, an instance of which is provided by W3C.

==History==
The Markup Validation Service began as &quot;The Kinder, Gentler HTML Validator&quot;, a project by Gerald Oskoboiny. It was developed to be a more intuitive version of the first online HTML validator written by Dan Connolly and Mark Gaither, which was announced on July 13, 1994.

In September 1997, Oskoboiny began working for the W3C, and on December 18, 1997, the W3C announced its &quot;W3C HTML Validator&quot; based upon his works. In November 2008, the W3C released the validator.nu HTML5 engine and the ability to check documents for conformance to HTML5.

W3C also offers validation tools for web technologies other than HTML/XHTML, such as CSS, XML schemas, and MathML.

==Browser accommodation==
Many major web browsers are often tolerant of certain types of error, and may display a document successfully even if it is not syntactically correct. Certain other XML documents can also be validated if they refer to an internal or external DTD.

==Limitations==
Mark-up validators cannot see the &quot;big picture&quot; on a web page, but they excel at picking up missed closing tags and other technicalities.

DTD-based validators are also limited in their ability to check attribute values according to many specification documents. For example, using an HTML 4.01 DOCTYPE, codice_1 is accepted as valid for the &quot;body&quot; element even though the value &quot;fffff&quot; is missing a preceding &#x27;#&#x27; character and contains only five (instead of six) hexadecimal digits. Also, for the &quot;img&quot; element, width=&quot;really wide&quot; is also accepted as valid. DTD-based validators are technically not able to test for these types of attribute value problems.

Pages may not display as intended in all browsers, even in the absence of validation errors and successful display in other browsers. The only way to ensure that pages always display as intended is to test them in all browsers expected to render them correctly.

==CSS validation==
While the W3C and other HTML and XHTML validators will assess pages coded in those formats, a separate validator like the W3C CSS validator can check that there are no errors in the associated Cascading Style Sheet. CSS validators apply current CSS standards to referenced CSS documents.

<text>Sikkim Congress (Revolutionary) was political party in the Indian state of Sikkim in 1979–1981. The president of the party was Ram Chandra Poudyal. In the state assembly elections of 1979, SCR(R) won eleven seats (of 32) and became the largest faction in the assembly. In total, the party received votes (20.58% of the votes in the state). The strength of the party did however decline when several assembly members crossed over to Sikkim Prajatantra Congress.

In the Lok Sabha elections of 1980, the SC(R) candidate won votes (22.59% of the votes in Sikkim).

<text>The 1970 United States Senate elections was an election for the United States Senate. It took place on November 3, with the 33 seats of Class 1 contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. These races occurred in the middle of Richard Nixon&#x27;s first term as president. The Democrats lost a net of three seats, while the Republicans and the Conservative Party of New York picked up one net seat each, and former Democrat Harry F. Byrd Jr. was re-elected as an independent.

This was the first time that Republicans gained Senate seats while losing House seats, which also occurred in 2018. This also occurred for Democrats in 1914, 1962, and 2022.

This was the most recent election in which a third party won a seat in the Senate until 2006. , this is also the most recent cycle in which Democrats won Senate elections in Utah and Wyoming, and the most recent in which Republicans won a Senate election in Hawaii.

Since the deaths of Lowell Weicker and James L. Buckley in 2023, this is the latest Senate election cycle where all first-elected members are deceased.

== Race summary ==

=== Special elections during the 91st Congress ===
In these special elections, the winner was seated during 1970 or before January 3, 1971; ordered by election date, then state.

=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1971; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 1 seats.

== Closest races ==
Fourteen races had a margin of victory under 10%:

== Alaska (special) ==


Republican Ted Stevens was appointed December 24, 1968 to finish the term of Democrat Bob Bartlett, who had died in office. The open primary was held August 25, 1970, in which Stevens received 40,411 votes (55.91%), Key received 29,459 votes (23.94%), State senator Joe Josephson received 12,730 votes (18.22%) and Fritz Singer (R) received 1,349 votes (1.93%). In the November 3, 1970 special election to finish the term, he ran against the Democratic Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives Wendell P. Kay. Stevens easily won with almost 60% of the vote.




== Arizona ==


Incumbent Republican Paul Fannin decided to run for re-election to a second term, running unopposed in the Republican primary. Fannin defeated Democratic businessman Sam Grossman in the general election.





== California ==
In 1964, Republican actor George Murphy defeated Democrat and Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, in a close contest with about 52% of the vote. Murphy faced a primary challenge from billionaire Norton Simon, who took nearly 33% of the vote in the Republican primary. Democrats nominated John V. Tunney after a close-fought contest between Tunney and Representative George Brown Jr.. 

In the general election, Murphy lost re-election to Tunney by nearly ten points. Murphy&#x27;s recent surgery and staunch support for the lingering Vietnam War worked against him, as did reports that he had continued to receive a salary from Technicolor after taking office. Tunney&#x27;s successful Senate race in 1970 was reportedly the inspiration for the 1972 Robert Redford film &quot;The Candidate&quot;.




== Connecticut==

Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr. defeated Democrat Joseph Duffey and incumbent Thomas J. Dodd who ran this time as an independent. Dodd entered the race at the last minute and split the Democratic vote, allowing Weicker to win with only 42% of the vote.



== Delaware ==
Republican John J. Williams was originally elected in 1946 to the U.S. Senate. Williams was easily re-elected three more times but decided to retire in 1971. Republican Representative William Roth faced Democrat potato farmer Jacob Zimmerman in the general election. Roth defeated Zimmerman by a landslide eighteen percentage points in the general election. He was re-elected in 1976, 1982, 1988, and 1994 before losing re-election to Democrat Tom Carper in 2000. This was despite the state trending Democratic; Roth himself served most of his tenure with future President Joe Biden. 

Four-term Republican John J. Williams decided to retire, rather than run for re-election. Republican William Roth easily defeated Democrat Jacob Zimmerman by a margin of eighteen percentage points, and went on to serve thirty years in the Senate.




== Florida ==


Incumbent Democrat Spessard Holland retired instead of seeking a fifth term. During the Democratic primary, former Governor C. Farris Bryant and State senator Lawton Chiles advanced to a run-off, having received more votes than Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Frederick H. Schultz, attorney Alcee Hastings, and State Representative Joel T. Daves, III. Chiles soundly defeated Bryant in the run-off election, scoring a major upset due to his comparatively small name recognition prior to the election. To acquire name recognition and media coverage, Chiles walked about across the state of Florida and was given the nickname &quot;Walkin&#x27; Lawton&quot;.

The Republican primary exposed an in-party feud between Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. and U.S. Representative William C. Cramer. In the election, Cramer handily defeated G. Harrold Carswell and body shop owner George Balmer; the former was a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge favored by Kirk and had been rejected as a Supreme Court of the United States nominee a few months prior to the primary. Chiles won the election by a relatively small margin of 7.8%, receiving 902,438 votes against Cramer&#x27;s 772,817 votes.

Incumbent Spessard Holland, who served in the Senate since 1946, decided to retire rather than seek a fifth term. Although the Democratic Party had dominated state elections since the Reconstruction Era, Claude R. Kirk Jr. and Edward Gurney, both Republicans, were elected senator and Governor in 1966 and 1968, respectively.










== Hawaii ==
Republican Hiram Fong had served as the inaugural Class 1 senator from the state of Hawaii since 1959. From the state&#x27;s admission into the union, voters tended to lean Democratic, and this trend only continued over time. Fong initially won election to each of his first two terms with 53% of the vote, but in 1970 he faced backlash from voters for his support of the Vietnam War. Cecil Heftel, owner of a radio conglomerate, won the Democratic nomination. 

Fong was narrowly re-elected over Heftel with 52% of the vote in what would prove to be the closest election of his career. This would ultimately mark the last time that Republicans won a U.S. Senate seat in the state of Hawaii or win more than 44% of the vote. 


== Illinois (special) ==


A special election was held to fill the remainder of the term of Republican Everett Dirksen, who had died in office. Republican Ralph Tyler Smith had been appointed to fill the seat after Dirksen&#x27;s death, and he lost the special election to Democrat Adlai Stevenson III.





== Indiana ==
Democrat Vance Hartke was first elected in 1958 over Republican Harold W. Handley with 56% of the vote. He won re-election in 1964 (a landslide year for Democrats) with a lower share of 54%. 

In 1970, he faced his closest contest to date against Republican Representative Richard L. Roudebush. Unlike voters in Hawaii, Indiana voters generally supported the Vietnam War, but Hartke opposed the war. This led Roudebush to run a close race that ultimately was decided after a recount. Hartke won by just about 4,200 votes. 

This would be Hartke&#x27;s last win in a U.S. Senate election. In 1976, he was defeated by Republican Richard Lugar. 


== Maine ==




== Maryland ==
In 1970, Republican J. Glenn Beall ran for re-election to a third term in the U.S. Senate but was defeated by Democrat Joseph Tydings in a landslide, 63-37%. Tydings ran for re-election to a second term in 1970. 

Republicans nominated Representative J. Glenn Beall Jr., the son of J. Glenn Beall. Tydings faced a primary challenge from segregationist George P. Mahoney but won with 53% of the vote. However, Republican Glenn Beall Jr. won the general election with nearly 51% of the vote to 48% for Tydings. He would serve just one term, losing in 1976 to Democrat Paul Sarbanes. 



== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy defeated his challengers. This was Kennedy&#x27;s first election run since the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Kennedy won 62.2%, down from 74.3% that he won in the previous election in 1964; this decrease was due to numerous factors including Chappaquiddick and a far more favorable environment for the Republicans than the Democratic landslide year of 1964.

The Republican nominee was Josiah Spaulding, a businessman and Republican leader in Massachusetts. He led a group of delegates at the 1968 Republican National Convention who unsuccessfully sought to nominate Nelson A. Rockefeller over Richard Nixon.

Other candidates were Lawrence Gilfedder (Socialist Labor) and Mark R. Shaw (Prohibition), a former Prohibition Party candidate for U.S. senator from Massachusetts in 1946, 1952, 1958, 1969, 1962, and 1966. He was the party&#x27;s candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 1948 and 1956. In 1964, he was the Prohibition Party&#x27;s candidate for vice-president of the United States.





== Michigan ==






== Minnesota ==


Incumbent Democrat Eugene McCarthy retired instead of seeking a third term. Former Democratic U.S. senator, Vice President and 1968 presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey defeated Republican U.S. Representative Clark MacGregor.








== Mississippi ==





== Missouri ==
Incumbent Democrat Stuart Symington was originally elected in 1952 over Republican James P. Kem with 54% of the vote. He won re-election in landslide victories with 66% of the vote in 1958 and 1964. He ran for a fourth term in 1970. 

Symington faced little primary opposition. Republican Missouri Attorney General John Danforth won the Republican primary. In the general election, Symington led in polling, but Danforth closed the gap during the campaign and ran closely against Symington. Symington defeated Danforth 51-48%. This would be Symington&#x27;s closest election to the U.S. Senate, and Danforth would succeed him in 1976, serving for three terms. 




== Montana ==


Democratic incumbent Mike Mansfield, the Senate Majority Leader who was first elected to the Senate in 1952, and was re-elected in 1958 and 1964, ran for re-election. Mansfield won the primary against several opponents, and advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by Harold E. Wallace, a sporting goods salesman and the Republican nominee. While his margin of victory decreased slightly from 1964, Mansfield still managed to defeat Wallace overwhelmingly, winning his fourth and (what would turn out to be his) final term in the Senate.








== Nebraska ==

The incumbent Republican Roman Hruska was re-elected.



== Nevada ==


Democrat Howard Cannon, the incumbent since 1959, won re-election to a third term over William Raggio, the Washoe County District Attorney.

In the Senate, Cannon was known as a moderate in the Democratic Party. He served as chairman of several committees, including the rules committee and the inaugural arrangements committee. Cannon was nearly defeated for re-election in 1964 by Republican Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt in one of the closest election in history. However, he became more popular over the next few years and defeated D.A. William Raggio, whose 1970 senate campaign began his long political career. Raggio ran for the Nevada Senate in 1972 and won. He then served there for decades to come.



== New Jersey ==





== New Mexico ==


Incumbent Democrat Joseph Montoya successfully ran for re-election to a second term, defeating Republican Anderson Carter.








== New York ==


Incumbent Republican Charles Goodell, who was recently appointed to the seat by Governor Nelson Rockefeller after senator Bobby Kennedy (D) was assassinated, ran for a full term, but was defeated by the Conservative Party of New York nominee James L. Buckley. Other candidates included: Richard Ottinger, U.S. Congressman (1965–1971, 1975–1985), Kevin P. McGovern, Paul O&#x27;Dwyer, Former New York City Council Member from Manhattan, Ted Sorensen, Former Advisor and Speechwriter to President John F. Kennedy, Richard D. McCarthy, U.S. Congressman (1965–1971).















== North Dakota ==


Incumbent Democratic-NPL Party Senator Quentin N. Burdick was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican candidate Thomas S. Kleppe, who later became the United States Secretary of the Interior.

Only Burdick filed as a Dem-NPLer, and the endorsed Republican candidate was Thomas S. Kleppe, who was finishing his second and final term as a Representative for North Dakota&#x27;s second congressional district. Burdick and Kleppe won the primary elections for their respective parties.

One independent candidate, Russell Kleppe, also filed before the deadline.



== Ohio ==

Democrat Stephen M. Young had served in the U.S. Senate since 1958 after defeating Republican John W. Bricker in a close election. Young was re-elected in 1964 over Republican Representative Robert Taft Jr., whose father Robert A. Taft represented Ohio in the U.S. Senate from 1939 until his death in 1953. Young opted to retire in 1971. 

Taft Jr. faced a tough primary challenge against Ohio governor Jim Rhodes. He won a bitterly-fought primary by just under 6,000 votes to advance to the general election. Democrat Howard Metzenbaum competed in an equally-competitive primary, defeating former astronaut John Glenn. Metzenbaum and Glenn would both later represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. 

Taft Jr. defeated Metzenbaum in a close election, taking nearly 50% of the vote to just above 47% for Metzenbaum. Metzenbaum would defeat Taft Jr. in a rematch election in 1976, serving until 1995 alongside Glenn. 





== Pennsylvania ==


Incumbent Republican Hugh Scott won re-election, defeating Democratic nominee State senator William Sesler.






== Rhode Island ==





== Tennessee ==

Republican Bill Brock defeated incumbent senator Albert Gore Sr.




== Texas ==


Incumbent Democrat Ralph Yarborough was defeated by former Representative Lloyd Bentsen in the Democratic primary. Bentsen then defeated Representative George H. W. Bush in the general election. When Bush was running for president in 1988, his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, selected Bentsen as his vice presidential running mate.




== Utah ==




== Vermont ==
Republican Winston L. Prouty was first elected in 1958, succeeding Republican Ralph Flanders. He was re-elected in 1964 in a realigning period for Vermont politics. Democrat Philip H. Hoff became the state&#x27;s first Democratic governor since 1853, while William H. Meyer succeeded Prouty in the House of Representatives. Prouty faced a more difficult challenge in 1964 and won with just 53% of the vote. 

In 1970, Prouty faced Hoff and Meyer in the general election, with Meyer nominated by the Liberty Union party. Prouty prevailed with 59% of the vote to 40% for Hoff and just 1% for Meyer. He would not serve the full term, as he died in 1971 and was succeeded by Republican Robert Stafford. 




== Virginia ==


Incumbent Harry F. Byrd Jr. was re-elected to his first full term after winning a race 4 years earlier to finish the remainder of his father&#x27;s term. He beat George C. Rawlings Jr. (D), a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and Ray L. Garland (R), a member of Virginia House of Delegates.

<text>Sikkim Ekta Manch (translation: &quot;Sikkim Unity Platform&quot;), was a political party in the Indian state of Sikkim founded in August 1997, when Laxmi Parasad Tiwari and T. M. Rai broke from the Indian National Congress (INC). The party drew dissident members from the ruling Sikkim Democratic Front and the INC, who claimed the new party would promote a Sikkim free of caste or communal based politics.

In the October 1997 panchayat (local) elections, the first local elections in Sikkim to allow political parties, the SEM criticised this &quot;politicization&quot; and only fielded independent candidates. 

Shortly thereafter, Rai broke away from the SEM to form the Sikkim Janshakti Party. 

In the 1998 general election SEM ran a joint candidate with Congress, the Sikkim Sangram Parishad and the Sikkim National Front for the state&#x27;s single Lok Sabha seat.

In November 1998 SEM merged with INC.

<text>Étienne François Geoffroy (13 February 16726 January 1731) was a French physician and chemist, best known for his 1718 affinity tables. He first contemplated a career as an apothecary, but then decided to practice medicine. He is sometimes known as &quot;Geoffroy the Elder&quot;.

== Biography ==

Geoffroy was born in Paris. After studying at Montpellier he accompanied Marshal Tallard on his embassy to London in 1698 and thence travelled to the Netherlands and Italy. Returning to Paris he became professor of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi and of pharmacy and medicine at the Collège Royal, and dean of the faculty of medicine. He died in Paris on 6 January 1731.

His brother Claude Joseph, known as Geoffroy the younger, was also a chemist.

== Works ==

His name is best known in connection with his tables of &quot;affinities&quot; (&quot;tables des rapports&quot;), which he presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1718 and 1720.

These were lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different reagents, and they retained their vogue for the rest of the century, until displaced by the profounder conceptions introduced by CL Berthollet.

Another of his papers dealt with the delusions of the philosopher&#x27;s stone, but nevertheless he believed that iron could be artificially formed in the combustion of vegetable matter. His &quot;Tractatus de materia medico&quot;, published posthumously in 1741, was long celebrated.

<text>Claude Joseph Geoffroy (8 August 1685, Paris – 9 March 1752, Paris) was the brother of Étienne François Geoffroy. Like his brother, he was an apothecary and chemist. Having a considerable knowledge of botany, he devoted himself especially to the study of the essential oils in plants.

The son of Matthieu François Geoffroy and Louise Devaux, he was born in Paris on 8 August 1685. In 1703 he became a master apothecary, and in 1704/05 took scientific excursions throughout southern France. He then studied botany under Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1707). In 1708, following the death of his father, he took charge of the family pharmacy. In May 1711 he was elected a member of the Académie Royale des Sciences (botany section), subsequently transferring to the &quot;chemistry section&quot; in 1715. From 1718 to 1720 he was &quot;Garde des marchands-apothicaires&quot; in Paris, then later served as &quot;inspecteur de pharmacie&quot; at the Hôtel-Dieu. In 1731 he attained the title of alderman in Paris.

From 1707 to 1751, he published numerous articles in the &quot;Histoire et Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie royale des sciences&quot;.

During 1729 Geoffroy used a method from Wilhelm Homberg “to determine the strength of vinegar by adding small amounts of potassium”, and this went to be the first ever titration recorded.

He is known as Geoffroy the Younger to distinguish him from his brother, Geoffroy the Elder (1672–1731). However, this leads to confusion with his son, Claude François Geoffroy (1729–1753), who is known as &quot;Claude Geoffroy the Younger&quot;.

<text>Timms Hill or Timm&#x27;s Hill is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and is located in north-central Wisconsin in Timms Hill County Park in the Town of Hill in Price County. After being surveyed by Quentin Stevens of Ogema Telephone Co in 1962, Timms Hill was discovered to have an elevation of . It is less than south of Highway 86, about midway between Ogema and Spirit and about west of Tomahawk.

== Description ==
Timms Hill is located in Timms Hill County Park. A public lookout tower is atop the hill. Visible to the southeast is Rib Mountain (elev. 1,924 ft, 586 m), 44 miles away by line of sight. The Timms Hill Trail connects to the Ice Age Trail, a National Scenic Trail stretching across glacial terrain in Wisconsin.

<doc id="1177322" wikidata="Q6828705" url="?curid=1177322" title="Michael Bluth">
<text>Nichael &quot;Michael&quot; Bluth is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American television sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, created by Mitchell Hurwitz, and portrayed by Jason Bateman. Michael serves as the series straight man, and leads his family through its many crises.

==Character history==
Michael (born December 14, 1967) is the second oldest Bluth son, and the father of George Michael Bluth. He has an older brother, Gob (pronounced like the biblical character Job), a younger half-brother, Buster, and a twin sister, Lindsay (she is later revealed to be adopted and older than Michael). He also has an adopted Korean brother named Annyong, who is almost 20 years younger.

When his father George Sr. goes to jail, Michael becomes head of the family and CEO and President of the Bluth Company. His authority, however, is constantly undermined by his family. He remained President for all of Season 1, but was replaced by Gob. in Season 2. As Vice President, Michael was the Bluth Company&#x27;s de facto head, doing all the work of the President while being scrutinized by the SEC for his father&#x27;s crimes. In Season 3, Michael was firmly in charge again, though the sibling rivalry and family interference did not totally recede.

Michael is the most functional and level-headed Bluth, but can occasionally be dishonest and selfish. He is usually the only source of stability for his family, much to his chagrin. Despite this, he has a problem letting go of control, and tends not to listen to his son&#x27;s feelings when making decisions for him. He is especially critical of George Michael&#x27;s girlfriend, Ann, often forgetting her name, and frequently referring to her as any number of random, only loosely appropriate monikers, including &quot;Egg&quot;, &quot;Bland&quot;, &quot;Plant&quot;, &quot;Yam&quot;, and (with thinly-veiled disappointment and raised eyebrows) &quot;Her?&quot; He often threatens to leave the family out of frustration.

Michael&#x27;s wife Tracy died (presumably of ovarian cancer) two years prior to the first season, and she was in a coma for some months before she passed. In the show, Michael is often reluctant to date, thinking that his son would disapprove, and most of his relationships have featured misunderstandings or outright deception. His wife&#x27;s death is usually the subject of tasteless and unaware jokes made by his family members.

In season 3, it is revealed that there is a typo on his birth certificate and that his legal name is Nichael Bluth. Also, Michael discovers the truth about his father&#x27;s crimes and his sister&#x27;s identity. In the last episode, Michael and his son George Michael try once more to abandon the Bluth family by sailing away on a yacht, but after they arrive at the new home, they find that George Sr. was also on the yacht.

In season 4, Michael&#x27;s fortunes decline swiftly and he becomes more petulant, narcissistic, and guile as he avoids a massive debt to Lucille Austero, manipulates his family into signing away their movie portrayal rights, and allows his relationship with George Michael to deteriorate by encroaching on his privacy, petulantly avoiding him, and carrying on a relationship with the same woman as his son.

Michael is the only character who has appeared in every episode of the series.

==Development==
Michael is generally the straight man in the series. However, creator Mitch Hurwitz says that in some respects Michael is &quot;the craziest one&quot; in that he cannot see much of what happens around him.

Michael is portrayed by actor Jason Bateman. Hurwitz did not know if Bateman was right for the part as he seemed associated with more conventional sitcoms, but Hurwitz said that in trying out for the part, Bateman &quot;gave this dry, confident performance&quot;. Bateman also explained his performance by saying he could be &quot;naturally... dickish&quot; like his character. Bateman said of his part, &quot;it&#x27;s the best job I&#x27;ve ever had, hands down,&quot; and it may have also been his most famous one.

==Reception==
Bateman and his character were well received by critic Robert Bianco, who wrote &quot;the key to the show&#x27;s success is the hilariously deadpan Bateman&quot;.

Bateman was nominated for seven individual awards for his portrayal of Michael Bluth, winning three. In 2004, Bateman was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2004 and again in 2005, he was nominated for a Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy. In 2005, Bateman was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Bateman won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy and the 2005 Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, which he won again in 2006. On July 18, 2013, Bateman was nominated again for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Michael Bluth.

<doc id="1177323" wikidata="Q1537376" url="?curid=1177323" title="Grave robbery">
<text>Grave robbery, tomb robbing, or tomb raiding is the act of uncovering a grave, tomb or crypt to steal commodities. It is usually perpetrated to take and profit from valuable artefacts or personal property. A related act is body snatching, a term denoting the contested or unlawful taking of a body (usually from a grave), which can be extended to the unlawful taking of organs alone.

Grave robbing has caused great difficulty to the studies of archaeology, art history, and history. Countless precious grave sites and tombs have been robbed before scholars were able to examine them. In any way, the archaeological context and the historical and anthropological information are destroyed:
Grave robbers who are not caught usually sell relatively modern items anonymously and artifacts on the black market. Those intercepted, in a public justice domain, are inclined to deny their guilt. Though some artifacts may make their way to museums or scholars, the majority end up in private collections.

==Effects on archaeology around the world==

===China===
Grave robbing in China is a practice stretching back to antiquity; the classic Chinese text &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, dating to the 2nd century BCE, advised readers to plan simple burials to discourage looting. The presence of jade burial suits and other valuables in tombs were powerful temptations to rob graves.

In modern China, grave robbing has been perpetrated by both amateurs (such as farmers and migrant laborers) and by professional thieves associated with transnational criminal networks. The practice reached epidemic proportions in the 1980s, as the development and construction boom following the Chinese economic reform led to many archaeological sites being revealed. Other peaks of tomb robbing occurred in the early 2000s and in the 2010s, when the plunder of graves was on the upswing due to an increase in global and domestic demand (and prices) for Chinese antiquities. The provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi were particularly affected by tomb robbing.

===Egypt===

Ancient Egyptian tombs are one of the most common examples of tomb or grave robbery. Most of the tombs in Egypt&#x27;s Valley of the Kings were robbed within one hundred years of their sealing (including the tomb of the famous King Tutankhamen, which was raided at least twice before it was discovered in 1922). As most of the artifacts in these ancient burial sites have been discovered, it is through the conditions of the tombs and presumed articles that are missing in which historians and archaeologists are able to determine whether the tomb has been robbed. Egyptian pharaohs often kept records of the precious items in their tombs, so an inventory check is presumed for archaeologists. Oftentimes, warnings would be left by the Pharaohs in the tombs of calamities and curses that would be laid upon any who touched the treasure, or the bodies, which did little to deter grave robbers. There are many examples of grave robbing in the Ancient World outside of Egypt.

===Classical Antiquity===

The Romans (Byzantium) also suffered decades of theft and destruction of tombs, crypts, and graves.

=== Europe ===
In parts of Europe, graves are robbed on an accelerating and alarming scale. Many grave robbers work with metal detectors and some of the groups are organised criminals, feeding the black market with highly prized archaeological artifacts.

Merovingian graves in France and Germany and Anglo-Saxon graves in England contain many metal grave goods, mostly of iron. Grave robbers often leave them, being only interested in gold and silver. Grave contexts, ceramics, iron weapons and skeletons are typically destroyed in the process.

In Eastern Europe, including Southeast Europe and the European part of Russia, grave robbers target all kinds of historically important graves, from prehistoric tombs to World War II graves.

===North America===
Modern grave robbing in North America also involves long-abandoned or forgotten private Antebellum Period to pre-Great Depression era grave sites. These sites are often desecrated by grave robbers in search of old and valuable jewellery. Affected sites are typically in rural, forested areas where once-prominent, wealthy landowners and their families were interred. The remote and often undocumented locations of defunct private cemeteries make them particularly susceptible to grave robbery. The practice may be encouraged by default upon the discovery of a previously unknown family cemetery by a new landowner.

One notable historical incident occurred during the evening of November 7, 1876, when a group of counterfeiters attempted to steal Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s body from his grave in Springfield, Illinois, in an attempt to secure the release of their imprisoned leader, counterfeit engraver Benjamin Boyd. However, a Secret Service agent was present and had notified the police beforehand, so the grave robbers only succeeded in dislodging the lid of his coffin. As a consequence, when Lincoln was reburied, additional security measures were implemented to prevent further grave robbery attempts.

===Central America===
Grave robbers often sold stolen Aztec or Mayan goods on the black market for an extremely high price. The buyers (museum curators, historians, etc.) didn&#x27;t often suffer the repercussions of being in possession of stolen goods; the blame (and charges) were placed upon the lower-class grave robbers. Today&#x27;s antiquities trade has become a streamlined industry, the speed at which these artifacts enter the market has grown exponentially. Laws to prevent grave robbing have been enacted in these regions, but due to extreme poverty, these grave robberies continue to grow each year.

==Minorities==

===African Americans===

African Americans would often be compelled to bury their dead in a potter&#x27;s field, not having the access or money for a proper funeral. When buried in potter&#x27;s fields, the dead were not normally buried very deeply. A grave robber could wait discreetly in the distance until nobody else was in sight, then quickly and easily disinter the body from its shallow resting place.

Once the railroad was invented and tracks laid, the sale of the bodies of African American slaves from the South for dissection began in earnest. The bodies were robbed from graves by night doctors and shipped to medical schools in the northern part of the United States. One New England anatomy professor reported that, in the 1880s and 1890s, he entered into an arrangement in which he received, twice each semester, a shipment of 12 bodies of southern African Americans. &quot;They came in barrels labeled [as containing] turpentine and were shipped to a local hardware store that dealt in painting materials&quot;.

State laws in Mississippi and North Carolina were passed in the 19th century which allowed medical schools to use the remains of those at the bottom of society&#x27;s hierarchy—the unclaimed bodies of poor persons and residents of almshouses, and those buried in potter&#x27;s fields for anatomical study. The option to dissect Confederate soldiers was also available, as Mississippi and North Carolina legally released those bodies to the families of the deceased. The North Carolina law also provided that the bodies of whites never be sent to an African American medical college (such as the Leonard Medical School). These African American medical schools typically obtained unclaimed Black ‘‘potter’s field bodies’’.

=== Australia ===

The practice of grave robbery against Aboriginal Australians can be traced back to the early days of British colonisation, when Aboriginal burial sites were viewed merely as sites of scientific curiosity and anthropological study, and sought to collect and study their remains before they disappeared altogether.

This belief was reflected in the work of anthropologists and scientists who travelled to Australia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to collect Aboriginal remains for study. These remains were not only taken without the consent of Indigenous communities but were used to advance racist and pseudoscientific theories about their supposed inferiority.

It was a common practice carried out by medical students who needed corpses for dissection and research. This practice continued until the late nineteenth century when laws were introduced to regulate the supply of cadavers for medical research.

This was all part of a broader pattern of colonial violence against Indigenous Australians, which included forced removal from their land, massacres, and the forced assimilation of Indigenous children into white Australian society.

One of the most notorious examples of grave robbery in Australia is the case of the Tasmanian Aboriginals (see also: Black War). After the last full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal woman died in 1876, her body was exhumed and her skeleton sent to the Royal College of Surgeons in London for study. It was not until 1976, a century later, that her remains were finally returned to Australia for a proper burial.

Probably the most prolific documented individual pillager of Indigenous burial sites was George Murray Black, who ransacked around 1,800 graves around Victoria, eastern South Australia and southern New South Wales. 

The practice continued well into the twentieth century, with some cases reported as recently as the 1970s. The theft and desecration of Aboriginal burial sites and remains has had profound and ongoing impacts on Indigenous communities in Australia. For many Indigenous Australians, the loss of their ancestors&#x27; remains has denied them the opportunity to mourn and grieve their loved ones. It has also perpetuated a legacy of trauma and dispossession that has been passed down through the generations.

Efforts to repatriate stolen Indigenous remains and protect Indigenous burial sites have been ongoing in Australia for many years. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to return stolen remains to their traditional owners for proper burial and commemoration.

== Deterrents ==

=== Geography ===

The geography and placement of burial grounds became a deterrent within itself. This is because without the accessibility of the automobile (in the early 19th century), the transportation of bodies was difficult.

An example of this is Mount Auburn Cemetery, in Cambridge Massachusetts. It was the first rural cemetery inside the United States. The rural location of the cemetery created transportation issues. In addition, the terrain of and around the area was formidable, as the designer, Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn, wanted to leave the natural terrain (including ponds and hills) within the cemetery. If someone wanted to rob a grave, they would have to maneuver around these obstacles and navigate large stretches of land in the dark. Note that Mount Auburn Cemetery is over 175 acres. Other cemeteries, of the time, that were originally built away from populated areas for similar reasons, include: Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, Maine (1834); Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1836); Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Taunton, Massachusetts (1836); Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York (1838); Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York (1838); and, Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland (1838).

===Mortsafes===

A mortsafe or mort safe was an iron coffin or framework which helped to protect a grave by preventing the body from being dug up and taken away. Mortsafes were specific for the task of preventing bodies from being stolen for purposes of medical dissections. Other variants included movable stone slabs capable of being hoisted over the fresh grave. All work on the principle of greatly increasing the required time for criminals to access the grave.

These deterrents, used commonly in Scotland, would be rented from the sexton until the body decomposed and were used on a circulating basis. At the passage of the Dissections Act the purpose became redundant and they were left where last used, sometimes being incorporated into the grave marker by addition of inscription.

===Mort houses===
A mort house, ossuaries or dead house was used to store bones (usually skulls and femurs) gleaned from graves a year or two after burial. They are common throughout northern Europe. They usually predate any graverobbing periods and indeed serve no purpose in relation to graverobbing as they stored bones not bodies.

Up to 31 recorded mort houses were scattered throughout Scotland and northern England. Usually these structures were built within or near cemeteries to make transportation easier. Prior to grave robbers, they were used to store dead bodies in the winter, being that the ground was too cold and in some cases impossible to dig into. An example is the Udny Mort House built in 1832, Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland and still standing today.

===Coffin collars===
The coffin collar was an iron collar often fixed to a piece of wood. It was fixed around the neck of a corpse and then bolted to the bottom of a coffin. Most common reports of these collars being used came from Scotland around the 1820s.

===Family mausoleums===

Mausolea do not play a major role in the history of graverobbing and are largely built as a display of wealth rather than security.

Historically mausoleums have been used as a sign of a family&#x27;s wealth and a symbol of gentry and nobility in many countries. In the mid and late 19th century in North America, more and more families began to buy mausoleums. The belief was that it would be easier for a Resurrectionist or grave robber to dig up a grave rather than to topple down iron or steel doors guarding the mausoleum. A flaw in the design of the mausoleum was the stained glass or other windows within. Almost every family between the 18th and 19th century had a religious affiliation. Many of these families (usually with a Christian affiliation) would put stained glass within the mausoleums. The grave robbers would then just have to smash the glass to break in and to retrieve the body. Making it even easier, around the 1830s families began to fear burying family members alive. To remedy this, families would put a spare key somewhere within the mausoleum and create doors with two way locks. Grave robbers could break a window, recover the body, find the key, and walk straight out the front door of the mausoleum.

===Cemetery vaults===
Unlike mausolea, cemetery vaults did play a functional role in protection against graverobbing. These feature strongly in French and British layouts. Typically these would be a semi-enclosed stone structure with an ornamental cast iron access gate and usually plainer rails to the roof or sides.

Although the protective function of the vaults became redundant by 1840 most mid 19th century cemeteries continue to include vaults as a visual focal point in their layouts. This is often a critical point within overall composition.

===Guards and guarding===
One of the most simplistic and low-tech methods to prevent grave robbing were to have an individual guard over the newly buried body. This was done until decomposition of the body was brought to a point where they would no longer be desirable for medical use. If families did not have enough money to hire an individual to watch over the grave for a select number of days, the family would delegate this duty amongst them and close friends. As grave robbing became a lucrative business in the 19th century, a bribe would convince some guards to look the other way.

In Scotland, construction of guard towers became common in the late 18th century, usually in a position overlooking most of the burial ground.

===Deception===
Within the Great Pyramid of Giza (completed around 2560 BC), an Egyptian deterrent system was built to guard the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu. This system consists of blocks and grooves to protect the King&#x27;s Chamber from tomb robbers. Some experts believe that Pharaoh Khufu&#x27;s tomb has actually not been found because of the deterrent system; instead, what had been found by grave robbers were fake chambers.

<text>Ferdinand Berthoud (; born 18 March 1727, in Plancemont-sur-Couvet, Principality of Neuchâtel; died 20 June 1807, in Groslay, Val d&#x27;Oise), was a scientist and watchmaker. He became master watchmaker in Paris in 1753. Berthoud, who held the position of Horologist-Mechanic by appointment to the King and the Navy, left behind him an exceptionally broad body of work, in particular in the field of marine chronometers.

== History ==

Ferdinand Berthoud was born on 18 March 1727, in Plancemont, Val-de-Travers, in the Principality of Neuchâtel, which then belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia, into a distinguished family of watch and clock makers.

His father, Jean Berthoud, was a master carpenter and architect. He was a burgher of Couvet, burgher of Neuchâtel, and justice of the peace for Val-de-Travers from 1717 to 1732. His mother, Judith Berthoud (1682–1765) was born in Couvet.

Ferdinand had four brothers: Abraham (1708-?); Jean-Henry (1710–1790), justice of the peace for Val-de-Travers, clerk of the court in Les Verrières, barrister in Cressier, and an expert watchmaker and clockmaker; Jean-Jacques (1711–1784), a draughtsman, and Pierre (1717-?), a farmer and clockmaker. Pierre was a councillor in Couvet, and married Marguerite Borel-Jaquet in 1741. With her, Pierre had two sons, Pierre Louis (born in Paris in 1754, died 1813), and Henri (born ? in Paris, died in 1783); their career was to be closely linked to that of their uncle Ferdinand Berthoud.

Ferdinand also had two sisters: Jeanne-Marie (1711–1804) and Suzanne-Marie (1729-?).

In 1741, when he was fourteen, Ferdinand Berthoud became clockmaking apprentice to his brother Jean-Henry in Couvet, at the same time receiving a sound scientific education. On 13 April 1745, Ferdinand Berthoud finished his training and was awarded a watchmaking and clockmaking apprenticeship certificate.

In 1745, aged 18, Ferdinand Berthoud moved to Paris to improve his skills as a watchmaker and clockmaker. He exercised his talents as a journeyman, working with master watchmakers in the Paris community. There is some suggestion in the literature that Ferdinand Berthoud worked for a time for Julien Le Roy, where he is said to have made strikingly swift progress, alongside Pierre Le Roy, his master&#x27;s son, who later became his rival.

On 4 December 1753, by order of the French Royal Council, in an exception to guild rules and by special favour of the King, Ferdinand Berthoud became a master at the age of 26, receiving the official title of Master Watchmaker.

From 1755 onwards, Ferdinand Berthoud was entrusted with the task of writing a number of reference articles on watchmaking for the &quot;Encyclopédie méthodique&quot;1&quot;,&quot; published between 1751 and 1772 under the direction of the writer and philosopher Diderot (1713–1784) and the mathematician and philosopher d&#x27;Alembert (1717–1783).

Ferdinand Berthoud published his first specialist work in 1759, &quot;L&#x27;Art de conduire et de régler les pendules et les montres, à l&#x27;usage de ceux qui n&#x27;ont aucune connaissance d&#x27;horlogerie&quot;1 [1]. Several other written works followed, detailed in the &quot;Works&quot; section.
In 1763, Ferdinand Berthoud was appointed by the King to inspect the H4 sea watch made by John Harrison (1693–1776) in London, in the company of mathematician Charles-Etienne Camus (1699–1768), a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences, and astronomer Joseph-Jérôme Lefrancois de La Lande (1732–1807). It was a disappointing trip for Berthoud: Harrison only showed him his H1, H2, and H3 watches (in exchange for a payment of £500), categorically refusing to show him the legendary H4, the most advanced of them all.

Although Berthoud was not able to see Harrison&#x27;s famous H4 in London, his trip did offer him a way into English scientific circles, due to the importance of his works and publications in the field of watchmaking. This resulted in him being elected on 16 February 1764 as an &quot;associate foreign member&quot; of the Royal Society in London.

In 1764, by order of the King, the French Academy instructed two of its members, Duhamel de Monceau and Jean-Baptiste Chappe d&#x27;Auteroche, to test Ferdinand Berthoud&#x27;s number 3 sea watch at sea. Berthoud reported that he wore the watch personally in Brest and was present for the tests. The trials took place on the frigate &quot;L&#x27;Hirondelle&quot;.

In 1765, Ferdinand Berthoud undertook a second trip to London to meet Harrison through the offices of Count Heinrich von Brühl (1700–1763), Minister of Saxony. Harrison once again refused to present his creations to Berthoud, knowing that he was fully capable of using them to benefit the French Navy. It was the English horologist Thomas Mudge (1715–1795), famous for his development of the first detached lever escapement and a member of the Board of Longitude, who described the working principle of the H4 watch to Berthoud, without him being able to see it for himself (Harrison demanded a payment of £4,000 for a description of his watch, an exorbitant and dissuasive amount).

On 7 May 1766, Ferdinand Berthoud sent a paper to the Duke of Praslin (1712–1785), Count of Choiseul, Minister of the Navy, explaining his plan to build the Number 6 and Number 8 Sea Clocks. He asked him for an allowance of £3,000 in consideration of his work on earlier sea clocks and in anticipation of his estimated costs for the production of two new sea clocks using English technology. The paper clearly set out Ferdinand Berthoud&#x27;s ambitions to receive this allowance, together with the title of Horologist-Mechanic by appointment to the King and the Navy, and to devote himself to developing sea clocks and determining longitude at sea. On 24 July 1766, the King approved the project to build the two sea clocks and agreed to finance it.-

To check the performance of the new sea watches, on 3 November 1768, the Duke of Praslin gave Sea Clocks numbers 6 and 8 to Charles-Pierre Claret, the &#x27;Knight of Fleurieu&#x27; (1738–1810), explorer, hydrographer, and King&#x27;s lieutenant, accompanied by Canon Pingré (1711–1796), navy astronomer and geographer and member of France&#x27;s Royal Academy of Sciences. Their mission was to test the watches on the corvette &quot;Isis&quot; during a voyage from Rochefort to Santo Domingo and back. The voyage lasted ten months and the trials on the clocks were successful. The findings of Charles-Pierre Claret were published in 1773 under the title &quot;Voyage fait par ordre du roi, pour éprouver les horloges marines&quot;.

In 1769, Ferdinand Berthoud sent for his nephew Pierre-Louis Berthoud (1754–1813), commonly known as Louis Berthoud, a talented young watchmaker and clockmaker, inviting him to come to Paris from Couvet, Switzerland, to pursue his apprenticeship. Louis helped Ferdinand manufacture and repair the sea clocks his uncle supplied to the French and Spanish navies.

On 1 April 1770, following the successful sea trials of Sea Watches numbers 6 and 8, Ferdinand Berthoud received the title of Horologist-Mechanic by appointment to the King and the Navy, with an annual allowance of £3,000 and responsibility for inspecting the construction of sea clocks. He received a royal commission for 20 sea clocks.

Ferdinand Berthoud&#x27;s clocks soon became a success and were used on board ship for various test campaigns and charting voyages.

In 1771, Borda boarded the frigate &quot;Flore&quot;, under Lieutenant Verdun de la Crenne, for a campaign of tests on sea chronometers, sailing from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean. Count Chastenet de Puységur (1752–1809), captain of the corvette &quot;Espiègle&quot;, accompanied Borda, captain of &quot;Boussole&quot;, in an expedition to the Canaries and the coast of Africa in 1774 and 1775.

On 1 August 1785, Ferdinand Berthoud gave five clocks to the captain of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;, Lapérouse, as he was leaving on an expedition around the world with the aim of adding to the discoveries of James Cook in the Pacific Ocean. The clocks taken on board were lost at sea in the wreck of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; in 1788 off the coast of Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands, near the Solomon Islands.

In 1791, Berthoud supplied four marine chronometers to Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux, to aid his expedition to search for Lapérouse with the frigates &quot;Recherche&quot; and &quot;Espérance&quot;.

In 17951, Berthoud was elected First Class Resident Member of the Mechanical Arts section of France&#x27;s National Institute (&quot;Institut de France&quot;). Following the French Revolution, Berthoud moved in to the Louvre and received an allowance from the State, continuing to work on his clocks and maintain sea clocks. His most important priority, however, was the publication of his most significant work: &quot;Histoire de la Mesure du temps&quot;2 (1802).

On 17 July 1804, Napoleon made Berthoud a Knight of the Legion of Honour, as a member of the institute.

On 20 June 1807, Ferdinand Berthoud died childless at the age of 80. He was buried in Groslay, in the Montmorency Valley (Val d&#x27;Oise), where a monument commemorates him.

== Works ==

In 1752 at the age of 25, seven years after he arrived in Paris, Ferdinand Berthoud submitted an equation clock to the Royal Academy of Sciences, thus demonstrating his extraordinary proficiency in the art of watchmaking4]. French Academy members Charles Étienne Camus (1699–1768), a mathematician and astronomer, and Pierre Boger (1698–1758), a mathematician, physicist, and famous hydrographer, wrote a glowing report on the quality of his work.-

Ferdinand Berthoud filed various sealed envelopes with the French Royal Academy of Sciences. On 20 November 1754, he filed the plan for a Machine for measuring time at sea, in a sealed envelope that was never published[5]. This was his first plan for a sea clock. The envelope was not opened until 1976 by the President of the academy.

On 13 December 1760, Ferdinand Berthoud filed his &quot;Mémoire sur les principes de construction d&#x27;une Horloge de Marine&quot;1 with the French Royal Academy of Sciences to present his legendary Sea Clock Number 1, the construction of which was completed in early 1761. He filed an addendum on 28 February 1761. The clock was displayed in April 1763 at the Royal Academy of Sciences.-

In 1754, the French Academy of Sciences approved a watch and equation clock by Ferdinand Berthoud.-

Ferdinand Berthoud devoted himself to research and passing on his knowledge through his publications. This twofold aim earned him rapid acceptance in the scientific circles of his day. Several articles in the &quot;Encyclopédie méthodique,&quot; published in 1751–1772, under the direction of Diderot (1713–1784) and d&#x27;Alembert (1717–1783), were entrusted to him.

In 1759, Berthoud published a successful popular treatise, &quot;L&#x27;Art de conduire et de régler les pendules et les montres. À l&#x27;usage de ceux qui n&#x27;ont aucune connaissance d&#x27;horlogerie&quot;1&quot;.&quot;6 In 1763, his lengthy treatise &quot;L&#x27;Essai sur l&#x27;horlogerie; dans lequel on traite de cet Art relativement à l&#x27;usage civil, à l&#x27;Astronomie et à la Navigation&quot; was also well received. This popular work was very successful, translated into several languages, and republished several times in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

1763 marked a turning point in Berthoud&#x27;s career, which from then on focused on the progress of maritime navigation. Once again, the French Academy of Sciences was to be both a witness and a support: in that year, the watchmaker had two envelopes opened that had been filed in 1760 and 1761. These describe the Sea Clock number 17. On 29 August of the same year, Ferdinand Berthoud filed another envelope entitled &quot;Construction d&#x27;une montre marine...&quot;

His work was characterised by regular projects accompanied by detailed requests. For instance, he proposed the construction of two sea watches on 7 May 1766. These were Numbers 6 and 8, now preserved at the French Museum of Arts and Trades. Following successful experiments with them, Ferdinand Berthoud received the title of &quot;Horologist-Mechanic by appointment to the King and the Navy for the inspection of the construction of sea clocks&quot; on 1 August 1770.

In 1773, Ferdinand Berthoud published his &quot;Traité des horloges marines contenant la théorie, la construction, la main-d&#x27;œuvre de ces machines et la manière de les éprouver, pour parvenir par leur moyen, à la rectification des cartes marines et à la détermination des longitudes en mer&quot;. This treatise was a first, detailing all the parts required for building a sea clock. It helped seal the reputation of Berthoud&#x27;s work, in particular with respect to his competitors in longitude at sea research, such as Harrison and Pierre Le Roy (1717–1785).

Two years later, in 1775, Ferdinand Berthoud published another work, &quot;Les longitudes par la mesure du temps ou méthode pour déterminer les longitudes en mer avec le secours des horloges marines, suivie du recueil des tables nécessaires au pilot pour réduire les observations relatives à la longitude et à la latitude&quot;. A second edition of this book was published in 1785.

In 1787, Berthoud published &quot;De la Mesure du Temps ou supplément au traité des horloges marines et à l&#x27;Essai sur l&#x27;horlogerie, contenant les principes d&#x27;exécution, de construction et d&#x27;épreuves des petites horloges à longitudes et l&#x27;application des mêmes principes de construction aux montres de poche, ainsi que plusieurs construction d&#x27;horloges astronomiques.&quot; This was translated into German in 1798.

In 1792, Ferdinand Berthoud published his &quot;Traité des montres à Longitudes&quot; &quot;contenant la construction, la description &amp; tous les détails de main-d&#x27;œuvre de ces Machines; leurs dimensions, la manière de les éprouver, etc.&quot;, in which he recommended compensation using the balance wheel, with final adjustment using the spiral (page 172), to achieve better isochronism.

Four years later, in 1796, Berthoud published the &quot;Suite du Traité des montres à longitudes, contenant : 1° la construction des montres verticales portatives, 2° la description et les épreuves des petites horloges horizontales plus simples et plus portatives pour servir dans les plus longues traversées.&quot;

In 1802, Ferdinand Berthoud published one of his most important works: &quot;Histoire de la mesure du temps par les horloges&quot;, in which he demonstrates his outstanding knowledge of the art of horological mechanics.

In 1807, the year of his death, Berthoud published his final work, entitled &quot;Supplément au Traité des montres à Longitudes avec appendice contenant la notice ou indication des principales recherches ou des travaux faits par Ferdinand Berthoud sur divers parties des machines qui mesurent le temps depuis 1752 à 1807&quot;. Fresh editions were published in 1816 and 1838.

As a determined experimenter, a skilled and daring craftsman, and an inventor keen to pass on his knowledge, Ferdinand Berthoud not only made a contribution to the advance of watchmaking but also promoted the use of precision clocks in the sciences of his day, thus contributing to progress in these various disciplines. He is the only watchmaker to have published the findings of all his research in a detailed, methodical manner. Gifted with a genuine spirit of scientific engineering and an extraordinary capacity for work, Ferdinand Berthoud performed more experiments than any other watchmaker of his day.

Ferdinand Berthoud left behind him an extraordinary output in a variety of fields: sea chronometers, watches and decorative clocks, specialist tools, and scientific measurement instruments, as well as publishing scores of written works and specialist dissertations, totalling over 4,000 pages and 120 copperplates.

The titles, privileges, and testimonials of recognition throughout his career, extending from the reign of Louis XV through to the First Empire, as well as the tributes and studies that highlight his critical renown through to the present day, reflect the importance of his place in the long quest for accuracy.

<doc id="1177329" wikidata="Q486901" url="?curid=1177329" title="Secondary market">
<text>The secondary market, also called the aftermarket and follow on public offering, is the financial market in which previously issued financial instruments such as stock, bonds, options, and futures are bought and sold. The initial sale of the security by the issuer to a purchaser, who pays proceeds to the issuer, is the primary market. All sales after the initial sale of the security are sales in the secondary market. Whereas the term primary market refers to the market for new issues of securities, and &quot;[a] market is primary if the proceeds of sales go to the issuer of the securities sold,&quot; the secondary market in contrast is the market created by the later trading of such securities.

With primary issuances of securities or financial instruments (the primary market), often an underwriter purchases these securities directly from issuers, such as corporations issuing shares in an initial public offering (IPO) or private placement. Then the underwriter re-sells the securities to other buyers, in what is referred to as a secondary market or aftermarket (or a buyer in contrast may buy directly from the federal government, in the case of a government issuing treasuries).

==Forms of secondary market==

The secondary market can be for a variety of assets, that can vary from stocks to loans, from fragmented to centralized, and from illiquid to very liquid. 

The major stock exchanges are the most visible example of liquid secondary markets—in this case, for stocks of publicly traded companies. Exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq Stock Market provide centralized, liquid secondary markets for investors who wish to buy or sell stocks that trade on those exchanges. Most bonds and structured products trade &quot;over the counter&quot;, or by phoning the bond desk of one’s broker-dealer. Loans sometimes trade online, using a loan exchange.

Another usage of &quot;secondary market&quot; is to refer to loans which are sold by a mortgage bank to investors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The term &quot;secondary market&quot; is also used to refer to the market for any used goods or assets, or an alternative use for an existing product or asset where the customer base is the second market (for example, corn has been traditionally used primarily for food production and feedstock, but a &quot;second&quot; or &quot;third&quot; market has developed for use in ethanol production).

==Function==

In the secondary market, securities are sold by and transferred from one buyer to another. It is therefore important that the secondary market be highly liquid. Originally, the only way to create this liquidity was for investors and speculators to meet at a fixed place regularly; this is how stock exchanges originated (see History of the Stock Exchange). As a general rule, the greater the number of investors that participate in a given marketplace, and the greater the centralization of that marketplace, the more liquid the market.

Accurate share price allocates scarce capital more efficiently when new projects are financed through a new primary market offering, but accuracy may also matter in the secondary market because: 1) price accuracy can reduce the agency costs of management, and make hostile takeover a less risky proposition and thus move capital into the hands of better managers; and 2) accurate share price aids the efficient allocation of debt finance whether debt offerings or institutional borrowing.

==Related usage==

The term may refer to markets in things of value other than securities. For example, the ability to buy and sell intellectual property such as patents, or rights to musical compositions, is considered a secondary market because it allows the owner to freely resell property entitlements issued by the government. Similarly, secondary markets can be said to exist in some real estate contexts as well (&quot;e.g.&quot;, ownership shares of time-share vacation homes are bought and sold outside of the official exchange set up by the timeshare issuers). These have very similar functions as secondary stock and bond markets in allowing for speculation, providing liquidity, and financing through securitization. This facilitates liquidity and marketability of the long-term instrument. It also provides instant valuation of securities caused by changes in the environment.

==Private secondary markets==
Private-equity secondary market refers to the buying and selling of pre-existing investor commitments to private-equity funds. Sellers of private-equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund, but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds.

Due to the increased compliance and reporting obligations on U.S. public company boards of directors and management and public accounting firms enacted in the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, private secondary markets began to emerge, such as SecondMarket and SecondaryLink. These markets are generally only available to institutional or accredited investors, and allow trading of unregistered and private company securities.

<doc id="1177331" wikidata="Q1799406" url="?curid=1177331" title="Stylophone">
<text>The Stylophone is a miniature analog electronic keyboard musical instrument played with a stylus. Invented in 1967 by Brian Jarvis, it entered production in 1968, manufactured by Dubreq.

Some three million Stylophones were sold, mostly as children&#x27;s toys, but they were occasionally used by professional musicians such as John Lennon, Kraftwerk and David Bowie.

It was relaunched in 2007 by toy company Re:creation in partnership with a rebuilt Dubreq and several new models were released.

==Original models==
The Stylophone consists of a metal keyboard made of printed circuit board and is played by touching it with a stylus. Each note on the keyboard is connected to a voltage-controlled oscillator via a different-value resistor, and touching the stylus to the keyboard thus closes a circuit. The only other controls are a power switch and a vibrato control on the front panel beside the keyboard, and a tuning potentiometer on the rear.

The Stylophone was available in standard, bass and treble variants, but the standard version was the most common. There was also a larger version called the 350S with more notes on the keyboard, various voices, a wah-wah effect that was controlled by moving the hand over a photosensor and two styluses.

In the mid-1970s, a new model appeared that featured simulated wood on the speaker panel and a volume control. However, production of the Stylophone ceased in 1975.

Entertainer Rolf Harris served for several years as the Stylophone&#x27;s advertising spokesman in the United Kingdom and appeared on many &quot;play-along&quot; records sold by the manufacturer.

==2007 revival==

In October 2007, 28 years after the Stylophone had ceased production, toy company Re:creation, in conjunction with Dubreq Ltd. (reformed in 2003 by Ben Jarvis, the son of the original inventor), relaunched the Stylophone. The 2007 revival model, manufactured in China and was officially called the S1, is a digital copy that closely resembles the 1960s original but features a volume control, audio throughput and two new sounds. However, the Bass, Treble, and 350S models from the 1970s were not relaunched with it.

===Stylophone S2===
In December 2012, Dubreq released the Series 2 Stylophone, a limited edition, British-made, true analogue synthesizer.

===Stylophone Beatbox===
This model strays from the normal box-shaped Stylophone. It is a mainly round case that has a circular keypad containing 13 contact areas. It offers three sound banks and a tempo control. It also features a basic record/loop function.

===Stylophone Gen X-1===
In January 2017, Dubreq released details of the Stylophone Gen X-1 portable analogue synthesizer. It was designed and manufactured by Dubreq. The Gen X-1 has additional controls for LFO, analog delay, low-pass filter, and envelope settings. It also includes sub-octave switches, and an input so it can be used as an effects unit

===Stylophone GEN R-8===
In 2019, Dubreq announced the Gen R-8, a limited edition, full-analogue, metal-cased Stylophone. This version has features seen on more expensive analogue synthesizers and is considerably larger than the standard model. An initial batch of 500 has been released.

===Stylophone Analog Sound S1===
In 2020, Dubreq released a replacement for the 2007 S1. The new model is visually similar to its predecessor but has less rounded corners and no auxiliary input. Internally, the digital sampled sounds have been replaced by an analogue oscillator based on a 555 timer IC, and the tone selector offers three octave ranges. The sound is much more similar to that of the 1970s versions.

===Bowie Limited Edition===
In 2021, Dubreq launched a limited edition version of the Analog S1 as a tribute to the late David Bowie. This model has an all-white finish, has an official Bowie logo moulded into the chromed grille and includes a colour-printed booklet including photos, interviews and tablature for a selection of Bowie&#x27;s songs.

=== Stylophone Beat ===
In October of 2023, Dubreq released the successor to the Stylophone Beatbox, the Stylophone Beat. Like the stylophone beatbox, it has a record and play button and the circle metal pad. But unlike the stylophone beatbox, it is now more of a box shape, has 4 sound banks (rok, techno, hiphop, and beatbox), stay in time with the click track &amp; tempo lock features and can record multiple layers of beats and can mute other sounds coming from it.

=== Stylophone Theremin ===

On January 8, 2024, Dubreq released a Stylophone themed (pitch-only) theremin. This theremin uses a slider for the different notes, unlike the other Stylophone models, which use a stylus. it has a 3-position switch which can be used to get the sound from the slider, the antenna, or a mix of both.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="1177340" wikidata="Q6703353" url="?curid=1177340" title="Lumley Castle">
<text>Lumley Castle is a 14th-century quadrangular castle at Chester-le-Street in the North of England, near the city of Durham, and a property of the Earl of Scarbrough. It is a Grade I listed building. It is currently a hotel.

==History==
It is named after its original creator, Sir Ralph Lumley, who converted his family manor house into a castle in 1389 after returning from wars in Scotland. However, after being implicated in a plot to overthrow Henry IV, he was imprisoned and ultimately executed, forfeiting his lands to the Earl of Somerset. In 1421 the ownership of the castle reverted to Sir Ralph Lumley&#x27;s grandson, Thomas.

During the time of John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley, he altered the windows of the castle to let more light in, installed a new fireplace in the great hall along with a lavabo of black and white marble, adorned by a pelican, which is the crest of the Lumley coat of the arms. On the accession of James VI and I as King of England in 1603, he journeyed from Edinburgh to London to take his new throne. On 13 April, en route from Newcastle upon Tyne to Durham, he stopped briefly at the castle as a guest of Lord Lumley. The King James Suite hotel room commemorates this connection with the king. However, the suite was previously the chapel; the king did not stay at Lumley overnight, instead travelling later that day and staying at Durham Castle.

Although there are no documents to prove it, the Georgian alterations to the castle are attributed to Sir John Vanbrugh, particularly the library, which is now the Black Knight Restaurant.

By the nineteenth century, the castle had become the residence of the Bishop of Durham, after Bishop Van Mildert gave his residence of Durham Castle to the newly founded University of Durham. The castle thus became a hall of residence for University College, Durham. Castlemen, as the students of University College are known, spent their first year at Lumley Castle and subsequent years in the Castle at Durham. Lumley Castle was sold in the 1960s by University College to fund the building of the &#x27;Moatside&#x27; residential halls in central Durham, in order to keep all students on the same site. The role of Lumley Castle in University College&#x27;s history is still commemorated by students in the biannual &#x27;Lumley Run&#x27;.

==Today==
In 1976, management of the castle was handed over to No Ordinary Hotels, which had the castle turned into the 73-bedroomed hotel it is today, but it is still in the possession of the present Lord Scarbrough. It is also a picturesque backdrop for Durham County Cricket Club&#x27;s Riverside Ground, which was first used in 1995, and often houses visiting cricket teams. In 2019 the castle teamed up with Escape Rooms Durham to offer a live Escape Game housed inside the castle&#x27;s old beer cellar. It tells the story of Lily of Lumley and opened on St Valentine&#x27;s Day 2019.

==Hauntings==
The castle is believed to be one of the most haunted places in County Durham, which includes a story about a woman named Lily Lumley who married Ralph Lumley. In reality, the said Ralph Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley (c. 1360 – January 1400) was married to Eleanor Neville. But in a tale called &quot;The Lily of Lumley&quot; he has a previous wife. She was supposedly thrown down a well in the castle grounds by two priests for rejecting the Catholic faith, who then told Baron Lumley she had left him to become a nun. Her ghost is said to float up from the well and haunt the castle. A contemporary romance of medieval times, the tale was based on a legend of a lady of Lumley who was murdered. This woman is not identified in family pedigrees. In 2000 and 2005, visiting cricketers staying at the castle claimed to have witnessed paranormal activity including Indian Captain Sourav Ganguly. Several members of the 2005 Australian tour party recounted the strong effect its reputation and setting had had on them.

<doc id="1177361" wikidata="Q4852977" url="?curid=1177361" title="Baltimore accent">
<text>A Baltimore accent, also known as Baltimorese and sometimes humorously spelled Bawlmerese or Ballimorese, is an accent or sub-variety of Delaware Valley English (a dialect whose largest hub is Philadelphia) that originates among blue-collar residents of Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It extends into the Baltimore metropolitan area and northeastern Maryland.

At the same time, there is considerable linguistic diversity within Baltimore, which complicates the notion of a singular &quot;Baltimore accent&quot;. According to linguists, the accent of white blue-collar Baltimoreans is different from the African-American Vernacular English accent of black Baltimoreans. White working-class families who migrated out of Baltimore to the northwestern suburbs brought local pronunciations with them.

==Pronunciation==

The Baltimore accent that originated among white blue-collar residents closely resembles blue-collar Philadelphia-area English pronunciation in many ways. These two cities are the only major ports on the Eastern Seaboard never to have developed non-rhotic speech among European American speakers; they were greatly influenced in their early development by Hiberno-English, Scottish English, and West Country English. Due to the significant similarity between the speeches of Baltimore, Philadelphia, Delaware and southern New Jersey, sociolinguists refer to them collectively as the Mid-Atlantic regional dialect. In Baltimore accents, sounds around are often &quot;smoothed&quot; or elided. For example, a word like &quot;bureau&quot; is commonly pronounced (e.g., Federal &quot;Beer-o&quot; of Investigation) and &quot;mirror&quot; is commonly pronounced (&quot;mere&quot;); the related mare–mayor merger also exists.

===Vowels===
*Several vowels undergo fronting. fronts to or . fronts to . Similarly, shifts to or even . When word-final and spelled as &quot;-ow&quot;, it is pronounced like , resulting in colloquial or humorous spellings like &quot;pilla&quot; for &quot;pillow&quot; and &quot;winda&quot; for &quot;window&quot;.
*No cot–caught merger: The words &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; do not rhyme, with the latter vowel maintaining a raised position. Likewise, the word &quot;on&quot; rhymes with &quot;dawn&quot; and not &quot;don&quot;.
*As in Philadelphia, the word &quot;water&quot; is often pronounced as &quot;wooder&quot; or, more uniquely, &quot;warter&quot; .
*As in most Mid-Atlantic cities, short &quot;a&quot; is pronounced with a phonemic split: for example, the word &quot;sad&quot; does not rhyme with the word &quot;mad&quot; . Pronunciation is dependent upon a complex system of rules that differ from city to city. Baltimore follows the Philadelphia pattern. For more details on the Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore systems see &quot;:/æ/ raising&quot;.

*The vowel in words like &quot;start&quot; is often raised and backed, resulting in a vowel close to . Likewise, as in &quot;bore&quot; can shift as high as as in &quot;boor&quot;. This pattern has also been noted to occur in Philadelphia and New York.
*Canadian raising occurs for before voiceless consonants, as in Philadelphia; for instance, the word &quot;like&quot; [ɫʌɪk] begins with a higher nucleus than &quot;live&quot; [ɫaɪv].
*On the other hand, may undergo smoothing before liquids, becoming before and ; e.g., &quot;fire&quot; is pronounced as , in which a popular Baltimore Christmas joke: &quot;Why were the Three Wise Men covered with soot?&quot; &quot;Because they came from afar.&quot;
* is often eliminated entirely from a word when before a consonant; e.g. Annapolis = Naplis, cigarette = cigrette, company = compny, Italy = Itly.

===Consonants===
*&quot;Th&quot;–stopping occurs, where the dental fricatives may be realized as stops ( respectively); for instance, &quot;this&quot; may sound more like &quot;diss&quot;.
*&quot;L&quot;–vocalization is common at the end of a word. The sound is often replaced by the semivowel or glide and/or or . Pronunciation of words like &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;college&quot; become and respectively.
*Epenthetic often occurs; notably, &quot;wash&quot; is pronounced as , popularly written as &quot;warsh&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot; is pronounced as &quot;Warshington&quot;.
*As is common in many US dialects, is frequently elided after , thus &quot;hunter&quot; is pronounced .

==Lexicon==

The following is a list of words and phrases used in the Baltimore area that are used much less or differently in other American English dialects.
*&quot;down the ocean&quot; – (eye-dialect spellings include &quot;dayown the ocean&quot; or &quot;downy ocean&quot;) &quot;down to/on/at the ocean&quot;, often Ocean City, Maryland.
*&quot;hon&quot; – a popular term of endearment, short for &quot;honey&quot;, often used at the end of a sentence. This word has been a popular marker of Baltimore culture, as represented in the annual Honfest summer festival and in landmarks such as the Hontown store and the Café Hon restaurant.
*&quot;natty boh&quot; – local slang for the beer originally brewed in Baltimore, National Bohemian.
*&quot;pavement&quot; (commonly pronounced &quot;payment&quot;) – means &quot;sidewalk.&quot; 
*&quot;went up&quot; (shortened from &quot;went up to heaven&quot;) – commonly used when an appliance dies; e.g., our refrigerator went up
*&quot;yo&quot; – as a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun

African-American Baltimore English includes the words &quot;ard&quot; for &quot;alright&quot;, &quot;lor&quot; for &quot;little&quot;, &quot;rey&quot; for &quot;ready&quot; (associated with Baltimore users of Black Twitter), and &quot;woe&quot; for a close friend.

== African-American variations ==
According to linguists, the &quot;hon&quot; dialect that is popularized in the media and that derives historically from the speech of white blue-collar residents of South and Southeast Baltimore is not the only accent spoken in the region. There is also a particular Baltimore accent found among Black Baltimoreans: a sub-type of African-American Vernacular English.

For example, among Black speakers, Baltimore is pronounced more like &quot;Baldamore&quot; , as compared to &quot;Bawlmer&quot; . Other notable phonological characteristics include vowel centralization before (such that words such as &quot;carry&quot; and &quot;parents&quot; are often pronounced as &quot;curry&quot; or &quot;purrents&quot;, and &quot;Aaron earned an iron urn&quot; might sound like &quot;Urrun urned an urn urn&quot;) and the mid-centralization of , particularly in the word &quot;dog,&quot; often pronounced like &quot;dug,&quot; and &quot;frog&quot; as &quot;frug.&quot;
The African-American Baltimore accent, or a variation thereof, is also shared by many African Americans throughout Maryland and the Washington metropolitan area.

==Notable examples of native speakers==
===Lifelong speakers===
*Ben Cardin – Maryland U.S. Senator (2007–present)
*Mary Pat Clarke – Baltimore City Councilwoman (1975–2020)
*Divine – actor
*Charley Eckman – NBA coach and referee, sportscaster
*Mel Kiper Jr. – Football analyst for ESPN
*Barbara Mikulski – Maryland U.S. Senator (1987– 2017)
*Felicia Pearson – actress on &quot;The Wire&quot;
*Babe Ruth – Baseball Hall of Famer
*John Waters – filmmaker
*Nancy Pelosi – former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives
*Stavros Halkias – Stand-up Comedian

==In popular culture==

===Films===
The films of John Waters, many of which have been filmed in and around Baltimore, often attempt to capture the Baltimore accent, particularly the early films. For example, John Waters uses his own Baltimore accent in the commentary during his film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;. John Travolta&#x27;s character in the 2007 version of John Waters&#x27;s &quot;Hairspray&quot; spoke with an exaggerated Baltimore accent. Likewise, several of the films of Barry Levinson are set in and around Baltimore during the 1940s-1960s, and employ the Baltimore accent. Michael Tucker, who &quot;was&quot; born and raised in Baltimore, speaks with a West Baltimore accent.

===Television===
Television drama series &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot; are both set in Baltimore and in some cases include actors who are native white and black Baltimoreans. In the early &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot; episode &quot;Three Men and Adena&quot;, a suspect, Risley Tucker, describes how he can tell whereabouts in or around the city a person comes from simply by whether they pronounce the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Balti-maw&quot;, &quot;Balti-moh&quot;, or &quot;Bawl-mer&quot;.

In Season 4, Episode 7 of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, Baltimore actor Michael Tucker portrays the father of Ullman&#x27;s character JoJo. The skit is set in a Baltimore row house. Tucker advises Ullman to &quot;take a Liverpool accent and Americanize it.&quot; The episode called &quot;The Stoops&quot; begins with Tracey washing her marble stoops, which are the most common small porches attached to most Baltimore town homes (called row houses in Baltimore).

In the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode, &quot;I Do Do&quot;, Elizabeth Banks parodies the accent by portraying Avery Jessup, the spokesperson for the fictional Overshoppe.com in a flashback scene.

Kathy Bates&#x27; character on the &quot;Freak Show&quot; season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; was inspired by a Baltimore accent.

Whether it was on his ESPN Radio show or &quot;SportsCenter at Night&quot;, Scott Van Pelt always ended his segments with Tim Kurkjian by mentioning names in a Baltimore accent featuring at least one fronted &#x27;o&#x27;.

===Music===
Singer-songwriter Mary Prankster uses several examples of Baltimore slang in her song, &quot;Blue Skies Over Dundalk,&quot; from the album of the same name, including, &quot;There&#x27;ll be O&#x27;s fans going downy ocean, hon.&quot;

===Podcasts===
Jason La Canfora, host of the &quot;B-More Opinionated&quot; podcast with Jerry Coleman and resident of Dundalk, regularly discussed events of the National Football League for &quot;The Tony Kornheiser Show&quot; podcast and will end the segment plugging his own podcast in a heavy Baltimore accent. The accent is so distinct that his dog, Copper, will react to it, barking constantly because he knows it is time for a walk.

Comedian Stavros Halkias (a native of Greektown) was also known for performing an exaggerated version of a Baltimore accent on the podcast &quot;Cum Town&quot;, when impersonating a typical citizen of Dundalk.

<text>Crust was a musical group from Austin, Texas that was active during the late-1980s and 1990s and was featured on Trance Syndicate Records, a record label run by King Coffey from the Butthole Surfers. The group&#x27;s members were John Hawkins (vocals and misc.), Jerry Page (bass and misc.), and Richard Smith (percussion and misc.).

== History ==
John Hawkins, Jerry Page, and Richard Smith formed the group in 1987. Shortly after its formation, the trio (as &quot;Mud Honey&quot;) organized and released a compilation cassette, &quot;The Polyp Explodes&quot;. Along with Crust, the cassette featured the Austin bands Miracle Room, Ed Hall, ST37, Seemen, and Thanatopsis Throne. The band&#x27;s early instrumentation included tape loops, feedback devices, spring reverberators, and drum machines, but later incorporated traditional rock instruments such as drum kit, electric guitar, bass and keyboard.

The band embarked on a concert tour of the West Coast in December 1989. Crust achieved some notoriety for their stage antics, which frequently included live earthworms, fresh beef tongues, nudity, and fire.

On Good Friday, 1990, Trance Syndicate released Crust&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Sacred Heart of Crust&quot;; it was the first release from the record label. The trio toured the East Coast of the United States and Canada; songs such as &quot;Head Lice&quot; emerged from the group&#x27;s travel experiences. Trance Syndicate released the band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Crust&quot; in 1991, followed by a second album, &quot;Crusty Love&quot; in 1994. The band continued to tour, but scaled back its live performances following a series of mishaps (including one in which John Hawkins was stabbed), finally disbanding after an appearance at the 1997 SXSW festival. The band performed a reunion show to a sold-out crowd at Room 710 on May 22, 2004 in Austin.

Bass guitarist Jerry Page died in November 2024.

<doc id="1177383" wikidata="Q637775" url="?curid=1177383" title="Daphné-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Daphné&quot;-class submarine was a class of the diesel-electric powered submarines designed and constructed for the French Navy in 1964. Marketed by the French government for the export market, the &quot;Daphné&quot; design went on to serve in South Africa while there were subclasses based on the &quot;Daphné&quot; design that were commissioned in the navies of Pakistan, Portugal, and Spain. The submarines were in operation between 1964 and the late 1990s, their service lives being extended to fill the capability gap until the newer French nuclear submarines became available. Two French submarines were lost and a third was sunk, but was salvaged.

==Background and design==

These submarines were developed from the preceding by the French Navy. Larger than the &quot;Aréthuse&quot; class, they were a second class counterpart to the ocean-going &quot;Narval&quot; class. Their design emphasized maneuverability, low noise production and ease of maintenance. As a result, the submarines were extremely quiet when submerged. Their maintenance system was based on modular replacement which led to low crew numbers, but also led to no reloads for their torpedo complement.

Submarines of the &quot;Daphné&quot; class in French service measured long overall with a beam of and a draught of . They had a standard displacement of , and displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines had a double hull and had a complement of 6 officers and 39 sailors.

Each vessel of the class was fitted with two SEMT-Pielstick diesel engines, with two 450-kilowatt diesel generator sets, and two electric motors turning two shafts creating sustained with the ability to create for short periods. The first seven boats were given the SEMT-Pielstick 12 PA1 diesel engine type, while the final two hulls were given the SEMT-Pielstick 12 PA4-135 type. The submarines had a diving depth of and could remain at sea for 30 days. &quot;Daphné&quot;-class submarines had a maximum speed of surfaced and submerged with a range of at while snorkelling.

The submarines were equipped with twelve torpedo tubes, eight located in the bow and four located in the stern. The submarines was armed with twelve torpedoes and no reloads. Each submarine sported one DRUA 33 radar and DUUA 1 sonar. Beginning in 1971, the boats were modernized and given the DUUA 2B search and attack sonar located in a dome situated atop the bow. They also received the updated DLT D3 torpedo fire control system. The submarines also mounted DSUV 2 passive sonar and DUUX 2 acoustic telemeter.

==Construction and career==

Constructed at three shipyards in France, the first entered service in 1964 and the last in 1970. Two French submarines were lost; &quot;Minerve&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Eurydice&quot; in 1970. All of the remaining submarines underwent modernization beginning in 1971. &quot;Sirène&quot; sank in 1972 at Lorient, but was salvaged. The boats were planned for disposal in the 1980s, however, the slow delivery of their nuclear submarine replacements led to their careers being extended.

==Ships in class==
==Export==
Following the end of World War II, the export market for warships had changed. Gone were the old purveyors of export warships like Italy and the US only sold used designs. This left the United Kingdom and France as the only countries with the extra shipbuilding capability to build ships for export. In the 1960s, the United Kingdom offered the and the French offered the &quot;Daphné&quot; class. The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were more expensive and more difficult to operate. Smaller navies opted for the &quot;Daphné&quot;s or in the case of Spain, were rejected by the United Kingdom.

===Pakistan Navy===

The Pakistan Navy &quot;Daphné&quot;-class submarines, sometimes dubbed the &quot;Hangor&quot; class, were three submarines built in France for Pakistan and one acquired from Portugal in 1975. The first three hulls ordered were the first ever submarines constructed for Pakistan. The &quot;Hangor&quot; class used the 12 PA4-135 type diesel engines and had a complement of 5 officers and 45 sailors. Their interior differed from the French model in order to meet Pakistan&#x27;s requirements. The fourth hull was acquired from Portugal in 1975. PNS &quot;Hangor&quot; sank the Indian frigate during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war. In the late 1980s, the vessels had the capability of launching submarine-launched anti-ship missiles added, making them able to fire Harpoon missiles. Pakistan has now retired the submarines and is replacing them.

===Portuguese Navy===
The four &quot;Albacora&quot;-class submarines of the Portuguese Navy were ordered in 1964 and built in France using the &quot;Daphné&quot; design with some modifications to meet Portuguese requirements. The submarines were of prefabricated design with component sections being constructed between 1 October 1964 and 6 September 1965. The four vessels were equipped with the SEMT-Pielstick 12 PA1 diesel engines. The submarines were fitted for operating in tropical waters. In 1975 Portugal sold &quot;Cachalote&quot; to Pakistan.

===South African Navy===

After South Africa became a republic in 1961, the country was forced to leave the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom refused to sell weapons to the country. South Africa turned to France and in conjunction with the construction of a submarine base at Simon&#x27;s Town, acquired three &quot;Daphné&quot; hulls in 1967. These were the first submarines ever constructed for South Africa. Upon completion of the first ship, the three vessels were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Maria van Riebeeck&quot; class. They had a complement of 47, including 6 officers. The submarines were modernized locally, receiving updated sonar and displays in the 1980s, with &quot;Emily Hobhouse&quot; finishing the refit in 1988, &quot;Johanna van der Merwe&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Maria van Riebeeck&quot; in 1992. In 1980, South Africa attempted to acquire two of Portugal&#x27;s hulls.

===Spanish Navy===

As part of Spain&#x27;s attempt to build up their shipbuilding industry in the post-World War II era, they sought to learn techniques from various nations by acquiring ships from them, such as American destroyers and submarines. Initially, the Spanish sough to acquire British &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines but failed to complete a deal after receiving a negative reaction from the British. The Spanish turned to the French and in an agreement signed on 16 July 1966, acquired the right to build &quot;Daphné&quot;-class submarines under license in Spain with design aid from France. Designated the &quot;Delfín&quot; class or the S-60 class by Spain, the vessels were of a modified design, measuring long with a draught of and displacing surfaced and submerged. The first two hulls were ordered in December 1966, followed by two more in March 1970. A fifth hull was planned, but never ordered. All four submarines were by built by Bazan at their Cartagena dockyard. The submarines were modernized at Cartagena between 1983 and 1988 where the navy replaced their DUUA 1 sonar forward with the DUUA 2A model and updated the torpedo fire control. The DUUA 2 was mounted forward in a dome on the bow like on the French submarines while the submarines kept the DUUA-1D sonar at the rear.

<text>John Mayow FRS (1641–1679) was a chemist, physician, and physiologist who is remembered today for conducting early research into respiration and the nature of air. Mayow worked in a field that is sometimes called pneumatic chemistry.

== Life ==

There has been controversy over both the location and year of Mayow&#x27;s birth, with both Cornwall and London claimed, along with birth years from 1641 to 1645. Proctor&#x27;s extensive research led him to conclude that Mayow was born in 1641 near Morval in Cornwall and that he was admitted to Wadham College, Oxford at age 17 in 1658. A year later Mayow became a scholar at Oxford, and in 1660 he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls. He graduated in law (bachelor, 1665, doctor, 1670), but made medicine his profession, and became noted for his practice therein, especially in the summer time, in the city of Bath. In 1678, on the proposal of Robert Hooke, Mayow was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society. The following year, after a marriage which was not altogether to Mayow&#x27;s content, he died in London and was buried in the Church of St Paul, Covent Garden.

== Scientific work ==
Mayow also discovered that there were two constituents of air. Inactive and active. Mayow published at Oxford in 1668 two tracts, on respiration and rickets, and in 1674 these were reprinted, the former in an enlarged and corrected form, with three others &quot;De sal-nitro et spiritu nitro-aereo&quot;, &quot;De respiratione foetus in utero et ovo&quot;, and &quot;De motu musculari et spiritibus animalibus&quot; as &quot;Tractatus quinque medico-physici&quot;. The contents of this work, which was several times republished and translated into Dutch, German and French, show him to have been an investigator much in advance of his time.

Accepting as proved by Boyle&#x27;s experiments that air is necessary for combustion, Mayow showed that fire is supported not by the air as a whole but by a more active and subtle part of it. This part he called &quot;spiritus igneo-aereus,&quot; or sometimes &quot;nitro-aereus&quot;, for he identified it with one of the constituents of the acid portion of nitre (now called potassium nitrate, KNO3) which he regarded as formed by the union of fixed alkali with a spiritus acidus. In combustion the particulae nitro-aereae – either pre-existent in the thing consumed or supplied by the air – combined with the material burnt; as Mayow inferred from his observation that antimony, strongly heated with a burning glass, undergoes an increase of weight which can be attributed to nothing else but these particles.

Mayow argued that the same particles are consumed in respiration, because he found that when a small animal and a lighted candle were placed in a closed vessel full of air the candle first went out and soon afterwards the animal died. However, if there was no candle present the animal lived twice as long. He concluded that this constituent of the air is absolutely necessary for life, and supposed that the lungs separate it from the atmosphere and pass it into the blood. It is also necessary, Mayow inferred, for all muscular movements, and he thought there was reason to believe that the sudden contraction of muscle is produced by its combination with other combustible (salino-sulphureous) particles in the body; hence the heart, being a muscle, ceases to beat when respiration is stopped. Animal heat also is due to the union of nitro-aerial particles, breathed in from the air, with the combustible particles in the blood, and is further formed by the combination of these two sets of particles in muscle during violent exertion.

In effect, therefore, Mayow – who also gives a remarkably correct anatomical description of the mechanism of respiration – preceded Priestley and Lavoisier by a century in recognising the existence of oxygen, under the guise of his &quot;spiritus nitro-aereus,&quot; as a separate entity distinct from the general mass of the air. Mayow perceived the part &quot;spiritus nitro-aereus&quot; plays in combustion and in increasing the weight of the calces (oxides) of metals as compared with metals themselves. Rejecting the common notions of his time that the use of breathing is to cool the heart, or assist the passage of the blood from the right to the left side of the heart, or merely to agitate it, Mayow saw in inspiration a mechanism for introducing oxygen into the body, where it is consumed for the production of heat and muscular activity. He even vaguely conceived of expiration as an excretory process. Using bell-jars over water Mayow showed that the active substance that we today call oxygen constitutes about a fifth part of the air.

Parts of Mayow&#x27;s work seem to agree with modern ideas regarding air and combustion. Mayow noted, as had others before him, that some materials gain weight on strong heating. Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) and others later interpreted this gain in terms of a reaction with a gaseous material (oxygen) in the air. See Holmyard and others for critiques of Mayow&#x27;s work and comparisons to modern chemical thought.

<doc id="1177394" wikidata="Q1240704" url="?curid=1177394" title="Islam in Brazil">
<text>[[Brazil]] is a predominantly Christian country with Islam being a minority religion, first brought by African slaves and then by Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. Due to the secular nature of Brazil&#x27;s constitution, Muslims are free to proselytize and build places of worship in the country. However, Islam is not independently included in charts and graphics representing religions in Brazil due to its very small size, being grouped in &quot;other religions&quot;, which generally represent about 1% of the country&#x27;s population. The number of Muslims in Brazil, according to the 2010 census, was 35,207 out of a population of approximately 191 million people. This corresponds to 0.018% of the Brazilian population.

==History==
===African immigration===
The history of Muslims in Brazil begins with the importation of African slave labor to the country. Brazil obtained 37% of all African slaves traded. Over 3 million slaves were sent to Brazil. Starting around 1550, the Portuguese began to trade African slaves to work the sugar plantations once the native Tupi people deteriorated. Scholars claim that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas.

During the days of the Barbary Wars, some native Brazilians came into interaction with Muslim lands. It was noted by Dr. Antonio Sosa, a Portuguese cleric held captive in North Africa in the 1570s, that the port of Algiers maintained one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world including Amerindians from Iberian colonies in the New World. Barbary pirates were known to attack the shipping of slaves and merchandise while taking prisoners coming from the Americas. In 1673, 140 prisoners were taken from a Rio de Janeiro fleet, while a 1674 capture of a Brazilian ship contributed in the decision to increase naval protection.

===Malê Revolt===

The Muslim uprising of 1835 in Bahia illustrates the condition and legacy of resistance among the community of &quot;Malês&quot;, as African Muslims were known in 19th-century Bahia. The majority of the participants were Nago, the local designation for ethnic Yoruba. Pacifico Licutan was one of the leaders of the revolt. Many of the &quot;Malês&quot; had been soldiers and captives in the wars between Oyo, Ilorin and other Yoruba city-states in the early part of the 19th century. Other participants included Hausa and Nupe clerics, along with Jeje or Dahomean soldiers who had converted to Islam or fought in alliance with Muslims.&quot;

Beginning on the night of January 24, 1835, and continuing the following morning, a group of African born slaves occupied the streets of Salvador and for more than three hours they confronted soldiers and armed civilians.

Even though it was short lived, the revolt was the largest slave revolt in Brazil and the largest urban slave revolt in the Americas. About 300 Africans took part and the estimated death toll ranges from fifty to a hundred, although exact numbers are unknown. This number increases even more if the wounded who died in prisons or hospitals are included. Many participants were sentenced to death, prison, whippings, or deportation. The rebellion had nationwide repercussions. Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the &quot;malês&quot; very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made to force conversions to Catholicism and erase the popular memory of and affection towards Islam. However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.

===Muslim immigrants in Brazil===
Following the revolt of the Afro-Brazilian Muslim community, the next period of Islam in the country was primarily the result of Muslim immigration from the Middle East and South East Asia. Some 11 million Syrian and Lebanese (mostly Maronite and Orthodox Christians) immigrants live throughout Brazil. The biggest concentration of Muslims is found in the greater São Paulo region. There is also a growing Bangladeshi Brazilian community, numbering in the thousands.

Architecture and cuisine also bear the trademarks of the culture brought to the hemisphere by the Arabs. As an example, the second largest fast food chain in Brazil is Habib&#x27;s, which serves Arab food. The diversity of influence also stretches to businesses such as the textile industry, which is mostly run by merchants of Syrian-Lebanese origin (mainly of Christian faith). The São Paulo city council has a Muslim Councillor by the name of Mohammad Murad, a lawyer. A number of mosques dot the greater São Paulo area, the oldest and most popular of these being found on Avenida do Estado. Since its establishment, the mosque has added a Quranic school, library, kitchen and meeting hall for various functions.

==Today==
===Population===
According to the Brazilian census of 2010 there were 35,167 Muslims living in the country, primarily concentrated in the states of São Paulo and Paraná, compared to 22,450 Muslims in 1990 and 27,239 in 2000. There are significant Muslim communities in the industrial suburbs of the city of São Paulo and in the port city of Santos, as well as in smaller communities in Paraná State in the coastal region and in Curitiba and Foz do Iguaçu in the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay triborder area. The community is overwhelmingly Sunni; the Sunnis are almost completely assimilated into broader society. The recent Shi&#x27;ite immigrants gravitate to small insular communities in São Paulo, Curitiba, and Foz do Iguaçu.

A recent trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab citizens. A recent Muslim source estimated that there are close to 10,000 Muslim converts living in Brazil. During the past 30 years, Islam has become increasingly noticeable in Brazilian society by building not only mosques, but also libraries, arts centres, and schools and also by funding newspapers. The growth of Islam within Brazil is demonstrated in the fact that 2 of the 3 existing Portuguese translations of the Qur&#x27;an were created by Muslim translators in São Paulo.

According to the IBGE census, 83.2% of Muslims are self-declared as white, 12.2% are mixed, 3.8% black, 0.8% orientals and 0.04% indigenous. Almost all Brazilian Muslims (99,2%) have been living in urban areas. Despite 60% of Brazilian Muslims being men, 70% of converted Muslims are women.

===Infrastructure===

There are over 150 mosques in Brazil and the number is growing. As has been the case in many of the larger metropolitan mosques in South America, foreign assistance and individual effort have played major roles in the sustainability of the mosques in the greater São Paulo area. For example, the Imam of the Av. Do Estado Mosque is from the Middle East and often Imams are chosen jointly by the Mosques&#x27; management committees and the Arab governments that pay for the Imam&#x27;s services. Ismail Hatia, a South African who came to Brazil in 1956, built a mosque in Campinas many years ago. Hatia, who also runs a language school, felt that the approximately 50 Muslim families in Campinas were in dire need of some community organization to help provide cohesion and direction for the Muslims. The Campinas mosque now holds regular Friday juma&#x27;at prayers.

<text>Sergio Marchi, (born May 12, 1956), is a Canadian politician and former diplomat, who served as a federal Liberal Member of Parliament and cabinet minister and, later, as an ambassador.

Marchi was born in Argentina to an Italian family who subsequently emigrated to Canada.

He first entered politics at the municipal level, where he was elected Alderman for Ward 1 in North York (now part of Toronto) in 1982. He was subsequently elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1984 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto-area riding of York West.

When the Liberals came to power in the 1993 election, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien brought Marchi into the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. He also served as Minister of the Environment and Minister of International Trade in 1997.

Marchi left politics in 1999 and was appointed as Canadian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, and the UN Agencies, in Geneva. He served one term as Chairman of the WTO&#x27;s ruling council.

In 2005, it was reported in the media that Marchi might challenge incumbent David Miller for the Toronto mayoralty in the municipal election in 2006. Marchi said only that he was talking with people.

After leaving the diplomatic world, in February 2006, Marchi joined the Toronto law firm of Lang Michener LLP as a senior advisor, and also became President of the Canada China Business Council, and Chairman of the Canadian Services Coalition.

Marchi then took up a second tour in Geneva, to pursue a private sector opportunity, and established his own consultancy, the Marchi Group.

In February 2015, Marchi returned to Canada, where he was appointed President and CEO of the Canadian Electricity Association, headquartered in Ottawa.

<text>The Battle of Brześć Litewski (also known as the &quot;Siege of Brześć&quot;, &quot;Battle of Brest-Litovsk&quot; or simply &quot;Battle of Brześć&quot;) was a World War II battle involving German and Polish forces that took place between 14 and 17 September 1939, near the town of Brześć Litewski (now Brest, Belarus). After three days of heavy fights for the stronghold in the town of Brześć, the Germans captured the fortress and the Poles withdrew.

==History==
===Before the battle===
Initially, the Polish forces did not plan to defend the old fortress of Brześć. The town was located deep behind the Polish lines and was seen as a supply depot and organisation centre rather than a front-line fort. However, after the Battles of Mława and Wizna the German XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian broke through Polish lines and sped southward with the aim of flanking Warsaw from the East and cutting Poland in two.

According to the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939, the region of Brześć was assigned to the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. However, the Soviets did not begin their invasion of Poland yet, and had the rapidly advancing German corps stopped, it would give Poles time to regroup and prepare. Already on 8 September the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, notified the Soviet government that the German forces would have to violate the Soviet &quot;sphere&quot;.

The ancient fortress of Brześć is at the confluence of Muchawiec and Bug Rivers. Occupying the site of a medieval castle, it was strengthened and reconstructed in Napoleonic times and then again in 1847. Heavily damaged during World War I, the fortress was turned into a matériel depot and its central part into a prison. Although largely obsolete by contemporary standards, the fortress occupied a strategic position in the Polish lines and its defence could prevent German forces from crossing Polesia into Lesser Poland and Galicia to the south.

The aim of the German XIX Corps was to seize the fortress in order to prevent elements of a divided Independent Operational Group Narew under General Młot-Fijałkowski from retreating southwards and joining the rest of the Polish forces. The German forces consisted of an entire armoured corps: the 3rd Panzer, 2nd Motorised and 20th Motorised Divisions.

At the end of the summer the fortress was housing the march battalions of 82nd and 35th infantry regiments and elements of various smaller units. Moreover, a large number of newly mobilised reservists started to arrive at the fortress, awaiting forward deployment to their units. From these units General Konstanty Plisowski organized a force of roughly three infantry battalions, aided by an engineering battalion, several batteries of artillery and two companies of old FT-17 tanks used for training, Nos. 112 and 113.

===Opposing forces===
The city of Brześć was defended by a small improvised force under General Plisowski. The Polish forces consisted of three infantry battalions, one engineering battalion, some artillery and were assisted by two armoured trains (designated PP55 and PP53) commanded by Captains Mieczysław Malinowski and Andrzej Podgórski.

The German forces consisted of the entire XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian.

===Battle===
On 14 September 77 German tanks of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Panzer Regiment, part of 10th Panzer Division, reached the area of Brześć and attempted to capture the fortress on the run. The probe attack was repelled by Polish infantry and the 113th company of light tanks, consisting of 12 obsolete Renault FT tanks. All the Polish tanks were destroyed, but the German forces were forced to retreat towards their initial positions. Polish armoured train number 53 (PP53), which made a reconnaissance advance to Wysokie Litewskie, was attacked by a scout patrol from the 10th Panzer Division. The crew from the train opened fire with artillery. Several other skirmishes were fought, but were largely inconclusive.

Later that day the German artillery arrived and started bombardment of both the fortress and the town. Heavy street fighting ensued. At dawn approximately half of the town was in German hands, the other half being defended by Polish infantry. Polish anti-tank weapons, artillery and AA guns were very scarce and were unable provide enough support for the infantry. The following day Polish defenders withdrew from the town, but heavy casualties on both sides prevented the German units from continuing the attacks on the fortress. Instead, it was constantly shelled with artillery and bombed by the Luftwaffe.

When reports told Polish General Plisowski that scout elements from the 3rd Panzer Division were seen near the railway station at Żabinka, north of Kobryń, he sent PP55 to prevent his forces from being cut off. A platoon of five scout tanks left the train near Żabinka and attacked German armoured cars near a bridge on Muchawiec River. After three tanks were lost, the other two withdrew. A further attack by an assault platoon from the train failed. After a combined attack of the assault platoon and PP55 artillery, the Germans left the area of the Muchawiec bridge. When they returned, PP55 attacked another battle group of the 3rd Panzer Division (consisting of scout elements and the 5th Tank Regiment, supported by the 6th Battery of the 75th light artillery Regiment). After destroying a few armoured cars, the train withdrew towards Brześć and the train station was left in German hands.
The main assault finally started in the early morning of 16 September. The defenders had plenty of small arms ammunition and light arms thanks to the munitions depot in the fortress, but had almost no anti-tank weapons and insufficient artillery cover.

Although the German infantry was repelled and the assault of German tanks was stopped by two FT tanks sealing the northern gate of the fortress, by nightfall it became apparent that the German pressure made the situation very grave. Despite heavy losses, the German 20th Motorized Division and 10th Armoured Division captured the northern part of the citadel. Meanwhile, the combined 3rd Armoured Division and 2nd Armoured Division comprising the XXIInd Armoured Corps entered the area. The Poles were unable to resupply and the casualties rose to almost 40%.

At dawn General Plisowski ordered part of the Polish forces to retreat from the easternmost fortifications and regroup to the other side of the river and southwards. The evacuation was completed by early morning, 17 September when the last unit crossing the bridge blew it up to hinder the Germans. An hour later elements of the German 76th infantry regiment entered the fortress – almost unopposed.

==Aftermath==

On 17 September 1939 the Red Army crossed the Polish border and started its quick advance westwards. The Soviet 29th tank brigade under Brigadier Semyon Krivoshein reached the area of Brześć later that day and took over the fortress from the Wehrmacht. During that event a joint German-Soviet parade was held in the town, after which the German forces left the area, crossed the Bug River and started their pursuit of the fleeing forces of general Plisowski.

Some to the east the Polish improvised &quot;Kobryń&quot; Infantry Division under Colonel Epler was ordered to retreat in tandem with Plisowski. After the Battle of Kobryń the division evaded encirclement and joined the forces of General Plisowski. The Polish forces were soon joined by the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade and together started to make their way towards Lwów and the &quot;Romanian Bridgehead&quot;. Under command of General Franciszek Kleeberg they formed the bulwark of the remaining Polish Army, fighting effectively against both the Wehrmacht and Red Army until the Battle of Kock, that ended on 6 October 1939.

The Brest Fortress was handed over to the Soviets in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It was besieged and captured again by the Wehrmacht in the beginning of Operation Barbarossa conducted against Soviet Union in 1941.

<text>Westbury was a parliamentary constituency in Wiltshire from 1449 to 2010. It was represented in the House of Commons of England until 1707, and then in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800, and finally in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 until 2010.

Until 1885, it was a parliamentary borough, returning two Members of Parliament (MPs) until 1832 and only one from 1832 to 1885. The parliamentary borough was abolished in 1885, when the name was transferred to a county constituency returning one MP. Elections used the bloc vote system when two MPs were returned, and the first-past-the-post system of election when one seat was contested.

Westbury returned a Conservative Member at every election after 1924.

==Boundaries==

1885–1918: The Sessional Divisions of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Westbury, and Whorwellsdon, and part of the Sessional Division of Warminster.

1918–1950: The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Mere, Warminster, and Westbury and Whorwellsdown.

1950–1974: The Urban Districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster, and Westbury, and the Rural Districts of Bradford-on-Avon and Melksham, Mere and Tisbury, and Warminster and Westbury.

1974–1983: As prior but with redrawn boundaries.

1983–1997: The District of West Wiltshire, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.

1997–2010: The District of West Wiltshire wards of Adcroft, Bradford-on-Avon North, Bradford-on-Avon South, college, Corsley, Dilton Marsh, Drynham, Ethandune, Holt, John O&#x27;Gaunt, Manor Vale, Mid Wylye Valley, Park, Paxcroft, Shearwater, Summerham, Warminster East, Warminster West, Weavers, Westbrook, Westbury with Storridge, and Wylye Valley, and the District of Salisbury wards of Knoyle, Mere, and Western.

Originally a small pocket borough, covering only a small part of the parish of Westbury, in 1885 the parliamentary borough became a county constituency in Wiltshire. At the time of the constituency&#x27;s abolition in 2010 it included the towns of Westbury, Warminster, Trowbridge, and Bradford-on-Avon, and the surrounding rural areas as far south as Mere. Until boundary changes in 1997, it also included Melksham.

===Boundary review, 2005===
Following a review of parliamentary representation in Wiltshire, the Boundary Commission for England created two new constituencies in the county. Chippenham was created mostly from the adjoining North Wiltshire constituency, plus the town of Bradford-on-Avon at the northern end of the Westbury constituency, while the rest of Westbury saw minor changes to its composition and was renamed South West Wiltshire. These changes were approved in 2005, to take effect at the following general election, which ultimately took place in 2010.

<doc id="1177430" wikidata="Q7989642" url="?curid=1177430" title="Westron Wynde">
<text>Westron Wynde is an early 16th-century song whose tune was used as the basis (cantus firmus) of Masses by English composers John Taverner, Christopher Tye and John Sheppard. The tune first appears with words in a partbook of around 1530, catalogued by the British Library as Royal Appendix MS 58. Historians believe that the lyrics are a few hundred years older (&#x27;Middle English&#x27;) and the words are a fragment of medieval poetry.

==Lyrics==

The lyrics of the original, as transcribed by Charles Frey:

: Westron wynde when wyll thow blow
: the smalle rayne downe can Rayne
: Cryst yf my love were in my Armys
: And I yn my bed Agayne.

==Music==

Recovering the original tune of &quot;Westron Wynde&quot; that was used in these Masses is not entirely straightforward. There is a version that uses the secular words, but with rather different notes:

The version used by the three Mass composers can only be inferred by what they put into their Masses. In programme notes (see below), Peter Phillips offers the following reconstruction:

But this is not always exactly what appears in the Masses; thus the New Grove quotes the following sequence from Taverner&#x27;s Mass:

For the words being sung here, see Mass (music).

==Reworkings and Recordings==
&quot;Westron Wynde&quot; was put to music by Igor Stravinsky as a movement (&quot;Westron Wind&quot;) of his Cantata (1952).

The American folk group The Limeliters (Louis Gottlieb, Alex Hassilev, and Glenn Yarbrough) recorded a version using a variation of the first tune above, with modern English stanzas interpolated. Both the variation and the interpolated stanzas were most likely written by the Limeliters themselves, one of whom (Gottlieb) was a musicologist and would have been familiar with the original song.

The British guitarist John Renbourn recorded his own arrangement of the tune for two guitars on his 1970 album &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot;. The song has been recorded by Maddy Prior and Tim Hart on the album &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; and by Barbara Dickson on &quot;Full Circle&quot;.

The British band Current 93 recorded an extended and modified version of the song sometime between 1982 and 1995, adding various new lines. This version, however, was not released until 2010.

Susan McKeown and The Chanting House perform poet Robert Burns&#x27;s version of the song entitled &quot;Westlin Winds&quot; on the 1995 album &quot;Bones.&quot;

British composer Roger Jackson used the text and added a new verse in an entirely new setting in 2014.
:&quot;Eye of Heaven, pray gently smile,
:And though the cold wind blow,
:Soft, may you warm and mind my love
:That I do love her so&quot;

New Zealand composer Douglas Lilburn wrote a string quartet in 1939 entitled &quot;Phantasy&quot; based on a reworking of &quot;Westron Wynde&quot;. He undoubtedly modelled the work on his teacher Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (Lilburn was studying with Vaughan Williams at the time).

== Versions ==
Both simplified and distorted versions of this poem have been printed over the past many years. These include both tampered and accurately modernized versions. For example William Chappell inserted &#x27;O&#x27; at the start of the poem and replaced the word &#x27;Cryst&#x27; with &#x27;Oh&#x27; in his 1859 version. The latter was probably done to make it a safe reading for women and children in the 19th century context. He also included &#x27;doth&#x27; between &#x27;down&#x27; and &#x27;rayne&#x27; based on his probable interpretation that the wind did blow the rain away. Some modernization of spellings was done by other editors to make the poem accessible for modern reading.

==In popular culture==
The poem is used by:

*Ernest Hemingway in his novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1929).
*George Orwell in ch. 21 of his novel &quot;Burmese Days&quot; (1934).

*Charles Olson quotes the poem in &quot;Projective Verse&quot; (1950).
*Thomas Pynchon for the title of his first published story, &quot;The Small Rain&quot; (1959).
*Ezra Pound includes the poem in &quot;Confucius to Cummings,&quot; edited with Marcella Spann (1964).
*George Oppen alludes to the poem in &quot;O Western Wind&quot; (1962),&quot;The Little Pin: Fragment&quot; (1975) and &quot;Disasters&quot; (1976).
*Walter Tevis in his novel &quot;Mockingbird&quot; (1980).

<doc id="1177439" wikidata="Q836998" url="?curid=1177439" title="Saw-billed hermit">
<text>The saw-billed hermit (Ramphodon naevius) is a hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is endemic to Brazil.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The saw-billed hermit is placed in the hermit subfamily Phaethornithinae, but among these birds, it is the species most similar to the typical hummingbirds, Trochilinae. It is the only member of its genus and has no subspecies.

==Description==

The saw-billed hermit is long and weighs . It is one of the three heaviest hermits and the male is heavier than the female. Both sexes have saw-like serrations on the mandible and the male&#x27;s bill has a hooked tip as well. (The unrelated tooth-billed hummingbird (&quot;Androdon aequatorialis&quot;) is the only other hummingbird that has a serrated bill.) Both sexes have scaly brown upperparts and dark and pale striped underparts. They have a reddish ochre throat, a dark patch through the eye, and a white supercilium. The upper side of the tail is purplish black while the underside has progressively more buff at the ends to the outer pair of feathers.

==Distribution and habitat==

The saw-billed hermit is found in a narrow band of southeastern Brazil from the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo south to eastern Santa Catarina and northernmost Rio Grande do Sul. It inhabits the understory of the humid coastal Atlantic Forest up to an elevation of .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The saw-billed hermit is presumed to be sedentary, but there is speculation that it makes some short-range movements.

===Feeding===

The saw-billed hermit feeds on the nectar of a wide range of native and introduced flowering plants; most share the characteristic of tubular blossoms. It typically feeds within about of the ground but has been noted as high as . Like other hermit hummingbirds it is a &quot;trap-line&quot; feeder, visiting a circuit of flowering plants. However, unlike many other trap-liners it defends its route by aggressive behavior towards conspecific and other hummingbirds. In addition to nectar, it feeds on small arthropods gleaned from vegetation.

===Breeding===

The saw-billed hermit&#x27;s breeding season has not been fully defined but appears to include July to September. It builds its cone-shaped cup nest from plant material and cobwebs under the tip of a long drooping leaf. Its clutch is two eggs.

===Vocalization===

The saw-billed hermit&#x27;s song is a &quot;very high, chattering twitter&quot;. Calls include &quot;a sustained, rapid series of very high &#x27;bic&#x27; notes&quot; and &quot;a descending series...of &#x27;seee&#x27; notes.&quot; The calls are apparently used while defending the trap-line.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the saw-billed hermit as Least Concern. &quot;[It] is suspected to be declining moderately rapidly owing to habitat loss.&quot;

<text>Bangalla (), also known as Bengalla (in the 1996 movie adaptation), is a fictional African country from Lee Falk&#x27;s comic strip &quot;The Phantom&quot;. Bangalla is the home of the Phantom, who resides in the Deep Woods of the jungle in the fabled Skull Cave. Until the 1960s, the country was portrayed as being in Asia, near India. In the 1996 film, Bengalla is located in Asia instead of Africa. In the 2009 miniseries, Bangalla is a fictional small island nation located in the Malay Archipelago.

==Geography==
Bangalla is located in East Africa, around the approximate region of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. The capital of Bangalla is Mawitaan (formerly Morristown); other cities include Bengalitown, Sanloi, Spyglass and Mucar.

==Flag==
The daily strips beginning 14 Dec. 2018 (see also 11 Jan and 2 March 2019) depicted the Bangallan flag as a light blue field with a yellow crescent moon at the viewer&#x27;s left (i.e. a crescent Or at the hoist, its horns facing sinister), occupying the whole vertical width of the flag; and at the viewer&#x27;s right (heraldic sinister), a star of approximately 12 rays atop a besant (disk) of the same (i.e. also yellow). The position of these last two charges is sometimes reversed—possibly due to error on the part of the artist, Mike Manley, or to the flag being shown from the reverse. The flag bears some resemblance to the real-world flag of East Turkestan, while the smaller charges recall those on the flag of Nepal. Since the crescent generally symbolizes Islam, its appearance on the flag of Bangalla (which has never been depicted as a majority-Muslim nation) represents something of an oddity.

==Regime==
Bangalla is a former British colony that since became a democracy. The country&#x27;s first president was Lamanda Luaga, a doctor elected to office after having fought an epidemic in the jungle. However, General Bababu seized control of the country and, after announcing that Luaga was dead, searched for Luaga to kill him and exhibit his head as proof. The Phantom, however, abducted Bababu and brought him to the Deep Woods where Luaga defeated him in a fair one-on-one fight. The Council of Chiefs sentenced Bababu to two years&#x27; hard labor at each of the 12 tribal nations. General Bababu has, however, never given up the hopes of becoming dictator of Bangalla and has been a recurring villain in &quot;Phantom&quot; lore, usually in cooperation with other dictators who seek a marionette-president.

===According to Team Fantomen===
After the above events, Team Fantomen added its own twists to the politics of Bangalla. Luaga lost a re-election bid to the pathologically evil Kigali Lubanga, who ruled the country as a dictator during the non-comics-world years of 1994–1996, before he was apparently killed and Luaga came back to take control of a country that was in uproar.

Lubanga has since shown up on several occasions to haunt the Phantom and try to take power. Although Luaga was able to imprison him, Lubanga had destroyed all evidence against him so he could never be convicted in a fair trial. After Lubanga escaped, it became known that Luaga had kept him imprisoned for years, which came across as a greedy political decision to get rid of a rival. Luaga then resigned, after which Lubanga tried to take power but was hindered by the Phantom, and disappeared.

Sandal Singh, leader of the Singh Brotherhood, was subsequently elected president, an office she held in stories produced until 2015.

==Neighbouring countries==
Bangalla is also near Ivory Lana (also called &quot;Fari Lana&quot;), whose president Goranda is a friend of Luaga and Rodia (also written &quot;Rhodia&quot;).

==Laws and Constitution==

The Constitution of Bangalla is much like the United States Constitution

;The Executive Branch : The executive branch of the constitution mandates a president of the Republic of Bangalla, a vice president and a cabinet of ministers. The president and vice president are elected for a five-year term. The next presidential election will be held in 2020.

;The Legislative Branch : The legislative branch is made up of a senate and a house of representatives. The members of the senate are elected for six-year terms and are chosen from each of Bangalla&#x27;s 33 provinces, three from each province. The members of the house of representatives, of which there are 400, are elected for two-year terms.

;The Judiciary Branch : The judiciary branch is made up of a supreme court and lesser courts. The supreme court consists of nine justices. Recent events have established that the president has the power to suspend the laws. President Luaga, for instance, suspended the rules against striking or assaulting the president, in an effort to have a fair fistfight with a citizen. Such an exhibition of power suggests that the legislature of Bangalla is weaker than those in many commonwealth countries.

===Citizens===
Bangalla is unique in that one of its citizens is a mountain wolf named Mr. Devil, a faithful companion to the Phantom.

==Presidents of Bangalla==
===According to the newspaper strip===
#Lamanda Luaga, Independence declaration-still holding office

===According to Team Fantomen===
#Lamanda Luaga, Independence declaration-1994
#Kigali Lubanga, 1994–1996
#Lamanda Luaga, 1996–2005, resigned after a scandal involving holding opponent Lubanga, who was imprisoned without trial
#Sandal Singh, 2007–2015, leader of the Singh Brotherhood

<text>Fila Brazillia is an English electronica duo from Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, England, formed in 1990 by Steve Cobby and David McSherry.

==History==
Their early albums were released on Pork Recordings, also based in Hull: &quot;Old Codes New Chaos&quot;, &quot;Maim That Tune&quot;, &quot;Mess&quot;, &quot;Black Market Gardening&quot;, &quot;Luck Be a Weirdo Tonight&quot; and &quot;Power Clown&quot;. After creating their own music label with Sim Lister, Twentythree Records, they released further albums &quot;A Touch of Cloth&quot;, &quot;Jump Leads&quot;, &quot;The Life And Times of Phoebus Brumal&quot;, &quot;Dicks&quot; and &quot;Retrospective&quot;.
They have also released two DJ mix albums, &quot;Another Late Night: Fila Brazillia&quot;, for Azuli Records&#x27; &quot;Another Late Night&quot; series, and &quot;Another Fine Mess: Fila Brazillia&quot;, and two collections of remixes: &quot;Brazilification&quot; and &quot;B2&quot;.

Their collaborations include working with Harold Budd and Bill Nelson to release &quot;Three White Roses &amp; A Budd&quot; (Twentythree Records, 2002).
They co-produced the first Twilight Singers LP &quot;Twilight as Played by The Twilight Singers&quot; with Greg Dulli in 2001.
Cobby and McSherry have produced more than 70 remixes for artists including Black Uhuru, Busta Rhymes, DJ Food, Lamb, Radiohead and The Orb.
Bill Hicks, the controversial American stand-up comedian, satirist and social critic, &quot;appears&quot; on Fila Brazillia&#x27;s album &quot;Maim That Tune&quot; (1996) and the album is dedicated to Hicks.

Their music has made its mark both on small-screen blockbusters (such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot;) and cult cinema films such as &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot;, &quot;Riding Giants&quot; and &quot;Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos&quot;, a 2006 documentary about the New York Cosmos soccer team.
One of their better-known songs, &quot;A Zed and two L&#x27;s&quot;, appears on &quot;Jam&quot;, a black comedy sketch show by British satirist Chris Morris.
Their song &quot;Here Comes Pissy Willy&quot; from the &quot;Power Clown&quot; album featured as the theme to the &quot;James Whale Show&quot; on Talk Radio in the late 1990s.

After releasing their &quot;Retrospective&quot; album in 2006, Cobby and McSherry quietly ended their longtime partnership. Currently, McSherry is a lecturer in Sound and Music Production at the University of Lincoln.

Cobby went on in late 2006 to form Steel Tiger Records with Sim Lister. Over the course of 2007, the label saw various digital releases by J*S*T*A*R*S (Cobby and Lister), Peacecorps (Cobby and guitarist Rich Arthurs) and by The Cutler (Cobby and ex-head of Pork Recordings David &quot;Porky&quot; Brennand).
The first formal album by The Cutler on Steel Tiger Records was released on 7 July 2008, and the most recent &quot;Everything Is Touching Everything Else&quot; (Steel Tiger Records ST016, 10 June 2013) – with vocals by Isobel Helen, Archie Heselwood, Andrew Taylor and Little Glitches – distributed by Kudos Records Ltd.

In 2013 Steve Cobby provided the soundtrack for the Hull &#x27;UK City of Culture 2017&#x27; bid film - &#x27;This City Belongs to Everyone&#x27;, produced by Nova Studios - on 20 November 2013 Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, was announced as the winning City, and so as UK City of Culture 2017.

After a 16 year hiatus, on 6 March 2020, the band returned with the release of the MMXX EP.

In 2023, they appear to have released the Subtle Body album/EP, with two original tracks and two unreleased versions.

<text>The Magician is a novel by British author W. Somerset Maugham, originally published in 1908. In this tale, the magician Oliver Haddo, a caricature of Aleister Crowley, attempts to create life. Crowley wrote a critique of this book under the pen name Oliver Haddo, in which he accused Maugham of plagiarism.

Maugham wrote &quot;The Magician&quot; in London, after he had spent some time living in Paris, where he met Aleister Crowley. The novel was later republished with a foreword by Maugham entitled &quot;A Fragment of Autobiography&quot;.

The novel inspired a film of the same name directed in 1926 by Rex Ingram.

==Plot summary==
Arthur Burdon, a renowned English surgeon, is visiting Paris to see his fiancée, Margaret Dauncey. Margaret is studying art in a Parisian school, along with her friend Susie Boyd. On his first evening in Paris, Burdon meets Oliver Haddo, who claims to be a magician and is an acquaintance of Burdon&#x27;s mentor, the retired doctor and occult scholar Dr. Porhoët. While none of the company initially believe Haddo&#x27;s claims, Haddo performs several feats of magic for them over the following days. Arthur eventually fights with Haddo, after the magician kicks Margaret&#x27;s dog.

In revenge, Haddo uses both his personality and his magic to seduce Margaret, despite her initial revulsion towards him. They get married and run away from Paris, leaving merely a note to inform Arthur, Susie and Porhoët. Arthur is distraught at the abandonment and promptly returns to England to immerse himself in his work. By this time Susie has fallen in love with Arthur, although she realises that this love will never be returned, and she goes away to Italy with a friend.

During her travels, Susie hears much about the new Mr. and Mrs. Haddo, including a rumour that their marriage has not been consummated. When she eventually returns to England, she meets up with Arthur and they go to a dinner party held by a mutual acquaintance. To their horror, the Haddos are at this dinner party, and Oliver takes great delight in gloating at Arthur&#x27;s distress.

The next day, Arthur goes to the hotel at which Margaret is staying, and whisks her away to a house in the country. Although she files for divorce from Haddo, his influence on her proves too strong, and she ends up returning to him. Feeling that this influence must be supernatural, Susie returns to France to consult with Dr Porhoët on a possible solution.

Several weeks later, Arthur joins them in Paris and reveals that he visited Margaret at Haddo&#x27;s home and that she suggested her life was threatened by her new husband. She implies that Haddo is only waiting for the right time to perform a magical ritual, which will involve the sacrifice of her life. Arthur travels to Paris to ask for Porhoët&#x27;s advice. A week later, Arthur has an overwhelming feeling that Margaret&#x27;s life is in danger, and all three rush back to England.

When they arrive at Skene, Haddo&#x27;s ancestral home in the village of Venning, they are told by the local innkeeper that Margaret has died of a heart attack. Believing that Haddo has murdered her, Arthur confronts first the local doctor and then Haddo himself with his suspicions. Searching for proof of foul play, Arthur persuades Porhoët to raise Margaret&#x27;s ghost from the dead, which proves to them that she was murdered. Eventually, Haddo uses his magic to appear in their room at the local inn, where Arthur kills him. However, when the light is turned on Haddo&#x27;s body has disappeared.

The trio visit Haddo&#x27;s abandoned home to find that he has used his magic to create life – hideous creatures living in tubes – and that this is the purpose for which he sacrificed Margaret&#x27;s life. After finding the magician&#x27;s dead body in his attic, Arthur sets fire to the manor to destroy all evidence of Haddo&#x27;s occult experiments.

==Maugham&#x27;s comments==
In 1956, nearly fifty years after the publication of &quot;The Magician&quot;, Maugham commented on the book in &quot;A Fragment of Autobiography&quot;. He writes that by then he had almost completely forgotten the book, and, on rereading it, found the writing &quot;lush and turgid&quot;, using more adverbs and adjectives than he would at that later date, and notes that he must have been trying to emulate the &quot;écriture artiste&quot; (artistic writing) of the French writers of the time. The plot bears some resemblance to George du Maurier&#x27;s 1894 novel &quot;Trilby&quot;. Maugham also comments that he must have spent days and days reading in the library of the British Museum in order to come by all the material on the black arts.

==Crowley&#x27;s allegations of plagiarism==
In the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Aleister Crowley wrote, under the pen name Oliver Haddo, &quot;How to Write a Novel! (After W. S. Maugham)&quot;, a review of &quot;The Magician&quot; in which he accused Maugham of having plagiarised the following books in writing the novel:
*&quot;The Island of Dr Moreau&quot; by H. G. Wells
*&quot;Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers
*&quot;The Life of Paracelsus&quot; by Franz Hartmann.
*&quot;Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie&quot; by Eliphas Levi, translated by A. E. Waite
*&quot;The Blossom and the Fruit&quot;, by Mabel Collins

Most critics consider that the above works were merely sources for an original story, and that Crowley&#x27;s accusation was motivated by malice. The large body of original work turned out by Maugham before and after 1908 tends to support this. In &quot;A Fragment of Autobiography&quot; Maugham writes he had not read Crowley&#x27;s review, adding, &quot;I daresay it was a pretty piece of vituperation, but probably, like his poems, intolerably verbose.&quot;

<text>Port Stanley is a community in the Municipality of Central Elgin, Elgin County in Ontario, Canada. It is located on the north shore of Lake Erie at the mouth of Kettle Creek. In 2016, it had a population of 2,148.

==History==
The site of Port Stanley was part of an important early route from Lake Erie to other inland waterways for a succession of explorers and travellers of the 17th and 18th centuries. It was an important landing point and camping spot. Adrien Jolliet, brother of Louis Jolliet, landed at this location in 1669 during the first exploration of the Great Lakes by Europeans. Other notable visitors included François Dollier de Casson and René de Bréhant de Galinée (1670), Jean-Baptiste Céloron de Blainville (1749) and Sir William Johnson (1761). In commemoration of this role, a site bounded by Bridge, Main and Colbourne Streets was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923, and was marked with a cairn.

Lieutenant-Colonel John Bostwick received the first land grant, and settled in what is now Port Stanley in 1804. Around 1824, it was renamed Port Stanley after Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, who had visited nearby Port Talbot. Lord Stanley later became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the father of Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, Governor General of Canada, ice hockey enthusiast and donor of the first Stanley Cup in 1893.

==Economy==
Port Stanley has a large sheltered harbour that was operated by Transport Canada, but has been divested to the Municipality of Central Elgin. Historically, these facilities supported trade in coal and wood between Southwestern Ontario and the United States. Today, most of these facilities are dormant, but a commercial freshwater fishery operates from the harbour.

==Attractions==
Attractions include a large sandy beach, King George VI Lift Bridge (a lifting bridge across Kettle Creek opened in May 1939), marinas, restaurants, hotels, shops, the Port Stanley Festival Theatre in the former town hall building on Bridge Street, and the Port Stanley Terminal Rail, which operates a tourist train between St. Thomas, Ontario and Port Stanley using a portion of the former L&amp;PS rail line, the London and Port Stanley Railway.

In 1926, the L&amp;PS Pavilion opened. It was later renamed the Stork Club (not to be confused with the famous New York establishment), and had a dance floor, the largest dance floor in the London-Port Stanley area; the club was famous for swing dance and big band and attracted several big names to play there. It was closed by health authorities in 1973 because it could not earn the revenue to keep the building up. H.J. McManus, a London businessman, bought it and his son, Joe Jr., led the renovations, reopening in 1974 with the Harry James Orchestra performing before a sellout crowd. The last event was a performance by Day Break on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1978/79; a fire in a dumpster 12 days later damaged the building too heavily to save it.

In the first decade of the 21st century, there were numerous proposals to operate a ferry between Port Stanley and Cleveland, Ohio.

==Media==
&quot;The Port Stanley News&quot; was formerly a locally operated news and current events Website/blog that served the Port Stanley area however it is no longer active.

&quot;The Lake Erie Beacon&quot; was a tabloid community newspaper published bi-weekly, with a distribution of 7000 printed copies and 800 electronic copies however it has ceased publication.

==Climate==
Port Stanley has a humid continental climate modified somewhat by the waters of Lake Erie.

<doc id="1177467" wikidata="Q46994" url="?curid=1177467" title="Telehealth">
<text>Telehealth is the distribution of health-related services and information via electronic information and telecommunication technologies. It allows long-distance patient and clinician contact, care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions. Telemedicine is sometimes used as a synonym, or is used in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services, such as diagnosis and monitoring. When rural settings, lack of transport, a lack of mobility, conditions due to outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, decreased funding, or a lack of staff restrict access to care, telehealth may bridge the gap
as well as provide distance-learning; meetings, supervision, and presentations between practitioners; online information and health data management and healthcare system integration. Telehealth could include two clinicians discussing a case over video conference; a robotic surgery occurring through remote access; physical therapy done via digital monitoring instruments, live feed and application combinations; tests being forwarded between facilities for interpretation by a higher specialist; home monitoring through continuous sending of patient health data; client to practitioner online conference; or even videophone interpretation during a consult.

== Telehealth versus telemedicine ==
Telehealth is sometimes discussed interchangeably with telemedicine, the latter being more common than the former. The Health Resources and Services Administration distinguishes telehealth from telemedicine in its scope, defining telemedicine only as describing remote clinical services, such as diagnosis and monitoring, while telehealth includes preventative, promotive, and curative care delivery. This includes the above-mentioned non-clinical applications, like administration and provider education.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services states that the term telehealth includes &quot;non-clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings, and continuing medical education&quot;, and that the term telemedicine means &quot;remote clinical services&quot;.
The World Health Organization uses telemedicine to describe all aspects of health care including preventive care. The American Telemedicine Association uses the terms telemedicine and telehealth interchangeably, although it acknowledges that telehealth is sometimes used more broadly for remote health not involving active clinical treatments.

eHealth is another related term, used particularly in the U.K. and Europe, as an umbrella term that includes telehealth, electronic medical records, and other components of health information technology. 

== Methods and modalities ==

Telehealth requires good Internet access by participants, usually in the form of a strong, reliable broadband connection, and broadband mobile communication technology of at least the fourth generation (4G) or long-term evolution (LTE) standard to overcome issues with video stability and bandwidth restrictions. As broadband infrastructure has improved, telehealth usage has become more widely feasible.

Healthcare providers often begin telehealth with a needs assessment which assesses hardships which can be improved by telehealth such as travel time, costs or time off work. Collaborators, such as technology companies can ease the transition.

Delivery can come within four distinct domains: live video (synchronous), store-and-forward (asynchronous), remote patient monitoring, and mobile health. Audio-based telemedicine, primarily through telephone consultations, has been studied as a tool for managing chronic conditions. A systematic review of 40 randomized controlled trials found that audio-based care was generally comparable to in-person or video care, though with low to very low certainty of evidence.

=== Store and forward ===
Store-and-forward telemedicine involves acquiring medical data (like medical images, biosignals etc.) and then transmitting this data to a doctor or medical specialist at a convenient time for assessment offline. It does not require the presence of both parties at the same time. Dermatology (cf: teledermatology), radiology, and pathology are common specialties that are conducive to asynchronous telemedicine. A properly structured medical record preferably in electronic form should be a component of this transfer. The &#x27;store-and-forward&#x27; process requires the clinician to rely on a history report and audio/video information in lieu of a physical examination.

=== Remote monitoring ===

Remote monitoring, also known as self-monitoring or testing, enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various technological devices. This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases or specific conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or asthma. These services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional in-person patient encounters, supply greater satisfaction to patients, and may be cost-effective. Examples include home-based nocturnal dialysis and improved joint management.

=== Real-time interactive ===
Electronic consultations are possible through interactive telemedicine services which provide real-time interactions between patient and provider. Videoconferencing has been used in a wide range of clinical disciplines and settings for various purposes including management, diagnosis, counseling and monitoring of patients.

=== Videotelephony ===

Videotelephony comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real-time.

At the dawn of the technology, videotelephony also included &quot;image phones&quot; which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional POTS-type telephone lines, essentially the same as slow scan TV systems.

Currently, videotelephony is particularly useful to the deaf and speech-impaired who can use them with sign language and also with a video relay service, and well as to those with mobility issues or those who are located in distant places and are in need of telemedical or tele-educational services.

==Categories==
=== Emergency care ===

Common daily emergency telemedicine is performed by SAMU Regulator Physicians in France, Spain, Chile and Brazil. Aircraft and maritime emergencies are also handled by SAMU centres in Paris, Lisbon and Toulouse.

A recent study identified three major barriers to adoption of telemedicine in emergency and critical care units. They include:
* Regulatory challenges: related to the difficulty and cost of obtaining licensure across multiple states, malpractice protection and privileges at multiple facilities
* Financial barrier: lack of acceptance and reimbursement by government payers and some commercial insurance carriers, which places the investment burden squarely upon the hospital or healthcare system.
* Cultural barriers: occurring from the lack of desire, or unwillingness, of some physicians to adapt clinical paradigms for telemedicine applications.
Emergency Telehealth is also gaining acceptance in the United States. There are several modalities currently being practiced that include but are not limited to TeleTriage, TeleMSE and ePPE.

An example of telehealth in the field is when EMS arrives on scene of an incident and is able to take an EKG that is then sent directly to a physician at the hospital to be read. Therefore, allowing instant care and management.

=== Telenursing ===
Telenursing refers to the use of telecommunications and information technology in order to provide nursing services in health care whenever a large physical distance exists between patient and nurse, or between any number of nurses. As a field it is part of telehealth, and has many points of contacts with other medical and non-medical applications, such as telediagnosis, teleconsultation, telemonitoring, etc.

Telenursing is achieving significant growth rates in many countries due to several factors: the preoccupation in reducing the costs of health care, an increase in the number of aging and chronically ill population, and the increase in coverage of health care to distant, rural, small or sparsely populated regions. Among its benefits, telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses; to reduce distances and save travel time, and to keep patients out of hospital. A greater degree of job satisfaction has been registered among telenurses.

In Australia, during January 2014, Melbourne tech startup Small World Social collaborated with the Australian Breastfeeding Association to create the first hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application for new mothers. The application, named Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial, allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues (latching on, posture etc.) or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout, who can view the issue through the mother&#x27;s Google Glass camera. The trial was successfully concluded in Melbourne in April 2014, and 100% of participants were breastfeeding confidently.

=== Telepalliative care ===
Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach aimed at optimizing quality of life and mitigating suffering among people with serious, complex, and often terminal illnesses. In the past, palliative care was a disease specific approach, but today the World Health Organization (WHO) takes a broader approach suggesting that palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and fatal illness. As in many aspects of healthcare, telehealth is increasingly being used in palliative care and is often referred to as telepalliative care. The types of technology applied in telepalliative care are typically telecommunication technologies, such as video conferencing or messaging for follow-up, or digital symptom assessments through digital questionnaires generating alerts to health care professionals. Telepalliative care has been shown to be a feasible approach to deliver palliative care among patients, caregivers and health care professionals. Telepalliative care can provide an added support system that enable patients to remain at home through self-reporting of symptoms and tailoring care to specific patients. Studies have shown that the use of telehealth in palliative care is mostly well received by patients, and that telepalliative care may improve access to health care professionals at home and enhance feelings of security and safety among patients receiving palliative care. Further, telepalliative care may enable more efficient utilization of healthcare resources, promotes collaboration between different levels of healthcare and makes healthcare professionals more responsive to changes in patients&#x27; condition.

Challenging aspects of the use of telehealth in palliative care have also been described. Generally, palliative care is a diverse medical specialty, involving interdisciplinary professionals from different professional traditions and cultures, delivering care to a heterogenous cohort of patients with diverse diseases, conditions and symptoms. This makes it a challenge to develop telehealth that is suitable for all patients and in all contexts of palliative care. Some of the barriers to telepalliative care relate to inflexible reporting of complex and fluctuating symptoms and circumstances using electronic questionnaires. Further, palliative care emphasizes a holistic approach that should address existential, spiritual and mental distress related to serious illness. However, few studies have included the self-reporting of existential or spiritual concerns, emotions, and well-being. Healthcare professionals may also be uncomfortable providing emotional or psychological care remotely. Palliative care has been characterized as high-touch rather than high-tech, limiting the interest in applying technological advancements when developing interventions. To optimize the advantages and minimize the challenges with the use of telehealth in home-based palliative care, future research should include users in the design and development process. Understanding the potential of telehealth to support therapeutic relationships between patients and health care professionals and being aware of the possible difficulties and tensions it may create are critical to its successful and acceptable use.

=== Telepharmacy ===
Telepharmacy is the delivery of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs, and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities. This approach allows patients in remote or underserved areas to receive pharmacy services that would otherwise be unavailable to them, enhancing access to care and ensuring continuity in medication management. Health outcomes appear similar when pharmacy services are delivered by telepharmacy compared to traditional service delivery.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.

=== Telepsychiatry ===
=== Teledentistry ===

Teledentistry is the use of information technology and telecommunications for dental care, consultation, education, and public awareness in the same manner as telehealth and telemedicine.

=== Teleaudiology ===

Tele-audiology is the utilization of telehealth to provide audiological services and may include the full scope of audiological practice. This term was first used by Gregg Givens in 1999 in reference to a system being developed at East Carolina University in North Carolina, US.

=== Teleneurology ===
Teleneurology describes the use of mobile technology to provide neurological care remotely, including care for stroke, movement disorders like Parkinson&#x27;s disease, seizure disorders (e.g., epilepsy), etc. The use of teleneurology gives us the opportunity to improve health care access for billions around the globe, from those living in urban locations to those in remote, rural locations. Evidence shows that individuals with Parkinson&#x27;s disease prefer personal connection with a remote specialist to their local clinician. Such home care is convenient but requires access to and familiarity with internet. A 2017 randomized controlled trial of &quot;virtual house calls&quot; or video visits with individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease evidences patient preference for the remote specialist vs their local clinician after one year. Teleneurology for patients with Parkison&#x27;s disease is found to be cheaper than in person visits by reducing transportation and travel time A recent systematic review by Ray Dorsey et al. describes both the limitations and potential benefits of teleneurology to improve care for patients with chronic neurological conditions, especially in low-income countries. White, well educated and technologically savvy people are the biggest consumers of telehealth services for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. as compared to ethnic minorities in the US.

=== Teleneurosurgery ===

Telemedicine in neurosurgery was historically primarily used for follow-up visits by patients that had to travel far to undergo surgery. In the last decade, telemedicine was also used for remote ICU rounding as well as prompt evaluation for acute ischemic stroke and administration of IV alteplase in conjunction with Neurology. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapid surge in the use of telemedicine across all divisions of neurosurgery: vascular, oncology, spine, and functional neurosurgery. Not only for follow-up visits, but it has gained popularity for seeing new patients or following established patients regardless of whether they underwent surgery. Telemedicine is not limited to direct patient care only; there are a number of new research groups and companies focused on using telemedicine for clinical trials involving patients with neurosurgical diagnoses.

=== Teleneuropsychology ===
Teleneuropsychology is the use of telehealth/videoconference technology for the remote administration of neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological tests are used to evaluate the cognitive status of individuals with known or suspected brain disorders and provide a profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Through a series of studies, there is growing support in the literature showing that remote videoconference-based administration of many standard neuropsychological tests results in test findings that are similar to traditional in-person evaluations, thereby establishing the basis for the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychological assessment.

=== Telenutrition ===
Telenutrition refers to the use of video conferencing/ telephony to provide online consultation by a nutritionist or dietician. Patient or clients upload their vital statistics, diet logs, food pictures etc. on a telenutrition portal which are then used by nutritionist or dietician to analyze their current health condition. Nutritionist or dietician can then set goals for their respective client/ patients and monitor their progress regularly by follow-up consultations.

Telenutrition portals can help people seek remote consultation for themselves and/or their family. This can be extremely helpful for elderly or bed ridden patients who can consult their dietician from comfort of their homes.

Telenutrition showed to be feasible and the majority of patients trusted the nutritional televisits, in place of the scheduled but not provided follow-up visits during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Telerehabilitation ===
Telerehabilitation (or &quot;e-rehabilitation&quot;) is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunication networks and the Internet. Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient&#x27;s functional abilities in his or her environment), and clinical therapy. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: neuropsychology, speech–language pathology, audiology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a clinic because the patient has a disability or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.

Most telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are webcams, videoconferencing, phone lines, videophones and webpages containing rich web applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for neuropsychological rehabilitation; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as wheelchairs, braces or artificial limbs; and in speech-language pathology. Rich web applications for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka cognitive rehabilitation) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a teletherapy application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. Tele-audiology (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Physical therapy and psychology interventions delivered via telehealth may result in similar outcomes as those delivered in-person for a range of health conditions.

Two important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in telehaptics (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.

In the United States, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research&#x27;s (NIDRR) supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR&#x27;s grantees include the &quot;Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center&quot; (RERC) at the University of Pittsburgh, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the Veterans Health Administration, the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense. Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.

Only a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs, reimburse for telerehabilitation services. If the research shows that teleassessments and teletherapy are equivalent to clinical encounters, it is more likely that insurers and Medicare will cover telerehabilitation services.

In India, the Indian Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (IACP) provides telerehabilitation facilities. With the support and collaboration of local clinics and private practitioners and the Members IACP, IACP runs the facility, named Telemedicine. IACP has maintained an internet-based list of their members on their website, through which patients can make online appointments.

=== Teletrauma care ===
Telemedicine can be utilized to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of care in a trauma environment. Examples include:

Telemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.

Telemedicine for intensive care unit (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient&#x27;s bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient&#x27;s wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.

Telemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology. Each lecture provides fundamental principles, firsthand knowledge and evidenced-based methods for critical analysis of established clinical practice standards, and comparisons to newer advanced alternatives. The various sites collaborate and share their perspective based on location, available staff, and available resources.

Telemedicine in the trauma operating room: trauma surgeons are able to observe and consult on cases from a remote location using video conferencing. This capability allows the attending to view the residents in real time. The remote surgeon has the capability to control the camera (pan, tilt and zoom) to get the best angle of the procedure while at the same time providing expertise in order to provide the best possible care to the patient.

=== Telecardiology ===
ECGs, or electrocardiographs, can be transmitted using telephone and wireless. Willem Einthoven, the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.

==== Transmission of ECGs ====
One of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.

This system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500 Hz to 2500 Hz with 1500 Hz at baseline.

This system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.

In addition, electronic stethoscopes can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.

In Pakistan three pilot projects in telemedicine were initiated by the Ministry of IT &amp; Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients were treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.

Wireless ambulatory ECG technology, moving beyond previous ambulatory ECG technology such as the Holter monitor, now includes smartphones and Apple Watches which can perform at-home cardiac monitoring and send the data to a physician via the internet.

=== Teleradiology ===

Teleradiology is the ability to send radiographic images (x-rays, CT, MR, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, MG, US...) from one location to another. For this process to be implemented, three essential components are required, an image sending station, a transmission network, and a receiving-image review station. The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.

The teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.

Today&#x27;s high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard personal computer (PC) and digital subscriber line (DSL) connection is enough to reach Keosys&#x27; central server. No particular software is necessary on the PC and the images can be reached from anywhere in the world.

Teleradiology is the most popular use for telemedicine and accounts for at least 50% of all telemedicine usage.

=== Telepathology ===
Telepathology is the practice of pathology at a distance. It uses telecommunications technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of diagnosis, education, and research. Performance of telepathology requires that a pathologist selects the video images for analysis and the rendering diagnoses. The use of &quot;television microscopy&quot;, the forerunner of telepathology, did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual &quot;hands-on&quot; involvement is the selection of microscopic fields-of-view for analysis and diagnosis.

A pathologist, Ronald S. Weinstein, M.D., coined the term &quot;telepathology&quot; in 1986. In an editorial in a medical journal, Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services. He, and his collaborators, published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology. Weinstein was also granted the first U.S. patents for robotic telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks. Weinstein is known to many as the &quot;father of telepathology&quot;. In Norway, Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989. This is still in operation, decades later. A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications including the rendering histopathology tissue diagnoses, at a distance, for education, and for research. Although digital pathology imaging, including virtual microscopy, is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries, analog telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries.

=== Teledermatology ===
Teledermatology allows dermatology consultations over a distance using audio, visual and data communication, and has been found to improve efficiency, access to specialty care, and patient satisfaction. Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment as well as (continuing medical) education. The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term &quot;teledermatology&quot; in 1995, where they described the value of a teledermatologic service in a rural area underserved by dermatologists.

=== Teleophthalmology ===

Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital medical equipment and telecommunications technology. Today, applications of teleophthalmology encompass access to eye specialists for patients in remote areas, ophthalmic disease screening, diagnosis and monitoring; as well as distant learning. Teleophthalmology may help reduce disparities by providing remote, low-cost screening tests such as diabetic retinopathy screening to low-income and uninsured patients. In Mizoram, India, a hilly area with poor roads, between 2011 and 2015, teleophthalmology provided care to over 10,000 patients. These patients were examined by ophthalmic assistants locally but surgery was done on appointment after the patient images were viewed online by eye surgeons in the hospital 6–12 hours away. Instead of an average five trips for say, a cataract procedure, only one was required for surgery alone as even post-op care like removal of stitches and appointments for glasses was done locally. There were large cost savings in travel as well.

In the United States, some companies allow patients to complete an online visual exam and within 24 hours receive a prescription from an optometrist valid for eyeglasses, contact lenses, or both. Some US states such as Indiana have attempted to ban these companies from doing business.

=== Telesurgery ===
Remote surgery (also known as telesurgery) is the ability for a doctor to perform surgery on a patient even though they are not physically in the same location. It is a form of telepresence. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics, cutting-edge telecommunications such as high-speed data connections, telehaptics and elements of management information systems. While the field of robotic surgery is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery.

Remote surgery is remote work for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.

Remote surgery or telesurgery is performance of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically in the same location as the patient, using a robotic teleoperator system controlled by the surgeon. The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, latency and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.

=== Teleabortion ===

Telemedicine has been used globally to increase access to abortion care, specifically medical abortion, in environments where few abortion care providers exist or abortion is legally restricted. Clinicians are able to virtually provide counseling, review screening tests, observe the administration of an abortion medication, and directly mail abortion pills to people. In 2004, Women on Web (WoW), Amsterdam, started offering online consultations, mostly to people living in areas where abortion was legally restricted, informing them how to safely use medical abortion drugs to end a pregnancy. People contact the Women on Web service online; physicians review any necessary lab results or ultrasounds, mail mifepristone and misoprostol pills to people, then follow up through online communication. In the United States, medical abortion was introduced as a telehealth service in Iowa by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland in 2008 to allow a patient at one health facility to communicate via secure video with a health provider at another facility. In this model a person seeking abortion care must come to a health facility. An abortion care provider communicates with the person located at another site using clinic-to-clinic videoconferencing to provide medical abortion after screening tests and consultation with clinic staff. In 2018, the website Aid Access was launched by the founder of Women on Web, Rebecca Gomperts. It offers a similar service as Women on Web in the United States, but the medications are prescribed to an Indian pharmacy, then mailed to the United States.

The TelAbortion study conducted by Gynuity Health Projects, with special approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aims to increase access to medical abortion care without requiring an in-person visit to a clinic. This models was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic and as of March 2020 exists in 13 U.S. states and has enrolled over 730 people in the study. The person receives counseling and instruction from an abortion care provider via videoconference from a location of their choice. The medications necessary for the abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are mailed directly to the person and they have a follow-up video consultation in 7–14 days. A systematic review of telemedicine abortion has found the practice to be safe, effective, efficient, and satisfactory.

In the United States, eighteen states require the clinician to be physically present during the administration of medications for abortion which effectively bans telehealth of medication abortion: five states explicitly ban telemedicine for medication abortion, while thirteen states require the prescriber (usually required to be a physician) to be physically present with the patient. In the UK, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists approved a no-test protocol for medication abortion, with mifepristone available through a minimal-contact pick-up or by mail.

===Other specialist care delivery===
Telemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by primary care physicians according to a controlled study of the treatment of hepatitis C. Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.Other specialist conditions for which telemedicine has been used include perinatal mental health.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care physicians have relied on telehealth to continue to provide care in outpatient settings. The transition to virtual health has been beneficial in providing patients access to care (especially care that does not require a physical exam e.g. medication changes, minor health updates) and avoid putting patients at risk of COVID-19. This included providing services to pediatric patients during the pandemic, where issues of last minute cancelation and rescheduling were frequently related to a lack of technicality and engagement, two factors often understudied in the literature.

Telemedicine has also been beneficial in facilitating medical education to students while still allowing for adequate social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many medical schools have shifted to alternate forms of virtual curriculum and are still able to engage in meaningful telehealth encounters with patients.

Medication assisted treatment (MAT) is the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) with medications, often in combination with behavioral therapy As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic the use of telemedicine has been granted by the Drug Enforcement Administration to start or maintain people OUD on buprenorphine (trade name Suboxone) via telemedicine without the need for an initial in-person examination. On March 31, 2020, QuickMD became the first national TeleMAT service in the United States to provide Medication-assisted Treatment with Suboxone online – without the need of an in-person visit; with others announcing to follow soon.

== Major developments ==

=== In policy ===
Telehealth is a modern form of health care delivery. Telehealth breaks away from traditional health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods. Traditional health is legislated through policy to ensure the safety of medical practitioners and patients. Consequently, since telehealth is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector, many organizations have started to legislate the use of telehealth into policy. In New Zealand, the Medical Council has a statement about telehealth on their website. This illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that telehealth will have on the health system and have started to introduce telehealth legislation to practitioners along with government.

=== Transition to mainstream ===
Traditional use of telehealth services has been for specialist treatment. However, there has been a paradigm shift and telehealth is no longer considered a specialist service. This development has ensured that many access barriers are eliminated, as medical professionals and patients are able to use wireless communication technologies to deliver health care. This is evident in rural communities. Rural residents typically have to travel to longer distances to access healthcare than urban counterparts due to physician shortages and healthcare facility closures in these areas. Telehealth eliminates this barrier as health professionals are able to conduct medical consultations through the use of wireless communication technologies. However, this process is dependent on both parties having internet access and comfort level with technology, which poses barriers for many low-income and rural communities.

Telehealth allows the patient to be monitored between physician office visits which can improve patient health. Telehealth also allows patients to access expertise which is not available in their local area. This remote patient monitoring ability enables patients to stay at home longer and helps avoid unnecessary hospital time. In the long-term, this could potentially result in less burdening of the healthcare system and consumption of resources.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were large increases in the use of telemedicine for primary care visits within the United States, increasing from an average of 1.4 million visits in Q2 of 2018 and 2019 to 35 million visits in Q2 2020, according to data from IQVIA. The telehealth market is expected to grow at 40% a year in 2021. Use of telemedicine by General Practitioners in the UK rose from 20 to 30% pre-COVID to almost 80% by the beginning of 2021. More than 70% of practitioners and patients were satisfied with this. Boris Johnson was said to have &quot;piled pressure on GPs to offer more in-person consultations&quot; supporting a campaign largely orchestrated by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The Royal College of General Practitioners said that a patient &quot;right&quot; to have face-to-face appointments if they wished was &quot;undeliverable&quot;.

=== Technology advancement ===
The technological advancement of wireless communication devices is a major development in telehealth. This allows patients to self-monitor their health conditions and to not rely as much on health care professionals. Furthermore, patients are more willing to stay on their treatment plans as they are more invested and included in the process as the decision-making is shared. Technological advancement also means that health care professionals are able to use better technologies to treat patients for example in maternal care and surgery. A 2023 study published in the &quot;Journal of the American College of Surgeons&quot; showed telemedicine as making a positive impact, with expectations exceeded for those physicians and patients who had consulted online for surgeries. Technological developments in telehealth are essential to improve health care, especially the delivery of healthcare services, as resources are finite along with an ageing population that is living longer.

== Licensing ==
=== U.S. licensing and regulatory issues ===
Restrictive licensure laws in the United States require a practitioner to obtain a full license to deliver telemedicine care across state lines. Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.

If a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.

In 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.

State medical licensing boards have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country. Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.

In 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the Texas Medical Board over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.

== Major implications and impacts ==
Telehealth allows multiple, varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care, using technology. As telehealth proliferates mainstream healthcare, it challenges notions of traditional healthcare delivery. Some populations experience better quality, access and more personalized health care.

=== Health promotion ===
 Telehealth can also increase health promotion efforts. These efforts can now be more personalised to the target population and professionals can extend their help into homes or private and safe environments in which patients of individuals can practice, ask and gain health information. Health promotion using telehealth has become increasingly popular in underdeveloped countries where there are very poor physical resources available. There has been a particular push toward mHealth applications as many areas, even underdeveloped ones have mobile phone and smartphone coverage.

In a 2015 article reviewing research on the use of a mobile health application in the United Kingdom, authors describe how a home-based application helped patients manage and monitor their health and symptoms independently. The mobile health application allows people to rapidly self-report their symptoms – 95% of patients were able to report their daily symptoms in less than 100 seconds, which is less than the 5 minutes (plus commuting) taken to measure vital signs by nurses in hospitals. Online applications allow patients to remain at home to keep track of the progression of their chronic illnesses. The downside of using mHealth applications is that not everyone, especially in developing countries, has daily access to internet or electronic devices.

In developed countries, health promotion efforts using telehealth have been met with some success. The Australian hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application reported promising results in 2014. This application made in collaboration with the Australian Breastfeeding Association and a tech startup called Small World Social, helped new mothers learn how to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is beneficial to infant health and maternal health and is recommended by the World Health Organisation and health organisations all over the world. Widespread breastfeeding can prevent 820,000 infant deaths globally but the practice is often stopped prematurely or intents to do are disrupted due to lack of social support, know-how or other factors. This application gave mother&#x27;s hands-free information on breastfeeding, instructions on how to breastfeed and also had an option to call a lactation consultant over Google Hangout. When the trial ended, all participants were reported to be confident in breastfeeding.

=== Health care quality and barriers to adoption ===
A scientific review indicates that, in general, outcomes of telemedicine are or can be as good as in-person care with health care use staying similar.
Advantages of the nonexclusive adoption of already existing telemedicine technologies such as smartphone videotelephony may include reduced infection risks, increased control of disease during epidemic conditions, improved access to care, reduced stress and exposure to other pathogens&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.jaip.2020.03.008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; during illness for better recovery, reduced time and labor costs, efficient more accessible matching of patients with particular symptoms and clinicians who are experts for such, and reduced travel while disadvantages may include privacy breaches (e.g. due to software backdoors and vulnerabilities or sale of data), dependability on Internet access and, depending on various factors, increased health care use.

Theoretically, the whole health system could benefit from telehealth. There are indications telehealth consumes fewer resources and requires fewer people to operate it with shorter training periods to implement initiatives. Commenters suggested that lawmakers may fear that making telehealth widely accessible, without any other measures, would lead to patients using unnecessary health care services. Telemedicine could also be used for connected networks between health care professionals.

Telemedicine also can eliminate the possible transmission of infectious diseases or parasites between patients and medical staff. This is particularly an issue where MRSA is a concern. Additionally, some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely. For example, white coat syndrome may be avoided. Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.

However, whether or not the standard of health care quality is increasing is debatable, with some literature refuting such claims. Research has reported that clinicians find the process difficult and complex to deal with. Furthermore, there are concerns around informed consent, legality issues as well as legislative issues. A recent study also highlighted that the swift and large-scale implementation of telehealth across the United Kingdom NHS Allied Health Professional (AHP) services might increase disparities in health care access for vulnerable populations with limited digital literacy. Although health care may become affordable with the help of technology, whether or not this care will be &quot;good&quot; is the issue. Many studies indicate high satisfaction with telemedicine among patients. Among the factors associated with a good trust in telemedicine, the use of known and user-friendly video services and confidence in the data protection policies were the two variables contributing most to trust in telemedicine.

Major problems with increasing adoption include technically challenged staff, resistance to change or habits and age of patient. Focused policy could eliminate several barriers.

A review lists a number of potentially good practices and pitfalls, recommending the use of &quot;virtual handshakes&quot; for confirming identity, taking consent for conducting remote consultation over a conventional meeting, and professional standardized norms for protecting patient privacy and confidentiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.dsx.2020.06.007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the COVID-19 pandemic substantially increased, voluntarily, the adoption of telephone or video consultation and suggests that telemedicine technology &quot;is a key factor in delivery of health care in the future&quot;.

=== Economic evaluations ===
Due to its digital nature it is often assumed that telehealth saves the health system money. However, the evidence to support this is varied. When conducting economic evaluations of telehealth services, the individuals evaluating them need to be aware of potential outcomes and extraclinical benefits of the telehealth service. Economic viability relies on the funding model within the country being examined (public vs private), the consumers willingness-to-pay, and the expected remuneration by the clinicians or commercial entities providing the services (examples of research on these topics from teledermoscopy in Australia)

In a UK telehealth trial done in 2011, it was reported that the cost of health could be dramatically reduced with the use of telehealth monitoring. The usual cost of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) per cycle would be around $15,000; with telehealth it was reduced to $800 per patient. In Alaska the Federal Health Care Access Network, which connects 3,000 healthcare providers to communities, engaged in 160,000 telehealth consultations from 2001 and saved the state $8.5 million in travel costs for just Medicaid patients.

Digital interventions for mental health conditions seem to be cost-effective compared to no intervention or non-therapeutic responses such as monitoring. However, when compared to in-person therapy or medication their added value is currently uncertain.

===Beneficial enablements===
Telemedicine can be beneficial to patients in isolated communities and remote regions, who can receive care from doctors or specialists far away without the patient having to travel to visit them. Recent developments in mobile collaboration technology can allow healthcare professionals in multiple locations to share information and discuss patient issues as if they were in the same place. Remote patient monitoring through mobile technology can reduce the need for outpatient visits and enable remote prescription verification and drug administration oversight, potentially significantly reducing the overall cost of medical care. It may also be preferable for patients with limited mobility, for example, patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Telemedicine can also facilitate medical education by allowing workers to observe experts in their fields and share best practices more easily.

====During war and disasters====

Remote surgery and types of videoconferencing for sharing expertise (e.g. ad hoc assistance) have been and could be used to support doctors in Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==== Nonclinical uses ====
* Distance education including continuing medical education, grand rounds, and patient education
* administrative uses including meetings among telehealth networks, supervision, and presentations
* research on telehealth
* online information and health data management
* healthcare system integration
* asset identification, listing, and patient to asset matching, and movement
* overall healthcare system management
* patient movement and remote admission
* Physical distancing to prevent transmission of communicable diseases

== Limitations and restrictions ==
While many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into best practice. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the &quot;hands-on&quot; experience behind. Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in diagnostics, rehabilitation or mental health. To minimise safety issues, researchers have suggested not offering remote consultations for some conditions (breathing problems, new psychosis, or acute chest pain, for example), when a parent is very concerned about a child, when a condition has not resolved as expected or has worsened, or to people who might struggle to understand or be understood (such as those with limited English or learning difficulties).

The benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices. Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to privacy, safety , medical licensing and reimbursement. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context. Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.

An example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where Medicare will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient&#x27;s&#x27; home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery&#x27; state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.

More specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help – would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred?

A major legal action prompt in telehealth thus far has been issues surrounding online prescribing and whether an appropriate clinician-patient relationship can be established online to make prescribing safe, making this an area that requires particular scrutiny. It may be required that the practitioner and patient involved must meet in person at least once before online prescribing can occur, or that at least a live-video conference must occur, not just impersonal questionnaires or surveys to determine need.

Telehealth has some potential for facilitating self-management techniques in health care, but for patients to benefit from it, the appropriate contact with, and relationship, between doctor and patient must be established first. This would start with an online consultation, providing patients with techniques and tools that help them participate in healthy behaviors, and initiating a collaborative partnership between health care professionals and patient. Self-management strategies fall into a broader category called patient activation, which is defined as a &quot;patients&#x27; willingness and ability to take independent actions to manage their health.&quot; It can be achieved by increasing patients&#x27; knowledge and confidence in coping with and managing their own disease through a &quot;regular assessment of progress [...] and problem-solving support.&quot; Teaching patients about their conditions and ways to cope with chronic illnesses will allow them to be knowledgeable about their disease and willing to manage it, improving their everyday life. Without a focus on the doctor-patient relationship and on the patient&#x27;s understanding, telehealth cannot improve the quality of life of patients, despite the benefit of allowing them to do their medical check-ups from the comfort of their home.

The downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that protected health information may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission. There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a teledermatology consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation. Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor. Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields. Some medical organizations have delivered position statement on the correct use of telemedicine in their field.

Another disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient with a bacterial infection might be given an antibiotic hypodermic injection in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.

Equitability is also a concern. Many families and individuals in the United States, and other countries, do not have internet access in their homes or the proper electronic devices to access services such as a laptop or smartphone.

== Ethical issues ==
&quot;Informed consent&quot; is another issue. When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors, security breaches, or storage issues, it can impact the system&#x27;s ability to communicate. It may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.

== State of the market ==
The rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional health services in meeting patient needs; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.

Projections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care. According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth. At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.

In the UK, the Government&#x27;s Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012–2017) to reach three million people.

===United States===
In the United States, telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations.

, 95% of employers believe their organizations will continue to provide health care benefits over the next five years.

The COVID-19 pandemic drove increased usage of telehealth services in the U.S. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 154% increase in telehealth visits during the last week of March 2020, compared to the same dates in 2019.

=== Switzerland ===
From 1999 to 2018, the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) offered clinical telemedicine and online medical advice on the Internet. A team of doctors answered around 2500 anonymous inquiries annually, usually within 24 to 48 hours. The team consisted of up to six physicians who are specialists in clinical telemedicine at the USZ and have many years of experience, particularly in internal and general medicine. In the entire period, 59360 inquiries were sent and answered. The majority of the users were female and on average 38 years old. However, in the course of time, considerably more men and older people began to use the service. The diversity of medical queries covered all categories of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) and correlated with the statistical frequency of diseases in hospitals in Switzerland. Most of the inquiries concerned unclassified symptoms and signs, services related to reproduction, respiratory diseases, skin diseases, health services, diseases of the eye and nervous systems, injuries and disorders of the female genital tract. As with the Swedish online medical advice service, one-sixth of the requests related to often shameful and stigmatised diseases of the genitals, gastrointestinal tract, sexually transmitted infections, obesity and mental disorders. By providing an anonymous space where users can talk about (shameful) diseases, online telemedical services empower patients and their health literacy is enhanced by providing individualized health information. The Clinical Telemedicine and Online Counselling service of the University Hospital of Zurich is currently being revised and will be offered in a new form in the future.

== Developing countries ==
For developing countries, telemedicine and eHealth can be the only means of healthcare provision in remote areas. For example, the difficult financial situation in many African states and lack of trained health professionals has meant that the majority of the people in sub-Saharan Africa are badly disadvantaged in medical care, and in remote areas with low population density, direct healthcare provision is often very poor However, provision of telemedicine and eHealth from urban centers or from other countries is hampered by the lack of communications infrastructure, with no landline phone or broadband internet connection, little or no mobile connectivity, and often not even a reliable electricity supply.

=== Telemedicine in developing countries ===

==== Telemedicine in India ====
India has broad rural-urban population and rural India is bereaved from medical facilities, giving telemedicine a space for growth in India. Deprived education and medical professionals in rural areas is the reason behind government&#x27;s ideology to use technology to bridge this gap. Remote areas not only present a number of challenges for the service providers but also for the families who are accessing these services. Since 2018, telemedicine has expanded in India. It has undertaken a new way for doctor consultations. On 25 March 2020, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued India&#x27;s Telemedicine Practice Guidelines. The Board of Governors entasked by the Health Ministry published an amendment to the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 that gave much-needed statutory support for the practice of telemedicine in India. This sector is at an ever-growing stage with high scope of development. In April 2020, the union health ministry launched the eSanjeevani telemedicine service that operates at two levels: the doctor-to-doctor telemedicine platform, and the doctor-to-patient platform. This service crossed five million tele-consultations within a year of its launch indicating conducive environment for acceptability and growth of telemedicine in India.

==== Telemedicine in Sub-Saharan Africa ====

Sub-Saharan Africa is marked by the massive introduction of new technologies and internet access. Urban areas are facing a rapid change and development, and access to internet and health is rapidly improving. Population in remote areas however, still lack access to healthcare and modern technologies. Some people in rural regions must travel more between 2 and 6 hours to reach the closest healthcare facilities of their country. leaving room for telehealth to grow and reach isolated people in the near future.

=== Internet via satellite in rural areas ===
The Satellite African eHEalth vaLidation (SAHEL) demonstration project has shown how satellite broadband technology can be used to establish telemedicine in such areas. SAHEL was started in 2010 in Kenya and Senegal, providing self-contained, solar-powered internet terminals to rural villages for use by community nurses for collaboration with distant health centers for training, diagnosis and advice on local health issues. Those methods can have major impact on both health professionals to get and provide training from remote areas, and on the local population who can receive care without traveling long distances. Some non-profits provide internet to rural places around the world using a mobile VSAT terminal. This VSAT terminal equips remote regions allowing them to alert the world when there is a medical emergency, resulting in a rapid deployment or response from developed countries. Technologies such as the ones used by MAF allows health professionals in remote clinics to have internet access, making consultations much easier, both for patients and doctors.

In 2014, the government of Luxembourg, along with satellite operators and NGOs established SATMED, a multilayer eHealth platform to improve public health in remote areas of emerging and developing countries, using the Emergency.lu disaster relief satellite platform and the Astra 2G TV satellite. SATMED was first deployed in response to a report in 2014 by German Doctors of poor communications in Sierra Leone hampering the fight against Ebola, and SATMED equipment arrived in the Serabu clinic in Sierra Leone in December 2014. In June 2015 SATMED was deployed at Maternité Hospital in Ahozonnoude, Benin to provide remote consultation and monitoring, and is the only effective communication link between Ahozonnoude, the capital and a third hospital in Allada, since land routes are often inaccessible due to flooding during the rainy season.

== History ==
The development and history of telehealth or telemedicine (terms used interchangeably in literature) is deeply rooted in the history and development in not only technology but also society itself. Humans have long sought to relay important messages through torches, optical telegraphy, electroscopes, and wireless transmission. Early forms of telemedicine achieved with telephone and radio have been supplemented with videotelephony, advanced diagnostic methods supported by distributed client/server applications, and additionally with telemedical devices to support in-home care.

In the 21st century, with the advent of the internet, portable devices and other such digital devices are taking a transformative role in healthcare and its delivery.

=== Earliest instances ===
Although, traditional medicine relies on in-person care, the need and want for remote care has existed from the Roman and pre-Hippocratic periods in antiquity. The elderly and infirm who could not visit temples for medical care sent representatives to convey information on symptoms and bring home a diagnosis as well as treatment. In Africa, villagers would use smoke signals to warn neighboring villages of disease outbreak. The beginnings of telehealth have existed through primitive forms of communication and technology. The exact date of origin for Telehealth is unknown, but it was known to have been used during the Bubonic Plague. That version of telehealth was far different from how we know it today. During that time, they were communicating by heliograph and bonfire. Those were used to notify other groups of people about famine and war. Those are not using any form of technology yet but are starting to spread the idea of connectivity among groups of people who geographically could not be together.

=== 1800s to early 1900s ===
As technology developed and wired communication became increasingly commonplace, the ideas surrounding telehealth began emerging. The earliest telehealth encounter can be traced to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, when he used his early telephone as a means of getting help from his assistant Mr. Watson after he spilt acid on his trousers. Another instance of early telehealth, specifically telemedicine was reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1879. An anonymous writer described a case where a doctor successfully diagnosed a child over the telephone in the middle of the night. This Lancet issue, also further discussed the potential of Remote Patient Care in order to avoid unnecessary house visits, which were part of routine health care during the 1800s. Other instances of telehealth during this period came from the American Civil War, during which telegraphs were used to deliver casualty/mortality lists, medical care to soldiers, and ordering further medical supplies.

As the 1900s started, physicians quickly found a use for the telephone making it a prime communication channel to contact patients and other physicians. Over the next fifty-plus years, the telephone was a staple for medical communication. As the 1930s came around, radio communication played a key role, especially during World War I. It was specifically used to communicate with remote areas such as Alaska and Australia. They used the radio to communicate medical information. During the Vietnam War, radio communication had become more advanced and was now used to send medical teams in helicopters to help. This then brought together the Aerial Medical Service (AMS) who used telegraphs, radios, and planes to help care for people who lived in remote areas.

From the late 1800s to the early 1900s the early foundations of wireless communication were laid down. Radios provided an easier and near instantaneous form of communication. The use of radio to deliver healthcare became accepted for remote areas. The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is an example of the early adoption of radios in telehealth.

In 1925 the inventor Hugo Gernsback wrote an article for the magazine &quot;Science and Invention&quot; which included a prediction of a future where patients could be treated remotely by doctors through a device he called a &quot;teledactyl&quot;. His descriptions of the device are similar to what would later become possible with new technology.

=== Mid-1900s to 1980s ===
When the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began plans to send astronauts into space, the need for telemedicine became clear. In order to monitor their astronauts in space, telemedicine capabilities were built into the spacecraft as well as the first spacesuits. Additionally, during this period, telehealth and telemedicine were promoted in different countries especially the United States and Canada. Carrier Sekani Family Services helped pioneer telehealth in British Columbia and Canada, according to its CEO Warner Adam. After the telegraph and telephone started to successfully help physicians treat patients from remote areas, telehealth became more recognized. Technological advancements occurred when NASA sent men to space. Engineers for NASA created biomedical telemetry and telecommunications systems. NASA technology monitored vitals such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature. After the technology was created, it then became the base of telehealth medicine for the public.

Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport had a role in the early use of telemedicine, which more or less coincided with NASA&#x27;s foray into telemedicine through the use of physiologic monitors for astronauts. On October 26, 1960, a plane struck a flock of birds upon takeoff, killing many passengers and leaving a number wounded. Due to the extreme complexity of trying to get all the medical personnel out from the hospital, the practical solution became telehealth. This was expanded upon in 1967, when Kenneth Bird at Massachusetts General founded one of the first telemedicine clinics. The clinic addressed the fundamental problem of delivering occupational and emergency health services to employees and travellers at the airport, located three congested miles from the hospital. Clinicians at the hospital would provide consultation services to patients who were at the airport. Consultations were achieved through microwave audio as well as video links. The airport began seeing over a hundred patients a day at its nurse-run clinic that cared for victims of plane crashes and other accidents, taking vital signs, electrocardiograms, and video images that were sent to Massachusetts General. Over 1,000 patients are documented as having received remote treatment from doctors at MGH using the clinic&#x27;s two-way audiovisual microwave circuit. One notable story featured a woman who got off a flight in Boston and was experiencing chest pain. They performed a workup at the airport, took her to the telehealth suite where Raymond Murphy appeared on the television, and had a conversation with her. While this was happening, another doctor took notes and the nurses took vitals and any test that Murphy ordered. At this point, telehealth was becoming more mainstream and was starting to become more technologically advanced, which created a viable option for patients.

In 1964, the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute began using television links to form two-way communication with the Norfolk State Hospital which was 112 miles away for the education and consultation purposes between clinicians in the two locations.

In 1972 the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the United States approved funding for seven telemedicine projects across different states. This funding was renewed and two further projects were funded the following year.

In March 1972, the San Bernardino County Medical Society officially implemented its Tel-Med program, a system of prerecorded health-related messages, with a log of 50 tapes. The nonprofit initiative began in 1971 as a local medical project to ease the doctor shortage in the expanding San Bernardino Valley and improve the public&#x27;s access to sound medical information. It covered subjects ranging from cannabis to vaginitis. In January 1973, in response to the developing &quot;London flu&quot; epidemic hitting California and the country, a tape providing information on the disease was on air within a week after news broke of the flu spreading in the state. That spring, programs were implemented in San Diego and Indianapolis, Indiana, signaling a national acceptance of the concept. By 1979, its system offered messages on over 300 different subjects, 200 of which were available in Spanish as well as English, and serviced over 65 million people in 180 cities around the country.

=== 1980s to 1990s – maturation and renaissance ===
Telehealth projects underway before and during the 1980s would take off but fail to enter mainstream healthcare. As a result, this period of telehealth history is called the &quot;maturation&quot; stage and made way for sustainable growth. Although state funding in North America was beginning to run low, different hospitals began to launch their own telehealth initiatives. NASA provided an ATS-3 satellite to enable medical care communications of American Red Cross and Pan American Health Organization response teams, following the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. The agency then launched its SateLife/HealthNet programme to increase health service connectivity in developing countries. In 1997, NASA sponsored Yale&#x27;s Medical Informatics and Technology Applications Consortium project.

Florida first experimented with &quot;primitive&quot; telehealth in its prisons during the latter 1980s. Working with Doctors Oscar W. Boultinghouse and Michael J. Davis, from the early 1990s to 2007; Glenn G. Hammack led the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) development of a pioneering telehealth program in Texas state prisons. The three UTMB alumni would, in 2007, co-found telehealth provider NuPhysician.

The first interactive telemedicine system, operating over standard telephone lines, designed to remotely diagnose and treat patients requiring cardiac resuscitation (defibrillation) was developed and launched by an American company, MedPhone Corporation, in 1989. A year later under the leadership of its President/CEO S Eric Wachtel, MedPhone introduced a mobile cellular version, the MDPhone. Twelve hospitals in the U.S. served as receiving and treatment centers.

=== At-home virtual care ===
As the expansion of telehealth continued in 1990 Maritime Health Services (MHS) was a big part of the initiation for occupational health services. They sent a medical officer aboard the Pacific trawler that allowed for round-the-clock communication with a physician. The system that allows for this is called the Medical Consultation Network (MedNet). MedNet is a video chatting system that has live audio and visual so the physician on the other end of the call can see and hear what is happening. MetNet can be used from anywhere, not just aboard ships. Being able to provide onsite visual information allows remote patients expert emergency help and medical attention that saves money as well as lives. This has created a demand for at-home monitoring. At-home care has also become a large part of telehealth. Doctors or nurses will now give pre-op and post-op phone calls to check-in. There are also companies such as Lifeline, which give the elderly a button to press in case of an emergency. That button will automatically call for emergency help. If someone has surgery and then is sent home, telehealth allows physicians to see how the patient is progressing without them having to stay in the hospital. TeleDiagnostic Systems of San Francisco is a company that has created a device that monitors sleep patterns, so people with sleep disorders do not have to stay the night at the hospital. Another at-home device that was created was the Wanderer, which was attached to Alzheimer&#x27;s patients or people who had dementia. It was attached to them so when they wandered off it notified the staff to allow them to go after them. All these devices allowed healthcare beyond hospitals to improve, which means that more people are being helped efficiently.

=== 2000s to present ===
The advent of high-speed Internet, and the increasing adoption of ICT in traditional methods of care, spurred advances in telehealth delivery. Increased access to portable devices, like laptops and mobile phones, made telehealth more plausible; the industry then expanded into health promotion, prevention and education.

In 2002, G. Byron Brooks, a former NASA surgeon and engineer who had also helped manage the UTMB Telemedicine program, co-founded Teladoc in Dallas, Texas, which was then launched in 2005 as the first national telehealth provider.

In the 2010s, integration of smart home telehealth technologies, such as health and wellness devices, software, and integrated IoT, has accelerated the industry. Healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting the use of self-tracking and cloud-based technologies, and innovative data analytic approaches to accelerate telehealth delivery.

In 2015, Mercy Health system opened Mercy Virtual, in Chesterfield, Missouri, the world&#x27;s first medical facility dedicated solely to telemedicine.

==== COVID-19 ====

Telehealth expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming a vital means of medical communication. It allows doctors to return to humanizing the patient. It forces them to listen to what people have to say and from there make a diagnosis. Studies have demonstrated high trust in telehealth expressed by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among patients with Inflammatory bowel disease 4 out of 5 considered telemedicine as valuable tool for their management, and 85%) wanted to have a telemedicine service at their center. However, only 1 out of 4 believed that it may guarantee the same level of care as the in-person visit. Some researchers claim this creates an environment that encourages greater vulnerability among patients in self disclosure in the practice of narrative medicine. Telehealth allows for Zoom calls and video chats from across the world checking in on patients and speaking to physicians. Universities are now ensuring that medical students graduate with proficient telehealth communication skills. Experts suggest that telehealth has become a vital part of medical care; with more virtual options becoming available. The pandemic era also identified the &quot;potential to significantly improve global health equity&quot; through telehealth and other virtual care technologies.

<doc id="1177471" wikidata="Q1817507" url="?curid=1177471" title="USS Icefish">
<text>USS &quot;Icefish&quot; (SS-367), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the icefish, any member of the family &quot;Salangidae&quot;, small smeltlike fishes of China and Japan. These fish are also collectively known as whitebait.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Icefish&quot; was launched on 20 February 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Companyat Manitowoc, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. Stanley P. Mosely, wife of Captain Mosely, and commissioned on 10 June 1944.

== First patrol, September – November 1944 ==

After trials and diving tests in Lake Michigan, voyages down the Mississippi, and shakedown out of New Orleans, &quot;Icefish&quot; joined the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor 22 August. Assigned to Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood&#x27;s Pacific Fleet Submarines Force, she joined &quot;Banister&#x27;s Beagle&#x27;s&quot; (consisting of Comdr. Alan B. Banister in and ) and departed 9 September on her first war patrol which took her into Luzon Straits and the South China Sea.

October 1944 was a peak month in the war of U.S. submarines on Japanese shipping: 322,265 tons were sunk, and almost one-third of that total consisted of tankers. In October &quot;Icefish&quot; and &quot;Drum&quot; together sank 26,901 tons of enemy shipping in &quot;Convoy College&quot;, code name for the area extending across the East China Sea from Luzon Strait to Formosa and the coast of China. &quot;Icefish&quot; sank a 4,000-ton cargo vessel on 23 October and on 26 October she was credited with sinking a transport of 10,000 tons. She terminated her first war patrol at Majuro, Marshall Islands, 13 November.

== Second and third patrols, December 1944 – April 1945 ==

&quot;Icefish&quot; departed Majuro 8 December on her second war patrol in company with and . This patrol lasted 43 days with no results and she was forced to return to Pearl Harbor 20 January 1945 due to materiel difficulties.

The third war patrol began 20 February when she departed Pearl Harbor with &quot;Sawfish&quot; and . This patrol was also conducted in the East China Sea, northeast and east of Formosa. As the war was coming to an end and Japanese shipping had dwindled away largely due to the &quot;Silent Service&quot;, &quot;Icefish&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol terminated after 60 days at Apra Harbor, Guam.

== Fourth and fifth patrols, May – August 1945 ==
Her fourth war patrol was conducted in the Hainan, Hong Kong, Formosa, Siam Gulf, and Java Sea areas. This patrol lasted 46 days with no contacts.

Instead &quot;Icefish&quot; carried out another very useful function of U.S. Navy submarines during the later stages of the war. On 7 June with a PBY Catalina for air cover, she rescued six Army aviators off the coast of Formosa. &quot;Icefish&quot; arrived Fremantle 4 July for refit and sailed 29 July for her fifth war patrol. En route to station 7 August a small diesel lugger of 15 tons was intercepted. The crew consisted of two Japanese, two Eurasians, and five Chinese. One Japanese jumped overboard rather than be captured; the rest were taken on board &quot;Icefish&quot;. The lugger was sunk by gunfire.

&quot;Icefish&quot; arrived Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, 22 August 1945, thus ending her fifth and last war patrol. She departed Saipan 1 September arriving San Francisco 18 September. &quot;Icefish&quot; decommissioned at Mare Island 21 June 1946 and jointed the Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Icefish&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

== HNLMS &quot;Walrus&quot; (S802) ==

Recommissioned at Mare Island 5 June 1952, &quot;Icefish&quot; transited the Canal Zone and arrived Groton, Conn., 14 July. She decommissioned there 29 July 1952 and received a GUPPY IB conversion. Recommissioned 10 December 1952 at Groton, she remained in that area conducting various tests until 21 February 1953 when she was decommissioned and transferred to the Netherlands. She was commissioned in the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS &quot;Walrus&quot; (S802), the first of that name.

At the start of 1962 &quot;Walrus&quot; was sent to Dutch New Guinea to relieve HNLMS &quot;Zeeleeuw&quot;, which was in dire need of maintenance. For more than half a year the boat patrolled the waters near Dutch New Guinea.

Formally returned to US Navy custody, she was struck from the US Naval Register, 15 July 1971, and sold for scrapping, 15 August 1971.

<text>Michael Baumgarten (25 March 1812 – 21 July 1889) was a German Protestant theologian. Baumgarten was born at Haseldorf in Schleswig-Holstein.

==Life==
He studied at Kiel University (1832), and became professor &quot;ordinarius&quot; of theology at Rostock (1850). A liberal scholar, he became widely known in 1854 through a work, &quot;Die Nachtgesichte Sacharjas. Eine Prophetenstimme aus der Gegenwart&quot;, in which, starting from texts in the Old Testament and assuming the tone of a prophet, he discussed topics of every kind.

At a pastoral conference in 1856 he boldly defended evangelical freedom as regards the legal sanctity of Sunday. This, with other attempts to liberalize religion, brought him into conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities of Mecklenburg, and in 1858 he was deprived of his professorship.

He then travelled throughout Germany, demanding justice, telling the story of his life (&quot;&quot;Christliche Selbstgesprache&quot;, 1861), and lecturing on the life of Jesus (&quot;Die Geschichte Jesu: für das Verständniss der Gegenwart&quot;&quot;, 1859). In 1865 he helped to found the Deutsche Protestantenverein, but withdrew from it in 1877. On several occasions (1874, 1877 and 1878) he sat in the Reichstag as a member of the progressive party.

<doc id="1177480" wikidata="Q157476" url="?curid=1177480" title="Oberführer">
<text>Oberführer (short: Oberf, , ) was an early paramilitary rank of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) dating back to 1921. An &quot;Oberführer&quot; was typically an NSDAP member in charge of a group of paramilitary units in a particular geographical region. From 1921 to 1925, the phrase &quot;Oberführer&quot; was used as a title in the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), but became an actual SA rank after 1926.

&quot;Oberführer&quot; was also a rank of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS, at that time a branch of the SA), established in 1925 as &quot;Gauführer&quot;, a rank for SS officers in charge of SS personnel in the several &quot;Gaue&quot; throughout Germany; in 1928 the rank was renamed &quot;Oberführer&quot;, and used of the commanders of the three regional &quot;SS-Oberführerbereiche&quot;. In 1930, the SS was reorganized into &quot;SS-Gruppen&quot; and &quot;Brigaden&quot;, at which time &quot;Oberführer&quot; became subordinate to the higher rank of &quot;Brigadeführer&quot;. By 1932, &quot;Oberführer&quot; was an established rank of the SA, SS and NSKK.

&quot;Oberführer&quot; wore two oak leaves on the uniform collar rank patch, along with the shoulder boards and lapels of a general officer. In 1938, the status of &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; began to change with the rise of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT), which would later become the Waffen-SS. Since &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; was rated equal to a &quot;Generalmajor&quot;, and &quot;Standartenführer&quot; to an &quot;Oberst&quot;, &quot;Oberführer&quot; had no military equivalent and quickly became regarded as a senior colonel rank. This distinction continues in historical circles with most texts referring to &quot;Oberführer&quot; as a senior colonel rank while some others state it was a military equivalent to a British Army brigadier.

<doc id="1177492" wikidata="Q6828043" url="?curid=1177492" title="Michael A. Brown (Canadian politician)">
<text>Michael Arthur Brown (April 18, 1950 – September 20, 2024) was a Canadian politician in Ontario who was the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from October 2005 until October 2007. He sat in the Ontario legislature representing the northern riding of Algoma—Manitoulin for the Ontario Liberal Party from 1987 to 2011.

==Background==
Brown was born in Sarnia, Ontario on April 18, 1950. He was educated at the University of Western Ontario and Humber College, and worked as a funeral director before entering public life. He was a member of the Manitoulin Planning Board, and was president of the Manitoulin Island Country Club.

Brown died on September 20, 2024, at the age of 74.

==Politics==
Brown was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1987, defeating New Democrat Ron Boucher and Progressive Conservative Ben Wilson. The Algoma—Manitoulin riding had been held by the Progressive Conservatives for several years, and Brown&#x27;s victory was part of a larger trend towards the Liberal Party in northern Ontario.

The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the provincial election of 1990. Most ridings in northern Ontario were won by the NDP, and Brown was only able to defeat NDP candidate Lois Miller by 207 votes. He was re-elected by a larger margin in the provincial election of 1995, which was won by the Progressive Conservatives. In 1996, he endorsed Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party.

In 1996, the Tory government of Mike Harris introduced a measure to reduce the number of ridings in the province from 130 to 103. Brown&#x27;s constituency of Algoma—Manitoulin was joined with the neighbouring constituency of Algoma to create a much larger riding bearing the Algoma—Manitoulin name. He faced New Democrat Lynn Watson and Progressive Conservative Keith Currie in the election of 1999. Although Currie actually received a plurality of votes in the old Algoma riding, Brown&#x27;s dominance over the eastern corner of the constituency was such that he was able to win re-election without difficulty. The Tories again won the election; Brown served as Deputy Speaker from 2000 to 2001.

The Liberals won a majority government in the provincial election of 2003, although Brown was actually re-elected with a reduced majority over New Democrat Peter Denley. On October 23, 2003, he was named parliamentary assistant to David Ramsay, the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources. He was elected speaker of the 38th Legislative Assembly of Ontario on October 11, 2005, defeating Tory Ted Arnott in a two-way contest. The vacancy in the position was caused when Alvin Curling was named ambassador to the Dominican Republic.

Brown stood for re-election as Speaker when the 39th Legislative Assembly first convened following the 2007 provincial election but he was defeated by fellow Liberal Steve Peters on the fourth ballot. Brown&#x27;s loss was attributed to the perception that he favoured the ruling party when meting discipline to unruly politicians.

In the 2011 provincial election he lost to NDP candidate Michael Mantha by nearly 4,000 votes.

<doc id="1177499" wikidata="Q661102" url="?curid=1177499" title="Eddie Sutton">
<text>Edward Eugene Sutton (March 12, 1936 – May 23, 2020) was an American college basketball coach. A native of Bucklin, Kansas, Sutton played college basketball at Oklahoma A&amp;M (later Oklahoma State) and was a head coach at the high school, junior college, and college levels spanning six decades.

After beginning his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Oklahoma State under Henry Iba, Sutton was a successful head coach at Tulsa Central High School and the College of Southern Idaho. Sutton began coaching at the NCAA level in 1969 at Creighton University, followed by Arkansas from 1974 to 1985, Kentucky from 1985 to 1989, and Oklahoma State from 1990 to 2006. For part of the 2007–08 season, Sutton was interim head coach at San Francisco. During his college coaching career, Sutton is one of only eight NCAA Division I coaches to have had more than 800 career wins. From 1977 to 2005, Sutton&#x27;s teams appeared in all but two NCAA Tournaments. Sutton was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011 and Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Sutton was born in Bucklin, Kansas. After graduating from Bucklin High School in 1954, Sutton enrolled at what was then Oklahoma A&amp;M College, which became Oklahoma State University–Stillwater in 1957. At Oklahoma A&amp;M/State, Sutton played at guard for the Cowboys basketball team from 1955 to 1958 under head coach Henry Iba. In his junior season of 1956–57, Sutton led the Oklahoma A&amp;M Cowboys in free throw percentage at .843. As a senior in 1957–58, Sutton averaged 8.3 points and was part of a team that qualified for the NCAA tournament. Sutton graduated from Oklahoma State with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1958.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching career (1958–1969)===
Sutton began his coaching career as a graduate assistant for Iba at Oklahoma State in the 1958–59 school year before completing his master&#x27;s degree in 1959. From 1959 to 1966, Sutton was head varsity basketball coach at Tulsa Central High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he had a cumulative record of 119–51. Moving up to the junior college level, Sutton became the first head coach at the College of Southern Idaho from 1966 to 1969, with a cumulative 83–14 record.

===Creighton (1969–1974)===
From 1969 to 1974, Sutton was head coach at Creighton University, where he inherited a Bluejays program that had three consecutive losing seasons and led them to five consecutive winning seasons, including a 23–7 record and NCAA tournament appearance in the 1973–74 season.

===Arkansas (1974–1985)===
In 1974, Sutton became head coach at the University of Arkansas. Inheriting an Arkansas Razorbacks program that had losing records in three of the last four seasons and no postseason appearances since 1958, Sutton compiled a record of 260-75 from 1974 to 1985, including five Southwest Conference regular season championships, nine NCAA Tournament appearances, and a Final Four appearance in 1978.

His success led Arkansas to expand its home basketball venue, Barnhill Arena, from 5,200 seats to 9,000. Sutton also coached a trio of basketball players, all from the state of Arkansas, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;: Ron Brewer, Marvin Delph, and Sidney Moncrief.

On February 12, 1984, Arkansas had a 65–64 upset win over an undefeated, no. 1 North Carolina team that featured Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins and Brad Daugherty. The game took place at the Pine Bluff Convention Center in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and NBC Sports televised the game nationally. Arkansas finished the 1983–84 season with a 23–7 record and no. 8 AP Poll ranking. Number 2 seed Arkansas lost to number 7 seed Virginia 53–51 in overtime in the NCAA tournament. In Sutton&#x27;s final season as head coach in 1984–85, Arkansas went 22–13 and qualified for the second round of the NCAA tournament.

===Kentucky (1985–1989)===
On April 2, 1985, the University of Kentucky hired Sutton as head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats to replace Joe B. Hall. In a prepared statement, Hall said: &quot;...with Eddie, I see nothing but great days ahead.&quot;

He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title (which was later vacated by the SEC) and were ranked as the No. 6 college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI before being upset as the No. 2 seed in the Southeast Regional by Villanova in the 1988 NCAA tournament.

Sutton&#x27;s tenure at Kentucky ended at the close of the 1988–89 season after a scandal and a losing record tarnished the school&#x27;s basketball program. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season lacking significant talent in their lineup. The previous season&#x27;s offensive and defensive stars Ed Davender, Rob Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential star recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year. As it turned out, Manuel didn&#x27;t play a single game as the investigation dragged through the entire season, essentially placing the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team&#x27;s first losing full-season record since 1927.

The scandal broke when it was alleged that Emery Worldwide employees discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey supposedly sent to Mills&#x27; father. It was later shown that Casey was uninvolved in the Emery envelope incident.

The NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies. The NCAA deemed the violations so egregious that it seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the &quot;death penalty&quot;, which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. Kentucky was eligible for this severe penalty because it was already on probation for failing to cooperate with an investigation into an extensive scheme of payments to recruits.

By then, Sutton was already gone. In March, school president David Roselle told Sutton that he had lined up enough support on UK&#x27;s athletics board to fire him unless he resigned. Rather than face all-but-certain termination, Sutton resigned. Athletic director Cliff Hagan resigned as well. The Wildcats were slapped with three years&#x27; probation, a two-year ban from postseason play and a ban from live television in 1989–90. Manuel was also banned from ever playing again for any NCAA member school.

===Oklahoma State (1990–2006)===
After a year away from the game, Sutton returned to his alma mater, Oklahoma State, on April 11, 1990. He inherited a program that had fallen on hard times. At the time of his hire, since joining (or rejoining, depending on the source) the Big Eight Conference in 1957, Oklahoma State appeared in only three NCAA Tournaments. Previous Oklahoma State head coach Leonard Hamilton had also resigned to take the job at the University of Miami.

In his first season at Oklahoma State, Sutton led the Cowboys to a 24–8 record, Big Eight regular season title, and Sweet 16 appearance in the 1991 NCAA tournament. In the 1991–92 season, Oklahoma State improved to 28–8 and made it to a second straight Sweet 16, followed by two more NCAA Tournament appearances in 1993 and 1994.

In Sutton&#x27;s fifth season, the 1994–95 Oklahoma State team, led by Bryant Reeves (also known as &quot;Big Country&quot;) and Randy Rutherford, won the Big Eight tournament and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1951. Following the season, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; sports columnist Berry Tramel observed: &quot;Sutton is pleased that pride has returned to the court made famous by Iba.&quot; Reeves went on to be selected sixth overall in the 1995 NBA draft.

Sutton continued to coach Oklahoma State following the school&#x27;s move from the Big Eight to Big 12 Conference in 1996.

Oklahoma State&#x27;s best season under Sutton was in 2003–04. With the roster including a significant number of transfers, Oklahoma State had a 31–4 overall record that tied the school record for overall wins in addition to gaining Big 12 regular season and tournament titles and the school&#x27;s second Final Four appearance under Sutton. The 2003–04 team included junior college transfer Tony Allen, who would go on to be the 25th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft and a six-time All-Defensive honoree in the NBA.

On January 15, 2005, the court at Oklahoma State&#x27;s home arena, Gallagher-Iba Arena, was officially renamed Eddie Sutton Court.

On February 10, 2006, Sutton was involved in a car accident in Stillwater. He was cited for driving under the influence. Witnesses said that Sutton fell and hit his head at the Gallagher-Iba Arena parking lot, and &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; reported that campus police officers and athletic department physicians helped Sutton into his university-provided Dodge Durango. After declining a police officer&#x27;s offer for a ride or ambulance, Sutton hit another SUV from behind at 60 mph, resulting in minor injuries for the other driver. Following the accident, Sutton&#x27;s blood alcohol level was measured at .22, nearly three times the legal limit of .08.

Sutton announced on February 14 that he would take a medical leave of absence from the basketball team, citing his health problems and the accident as reasons. Assistant coach and son Sean Sutton served as acting head coach for the remainder of the season. The following day, in a prepared statement delivered over the phone at a press conference, Sutton admitted he had taken prescription medication due to back pain and &quot;bought a bottle&quot; of alcohol on the night of the accident. Sutton went on to say: &quot;I have a problem with alcohol. That said, I make no excuses for what has happened. I recognize it and I will be seeking treatment for it. I know I have let many people down.&quot;

Sutton eventually resigned as head coach May 19, 2006, succeeded by Sean Sutton. In 16 seasons, Sutton had a 368–151 record at Oklahoma State with 13 NCAA Tournament appearances, two regular season conference titles (Big Eight in 1991, Big 12 in 2004), and three conference tournament titles (Big Eight in 1995, Big 12 in 2004 and 2005).

===San Francisco (2007–2008)===
On December 26, 2007, Sutton came out of retirement to replace Jessie Evans as head coach at the University of San Francisco on an interim basis.

On February 2, 2008, Sutton became the fifth NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball coach to reach 800 career wins after San Francisco rallied from a 19-point second half deficit to defeat Pepperdine 85–82 in an away game. San Francisco concluded the season with an overall 10–21 record, including 6–13 under Sutton. Following the season, San Francisco hired Rex Walters as head coach.
