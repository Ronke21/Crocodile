<text>Alessandro Costacurta (born 24 April 1966) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Throughout his club career, Costacurta spent over twenty years with AC Milan between 1986 and 2007, as well as a brief season-long spell on loan at Monza. He is best known for his role alongside Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, and Mauro Tassotti, forming one of the greatest defences in Serie A and European football during the late 1980s and 1990s, under the success of managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello. He mainly operated as a central defender, and was a leading exponent of the position, receiving International acclaim, winning 7 Serie A titles and 5 Champions League/European Cup trophies throughout his career, along with many other trophies. Costacurta retired from professional football at the age of 41, on 19 May 2007. In his final match for Milan, he scored a goal from a penalty in a 3–2 defeat against Udinese, becoming the oldest goalscorer in Serie A a record that was broken by Zlatan Ibrahimović in 2023 who also scored from the spot against Udinese aged 41 five months and 15 days.

Along with his Milan teammates, Costacurta was also an important member of the Italy national side during the 1990s. He made 59 appearances for Italy, scoring 2 goals, and he participated in two World Cups (in 1994 and 1998), as well as a European Championship in 1996. With Italy, he managed to reach the 1994 World Cup Final, which was lost against Brazil on penalties.

==Club career==
===Early AC Milan career and Monza loan===
Alessandro Costacurta was affectionally known to his fans as &quot;Billy&quot;, due to his thin physique in his youth, and his notable skill at basketball (as the local basketball team of Milan, Olimpia Milano, was referred to as &quot;Billy&quot; during the late 1970s, the team&#x27;s main shirt sponsor). Originally an AC Milan youth side product, during his professional career Costacurta would go on to play for the senior club for over 20 seasons, after a brief spell on loan at Monza in Serie C1 during the 1986–87 season. Costacurta was already a young member of the senior squad during the 1985–86 season, but failed to make a single appearance. Before being sent to Monza on loan, Costacurta would make his Milan debut in the Coppa Italia during the 1986–87 season, but would not make his Serie A debut with Milan until the following year, under Arrigo Sacchi. Costacurta made his first Serie A appearance on 25 October 1987 against Hellas Verona on the sixth matchday of the season. Milan would go on to win the match 1–0, as well as the Serie A title, but Costacurta received limited playing opportunities that season, due to the presence of the more experienced Filippo Galli in his position. Overall, Costacurta managed 7 appearances in Serie A, and one appearance in the Coppa Italia that season.

===Success under Sacchi and Capello===

The 1988–89 season would see Costacurta gain more playing opportunities and appear more frequently for the club, as he would feature in Milan&#x27;s 3–1 win over Sampdoria in the 1988 Supercoppa Italiana. He would make 26 appearances in Serie A that season, and would also win his first European Cup title after Milan defeated Steaua București 4–0 at the Camp Nou, Barcelona. Costacurta played the first 74 minutes of the final before being substituted by Filippo Galli.

During the 1989–90 Season, Costacurta won his second consecutive European Cup with Milan, defeating Benfica 1–0 in the final in Vienna, and starting the play which led to Frank Rijkaard&#x27;s match-winning goal. He also featured in Milan&#x27;s Intercontinental Cup win in Tokyo over Atlético Nacional, and in the European Supercup victory over Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona. Costacurta also scored his first goal in Serie A during that season, in a 3–1 away defeat to Milanese rivals Internazionale in the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot;. Milan would also reach the Coppa Italia final that season. In Sacchi&#x27;s final season at the club, Costacurta would become a starting centreback alongside Franco Baresi, as well as full-backs Mauro Tassotti and Paolo Maldini, in Sacchi&#x27;s four-man defensive line, which is regarded as one of the greatest defences of all-time. Costacurta would make 25 appearances in Serie A that season, and he would also win his second consecutive Intercontinental Cup and European Super Cup trophies.

Under Capello&#x27;s Milan, Costacurta continued to be a permanent member of the starting line-up, and he won four Serie A titles (including three consecutive titles in 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94, as well as another title in 1995–96), a Champions League title in 1994, an UEFA Super Cup in 1994, as well as three consecutive Italian Supercups in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Milan also managed to reach three consecutive Champions League finals between 1992–93 and 1994–95. However, Costacurta missed the 1994 Champions League final win over Barcelona on 18 May because of a suspension, having been sent-off in the semi-final match against Monaco. Costacurta also helped Milan to win the 1991–92 Serie A title undefeated, as Milan went on an Italian record of 58 matches unbeaten. He also played a key role in Milan&#x27;s defensive line in the 1993–94 title, by only conceding 15 goals all season, as Milan finished the season with the best defence in Italy.

===Post-1996 crisis and Zaccheroni era===
Following Capello&#x27;s departure after the 1995–96 title win, as well as the aging and retirement of certain key players, Milan faced dark times in their history. Milan were defeated in the 1996 Italian Supercup final by 1995–96 Coppa Italia winners Fiorentina, and the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons were negative, as Milan failed to qualify for Europe on both occasions. These fruitless seasons saw Milan undergo several managerial changes, including Tabárez, and the unsuccessful returns of Sacchi and Capello. However, Costacurta, through his joint leadership in defense alongside Maldini, would help Milan reach the 1998 Coppa Italia final, losing out to Lazio despite 2–0 lead on aggreagate. With the arrival of Alberto Zaccheroni during the 1998–99 season, Costacurta continued to be a key member of the starting line-up, and featured in Zaccheroni&#x27;s new three-man defense alongside Maldini and Luigi Sala; during this time he usually played in the middle of the back three. Costacurta was also named Milan&#x27;s vice-captain that season, behind Maldini, following the retirement of Baresi and Tassotti. At the end of the season, Milan managed to capture their 16th &quot;Scudetto&quot; win, and Costacurta&#x27;s sixth in total, finishing ahead of Lazio by a single point. However, the next two seasons would see Milan undergo yet another trophy drought. Milan would lose the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana to Parma, and would finish in third place in 1999–2000, and in a disappointing sixth place, outside of the Champions League spots, in 2000–01. Milan also suffered early eliminations in the first and second round of Champions League during those two seasons, and Zaccheroni would be sacked midway through the 2000–01 season, and replaced with Cesare Maldini as a temporary caretaker.

===Later career and success under Ancelotti===

For the 2001–02 season, Fatih Terim was appointed as Milan&#x27;s coach, but after the first eight matches, and negative results, Costacurta&#x27;s former Milan teammate Carlo Ancelotti was appointed manager. Ancelotti guided Milan to a fourth-place finish in Serie A, which allowed them to clinch the final UEFA Champions League qualifying spot, and ultimately qualify for the next season&#x27;s Champions League. Ancelotti also helped Milan to their best ever UEFA Cup finish that season, reaching the semi-finals. Ancelotti&#x27;s arrival and several new signings would bring about a new era of European and Italian dominance for Milan, and Costacurta would form part of another excellent defence, which included players such as Maldini, Alessandro Nesta, Jaap Stam and Cafu.

At the end of the season, in 2002, Costacurta&#x27;s contract was expiring – he therefore decided to leave the club at age 36 following their American exhibition tour in the summer to pursue a Master&#x27;s in Economics in the United States. However, Milan lacked defenders in their squad due to injuries, and Adriano Galliani recalled Costacurta to renew his contract the night before the second leg of their crucial UEFA Champions League playoff match against Czech side Slovan Liberec. Milan qualified with difficulty, winning 1–0 in Milan, but being defeated 2–1 in the away match, progressing only on away goals. Milan finished third in Serie A that season, and Costacurta won his first ever Coppa Italia with the club, overcoming Roma in the final. Under Ancelotti, Costacurta would be employed at both centre-back and right-back during this season. Despite difficulties encountered in qualifying, Milan reached the Champions League final that season, in the first ever all-Italian final against Serie A rivals Juventus. On 28 May 2003, Milan captured the Champions League after defeating Juventus 3–2 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time. Costacurta started the match at right back, and was substituted in the 65th minute, coming off for Roque Júnior. This was Costacurta&#x27;s fourth career Champions League title.

In the following season, Milan were defeated in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana by Juventus on penalties. Milan defeated Porto 1–0 in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup final, but lost on penalties to Boca Juniors in the 2003 Intercontinental Cup final. Costacurta missed the decisive penalty in the shootout. However, Milan won the 2003–04 Serie A title with a record 82 points, with Costacurta, then aged 37, winning his seventh league title with Milan (only Virginio Rosetta, Giuseppe Furino, Giovanni Ferrari and Gianluigi Buffon have more Serie A titles, with eight titles each). In 2004, Costacurta was elected 50th in the UEFA Golden Jubilee online poll, which celebrated the best European footballers from the past 50 years.

Costacurta began the 2004–05 Serie A season winning his fifth Supercoppa Italiana after Milan defeated Lazio. Milan would finish the season in second place in a closely fought title race against Juventus. Milan would also suffer a huge disappointment in the UEFA Champions League. Milan reached the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul as heavy favourites over Liverpool. At half-time, Milan were leading 3–0, but Liverpool made a second half comeback, scoring three goals to tie the match and send it into extra time. Liverpool ended up winning the title in the resulting penalty shootout in what became known as &quot;The Miracle of Istanbul&quot;.

Milan reached the semi-finals of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, only to be eliminated disappointingly by eventual champions Barcelona. Milan also finished second in Serie A behind Juventus that season, for the second consecutive season. However, both teams were found to be guilty of being involved in the 2006 Italian match-fixing scandal, and received point deductions. Juventus were relegated to Serie B, and Milan ended up finishing in third place, while the &quot;Scudetto&quot; was assigned to Internazionale. Costacurta was set to retire from Milan at the end of the 2005–06 season, but later signed a one-year extension at age 40. On 21 November 2006, he became the oldest footballer ever to play in the Champions League, in Milan&#x27;s 1–0 loss to AEK Athens, at 40 years and 211 days, topping the previous record held by Belgian goalkeeper Dany Verlinden at 40 years and 116 days. Costacurta&#x27;s record was later broken by Marco Ballotta, who on 11 December 2007, played a match at age 43 years and 253 days for Lazio against Real Madrid.

Costacurta began his final professional season with the club at age 40. During the season, he won his fifth UEFA Champions League title with Milan. On 7 May 2007, at age 41, he announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2006–07 season. He remained with the club as a second assistant to manager Carlo Ancelotti for a short time afterwards. He made his final home start in Milan&#x27;s 3–2 loss to Udinese on 19 May 2007, converting a penalty that marked his first Serie A goal since the 1991–92 season (15 years after his left-footed volley against Roma on 3 November 1991), and left the pitch near the end of the match to a standing ovation. With this goal, he became the oldest goalscorer in Serie A, at the age of 41 years and 25 days, surpassing the previous record held by Silvio Piola, who in Novara–Milan, on 7 February 1954, scored a goal at 40 years, six months and nine days. Costacurta also became the oldest outfield player to play in a Serie A match. The only players to have played in a match at a more senior age were goalkeepers Marco Ballotta (44 years and 38 days), Alberto Fontana (41 years and 297 days), Francesco Antonioli (41 years and 243 days) and Dino Zoff (41 years and 76 days). After the match, Costacurta&#x27;s Milan teammates entered the pitch wearing a replica of his jersey as a tribute.

With Milan, Costacurta won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; seven times and the European Cup/UEFA Champions League five times, in 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003 and 2007, although he did not feature in the squad for the 1994 and 2007 finals. Costacurta also won a Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana, four UEFA Supercups and two Intercontinental Cups with Milan. He also managed to reach three more UEFA Champions League finals, wherein Milan lost to Marseille in 1992–93, Ajax in 1994–95 and Liverpool in the 2004–05, with a total of eight finals reached and five won. He also reached two more consecutive Intercontinental Cup finals, where Milan were defeated 3–2 by São Paulo in 1993 and 2–0 by Vélez Sársfield (where Costacurta was sent off in the 85th minute) in 1994, as well as losing out on the 1993 UEFA Super Cup to Parma under Fabio Capello, and the 2003 Intercontinental Cup to Boca Juniors under Carlo Ancelotti. Costacurta made 662 appearances for Milan throughout his career (458 in Serie A, 78 in the Coppa Italia, 108 in European Competitions, 5 appearances in the Intercontinental Cup final, 6 in the Italian Super Cup final, and 7 in the UEFA Super Cup final). He only scored three goals in Serie A, with his first coming in a 3–1 defeat in the Milan–Inter derby on 13 March 1990. The second came in a 4–1 over Roma at the San Siro, on 3 November, where he scored the fourth goal of the match, and his final goal was scored in a 3–2 defeat to Udinese on the final match of his career. Costacurta is the third highest appearances holder for Milan in official matches, with 662 caps; only Franco Baresi (719) and Paolo Maldini (902) have managed more appearances.

==International career==
Between 1986 and 1990, Costacurta made eight appearances with the Italian under-21 side, participating in two European Championships in 1988, where Italy reached the quarter-finals, and in 1990, where Italy reached the semi-finals.

A mainstay in the Italy national team throughout the 1990s, Costacurta played for his country in three major tournaments: the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, as well as Euro 1996. He received his first senior call-up under Azeglio Vicini on 22 December 1990, but he made his debut for the senior team on 13 November 1991, at age 25, in a 1–1 draw against Norway in Genoa. He later became a regular first-team member under his former Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi, who replaced Vicini in 1991 after Italy failed to qualify for Euro 1992 in Sweden. Costacurta scored his first goal for Italy on 4 June 1992 from a penalty in a 2–0 against the Republic of Ireland during Italy&#x27;s U.S. Cup run, where they finished in second place to the host nation in the friendly tournament.

Costacurta was a starting member in Italy&#x27;s defensive line at the 1994 World Cup. He helped Italy reach the final, putting in strong defensive performances alongside Milan teammate Paolo Maldini, in particular following fellow Milan centre-back Franco Baresi&#x27;s injury, and fellow Milan right-back Mauro Tassotti&#x27;s suspension. He notably helped a ten-man Italy to keep a clean sheet in their second group match against Norway. However, after missing out on the 1994 Champions League final through suspension, he also missed the 1994 World Cup final loss on penalties to Brazil, again due to suspension, after receiving a yellow card in the semi-final match against Bulgaria. Costacurta started in Euro 1996 for Italy, as they were eliminated in the first round, in a group with the two eventual finalists, the Czech Republic and Germany.

Costacurta was once again a key member of Italy&#x27;s defence in the 1998 World Cup under manager Cesare Maldini, starting in all five of Italy&#x27;s matches and helping the team to keep three clean sheets. Italy were eliminated in the quarter-final to hosts and eventual champions France on penalties once again after a 0–0 draw following extra time, even though Costacurta converted Italy’s third penalty. Despite Dino Zoff&#x27;s intention to use him in the Italy squad for the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, Costacurta retired from international duty in 1998, with 59 caps and two goals, after Italy&#x27;s elimination from the World Cup.

==Style of play==
Costacurta is regarded by many pundits, managers and players as one of the greatest defenders in history; he formed some of the most formidable defensive units of all time during his extensive career at Milan, alongside Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, and Mauro Tassotti in particular, but also other top defenders such as Filippo Galli, Christian Panucci, Alessandro Nesta, Cafu and Jaap Stam. Costacurta was a tactically versatile defender who excelled anywhere along the backline, which allowed him to have a long and highly successful career, both at club level and with the national side, winning many trophies. Although he was primarily played as a man–marking centre-back (or &quot;stopper,&quot; in Italian) alongside Baresi throughout his career, he also occasionally played as a sweeper, as a full-back on either flank, and even as a defensive midfielder.

Costacurta was a complete, hard-working and experienced defender who was also gifted with good distribution and crossing ability, as well as a solid technique and first touch, which he developed further as his career progressed, despite not initially being the most naturally skilful player on the ball; this enabled him to be comfortable in possession, carry the ball forward into midfield, and start attacking plays from the back-line. He was a tenacious yet disciplined defender with fast reactions who was known in particular for his exceptional tactical intelligence as well as his timing and strong, precise tackling ability. He was also quick-thinking, mobile, effective in the air, and had an outstanding ability to read the game and anticipate plays, despite his lack of notable pace, physical strength or athletic attributes, due to his slender build. He was an extremely precise and attentive footballer who excelled both at man marking as well as in a zonal marking system, due to his excellent positional and organisational sense, communication, awareness and his ability to play the offside trap effectively. Despite being a defender, he was an accurate penalty taker who often took penalties for his team in shoot-outs. He also stood out for his class, leadership and professionalism on the pitch, as well as his longevity throughout his career. In July 2014, compatriot and 2006 Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Fabio Cannavaro described Costacurta as the best defender with whom he had ever played. In 2015, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; included him at number two in their list of &quot;The top 20 most under-rated footballers of all time.&quot;

==Post-playing and managerial career==
After his retirement, in 2007–08 Costacurta was a member of Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s coaching staff at Milan as a technical assistant, while earning his own coaching badges. At the end of the season, he successfully earned his badges and various Italian media reported that he was pursuing a managerial role of his own. However, he refused a position at Pisa offered by new club owner Luca Pomponi immediately after the completion of his takeover of the club, citing his need to remain at Milan in order to stay at home and take care of his son while his wife was on tour with the theater.

On 27 October 2008, Costacurta was unveiled as new coach of Serie B promotion candidates Mantova, then 13th in the table, following the dismissal of previous boss Giuseppe Brucato. However, his time at Mantova proved to be unsuccessful, as he failed to improve Mantova&#x27;s results and ultimately leading him to tend his resignation from the coaching post following a 1–0 loss to Vicenza that left his club only four points above the relegation zone.

In 2010 he was hired by Sky Italia as a football pundit, becoming one of the main sports personalities from the TV channel and being featured in many of the channel&#x27;s shows.

==Personal life==
Costacurta is married to former Miss Italia Martina Colombari, and has one son, Achille.

Costacurta is known for his vocal criticism of homophobia and discrimination against women. In a 2012 interview with Italian newspaper &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;, he stated that footballers should be allowed to be open about their sexuality.

On 26 July 2021, his mother, Margherita Beccegato, died in a car accident at the age of 87.

<doc id="1151139" wikidata="Q3885311" url="?curid=1151139" title="South Carolina Lowcountry">
<text>The Lowcountry (sometimes Low Country or just low country) is a geographic and cultural region along South Carolina&#x27;s coast, including the Sea Islands. The region includes significant salt marshes and other coastal waterways, making it an important source of biodiversity in South Carolina.

Once known for its slave-based agricultural wealth in rice and indigo, crops that flourished in the hot subtropical climate, the Lowcountry today is known for its historic cities and communities, natural environment, cultural heritage, and tourism industry. Demographically, the Lowcountry is still heavily dominated by African American communities, such as the Gullah/Geechee people.

As of the 2020 census, the population of the Lowcountry was 1,167,139.
==Geography==

The term &quot;Low Country&quot; originally referred to all of the states below the Fall Line, or the Sandhills, which run the width of the states from Aiken County to Chesterfield County. The Sandhills, or Carolina Sandhills, is a 15–60 km wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, along the inland margin of this province. The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States had colder air temperatures and stronger winds. The area above the Sandhills is known as &quot;Upstate&quot; or &quot;Upcountry&quot;. These areas are different in geology, geography, and culture.

There are several variations in the geographic extent of the &quot;Lowcountry&quot; area. The most commonly accepted definition includes Charleston, Dorchester, Beaufort, Georgetown, Colleton, Hampton, Berkeley, Jasper, and Williamsburg Counties, often described as the area encompassing the basins of Cooper River, Santee River, ACE (Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto), Winyah Bay, and Savannah River. Some include Marion and Horry Counties. Dillon County is included in the Lowcountry by the largest group of healthcare executives in the state. Allendale is also occasionally included in the region.

Four counties are covered by the Lowcountry Council of Governments, a regional governmental entity charged with regional and transportation planning, and are the ones included in the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism&#x27;s &quot;Lowcountry and Resort Islands&quot; area. The area includes the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. 

Technically, the Lowcountry is synonymous with the areas with a large population of Gullah Geechee peoples of the region. Gullah Geechee people have traditionally resided in the coastal areas and the sea islands of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida—from Pender County, North Carolina, to St. Johns County, Florida.

Coastal South Carolina’s half a million acres of salt marsh, which typifies the Lowcountry in particular, is underlain by &quot;plough mud&quot; or &quot;pluff mud&quot;, named for the traditional spelling of &quot;plow&quot; but now often pronounced to rhyme with &quot;rough&quot;. Once used to fertilize fields of cotton, the mud is pervaded by decaying organic matter and bacteria that feed on it, giving it a notoriously sulfurous stench.

==Lowcountry gentry==

Historically the region was dominated by the Lowcountry gentry, a planter aristocracy that dominated most economic activities in the region through extensive plantations. These gentry quickly imported most of the early slaves to South Carolina, and made a concerted effort to outlaw further imports, especially into the hinterland, in an effort to preserve their economic dominance.

Timothy Ford, a lawyer born in Trenton, New Jersey, moved to the Lowcountry in 1760 and criticized the gentry as having an &quot;effeminate spirit of luxury and dissipation&quot; and seemingly only cared about amusement, gambling, accumulation of wealth, and vanity.

At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, a subgroup of Lowcountry gentry emerged to prominence, the &quot;Rice Pharaohs&quot; who would create generational wealth with them and their descendants dominating South Carolinian politics in an effort to preserve slavery at all costs. The center of the rice industry was based around the confluence of the Waccamaw, the Great Peedee and Black Rivers due to the abundance of sediment deposits, a region that was compared to the Nile river in Egypt. Due to the harsh climate and labor intensive work required to harvest rice, planters at the time deemed it &quot;impossible&quot; to cultivate the region. The vast majority of slaves to South Carolina where imported for the rice plantations, and as such the rice pharaohs also become dominate players in the slave trade. Due to this Charleston rapidly grew to facilitate rice exports and slave imports.

The rice pharaohs quickly surpassed and replaced other gentry, such as those who grew sugar, due to the sugar industry&#x27;s reliance on British trade with the Caribbean, making most of them loyalists during the war. By 1787 the Lowcountry gentry argued in favor of abolishing the import of any new slaves to the United States, as their own plantations where self sufficient, and their slaves reproducing. However, with Eli Whitney&#x27;s invention of the cotton gin, South Carolina permitted the import of slaves from 1803 to 1808, almost exclusively to new inland cotton plantations, which saw the rise of the &quot;Piedmont gentry&quot; who began to erode the economic dominance of the rice pharaohs and Lowcounty gentry as a whole and advocated for further expansions to slavery. In order to compete with inland plantations, the Lowcountry gentry began buying land from Alabama to Texas and advocating for the reopening of the slave trade.

By the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 the Lowcountry gentry sided with the Piedmont gentry in the cause for secession. Following the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat in the American Civil War, many of the Lowcountry estates had been destroyed by the Union army, with the slaves on the remaining plantations being emancipated, which finally broke the power of the Lowcountry gentry. Soon timber and phosphate mining became the primary economic power in the Lowcountry, as the remaining rice plantations struggled to compete with those in Texas. The deathblow to the rice plantations would be a series of hurricanes from 1893 to 1911 which destroyed most of the remaining estates, with their owners being unable to afford to rebuild. Their lands where mostly bought by Northerners to turn into hunting preserves, with only 70,000 acres of rice impoundments existing by 1999.

== Tourism ==
The tourism industry has been a vibrant part of the region&#x27;s economy since the beginning of the 20th century. The tourism commission advertises both nature-based tourism and historic sites. The pressure of the tourism industry on the coast both encroaches on marshland and places pressure on African American communities.

The industry tends to emphasize the Gullah Geechee cultural tradition as part of the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor. Important to this cultural tradition are traditional sweetgrass baskets. But, harvesting natural sweetgrass is under pressure from both development and overharvesting. Mary Jackson was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for her work making sweetgrass baskets.

<doc id="1151140" wikidata="Q1393671" url="?curid=1151140" title="Fake (manga)">
<text>is a seven-volume BL manga by Sanami Matoh. The story focuses in a romance between Randy &quot;Ryo&quot; Maclean and Dee Laytner, two New York City detectives from the fictitious 27th precinct. An anime version of the fifth act (or chapter) from the second manga is also available, in the form of an OVA. &quot;Fake&quot; was first published as seven volumes by Biblos, but after the company went bankrupt in 2006, &quot;Fake&quot; was republished by Mediation as five volumes, with one newly drawn extra story featured at the back of each. &quot;Fake&quot;&#x27;s English translation is published by Tokyopop in the United States of America, and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. All seven volumes are available in English. The one-off sequel &quot;Like, like love&quot; is only available in Japan as a part of an art book by Matoh.

On May 12, 2007, the manga &quot;Fake &quot;Second Season&quot;&quot;, a sequel, premiered in a new Japanese magazine called &quot;Hug&quot;, also published by Mediation. There is currently no news on North American licensing.

==Summary==
Randy &quot;Ryo&quot; Maclean, a half-Japanese cop, is new to the 27th Precinct in New York, and he is partnered with Dee Laytner, an American with an overconfident attitude. Dee has a great amount of romantic interest in Ryo, but Ryo isn&#x27;t sure about his own feelings for his partner or even what to think of another man or woman hitting on him. It&#x27;s one misadventure and awkward moment to the next as the two of them try to sort out their relationship and feelings, while still keeping up with their jobs and their normal lives.

Other noteworthy characters are Bikky and Carol, two kids who have lost their families and have been taken in by Ryo, and subsequently by Dee. A few of the acts focus on the very sweet young love that develops between those two. JJ and Drake are other detectives from the 27th, and JJ, completely obsessed with Dee, becomes quite jealous of Ryo, and that of course makes for some interesting moments throughout the story, although JJ moves his attentions to Drake towards the end of the series. Berkeley Rose has a similar fancy for Ryo. He isn&#x27;t shy about it either, going so far as to steal a kiss whenever possible, much to the irritation of both Dee and Ryo.

==Characters==
: 
: A dark-haired young American cop who dislikes trouble-makers, which is ironic, since he seems to be one himself. His personality can switch from boisterous and inappropriate to serious and calm instantly. Though moody at times, he cares very much for the people around him. He is in love with Ryo, but has dated women in the past; in Dee&#x27;s own words, he has several types of women he likes, but Ryo is the only and perfect man for him to love (though he admits to being bisexual from the start which seems to have occurred sometime after his teen years and appears to have had sexual experiences with other men prior to meeting Ryo).
:Dee may seem to be rude and intrusive, but he has a strict sense of honor that will not allow him to take advantage of anybody; however his parameters can often be well outside the norm. He claims to hate children but understands Bikky&#x27;s motives well, often acting the part of the wicked uncle when Ryo tries to impose a bit of discipline upon the unruly boy. Dee is fiercely protective of both Carol and Bikky, and is well liked by the children who now live at the orphanage where he and his childhood friend Tommy grew up.
:The surname &quot;Laytner&quot; is made up; the name of the cop who found him in an alleyway was Jess Latener. Seeing him as a father figure even after he was revealed to be less than perfect, Dee was proud to take a similar name to the strict Jess. Dee is searching for stability in his life. Dee claims at first to have been trying to get Ryo to lighten up by kissing him but falls in love with him.
:
:Also known as Ryō, is a half-Japanese officer and Dee&#x27;s partner. A shy and sensitive man, he lost both parents at the age of eighteen. While he seems to be a little &quot;out of it&quot;, he is very mature and his attention comes into play when it counts. He takes in the young Bikky to live with him early on in the story, and of course, he needs every ounce of smarts to keep the boy out of trouble. Often, he tries to deflect Dee&#x27;s advances, but to little effect.
:Ryo is unsure of what he really wants, but seems to care a lot about his partner nonetheless. He is uncomfortable with being constantly called by his Japanese name since this implies a certain degree of intimacy, and he is a very private man. However as Dee imposes this name upon him others begin to adopt it, and gradually he is forced to be more open. Highly suggestible, Ryo ponders frequently over the advice given to him by others and at times he questions his own view of himself, which tends to make him depressed.
:Ryo loves children and tries to surround himself with warmth and affection. He is very compassionate, cares little for money but saves conscientiously and likes flowers. He has a strong idea of how he wants things to be, but Dee tends to spoil these plans, with his casual attitude to tidiness and his confusing behavior. While Ryo comes across to those who don&#x27;t know him as friendly and shy, at times the control he has over his actions is broken by Bikky or Dee, exposing a more violent side. This appears to upset him on occasion, and may be part of the reason that Dee makes him uneasy. At first Ryo is confused by Dee&#x27;s advances and also why he lets him especially since he considers himself straight. He gradually warms to him, appearing jealous when other people kiss Dee. He eventually accepts who he is and how he feels about Dee.
:
:Bikky is bi-racial, African American young boy with golden hair who is around 10 at the start of the series. Bikky generally behaves in front of Ryo, and treats him like a father. Bikky swiftly makes it known that he dislikes Dee, especially for the fact that Dee has his eye on Ryo. Fearing that Dee may hurt Ryo since he used to be an active womanizer, and being not used to homosexuality in his surroundings, Bikky swears to protect Ryo from Dee&#x27;s advances, engaging in any tactics he can to keep them apart. However, as the story moves on, Bikky&#x27;s respect for the man slowly increases, and while he still doesn&#x27;t fully like Dee being with Ryo he decides to stop trying to break them up, settling for &quot;loving to hate&quot; Dee instead. He is not particularly intelligent, often falling asleep in class with even Ryo admitting Bikky would only make it to college through his athleticism. Nonetheless, he is shown to be street savvy, have good common sense and instincts when it comes to people, and does possess some talent in less than legal skills such as pickpocketing, poker, and stealing tires off of bikes (things Ryo reprimands him for). By Fake Second Season, he has shot up in height (growing up taller than Dee) and dating Carol though he moves to go to college he promises to come and visit often. 
:The alternative spelling of his name is Vikky, however like Carol&#x27;s name in the OAV, they used a different spelling. When TOKYOPOP released the manga, Cal was changed back to Carol (see below), however they continued to use Bikky&#x27;s translated name throughout the series. 
:It can be assumed that Ryo adopted Bikky as when he is introduced in volume one of the original manga Bikky&#x27;s surname is Goldman, but in &#x27;FAKE &quot;Second Season&quot;&#x27; he introduces himself as Bikky Maclean.
: 
:Bikky&#x27;s childhood friend around 13 years old. She states that she doesn&#x27;t want to date anyone until she&#x27;s eighteen, because that&#x27;s when her father, who is currently in a police hospital, met her mother. She is not a stranger to crime—she hopes to collect enough money to pay her father&#x27;s bail—but her pickpocketing puts her in a dangerous situation. Flirtatious at times, she repels unwanted advances strongly, letting potential suitors know exactly what she thinks of them. Carol has extremely high self-esteem and is unlikely to let anybody get the better of her without a fight. However, despite the age difference(she&#x27;s three years older) by Fake Second Season she and Bikky are a strong couple, though she states she&#x27;ll kill him should he ever try to cheat.
:Carol&#x27;s name has also been translated as Cal or Chal. Technically, all variations are correct, and although Carol seems the most likely spelling for a Western name, &quot;Chal&quot; has in fact been used on official merchandise. Unlike Bikky, she likes the idea of Dee and Ryo as a couple and tries to help them, clocking Bikky when he goes too far.
: 
:A former classmate of Dee&#x27;s at the police academy, he is an expert marksman, second only to Ryo. He shows his serious side only rarely; his time is usually spent trying to get &quot;Sex God&quot; Dee to return his love. JJ truly believes that people are good. This is intrinsic to his worldview. He cares very strongly for those close to him, and holds a surprisingly pacifistic outlook considering his profession. JJ acts very childlike at times, and this causes his colleagues to dismiss him automatically. However he proves to be a very good listener, despite the fact that he doesn&#x27;t usually appear to be taking things in. Later in the manga, he gives up on his pursuit of Dee and accepts Ryo being with him; few days after that, he steals a kiss from his partner Drake Parker and asks him out for a date.
:
:Berkeley first encountered Ryo and Dee while the two were on holiday in the Lake District. Dee took an instant dislike to the man, and the feeling seemed to be mutual. Initially Berkeley seemed to be rumored straight; however it later becomes apparent that much of Berkeley&#x27;s hostility towards Dee stems from jealousy- he is desperately attracted to Ryo. Dee eventually begins to take notice of this, viewing Berkeley as a genuine threat rather than an object of mockery.
:Berkeley is remarkably similar to Dee in many aspects, but comes across as a colder, more distant man in the surface. He treats police work with a similar distance, letting slip comments that show he views the investigation of the English murders as something of a game. His gaze is extremely penetrating -- Ryo doesn&#x27;t like meeting his eyes. He is not afraid of abusing his position as Commissioner to get closer to what he wants. While he seems focused, Berkeley may be concentrating too hard on one thing while letting other opportunities slip away. Diana is in love with him, but Berkeley rejects her fearing his own emotions until the very end.
:An outgoing and flamboyant FBI agent, Diana enjoys sparring with Dee. As a relentless flirt who constantly violates the dress code, she is not afraid to use her sexuality as a weapon, and Bikky is in awe of her. A martial arts practitioner, Diana is fully able to defend herself in potentially dangerous situations. However, for all her brashness, Diana is truly in love with Berkeley, who treats her as more of a sister figure. She is willing to do anything to wake Berkeley up to the fact that she has desires too, and finally gets him to declare his love for her.
:JJ&#x27;s partner. A perpetual loser. Forever dumped by his girlfriends, Drake seems to be the most slobbish man in the NYPD 27th. A cheapskate, slacker and hopeless at getting up in the mornings, Drake needs to settle down with someone who cares about him enough to fix his many problems. In the manga story &quot;Like Like Love&quot;, JJ confesses to him that he&#x27;s stopped pursuing Dee, and after Drake comforts him JJ kisses him and says they should have a date to fix their love lives.
:Almost nothing is known about Ted, but as the fifth regular investigator in Ryo and Dee&#x27;s office, he deserves a mention. Like Drake, he shows little respect towards the Chief. Ted is notable for having surprised fans of the black and white manga when he made a brief appearance at the end of the OVA with flaming red hair.
:The Chief of Police at the NYPD&#x27;s 27th precinct. The badger analogies are frequent; retribution violent. While most of the NYPD show him little respect on a daily basis, Ryo in particular holds him in high esteem, and sees him as something of a father figure to the young men under his command, a fact which the others may or may not acknowledge. He seems gruff and flustered at the best of times, and rarely gives in under pressure unless he believes the matter to be trivial. In Act 11, a flashback reveals that his first name is Warren.
:A crossover character from another of Matoh Sanami&#x27;s works Ra-i. While he has a short temper and initially doesn&#x27;t get along with Bikky, the two soon become great friends. He is Asian and comes from a wealthy family with an older brother (who owns a large company and specializes in knife throwing) and an older married sister. He has a friendly rivalry with Bikky and loves Lass, whom he is protective of. He has telekinetic powers that allow him to float in mid air though he tries hard to hide it (despite the fact many have seen his abilities firsthand). Like Bikky, he is brash, aggressive, has a short temper but is kind hearted and will protect people from harm, especially those close to him.
:A crossover character from another of Matoh Sanami&#x27; works Ra-i. Unlike with Bikky and Rai, she gets along quite well with Carol upon first meeting and treat each other like sisters. She has telepathic powers that allow her to see visions like when she correctly figures out where Rai is after he is kidnapped, though tries to hide them (only Rai is fully aware). She is in love with Rai and is polite, calm, friendly, shy, and sweet.
:A forensics expert who wears glasses and has good observational skills, managing to notice Dee&#x27;s feelings for Ryo upon first meeting them and also warning Dee that people like Ryo who look nice and quiet on the outside are actually turbulent on the inside.
:The new chief of SCIU who looks over the main characters as their new boss after they move out of the 27th precinct. He had a son who was murdered by a female serial killer who murdered children because she hated their disobedient personalities, which came from her own hatred towards her own children whom she abused for misbehaving.

==Anime==
&quot;Fake&quot; was adapted into a one-hour OVA based on volume two of the manga.

The Japanese voice actor cast is notable, with such famous names as Tomokazu Seki playing Dee, Nobuo Tobita playing Ryo, and Rica Matsumoto both playing Bikky and singing the closing theme, &quot;Starlight Heaven&quot;.

It has aired in the U.S. on Logo as part of an anthology series dedicated to LGBT-themed animation and geek culture called &quot;Alien Boot Camp&quot;. It premiere in two parts, the first half on November 9, 2007, and the second a week later on November 16, 2007.

Dee and Ryo are on vacation at a charming English hotel by a lake. Ryo is hoping to get some peace and relaxation; Dee is hoping to get some Ryo. However, things take a bad turn when a dead body is found floating in the lake. Dee and Ryo don&#x27;t want to do police work when they&#x27;re on vacation, but it&#x27;s hard to avoid it when a case falls in your lap!

They meet two other guests, Arisa and Cindy. Arisa and Ryo bond over the fact that they&#x27;re both of Japanese descent while Arisa also bonds with Dee over Dee&#x27;s unrequited love, as Arisa herself had waited six years for the man she loves to propose. After a pleasant day together, strange sounds are heard in the darkness of the hotel lobby. Investigating, Ryo and Dee meet Berkeley Rose, a New York cop who has decided to investigate the murder as &quot;a fun way to kill time&quot;.

From that point on relaxation becomes impossible as surprise guests come pouring in—first Bikky and Carol, then JJ. In a town nearby, Berkeley figures out who the murderers are, and why they kill any Japanese who cross their path. Problem is, Dee just left Ryo back at the hotel with the killer, and JJ let it slip that Ryo is half-Japanese! 

Back at the mansion, Ryo, the detective and Carol, the pick pocket girl has been drugged. There, the mansion&#x27;s owner, Leonard Henry, reveals the reason he has trapped, tortured and killed Japanese persons like Arisa, and anyone unfortunate enough to witness it, like Cindy, is because the very first guests of the countryside mansion, who happened to be Japanese raped and killed his daughter, Maria-Elizabeth 5 years ago, who was 13 years old at the time of her death. After this horrible incident, in a discriminatory rage, Leonard has killed many people of Japanese descent to avenge his late daughter. He even killed the accomplice cook, whom he adopted a long time ago. 

Dee comes just at the nick of time, with a motorcycle to save his romantic partner and hands him to the police. Before going to the slammer, his one request of burning anything related to his daughter, including the giant portrait, in Leonard&#x27;s personal office is honored. 

Back at the station, Ryo and Dee see that their commissioner has been replaced with the NY cop they met at the mansion, Berkeley Rose.

<text>Pinvin is a village in Worcestershire, England, a little to the north of Pershore, about south-east of Worcester, and about north-west of Evesham and lies on the crossroads of the A44, A4104 and B4082. It is also the location of Pershore railway station. The village has a church and a pub. It also has a first school (rated Good by Ofsted) and a middle school (rated Requires Improvement by Ofsted); pre-school activities take place in the village hall.

The name is thought to come from &#x27;Penda&#x27;s fen&#x27; after the Mercian King Penda, who was probably born in the nearby Cotswolds. David Rudkin&#x27;s TV play &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; (1974) was set here and also references this fact.

<doc id="1151152" wikidata="Q6728394" url="?curid=1151152" title="Madonna and Child (Duccio, Metropolitan)">
<text>Madonna and Child was painted by one of the most influential artists of the late 13th and early 14th century, Duccio di Buoninsegna. This iconic image of the Madonna and Child, seen throughout the history of western art, holds significant value in terms of stylistic innovations of religious subject matter that would continue to evolve for centuries.

== Description and influences ==
Comparing the compact size of this work of 11×8 inches to larger, more illustrious altarpieces and large scale frescoes, the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; is understood to be an intimate, devotional image. Some evocations of this understanding come from the burnt edges on the bottom of the original engaged frame caused by burning candles that likely would have sat just beneath. Looking past the abrupt simplicity of the image, one can begin to understand the changes Duccio was applying to the depiction of religious figures in painting during the early 14th century. Duccio followed other innovative Italian artists of the time like Giotto, both of whom strove to move beyond the purely iconic Byzantine and Italo-Byzantine canon and attempted to create a more tangible connection between the viewer and the objects in the painting. For example, the parapet that sits at the bottom of the painting works as a visual enticement for the viewer to look past and into the moment that is captured between the Virgin and Christ Child. At the same time, the parapet also acts as a barrier between the vernacular world and the sacred.

== Aesthetic influences ==

Many other elements of Duccio&#x27;s interest in humanism are prevalent and can be seen in the tenderly draped robe worn by the Madonna and on Christ&#x27;s lap, the childish reach of his hand to the Virgin&#x27;s somewhat austere gaze back as she anticipates Christ&#x27;s future, the luminous colors employed to the garments, and the fine details found on the inner layer of the Virgin&#x27;s veil. It is these distinct qualities that would shape the sensibility of later Sienese painting and that give Duccio&#x27;s Madonna and Child such worthy attention and credibility in the history of art. Other details found in this image are ones that stay behind in Byzantine tradition and characterize earlier works of Duccio, while the more innovative qualities prosper over time. The tooled details in the gold ground are minute and difficult to notice at a far glance but add an important element to the image. Punched designs were employed for the halos and the border design, all of which were hand inscribed.

== History of ownership ==

As is common for duecento and trecento paintings, the ownership and location of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; before the mid 19th century is unknown. The first known owner of the painting is the Russian Count Gregori Stroganoff (1829–1910), who said he spotted it in a dealer&#x27;s shop, not attributed to any artist. In 1904 he lent it to an exhibition at the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena (&quot;Mostra d’arte antica senese&quot;). He kept it in his palazzo in Rome.

Stated in her review of the 1904 &quot;Mostra d’art senese exhibition&quot;, art historian, Mary Logan Berenson believes this work to be among Duccio&#x27;s “most perfect” pieces, therefore it is no surprise the painting caused an awe-inspiring reaction from exhibition viewers and especially from those in the art and art history arena. Following the death of Stroganoff in 1910, the Duccio joined the assembly of works collected by Adolphe Stoclet (1871–1949), hence the painting&#x27;s namesake, the &quot;Stoclet Madonna&quot;. Stoclet was understood to treat his fruitful collection of art with the most careful attention and held them in the most ideal environments to preserve their unique, and many times fragile, qualities. The Duccio was shown at few exhibitions in 1930 and 1935 and to chosen, limited guests of Stoclet at his home.

Following the death of Stoclet and his wife in 1949, their children inherited Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; along with the rest of the collector&#x27;s assemblage. Although the coveted work of art was of interest to scholars, they were unable to access it except through photographs that fortunately document the ages of the painting and its process of restoration. Photographs of before it was restored, and later minor retouching, to what we see now all of which reveal the time past and the true impression of the original painting of 1300. The painting was excitingly acquired in the autumn of 2004 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an estimated amount of 45 million USD. This is a highly valuable acquisition not only for the aesthetic significance in terms of the history of art, but also because there are only 13 known paintings by Duccio in the world.

== Controversy ==

There is debate between scholars of what the most accurate chronology of Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; is. There is more than 20 years of time where scholars do not have accounted works by Duccio leaving a questionable, although fairly certain estimation of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; to be made around 1300. Due to the fact that some qualities of the painting are Bysantinesque like the oval shape of the Virgin&#x27;s face and her elegantly long nose, and also of the “miniature man” nature of Christ Child, the lack of consensus of when it was created proceeds. But, there are of course many innovative elements to the painting which align it appropriately in the time that is now acknowledged to be most accurate. Along with the humanistic qualities between the Virgin and Christ Child, and the elegant draping, the marble parapet is a notable detail to the intentions of the painting, and serves as a visual invitation that encourages the viewer to engage more emotionally to the image. This idea would continue on in a myriad of paintings proceeding this work.

==Attribution==

The late James Beck, Professor of Art History at Columbia University in New York, believed that Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, which the Met dates to 1300, is the work of a 19th-century artist or forger based on stylistic grounds. He pointed to what he considers to be the low quality of the painting and elements of content that he claims had not yet appeared in artwork of that period. Professor Beck said: &quot;We are asked to believe that the modest little picture represents a leap into the future of Western painting by establishing a plane in front of Mary and the Child. This feature, a characteristic of Renaissance not Medieval pictures, occurs only a hundred years after the presumptive date of the picture ...&quot;. Beck&#x27;s conclusions were published in 2007 in his book, &quot;From Duccio to Raphael: Connoisseurship in Crisis&quot; in which he also disputes the attribution of the National Gallery of London&#x27;s painting &quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot; to Raphael.

Keith Christiansen, the Met&#x27;s curator of European paintings, disagrees with Beck&#x27;s contention. Christiansen has noted that, in addition to stylistic analysis of the painting in relation to other known works by the painter, the museum conducted a thorough examination of the painting, including the wooden panel&#x27;s construction, the painting&#x27;s underdrawing and pigment composition and found them consistent with an attribution to Duccio and a date of around 1300. Christiansen said: &quot;What everyone else sees as a sign of quality and innovation, Beck sees as weakness. There is no reason to doubt the period and authenticity of the picture.&quot;

<doc id="1151157" wikidata="Q3844222" url="?curid=1151157" title="Man of Miracles">
<text>Man of Miracles is the fourth album by Styx, released in October 1974. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album charts on November 9, where it reached No. 154.

This would be the band&#x27;s last original album on the independent Chicago-based label Wooden Nickel Records before moving to the major label A&amp;M.

==Background==

The album had a diverse sound, it showcased the style of two band members and a pre-commercial sound: James &quot;JY&quot; Young songs were more straight ahead hard rockers, while Dennis DeYoung songs were more mellow ballads, classical, and prog rock songs.

The original issue contained the catchy upbeat cover of &quot;Lies&quot; by The Knickerbockers in 1965. A second release of &quot;Man of Miracles&quot; substituted this with &quot;Best Thing&quot;, a song also contained on the first Styx album from 1972, as the opening track on side two. The album was again reissued in 1980 with new artwork and a newly abbreviated title, Miracles. This version started the second side with the ballad &quot;Unfinished Song&quot;, which is sung by Dennis DeYoung.

==Track listing==


==Personnel==
===Styx===
* Dennis DeYoung – vocals, keyboards
* James &quot;JY&quot; Young – vocals, electric guitars
* John Curulewski – vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, synthesizers
* Chuck Panozzo – bass guitar
* John Panozzo – drums, percussion

===Production===
* Producer: John Ryan for Chicago Kid Productions
* Engineer: Gary Loizzo

==Artwork==
The cover art was designed by Leon Rosenblatt, whose name is printed on the back credits as &quot;Lee Rosenblatt.&quot;

==Miscellaneous==
The initials &quot;LJR&quot; are plainly visible in the wizard&#x27;s beard, and were likely hidden there by the album&#x27;s artist, Leon J. Rosenblatt.

<doc id="1151161" wikidata="Q7322943" url="?curid=1151161" title="Riccarton, New Zealand">
<text>Riccarton is a suburb of Christchurch. It is due west of the city centre, separated from it by Hagley Park. Upper Riccarton is to the west of Riccarton.

==History==
On 12 April 1840, the ship &quot;Sarah and Elizabeth&quot; landed Herriot, McGillivray, Ellis, Shaw (and wife) and McKinnon (with his wife and child) who established a farm at Riccarton. They were the first European settlers on the plains.&quot; In January 1841, they abandoned their attempt to farm in the area.

Riccarton House was the homestead commissioned by Jane Deans in circa 1855. The Deans brothers, who along with the Gebbies and the Mansons were the second group of Europeans to settle in Christchurch on the same site as the first group in 1843. Their original cottage is on the grounds, moved twice from its original position. Riccarton House is now a restaurant and function centre, and conducts regular tours. The Deans brothers, John and William, named the suburb after the parish in Ayrshire, Scotland, in which they were born. They were also responsible for naming the River Avon after the river of the same name in Lanarkshire, Scotland.

Antonio Hall is located on Riccarton Road. A large property with 279 rooms and once described as &quot;one of the finest in Christchurch and vicinity&quot;, it has been left to decay despite a Category II listing with Heritage New Zealand. In July 2019, 30% of the building was lost to a fire started by a 14 year old youth.

The Al Noor Mosque on Deans Avenue was the site of a mass shooting during the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019.

==Riccarton Bush==
Adjacent to Riccarton House is Riccarton Bush, a prominent feature also known as Deans Bush (). The Māori word &quot;Pūtaringamotu&quot; means either &#x27;the place of an echo&#x27; or &#x27;the severed ear&#x27;. The latter is a metaphoric expression referring to &#x27;bush isolated from the rest&#x27;. It is one of only four remnants of the original forest that covered the Canterbury plains, escaping the huge fires that swept across the province during the moa hunter period. Another remnant, at Papanui, was cut down in the 1850s. The other two remnants were at Kaiapoi and Rangiora. It is dominated by kahikatea trees. A predator-proof perimeter fence has now been erected, with the hope of reintroducing kiwi to the reserve. In 1848, Scots brothers John and William Deans signed an agreement with the New Zealand Company to protect what was originally about 22 hectares of the kahikatea forest at Pūtaringamotu. In 1914, the 6.4 hectares that remained of Deans Bush was formally protected, with the passing of the Riccarton Bush Act 1914, spearheaded by prominent citizens of Christchurch, including Harry Ell and botanist Dr. Leonard Cockayne.

Riccarton Bush has played an important role in the history of New Zealand entomology. A number of native insects were first collected and named from Riccarton Bush. One of the first collections was of a plume moth &quot;Pterophorus monospilalis&quot; in 1859 which is now in the Fereday collection held in the Canterbury Museum. Thirty nine families of Lepidoptera are found in New Zealand; 27 of these occur in Riccarton Bush. The moths of Riccarton Bush represent the majority of these families. The bag moth &quot;Mallobathra metrosema&quot; is only known to occur in Riccarton Bush.

==Riccarton Racecourse Hotel==
The Riccarton Racecourse Hotel is considered to be one of the most haunted places in New Zealand. It is said that the ghost of former licensee Donald Fraser walks the corridors of the hotel looking for his killer. In 1933, Fraser was murdered in the dead of night in his bedroom, where his wife was sleeping, by two blasts from a double-barrelled shotgun. Despite investigations, nobody was found guilty of the crime.

==Governance==
Until local government amalgamation in 1989, Riccarton was an independent borough. Since then, Riccarton is represented by the Halswell-Hornby-Riccarton community board. In the 2018 local government elections, Catherine Chu was elected as Councillor for the Riccarton ward. In the following local government election held in October 2022, she was replaced by speaker, consultant, and basketball coach Tyla Harrison-Hunt.

<doc id="1151168" wikidata="Q984214" url="?curid=1151168" title="Whitecourt">
<text>Whitecourt is a town in Northern Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by Woodlands County. It is approximately northwest of Edmonton and southeast of Grande Prairie at the junction of Highway 43 and Highway 32. It has an elevation of .

Whitecourt is also located at the confluence of four waterways – the Athabasca River, McLeod River, Sakwatamau River and Beaver Creek. A Canadian National rail line runs through the town.

The Town has branded itself as the &quot;Snowmobile Capital of Alberta&quot; and its motto is &quot;Let&#x27;s Go...&quot;. The Whitecourt meteor impact crater is found on nearby Whitecourt Mountain.

== History ==
The community was formed in the place known by the Cree as &quot;Sagitawah&quot; (the place where the rivers meet). While the first Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post was established in 1897, the first permanent resident on the present day town site was John Goodwin, who settled there in 1905. 

In early 1910, MLA Peter Gunn announced that a government wagon road had been opened from Entwistle to Whitecourt. With the expansion of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1910, immigrants were encouraged by Premier Arthur Lewis Sifton to settle in the vast scarcely inhabited area between Edmonton and the Peace River Country.

With the growth of settlement in the area and as it was on the route to the Pine Pass through the Rockies, the Canadian Northern Railway line was planned to be completed to Whitecourt in 1913. But it was not until after that railway company was rolled into the Canadian National that Whitecourt got a railway connection. 

The name &quot;Whitecourt&quot; was chosen in 1909 by Walter White, the postmaster of the young community. White was the son-in-law of former Kansas governor John W. Leedy who also settled in the community. The name conformed to the style of the name of Green Court, White&#x27;s previous hometown, located nearby

;Roads
The Town of Whitecourt is served by two highways. Highway 43, which is part of the CANAMEX Corridor, is a twinned highway that provides connection to Edmonton to the southeast and Grande Prairie to the northwest.

Highway 32 provides Whitecourt with a direct link to the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16) to the south, which connects the town to Edson and Hinton to the southwest. Another segment of Highway 32 begins approximately northwest of the town, providing a link from Highway 43 to Swan Hills and Slave Lake.

Numerous local roads provide connections from Whitecourt to surrounding rural areas within Woodlands County. Within the McLeod River valley, Govenlock Road feeds two rural roads – West Mountain Road (Range Road 122) and Tower Road (Range Road 121A) – that provide access to numerous country residential subdivisions and some agricultural operations to the south.

Within the Athabasca River valley, Flats Road (Township Road 600), which exits the town following its northern boundary, serves numerous agricultural operations to the east.

On the Hilltop, 41 Avenue (Township Road 594A), which was the original highway alignment into Whitecourt, exits the town eastbound for the Hamlet of Blue Ridge. This road is commonly referred to as Blue Ridge Road.

<text>Puerto Madryn (; ), usually known as Madryn, is a city in the province of Chubut in Argentine Patagonia. It is the capital of the Viedma Department, and has about 103,175 inhabitants according to the last census in 2022.

Puerto Madryn is protected by the Golfo Nuevo, which is formed by the Península Valdés and the Punta Ninfas. It is an important centre for tourists visiting the natural attractions of the Península Valdés and the coast.

The name of the city conmemorates Love Jones Parry, one of the colonizers of Patagonia. The toponym originated around 1863, when Love Jones Parry, along with Lewis Jones travelled to Patagonia aboard &quot;Candelaría&quot; to decide whether that region was adequate for a Welsh colony.

A new shopping mall in the city centre has helped tourism develop significantly, making Puerto Madryn a more attractive place for both international and domestic tourists visiting Patagonia. It is twinned with Nefyn, a small town on the Llŷn Peninsula in North Wales, the result of its enduring link with Welsh culture since the Welsh settlement in Argentina. The first of a two-Test tour to Argentina by the Wales national rugby union team was played in 2006 in Puerto Madryn, a 27–25 win for Argentina. Puerto Madryn is home to two football clubs; Club Social y Atlético Guillermo Brown, who play in Nacional B and Deportivo Madryn that currently play in Torneo Argentino B.

A basketball team, Deportivo Puerto Madryn, plays in the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol (LNB). Their home arena is known as the Deportivo Puerto Madryn Arena.

El Tehuelche Airport is located 10 km (6 miles) northwest of the city centre. Commercial flights from Buenos Aires, Ushuaia, and other Argentinian cities are available. Most tourists fly into Trelew Airport as flights into Puerto Madryn are restricted as a result of environmental concerns.

==Geography==
Puerto Madryn is situated in Chubut on the Golfo Nuevo, which is formed by the Valdés Peninsula and Punta Ninfas. Puerto Madryn features a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with an annual precipitation of between 150 and 200 mm (6&quot; to 8&quot;).
==History==
The town was founded on 28 July 1865, when 150 Welsh immigrants arriving aboard the clipper &quot;Mimosa&quot; named the natural port &quot;Porth Madryn&quot; in honour of Sir Love Jones-Parry, whose estate in Wales was called Madryn after the Welsh name for Saint Materiana. Conditions were difficult and the settlers had to dig irrigation ditches for their first crops.

The settlement grew as a result of the building of the Central Chubut Railway by Welsh, Spanish, and Italian immigrants. This line, opened in 1889, linked the town to Trelew via the lower Chubut River valley.

Puerto Madryn was the port to which Argentine prisoners of war captured in the Falklands Islands during the 1982 war were repatriated on the vessels SS Canberra MV St. Edmund and MV Norland, which sailed from Port Stanley on 18 June 1982.

<doc id="1151177" wikidata="Q5451374" url="?curid=1151177" title="Fire Island Lighthouse">
<text>The Fire Island Lighthouse is a visible landmark on the Great South Bay, in southern Suffolk County, New York on the western end of Fire Island, a barrier island off the southern coast of Long Island. The lighthouse is located within Fire Island National Seashore and just to the east of Robert Moses State Park. It is part of the Fire Island Light Station which contains the light, keepers quarters, the lens building containing the original first-order Fresnel lens, and a boat house.

==History==

The current lighthouse is a stone tower that began operation in 1858 to replace the tower originally built in 1826. The United States Coast Guard decommissioned the light in 1974. In 1982 the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society (FILPS) was formed to preserve the lighthouse. FILPS raised over $1.2 million to restore the tower and light. On May 25, 1986 the United States Coast Guard returned the Fire Island Lighthouse to an active aid to navigation. On February 22, 2006, the light became a private aid to navigation. It continues to be on the nautical charts, but is operated and maintained by the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society and not the USCG. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and a boundary increase for the national historic district occurred in 2010.

It is listed as Fire Island Light, number 695, in the USCG light lists.

When the lighthouse was built it was on the edge of Fire Island Inlet and marked the western end of Fire Island. However Fire Island has extended itself through accumulating sand so that the lighthouse is now nearly from the western end of the island at Democrat Point.

The Archives Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History has a collection (#1055) of souvenir postcards of lighthouses and has digitized 272 of these and made them available online. These include postcards of Fire Island Light with links to customized nautical charts provided by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

The lighthouse celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008, the same year as the 100th anniversary of Robert Moses State Park.

==Access==

The lighthouse can be accessed by a short walk from Robert Moses State Park Field 5. It is open to the public daily. Tower tours are available for a small fee.

==In popular culture==
From 1970 to 1975, the lighthouse and its surrounding area were seen in the opening and closing credits sequences of the CBS television soap opera &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;.

Some of the final episode of season 1 of TV show &quot;The Following&quot; was filmed at Fire Island Lighthouse and surrounding buildings.

&quot;Men in Black II&quot; also included some filming on the island in the immediate vicinity of the lighthouse.

A 1999 Channel 4 TV series featuring Stephen Fry and called &quot;Fire Island&quot; included filming of the lighthouse.

The 2008 movie &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; with Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher featured the lighthouse as Diaz character&#x27;s favorite place.

<doc id="1151179" wikidata="Q4040100" url="?curid=1151179" title="HMS Ganges (1782)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched in 1782 at Rotherhithe. She was the first ship of the Navy to bear the name, and was the name ship of her class. She saw active service from 1782 to 1811, in Europe and the West Indies.

==Origins==
The British East India Company had Randall build a 74-gun ship under the name &quot;Bengal&quot;. They then presented (donated) her to the Royal Navy, which renamed her HMS &quot;Ganges&quot;.

The Royal Navy commissioned &quot;Ganges&quot; in February 1782 under the command of Captain Charles Fielding. She was paid-off in March, but immediately recommissioned under Captain J. Lutterell as a guardship at Portsmouth. Between 1784 and 1787, she was under the command of Captain Sir Roger Curtis. In October 1787 she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Drake. She was recommissioned in December 1790 under Captain Anthony Molloy.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
In 1794, whilst under the command of Captain William Truscott, she and captured the French corvette &quot;Jacobine&quot;. &quot;Jacobin&quot; was armed with twenty-four 12-pounder guns, and had a crew of 220 men; she was nine days out of Brest and had taken nothing. The Royal Navy took &quot;Jacobin&quot; into service as HMS &quot;Matilda&quot;.

&quot;Ganges&quot; was part of the squadron commanded by Admiral John Gell, which escorted a Spanish ship they had captured from the French back to Portsmouth. The ownership of the ship was a matter of some debate and was not settled until 4 February 1795, when the value of the cargo was put at £935,000. At this time all the crew, captains, officers and admirals received a share of the prize money, Admiral Hood taking away £50,000. Besides &quot;Ganges&quot;, the ships that conveyed the Spanish prize to Portsmouth were , , and .

&quot;Ganges&quot; shared in the prize money from the capture of the French supply ship &quot;Marsouin&quot; by on 11 March 1796.
&quot;Ganges&quot; was under the command of Captain Thomas Fremantle at the Battle of Copenhagen. She had on board a contingent of soldiers from the 49th Foot, commanded by Isaac Brock. Their mission was to storm the forts at Copenhagen, but the outcome of the naval battle made the assault unnecessary.

==Napoleonic Wars==
&quot;Ganges&quot; was one of six British warships that shared in the capture on 23 August 1807 of the Danish vessel &quot;Speculation&quot;.

&quot;Ganges&quot; was also present at the Second Battle of Copenhagen. She bore the flag of Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats, and was commanded by Captain Peter Halkett. During the battle Keats placed a portrait of Admiral Nelson on the mizzen mast where it was said to have encouraged officers and men alike despite being covered in the blood and brains of an unfortunate seaman.

In September 1810, two row-boat luggers, one from , under the command of Lieutenant Robert Streatfield, and one from &quot;Ganges&quot;, under the command Lieutenants Stackpole, captured two Danish armed vessels off Lessoe. There were no British casualties.

==Fate==
She was commissioned as a prison ship on 12 December 1811 for holding prisoners of war. Then in 1814 she was transferred to the Transport Board. &quot;Ganges&quot; was broken up at Plymouth in 1816.

<doc id="1151203" wikidata="Q7732067" url="?curid=1151203" title="The End Is Near (Five Iron Frenzy album)">
<text>The End is Near is the fifth studio album by the American band Five Iron Frenzy, self-released on June 18, 2003. The album was later widely re-released as a part of double album titled The End is Here (stylized as The End is Near Here) by Five Minute Walk Records on April 20, 2004. The double album includes both the studio album and a live recording of the band&#x27;s final concert performance. The album was intended as the band&#x27;s last as was the tour used to promote it, until the band announced a reunion in 2011 and new album, &quot;Engine of a Million Plots&quot; released in 2013.

==Packaging and release==

&quot;The End is Near&quot; was recorded in early 2003 and sold directly by the band during their farewell tour and through their official website. The cover and packaging artwork was done by Doug TenNapel, the visual artist who had previously worked on three other Five Iron Frenzy covers. The packaging for &quot;The End is Near&quot; features a red motif for the cover and artwork while the re-release, &quot;The End is Here&quot;, includes a green layout. Otherwise, both versions contain the same artwork by TenNapel. The earlier self-released version is missing a barcode and instead included a blank space reading &quot;I LAST SAW FIVE IRON FRENZY ON&quot; which the band themselves stamped with that day&#x27;s date when sold from their merchandise tables on their farewell tour.

On November 22, 2003 at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado, the band played their final show and recorded it. On April 20, 2004, the double-disc set &quot;The End is Here&quot; (stylized as &quot;The End is Near Here&quot;) was released for widely distributed retail. This set includes the studio album and the final performance on two separate discs. An exclusive inclusion on the double-disc set was one extra studio track &quot;The Cross of Saint Andrew&quot; which was not included on the earlier self-released version of the studio album.

Both versions of the CD were packaged with a cardboard slipcover over the standard CD jewel case, which was bundled with a high-quality 15-page booklet containing band photographs, artwork by TenNapel, lyrics and words of farewell to the fans. Inside the front lid of the jewel case of the earlier self-released version was a simple one-sheet reproduction of the cover, while inside the front lid of the double-disc set was a fold-out poster featuring a collage of photographs from the band&#x27;s farewell performance.

== Music ==
The song &quot;Wizard Needs Food, Badly&quot; is a reference to the 1985 arcade game Gauntlet, and the song features a sample of the line spoken in the video game. &quot;That&#x27;s How the Story Ends&quot; is a song stylized along the lines of &quot;The Raven,&quot; a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Backmasking dialog at the beginning of the song is lead singer Reese Roper saying &quot;Sandwiches, they make the best friends.&quot; Lyrically the song makes reference to past Five Iron Frenzy songs and gives epilogues to the narrative of those songs. The songs referenced are &quot;Where Is Micah?&quot;, &quot;Blue Comb &#x27;78&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, &quot;The Untimely Death of Brad&quot;, &quot;These Are Not My Pants (The Rock Opera)&quot;, &quot;Combat Chuck&quot;, &quot;Kitty Doggy&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of the Dinosaurs&quot;. The coda of the song &quot;On Distant Shores&quot; is borrowed from Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s &quot;Every New Day,&quot; a song that closed all their live performances.

Both versions of the studio album feature a hidden track of Five Iron Frenzy talking in the recording studio. Additionally, the studio album on the double-disc set features a second hidden track composed of outtakes from the final performance which includes mostly stage banter that was cut from the second disc for pacing purposes.

Included in the live performance of their final show is a medley of Five Iron Frenzy performing selections from popular songs they were unable to perform in their entirety during the show. This track is inexplicably absent from recent digital versions of the album like those on Spotify and iTunes. No exact reasons for this exclusion has been stated by the band. It can also be noted that no permission is listed in the album&#x27;s copyright notes for the inclusion of the Dan Hill song &quot;Sometimes When We Touch.&quot; The medley is broken down as follows:

#[0:00 - 2:20] - &quot;A Flowery Song&quot; (&quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;)
#[2:20 - 2:52] - &quot;Suckerpunch&quot; (&quot;Our Newest Album Ever!&quot;)
#[2:52 - 4:00] - &quot;One Girl Army&quot; (&quot;Quantity Is Job 1&quot;)
#[4:00 - 4:36] - &quot;My Evil Plan To Save The World&quot; (&quot;Quantity Is Job 1&quot;)
#[4:36 - 5:20] - &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot; (Dan Hill&#x27;s &quot;Longer Fuse&quot;)
#[5:20 - 5:56] - &quot;Pre-Ex Girlfriend&quot; (&quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot;)
#[5:56 - 6:31] - &quot;Combat Chuck&quot; (&quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;)
#[6:31 - 7:08] - &quot;Dandelions&quot; (&quot;Quantity Is Job 1&quot;)
#[7:08 - 7:31] - &quot;Superpowers&quot; (&quot;Our Newest Album Ever!&quot;)
#[7:31 - 8:05] - &quot;Cool Enough For You&quot; (&quot;Upbeats and Beatdowns&quot;)

== Reception ==
Both the original version of the studio album and the double-disc studio and live set received positive reviews.

Jesus Freak Hideout reviewed the album of its original self-released form and gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 rating. &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; also reviewing the first version of the studio album gave it a 10 out of 10.

Reviewing the double disc set &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; gave it a five out of five. Likewise, &quot;HM Magazine&quot; music critic Doug Van Pelt stated that the live material captured the raw energy and spiritual fervor that the band was known for.

<doc id="1151206" wikidata="Q7236612" url="?curid=1151206" title="Power series solution of differential equations">
<text>In mathematics, the power series method is used to seek a power series solution to certain differential equations. In general, such a solution assumes a power series with unknown coefficients, then substitutes that solution into the differential equation to find a recurrence relation for the coefficients.

== Method ==
Consider the second-order linear differential equation
formula_1
Suppose is nonzero for all . Then we can divide throughout to obtain
formula_2
Suppose further that and are analytic functions.

The power series method calls for the construction of a power series solution
formula_3

If is zero for some , then the Frobenius method, a variation on this method, is suited to deal with so called &quot;singular points&quot;. The method works analogously for higher order equations as well as for systems.

== Example usage ==
Let us look at the Hermite differential equation,
formula_4

We can try to construct a series solution
formula_5

Substituting these in the differential equation
formula_6

Making a shift on the first sum
formula_7

If this series is a solution, then all these coefficients must be zero, so for both &quot;k&quot;=0 and &quot;k&quot;&gt;0:
formula_8

We can rearrange this to get a recurrence relation for .
formula_9
formula_10

Now, we have
formula_11

We can determine &quot;A&quot;0 and &quot;A&quot;1 if there are initial conditions, i.e. if we have an initial value problem.

So we have
formula_12
and the series solution is
formula_13
which we can break up into the sum of two linearly independent series solutions:
formula_14
which can be further simplified by the use of hypergeometric series.

== A simpler way using Taylor series ==
A much simpler way of solving this equation (and power series solution in general) using the Taylor series form of the expansion.
Here we assume the answer is of the form
formula_15

If we do this, the general rule for obtaining the recurrence relationship for the coefficients is 
formula_16
and
formula_17

In this case we can solve the Hermite equation in fewer steps:
formula_18
becomes
formula_19
or
formula_20
in the series 
formula_15

==Nonlinear equations==
The power series method can be applied to certain nonlinear differential equations, though with less flexibility. A very large class of nonlinear equations can be solved analytically by using the Parker–Sochacki method. Since the Parker–Sochacki method involves an expansion of the original system of ordinary differential equations through auxiliary equations, it is not simply referred to as the power series method. The Parker–Sochacki method is done before the power series method to make the power series method possible on many nonlinear problems. An ODE problem can be expanded with the auxiliary variables which make the power series method trivial for an equivalent, larger system. Expanding the ODE problem with auxiliary variables produces the same coefficients (since the power series for a function is unique) at the cost of also calculating the coefficients of auxiliary equations. Many times, without using auxiliary variables, there is no known way to get the power series for the solution to a system, hence the power series method alone is difficult to apply to most nonlinear equations.

The power series method will give solutions only to initial value problems (opposed to boundary value problems), this is not an issue when dealing with linear equations since the solution may turn up multiple linearly independent solutions which may be combined (by superposition) to solve boundary value problems as well. A further restriction is that the series coefficients will be specified by a nonlinear recurrence (the nonlinearities are inherited from the differential equation).

In order for the solution method to work, as in linear equations, it is necessary to express every term in the nonlinear equation as a power series so that all of the terms may be combined into one power series.

As an example, consider the initial value problem
formula_22
which describes a solution to capillary-driven flow in a groove. There are two nonlinearities: the first and second terms involve products. The initial values are given at formula_23, which hints that the power series must be set up as:
formula_24
since in this way
formula_25
which makes the initial values very easy to evaluate. It is necessary to rewrite the equation slightly in light of the definition of the power series,
formula_26
so that the third term contains the same form formula_27 that shows in the power series.

The last consideration is what to do with the products; substituting the power series in would result in products of power series when it&#x27;s necessary that each term be its own power series. This is where the Cauchy product
formula_28
is useful; substituting the power series into the differential equation and applying this identity leads to an equation where every term is a power series. After much rearrangement, the recurrence
formula_29
is obtained, specifying exact values of the series coefficients. From the initial values, formula_30 and formula_31, thereafter the above recurrence is used. For example, the next few coefficients:
formula_32

A limitation of the power series solution shows itself in this example. A numeric solution of the problem shows that the function is smooth and always decreasing to the left of formula_23, and zero to the right. At formula_23, a slope discontinuity exists, a feature which the power series is incapable of rendering, for this reason the series solution continues decreasing to the right of formula_23 instead of suddenly becoming zero.

<doc id="1151210" wikidata="Q3522651" url="?curid=1151210" title="The Serpent Is Rising">
<text>The Serpent Is Rising is the third album by American band Styx, released in October 1973, a mere three months after their previous album &quot;Styx II&quot; in July 1973.

The album was reissued in 1980 with new artwork and a new title, Serpent.

The album peaked at #192 on the Billboard 200, their second-lowest charting album, and as of 2007 has sold fewer than 100,000 copies worldwide.

==Songs and reception==
Described as a loose concept album, &quot;The Serpent Is Rising&quot; contains a number of sexual innuendos. The baroque prog &quot;The Grove of Eglantine&quot; (written by DeYoung) was about a woman&#x27;s vagina. It has some harpsichord and accordion, to give a British/European sound.

The proggish title track was written by John Curulewski, is about the serpent beginning to rise. Musically, it has some King Crimson influence especially on their debut album.

The screaming spoken word &quot;Krakatoa&quot; by Curulewski was named for the volcano event of the same name in 1883. It features an ending glissando which was taken from a Beaver and Krause track called &quot;Spaced&quot; in 1970, for which they were credited on the album.

The acoustic bluesy track &quot;As Bad as This&quot; by Curulewski has a hidden track called &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down on the Plexiglas Toilet&quot; which is a calypso humor about a boy who is sitting on a Plexiglas toilet and having problems. The track features only Curulewski and the Panozzo brothers. The song was played on the Dr. Demento radio show and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic supposedly loved it.

The album also includes James Young rockers &quot;Witch Wolf&quot; and &quot;Young Man&quot;, the upbeat &quot;Winner Take All&quot; (written by DeYoung and sung by Young) and the boogie-woogie track &quot;22 Years&quot; (written by Curulewski but sung as a duet by DeYoung and Young); the outro for that track features the producer and president of Wooden Nickel records Bill Traut on saxophone.

The prog rocker &quot;Jonas Psalter&quot; was written by DeYoung and sung by Young. Lyrically, it was about pirates. Musically, it has elements of the contemporary sound of Yes, and also featured a Moog synthesizer.

The album finished with Handel&#x27;s Hallelujah classical piece, features all the band members singing and DeYoung played a pipe organ on cathedral in Chicago.

Styx considers &quot;The Serpent Is Rising&quot; to be their worst recording. Dennis DeYoung is indirectly quoted as saying it was &quot;one of the worst recorded and produced in the history of music.&quot;

<text>is a river in Gwynedd, Wales, which has its source in a wide area north of Dduallt in Snowdonia. It is 28 miles (45 km) in length, and is much branched; many of the significant tributaries are of a similar size to the main river. The catchment area is bounded to the east by the Aran Fawddwy massif and to the west and north by the Harlech dome which forms a watershed just south of Llyn Trawsfynydd.

The Mawddach has been the site of significant industrialisation and land management. Gold mining and subsequently gold panning have had major impacts but forestry, the preparation of animal skins, the storage of old munitions and the use of hill-sides as artillery ranges have all added to the legacy of pollution. The river is also very &quot;flashy&quot; - prone to very rapid rise and fall in level depending on rainfall. Rainfall can also be very heavy and it falls on very base-poor soils leading to episodes of strongly depressed pH. Despite this, the river sustains an important salmon and trout fishery and the countryside through which it flows is some of the most spectacular and scenic in the UK.

The main tributaries starting in the west and working clockwise are:
*Afon Cwm Mynach which drains Llyn Cwm Mynach on the Rhinogydd.
*Afon Gamlan which joins at Ganllwyd after following a tumultuous valley through ancient oak woods before descending towards the main river down Rhaeadr Ddu (&quot;Black waterfalls&quot;). This valley has one of the more important moss and liverwort communities in the southern UK.
*Afon Eden - its headwaters known as Afon Crawcwellt - a large tributary draining from below Llyn Trawsfynydd and closely following the A470 through the Coed-y-Brenin forest. This tributary has been severely affected by industrialisation in the past, including gold mining and its use as an ordnance range.
*Afon Gain, a large tributary which has also been impacted by similar problems to the Eden and is very acidic and peaty.
*Afon Wen which joins south of the Gain is similar but smaller.
*Afon Wnion is a major tributary joining from the east and which drains a large area out towards Aran Fawddwy

==Estuary==
Below Dolgellau the river enters a wide and sandy estuary of great beauty. The head of the estuary is marked by the confluence of the Mawddach and Wnion. At its mouth is the town of Barmouth and its railway bridge. 

=== Geology ===
The Mawddach estuary was formed from a glaciated valley which was flooded by the sea during the Holocene glacial retreat to form a fjord. 

The valley occupied by the present Mawddach was later infilled by coarse-grained sub-glacial and pro-glacial deposits. In the Holocene (12,000 BP - present), gravel from the Irish Sea was introduced to the estuary.

=== Human history ===
The southern bank of the Mawddach estuary, along which used to run a section of the GWR branch line from Ruabon to Barmouth, has now been designated the Mawddach Trail, an 8-mile cycle path running from Dolgellau to Morfa Mawddach, at the south side of the Barmouth railway bridge. It is managed by the Eryri National Park Authority as a leisure route for walkers and cyclists, and is part of the Sustrans Cross-Wales Cycling Route.

The estuary of the Mawddach was a great centre of ship building in the 18th century and probably for some centuries before. There is no evidence remaining of this activity in the estuary today.

<text>The Historic Arkansas Museum (HAM) is a state history museum in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas.

The museum was created as part of the Arkansas Territorial Capitol Restoration Commission, by Act 388 of the 1939 Arkansas General Assembly. The act named Louise Loughborough as chairwoman of the commission. Loughborough had been named to the Little Rock Planning Commission in 1935. Several houses near Cumberland and East 3rd Streets in downtown Little Rock were going to be condemned, including the Hinderliter House, the oldest building in Little Rock. Loughborough started a public relations campaign around Little Rock as a &quot;town of three Capitols&quot;: the Hinderliter House, the Old State House, and the current Arkansas State Capitol Building. Use of the Hinderliter House as the last meeting place of the Arkansas Territorial Legislature has remained part of popular folklore, though it is not known if it was used for this purpose. Loughborough then gained support from the Works Progress Administration, the Arkansas General Assembly, and private donors. Loughborough worked with architect Max Mayer to restore the half-block of houses at Cumberland and East 3rd Street in downtown Little Rock. The Museum opened on July 19, 1941.

The museum maintains gallery space and a number of historic buildings original to the site, as well as log structures transported from around the state. It was previously known as the Arkansas Territorial Restoration, but the name was changed in 2001 when new exhibit space and renovations were completed. The museum is an affiliate within the Smithsonian Affiliations program. The museum property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 as the Arkansas Territorial Restoration Historic District.

<text>Karel August Goeyvaerts (8 June 1923 – 3 February 1993) was a Belgian composer.

==Life==
Goeyvaerts was born in Antwerp, where he studied at the Royal Flemish Music Conservatory; he later studied composition in Paris with Darius Milhaud and analysis with Olivier Messiaen. He also studied ondes Martenot with Maurice Martenot, who invented the instrument.

In 1951, Goeyvaerts attended the famous Darmstadt New Music Summer School where he met Karlheinz Stockhausen, who was five years his junior. Both were devout Catholics and found ways of integrating religious numerology into their serial compositions. They found themselves deep in conversation, and performed a movement from Goeyvaerts&#x27;s &quot;Nummer 1&quot;, Sonata for Two Pianos, in the composition course by Theodor Adorno there. They were both astonished upon hearing for the first time Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Mode de valeurs et d&#x27;intensités&quot; (from &quot;Quatre études de rythme&quot;), in a recording by the composer which Antoine Goléa played at a lecture. These experiences together convinced Stockhausen he should study with Messiaen.

Goeyvaerts became excited in 1952 when he learned that Stockhausen had access in Paris to a generator of sine waves. Goeyvaerts saw them as an important discovery for music: the purest sound possible. At the time, Stockhausen did not share his enthusiasm, owing partly to the inability with the equipment at hand to superimpose sine tones. Only later, after taking up his new post at the NWDR Electronic Music Studio in Cologne, did Stockhausen find more suitable equipment, in July 1953. One of the first works produced there was Goeyvaerts&#x27;s &quot;Nr. 5 with Pure Tones&quot;, which Stockhausen helped his friend to realize. (When Stockhausen seemingly abandoned his work with sine waves and returned to writing compositions for solo piano, Goeyvaerts felt that Stockhausen was abandoning an important discovery and took up the matter from a philosophical point of view himself.)

There has been some controversy about who wrote the first European &quot;total&quot; serial composition. His &quot;Nummer 2&quot; (1951) for 13 instruments is one of the contenders, as is his &quot;Nummer 1&quot; (1950) Sonata for Two Pianos, and the Sonata for Two Pianos by Michel Fano (1950), depending on definitions of &quot;total serialism&quot;.

After withdrawing from the musical world for a while, he accepted a position in 1970 at the Institute for Psychoacoustic and Electronic Music (IPEM) in Ghent, which led to several other appointments in Belgium. His works from after 1975 take on aspects of minimalism, the best-known examples being his series of five &quot;Litanies&quot; (1979–82) and his final work, the opera &quot;Aquarius&quot; (1983–92). Though minimalism is ordinarily thought of as a reaction against serialism, for Goeyvaerts both techniques were merely subcategories of a non-dynamic, &quot;static music&quot;. Analyses of his early serial compositions (especially the electronic &quot;Nr. 4, met dode tonen&quot; [with dead tones] and &quot;Nr. 5, met zuivere tonen&quot; [with pure tones]) reveal how close the connections actually are. Goeyvaerts died suddenly in 1993 in his home city of Antwerp.

<text>Nameprep is the process of case-folding a string to lowercase and removal of some generally invisible code points before it is suitable to represent a domain name, or other such canonical name. It is used by the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard, using the Unicode standard for NFKC normalization.

Nameprep is defined in RFC 3491, &quot;Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)&quot;, as a profile of stringprep, which is described in RFC 3454, &quot;Preparation of Internationalized Strings (&quot;stringprep&quot;)&quot;.

It does not map lookalike characters to a single character nor prohibit the use of lookalike characters. There are good reasons for this, such as the fact that same sets of characters may be lookalikes in some fonts but not in others, and the fact that any decision on which character to map to will obviously provide a bias towards users of one script; but it also has potentially grave implications for security if not considered by the designers and administrators of systems based on nameprep (the best known example of this being VeriSign&#x27;s handling of IDNA names in .com and .net).

<text>Alda Ferreira Pires Barreto de Lara Albuquerque, known as Alda Lara (9 June 1930, Benguela, Angola – 30 January 1962, Cambambe, Angola) was a Portuguese-language Angolan poet.

==Early life and education==
Alda Lara was born on 9 June 1930 in Benguela, Portuguese Angola. She came from a wealthy family and received a Christian education, which gave her a spirit of liberalism according to one commentator. Her brother was the noted poet Ernesto Lara Filho. Lara attended a women&#x27;s school in Sá da Bandeira (now Lubango) before moving to Portugal to finish her secondary schooling. She attended University of Lisbon and resided at the Casa dos Estudantes do Império (House of the Students of the Empire). She had an active student life and began her writing career by publishing poetry in the literary journal &quot;Mensagem&quot;, a publication specifically for Africans. Lara later attended the University of Coimbra and earned a degree in medicine.

==Career==
Lara wrote for several newspapers and magazines such as the &quot;Jornal de Benguela&quot;, the &quot;Jornal de Angola&quot;, and the &quot;ABC e Ciência&quot;. She married the Mozambican-Portuguese writer Orlando Albuquerque and gave birth to four children. After living in Portugal for 13 years, Lara moved back to Angola in 1961. 

==Death and legacy==
She died on 30 January 1962 in Cambambe. 

Her husband set about publishing her collected works after her death, including &quot;Poemas&quot; in 1966 and &quot;Tempo de Chuva&quot; in 1973. Lara&#x27;s poems and short stories mostly deal with themes of motherhood and children as well as liberty and justice. Much of her poetry reflect a dissatisfaction with the colonial status quo.

The Alda Lara Prize (in Portuguese, &quot;Prémio Alda Lara&quot;) was established in her honour by the city of Lubango. Paulo de Carvalho, a famed Portuguese singer, who has had a strong artistic career, recorded &quot;Preludio/Mãe Negra&quot;, a poem written by Alda Lara. &quot;Movimento&quot;, the second album of Aline Frazão released in 2013, features a poem by Lara set to music.

==Books (posthumous)==
* &quot;Poemas&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Tempo da Chuva&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Poesia&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Poemas&quot; (1984) (her collected poems)

<doc id="1151257" wikidata="Q540389" url="?curid=1151257" title="Jon Brion">
<text>Jon Brion (born December 11, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and composer. He performed with the Excerpts, the Bats, &#x27;Til Tuesday and the Grays before becoming an established producer and film score composer. 

Brion has produced music for artists and bands including Of Montreal, Aimee Mann, Love Jones, Eels, Fiona Apple, Elliott Smith, Robyn Hitchcock, Rhett Miller, The Crystal Method, Kanye West, Sky Ferreira and Mac Miller. According to &quot;Stereogum,&quot; Brion&#x27;s work on Mann&#x27;s first solo albums &quot;lay the groundwork for a sound that became synonymous with a strain of notable alternative acts at the turn of the century&quot;.

Brion&#x27;s film scores include &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002), &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; and &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (both 2004), &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), &quot;ParaNorman&quot; (2012), &quot;Lady Bird&quot; (2017), and &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; (2018). He released his debut solo album, &quot;Meaningless&quot;, in 2001.

==Early life==
Brion was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, on December 11, 1963. He comes from a musical family; his mother, LaRue, was a singer and administrative assistant, and his father, Keith Brion, was a band director at Yale. His brother and sister became a composer/arranger and a violinist, respectively. Brion grew up in Connecticut, where he dropped out of Hamden High School at the age of 17, opting instead to play music professionally. From 1980 to 1985 Jon was part of the band The Excerpts, along with Stephen Harris, Dean Falcone, Jim Balga, Bobby Butcher &amp; Spike Priggen.

==Career==
===The Bats===
In the early 1980s, Brion and musician/producer Bill Murphy began a writing collaboration in New Haven, Connecticut. They eventually enlisted bassist Don &quot;Riff&quot; Fertman and together formed the Bats (not to be confused with the New Zealand group or South African group of the same name). The Bats released a single, &quot;Popgun&quot;, and one album, &quot;How Pop Can You Get?&quot;, on Gustav Records in 1982. The recordings had much critical acclaim, but little commercial success, and the trio eventually disbanded.

===Session work===
In 1987, Brion moved to Boston, where he played solo gigs, formed the short-lived band World&#x27;s Fair and became a member of the last touring version of Aimee Mann&#x27;s new wave band &#x27;Til Tuesday. He contributed guitar work to Jellyfish&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Spilt Milk&quot;, and in 1994, joined Dan McCarroll, Buddy Judge and ex-Jellyfish guitarist Jason Falkner in the short-lived pop band the Grays. He also played guitar on the Wallflowers&#x27; hit song &quot;One Headlight&quot;, using a screwdriver that was sitting atop a nearby amp as a slide. Brion played numerous instruments on Sam Phillips&#x27; 1996 release &quot;Omnipop&quot;. Brion is featured as keyboardist and drummer on Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Kissin Time&quot;, and co-wrote a song, &quot;City of Quartz&quot;, for her next work, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Before the Poison&quot;.

===Production===
After being recognized as an accomplished session player, Brion branched out into production on then-girlfriend Mann&#x27;s 1993 solo debut, &quot;Whatever&quot;, and its follow-up, &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot;. He has also produced albums by Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, Eleni Mandell, Rhett Miller, Robyn Hitchcock, Brad Mehldau and Evan Dando, and co-produced Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Late Registration&quot; in 2005.

In the fall of 2002, Brion began producing the album &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot; with Fiona Apple, but she later brought in producers Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew (a friend of Brion&#x27;s) to complete the album. Brion&#x27;s versions leaked onto the Internet, where the album gained a cult following long before its official release.

Brion worked and performed on some of the tracks for Sean Lennon&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. Lennon said that working with him was &quot;how I would imagine it&#x27;s like to work with Prince. It&#x27;s like having a weird alien prodigy in your room.&quot;

Brion has produced recordings by British pop performer Dido, Spoon, and Keane, as well as 2010&#x27;s &quot;False Priest&quot; by Of Montreal. Brion also produced Best Coast&#x27;s second album which was released in early 2012. Brion worked on rapper Mac Miller&#x27;s album &quot;Swimming&quot; (2018), and completed production on Miller&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Circles&quot; (2020).

According to &quot;Stereogum,&quot; Brion&#x27;s work on Aimee Mann&#x27;s first solo albums &quot;lay the groundwork for a sound that became synonymous with a strain of notable alternative acts at the turn of the century&quot;.

===&quot;Meaningless&quot;===
Brion was signed to the Lava/Atlantic label in 1997, but was released from his contract after turning in his solo debut album &quot;Meaningless&quot;; the album was released independently in 2001. In 2022, the album was remastered and re-released through Jealous Butcher Records, with Brion&#x27;s approval.

Although, rumors persist about Brion working on a second solo full-length album, as of 2023, an album has not been forthcoming. In 2004, Aimee Mann stated &quot;Jon has at least 10 albums&#x27; worth of material,&quot; and &quot;I think he has a hard time saying anything is finished whether he&#x27;s producing or doing his own songs. Jon&#x27;s a perfectionist.&quot;

===Film scores===
Brion is an accomplished film composer, having started scoring by frequently working with director Paul Thomas Anderson, with whom he has a preferential working relationship. In addition to scoring many of his films, Brion contributed music to &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and had a cameo in the film as a moustached guitar player.

Particularly in his film soundtracks, Brion is noted for his use of early analog sampling instruments, particularly the Chamberlin and Optigan, to create near-realistic emulations of certain instruments.

He has earned Best Score Soundtrack Album Grammy nominations for his work on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Magnolia&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;.

Brion was hired at the last minute to write the incidental music for &quot;The Break-Up&quot;. He has also scored and provided original music for &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (with Chris Thile), &quot;ParaNorman&quot;, &quot;The Future&quot;, &quot;Synecdoche, New York,&quot; Greta Gerwig&#x27;s &quot;Lady Bird&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; (with Geoff Zanelli). He also did live composition for a musical commentary on the &quot;Step Brothers&quot; DVD.

He also composed the score to the Disney/Pixar short film, &quot;The Blue Umbrella&quot;, working alongside Sarah Jaffe.

==Touring and live performances==
Brion is renowned for his regular Friday-night gigs at the Los Angeles club Largo, which feature covers and original songs, a variety of instruments and occasional guest musicians and comedians. He works without a set list, instead using audience suggestions as a jumping-off point. He uses a &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; approach to performing songs, and uses looping systems to record himself starting often with drums, then adding piano, bass, guitar, and vocals. Over the years, shows have featured spontaneous appearances with Jackson Browne, Gillian Welch, Fiona Apple, Rickie Lee Jones with upright bassist Stephen Patt (ex-The Chambers Brothers), Aimee Mann, Elliott Smith, Ben Folds, Nels Cline, percussionist Matt Chamberlain, Tori Amos, bassist Sebastian Steinberg (ex-Soul Coughing), and fiddler Sara Watkins (Nickel Creek).

In April 2006, recurring tendonitis in Brion&#x27;s right hand forced him to cancel all of his upcoming Largo shows. As a temporary &#x27;farewell&#x27;, he played one show only using his left hand, even looping his songs as he normally does and playing the drums with one stick. He resumed playing at Largo on a regular weekly basis later that year, transitioning to a monthly show in 2016, until the COVID-19 Pandemic. In summer 2023, Brion stated to Largo at the Coronet that he intended to resume shows in the near future. Brion resumed shows at Largo in September 2023.

Recalling his approach to the Largo shows with &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; music editor Lou Carlozo, Brion said: &quot;I taught my hands to follow whatever was coming into my head—and wherever my consciousness would go, I had to push my hands to follow. And at some level, you just had to abandon any concern about how you&#x27;d look. Performing without a set list: That was special.&quot;

In March 2016, Brion performed his score for &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; with Wordless Music Orchestra in both Los Angeles and New York City, at the Ace Hotel and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, respectively. Norah Jones provided guest vocals in New York and Joanna Newsom in Los Angeles.

In February 2018, Brion opened for John Mulaney as part of Mulaney&#x27;s special, &quot;Kid Gorgeous&quot;. Brion performed during Mulaney&#x27;s New York City leg of his tour, playing classic rock songs on Radio City&#x27;s Mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ.

== Personal life ==
Brion lives and works in Los Angeles.

Brion had relationships with Aimee Mann during the late 1980s-early 1990s and with Mary Lynn Rajskub from 1997 to 2002.

<text>Robert Nicholas McDonell (born February 18, 1984) is an American writer who has worked as a journalist, screenwriter, producer, novelist and researcher.

==Personal life==
McDonell was born in 1984 in New York City and raised there. McDonell attended the Buckley School, the Riverdale Country School, and graduated from Harvard College in January 2007. In June 2012, he received a graduate degree in International Relations from Oxford University.

His mother, Joanie, is a writer, and his father, Terry McDonell, is managing editor of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. His brother is actor Thomas McDonell. His father was once managing editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where Hunter S. Thompson was a contributing editor and a friend; Thompson gave a blurb to McDonell when &quot;Twelve&quot; was published, as did writers Richard Price and Joan Didion, both personal friends of the family. Morgan Entrekin, president and publisher of Grove/Atlantic, which published the book, is also a friend of the family.

==Works==
===&quot;Twelve&quot;===
McDonell wrote the novel &quot;Twelve&quot; in 2002, when he was 17. The subject of the novel is disaffection, despair, drug use and violence among a group of wealthy Manhattan teenagers during Winter break. The publication of the novel at such a young age was the subject of many articles in high-profile publications such &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Twelve&quot; has been translated into over twenty languages, was on all major American best-seller lists, UK bestseller lists and was number one on German bestseller lists. A motion picture adaptation of the same name was released in 2010. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher and starred Kiefer Sutherland and Chace Crawford.

===&quot;The Third Brother&quot;===
Also published in the UK and translated into many languages, Nick McDonell&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Third Brother&quot; (), was released in September 2005. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a haunting tale of brotherly love.&quot;

Divided into three parts the first describes the 19-year-old protagonist Mike on a revelatory assignment in Bangkok. Mike is working for an old friend of his father. (McDonell himself interned for Karl Taro Greenfeld of &quot;Time Asia&quot;. Greenfeld later worked for McDonell&#x27;s father at &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.)
The second part of the novel takes place on September 11, 2001, as Mike searches for his brother; in the final part Mike returns to college after tragedy strikes his family.

===&quot;Guerre a Harvard&quot;===
Published by Flammarion in 2008, this work recorded the reactions of university students from 2003 to 2008 to the Iraq War involving American armed forces.

===&quot;An Expensive Education&quot;===

With the publication in August 2009 of his third novel, &quot;An Expensive Education&quot;, reviewers compared McDonell to both Graham Greene and John le Carré. Amazon.com recommended the novel and all three of McDonell&#x27;s books were praised in a profile which appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on August 2, 2009. The review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on August 12, 2009, said: &quot;Now 25, McDonell has reached an age at which it is not so freakish to write a good book which is fortunate because he has done it again.&quot; The review goes on to say, &quot;As he&#x27;s shown in his previous novels he can be a ruthless chronicler of America&#x27;s aristocratic culture.&quot; And: &quot;One of the fascinations of this novel is how effectively it tracks distant events that resonate with one another around the world.&quot;

===&quot;The End of Major Combat Operations&quot;===

Published in April 2010, McDonell&#x27;s fourth book reports about the war in Iraq.

===&quot;Green on Blue&quot;===

A TIME e-book published in 2013 about the war in Afghanistan and numerous stark instances of American military casualties there. It was described as being reminiscent of Sebastian Junger and Jim Frederick.

===&quot;White City&quot;===

AMC, the cable television network, decided in 2015 to cancel production of this proposed television series from McDonell, Stephen Gaghan, Tom Freston, and John Dempsey. The AMC series was planned to be a fictional television series about expats in the capital city Kabul, Afghanistan during times of foreign military activity in the region based on McDonell and Dempsey&#x27;s own experiences. McDonell was credited as a screenwriter and producer on this proposed television series. &quot;White City&quot; was already used as the name for other Hollywood projects in the past so the title of the series was deemed too confusing to television and film audiences. &quot;White City&quot; did not move forward because network executives viewed it as being too similar to concurrent Hollywood projects like the hit Showtime premium cable series &quot;Homeland&quot;, the popular FX cable series &quot;Tyrant&quot;, and NBC series &quot;State of Affairs&quot;. A lack of star power among the cast appearing in the pilot led to production being shut down without any episodes airing.

===&quot;The Civilization of Perpetual Movement: Nomadism in World Politics&quot;===

Arriving in April 2016, McDonell&#x27;s book published by Hurst in the UK is a work of non-fiction examining the experiences of nomads in remote locations from Africa to Asia. McDonell has spent years researching and studying such peoples to understand their circumstances. He traveled all around the world for research to rural locations in developing countries such as the Rift Valley, Afghanistan and more.

===&quot;The Bodies in Person&quot;===

Published by Blue Rider Press in 2018, &quot;The Bodies in Person&quot; is subtitled &quot;An Account of Civilian Casualties in American Wars&quot; and has been written from many hours of oral history interviews with soldiers and others involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

=== &quot;The Council of Animals&quot; ===
A short illustrated book about wild animals deciding the fate of humans in the face of climate change, &quot;The Council of Animals&quot; was published by Henry Holt and Co. in 2021.

==Praise==
New York Times book critic and Pulitzer Prize winner Michiko Kakutani described McDonell&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Twelve&quot; as being &quot;As fast as speed, as relentless as acid.&quot; Referring to his second book, Jennifer Egan in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote, &quot;In &quot;The Third Brother&quot;, McDonell delivers another remarkable novel.&quot; The first pre-publication review of McDonell&#x27;s third novel &quot;An Expensive Education&quot;, appeared in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; where it was compared to &quot;le Carré&#x27;s better works.&quot;

McDonell has also been acclaimed for his book &quot;La Guerre a Harvard&quot; published in France in 2009, and articles from Darfur for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; 2009, and for &quot;Time&quot; from Iraq.

<text>Harriman State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of New York. Located in Rockland and Orange counties north of New York City, it the state&#x27;s second largest, and features 31 lakes, multiple streams, public camping area, and great vistas. Its over of trails are a haven for hikers, currently maintained by volunteers from the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference.

On its northeastern edge, Harriman State Park borders the Bear Mountain State Park and the United States Military Academy&#x27;s forest reserve. To the southwest, it partly borders the state-owned Sterling Forest reserve. Together with the state&#x27;s Storm King, these contiguous protected forests are almost as large as Harriman alone.

==History==
Edward Harriman and Mary Averell Harriman owned in Arden, New York as part of their estate. They opposed the state&#x27;s decision to build a prison at Bear Mountain and wanted to donate some of their land to the state in order to build a park. A year after the death of her husband in 1909, Mary Harriman proposed to Governor Charles Evans Hughes that she would donate of land and $1 million for the creation of a new state park. As part of the deal, the state would do away with the plan to build the prison, appropriate an additional $2.5 million to acquire additional land and construct park facilities. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission would have its authority extended north into the Ramapo Mountains and the Hudson Highlands, and New Jersey would also contribute an amount of money deemed reasonable by the Commission. The state agreed and on October 29, 1910, Harriman&#x27;s son W. Averell Harriman presented a deed for the land and a million-dollar check to the Commission.
In 1913, Major William A. Welch started construction on the road from Bear Mountain to Sloatsburg, known today as the Seven Lakes Drive. In 1962 a new road from the Southfields section of Tuxedo to Kanawake Circle was opened. There were also numerous other roads completed around Bear Mountain and Dunderberg Mountain in order to make it easier for people to reach the new park. In addition, there was steamboat service from Manhattan offering round-trip tickets for 85 cents for adults and 45 cents for children.

The park received a large influx of free labor during the Great Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) offered thousands of young men work such as building roads, trails, camps and lakes. Projects completed by the CCC in the park included Pine Meadow, Wanoksink, Turkey Hill, Welch, Silvermine and Massawippa Lakes. In 1974, Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 6231 crashed in the park. In 1993, the World Orienteering Championships were held at Harriman State Park.

==Trails==
There are more than forty marked hiking trails ( total) in Harriman, and another 57 unmarked trails and woods road (, foot traffic &quot;only&quot;). Some of the better known trails include the following:

In addition to the hiking trails there are a number of horse trails in the southeastern portion of the park and a mountain bike trail at the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area in the northeast of the park. In winter some of the trails are open for cross-country skiing. The hiking trails are maintained by the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference.

<text>Styx II is the second album by American band Styx, released in July 1973.

==Background==
After releasing their debut album, which consisted mostly of cover songs, the band intended to write some strong original new material; Dennis DeYoung was particularly in favor of this. DeYoung had written a song by himself on an electric piano in the band&#x27;s garage, and had originally intended for it to be on the first album. He later decided to play it on an acoustic piano. However, Bill Traut wanted to save it for the second album. The result was &quot;Lady&quot;, written about DeYoung&#x27;s wife Suzanne.

&quot;Lady&quot; failed to be a hit when it was first released in 1973; however, after the band released their fourth album &quot;Man of Miracles&quot; in 1974, they went to WLS, the most powerful Chicago radio station at the time, and convinced the program director (Jim Smith) to replay this song. It wound up being played frequently on the air in Chicago. In May 1975, the song broke out nationally, eventually peaking at no. 6 on the Billboard charts.

Besides &quot;Lady,&quot; the album contained some upbeat and prog rock songs, such as the rockers &quot;You Need Love&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Feel It,&quot; which were written by DeYoung and sung by James &quot;JY&quot; Young.

This is also the first album on which John Curulewski wrote and sang on two songs: the proggish, jazzy &quot;A Day,&quot; which has an unusual sound for the band, and the boogie humor song &quot;You Better Ask,&quot; whose outro features a snippet of &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; on calliope organ and an evil laugh.

Side 2 opens with a DeYoung rendition of &quot;Little Fugue in G&quot; by Bach, played on pipe organ at a Chicago Cathedral, and segues into the mellow prog rocker &quot;Father O.S.A.&quot; 

The rocker &quot;Earl of Roseland&quot; was written by DeYoung based on early memories from when he grew up in Chicago&#x27;s Roseland neighborhood, where he had formed the band with the Panozzo brothers.

After Styx moved to A&amp;M Records and achieved national success in the US, &quot;Styx II&quot; went Gold shortly before the success of &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977) and became the only big-selling album from the Wooden Nickel era, because of &quot;Lady.&quot; The album was reissued in 1980 by their prior label, Wooden Nickel. Under the title Lady, the reissue had new artwork (though it is not to be confused with a Styx compilation album that was later released with the same name). Until the release of &quot;Crash of the Crown&quot; in 2021 it was the only Styx album to not feature material written or co-written by Young (apart from their covers 2005 album, &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot;).

<text>Paulina &quot;Poulli&quot; Chiziane (born 4 June 1955, Manjacaze, southern province of Gaza, Mozambique) is an author of novels and short stories in the Portuguese language. She was awarded the 2021 Camões Prize for literature, awarded to writers from Portuguese-speaking countries.

==Early life==
She studied at Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo. She was born to a Protestant family that moved from Gaza to the capital Maputo (then Lourenço Marques) during the writer&#x27;s early childhood. At home she spoke Chopi and Ronga.

==Writing==
Chiziane was the first woman in Mozambique to publish a novel. Her writing has generated some polemical discussions about social issues, such as the practice of polygamy in the country. For example, her first novel, &quot;Balada do Amor ao Vento&quot; (1990), discusses polygamy in southern Mozambique during the colonial period. Related to her active involvement in the politics of Frelimo (Liberation Front of Mozambique), her narrative often reflects the social uneasiness of a country ravaged and divided by the war of liberation and the civil conflicts that followed independence. Her novel &quot;Niketche: Uma História de Poligamia&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The First Wife: A Tale of Polygamy&quot;) won the José Craveirinha Prize in 2003.

== Interpretation ==

Chiziane&#x27;s writing has often been defined as political and feminist. Writing for this author is a mission. It is a way to express the difficulties that women encounter when faced with the heterogeneity of Mozambican cultural traditions and the newly developed legal and administrative systems. Chiziane&#x27;s writing addresses regional differences in cultural and political aspects of gender relations. In her novel &quot;Niketche&quot;, for instance, she depicts the Mozambican South as dominated by a patriarchal culture, whereas the North is shaped by traditions of matriarchal rule. She also alludes to the fact that Frelimo itself assumed an ambiguous attitude with regard to polygamy, making it illegal at first, but then tolerating its continuing practice. Throughout her work, Chiziane&#x27;s attention has focused on broad social issues related to women&#x27;s rights and concerns, such as monogamy and polygamy, but also on subjective and intimate relationships between individual men and women. Chiziane has stated that, in accordance with the tradition of her land, she considers herself a storyteller rather than a novelist.

In 2016, she announced that she was retiring from writing.

<text>The &#x27; (, , abbr. &#x27;) is the Austrian member of the Eurosystem and was the monetary authority for Austria from 1923 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1998, issuing the Austrian schilling. 

It started operations on under the economic assistance provided to Austria by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, replacing the Austro-Hungarian Bank with its name recalling that of the Austro-Hungarian Bank&#x27;s predecessor entity founded in 1816. It was liquidated following the Anschluss in March 1938, and re-established in July 1945.

The OeNB is a joint-stock corporation governed by special legislative provision. Its entire capital of €12 million has been held by the Austrian federal government since May 2010, with shareholder rights exercised by the Minister of Finance. Before 2010, half of the capital was in the hands of employer and employee organizations as well as banks and insurance corporations.

==History==

The Oesterreichische Nationalbank was established under the conditions of the stabilization loan coordinated by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations in 1922–23. The bank&#x27;s statutes were drafted by the League&#x27;s Financial Committee and enacted in Austrian legislation on . The new institution started operations on . It took over the former Austrian-territory branches and operations of the Austro-Hungarian Bank, whose liquidation had been implemented in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed on , and whose Governing Council last met on .

Following the banking crisis of 1931, Austrian National Bank President Viktor Kienböck oversaw an orthodox economic policy paradigm in which he rigorously defended the currency in the face of growing overvaluation. This contributed to a substantial contraction in Austrian GDP. 

Following the Anschluss in 1938, the Austrian National Bank&#x27;s was liquidated, and its shareholders were forced to accept German government bonds in exchange for their shares. Its operations were taken over by the Reichsbank and became the latter&#x27;s Vienna branch, and the Reichsmark became Austria&#x27;s currency by German decree of . The former National Bank&#x27;s gold holdings and foreign currency reserves were moved to Berlin. 

The Oesterreichische Nationalbank was re-established by the Central Bank Transition Act of of the Second Austrian Republic. The Austrian schilling came back to replace the Reichsmark on . Much of the head office building served as headquarters of the American occupation forces in Austria from 1945 to 1951.

==Tasks and composition==

The main tasks of the OeNB center on contributing to a stability-oriented monetary policy within the Eurozone, safeguarding financial stability in Austria and supplying the general public and the business community in Austria with high-quality, i.e. counterfeit-proof, cash. In addition, the OeNB manages reserve assets, i.e. gold and foreign exchange holdings, with a view to backing the euro in times of crisis, draws up economic analyses, compiles statistical data, is active in international organizations and is responsible for payment systems oversight. Furthermore, the OeNB operates a payment system for the euro, promotes knowledge and understanding among the general public and decision makers owing to its comprehensive communication policy, and supports research in Austria.

<text>Sidney George Wilson (born January 20, 1977) is an American DJ and keyboardist. He is the turntablist for the nu metal band Slipknot, in which he is designated #0.

==Biography==
Sid Wilson was born in Des Moines, Iowa. His parents are both from England.

He performs in the American band Slipknot, and also tours as DJ Starscream, a name which is derived from the &quot;Transformers&quot; character of the same name. He is a fan of the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise, and has Transformer tattoos. Musically within Slipknot, Wilson contributes scratching, sound effects, horrorlike noises as well as background noises/effects. When numbers were being assigned to each band member, he insisted on being the number zero since it epitomized filth. He is also known to stage dive in Slipknot&#x27;s early years, and in 2008, he broke both his heels when he jumped ten feet from the stage. 

Outside Slipknot, Wilson has made a following in Japan as a jungle musician, under the pseudonym DJ Starscream, and is currently signed to the Japanese record label N2O Records. He collaborated with The Mad Capsule Markets vocalist Hiroshi Kyono on a song called &quot;HAKAI (Destroy)&quot; released on &quot;The Songs for Death Note the movie～the Last name Tribute～&quot;, a tribute album dedicated to the live action movie for the second &quot;Death Note&quot; film. A remix of the track also appeared on the Wagdug Futuristic Unity mini-album &quot;Nu Riot&quot; and 2008 album &quot;Hakai&quot;.

In August 2010, he toured with his solo band Sid of which he is the lead vocalist. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sid&quot; was released on September 13, 2011, via digital download. In 2013 he was a support act for Vamps at their shows in Los Angeles and New York.

==Mask==
During his time with Slipknot, Wilson&#x27;s mask has been, for the most part, based on gas masks. His first mask worn for the release of Slipknot was a British Civil Duty gas mask, which had been customized with the front filter being removed, as well as the glass lenses. It has become synonymous with the DJ ever since he adopted it in 1999. During the tour for &quot;Iowa&quot;, he wore gas masks that had been customized to resemble skulls. During &quot;the Subliminal Verses World Tour&quot;, Wilson grew his hair long and began to wear various masks that simply resembled skulls, shying away from the gas-mask concept. In promotional photos for &quot;All Hope is Gone&quot; and the tour for the album, Wilson changed his mask once again, this time, to resemble a robot, dedicated also for his love of the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. Later, he once again cut his hair short, this time into a Fauxhawk style, and dyed it red. The eyebrows of the mask are able to be animatronically controlled, allowing him to make various expressions.
After the death of bassist Paul Gray in 2010, and during the subsequent &quot;Memorial World Tour&quot;, Wilson, in keeping with the rest of the band, reverted to his old mask and red jump suit, worn during the self-titled album tour, as a tribute to Gray.

In 2013, Wilson announced a new mask which he debuted over the weekend at Ozzfest Japan in Tokyo. The mask was made by Ukrainian design studio Bob Basset. This and the subsequent masks made by Basset are all made of leather and have a style reminiscent of his earlier gas masks. The music video for Slipknot&#x27;s single &quot;The Devil in I&quot; from their 2014 album &quot;.5: The Gray Chapter&quot;, features a mask with circular eye holes similar to those from his Iowa era mask, however these are covered by metal grills that resemble spatulas. The mask also has a removable metal plate that can be placed over the mouth, in which he has a sharp golden grill. Wilson&#x27;s mask was drastically changed once again for the release of Slipknot&#x27;s sixth album &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;, becoming an animatronic death mask of his own face, covered partly by a large black hood and robe. This mask drew significant attention, though mostly positive, for being a drastic leap from the designs of any previous Slipknot masks and for being reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine or a slasher villain.Additionally, Sid is also responsible for designing other members&#x27; original masks, such as Craig&#x27;s Helmet, creating Chris Fehn&#x27;s liar mask and Jim Root&#x27;s jester mask.

==Personal life==
Wilson met Kelly Osbourne at 1999&#x27;s Ozzfest and they quickly became very good friends. The two were confirmed to be in a romantic relationship not long after Wilson&#x27;s 45th birthday in 2022. They had a son together in late 2022.

<doc id="1151316" wikidata="Q23016621" url="?curid=1151316" title="Cosina">
<text>is a manufacturer of high-end optical glass, optical precision equipment, cameras, video and electronic related equipment, based in Nakano, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.

==History==
Cosina is the successor to Nikō (or &quot;Nikoh&quot;), a company set up as a lens processing factory in February 1959, which was a pioneer in optical polishing and lens grinding in Japan. In 1966, it also started to manufacture 35 mm compact cameras and 8 mm cine cameras, and a year later started the manufacture of 35mm film SLR cameras; in 1968 it started a glass melting factory. Nikō changed its name to Cosina in 1973. (The first part of the name is a reference to the Koshi area within Nakano, where the founder came from; while the &#x27;Na&#x27; represents Nakano.)

The name Cosina has previously appeared on compact and SLR cameras for 135 film. The CS-2 and CS-3 SLRs were introduced in 1978, followed in 1980 by the CT-1, CT-7 (the world&#x27;s first all—push-button SLR), CT-10 and CT-20, the CT-1G in 1982 and the CT-9 in 1986. Cosina SLR cameras used either the M42 (Praktica/Pentax) lens mount or the Pentax K (bayonet) lens mount. However, Cosina is probably better known as a manufacturer of cameras and camera components for other brands, including the popular Yashica FX-3, FX-3 Super, and Super 2000. During the late 1970s, Cosina made a name for itself in 35 mm rangefinder cameras with a well-built, high quality fixed-lens camera using an aluminum body and a simple shutter-priority autoexposure system. This rangefinder camera was adopted as the basic chassis for several excellent camera models, including the Minolta 7SII, Revue 400 SE, Prinz 35 ER, and Vivitar 35 ES.

In 1982, Cosina began to manufacture lenses in a variety of SLR manufacturers&#x27; lens mounts. In 1991, it started to produce glass molded aspheric lenses, and in 1996 plastic molded aspherical lenses. Cosina began producing digital cameras in 1997.

===Voigtländer brand acquisition===
At about this time, plans were started to produce a new high-quality rangefinder 35 mm film camera, complete with wide and ultrawide lenses for the Leica screw mount, and also a standard 35 mm film camera for the amateur film photography sector — similar to a rangefinder camera, but without a rangefinder or viewfinder — for mounting these lenses.

In 1999, Cosina secured partial rights to the German, once Austrian, classic camera brand &quot;Voigtländer&quot;, acquired from &quot;RINGFOTO GmbH &amp; Co. ALFO Marketing KG&quot; in Germany, to produce the &quot;Classic Collection&quot; (high-quality lenses with both M39 screw thread and Leica M bayonet, 35mm film cameras Bessa R, Bessa L, Bessa T, and medium format cameras Bessa III). Cosina first introduced the Voigtländer 15 mm f/4.5 and 25 mm f/4 lens (neither of them rangefinder-coupled) and the Voigtländer Bessa-L standard camera body. It quickly followed with a wider range of Voigtländer cameras (starting with the Bessa-R, with viewfinder and rangefinder, and the Bessa-T, with rangefinder, but no viewfinder), and a set of lenses, including the Heliar 12 mm f/5.6 lens, which on its introduction was the widest rectilinear lens ever marketed for still photography.

On April 26, 2010, Cosina joined the Micro Four Thirds System Standard Group.

In 2016, Cosina manufactured a &quot;Nokton&quot; 1,4/ 58 mm after 2003 a second time. For this lenses a Topcon-construction was used.

==Voigtländer==
Cosina&#x27;s &quot;Voigtländer&quot; products are sometimes referred to as Cosina Voigtländer.

The Cosina Voigtländer cameras and lenses have been of great personal interest to ( 1953), the President of Cosina since the death in 1988 of his father , the founder. The name Cosina now appears (conspicuously) on lenses for various SLR mounts, and less conspicuously on a widening range of cameras and lenses with the Voigtländer brand. Cosina manufactured the rangefinder camera Rollei 35 RF for Rollei Fototechnic, and is acknowledged to have manufactured (and to have helped design) the Epson digital rangefinder camera R-D1 as well. Its manufacture of a new Zeiss Ikon rangefinder camera with Leica M-mount, and Zeiss lenses in Leica bayonet mount, was announced in October 2004, and had begun producing these by April 2006. All these cameras use film.

==Other manufacturers==
===Cameras===
Cosina is also well known for manufacturing 35 mm SLR cameras to the specifications of other manufacturers and distributors, such as the Canon T60, the Nikon FM10 and FE10, the Olympus OM2000, Konica TC-X, Yashica FX-3 and FX-3 Super, and various Vivitar models. For this models the CT-1 was used.

A Cosina design, the 1982 Cosina CX-2, was copied by the Russian optical firm LOMO as the popular Lomo LC-A.

===Lenses===
Cosina manufactures manual focus SLR lenses for Carl Zeiss AG with: Leica (ZM), Nikon (ZF), Pentax (ZK), Canon EOS (ZE), and M42 (ZS) lens screw mounts.

<text>In mathematics, a Thue equation is a Diophantine equation of the form

formula_1

where formula_2 is an irreducible bivariate form of degree at least 3 over the rational numbers, and formula_3 is a nonzero rational number. It is named after Axel Thue, who in 1909 proved that a Thue equation can have only finitely many solutions in integers formula_4 and formula_5, a result known as Thue&#x27;s theorem.

The Thue equation is solvable effectively: there is an explicit bound on the solutions formula_4, formula_5 of the form formula_8 where constants formula_9 and formula_10 depend only on the form formula_2. A stronger result holds: if formula_12 is the field generated by the roots of formula_2, then the equation has only finitely many solutions with formula_4 and formula_5 integers of formula_12, and again these may be effectively determined.

==Finiteness of solutions and diophantine approximation==
Thue&#x27;s original proof that the equation named in his honour has finitely many solutions is through the proof of what is now known as Thue&#x27;s theorem: it asserts that for any algebraic number formula_17 having degree formula_18 and for any formula_19 there exists only finitely many coprime integers formula_20 with formula_21 such that formula_22. Applying this theorem allows one to almost immediately deduce the finiteness of solutions. However, Thue&#x27;s proof, as well as subsequent improvements by Siegel, Dyson, and Roth were all ineffective.

==Solution algorithm==
Finding all solutions to a Thue equation can be achieved by a practical algorithm, which has been implemented in the following computer algebra systems:
* in PARI/GP as functions &quot;thueinit()&quot; and &quot;thue()&quot;.
* in Magma as functions &quot;ThueObject()&quot; and &quot;ThueSolve()&quot;.
* in Mathematica through &quot;Reduce[]&quot;
* in Maple through &quot;ThueSolve()&quot;

==Bounding the number of solutions==

While there are several effective methods to solve Thue equations (including using Baker&#x27;s method and Skolem&#x27;s &quot;p&quot;-adic method), these are not able to give the best theoretical bounds on the number of solutions. One may qualify an effective bound formula_23 of the Thue equation formula_24 by the parameters it depends on, and how &quot;good&quot; the dependence is. 

The best result known today, essentially building on pioneering work of Bombieri and Schmidt, gives a bound of the shape formula_25, where formula_26 is an &quot;absolute constant&quot; (that is, independent of both formula_2 and formula_3) and formula_29 is the number of distinct prime factors of formula_3. The most significant qualitative improvement to the theorem of Bombieri and Schmidt is due to Stewart, who obtained a bound of the form formula_31 where formula_32 is a divisor of formula_3 exceeding formula_34 in absolute value. It is conjectured that one may take the bound formula_35; that is, depending only on the &quot;degree&quot; of formula_2 but not its coefficients, and completely independent of the integer formula_3 on the right hand side of the equation. 

This is a weaker form of a conjecture of Stewart, and is a special case of the uniform boundedness conjecture for rational points. This conjecture has been proven for &quot;small&quot; integers formula_3, where smallness is measured in terms of the discriminant of the form formula_2, by various authors, including Evertse, Stewart, and Akhtari. Stewart and Xiao demonstrated a strong form of this conjecture, asserting that the number of solutions is absolutely bounded, holds on average (as formula_3 ranges over the interval formula_41 with formula_42).

<text>Rooty Hill is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Rooty Hill is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.

==History==

=== Pre-colonial (Aboriginal) era ===
Rooty Hill was broadly inhabited by the Darug people before European settlement. 

=== Colonial era ===
The earliest exploration of the area was led by Captain Watkin Tench in 1789. The origin of this name puzzled historians for many years because the clue lay not in Blacktown City but on Norfolk Island. Governor Philip Gidley King had been in charge of the first settlement there in early 1788 and had noted that the hillside where he had built his Government House had been difficult to dig owing to the amount of tree roots beneath the surface. The hill on Norfolk became known as Rooty Hill and the name is now official. When King returned to New South Wales he built the headquarters for his government reserve of 1802 at the foot of a hill that reminded him of the Norfolk Island Rooty Hill and used the same name. The name Rooty Hill first appeared on a map in 1803.

The early development of the area came when Captain William Minchin was given a grant of in 1819, leading to the development of the Minchinbury estate. Dr Charles McKay purchased the estate in 1859 and subdivided it in the 1880s. Afterwards, the Watts family built Watts Cottage in Watt Street. It combines Italianate elements with a bullnose verandah and is almost unique in the Blacktown Municipality. It is locally heritage-listed.

In 1890, the Imperial Hotel was built north of the railway station by F.J. Weston. It was intended to cater for the crowds who attended the greyhound racing at Lamb&#x27;s Woodstock Coursing Track at Plumpton. By the early 1970s it had become semi-derelict, but was acquired by a local dentist in 1977. It reopened in 1982 and is now state heritage-listed.

In 1891, the Pioneer Memorial Church, located on Rooty Hill Road South, was built on land donated by Dr Charles McKay. It was originally a Baptist church, but was later acquired for the Presbyterian community by James Angus, owner of the Minchinbury estate from 1895. It is still in use and is locally heritage-listed.

=== Post federation ===
In 1902–1903, the School of Arts, located in Rooty Hill Road South, was built by the residents for community activities. The foundation stone was laid 1 November 1902, by Miss Angus, daughter of James Angus. It is locally heritage-listed.

On 13 April 1916, James Angus was killed at Rooty Hill railway crossing, as a result of being hit by that morning&#x27;s express train. He was survived by his wife, his son James (of Adelaide), his son John (a pastoralist in New South Wales) and his daughter, who by that time was the widow Mrs Fleming.

The name of James Angus is preserved in Angus Avenue; Charles McKay&#x27;s name survives in Dr Charles McKay Reserve; the name of the Evans family, who built &quot;Fairholme&quot;, survives in Evans Road. &quot;Fairholme&quot;, now part of the St Agnes Catholic High School, is locally heritage-listed.

=== Post war ===
During and following World War II, Australia had realised its demographic crisis in simply not having enough people, exacerbated by the threat of Japanese invasion. In response, Australia allowed immigration from more and more nations as previously restricted by the White Australia policy. In 1973, the Whitlam government effectively abolished the White Australia policy, meaning people would not be denied immigration due to their nationality. Notably, this allowed immigrants from Asia to come in, and in the ensuing decades, especially from the 1990s-2010s, many Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis, Polynesians and Chinese immigrants populated Rooty Hill, rendering the suburb in the multicultural state it is in today. 

In 1964, the Rooty Hill RSL (now known as West HQ) was built, and over time turned into the largest licensed club in New South Wales, serving as a hub for entertainment, fitness and lifestyle. Dubbed by some as the &quot;Vegas of the West&quot;, the RSL also has Western Sydney&#x27;s largest gym, five star accommodation and conference facilities. Currently, the RSL has approximately 50,000 members. West HQ also has Sydney Coliseum Theatre, intended to somewhat be &quot;Sydney Opera House of Western Sydney&quot;.

== Heritage listings ==
Rooty Hill has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: Dunsmore Street: Government Depot Site
* Eastern Road: Rooty Hill
* 1 Rooty Hill Road: Imperial Hotel

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census, there were 16,176 people in Rooty Hill, 48.9% of who were male and 51.1% of who were female. The median age was 37, lower than Australia&#x27;s national median of 38. The median weekly income was $2,001, higher than Australia&#x27;s national median of $1,250. The average motor vehicles per dwelling was 1.9.

The most common ancestries were Filipino 21.0%, Australian 14.9% English 13.0%, Indian 8.3% and Pakistani 4.0%. 

*43.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 15.5%, India 5.3%, Pakistan 3.4%, Fiji 2.9% and New Zealand 2.3%. 
*The most common responses for religion were Catholic 33.4%, Islam 12.4%, No religion 12.1% and Hinduism 9.6%.
*40.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tagalog 9.7%, Filipino 5.1%, Urdu 5.0%, Hindi 3.6% and Arabic 2.6%.
Because of Rooty Hill&#x27;s high Filipino population, some refer to it as the Little Manila of Sydney, consolidated by the many Filipino restaurants and businesses. However, some attribute Blacktown City Council as a whole as Little Manila rather than just Rooty Hill.

== Sport and recreation ==

Rooty Hill is home to the multi-sports Blacktown International Sportspark, which includes two cricket grounds (which have also been used for Australian rules football), an athletics track and field, three baseball diamonds, two soccer fields, four softball diamonds, administration centres and park land. It has been used as a training and administrative base for the Greater Western Sydney Giants from 2010 to 2012, and for the Western Sydney Wanderers FC since 2012. Since 2010 the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League have used the main baseball stadium as their home field. There is also a boutique stadium at the facility which hosts National Premier League fixtures for Blacktown Spartans FC. 

Rooty Hill is home to West HQ,where there is a Zone Bowling centre, the Sydney Coliseum Theatre, numerous restaurants, a Novotel location, a gymnastics &amp; aquatics centre and a gym.

Rooty Hill is also home to Rooty Hill Skatepark. It features quarter pipes, various ledges, and a stair handrail.

==Commercial area==
The main commercial area of Rooty Hill is primarily on Rooty Hill Road North and Rooty Hill Road South, surrounding the railway station, especially on Rooty Hill Road North. There is also a significant commercial area on the intersection of North Parade, Sherbrooke Street and Railway Street, where the Sydney Coliseum Theatre can be found.

==Schools==
* Rooty Hill Public School is a New South Wales public school providing education from Kindergarten to Year 6. It has been on Rooty Hill Road North since its opening in 1957 with 114 students. The entire class of the opening year attended the 50th anniversary celebrations held in May 2007. Member for Chifley, Roger Price commented that &quot;..the influence a school can have on a student lasts their lifetime. Having the entire class of 1957 at the (50th anniversary) celebration shows just how positive that can be&quot;.
* St. Aidans Primary School (Kindergarten-Year 6), located in Adelaide Street, was founded in 1907.
* St. Agnes Catholic High School (Years 7–10), Evans Road, Rooty Hill is a secondary school located in Rooty Hill South. Established in 1962, the school is a part of the Christ Catholic College Community of schools which was established in 1999, and which is a system of three schools that broke apart in 2004 - the other two schools being Clare Catholic High School in Hassall Grove, and Loyola Senior High School in Mt Druitt, which is the only Senior High School in the Parramatta Diocese. In late 2004, St Agnes underwent a major building development, with a new building containing six classrooms, a library and an undercroft, which would provide easy access to the school hall. In late 2007, the school underwent a whole-campus redevelopment.
* Rooty Hill High School (Years 7–12). North Parade, Rooty Hill. Rooty Hill High School is a comprehensive, 7 to 12 community school in Western Sydney.

<text>Styx is the debut album by American rock band Styx. It was released in 1972.

==Background==

The band started as a cover band that played weddings and birthday parties. They called themselves The Tradewinds in 1961, when the band was composed of 12-year-old fraternal twins Chuck and John Panozzo, who played bass guitar and drums, respectively, and their neighbor, 14-year-old Dennis DeYoung on keyboards, accordion, and vocals. They later named themselves TW4, after adding their college friend John Curulewski in 1968, and the South Side hard rocker James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young in 1970, as guitarists, songwriters, and singers.
Their debut album showcased them as a progressive-art rock/&#x27;60s garage rock act. It contained the 13-minute opus &quot;Movement for the Common Man,&quot; and J.Y. rocker &quot;Children of the Land.&quot; It also features John Panozzo&#x27;s percussion solo, the street interviews from Chicago &quot;Street Collage,&quot; their symphonic rocker rendition of &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man,&quot; and the prog-folk piece &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Matinee,&quot; sung by DeYoung and co-written by Young &amp; DeYoung. The upbeat pop rocker &quot;Best Thing&quot; was co-written by DeYoung and Young, released as a single in late &#x27;72, and peaked at No. 82 on the charts.
The remaining songs on the album were cover versions that the record label suggested. The band members, including DeYoung, said that they had never heard of them before.

The album was reissued in 1979 under the title Styx I with new artwork. In late 2012, it was re-released for CD and digital download, along with &quot;Styx II&quot; (1973), &quot;The Serpent Is Rising&quot; (1973), and &quot;Man of Miracles&quot; (1974).

<doc id="1151349" wikidata="Q1542836" url="?curid=1151349" title="Wiliwili">
<text>Wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis) is a species of tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is the only species of &quot;Erythrina&quot; that naturally occurs there. It is typically found in Hawaiian tropical dry forests on leeward island slopes up to an elevation of .

&quot;Wiliwili&quot; means &quot;repeatedly twisted&quot; in the Hawaiian language and refers to the seedpods, which dehisce, or twist open, to reveal the seeds.

==Description==
&quot;Wiliwili&quot; trees grow to a height of with a gnarled and stout trunk that reaches in diameter. The bark is smooth, slightly fissured, and covered in gray or black spines up to in length. The bark on the main trunk of mature trees has a distinct orange cast, which is caused by a terrestrial alga.

The &quot;wiliwili&quot; is summer (dry season) drought deciduous. The dry season usually begins in late April or in May, and trees in the wild typically lose all of their leaves before they bloom. Trees in cultivation may retain much of their foliage through blooming time. The flowers appear in the first half of the dry season, from April through July. They form on horizontal or nearly horizontal racemes that are long. The flower color may be orange, yellow, salmon, greenish or whitish. Sometimes all of these colors occur in a single population. The standard petal is erect, not enclosing the other petals. Like all of the erythrinas, the wiliwili is pollinated by birds. The horizontal raceme and the erect standard are adaptations to pollination by passerine birds. Many other erythrinas are pollinated by hummingbirds, which do not occur in Hawaii.

Pods develop and persist on the tree, with the seeds remaining attached long after the pods have opened. The seeds are dislodged by heavy downpours that generally start around November in the islands. Many seeds germinate quickly, and a well-established seedling can grow to in height before the start of the next dry season.

That the &quot;wiliwili&quot; bears spines is unusual for a species that has evolved in the isolated Hawaiian Islands, without the presence of ungulates or other large herbivores. Many plants in the islands have consequently evolved away the protection of spines. The &quot;wiliwili&quot; is thought to be closely related to &quot;E. tahitensis&quot;, a tree endemic to the Tahitian Archipelago, and &quot;E. velutina&quot;, a widespread species found in tropical South America and the Caribbean.

==Distribution==
Wiliwili is occasionally seen in cultivation in Hawaii. It is easily propagated from cuttings. Seven other species of &quot;Erythrina&quot; were under general cultivation in the Hawaiian Islands, but have been mostly extirpated by the alien gall wasp (see Conservation, below). They were popular street trees in dry areas and windbreaks on fields. At least 80 others have been known in botanical gardens there. No non-native species of &quot;Erythrina&quot; is known to be naturalized in Hawaii.

The &quot;wiliwili&quot; is distinguished from the other seven cultivated species by a pod with only one to three red or yellow-orange seeds, which sink in water; non-native &quot;Erythrina&quot; have pods with larger numbers of brown seeds, which float in water.
==Uses==
Native Hawaiians made a number of items from &quot;wiliwili&quot; wood because of its low density, such as &quot;mouo&quot; (fishing net floats), &quot;ama&quot; (outrigger canoe floats, and extremely long &quot;papa hee nalu&quot; (surfboards) called &quot;olo&quot;. &quot;Olo&quot;, which averaged , were exclusively ridden by &quot;alii&quot; (royalty). The wood was sometimes used for the &quot;waa&quot; (hull) of outrigger canoes intended to be used near-shore, for recreation, or for training. The shiny orange-red seeds were strung into &quot;lei&quot;.

==Conservation==
Like many other native species in Hawaii, the wiliwili is threatened by competition with non-native species that are free of the diseases, parasites, and herbivores that constrain them in their original habitats.

It was additionally reported in December 2005 that the Hawaiian &quot;wiliwili&quot; population was under immediate threat due to an infestation by a gall wasp, &quot;Quadrastichus erythrinae&quot;, which had been first reported in Hawaii in April of that year. This invasive species appears to have arrived in Hawaii via southern Taiwan, Singapore and southern China within only two years. This species was not previously known to science and was formally named and described in 2004. It is thought to have originated in Africa, and the means of its rapid dispersal across South Asia, the Pacific, and southern North America is not understood. The majority of trees of introduced &quot;Erythrina&quot; species have died as a result of gall wasp infestation. Native &quot;wiliwili&quot; forests have also been hard hit, particularly Puu o Kali on the island of Maui - prior to 2001, the best remaining example of a Hawai&#x27;i low elevation dryland forest ecosystem. The USGS-Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center study site now documents the destructive impact of two invasive insect species (African bruchid beetle &quot;Specularius impressithorax&quot; and erythrina gall wasp) on &quot;Erythrina sandwicensis&quot;.

A parasitoid wasp, &quot;Eurytoma erythrinae,&quot; was released by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture in December 2008 as a biocontrol to minimize the damaging effects of &quot;Quadrastichus&quot;. &quot;Eurytoma&quot; wasps lay their eggs in the galls created by &quot;Quadrastichus&quot; wasps. &quot;Eurytoma&quot; larvae hatch faster than &quot;Quadrastichus&quot; larvae, on which they exclusively feed. The introduction of &quot;Eurytoma&quot; has reduced the population of &quot;Quadrastichus&quot; to a point where the wiliwili trees no longer die, but still have a much reduced production of viable seeds. That&#x27;s largely because &quot;Eurytoma&quot; larvae need to feed on multiple &quot;Quadrastichus&quot; to complete their development, and egg-laying female &quot;Eurytoma&quot; therefore ignore small isolated galls containing a single larva. The Hawaii Departments of Agriculture and of Land &amp; Natural Resources therefore plan to introduce a second parasitoid wasp from Africa, &quot;Aprostocetus nitens&quot;. The smaller &quot;A. nityens&quot; completes its development feeding from a single &quot;Quadrastichus&quot; larva, and it is therefore expected to complement &quot;Eurytoma&quot; by targeting isolated larvae.

==History==
The genus &quot;Erythrina&quot; was established by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book, &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. The name means &quot;red&quot;, a reference to the flower color of some of the well-known species.

In 1786, in his book &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique: Botanique&quot;, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck originated the name &quot;Erythrina monosperma&quot; for a Leguminous tree from India and Southeast Asia. That tree has been known as &quot;Butea monosperma&quot; ever since William Roxburgh created the genus &quot;Butea&quot; in 1795.

Unaware of Lamarck&#x27;s name, Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré created the name &quot;Erythrina monosperma&quot; for the Hawaiian &quot;Erythrina&quot; in 1830 in his book &quot;Voyage of the Uranus&quot;.

In 1841, William Jackson Hooker and George Arnott used Gaudichaud&#x27;s name in their book, &quot;The Botany of Captain Beechey&#x27;s Voyage&quot;.

Gaudichaud&#x27;s name, &quot;Erythrina monosperma&quot;, was used by most of those who described the Hawaiian species of &quot;Erythrina&quot; throughout the nineteenth century, including William Hillebrand.

In 1932, Otto Degener created the name &quot;Erythrina sandwicensis&quot; to replace &quot;Erythrina monosperma&quot;. He stated no reason for the name change. He presented a more complete synonymy than the one given here. &quot;Erythrina sandwicensis&quot; is the name that has been used since 1932.

<doc id="1151358" wikidata="Q313735" url="?curid=1151358" title="Lucius Caesar">
<text>Lucius Caesar (17 BC – 20 August 2 AD) was a grandson of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The son of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, Augustus&#x27; only daughter, Lucius was adopted by his grandfather along with his older brother, Gaius Caesar. As the emperor&#x27;s adopted sons and joint-heirs to the Roman Empire, Lucius and Gaius had promising political and military careers. However, Lucius died of a sudden illness on 20 August 2 AD, in Massilia, Gaul, while traveling to meet the Roman army in Hispania. His brother Gaius also died at a relatively young age on 21 February 4 AD. The untimely loss of both heirs compelled Augustus to redraw the line of succession by adopting Lucius&#x27; younger brother, Agrippa Postumus as well as his stepson, Tiberius on 26 June 4 AD.

==Background==
Lucius&#x27; father Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was an early supporter of Augustus (then &quot;Octavius&quot;) during the Final War of the Roman Republic that ensued as a result of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. He was a key general in Augustus&#x27; armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against Mark Antony and Sextus Pompeius. From early in the emperor&#x27;s reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who was seemingly on his deathbed in 23 BC, a sign that he would become &quot;princeps&quot; were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor&#x27;s nephew, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, came of age. However, Marcellus died of an illness that had spread throughout the city of Rome that year.

With Marcellus gone, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter Julia the Elder, who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (&quot;the tribunician power&quot;) in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor&#x27;s power and authority, he was approaching the position of co-regent.

==Early life and family==
Lucius was born in Rome in 17 BC to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia. He was part of the imperial family of Augustus, known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and was related to all the Julio-Claudian emperors. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the second oldest grandson of emperor Augustus after his brother Gaius. He was the brother-in-law of Tiberius by his half-sister Vipsania Agrippina, and Claudius by his sister Agrippina the Elder&#x27;s marriage to Germanicus. Lucius&#x27; nephew was the future emperor Caligula, who was Germanicus&#x27; son.

Having no heir since the death of Marcellus, Augustus immediately adopted Lucius and his brother from their father by a symbolic sale following Lucius&#x27; birth, and named the two boys his heirs. It is unknown what their father thought of the adoption. Shortly after their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth ever &quot;Ludi Saeculares&quot; (&quot;Secular Games&quot;). The adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace – the &quot;Pax Augusta&quot;. Augustus, mostly by himself, taught Gaius and Lucius how to read and swim, as well as how to imitate his own handwriting. He insisted that they earn the applause of people, instead of allowing them to receive it freely. Their adoptive father initiated them into administrative life when they were still young, and sent them to the provinces as consuls-elect.

That year (17 BC) Lucius&#x27; family left for the province of Syria, because his father was given command of the eastern provinces with proconsular authority (&quot;imperium maius&quot;). In 13 BC, his father returned to Rome and was promptly sent to Pannonia to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12 BC), but the Pannonians gave up their plans. Agrippa returned to Campania in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after. The death of Lucius&#x27; father made succession a pressing issue. The &quot;aurei&quot; and &quot;denarii&quot; issued in 13–12 BC made clear the Emperor&#x27;s dynastic plans for Lucius and Gaius. Their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen.

==Career==

Augustus brought Lucius to the Forum Romanum in 2 BC to enroll him as a citizen. The event was made into a ceremony the same as Gaius&#x27; enrollment had been three years prior. Lucius assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot; (&quot;toga of manhood&quot;), marking the beginning of his adulthood, and he too was made &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;leader of the youth&quot;). Like Gaius, he was elected consul &quot;designatus&quot;, with the intent that he assume the consulship at the age of nineteen. There was only one difference in his titles from those of Gaius: that he was made a member of the college of augurs whereas Gaius was made a &quot;pontifex&quot; (&quot;pontiff&quot;). Augustus distributed 60 denarii to each Roman citizen to mark the occasion.

That same year, before his brother Gaius left for the east, Lucius and Gaius were given the authority to consecrate buildings, and they did, with their management of the games held to celebrate the dedication of the Temple of Mars Ultor (1 August 2 BC). Their younger brother, Postumus, participated in the Trojan games with the rest of the equestrian youth. 260 lions were slaughtered in the Circus Maximus, there was gladiatorial combat, a naval battle between the &quot;Persians&quot; and the &quot;Athenians&quot;, and 36 crocodiles were slaughtered in the Circus Flaminius.

While Gaius was in Armenia, Lucius had been sent by Augustus to complete his military training in Hispania. While on the way to his post, he fell ill and died on 20 August AD 2 in Massalia, Gaul. His death was followed by that of Gaius on 21 February AD 4. In the span of 18 months, the succession of Rome was shaken. The death of both Gaius and Lucius, the Emperor&#x27;s two most favored heirs, led Augustus to adopt his stepson, Tiberius, and his sole remaining grandson, Postumus Agrippa as his new heirs on 26 June AD 4.

==Post mortem==
The two heirs received many honours by citizens and city officials of the Empire, including &quot;Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana&quot; (Pisa), where it was decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament their passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. Posthumously the Senate voted honours for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields the boys had received on achieving the age of military service to be hung in the Senate House. The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the Mausoleum of Augustus alongside those of their father Agrippa and other members of the imperial family.

Tacitus and Cassius Dio both suggested that there may have been foul play involved in the death of Gaius and Lucius and that Lucius&#x27;s step-grandmother Livia may have had a hand in their deaths. Livia&#x27;s presumed motive may have been to orchestrate the accession of her own son Tiberius as heir to Augustus. Tiberius was named the heir of Augustus in AD 4.

==Ancestry==
==In popular culture==
* Lucius and his brother Gaius both appear as characters in the 1976 TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;; the series reverses the order of their deaths, with Gaius dying first. Lucius was played by Russell Lewis as a child and Simon MacCorkindale as an adult.

Meloni has three tattoos: a Cubist-inspired representation of the crucifixion of Christ on his upper left arm, a butterfly on his left upper thigh, and a Chinese astrological chart of his family on his right lower leg. In 2007, Meloni was inducted into his high school&#x27;s athletic Hall of Fame as a member of the undefeated 1978 football team, for which he was quarterback.

In 2014, Meloni bought the house used in the television show &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

In 2021, on an episode of PBS&#x27; &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, it was revealed that Meloni is a distant relative of Nancy Pelosi.

<text>Aly Dia (born 20 August 1965), commonly known as Ali Dia, is a Senegalese former professional footballer who played as a striker. In November 1996, Dia convinced Graeme Souness, then Southampton manager, that he was the cousin of FIFA World Player of the Year and Ballon d&#x27;Or winner George Weah, which led to him signing a one-month contract with Southampton days later. Dia played only one match in his short spell at the club. He came on as a substitute in a league game, but was then himself substituted. He was subsequently released, 14 days into his contract.

== Career ==
After a playing career at the lower levels in France and Germany, and having already failed trials at Gillingham, Bournemouth and Rotherham United, playing once in a reserve game for the latter, Dia joined non-league club Blyth Spartans, where he made only one substitute appearance – on 9 November 1996 in a Northern Premier League game against Boston United.

Days later, Dia was signed by Southampton manager Graeme Souness, after Souness received a phone call purporting to be from Liberian international and then-FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah. &quot;Weah&quot; told Souness that Dia was his cousin and had played for Paris Saint-Germain as well as 13 times for his country and should give him a chance at Southampton. None of this was true and the phone call to Souness was a hoax. Souness was convinced and, without any due diligence, Dia was signed on a one-month contract. However, it is disputed who made the initial call to Souness. Some sources state it was Dia&#x27;s friend from university, while some say it was Dia&#x27;s agent, and it has also been suggested that it was Dia himself who made the call. It was later reported that the same stunt had been pulled on Gillingham, who offered Dia a trial, but was let go by manager Tony Pulis who said that Dia was &quot;rubbish&quot;. Harry Redknapp, then manager of West Ham United, also received the same call but dismissed it as &quot;a wind-up&quot;.

Dia played just one game for Southampton, wearing the number 33 shirt, against Leeds United on 23 November 1996; he had originally been scheduled to play in a reserve team friendly against Arsenal, but the match was cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch. In the match against Leeds, he came on as a substitute for the injured Matt Le Tissier after 32 minutes, but was later substituted himself (for Ken Monkou) in the 85th minute; Leeds won the match 2–0. Le Tissier said: &quot;He ran around the pitch like Bambi on ice; it was very embarrassing to watch.&quot;

Dia was released by Southampton two weeks into his contract. Following his release, he went on trial with Port Vale scoring twice in a reserve game against Sunderland. After no offer from Vale followed, he briefly played for Conference National side Gateshead, before leaving in February 1997. Dia played eight games for the North East outfit, including scoring on his debut in a 5–0 win over Bath City. A day after his Gateshead debut, his George Weah hoax was revealed in the national media. A 2015 article from &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; stated that Dia had also successfully pulled the same ruse on FinnPa and VfB Lübeck. He left both clubs following poor playing performances.

Speaking to the &quot;Gateshead Post&quot; after the story broke, Dia laughed off the allegations and stated he had recently scored for Senegal in a 3–1 1998 World Cup qualifying win over Guinea. However, this claim was not true as Senegal had already been knocked out in the first round of qualifiers. Dia said: &quot;I have been portrayed as a con man and a poor player, but I am neither and intend to prove people wrong. Obviously I&#x27;m disappointed not to have made it in the Premiership, but I&#x27;ve got faith in my own ability and my only concern now is Gateshead. My contract is just until the end of the season. But if things go well, who knows, I could stay longer.&quot;

In the short spell between joining Saints and playing for Gateshead, he pocketed £3,500 in signing-on fees. Souness later admitted that Southampton paid Dia about £2,000 for his 14 days at the club, while Dia received a £1,500 signing-on fee at Gateshead. Dia was eventually transfer listed by Gateshead after a spell of poor form. After leaving Gateshead, he had a brief spell at Spennymoor United.

==Personal life==
Dia studied business at Northumbria University in Newcastle, graduating in 2001. He received a Master of Business Administration from San Francisco State University in 2003. After finishing his education, Dia worked in the business sector in Qatar. In 2016, &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; tracked down Dia and it was revealed that he was living in London, but was looking to move back to Qatar. He told them that the Southampton story was &quot;hurtful&quot; to him and his family, but insisted that he was not a liar and that he trained with Southampton for a month and a half, where he impressed before making his debut, despite previous reports that he spent less than a week with Southampton before he made his infamous debut.

His son, Simon Dia, is a French football player, born and raised in France.

== Legacy ==
Dia has regularly featured in lists of bad players or bad transfers. He was named at Number 1 in a list of &quot;The 50 worst footballers&quot; in &quot;The Times&quot; and on ESPN&#x27;s ranking of the 50 worst transfers in Premier League history.

<text>Alda Neves da Graça do Espírito Santo (30 April 1926 – 9 March 2010), known as Alda do Espírito Santo or Alda Graça, was a poet from São Tomé and Príncipe working in the Portuguese language. She also served in the Santomean government after the country&#x27;s independence.

==Life and career==
She was born in São Tomé e Príncipe, the former Portuguese territory off the coast of West Africa, to João Graça do Espírito Santo and Maria de Jesus Agostinho das Neves. The family was prominent in São Tomé city. After primary school, she attended secondary school in Portugal. In 1948 Alda da Graça began studying in Lisbon to become a primary school teacher.

While in Lisbon, Alda da Graça met students from other Portuguese colonies and joined a student association called the Casa dos Estudantes do Império. In 1951, she founded Centro de Estudos Africanos with other students interested in communism and socialism, including Mário Pinto de Andrade and Agostinho Neto of Angola, Noémia de Sousa and Marcelino dos Santos of Mozambique, and Amílcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau.

Alda da Graça returned to São Tomé in January 1953. She worked as a teacher and continued to be active in nationalist circles. In December 1965 she was arrested and imprisoned for several months by the Portuguese authorities as a result of her identification with the African liberation movement.

Since 1975, when São Tomé and Príncipe achieved independence from Portugal, she held several high offices in the government, including as Minister of Education and Culture, Minister of Information and Culture, President of the National Assembly, and General Secretary of the National Union of Writers and Artists of São Tomé and Príncipe.

She was also the author of the lyrics to the national anthem, &quot;Independência total&quot;. Her published work includes &quot;O Jorgal das Ilhas&quot; (1976) and &quot;O Nosso o Solo Sagrado de Terra&quot; (1978). Her poem &quot;The Same Side of the Canoe&quot; (translated by Kathleen Weaver) is included in such anthologies as &quot;The Penguin Book of Women Poets&quot; (1987) and &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot; (1992).

In 2006, she wrote a preface to &quot;Retalhes do massacre de Batepá&quot;, a book by Manuel Teles Neto Da Costa.

She died aged 83 in hospital in Luanda, Angola, on 10 March 2010, when five days of national mourning was declared by the government of São Tomé e Principe.

<text>Albert Waller Gilchrist (January 15, 1858 – May 15, 1926) was an American politician who served as the 20th governor of Florida. Gilchrist was born in South Carolina before moving to Punta Gorda, Florida. A Democrat, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1893 and served as speaker in 1905. Gilchrist is the namesake for Gilchrist County, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Born in Greenwood, South Carolina, Gilchrist first attended Carolina Military Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity before attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. He would have graduated in 1882, but he did not because he was deficient in experimental philosophy after three years.

===Early career===
Gilchrist became a civil engineer and real estate dealer before settling in Punta Gorda, Florida, to become an orange grower. He served in the Florida state militia until 1898, reaching the rank of brigadier general. Gilchrist went on to join the Company C, of the 3rd U.S. Volunteer Infantry, and served in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War in Cuba. He reached the rank of captain in the regular army, before being discharged in 1899.
==Political career==
In 1893, Gilchrist was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. He served in it until 1897. He represented DeSoto County, Florida. He returned in 1903, and in 1905 he became Speaker of the Florida House and left the legislature.

Gilchrist was elected governor on November 3, 1908, taking the oath of office on January 5, 1909. As governor, Gilchrist prioritized public health. For instance, he promoted legislation for a pure food law, improved health conditions for state prisoners, a tuberculosis sanitarium, and a &quot;hospital for impoverished crippled children.&quot;

Also during his tenure as governor, the Montverde Industrial School was established, new counties were formed, and, following eight years of work, mainland Florida was finally connected to the Florida Keys via an overseas railroad. He left office on January 7, 1913. He ran for U.S. Senate in 1916 and served as a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention.

==Death==
Gilchrist died on May 15, 1926, in New York, New York. Upon his death, the bachelor governor left a large portion of his estate to local orphans. He is buried at Indian Springs Cemetery on Indian Springs Road in Punta Gorda, Florida.

==Legacy==
After hearing that the former Governor was dying in a New York hospital, the Florida Legislature quickly introduced and passed a bill naming Gilchrist County after him. The Gilchrist Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 41 south over the Peace River from Port Charlotte to Punta Gorda, is named after Gilchrist.

=== Controversy ===
In 2020, Teddy Ehmann, president of the Charlotte County Historical Society, urged the Punta Gorda City Council to rename Gilchrist Park, of which Gilchrist was the namesake for. In his letter to the council, Ehmann said Gilchrist was a &quot;Southern racist&quot; and asked the council to recognize the indigenous Calusa tribe.

Theresa Murtha, director of the Punta Gorda History Center, said the proposal was &quot;outrageous&quot;. She said that Gilchrist was the only Governor of Florida from Punta Gorda, and had a role in the foundation of the city. Former cataloger Lynn Harrell said Gilchrist hired a crew of seven to eight black railroad employees and that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t have had a Black crew&quot; if he was a racist.

<text>State Road 692 (SR 692) was the number for a short freeway connector north of St. Petersburg, opened in 2002 to connect CR 296 (118th Avenue North) to SR 93 (Interstate 275). The road is now inventoried as part of State Road 686, being decommissioned in 2013.

==Route description==
SR 692 started at 118th Avenue North, with the road running east as a freeway towards Interstate 275, ending at I-275&#x27;s interchange with State Road 686, although SR 692 provided no access to SR 686.

Eastbound, it was signed for I-275, and westbound, it was signed for 118th Avenue North.

==History==
SR 692 opened in 2002. This is the first instance of a Florida State Road with this number. When it opened, SR 692 was unsigned. Initially, there was no ramp from I-275 northbound to SR 692, but the ramp was built at a later date.

The road was decommissioned in 2013, and transferred to State Road 686.

<doc id="1151410" wikidata="Q641794" url="?curid=1151410" title="Canadian nationalism">
<text>Canadian nationalism () has been a significant political force since the 19th century and has typically manifested itself as seeking to advance Canada&#x27;s independence from the influence of the United Kingdom and the United States. Since the 1960s, most proponents of Canadian nationalism have advocated a civic nationalism due to Canada&#x27;s cultural diversity that specifically has sought to equalize citizenship, especially for and other French-speaking Canadians, who historically faced cultural and economic discrimination and assimilationist pressure from English Canadian-dominated governments. Canadian nationalism became an important issue during the 1988 Canadian federal election that focused on the then-proposed Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, with Canadian nationalists opposing the agreement saying that the agreement would lead to inevitable complete assimilation and domination of Canada by the United States. During the 1995 Quebec referendum to determine whether Quebec would become a sovereign state or whether it would remain in Canada, Canadian nationalists and federalists supported the &quot;no&quot; side while Quebec nationalists largely supported the &quot;yes&quot; side, resulting in a razor-thin majority in favour of the &quot;no&quot; side.

Canadian nationalism in English-speaking Canada opts for a certain level of sovereignty for Canada vis-à-vis other sovereign states, while remaining within the Commonwealth of Nations. The Canadian Tories have historically exemplified this formulation of nationalism in their opposition to free trade with the United States, stemming from a fear of economic and cultural assimilation. On the other hand, French Canadian nationalism prioritizes the preservation of the nation. This French-Canadian nationalism has existed ever since the conquest of New France in the mid-eighteenth century. Although radical French-speaking reformers in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 supported the creation of a new republic, a more accurate portrait of French-Canadian nationalism is illustrated by such figures as Henri Bourassa during the first half of the twentieth century. Bourassa advocated for a nation less reliant on Great Britain whether politically, economically or militarily. After Bourassa and during the Quiet Revolution, French-Canadian nationalism in Quebec evolved into Quebec nationalism. Quebec nationalists include sovereigntists, who believe Quebec should secede from Canada, and autonomists, who believe Quebec should hold extensive self-governing power within Canada.

== History ==
The goal of all economic and political nationalists has been the creation and then maintenance of Canadian sovereignty. During Canada&#x27;s colonial past there were various movements in both Upper Canada (present day Ontario) and Lower Canada (present day Quebec) to achieve independence from the British Empire. These culminated in the failed Rebellions of 1837. These movements had republican and pro-American tendencies and many of the rebels fled to the United States following the failure of the rebellion. Afterwards Canadian patriots began focusing on self-government and political reform within the British Empire. This was a cause championed by early Liberals such as the Reform Party and the Clear Grits, while Canada&#x27;s early Conservatives, supported by loyalist institutions and big business, supported stronger links to Britain. Following the achievement of constitutional independence in 1867 (Confederation) both of Canada&#x27;s main parties followed separate nationalistic themes. The early Liberal Party of Canada generally favoured greater diplomatic and military independence from the British Empire while the early Conservative Party of Canada fought for economic independence from the United States.

=== Free trade with the United States ===
Starting before Confederation in 1867, the debate between free trade and protectionism was a defining issue in Canadian politics. Nationalists, along with pro-British loyalists, were opposed to the idea of free trade or reciprocity for fear of having to compete with American industry and losing sovereignty to the United States. This issue dominated Canadian politics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the Tories taking a populist, anti-free trade stance. Conservative leader John A. Macdonald advocated an agenda of economic nationalism, known as the National Policy. This was very popular in the industrialized Canadian east. While the Liberal Party of Canada took a more classical liberal approach and supported the idea of an &quot;open market&quot; with the United States, something feared in eastern Canada but popular with farmers in western Canada. The National Policy also included plans to expand Canadian territory into the western prairies and populate the west with immigrants.

In each &quot;free trade election&quot;, the Liberals were defeated, forcing them to give up on the idea. The issue was revisited in the 1980s by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Mulroney reversed his party&#x27;s protectionist tradition, and, after claiming to be against free trade during his leadership campaign in 1983, went forward with negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States. His government believed that this would cure Canada&#x27;s ills and unemployment, which had been caused by a growing deficit and a terrible economic recession during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The agreement was drawn up in 1987 and an election was held on the issue in 1988. The Liberals, in a reversal of their traditional role, campaigned against free trade under former Prime Minister John Turner. The Tories won the election with a large majority, partially due to Mulroney&#x27;s support in Quebec among Quebec nationalists to whom he promised &quot;distinct society&quot; status for their province.

After the election of 1988, opponents of free trade pointed to the fact that the PC Party of Brian Mulroney received a majority of seats in parliament with only 43% of the vote while together the Liberal Party and New Democratic Party both of whom opposed the agreement received 51% of the vote, showing opposition from a clear majority of the population.

=== World wars ===
The impact of World War I on the evolution of Canada&#x27;s identity is debated by historians. While there is a consensus that on the eve of the war, most English-speaking Canadians had a hybrid imperial-national identity, the war&#x27;s effects on Canada&#x27;s emergence as a nation are complex. The Canadian media often refers to the First World War and, in particular, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, as marking &quot;the birth of a nation.&quot; Some historians consider the First World War to be Canada&#x27;s &quot;war of independence.&quot; They argue that the war decreased the extent to which Canadians identified with the British Empire and intensified their sense of being Canadians first and British subjects second.

This sense was expressed during the Chanak crisis when, for the first time, the Canadian government stated that a decision by the British government to go to war would not automatically entail Canadian participation.

Other historians robustly dispute the view that World War I undermined the hybrid imperial-national identity of English-speaking Canada. Phillip Buckner states that: &quot;The First World War shook but did not destroy this Britannic vision of Canada. It is a myth that Canadians emerged from the war alienated from, and disillusioned with, the imperial connection.&quot; He argues that most English-speaking Canadians &quot;continued to believe that Canada was, and should continue to be, a &#x27;British&#x27; nation and that it should cooperate with the other members of the British family in the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; Nevertheless, there are two possible mechanisms whereby World War I may have intensified Canadian nationalism: 1) Pride in Canada&#x27;s accomplishments on the battlefield demonstrably promoted Canadian patriotism, and 2) the war distanced Canada from Britain in that Canadians reacted to the sheer slaughter on the Western Front by adopting an increasingly anti-British attitude.

Still, Governor General The Lord Tweedsmuir raised the ire of Canadian imperialists when he said in Montreal in 1937: &quot;a Canadian&#x27;s first loyalty is not to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but to Canada and Canada&#x27;s King.&quot; The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; dubbed the statement &quot;disloyal.&quot;

=== Québécois nationalism ===

Another early source of pan-Canadian nationalism came from Quebec in the early 20th century. Henri Bourassa, Mayor of Montebello and one-time Liberal Member of Parliament created the Canadian Nationalist League (Ligue nationaliste canadienne) supporting an independent role for Canada in foreign affairs and opposed Canadian dependence on either Britain or the United States. A prominent supporter of a complete &quot;economic autonomy&quot; of the Canadian economy, Bourassa was instrumental in defeating Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1911 over the issue of a Canadian Navy under the command of the British Admiralty, something he furiously opposed. In so doing, he aided the Conservative Party of Robert Borden in that election, a party with strong pro-imperialist sympathies.

In the federal election of 1917 he was also instrumental in opposing the Borden government&#x27;s plan for conscription and as a result assisted the Laurier Liberals in Quebec. His vision of a unified, bi-cultural, tolerant and sovereign Canada remains an ideological inspiration to many Canadian nationalists. Alternatively, his French Canadian nationalism and support for maintaining French Canadian culture would inspire Quebec nationalists, many of whom were supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement.

This Quebec sovereignty movement gained traction through the Quiet Revolution and burst on the Canadian scene in the latter half of the twentieth century. In 1970, radical sovereigntists under the FLQ sparked the October Crisis when they kidnapped the provincial Labour Minister Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross in an effort to further the cause of Quebec sovereignty. Although this crisis soon abated, the sovereignty movement continued. Quebec held two referendums about whether the province should separate from the rest of Canada; the Canadian federalists defeated the Québécois separatists in the 1980 Quebec referendum by a margin of 59.56% to 40.44% and narrowly won again in the 1995 Quebec referendum by a margin of 50.58% to 49.42%. This second referendum marked the high water mark of the Quebec sovereignty movement and the broader Québécois nationalism continued to decline in the early twenty-first century.

Under the Coalition Avenir Québec government, Québécois nationalism has risen in a new form. In 2019, the provincial government passed &quot;Act respecting the laicity of the State&quot;. It prohibits the wearing of religious symbols by certain public employees in positions of authority and grandfathers in those who were already in office when the bill was introduced. In 2022, the provincial government introduced &quot;An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Quebec&quot; which would greatly expand the requirement to speak French in many public and private settings. The government has justified both of these measures, which are strongly opposed in the English-speaking provinces, as necessary to preserve the secularism and the French language that are central to Québécois nationalism.

=== Nationalist politics ===
Modern attempts at forming a popular Canadian nationalist party have failed, a phenomenon decried by Canadian philosopher George Grant in his seminal 1965 &quot;Lament for a Nation&quot;. Grant&#x27;s thesis is that Prime Minister Diefenbaker&#x27;s defeat in 1963 was the last gasp of Canadian nationalism and that the Canadian nation has succumbed to the continentalism of the United States.

The National Party of Canada was the most successful of recent attempts to revive Canadian nationalism in an electoral party. Led by former publisher Mel Hurtig the Nationals received more than 183,000 votes or 1.38% of the popular vote in the 1993 election. Infighting however led to the party&#x27;s demise shortly afterwards. This was followed by the formation of the Canadian Action Party in 1997. Created by a former Liberal Minister of Defence, Paul Hellyer, the CAP has failed to attract significant attention from the electorate since that time. An organic farmer and nationalist activist from Saskatchewan named David Orchard attempted to bring a nationalist agenda to the forefront of the former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In spite of attracting thousands of new members to a declining party he was unsuccessful in taking over the leadership and preventing the merger with the former Canadian Alliance.

Various activist/lobby groups such as the Council of Canadians, along with other progressive, environmentalist and labour groups have campaigned tirelessly against attempts to integrate the Canadian economy and harmonize government policies with that of the United States. They point to threats allegedly posed to Canada&#x27;s environment, natural resources, social programs, the rights of Canadian workers and cultural institutions. These echo the concerns of a large segment of the Canadian population. The nationalist Council of Canadians took a role of leadership in protesting discussions on the Security and Prosperity Partnership and earlier talks between previous Canadian and US governments on &quot;deep integration&quot;.

 concerns regarding national unity have ebbed to some degree and nationalist sentiment among the population overall has increased. Even in Quebec, long a hotbed of secessionist sentiment, a large majority has emerged that expresses pride and loyalty toward Canada as a whole. Canada has even been described as &quot;post-national&quot;, a description that some critics have argued runs counter to current trends in Europe and the United States. Prime Minister Trudeau, elected in 2015, has however espoused distinctly anti-nationalist sentiments during his tenure (or at least sentiments that are contrary to traditional nationalism). To the extent Canadians have embraced nationalism in recent years, it has been a more &quot;inclusive,&quot; civic nationalism, as contrasted with the &quot;exclusive&quot; nationalism that has arisen recently in the US and some other Western nations.

<text>The Dali Kingdom, also known as the Dali State (; Bai: Dablit Guaif), was a dynastic state situated in modern Yunnan province, China from 937 until 1253. In 1253, it was conquered by the Mongols but members of its former ruling house continued to administer the area as &quot;tusi&quot; chiefs under the auspices of the Yuan dynasty until the Ming conquest of Yunnan in 1382. Today the former capital of the Dali Kingdom is still called Dali in modern Yunnan Province.

==Name==
The Dali Kingdom takes its name from Dali City. Famed for its high quality marble, Dali (dàlǐ 大理) literally means &quot;marble&quot; in Chinese.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Nanzhao was overthrown in 902 and three dynasties followed in quick succession before Duan Siping seized power in 937, establishing himself at Dali. The Duan clan professed to have Han ancestry. Yuan dynasty records said the Duan family came from Wuwei in Gansu:

=== Relations with the Song dynasty ===
Dali&#x27;s relationship with the Song was cordial throughout its entire existence. Dali congratulated the Song dynasty on the conquest of Later Shu in 965 and voluntarily established tribute relations in 982. It was however essentially an independent state. At times the Song even declined offers of tribute. The Song founder Song Taizu declared all land south of the Dadu River to be Dali territory and did not desire to pursue any further claims to avoid the Tang dynasty&#x27;s disastrous efforts against Nanzhao.

Dali&#x27;s primary importance to the Song dynasty was its horses, which were highly prized and sought after as military assets, especially after the fall of the Northern Song. They were described by a Song official in the following passage:

=== Dazhong Kingdom (1094-1096) ===
In 1094, the former prime minister Gao Shengtai forced King Duan Zhengming to relinquish the throne to him and renamed the Dali Kingdom to &quot;Dazhong Kingdom&quot;. Gao Shengtai ruled briefly until his death in 1096, after which the throne was returned to the Duan family. Duan Zhengming&#x27;s younger brother, Duan Zhengchun, became the new ruler and restored the kingdom&#x27;s former name.

=== Intervention in Đại Việt ===
According to a Vietnamese stone inscription, in 1096 a Dali magician was said to have plotted a conspiracy to murder King Lý Nhân Tông. After the death of Nhân Tông in 1127, his adopted son (by concubine) named Zhizhi had escaped to Dali, changed his surname to Zhao, and assumed the title &quot;pingwang&quot; (peaceful king). When he learned that his older brother, King Lý Thần Tông, had died in 1137, Zhizhi returned to Đại Việt and attacked Lý Anh Tông with 3,000 Dali troops. However, he was defeated and executed.

=== Fall ===

Möngke Khan sent envoys requesting the surrender of Dali. The king of Dali murdered the envoys and when Möngke received word of this, he placed his brother Kublai in charge of invading Dali. 

Kublai split his army into three columns. The western column was led by Uriyangkhadai, who was the son of Subutai, and he was instructed to march from Lintao through Kham into Dali. Wang Dezhen led the eastern column through Sichuan. Wang&#x27;s column rejoined Kublai&#x27;s middle column at Jianchang in southern Sichuan. Kublai planned to engage Dali&#x27;s main army at the Jinsha River, leaving Dali vulnerable to Uriyangkhadai&#x27;s forces to the northwest. After several skirmishes where Dali forces turned back Mongol raids across the Jinsha River, Kublai&#x27;s army crossed the river during the night and routed the Dali army. In late 1253, the three columns converged on the city of Dali.

The king of Dali, Duan Xingzhi, fled to the town of Shanchan (near modern Kunming) and rallied pro-Dali forces to oppose the Mongol invasion. It took another two years of fighting before the Mongols captured the cities of Dali and Shanchan. However the resistance against the Mongols continued to the east of Shanchan with the assistance of the Yi kingdoms and the Song dynasty.

In 1256, Duan Xingzhi surrendered and presented to Möngke with maps of Yunnan. Duan Xingzhi of Dali was enfeoffed as Maharaja (摩诃罗嵯), and the Duan imperial family continued to hold the title of Maharaja in Yunnan as vassals to the Mongols under the supervision of Borjigin imperial princes and Muslim governors. The Duan family reigned in Dali while the governors served in Kunming. After the Ming conquest of Yunnan, the members of the Duan clan were scattered in various distant areas of China by the Hongwu Emperor.

=== Yunnan under the Yuan dynasty ===
====Resistance====
Uriyangkhadai remained in Yunnan to oversee Duan&#x27;s rule of Dali and to push further east into the Song dynasty. By mid-1256, 20 military brigades had been established throughout Dali and military units had been sent to attack Ziqi. Mongols and Central Asians filled brigade commander positions while members of the local elite staffed the subbrigade battalions. Uriyangkhadai rewarded locals who had supported the Mongol invasion and created a new elite to rival the old pro-Dali elite.

In late 1256, Uriyangkhadai forced the local collaborators in Shanchan to attack the Yi kingdoms in eastern Yunnan and western Guizhou. Those who refused were killed. The Song supported the Yi kingdoms by sending them 10,000 taels of silver and instructing them to defending Ziqi. The Song backed forces invaded the Shanchan region in support of an anti-Mongol rebellion led by Sheliwei. At the same time, Uriyangkhadai was called away to invade Đại Việt under the Trần dynasty. Fierce fighting continued between the Mongol-Dali forces and the Shanchan resistance until Sheliwei was killed in a Mongol ambush in 1274.

The Duan family governed Yunnan&#x27;s various indigenous peoples for eleven generations until the end of Mongol rule. They willingly contributed soldiers to the Mongol campaign against the Song dynasty. In 1271, they aided the Yuan dynasty in putting down a Mongol rebellion in Yunnan.

====Ajall Shams al-Din Omar====
In 1274, Ajall Shams al-Din Omar was assigned by Kublai to stabilize Yunnan. He repaired the road connecting Dali and Shanchan and a network of 78 postal relay stations was established from Dali to the town of Shicheng (modern Qujing). Instead of the military brigades established by Uriyangkhadai, Sayyid&#x27; Ajall established political units similar to those in China with circuits, routes, prefectures, and counties. The Yunnan Branch Secretariat was divided into ten circuits, each headed by a pacification commissioner (&quot;xuanwei shi&quot;). Prefectures and counties were governed by a route commander. Directives by each administrative unit was cosigned by a &quot;darughachi&quot; and a civilian official.

He instituted a native chieftain system that came to be known as tusi which assigned ranks and posts to native chieftains. Under this institution of &quot;rule based on native customs&quot; the locals retained much of their autonomy with the exception of three obligations. One, they would provide surrendered troops to the Yuan government. Two, local chieftains would provide tribute to the Yuan court. Three, they would follow the rules of appointment, succession, promotion, degradation, reward, and punishment of native chieftains created by the Yuan court.

In the Shanchan region of central Yunnan, Sayyid&#x27; Ajall created eight routes: Zhongqing, Dengjiang, Lingan, Yuanjiang, Guangxi, Qujing, Wuding, and Weichu. They were ruled by a new post, the &quot;tuguan&quot; (native official). The &quot;tuguan&quot; were official representatives of the Yuan dynasty but retained much autonomy, including the right of passing their hereditary post to their offspring, and autonomy to govern so long as they did not harbour criminals or behave in an anti-Yuan manner. The &quot;tuguan&quot; were obligated to pay taxes in the form of horses, precious metals, and finished goods. They also had to provide military support when requested. The Yi kingdoms to the east were assigned the same posts and given similar terms.

The &quot;tuguan&quot; were given a certificate of appointment (&quot;gaochi&quot;) that was publicly displayed at the &quot;tuguan&quot;&#x27;s administrative headquarters. They were also given a seal (&quot;yinzheng&quot;) to issue orders as representatives of the Yuan state. A tiger tally was granted to authorize maintenance of horses for military mattes. Gold and silver tallies were issued to mobilize military resources. 

Sayyid &#x27;Ajall introduced new agricultural techniques and published handbooks in the region. In Shanchan, he oversaw hydraulic projects such as dam and reservoir construction, river and canal dredging for transportation purposes, and draining swamps for land reclamation. He established 55 schools in Yunnan based on a Chinese curriculum and hired Han Chinese instructors to staff them. However most of them were defunct by the beginning of the 14th century. Farming households and garrisons were set up as far south as Dechang to expand agricultural production and to maintain the highway and its postal stations for the government.

Yuan rule also introduced a significant Muslim influence into Yunnan.

====Duan under Yuan dynasty====
The 10th Governor-General of Dali Duan Gong was married to the Mongol Borjigin Princess Agai, daughter of the Yuan dynasty Prince of Liang, Basalawarmi. They had a son and a daughter,
Duan Sengnu. their children were also called Duan Qiangna and Duan Bao. However the Mongols feared the power of Duan Gong and killed him. Duan Sengnu raised Duan Bao to take revenge against Basalawarmi for the killing of Duan Gong. A play was made based on these events. According to Yuan documents, the Duan family were originally ethnic Han from Wuwei commandery, Gansu. Other Duan families also originated from Wuwei.

=== Conquest of Yunnan by the Ming dynasty ===

In 1381, the Ming dynasty dispatched 300,000 troops to crush the Yuan remnants in Yunnan.

The Duan clan, who helped the Yuan dynasty against a Red Turban Rebellion attack from Sichuan, also fought against the Ming army. Duan Shi, the 13th and the last hereditary Governor-General of Dali, refused to surrender by writing to Fu Youde, making it clear that Dali could only be a tributary to the Ming. In 1382 Lan Yu and Mu Ying&#x27;s forces attacked and crushed Duan&#x27;s realm after a fierce battle. The Duan family were then taken captive and escorted to the Ming capital of Nanjing.

== Government ==
Under the influence of Chinese officials present from early times, the Dali elite used Chinese script supplemented by Bai characters, which were themselves constructed based on Chinese characters. The Dali court granted hereditary fiefs to pre-existing clan chiefs, in particular the Duan, Gao, Yang, and Dong clans, to win over their support. Some administrative units were designated semi-autonomous military divisions. Similarly to the Nanzhao military, the Dali military consisted of a standing army, townsfolk peasant-soldiers and indigenous militia.

The rulers of Dali continued the traditions of Nanzhao, such as the royal title &quot;piaoxin&quot; (Lord of Pyu), the use of the same tall crowns, and taking Acuoye Guanyin as their tutelary deity. They also used the title emperor (&quot;huangdi&quot;).

==Language and ethnicity==

Extant sources from Nanzhao and the Dali Kingdom show that the ruling elite used Chinese script. The vast majority of Dali sources are written in Classical Chinese. However the ruling elite also used Bai language for communication, but no attempt was made to standardize or popularize the script, and it remained an unofficial writing system.

Today, most Bai people trace their ancestry to Nanzhao and the Dali Kingdom, but records from those kingdoms do not mention the Bai. The earliest references to &quot;Bai people&quot;, or the &quot;Bo&quot;, are from the Yuan dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the Bai were also known as &quot;Minjia&quot; (civilians). A Bai script using Chinese characters was mentioned during the Ming dynasty.

According to Stevan Harrell, while the ethnic identity of Nanzhao&#x27;s ruling elite is still disputed, the subsequent Yang and Duan dynasties were both definitely Bai.

==Religion==
A version of Buddhism known as Azhali existed in Yunnan since the 9th century. The last king of Nanzhao established Buddhism as the state religion and many Dali kings continued the tradition. Ten of Dali&#x27;s 22 kings retired to become Buddhist monks.

Fan Chengda (1126-1193) encountered a Dali trade mission and noted that they sought Chinese literature, medical texts, Buddhist scriptures, and dictionaries in return for horses. He marveled that &quot;these people all possessed proper etiquette, and carried and recited Buddhist scriptural books.&quot;

<text>Fedora Legacy was a community-supported, open-source software project to freely distribute patches for critical software bugs and vulnerabilities to users of older versions of the Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core Linux distributions, after the publisher, Red Hat, ceased support.

Jesse Keating and David Eisenstein, two of the Fedora Legacy software maintainers, announced the discontinuation of the project on 31 December 2006.

Fedora Legacy later cited the following as reasons for discontinuing the project: Not enough people contributing, testing, and deploying patches; not enough funds; waning interest in the project and new discussion about extending the software release life cycle of Fedora Core.

Just before the discontinuation, Fedora Legacy was providing updates for Red Hat Linux versions 7.3 and 9, and Fedora Core 3 and 4. They ceased support for Fedora Core 1 and 2 when Red Hat published Fedora Core 6 Test 2. Earlier in 2006, Fedora Legacy announced their intention to provide updates for Red Hat 7.3 and 9 by the end of the year, and then to focus on Fedora Core 3 and 4.

<text>Maldon and East Chelmsford was a parliamentary constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. From 1997 to 2010 it elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

== History ==
This seat was created for the 1997 general election from parts of the abolished constituencies of South Colchester and Maldon and Chelmsford. It was abolished at the next redistribution which came into effect for the 2010 general election, when the Chelmsford and Maldon constituencies were re-established.

It was a safe Conservative seat throughout its existence.

==Boundaries==

* The District of Maldon; and
* The Borough of Chelmsford wards of Baddow Road and Great Baddow Village, Galleywood, Little Baddow, Danbury and Sandon, Rothmans, and Woodham Ferrers and Bicknacre.

The constituency was formed from the bulk of the abolished South Colchester and Maldon constituency (the District of Maldon) and eastern parts of the abolished constituency of Chelmsford, including eastern suburbs of the City of Chelmsford (Great Baddow and Galleywood).

Following their review into parliamentary representation in Essex, the Boundary Commission for England abolished the Maldon and East Chelmsford constituency for the 2010 general election. The majority of the constituency, including Maldon and Burnham-on-Crouch, was incorporated into the re-established constituency of Maldon; northern areas were added to the new constituency of Witham; and the Chelmsford suburbs of Great Baddow and Galleywood were included in the re-established constituency of Chelmsford (now a Borough Constituency). This resulted in Maldon District being split between constituencies for the first time.

<doc id="1151454" wikidata="Q2372105" url="?curid=1151454" title="Pregnancy over age 50">
<text>Pregnancy over the age of 50 has become possible for more women because of advances in assisted reproductive technology, in particular egg donation. Typically, a woman&#x27;s fecundity ends with menopause, which, by definition, is 12 consecutive months without any menstrual flow at all. During perimenopause, the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether. The female biological clock can vary greatly from woman to woman. A woman&#x27;s individual level of fertility can be tested through a variety of methods.

In the United States, between 1997 and 1999, 539 births were reported among mothers over age 50 (four per 100,000 births), with 194 being over 55.

The oldest recorded mother to date to conceive was 74 years. According to statistics from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, in the UK more than 20 babies are born to women over age 50 per year through in vitro fertilization with the use of donor oocytes (eggs).

Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara formerly held the record of oldest verified mother; she was aged 66 years 358 days when she gave birth to twins, 130 days older than Adriana Iliescu, who gave birth in 2005 to a baby girl. In both cases, the children were conceived through IVF with donor eggs. The oldest verified mother to conceive naturally (listed currently in the Guinness Records) is Dawn Brooke (Guernsey); she conceived a son at the age of 59 in 1997.

Erramatti Mangamma, who gave birth at the age of 73 through in-vitro fertilisation via caesarean section in the city of Hyderabad, India, currently holds the record for being the oldest living mother. She delivered twin baby girls, making her also the oldest mother to give birth to twins.
The previous record for being the oldest living mother was held by Daljinder Kaur Gill from Amritsar, India, who gave birth to a baby boy at age 72 through in-vitro fertilisation.

== Age considerations ==
Menopause typically occurs between 44 and 58 years of age. DNA testing is rarely carried out to confirm claims of maternity at advanced ages, but in one large study, among 12,549 African and Middle Eastern immigrant mothers, confirmed by DNA testing, only two mothers were found to be older than fifty; the oldest mother being 52.1 years at conception (and the youngest mother 10.7 years old).

== Medical considerations ==
The risk of pregnancy complications increases as the mother&#x27;s age increases. Risks associated with childbearing over the age of 50 include an increased incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertension, delivery by caesarean section, miscarriage, preeclampsia, and placenta previa. In comparison to mothers between 20 and 29 years of age, mothers over 50 are at almost three times the risk of low birth weight, premature birth, and extremely premature birth; their risk of extremely low birth weight, small size for gestational age, and fetal mortality was almost double.

==Cases of pregnancy over age 50==

== Debate ==
Pregnancies among older women have been a subject of controversy and debate. Some argue against motherhood late in life on the basis of the health risks involved, or out of concern that an older mother might not be able to give proper care for a child as she ages, while others contend that having a child is a fundamental right and that it is commitment to a child&#x27;s wellbeing, not the parents&#x27; ages, that matters.

A survey of attitudes towards pregnancy over age 50 among Australians found that 54.6% believed it was acceptable for a post-menopausal woman to have her own eggs transferred and that 37.9% believed it was acceptable for a post-menopausal woman to receive donated ova or embryos.

Governments have sometimes taken actions to regulate or restrict later-in-life childbearing. In the 1990s, France approved a bill which prohibited post-menopausal pregnancy, which the French Minister of Health at the time, Philippe Douste-Blazy, said was &quot;... immoral as well as dangerous to the health of mother and child&quot;. In Italy, the Association of Medical Practitioners and Dentists prevented its members from providing women aged 50 and over with fertility treatment. Britain&#x27;s then-Secretary of State for Health, Virginia Bottomley, stated, &quot;Women do not have the right to have a child; the child has a right to a suitable home&quot;. However, in 2005, age restrictions on IVF in the United Kingdom were officially withdrawn.

Legal restrictions are only one of the barriers confronting women seeking IVF, as many fertility clinics and hospitals set age limits of their own.

<doc id="1151458" wikidata="Q162225" url="?curid=1151458" title="Fallen (1998 film)">
<text>Fallen is a 1998 American supernatural horror thriller film directed by Gregory Hoblit, produced by Charles Roven and Dawn Steel, from a screenplay by Nicholas Kazan. Denzel Washington plays a Philadelphia police detective who is investigating occult murders committed by an apparent copycat killer. John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini and Elias Koteas also star. Warner Bros. released &quot;Fallen&quot; on January 16, 1998 to mixed reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes visits serial killer Edgar Reese, whom he helped capture, on death row as Reese is about to be executed. Reese is in high spirits and, during conversation, grabs Hobbes&#x27; hand and delivers a spiteful monologue in an unknown language, assumed to be gibberish but later identified as Syrian Aramaic. As he is executed, Reese mocks the spectators and sings &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; by The Rolling Stones.

Hobbes and his partner Jonesy investigate a string of new murders reminiscent of Reese&#x27;s style, which they assume is by a copycat killer. Following hints given by Reese and the copycat killer, Hobbes tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano. Gretta explains that her father, a former detective, killed himself in an isolated cabin after being accused of a series of occult murders similar to the ones Hobbes and Jonesy are investigating. Hobbes visits the Milano family&#x27;s abandoned lake-house. In the basement he finds several unsettling books about demonic possession. He also discovers the name &quot;Azazel&quot; written on a wall, obscured under layers of paint and grime.

Hobbes asks Gretta about the name, but she strongly urges him to drop the case to protect the lives of himself and his loved ones. She reconsiders after a terrifying encounter with Azazel, who confronts her in the guise of several strangers on the street and attempts to possess her. Seeking sanctuary in a church, Gretta explains to Hobbes that Azazel is a fallen angel who can possess human beings by touch. Hobbes realizes that Azazel, while possessing Edgar Reese, shook his hand before the execution but was not able to possess him. Gretta explains that the demon will try to ruin his life and warns him of Azazel&#x27;s inevitable victory. Azazel visits Hobbes at his precinct, possesses his friend Detective Lou, and taunts him. Azazel moves from person to person, singing &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; after each transfer. Hobbes asks Lou and several others why they were singing the song, but they have no recollection. Hobbes runs outside and calls out to Azazel in Syrian Aramaic. The demon, now moving among people in the street, praises Hobbes for his cleverness. Hobbes says that he knows of Azazel&#x27;s true identity; the demon threatens him and disappears.

To provoke Hobbes, Azazel possesses his nephew Sam and attacks Hobbes&#x27; intellectually disabled brother Art in their home. Azazel again flees into other people on the street, ending up in a schoolteacher. As the teacher, Azazel draws a gun and forces Hobbes to shoot his host in front of a group of bystanders. Azazel boasts that if his current host is killed, he can transfer to another host in the surrounding area without needing to touch them.

Lieutenant Stanton informs Hobbes that his fingerprints were found at one of the murder scenes, and in light of the bizarre circumstances of the shooting of the teacher, he has become a suspect for all the murders. Azazel inhabits several of the witnesses and gives false accounts that the shooting was unprovoked, throwing further suspicion on Hobbes. Azazel comes into Hobbes&#x27; home and murders his brother, while marking Sam. Hobbes takes his nephew to Gretta&#x27;s house. Gretta explains that, if forced out of a host body, Azazel can only travel for as long as one breath can sustain him, after which he will die.

Hobbes goes to the Milano cabin and calls Jonesy, knowing he will trace the call. Stanton and Jonesy arrive to arrest Hobbes; however, Jonesy kills Stanton, revealing himself to be possessed. Azazel prepares to shoot himself, which will allow him to possess Hobbes, the only other person for miles around. Hobbes wrestles Jonesy for his gun, and Jonesy is fatally wounded. Hobbes smokes cigarettes which he explains have been laced with the same poison Azazel used to kill Hobbes&#x27; brother, which will leave Azazel stranded in the wilderness without a host. Hobbes taunts him and kills Jonesy. Azazel possesses Hobbes, frantically attempts to flee, and succumbs to the poison.

Azazel, in voiceover, mocks the audience for believing that he has lost, and a possessed cat emerges from beneath the cabin and heads back to civilization. The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; plays over the closing credits.

== Cast ==
== Release ==
&quot;Fallen&quot; was released in 2,448 theaters on January 16, 1998. It landed at #3 at the box office and made $10.4 million in its opening weekend. In its second weekend, it made $4.9 million. After being in cinemas for four weeks, the film made $23.3 million in the US and $981,200 internationally for a total of $25.2 million.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Fallen&quot; has an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 57 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Has an interesting premise. Unfortunately it&#x27;s just a recycling of old materials, and not all that thrilling.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;A stylish if seriously far-fetched nightmare&quot;, but &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Washington has the almost impossible task of holding together a convoluted picture that&#x27;s only intermittently suspenseful and not very engaging emotionally or intellectually&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, writing &quot;the idea is better than the execution, and by the end, the surprises become too mechanical and inevitable.” The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised Washington&#x27;s performance, but referring to the film&#x27;s continual use of The Rolling Stones song &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot;, wrote &quot;The first half of this movie holds some promise, but time is not on its side.&quot;

&quot;Fallen&quot; has since gained a cult following and is considered one of Washington’s more underrated performances.

<text>The Murchison Glacier is an long glacier flowing through Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park in the South Island of New Zealand. Lying to the east of the Malte Brun range and west of the Liebig Range, high in the Southern Alps, it flows from the Tasman Saddle at 2,435 m mostly southwestwards to around 1,110 m. The Murchison River, which takes its meltwater, flows under the larger Tasman Glacier to the south.

The Murchison Glacier is named after Roderick Murchison, one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society.

<text>The Mueller Glacier is a long glacier flowing through Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park in the South Island of New Zealand. It lies to the west of Mount Cook Village within the Southern Alps, flowing roughly north-west from its névé near Mount Montgomerie before curving around the Sealy Range as it approaches its terminus. Various other glaciers feed into the Mueller Glacier along its route, including the Frind and Huddleston Glaciers. The glacier ends at a small unnamed terminal lake, which is also fed by meltwater from the nearby Hooker Glacier. This lake is the source for the Hooker River, a small tributary of the Tasman River, which flows into Lake Pukaki.

The glacier was named after German-Australian botanist and explorer Ferdinand von Mueller. The Mueller Hut, located on the ridge of the Sealy Range east of the Mueller Glacier, was also named after Ferdinand von Mueller.

Based on dating of a yellow-green lichen of the Rhizocarpon subgenus, Mueller Glacier is considered to have had a Little Ice Age maximum mass between 1725 and 1730. White Horse Hill, a small hill to the north of Mount Cook Village, represents the moraine left from this period.

<text>An expressman (pl. &quot;expressmen&quot;) refers to anyone who has the duty of packing, managing, and ensuring the delivery of any cargo.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an expressman was someone whose responsibility it was to ensure the safe delivery of gold or currency, being shipped by railroad, and which was secured in the &quot;express car&quot;. This job included guarding the safe or other strongboxes or coffers against outlaws, and memorizing the safe&#x27;s combination to use at delivery.

==Origins==
For decades stagecoach drivers and baggage-wagoners performed many of the tasks that would be later formalized under the title expressman. The first express companies, which developed in the early 19th century, contracted with stagecoach lines to carry their goods.

By 1900 there were four major express companies. As express services matured into an industry, the tasks of stage-coach driver were divided among specialties, such as driver, expressman, agent, clerk, and others, rendering them outmoded. Many of the stage-coach drivers transitioned into the express industry. Some became expressmen; some became agents, managers, and company owners.

With the expansion of the railroads, express companies shifted to use that faster form of transportation. On the railroads, the men who later were called expressmen were initially referred to as &quot;conductors,&quot; as they were responsible for managing all or part of the express rail car. The title &quot;expressman&quot; was adopted later, as the specialty became more recognized.

==Role of expressman in the United States==
The express industry came about with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. It served a vital role in enabling companies to do business at regional and national levels. The expressman served not only as a courier, but as a highly ethical agent of currency, documents and other high-value items, and was considered a highly valuable employee.

===Dangers===
The inherent danger in their job led some to arm themselves. On major routes whole passenger cars were reserved for the expressmen, mainly for their security, as these agents would sit away from passengers as much as possible. 

In one incident, an expressman in a reserved car was shot in the head three times and robbed by a man pretending to be another expressman. He survived, and later aided in the prosecution of his attacker. On some routes, serial robberies were a serious concern. The expressmen would sometimes be accompanied by armed men for additional security, and some enlisted the Pinkerton Agency, which became established in this era.

==Expressmen in Europe==
The success of express shipping in the United States was quickly adopted by Great Britain and Europe. Harnden &amp; Co. established the Liverpool to Paris line, thus bringing the role of expressman with it. Within a decade, express routes had been extended to most principal cities on the European continent.

==20th century and decline==
The expressman as an occupation in the United States continued until President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s government nationalized the railroads on December 26, 1917, after the United States entered World War I. The United States Railroad Administration introduced changes to support the war effort. It standardized rolling stock and steam locomotive designs. The railroads were returned to private owners in 1920, after the war.

Federal postal workers and eventually parcel workers took over the management of US mail and packages on trains. At times railroads have used special freight conductors, to ride with trains to ensure the care and security of special cargo.

==Representation in other media==
Mark Twain featured expressmen in his short tale, &quot;The Invalid&#x27;s Story.&quot;

<doc id="1151475" wikidata="Q358467" url="?curid=1151475" title="Park Trammell">
<text>Park Monroe Trammell (April 9, 1876 – May 8, 1936), was an American attorney and politician from the state of Florida. Trammell represented Florida in the United States Senate from 1917 until his death in 1936. As chair of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, Trammell was essential in the creation of several laws that revitalized the United States Navy. Trammell previously served as the Governor of Florida and Florida Attorney General.

== Early life and education ==
Trammell was born on April 9, 1876, in Macon County, Alabama. When he was a young child, Trammell and his parents moved to a citrus farm near Lakeland, Florida. Trammell attended Vanderbilt University in 1898, before enlisting in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. Trammell served in the Quartermaster Corps, and was stationed in Tampa, Florida.

After the war, Trammell enrolled at Cumberland University, graduating in 1899. He was admitted into the Florida Bar the same year.

== Early career ==
Trammell, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Lakeland in 1900 and re-elected to a second term in 1901. In 1902, Trammell was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing Polk County. He served in the Florida House until 1904, when he was elected to the Florida Senate for Polk County. From 1905 until 1907, Trammell was the President of the Florida Senate. He resigned from the senate the following year, and returned to private practice.

In 1909, Trammell was appointed to serve as the 19th Florida Attorney General by Governor Albert W. Gilchrist.

=== Florida Governor ===
In the 1912 gubernatorial election, Trammell ran to succeed Gilchrist as Governor of Florida. After securing the Democratic nomination, Trammell defeated four other candidates in the general election, receiving 80% of the vote. His closest competitor was Socialist Thomas W. Cox.

As governor, Trammell presided over various labor laws and endorsed a law in the Florida Legislature that would control spending in election campaigns, and also established a state tax commission in order to equalize property assessments across various counties. Trammell&#x27;s governorship was also known for his blatant racism, endorsing racial segregation and overlooking the lynching of African Americans. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings of black men during his term were prosecuted, nor were the 21 that occurred during his governorship.

== United States Senate ==
With the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment on April 8, 1913, U.S. senators were to be popularly elected, rather than being elected by their state legislatures. Trammell ran for the U.S. Senate in the 1916 election, defeating incumbent Nathan P. Bryan in the Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, newsman William R. O&#x27;Neal, with nearly 83% of the vote.

During his tenure as senator, Trammell was not afraid to deviate from his party. He opposed, for instance,U.S. Supreme Court nominees Harlan F. Stone in 1925 and John J. Parker in 1930, the prior being successfully appointed to the court.

During the Great Depression, Trammell joined the Conservative Coalition, a group of conservative congressmen opposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, claiming it was too liberal, despite his overall support for Roosevelt. Opinions on the New Deal were additionally changing across the South, with many Southern Democrats who initially supported the legislation beginning to vote against it.

In Florida, the test of voters&#x27; approval of the New Deal was the Democratic primary of the 1934 U.S. Senate election, in which Trammell, who generally ran unopposed in the primaries, faced the stiffest competition of his entire career. Trammell faced former State Representative Claude Pepper, attorney Charles A. Mitchell, State Senator James F. Sikes, and Florida Democratic Committeewoman Hortense K. Wells. Though the race was mostly a competition between Trammell and Pepper, a social liberal, the latter three candidates pulled enough votes from Trammell to send the race into a runoff election between Trammell and Pepper. Trammell defeated Pepper in the runoff, winning by just a 2% margin. Trammell was unopposed in the general election.

Earlier in 1934, Trammell co-sponsored the Vinson-Trammell Act, along with House Naval Affairs Committee Chair Carl Vinson, which authorized the replacement of obsolete ship by construction of new ships in order to compete with the Japanese Empire.

During his time in the Senate, Trammell was often referred to as the most useless member of the body, having missed 642 out of 3,168 roll call votes across his entire tenure. Despite this, he was still popular among Florida voters.

Trammell was the chairman of the Senate Expenditures in the Treasury Department Committee from 1917 until 1919, and of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee from 1933 until his death in 1936.

== Death and legacy ==
Trammell died at his home in Washington, D.C., on May 8, 1936. He is buried in Lakeland&#x27;s Roselawn Cemetery.

Trammell&#x27;s senatorial papers were donated to the Lakeland Public Library and the University of Florida after his death. His gubernatorial papers reside in the Florida State Archives.

In 1955, the Lakeland Public Library building was named the Park Trammell Building. It now houses the Greater Lakeland Chamber of Commerce.

Built in 1955, the Park Trammell Building is a nine-story low-rise building in Tampa, which houses the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce.

The Park Trammell Building at the Florida State Mental Hospital in Chattahoochee, Florida, dedicated in 1956, is used to house the geriatric population of the institution.

== Personal life ==
Trammell married Virginia Darby on November 21, 1900. They were married until her death in 1922. He later married Beatrice Padgett, a divorced woman with a son, in 1934. Trammell had no children of his own with either woman.

His great-nephew is Jeffrey Trammell.
Trammell was a member of the Freemasons, the Knights of Pythias, and the Woodmen of the World.

<doc id="1151483" wikidata="Q788956" url="?curid=1151483" title="Bálint Bakfark">
<text>Bálint Bakfark (; in contemporary sources Valentin Bakfark or (from 1565 onward) Valentin Greff alias Bakfark, his name is variously spelled as &quot;Bacfarc&quot;, &quot;Bakfarc&quot;, &quot;Bakfarkh&quot;, &quot;Bakffark&quot;, &quot;Backuart&quot;) (c. 1507 – 15 or 22 August 1576) was a Hungarian composer of Transylvanian Saxon origin, and lutenist of the Renaissance. He was enormously influential as a lutenist in his time, and renowned as a virtuoso on the instrument.

==Life==
He was born in Brassó, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (today Brașov in Romania), into a family of Transylvanian Saxon origin. An orphan, he was brought up by the Greff family and was educated in Buda at the court of John Zápolya. Bakfark remained there until 1540, though he possibly traveled to Italy once during this time.

Sometime in the 1540s he traveled to Paris, but, finding the position of lutenist to the king filled, he left for Jagiellon Poland in 1549, where he was employed as a court lutenist by Sigismund II Augustus. From then until 1566, he traveled extensively around Europe, with his renown increasing, but remained faithful to his employer in spite of numerous efforts by other monarchs to win him away; the riches bestowed on him by Sigismund may have affected his decision to remain attached to the court of Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius.

What happened to him in 1566 is not precisely known, but he clearly did something to provoke the wrath of the king, and scarcely had time to flee before Polish army troops ransacked his house and destroyed his possessions. After this, he lived for a while in Vienna and then returned to Transylvania, but not for long; in 1571 he moved to Padua in Italy, where he remained until his death during the plague of 1576.

As was common practice at the time, all the possessions of plague victims were destroyed by fire, so most of his manuscript music was lost.

==Music and influence==

While Bakfark almost certainly wrote an enormous amount of music, very little was printed: a commonly given reason was that it was simply too difficult for others to play. His surviving works include ten fantasies, seven madrigals, eight chansons, and fourteen motets—all in amazingly faithful polyphonic arrangements for lute alone. Additionally, he transcribed vocal motets by contemporary composers such as Josquin des Prez, Clemens non Papa, Nicolas Gombert, and Orlando di Lasso into arrangements for the lute.

<text>The puku (Kobus vardonii) is a medium-sized antelope found in wet grasslands in southern Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and more concentrated in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Nearly one-third of all puku are found in protected areas, zoos, and national parks due to their diminishing habitat.

==Description==
Puku stand about at the shoulder and weigh from . The puku is sandy brown in colour, with the underbelly a slightly lighter brown. The coat is rougher than that of the similar-sized southern reedbuck, lechwe or impala, or the smaller oribi. Males have horns which are ridge-structured, long, and lyre-shaped.

==Subspecies==

There are two subspecies, the Senga Puku (&quot;Kobus vardonii senganus&quot;) and the southern puku (&quot;Kobus vardonii vardonii&quot;).

==Ecology==
Puku are found almost exclusively in marshy grassland and dambos, where they eat grasses. The puku diet is flexible in regards to type of grasses consumed. There is little dietary competition with other bovids. This species is crepuscular, active in the early morning and late afternoon. When scared, puku repeat a shrill whistle sound. Females gather in herds of up to 20 individuals. During the rainy season, herds will come together for added safety, typically reaching around 50 females. Males hold territories and attempt to persuade herds of females to stay within their territories for as long as possible. In the wet season, due to large floods in their habitat they migrate to a higher elevation and in the dry season remain near water.

<text>Daniel Gregory Szetela (born June 17, 1987) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Morris Elite SC in USL League Two.

==Club career==
===Columbus Crew===
In 2002, Szetela entered USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy, graduating in May 2004. He then signed with Major League Soccer, but because he signed after the annual draft had taken place, his rights were made available to teams in a weighted lottery instead, with Columbus Crew ending up with his rights. His desire to play for his hometown club, the MetroStars, went unfulfilled. Joining in mid-season, Szetela appeared in eight regular season and two playoff games, while recording a solitary assist. In 2005, Szetela struggled to get on the field with the Crew. During 2006, he was beset by injury troubles and only saw four games for Columbus.

===Europe===
On August 31, 2007, Szetela was signed by Racing de Santander, in the Spanish Primera División. Szetela made his official debut with the Spanish club on November 14, in a scoreless draw against Málaga CF in the Copa del Rey. On January 29, 2008, Szetela was loaned out to Serie B side Brescia Calcio until June 30, 2008, with the option to purchase at the end. Szetela made his debut for Brescia Calcio on February 9, playing the last five minutes in a 4–2 comeback victory. He made ten appearances total in Serie B.

Szetela extended his loan to Brescia Calcio through June 2009 on July 18, 2008. He scored his first goal for Brescia, his first professional goal in league play, on October 18, 2008, against Triestina. He returned to Spain on July 13, 2009. However, the Spanish side decided against renewing his contract.

===D.C. United===
Szetela opted not to continue a career in Europe and returned to the States, signing a contract with Major League Soccer. His contract was picked up by D.C. United, who were second in the allocation order to sign returning U.S. international players.

After suffering a severe knee injury in training camp prior to the 2010 MLS Season, Szetela underwent a partial meniscectomy on February 3, 2010, to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee; however, it was unsuccessful. Shortly thereafter, on March 16, 2010, he was released by D.C. United.

===New York Cosmos===
He underwent a second failed operation in 2011 before having a third surgery later that year involving a meniscus transplant from a donor, which proved successful.

Following two years of rehabilitation, Szetela returned to organized soccer in 2013, joining Icon FC, who at the time competed in the Garden State Soccer League of the USASA, the fifth-tier of American soccer.

After impressing in U.S. Open Cup play with Icon FC, Szetela earned a tryout with New York Cosmos of the NASL. After a successful tryout, Szetela signed a contract with the Cosmos on July 1, 2013.

Szetela appeared in 13 games for the Cosmos during the 2013 season and scored his first goal with the Cosmos in a 4–0 victory against the Carolina Railhawks on October 12, 2013. Szetela was named to the NASL Team of the Week in Week 8 and 11 of the 2013 season. He was in the starting lineup for the 2013 NASL Soccer Bowl and helped the Cosmos capture their sixth NASL title of all time, defeating the Atlanta Silverbacks 1–0.

On January 7, 2014, Szetela signed a contract extension with the Cosmos.

During the 2014 Spring season, Szetela scored one goal in eight appearances for the club and was named to the Spring Week 8 NASL Team of the Week.

He scored the game-winning goal in the team&#x27;s 3–2 home victory over the Atlanta Silverbacks on September 13, 2014, earning NASL Team of the Week honors and scored again two weeks later in the team&#x27;s 1–1 draw with FC Edmonton while once again being named to the NASL Team of the Week for his performance.

He finished the 2014 regular season with three goals and one assist in 23 appearances (21 starts). Szetela finished the 2015 regular season with 29 appearances for the Cosmos.

After five years with the Cosmos, Szetela mulled retirement after the NASL suspended play for 2018.
After announcing that he would sign with NPSL side FC Motown in New Jersey, Danny instead re-signed with the Cosmos.

===Morris Elite SC===
Following the Cosmos hiatus during the NISA Spring 2021 season, Szetela signed with USL League Two side Morris Elite SC ahead of their inaugural season.

==International career==
In 2003, Szetela burst onto the world&#x27;s stage during the Under-17 World Cup in Finland. The second-youngest player on the United States roster, he started all four American games, scoring two goals. In 2005, he was called up to the U.S. U-20 national team for the 2005 2005 World Youth Championship in the Netherlands. He played two games in that tournament. On June 30, 2007, Szetela scored the opening goal in the United States&#x27; match against South Korea in the U-20 World Cup. Three days later he recorded two goals in a winning effort over Poland, the country of both his parents.

Szetela made his debut for the U.S. on October 17, 2007, as a late-match substitute against Switzerland, and set up Michael Bradley&#x27;s game-winning goal. The win snapped a five-game losing streak for the national team, and provided their first win over Switzerland in seven matches. For a while, Szetela, who has a Polish passport and speaks Polish, was unsure of his international allegiances, as his parents wanted him to play for Poland. However, after the former coach of Poland national team, Pawel Janas, stated publicly that &quot;in Poland we have 200 players like Szetela,&quot; he decided to play for the U.S. In July 2008, Szetela was named to the U.S. team that competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

==Personal life==
Szetela grew up in Clifton, New Jersey. His parents are Polish immigrants and the Szetela household was bilingual. His father Julian was an accomplished player in Poland before migrating to the U.S.

<doc id="1151493" wikidata="Q694687" url="?curid=1151493" title="Breitspurbahn">
<text>The Breitspurbahn (, ) was a railway system planned and partly surveyed by Nazi Germany. Its track gauge – the distance between the two running rails – was to be , more than twice that of the standard gauge used in western Europe. The railway was intended initially to run between major cities of the Greater Germanic Reich (the regime&#x27;s expanded Germany) and neighbouring states.

==History==
Since reparations due after World War I had to be paid, the German railway company Deutsche Reichsbahn lacked money for appropriate expansion and sufficient maintenance of their track network and rolling stock.

Commercial and civilian traffic increased due to economic stimulation after the rise of the NSDAP and Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power. Deutsche Reichsbahn was now faced with a serious capacity problem. As a result, in part driven by its military objectives, the government began to prepare plans to modernize the railway network and increase transport capacity. Hitler believed that the standard Stephenson gauge was obsolete and was too narrow for the full development of railways. Also, as Hitler envisioned the future German empire as essentially a land-based Empire, the new German railways were imagined as a land-based equivalent of the ocean liners and freighters connecting the maritime British Empire.

Hitler embraced a suggestion from Fritz Todt to build a new high-capacity &quot;Reichsspurbahn&quot; (imperial gauge railway) with notably increased gauge. Objections from railway experts – who foresaw difficulties in introducing a new, incompatible gauge (and proposed quadruple track standard gauge lines instead), and who could not imagine any use for the vast transport capacity of such a railway – were ignored, and Hitler ordered the &quot;Breitspurbahn&quot; to be built with initial lines between Hamburg, Berlin, Nuremberg, Munich and Linz.

The project engaged commercial partners Krauss-Maffei; Henschel; Borsig; Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie and Krupp, but did not develop beyond line planning and initial survey. Throughout World War II, 100 officials and 80 engineers continued to work on the project.

==Proposed routes==

Early plans for routes considered India, Iran, Syria, Vladivostok and Canada (via Bering Strait) as the ultimate goals of the railways, but by 1943 the planning was focused exclusively on European cities. Ukraine and the Volga Basin were seen as especially important targets, as these areas were viewed as the future granaries of Greater Germany, potentially through the &quot;settlement strings&quot;, or &quot;Siedlungsperlen&quot; of the proposed Wehrbauer settlements within the conquered territories, which would also be linked by the planned easternmost reaches of the Reichsautobahn freeway network. Due to mountainous terrain, the initial phase routes of Aachen-Paris and Budapest-Bucharest were drawn via Antwerp instead of Liège, and via Belgrade instead of the Hungary/Romania border respectively.

*East-West: Rostov - Donetsk - Poltava - Kiev - Lvov - Krakau - Kattowitz - Breslau - Cottbus - Welthauptstadt Germania (Berlin) - Hannover - Bielefeld - Ruhrgebiet - Aachen - Liège - Saint-Quentin - Paris
**Initially proposed the Flemish corridor as Aachen - Antwerp - Ghent - Paris
*North-Southeast: Hamburg - Wittenberge - Welthauptstadt Germania (Berlin) - Leipzig - Gotha - Bamberg - Nuernberg - Munich - Simbach am Inn - Linz - Vienna - Preßburg - Budapest - Bucharest - Varna/Burgas - Istanbul
**Initially proposed the Serbian corridor as Budapest - Belgrade - Bucharest
*North-South-Parallel: Welthauptstadt Germania (Berlin) - Dresden - Aussig - Prague - Iglau - Znaim - Vienna - Trieste - Rome
*East-West 2: Munich - Augsburg - Stuttgart - Karlsruhe - Metz - Reims - Paris - Marseille - Barcelona - Madrid

For further routes, see German version and Dutch version.

== Tracks ==
Originally proposed to run on a track, the &quot;Breitspurbahn&quot; was ultimately developed with a track gauge of , more than double the width of the common standard gauge track, and three times the width of the common semi-narrow metre gauge track. Planning called for a ballastless track (much as was developed 30 years later for San Francisco BART and 40 years later for German high-speed lines) which consisted of two parallel pre-stressed concrete &quot;walls&quot; sunk into the ground, joined at the top by a flat transverse slab. The rails were fixed on top of the &quot;walls&quot;, with an elastic material between rail and concrete. Because it did not have conventional railway sleepers, this track would also have formed an ideal road for maintenance and military purposes. The rails would be either , as on the Pennsylvania Railroad; tall) rails or proposed (height-width ratio of 1:1) rails. The passing loop length would be more than a mile (1 km).

==Vehicles==

===Locomotives===
Forty-one different locomotive designs were suggested by the industry partners. These ranged from classical steam locomotives through steam turbine, gas turbine-electric and diesel-hydraulic to electric locomotives. The designs ranged from 12 axles (UIC: 3′Fo3′, Whyte: 6-12-6) to 52 axles (UIC: 2′Fo′Fo′2′ + 5T5 + 5T5 + 2′Fo′Fo′2′, Whyte: 4-12-12-4 + 10-10 + 10-10 + 4-12-12-4). Power ranged from . All locomotives would have automatic couplers, ranged from Janney couplers to SA3 couplers. Several designs were short listed with passenger locomotives to be mainly electric and diesel-hydraulic with SA3 couplers, and freight locomotives to be mainly conventional steam with Janney couplers.

===Multiple units===
Diesel and electric multiple units of between five and eight coaches were proposed for shorter distance journeys. Despite being of somewhat lower standard, proposed designs included promenades, bars, lounges and large dining rooms.

===Carriages===

The proposal was that high-performance locomotives should pull 8-axle bi-level carriages with a length of , width of and height of . The carriages would have Dutch doors (with retractable staircase). The trains would be fitted with a restaurant, theatre, swimming pool, barbershop and sauna. The whole train would have a length of about , allowing a capacity of between 2000 and 4000 passengers, travelling at speeds of . Designs included:

* 1st/2nd class day car: 48 first class seats in 12 compartments, 144 second class seats in 24 compartments, bar, lounge, reading room, luggage compartments, 12 toilets.
* 3rd class day car: 460 seats in 56 compartments, lounge, 12 toilets.
* 1st/2nd class dining car: 130 seats at 24 tables, kitchen, pantry.
* 3rd class day car with dining room: 244 seats in 28 compartments, 176 seat dining room, kitchen, pantry.
* 1st/2nd class sleeping car: 16 first class beds in 16 cabins, 41 second class beds in 19 cabins, breakfast room, kitchen, washrooms, 10 toilets.
* 2nd class sleeping car: 104 beds in 104 cabins, washrooms, 12 toilets.
* 3rd class sleeping car: 264 beds in 44 cabins, breakfast room, kitchen, shower rooms, 10 toilets.
* Day/night car for Ost-Arbeiter: 480 seats in 52 cabins, kitchen, washrooms, staff room.
* Theatre car: 196-seat theatre.
* Observation car: 16 first class seats in four compartments, 32 second class seats in eight compartments, 160 third class seats in 20 compartments, galley, cold buffet, bar, observation deck.
* Mail car: mail storage and sorting, parcel space, crew room, space for 6 automobiles, dog kennels.
* Baggage car: baggage rooms, space for two automobiles, dog kennels, canteen, crew room, multiple 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, ammunition storage and gun crews.

After Nazi Germany collapsed, several super-broad-gauge railways were proposed, with track gauges ranging from . Locomotive options added nuclear-powered locomotives, and passenger carriages lengths ranging from . Most passenger carriages would have Dutch doors and a retractable boarding staircase, with some exceptions for low-level boarding only.

==In fiction==
A ride on Breitspurbahn is featured in the video game &quot;&quot;. The railway network is also mentioned in novels &quot;Fatherland&quot; and &quot;The Fuhrer&#x27;s Orphans&quot;.

An American version of the Breitspurbahn is depicted in the TV series &quot;Supertrain&quot;.

In the television series &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;, the titular train bears many similarities to the Breitspurbahn.

<text>Lake Alexandrina (Māori: &quot;Whakatukumoana&quot;) is a lake located in the Mackenzie Basin of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It lies immediately to the west of the much larger Lake Tekapo and further to the east of Lake Pukaki, located to the north of Lake Tekapo township. It is a shallow lake with distinct indications of glacial origin and is spring fed with an outlet on its eastern shore midway down the lake. The outlet feeds into a smaller lake, Lake MacGregor before feeding into Lake Tekapo described as “Opaque and milky blue” in colour. In the desert terrain of the Mackenzie Plains, Lake Alexandrina is considered as an “oasis of life”.
Lake Alexandrina is a Wildlife Refuge and a delight to a fisherman, well documented for its brown and rainbow trout and salmon.

==Geography==

Categorised as a Canterbury High County lake in the Mackenzie Basin, it lies a short distance from Lake Tekapo while also being connected to it. Lake Alexandrina is approached from the State Highway 8 via the Godley Peaks Road. The lake, located at an altitude of , covers an area of with width of and extending to a length of . Its shores are flat. The maximum water depth in the lake is reported to be . The lake catchment has landscape that provides for plentiful wildlife but also has extensive cultivation which brings in a lot of nutrients, enriching the lake&#x27;s with phosphorus.

The lake&#x27;s annual balance is contributed by surface streams: 5.72 million m3 (27%), overland flows: 1.11 million m3 (5%), ground water sources: 10.1 million m3 (48%) and precipitation: 4.11 million m3 (20%). The storage in the lake lasts four years.

==Chemical properties==

The lake has been classified as mesotrophic type. Chlorophyll levels of 0.4–3.8 mg/1 have recorded during observations carried out between November 1978 and March 1979. The total phosphorus at 1 m depth was 0.009–0.015 mg/L as measured in March 1979. The reasons attributed to high nutrient content and consequent high degree of phosphorus levels are due to nutrients entering from the lake catchment, underground sources, grazing on the periphery of the lake, human habitations around the lake, aerial spray and stocking in the trout-spawning streams.

==Ecology==
The lake catchment is biologically rich, with 45 species of birds, which include the Australasian crested grebe, shoveler and scaup. The Australian shoveller is a common bird seen in the lake area, as well as black swans and ducks. Six species of waterbirds have been recorded in total. Paradise shelducks flock here during the summer season, seeking sanctuary when they become flightless during their moult. Freshwater snails &quot;Potamopyrgus antipodarum&quot; have also been analysed in the basin area. For example, studies in 1994 found that there are more male snails in the lake&#x27;s shallow water than females, and that snails are sicker in shallow water than deep water.

In December 2021, the Department of Conservation reported that over 60 breeding pairs of Australasian crested grebes had established nests in the first 50 metres of the outlet stream, and urged holidaymakers to keep their distance, to avoid disturbing the birds.

===Vegetation===
The breeding of the &quot;Elodea canadensis&quot; species has been inhibited at Lake Alexandrina because of the steep slopes on the east and west sides of the lake, as well as turbulence caused by high winds of 10–14 m/s.

===Aqua fauna===
The lake has plentiful stocks of brown trout, rainbow trout and salmon, which are well known to fishing enthusiasts. The trout are not found in abundance because of overfishing and inadequate spawning duration. However, the fish do grow to a large size, especially the trout, each weighing as much as on an average. Some of prize catch could be of weight for rainbows and for brown variety trout (which generally are found along the shores of the lake where flies and insects abound).

==Conservation==
Lake Alexandrina is one of New Zealand&#x27;s Scenic Reserves, a valid Crown Protected Area.

;Threats
The threats to the lake waters that were identified in the 1980s were the regular occurrence of algal (&quot;Anabaena&quot;) blooms, which were a result of high nutrient levels of phosphorus, survival of wildlife, and recreational fishery. It was assessed by measurements that nearly 50% of the phosphorus was contributed by groundwater, with 32% from surface water inflows and only 3–9% from hut settlements. This resulted in poor quality of the lake waters and subsequently, measures to check the phosphorus content in the lake received priority attention of the Government of New Zealand.

;Conservation measures
In order to take adequate remedial measures to check the inflow of nutrients into the lake, which had raised the phosphorus content in the lake waters to unacceptable levels, in 1984, the &quot;Lake Alexandrina Steering Committee&quot; was set up which identified the problem areas causing deterioration of water quality as due to phosphorus as also from the hut settlements at the outlet and south end, and from agricultural sources. The Taranaki Catchment Commission and the Waitaki Catchment Commission, who examined this issue in 1987, also concluded that though the inflows exceeded outflows, but they did not contribute to the storage due to the high sediment contribution which vitiated the storage. Consequent to their study of recorded high total phosphorus levels causing the blooms and creating threats to wildlife and the recreational fisheries, the Commission prescribed interim management guidelines such as: Total cessation of aerial top dressing within of the eastern shore and of the western shore and around the flow sources into the lake; restrictions on fertiliser use for agriculture; access to streams for spawning activities and to establish a &quot;deer fence&quot; on the northern end of the wetland; stop all activities related to cultivation on the shores of the lake; stop building of the hut settlements around the lake; install individual household effluent storage or septic tanks; and diversion of sewage outside the catchment. These measures were implemented by the Mackenzie District Council under a District Plan 1997, under the title &quot;Lake Side Protection Area around Lake Alexandrina&quot;. Progressively implemented since 1985, the redeeming feature of these actions is that the heavy algal blooms of the 1980s are now infrequent and limited to a frequency occurrence of once in three years.

==Tourism==
In 1881, 10,000 trout were brought to Mackenzie country and released into Lake Alexandrina, as well as some other lakes, creeks and streams. After the trout grew and prospered, fishing licenses were issued. Lake Alexandrina, now known for its attraction to fisherman, has a small number of fisherman&#x27;s huts clustered at each end of the lake and near the outlet. Rowing boats are the only mode of transport on the lake as sail and motor boats are prohibited.

<text>The City of Hawkesbury is a local government area of New South Wales, Australia, located on the northern and north-western fringe of the Greater Sydney area, about north-west of the Sydney central business district. Hawkesbury City is named after the Hawkesbury River. Major suburbs in the City of Hawkesbury are Windsor, Richmond and Pitt Town. It is a member council of the Hawkesbury River County Council.

The mayor of the City of Hawkesbury is Cr. Sarah McMahon, a member of the Liberal Party.

== Suburbs and localities in the local government area ==
Suburbs and localities in the City of Hawkesbury are:
==History==
The original inhabitants of the Hawkesbury district were the Darug tribe of Aboriginals, also spelt as Dharug or Daruk. The river, which they called Derrubbin, was a focal point as a source of food and transport. The Darug people used the river to farm for fish, eels, water birds, and mussels. They also used the river as a mode of transport in bark canoes.

It was first settled by Europeans in 1794 in a bid to acquire arable land to feed the increasing population of the penal colony at Sydney. In April 1794, Lieutenant Governor Francis Grose submitted plans for the first 22 farms on the Hawkesbury River in the present Pitt Town Bottoms area. In June 1795, Lieutenant Governor William Paterson deployed troops to engage with Aboriginals inhabiting land along the Hawkesbury River.

By 1811 Governor Lachlan Macquarie established the five &quot;Macquarie Towns&quot; in the area. They are Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, Wilberforce and Pitt Town. Many of the early 19th century buildings still survive today. Ebenezer has the oldest surviving church and school building in Australia. Windsor District Council was formed in 1843 and disbanded in 1846. In 1871 the Borough Council of Windsor was founded and the Richmond Borough Council followed in 1872. The two councils amalgamated in 1949 to become the Municipality of Windsor. Colo Shire Council was established in 1906 and joined Windsor Municipal Council from 1 January 1981 to become Hawkesbury Shire Council. On 1 July 1989, Hawkesbury became a City.

On its creation in 1981, Hawkesbury was largely rural, but urban expansion within Sydney has since transformed the southern part of the area into dormitory suburbs. The northern part of the local government area still contains some farmlands and national parkland.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 Census, there were people in the Hawkesbury local government area. Of these, 49.8% were male and 50.2% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.8% of the population, which was 1.6% above the national average. The median age of people in the City of Hawkesbury was 39 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 19.1% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 16.6% of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 49.3% were married and 12.4% were either divorced or separated.

Population in the City of Hawkesbury between the 2001 Census and the 2006 Census decreased by 0.54%; and in the subsequent five years to the 2011 Census, population growth was 2.96%. Between the 2011 and 2016 Census, population increased by a further 1.04%. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, population growth in Hawkesbury local government area was significantly lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the City of Hawkesbury has been consistently marginally higher than the national average.

At the 2021 Census, the proportion of residents in the Hawkesbury local government area who stated their ancestry as Australian or English amounted to 80.8%, representing an increase from 62% in 2011. Many people from the Hawkesbury identified as having a Catholic (26.0%) or Anglican (19.3%) religious affiliation in 2021.

== Council ==
===Current composition and election method===
Hawkesbury City Council is composed of twelve councillors elected proportionally as one entire ward. All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor is elected by the councillors at the first meeting of the council. The most recent election was held on 4 December 2021, and the makeup of the council is as follows:

<doc id="1151508" wikidata="Q483069" url="?curid=1151508" title="English village">
<text>English villages are language education institutions which aim to create a language immersion environment for students of English in their own country.

The concept is run as a commercial venture in Spain, Italy, Poland, and Hungary and is quasi-governmental in South Korea (see below).

==Spain==
The first English Village experience was in July 2001 in Valdelavilla, Soria, Spain.

Valdelavilla has been recreated in cyberspace in the Second Life game, populated by English and Spanish avatars who all have English as a common language.

==Italy==
The first Italian English Village was in Umbria in 2005. The current village is in the Umbria region, in the Tevere valley.

==Poland==
The first Polish English Village program was launched in 2010 by Angloville and has since spread to a four locations in the East and South West of Poland. Both adult and junior programmes are organized.

The second English immersion programme in Poland, AngloBridge, opened in 2016, and courses primarily organised in the South and Centre of the country.

==Hungary==
Angloville Hungary was launched in 2014 with programmes branded &quot;language island&quot; organized near Budapest and lake Balaton, plus a summer junior programme near Győr.

==Romania==
Angloville Romania opened in 2015. Week-long language immersion programmes are held in the mountain resort of Bușteni in the Prahova valley, north of Bucharest.

==Turkey==
EEC-Anglo has been offering English Village projects since 2006. Intensive residential English programmes are organised in an isolated mountain-top venue near Istanbul

==South Korea==

English villages in South Korea provide a short-term immersion English experience in a live-in environment where only English is spoken. This is intended to promote English learning and to build students&#x27; Anglo-American cultural awareness. The first English village was opened in August 2004 in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do province. Additional English villages have been opened in both Gyeonggi-do and Seoul. As of September 2012, there are 32 of such mini towns in suburban areas.

English villages employ a mixture of foreign native speakers of English and fluent English-speaking Korean staff. They are intended to help students face the particular challenges of speaking English in the Korean context. Many families seek to improve their children&#x27;s English ability by sending them to expensive after-school programs and by sending them to study abroad in English-speaking countries. Study abroad results in a substantial amount of money leaving the country. The English villages are intended to reduce this loss, and make the immersion experience accessible to students from low-income families as well. However, many questions remain whether the English villages will be cost-effective. In fact, most have been privatized due to operating losses.

The English village concept is to be expanded in the near future as financially it has not been a complete failure. The government will begin to use money for projects like this in the future in addition to sending students on scholarships overseas, despite spending money on short term construction projects.

===Gyeonggi-do===
The English villages of Gyeonggi province are overseen by the Gyeonggi English Culture Foundation, a quasi-governmental body established on the initiative of provincial governor Son Hak-Gyu. The original Ansan Camp was spun off in 2007, and is currently leased to a Christian organization.

The much larger Paju Camp opened in 2006. In addition to the week-long residential programs, the facility also hosts many day visitors. Day visitors may be individuals, families, or large groups. English Village Paju Camp offers many special programs including a month-long vacation program, Family Programs, Military Programs, teacher training, and the Civil Servants Program.
In addition to the current villages, the foundation established another in Yangpyeong County in 2008. Thereafter, the foundation hopes to franchise the English village concept to other cities.

=== Current Developments ===

One Month Program (Vacation Intensive Program)

Two week programs were combined to form the One Month Program, the first of its kind in Korea. It is presented twice a year as a summer camp during July and winter camp during January. It was highly successful with students returning. This was a result of highly motivated teachers.

Long Term Program (LTP)

The Long Term Program is a 10-week intensive adult program that offers a great opportunity to practice and enhance their English skills in and outside of class by speaking with foreign teachers around English Village. The students live there so they are encouraged to participate in the many extracurricular activities with the foreigners that are in and outside of English Village.

===Ansan===
Ansan English Village was established in 2004 on Daebu Island on the coast of the Yellow Sea. Built on the site of a former government complex, the campus covers an area of 184,800 m2, including athletic facilities. It has approximately 50 full-time staff. It employs a content-based curriculum, with English-medium courses on topics including world music and dance, global awareness, cooking, and broadcasting.

The village provides weekend and weekday programs, with a month-long program planned for school vacations. The weekend program works with families, training parents in how to encourage their children to speak English. The weekday program takes in about 200 middle school students per week, drawn each week from a different school in Gyeonggi province. The village is currently run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, although religion is not taught.

===Seoul===
Seoul English Village was contracted by the Seoul government to a consortium of companies including Herald Media publisher of the &quot;Korea Herald&quot; English newspaper. Herald Media manages the daily operations, curriculum development, and implementation of programs at SEV. It opened in late November 2004. The campus, located in Songpa-gu in southeastern Seoul, has an area of 16,500 m2.

===Other Areas===
English Villages have opened in other provinces, including: Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangnam-do and in various cities in Taiwan. Another English Village is set to open in Jeju-do. There is also the English village in the Busan, it is called the Busan Global Villager.

<text>Dooley Field at Sanford Stadium is the on-campus playing venue for football at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, United States (also known as UGA). The 93,033-seat stadium is the ninth-largest American football stadium in the NCAA (and in the United States), and the 17th-largest such stadium in the world. Games played there are said to be played &quot;between the hedges&quot; due to the field being surrounded by privet hedges, which have been a part of the design of the stadium since it opened in 1929. The current generation of hedges were planted in 2024 (Completed on May 4, 2024, as an NIL fundraising event.) after the originals were taken out to accommodate the football tournaments for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The stadium is often considered one of college football&#x27;s &quot;best, loudest, and most intimidating atmospheres&quot;.
Whereas many college football stadiums have artificial playing surfaces, Sanford Stadium from the outset had, and continues to have, a natural grass surface, planted with Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass.

==History==
The stadium is named for Dr. Steadman Vincent Sanford, an early major force behind UGA athletics. Sanford arrived at the University of Georgia as an English instructor in 1903. He later became the faculty representative to the athletics committee and would eventually become president of the university and chancellor of the entire University System of Georgia. In 1911, he moved the university&#x27;s football venue from its first location, Herty Field, to a location at the center of campus which was named Sanford Field in his honor.

In those early years of football, Georgia played a series of controversial games against in-state rival Georgia Tech. Sanford Field was too small to accommodate the large crowds, forcing Georgia to travel to Tech&#x27;s Grant Field in Atlanta every year. Sanford wanted Georgia to have a venue that would equal Tech&#x27;s, and the &quot;final straw&quot; came in 1927 when UGA&#x27;s undefeated (9–0) team traveled to Tech and lost 12–0. It was alleged that Tech watered the field all night to slow UGA&#x27;s running backs. Afterwards, Sanford vowed to &quot;build a stadium bigger than Tech&quot;, and play the game at Athens every other year.

To fund his vision, Sanford had an idea that members of the athletic association would sign notes guaranteeing a bank loan to fund the stadium construction. Those guarantors would be granted lifetime seats. The response was overwhelming, and in 1928 a loan of $150,000 supported by fans and alumni allowed construction to begin on a stadium whose total cost was $360,000.

Near the existing Sanford Field was a low area between the historic North Campus and the Science Campus (to the south) with a small creek (Tanyard Creek) running through it, creating a clearly preferable choice for the location of the new stadium. This natural valley containing Tanyard Creek would result in reduced costs, as stands could be built on the rising sides of the hill, while the creek could be enclosed in a concrete culvert, on top of which the field would be constructed. The architect for the stadium was TC Atwood of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where North Carolina&#x27;s Kenan Memorial Stadium had just been completed with a similar design. The 30,000-seat stadium was built in large part with convict labor, as were many public works projects of that era.

While the location was, then as now, preferable for construction, the result is an uphill walk in any direction leaving the stadium.

The stadium was completed on time, and UGA convinced perennial powerhouse Yale, which has historically maintained close ties with UGA, to be their first opponent in the new stadium. (This also was Yale&#x27;s first ever football game played in the South.) On October 12, 1929, a capacity crowd of over 30,000 paid $3 per ticket to watch the Bulldogs, under coach Harry Mehre, beat Yale 15–0 in Sanford Stadium&#x27;s dedication game. The crowd was at the time the largest to witness a college football game in the South, and governors from all nine southern states also were in attendance. Yale donated its half of the game receipts to UGA to help pay off the construction loans, which would subsequently be completely repaid in just five years. Dr. Sanford also was at this game, and attended many Georgia games at the stadium named in his honor until his death on September 15, 1945.

Sanford Stadium&#x27;s hedges have encircled the field since the stadium&#x27;s first game against Yale in 1929. The idea to put hedges around the field came from the Business Manager of the UGA Athletic Department, Charlie Martin. Martin claimed to have received inspiration for the idea during a visit to the Rose Bowl, where he saw the hedge of roses in that stadium. Roses were not a suitable choice for the climate in Athens, so privet hedges were used instead. Six other SEC stadiums now have hedges, making them no longer unique to Sanford Stadium, but they remain an important symbol at UGA.

There is a disagreement as to the exact type of hedge planted at Sanford Stadium. The UGA Media Guide claims that the hedge is an &quot;English privet hedge&quot;. A county extension agent in Athens, however, claims online that the hedge is composed of &quot;Chinese&quot; privet, &quot;Ligustrum sinense&quot;.

In addition to being a cosmetic touch, the hedges have proven to be an effective (though perhaps unintended) measure of crowd control. While not apparent in photos, the hedges are growing around a chain link fence which stops people who try to push through to the field. Even though a major traffic path to exit the stadium from both stands runs directly alongside the hedges, fans have only stormed the field and torn down the goalposts once in the entire history of Sanford Stadium. This occurred after the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on Oct. 7, 2000.

In May 2019, university officials announced that the playing surface of Sanford Stadium would be named in honor of former long time Bulldog head coach and athletic director Vince Dooley. Official dedication of Dooley Field took place in a pregame ceremony on the Bulldogs&#x27; 2019 home opener on September 7.

On September 21, 2019, Sanford Stadium would set an attendance record of 93,246 in the Bulldogs victory against #7 Notre Dame. Aluminum bleachers were added to raise the capacity of the stadium by 500 due to the agreement between both UGA and the University of Notre Dame to allocate 8,000 visitor tickets for each game in the home and away series.

==Stadium expansions==
The original stadium consisted of the lower half of the current facility&#x27;s grandstand seats. In 1940, field-level lights were added, and Georgia played its first night game against Kentucky to a 7–7 tie. The stadium&#x27;s first major expansion took place in 1949, with the addition of 6,000 seats on the south side, bringing total capacity to 36,000.

During the 1960s, many universities in the South were significantly expanding their stadiums, and Georgia was no different. Soon after the arrival of head coach Vince Dooley in 1964, UGA began updating Sanford Stadium, removing the field-level lighting (which obstructed views from the stands) and adding 7,621 bleacher seats in the end zones, which brought total capacity to 43,621. Architects Heery and Heery of Atlanta were then hired to plan a major expansion. This expansion planning was very tricky, since by that time the stadium was encroached by academic buildings. The plans went forward, however, and the grandstand seats were double-decked in 1967 without the need to demolish or alter any of the surrounding buildings. In addition to the new upper decks, this first major addition included a new pressbox and club seating. In total, 19,640 seats were added to the stadium (bringing total capacity to 59,000), at a cost of $3 million. The new addition was christened with a victory over Mississippi State in 1967.

In 1981, the east endzone was enclosed at a cost of $11.5 million, turning the stadium into a &quot;horseshoe&quot; and eliminating the free view enjoyed by the &quot;Track People&quot;. This addition added 19,000 seats, bringing total stadium capacity to 82,122. The first game in the newly expanded stadium was on September 5, 1981, against Tennessee, with Georgia delivering a 44–0 drubbing.

Lights were re-installed in the stadium in 1981. This time, the lights were not located at field level, but built above the upper level, thus not obscuring views of the field. The first game under the &quot;new lights&quot; was a 13–7 victory against Clemson on September 6, 1982.

In 1991, a portion of the west endzone was enclosed, creating a &quot;partial bowl&quot; around the lower level of Sanford Stadium. The west stands could not be completely enclosed due to the proximity of Gillis Bridge (usually called &quot;Sanford Bridge&quot;), a major campus transportation artery, to the stadium. This expansion cost $3.7 million and added 4,205 new seats, bringing total capacity to 85,434.

30 luxury suites were added above the south stands in 1994, and were expanded to 50 suites in 2000. These expansions cost a total of $18 million, and raised total capacity to 86,520.

In 2003, another upper deck was added to the north side of the stadium. It added 5,500 new seats at a cost of $25 million, bringing total stadium capacity to 92,058. Most of these &quot;upper-upper deck&quot; seats are reserved for the fans of the visiting team.

In 2005, installation of a new video display above the west end zone was completed. Ribbon boards were also added along the sides of the stadium. These additions, constructed and maintained by Daktronics, established Sanford Stadium as one of the most visually media intensive venues in the SEC.

The stadium reached its capacity of 92,746 in 2004, when 27 SkySuites were added to the north side of the stadium at a cost of $8 million.

The video board installed from 2005 underwent a $1.4 million overhaul before the 2011 season. The screen size expanded from 25×46 feet to the full scoreboard size of the 52×76 feet. The new video board has full high definition (HD) capability.

On February 14, 2017, the UGA Athletic Board approved a $63 million expansion to renovate the west side of the stadium. The approved design relocated the locker room from the east side to the west side and added a new plaza and recruiting pavilion. Construction began following the 2017 season and was officially opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 31, 2018, a day before Georgia&#x27;s first home game of the 2018 season. In 2019, the floodlighting system was upgraded to a state-of-the-art LED system, which cost around $950,000. The first game that demonstrated them was the Notre Dame game on September 21, 2019.

In 2022 Georgia announced renovations to be completed by the 2024 season. The renovation included the expansion of the 100-level south sideline concourse; the creation of the 50 Yard Line Club; expansion of gate 9; more restrooms; and a new press box with premium seating offerings. The renovation added 287 seats to have a total of 93,033.

==1996 Summer Olympics==
The stadium played host to the Olympic medal competition of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s association football at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Because the required dimensions of an association football field are wider than those of an American football field, the hedges surrounding the field had to be removed. This proved to be a controversial measure, as it had not been general public knowledge that the hedges would have to be removed to accommodate the Olympic football competition. In preparation for this necessity, cuttings were taken from the original hedges, three years prior to the Olympics, and cultivated at a secret, off-campus site. It was later discovered that this &#x27;secret site&#x27; were in fact two sites - one away at R.A. Dudley Nurseries in Thomson, Georgia and another away at Hackney Nursery in Quincy, Florida; both run by alumni. During the Olympics, Nigeria and the United States won the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s football gold medals, respectively, at the hedge-less stadium. Once the Olympics were over, the newly grown hedges were transplanted from the two nurseries to the stadium. Sanford Stadium told the United States Football Federation it would not be interested in future FIFA World Cup matches being held at the stadium, with an American-held tourney being held 2026, though Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will host matches and was designed to do so.

==Features==
* Georgia&#x27;s deceased Uga mascots are entombed in a mausoleum in the southwest corner of the stadium.
* Sanford Stadium is one of the few college stadiums, and one of only two in the Southeastern Conference, in which the football field is oriented to face east–west as opposed to north–south (the other is Kroger Field). Many of UGA&#x27;s opponents have found it difficult to see as the west end zone is still open and the sun shines in the players&#x27; faces.
* Until the end of the era of rail travel, executives of the Central of Georgia Railway Co. would park the company president&#x27;s luxury office rail car on the tracks overlooking the end zone for an excellent view of the spectacle. With food served on china by white-coated porters to the Central of Georgia executives and their guests, the rail car &quot;Atlanta&quot; could be considered Sanford Stadium&#x27;s original luxury skybox.
* In the 1970s, a multitude of fans began watching games from the railroad tracks that overlooked the end zone. These &quot;Track People&quot;, as they came to be known, were able to watch the game for free and became a tradition. The 1981 expansion, however, enclosed the end zone stands and eliminated the view of the field, thus ending the tradition.
* Georgia&#x27;s fans have only rushed the field and torn down the goal posts once in the stadium&#x27;s history. It happened on October 7, 2000, after the Bulldogs beat rival Tennessee for the first time since 1988. This statistic is usually credited to the fact that the hedges serve not only cosmetic purposes, but also help with crowd control. Aiding this cause is that the hedges surround, and largely conceal, a low chain-link fence running through their branches around the circumference of the field.
* Through the 1994 season, the field only had the basic markings required for play. There weren&#x27;t any logos at midfield or writing in the end zone, as had become commonplace in many stadiums.
* The goal line markers on each endzone are marked with the famous oval &quot;G&quot; logo.

<text>SAMPLE history is a mnemonic acronym to remember key questions for a person&#x27;s medical assessment. The SAMPLE history is sometimes used in conjunction with vital signs and OPQRST. The questions are most commonly used in the field of emergency medicine by first responders during the secondary assessment. It is used for alert (conscious) people, but often much of this information can also be obtained from the family or friend of an unresponsive person. In the case of severe trauma, this portion of the assessment is less important. A derivative of SAMPLE history is AMPLE history which places a greater emphasis on a person&#x27;s medical history.

==Meaning==
The parts of the mnemonic are:

*S – Signs/Symptoms (Symptoms are important but they are subjective.) 
*A – Allergies
*M – Medications
*P – Past Pertinent medical history 
*L – Last Oral Intake (Sometimes also Last Menstrual Cycle.) 
*E – Events Leading Up To Present Illness / Injury

==See also==
*OPQRST
*ABC (medicine)

<doc id="1151523" wikidata="Q483725" url="?curid=1151523" title="Azerbaijani manat">
<text>The manat (ISO code: AZN; sign: ₼; abbreviation: m) is the currency of Azerbaijan. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;gapiks&quot;.

The first iteration of the currency emerged in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and its successor, the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, with the issues happening in 1919–1923. The currency underwent hyperinflation, and was eventually substituted by the Transcaucasian ruble, which, in its turn, was converted to the Soviet ruble.

When Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, it substituted the Soviet ruble with the manat, which also went through a period of high inflation in the first years, rendering the coinage obsolete. The current manat in circulation exists since the redenomination in 2006, when old manats (AZM) were substituted with lower face values and new design. The currency has mostly been pegged to the US dollar, at what is now the rate of ₼1.70 to US$1.

The Azerbaijani manat symbol was added to Unicode as in 2013. A lowercase m was used previously, and may still be encountered when the manat symbol is unavailable.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;manat&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;monēta&quot; and the Russian word &quot;монета&quot; (&quot;moneta&quot;) meaning &quot;coin&quot;. It was used as the name of the Soviet currency in Azeri () and in Turkmen.

== First manat, 1919–1923 ==

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and its successor, the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic issued their own currency between 1919 and 1923. The currency was called the manat (منات) in Azerbaijani and the ruble (рубль) in Russian, with the denominations written in both languages (and sometimes also in French) on the banknotes. The manat replaced the first Transcaucasian ruble at par, and was replaced by the second Transcaucasian ruble after Azerbaijan became part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic. No subdivisions were issued, and the currency only existed as banknotes.

=== Banknotes ===
The Democratic Republic issued notes in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 manats, whilst the Soviet Socialist Republic issued notes in denominations of 5, 100, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, 1 million, and 5 million manats.

== Second manat, 1992–2006 ==
The second manat was introduced on 15 August 1992. It had the ISO 4217 code AZM and replaced the Russian ruble which itself replaced the Soviet ruble at a rate of RUR 10 to 1 manat.

From early 2002 to early 2005, the exchange rate was fairly stable (varying within a band of 4,770–4,990 manats per US dollar). Starting in the spring of 2005 there was a slight but steady increase in the value of the manat against the US dollar; the reason most likely being the increased flow of petrodollars into the country, together with the generally high price of oil on the world market. At the end of 2005, one dollar was worth 4,591 manats. Banknotes below 100 manats had effectively disappeared by 2005, as had the gapik coins.

=== Coins ===

Coins were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 gapiks, dated 1992 and 1993. Although brass and cupronickel were used for some of the 1992 issues, later issues were all in aluminium. These coins were rarely used in circulation.

=== Banknotes ===
The following banknotes were issued for this currency
* 1, 5, 10, 250 manats (all first issued on 15 August 1992)
* 50, 100, 500, 1,000 manats (all first issued in early 1993)
* 10,000 manats (first issued in August 1994)
* 50,000 manats (first issued in May 1996)
== Third manat, 2006 ==

On 1 January 2006, a new manat (ISO 4217 code AZN, also called the &quot;manat (national currency)&quot;) was introduced at a ratio of 1 new manat to 5,000 old manats. From 1 October 2005, prices were indicated both in new manats and in old manats to ease the transition. Coins denominated in qəpik, which had not been used from 1993 onward due to inflation, were reintroduced with the re-denomination. The former manat (ISO code 4217 AZM) remained in use through to 31 December 2006.

=== Symbol ===
The new banknotes and Azerbaijani manat symbol, ₼, were designed by Robert Kalina in 2006, and the symbol was added to Unicode (U+20BC) in 2013, after failed addition proposals between 2008 and 2011. The final Azerbaijani Manat symbol design was inspired by the design of the Euro sign (€), based on an initial proposal by Mykyta Yevstifeyev, and resembles a single-bar Euro sign rotated 90° clockwise. The manat symbol is displayed to the right of the amount in Azeri and Russian.

=== Code ===
The new manat was initially assigned the code AYM on being added to the ISO 4217 standard on 1 June 2005, with an effective date of 1 January 2006. However, this was removed and replaced by AZN on 13 October 2005 as it did not comply with the ISO 4217 currency coding standardization rules (which state that currency codes must begin with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the relevant country).

=== Coins ===
Coins in circulation are 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 gapiks.
Most coins closely resemble the size and shape of various euro coins. Most notably the bimetallic 50 gapik (similar to the €2 coin) and the 10 gapik (Spanish flower, like the 20 euro cent coin). Coins were first put into circulation during January 2006 and do not feature a mint year.

=== Banknotes ===
Banknotes in circulation are ₼1, ₼5, ₼10, ₼20, ₼50, ₼100, ₼200, and ₼500. They were designed by Austrian banknote designer Robert Kalina, who also designed the current banknotes of the euro and the Syrian pound. The notes look quite similar to those of the euro, and the choice of motifs was inspired by the euro banknotes.

In 2009, the Azərbaycan Milli Bankı (National Bank of Azerbaijan) was renamed the Azərbaycan Respublikasının Mərkəzi Bankı (Central Bank of Azerbaijan). In 2010, the ₼1 banknote was issued with the new name of the issuing bank, in 2012 a ₼5 banknote was issued with the new name of the issuing bank and in 2017 a 100₼ banknote dated 2013 was issued with the new name of the issuing bank.

In 2011 Azerbaijan&#x27;s Ministry of Finance announced it was considering issuing notes of ₼2 and ₼3 as well as notes with values larger than ₼100. In February 2013, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan announced it would not introduce larger denomination notes until at least 2014.

In 2018, a ₼200 banknote was issued to commemorate Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s 95th birthday.

Redesigned ₼1, ₼5, and ₼50 banknotes were introduced in 2021, preserving the same motifs but with updated designs. These circulate in parallel with existing notes.

A new commemorative ₼500 banknote was introduced in 2021.

<doc id="1151524" wikidata="Q4634" url="?curid=1151524" title="Lake Coleridge">
<text>Lake Coleridge () is in inland Canterbury, New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located northwest of Methven and has a surface area of . The lake is situated in an over-deepened valley formed by a glacier over 20,000 years ago in the Pleistocene era. It currently has no natural outflows. There is a small settlement at the lake.

== Ecology ==
Early colonial explorers found the shores of the lake covered in mānuka (or kānuka), kōwhai, cabbage trees, flax and general swamp plants. The lake was also surrounded by southern rātā trees and native beech trees. The lake itself was fairly lacking in aquatic plants because of a lack of nutrients. It was known for a population of large eels.

Human activity has significantly changed the ecology. Colonial settlers introduced game fish, including rainbow trout, brown trout, Atlantic salmon and Chinook salmon. Changing water levels caused by the operation of the Coleridge Power Station killed most of the kānuka in 1914 and rata in 1923. In modern times a mixture of native and introduced plants surround the lake, including matagouri, broom, gorse, briar, coprosma and biddi-biddi.

== History ==
=== Pre-history ===
The area of the lake was formed by glacial erosion, probably during the Waimaungan, Waimean and Otiran glaciations. The lake sits close to multiple geological fault-lines, including the Porters Pass Fault, the Cass Fault and the Blue Hill Fault.

=== Māori ===
There is evidence of Māori activity in the area dating back potentially as far as the 13th century. Some nearby archaeological campfires and moa bones were carbon-dated to between 1340 and 1420 AD. Although the area was initially thickly forested, large fires destroyed most of the vegetation between 1200 and 1400. Later, the lake became an important stopping place for coastal tribes making the difficult journey between the east and west coasts to obtain pounamu: the lake’s abundant eels, weka and water fowl could be used to replenish stocks on the long journey.

=== Colonisation and modern times ===

The lake was named by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, on a sketch map prepared in early 1849. The name commemorates two early members of the Canterbury Association, Edward Coleridge and William Coleridge, who were first cousins and both nephews of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Two other members of the Coleridge family joined the Canterbury Association in June 1851, after the lake had been named: John Taylor Coleridge (a brother of Edward), and John Coleridge, one of John Taylor&#x27;s sons.

The lake is the site of one of the country&#x27;s earliest hydroelectric schemes, the Coleridge Power Station, initially completed in 1914 and built mainly to supply power to Christchurch. The project makes use of the difference in altitude between the lake and river (the lake is higher). Both the Harper and Wilberforce rivers have had some of their flow diverted into the lake, with up to 100% of the Harper&#x27;s flow diverted for the power station. The power station is still operating today.

The lake was the epicentre of a 6.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on 26 June 1946.

<text>Gustav Adolf Church () or the Scandinavian Seamen&#x27;s Church () is a historical building located in Park Lane, Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It consists of a church, built between 1883 and 1884, and an attached minister&#x27;s house, and provides a centre for the Liverpool International Nordic Community. The combined church and minister&#x27;s house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.

==History==

During the later part of the 19th century, large numbers of Scandinavian emigrants were passing through Liverpool, and there was a need to serve their spiritual needs. The first Scandinavian priest was appointed in 1870, who visited the emigrants in ships and boarding houses. There was perceived to be a need for a permanent centre. The commission to design a church and minister&#x27;s house was gained by W. D. Caröe, whose father, Anders Kruuse Caröe, was the Danish Consul in the city. It was Caröe&#x27;s first independent commission to design a church. Building started in 1883 and was completed the following year, at a cost of £15,000 (). During the 1960s the interior of the church was divided horizontally, when the gallery was removed and a mezzanine floor was added. This was to provide an area for social activity, between the basement and the church itself. At the same time the minister&#x27;s house was converted from a single-storey building to one with two storeys. Further changes were made in the early 1990s. The lower area was converted into a community meeting room with a kitchen, a café, and other facilities.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building is constructed in red brick, with a roof of tiles and copper sheathing, and consists of a church with a minister&#x27;s house attached to the southeast. The entrance front on Park Lane is in seven bays, and is in two and three storeys with basements. The central bay consists of a three-storey stair tower, containing windows with pointed arches, and surmounted by a lead-covered spire. At the midpoint of the spire are lucarnes with wooden bargeboards. To the right of this, the middle of the three bays rises to a greater height, and has a crowstepped gable containing three stepped lancet windows. The windows in the ground floor of these three bays have segmental heads, those in the middle storey have pointed heads, and the two lateral bays contain quatrefoil windows. Behind the gable, and rising to a greater height is an octagonal lantern. Around this are four gablets, and on its roof are four small dormers. The lantern is surmounted by a lead finial and cross. The dormers and gablets are decorated with Scandinavian carvings. To the left of the central tower is a modern entrance porch, and to the left of this is the two-storey minister&#x27;s house, which contains a crowstepped gable on its left side.

===Interior===

The lower floor contains a meeting room, a kitchen, bedrooms, toilet facilities, showers, an office and a television room. The upper floor, under the central octagonal lantern, comprises the church. Inside the church are five plaster reliefs by Robert Anning Bell. These originally formed a reredos, but are now hung separately in the church. Also in the church are two sculptures by the local sculptor, Arthur Dooley, which depict Christ, and the Madonna.

<text>Igor Vitalyevich Simutenkov (; born 3 April 1973 in Moscow) is a Russian football coach and a former player. Currently, he works as assistant manager at Zenit Saint Petersburg.

== Club career ==

Simutenkov started his pro career in the old Soviet league with Dynamo Moscow in 1990. He spent the next five years with Dynamo, the last three in the Russian league, which he led in scoring with 21 goals in 1994. A transfer to Serie A&#x27;s Reggiana followed, and Simutenkov spent the next five seasons in Italy (the last with Bologna), scoring a total of only 23 goals. He clinched the promotion to Serie A during the 1995-96 season with Carlo Ancelotti as manager.

In 1999, Simutenkov transferred to Spanish club Tenerife, and spent three uneventful seasons there. He signed with the Kansas City Wizards in 2002, becoming Major League Soccer&#x27;s first Russian player. Igor scored four goals in his first season (plus one in playoffs), seven in his second (plus two in playoffs), before missing a big chunk of the third with an injury, ending with a solitary goal in league play. He scored the golden goal in the final of the 2004 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, but was released by the Wizards following the 2004 season, at which time he returned to Russia and signed with Rubin.

At the end of season 2005, while made only 3 appearances for Rubin, Simutenkov declared his retirement from professional football. He told that he couldn&#x27;t perform at the high level because of a few serious permanent injuries. However, in 2006 he was included in the squad of FC Dynamo Voronezh, a Second Division side.

Simutenkov is also known for the famous Simutenkov-case in which the European Court of Justice acknowledged the direct effect of the partnership-agreement between the European Communities and Russia. In this judgment Spanish nationality-clauses for non-EU footballers were found in breach with Community law.

== International career ==

Simutenkov has scored nine goals in 20 caps for the Russian national team, playing in Euro 96, but his last appearance came in 1998.

He was part of the Russia squad that won the 2009 Legends Cup.

== Coaching career ==
In 2007, he managed a Russian Second Division team FC Torpedo-RG. From 2007 till the end of 2009 he was a coach of Russia 1993-born youth team. On 18 December 2009 he was appointed an assistant coach at FC Zenit Saint Petersburg with Luciano Spalletti as the head coach.

<text>Mushezib-Marduk (reigned 693 BC–689 BC), Chaldean prince chosen as King of Babylon after Nergal-ushezib.

He led the Babylonian populace in revolt against Assyria and King Sennacherib in 689 BC, with the support of Elam and King Humban-nimena (who was attacked by the Babylonians and the Assyrians only years before), at the Battle of Halule. It is not clear who won this battle, since both sides claimed victory, and all rulers remained on their thrones, but as the Assyrians subsequently retreated, they are likely to have suffered the greatest losses.

Mushezib-Marduk lost his ally when the Elamite king Humban-nimena suffered a stroke later that same year, an opportunity King Sennacherib quickly seized by attacking Babylon, and eventually capturing it after a nine-month siege. To avenge the death of his son, whom the Babylonians had effectively killed when they handed him over to the Elamites in 694 BC, Sennacherib pillaged and burned Babylon, tore down its walls, and even diverted the Euphrates into the city. During the Sack of Babylon, Mushezib-Marduk was most likely murdered.

<text>Cary Augustus Hardee (November 13, 1876 – November 21, 1957) was an American educator, lawyer, legislator, and banker who served as the 23rd governor of Florida.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Born in Taylor County, Florida, he spent most of his life in Live Oak, Florida. He was a teacher until 1900 when he was admitted to the bar and began practicing law. Additionally, he was a banker, establishing the First National Bank of Live Oak in 1902 and later serving as its president. He also organized the Mayo State Bank and was president of the Branford State Bank.

=== Political career ===
In 1905 he became the state&#x27;s attorney for the Third Judicial District. He served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1915 to 1919, and was Speaker of the Florida House.

=== Gubernatorial campaign issues ===
Hardee identified his positions on the issues of better and more efficient government, taxation, waterways and roads, agriculture, and veterans&#x27; affairs in a 1920 newspaper article.

=== Governorship ===
He took office as governor on January 4, 1921. During his term, the state adopted constitutional amendments that reapportioned the legislature and prohibited the levying of state income and inheritance taxes along with starting the first state gasoline tax. Six counties were created during his tenure as governor. He also halted the practice of leasing state prisoners out to private businesses, following the death of Martin Tabert. During his term as governor, electrocution became a legal method of execution in Florida.

Hardee was less willing to spend state funds than his predecessor, the populist Sidney Johnston Catts. During his tenure, the state cut the budgets of all three of Florida&#x27;s state universities - the University of Florida, the Florida State College for Women, and Florida A&amp;M University. Hardee particularly targeted Florida A&amp;M, which due to segregation only served African-American students. Since he believed a more educated black populace would be more likely to leave the state in search of better opportunities, he instructed his appointees to the Florida Board of Control to abolish the liberal arts program at the school and convert it into a purely vocational college. FAMU president Nathan B. Young resisted these efforts, but was eventually forced to resign; in response, students at FAMU staged a violent strike that led to the destruction of multiple campus buildings.

He offered to send in National Guard troops in response to the Rosewood Massacre but the local sheriff refused the offer.

=== Post-governorship ===
Hardee left office on January 6, 1925. He ran for governor again in 1932, but lost the Democratic primary.

He was a banker in Live Oak until his death in 1957.

== Honors and memorials ==
Hardee County, Florida is named in his honor.

<text>Andreas Ivanschitz (; born 15 October 1983) is an Austrian retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

During his 18-year career as a player, Ivanschitz played for Rapid Wien, Red Bull Salzburg, Panathinaikos, 1.FSV Mainz 05, Levante, Seattle Sounders FC and Viktoria Plzen.

A full international since 2003, he represented Austria at Euro 2008.

==Club career==
Born in Eisenstadt, Ivanschitz began his football career as a youth in his town&#x27;s local team called ASK Baumgarten, where he spent nine years. Soon, Rapid Wien scouts found out about his talent and in 1998, he signed his first professional contract with the Austrian champions. He was only 16 years old when he wore his team&#x27;s shirt during an Austrian Cup match against Ranshofen on 26 October 1999. His first official League match was in 2000 against Wüstenrot Salzburg. In 177 games for Rapid Wien, Ivanschitz scored 27 times, winning the Austrian Championship title in 2004–05. In 2003, he was elected &quot;Austrian Footballer of the Year.&quot;

In January 2006, Ivanschitz transferred to Red Bull Salzburg and then to Greek Super League club Panathinaikos in August 2006 on a two-year loan. On 20 June 2008, Ivanschitz agreed on a permanent deal with Panathinaikos.

After three years in Greece with Panathinaikos he agreed on 18 July 2009 on a two-year loan with Mainz 05 with the view to a two-year permanent contract in the summer of 2011. Mainz took advantage of this contract option prematurely, and signed Ivanschitz permanently in January 2011.

On 10 June 2013, Ivanschitz left Mainz for Levante. He scored his first goal in La Liga on 31 August, the winner with the last kick of a 2–1 home win over Rayo Vallecano. He finished his first season in Spain with three goals from 29 games, the last being in a 2–0 win over city rivals Valencia on 10 May.

On 4 August 2015, he signed with Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer. After suffering from an injury his debut was postponed to 13 September where he assisted a late Obafemi Martins goal to tie up the game against San Jose Earthquakes. Ivanschitz converted Seattle&#x27;s second kick from the spot in the 2016 MLS Cup penalty shootout, which the Sounders eventually won after six rounds, securing their first MLS Cup Title.

==International career==
Ivanschitz made his debut for Austria in a February 2003 friendly match against Greece, coming on as a substitute for Markus Weissenberger. He was also a participant at the UEFA Euro 2008. He has earned 69 caps for Austria and has scored 12 goals.

==Personal life==
Ivanschitz comes from a musical family and plays various musical instruments in his spare time. He is a part of the Burgenland Croat community. Ivanschitz&#x27;s son Ilia, is also a footballer who currently plays for Red Bull Salzburg.

<doc id="1151539" wikidata="Q424277" url="?curid=1151539" title="Triphenylmethane">
<text>Triphenylmethane or triphenyl methane (sometimes also known as Tritan), is the hydrocarbon with the formula (C6H5)3CH. This colorless solid is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents and not in water. Triphenylmethane is the basic skeleton of many synthetic dyes called triarylmethane dyes, many of them are pH indicators, and some display fluorescence. A trityl group in organic chemistry is a triphenylmethyl group Ph3C, e.g. triphenylmethyl chloride (trityl chloride) and the triphenylmethyl radical (trityl radical).

==Preparation==

Triphenylmethane was first synthesized in 1872 by the German chemist August Kekulé and his Dutch student Antoine Paul Nicolas Franchimont (1844–1919) by heating diphenylmercury (Hg(C6H5)2, &quot;Quecksilberdiphenyl&quot;) with benzal chloride (C6H5CHCl2, &quot;Benzylenchlorid&quot;).

Triphenylmethane can be synthesized by Friedel–Crafts reaction from benzene and chloroform with aluminium chloride catalyst:
:3 C6H6 + CHCl3 → Ph3CH + 3 HCl
Alternatively, benzene may react with carbon tetrachloride using the same catalyst to obtain the triphenylmethyl chloride–aluminium chloride adduct which is then treated with diethyl ether for 24 hours at room temperature and hydrolyzed with concentrated hydrochloric acid:
:3 C6H6 + CCl4 + AlCl3 → Ph3CCl·AlCl3
:Ph3CCl·AlCl3 + Et2O + HCl → Ph3CH

It can also be synthesized from benzylidene chloride, which is prepared from benzaldehyde and phosphorus pentachloride.

==Reactions of C-H bond==
The Ph3C-H bond is relatively weak, with a bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 81 kcal/mol, or about 24 kcal/mol less than methane. Correspondingly, triphenylmethane is mildly acidic, with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 33.297. 

Triphenylmethane is significantly more acidic than most other hydrocarbons because the charge is delocalized over three phenyl rings. Steric effects however prevent all three phenyl rings from achieving coplanarity simultaneously. Consequently diphenylmethane is even more acidic, albeit only slightly, because in its anion the charge is spread over two phenyl rings at the same time. 

The trityl anion is isolable in crown ethers:
Its sodium salt can be prepared from the chloride:
:(C6H5)3CCl + 2 Na → (C6H5)3CNa + NaCl

The use of tritylsodium as a strong, non-nucleophilic base has been eclipsed by the popularization of butyllithium and related strong bases. 

The unmodified anion is red, and can be used as an indicator in acid–base titrations. Derived substances have proven useful as chemical dyes.

==Triarylmethane dyes==

Examples of triarylmethane dyes are bromocresol green:

And the nitrogen-bearing malachite green:

==Trityl group==
===Protecting group===
The triphenylmethyl substituent, also called trityl after 1927 suggestion by Helferich et al., is widely used in organic chemistry. Trityl serves as a protecting group for alcohols.
: protection (requires proton acceptor): Ph3CCl + ROH → Ph3COR + HCl
: deprotection: Ph3COR + HBr → ROH + Ph3CBr

===Platform for unusual functional groups===
Trityl derivatives of reactive functional groups are often crystalline and in some cases sterically stabilized relative to less bulky derivatives. Three such derivatives are &quot;S&quot;-nitrosotriphenylmethanethiol (Ph3CSNO), tritylsulfenyl chloride (Ph3CSCl), and trityl sulfenamide (Ph3CSNH2).

<doc id="1151542" wikidata="Q695431" url="?curid=1151542" title="Atlas bear">
<text>The Atlas bear or North African bear (Ursus arctos crowtheri) was a population (or populations) of brown bears native to North Africa that became extinct in historical times.

== Range ==
The Atlas bear was Africa&#x27;s only native bear sub-species that survived into modern times. Once inhabiting the Atlas Mountains and neighbouring areas, from Morocco to Libya, the animal is now thought to be extinct.

== Description ==
The Atlas bear was brownish-black in colour and lacked a white mark on the muzzle. The fur was long and was reddish-orange on the underparts. The muzzle and claws were shorter than those of the American black bear, though it was stouter and thicker in body. The Atlas bear was said to have been long and weighed up to .

== Genetics ==
A mitochondrial DNA study of bones of Atlas bears ranging in age from 10,000 to 800 years Before Present found that the specimens belonged to two distinct clades: one, referred to as &quot;Clade V&quot;, was indistinguishable from brown bears found in the Iberian Peninsula, while the other &quot;Clade VI&quot;, was highly distinct from all other brown bears, either closely related to the polar bear and Alaskan brown bears or outside the group that contains all other brown bear mitochondrial lineages.

Atlas bears do not appear to be closely related to Middle Eastern brown bear populations, despite geographic proximity, which suggests that the colonization of North Africa by brown bears was an event of considerable antiquity.

== Ecology ==
The Atlas bear&#x27;s ecology is presumed to be similar to that of the other brown bears. Apparently fed on roots, acorns and nuts, the Atlas bear was said to have been mostly herbivorous, but since most bears today are omnivores, the Atlas bear is believed to have been able to eat meat as well. It was believed that, if it did eat meat, it probably ate small mammals as well as carrion while scavenging. Sympatric predators included the Barbary leopard and Barbary lion.

== Extinction ==
The Atlas bear became extinct shortly after modern firearms were developed. Over-hunting may have contributed to their decline. Pressure from zoo collectors sealed their fate, with the animals being taken away from one another and unable to reproduce and flourish. The Atlas bear finally became extinct in the late 19th century; the last one recorded to be killed by hunters was in 1870 in the Tetouan Mountains in northern Morocco. Human activity can definitely be said to have played a large role in causing the extinction of the Atlas bear.

<text>BRL-CAD is a constructive solid geometry (CSG) solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD) system. It includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing support for graphics rendering and geometric analysis, computer network distributed framebuffer support, scripting, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The entire package is distributed in source code and binary form.

Although BRL-CAD can be used for a variety of engineering and graphics applications, the package&#x27;s primary purpose continues to be the support of ballistic and electromagnetic analyses. In keeping with the Unix philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single, specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package, BRL-CAD is basically a collection of libraries, tools, and utilities that work together to create, raytrace, and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data. In contrast to many other 3D modelling applications, BRL-CAD primarily uses CSG rather than boundary representation. This means BRL-CAD can &quot;study physical phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal, radiative, neutron, and other types of transport&quot;. It does also support boundary representation.

The BRL-CAD libraries are designed primarily for the geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and design custom tools. Each library is designed for a specific purpose: creating, editing, and ray tracing geometry, and image handling. The application side of BRL-CAD also offers a number of tools and utilities that are primarily concerned with geometric conversion, interrogation, image format conversion, and command-line-oriented image manipulation.

==History==

In 1979, the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) expressed a need for tools that could assist with the computer simulation and engineering analysis of combat vehicle systems and environments. When no CAD package was found to be adequate for this purpose, BRL software developers – led by Mike Muuss – began assembling a suite of utilities capable of interactively displaying, editing, and interrogating geometric models. This suite became known as BRL-CAD. Development on BRL-CAD as a package subsequently began in 1983; the first public release was made in 1984. BRL-CAD became an open-source project in December 2004.

The BRL-CAD source code repository is the oldest known public version-controlled codebase in the world that&#x27;s still under active development, dating back to 1983-12-16 00:10:31 UTC.

<doc id="1151545" wikidata="Q3324460" url="?curid=1151545" title="Mort Garson">
<text>Morton Sanford Garson (20 July 1924 – 4 January 2008) was a Canadian composer, arranger, songwriter, and pioneer of electronic music. He is best known for his albums in the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;Mother Earth&#x27;s Plantasia&quot; (1976). He also co-wrote several hit songs, including &quot;Our Day Will Come&quot;, a hit for Ruby &amp; the Romantics. According to Allmusic, Mort Garson boasts one of the most distinctive and outright bizarre resumés in popular music, spanning from easy listening to occult-influenced space-age electronic pop.

==Early life==
Mort Garson was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, the son of Russian Jewish refugees. He later moved to New York City where he studied music at the Juilliard School of Music. He worked as a pianist and arranger before being called into the Army near the end of World War II.

==Early career==
After leaving the forces he became an active session musician, with an ability to carry out any or all of the musical chores on any given session: composer, arranger, orchestrator, conductor, and pianist as required. In 1957, he co-wrote Brenda Lee&#x27;s minor hit &quot;Dynamite&quot; with Tom Glazer, and he also co-wrote Cliff Richard&#x27;s 1961 UK hit &quot;Theme for a Dream&quot;. In 1963, with lyricist Bob Hilliard, he wrote one of the great lounge hits of the 1960s, &quot;Our Day Will Come&quot;, a hit for Ruby &amp; The Romantics.

Garson spent the mid-1960s on a rapid succession of accompaniment and arrangement jobs: two Doris Day albums (&quot;Doris Day&#x27;s Sentimental Journey&quot; and &quot;Latin for Lovers&quot;), Mel Tormé&#x27;s &quot;Right Now!&quot; album of contemporary covers like &quot;Secret Agent Man,&quot; and Glenn Yarborough&#x27;s highly successful cover of Rod McKuen songs, &quot;The Lonely Things&quot;. He also arranged for the Lettermen on Capitol Records, provided background to Laurence Harvey reading poetry on Atlantic Records, and provided arrangements for Esther Phillips, Julie London, Nancy Wilson, Chris Montez, Leslie Uggams, Joanie Sommers, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and many others. He was a favorite of producers when the job involved soft pop vocal groups and string ensembles, and was responsible for a wide variety of easy listening records, including &quot;Bossa Nova for All Ages&quot; by the Continentals, &quot;Symphony for the Soul&quot; by the Total Eclipse, and &quot;Sea Drift&quot; by the Dusk &#x27;Til Dawn Orchestra. In 1967, he arranged and produced Bill Withers&#x27; early single &quot;Three Nights and a Morning&quot;.

With Perry Botkin Jr., he arranged and conducted easy listening arrangements of big pop hits, among them the Hollyridge Strings&#x27; &quot;Play the Beatles Songbook&quot; album series and their &quot;Play the Hits of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&quot;. He also worked on albums and singles by The Sugar Shoppe, the Sunset Strings, and the Love Strings, and released singles under his own name. He arranged The Sandpipers&#x27; 1966 hit &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, and co-wrote its B-side &quot;What Makes You Dream, Pretty Girl?&quot; with lyricist Jacques Wilson, with whom he worked on later projects.

==Later career==
In 1967, Garson met Robert Moog at a music engineers&#x27; convention, and became one of the first arrangers and composers to work with the early Moog synthesizer; his electronic albums from the period are now highly prized among collectors and exotica fans. When he met Moog, Garson had already been working on a suite (with lyricist Jacques Wilson) called &quot;The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds—Celestial Counterpoint with Words and Music&quot;, which includes tracks for each of the 12 signs of the zodiac; he decided to incorporate Moog&#x27;s invention into the album. The recording features Paul Beaver on a variety of electronic instruments with voice-overs by Cyrus Faryar. Released in late 1967 on Elektra Records, it was the first album recorded on the West Coast to make use of the Moog synthesizer.

Also in 1967, he arranged the obscure single &quot;See The Cheetah&quot;, credited to the Big Game Hunters. In 1968, he was responsible for the string arrangements on Glen Campbell&#x27;s international hit &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix,&quot; and arranged two tracks on his album of the same title.

Another of Garson&#x27;s albums using the Moog, &quot;Electronic Hair Pieces&quot;, covered songs from the hippie-influenced musical &quot;Hair&quot;. The mod album cover art for &quot;Electronic Hair Pieces&quot; featured a model with a wired-up skull; liner notes were provided by Tom Smothers of the Smothers Brothers. Another album, &quot;The Wozard of Iz&quot;, a psychedelic satire based on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, also with words by Jacques Wilson, featured Bernie Krause providing environmental sound effects and Suzie Jane Hokom voicing Dorothy. Garson was quoted at the time: &quot;An electronic composer utilizes synthesizer as a means of expression… Of course he must remain master of the instrument and not vice versa, but given the unique vehicle, he has the medium in which, almost literally, the sky&#x27;s the limit for his imagination.&quot;

Following the success of the original &quot;Zodiac&quot; LP, Garson went on to compose and arrange a 12-album series of zodiac albums for A&amp;M Records, one album for each sign. Like &quot;Zodiac&quot;, each album contained original tunes with heavy use of electronics. In 1971, he composed an entirely instrumental electronic &quot;Black Mass&quot; album, released on Uni Records under the pseudonym Lucifer, that again featured the Moog. Jason Alkeny at Allmusic describes the &quot;Black Mass&quot; album as &quot;undoubtedly...his masterpiece&quot;. Garson also released, in 1972, a record of music-and-moans, &quot;Music for Sensuous Lovers&quot;, to capitalize on the best-seller at the time, &quot;The Sensuous Woman&quot; by &quot;Z&quot;. In 1974, he composed the electronic music score for the 18th Annual Grammy Award-winning Best Children&#x27;s Recording of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; narrated by Richard Burton. The following year, he released an album titled &quot;Ataraxia: The Unexplained&quot; designed to accompany meditations to the mantra of the listener&#x27;s choice. &quot;Mother Earth&#x27;s Plantasia&quot;, which was released in 1976, was a series of Moog compositions designed to be played for growing plants. According to his daughter, Day Darmet, Garson made the album inspired by her mother&#x27;s plants. Despite its extremely limited distribution, the album became a cult hit in the late 2010s when it was circulated online. &quot;Plantasia&quot;&#x27;s popularity was boosted by its sampling in Pharcyde&#x27;s track &quot;Guestlist&quot;, from the 2000 album &quot;Plain Rap&quot;.

In 2018, independent reissue label Rubellan Remasters licensed and released on CD for the first time Garson&#x27;s two occult-themed albums, remastered from original studio tapes. In 2019 and 2020, a further set of Garson albums, including &quot;Plantasia&quot;, which is now seen as his best-known album, and a set of previously unreleased recordings, &quot;Music from Patch Cord Productions&quot;, were issued both on CD and vinyl by Sacred Bones.

==Films, television and theatre work==
Garson also worked in television and film, scoring a wide variety of music for many different movies and TV shows, from &quot;Beware! The Blob!&quot; to &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; to &quot;National Geographic&quot; specials, although it is Elmer Bernstein who is credited with composing the well-known &quot;National Geographic&quot; orchestral theme that first appeared in on the magazine&#x27;s TV specials in 1966.

Garson&#x27;s music was used as incidental music during the television transmissions of the Apollo 11 crewed Moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969. He said: &quot;The only sounds that go along with space travel are electronic ones.… The Apollo film shows different facets of the flight—blast-off, separation of the stages of the rocket, scenes of the moon at close range, of the astronauts playing games in the ship, and of earth rise. [The music] has to carry the film along. It has to echo the sound of the blastoff and even the static you hear on the astronauts&#x27; report from space. People are used to hearing things from outer space, not just seeing them. So I used a big, symphonic sound for the blast-off, some jazzy things for the zero-G game of catch, psychedelic music for a section that uses negatives and diffuse colors on shots taken inside the ship, and a pretty melody for the moon. After all, it&#x27;s still a lovely moon.&quot;

In 1972 he wrote the music for the Larry Hagman-directed movie &quot;Son of Blob&quot; (also known as &quot;Beware! The Blob&quot;). He also scored the 1974 Fred Williamson film &quot;Black Eye&quot;, and adapted the music for Mel Brooks&#x27; and Carl Reiner&#x27;s 1975 animated television special &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot;.

In 1983 he composed the score for the West End musical &quot;Marilyn!&quot; which opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 17 March 1983. Jacques Wilson wrote the lyrics for the show which starred Stephanie Lawrence as Marilyn Monroe. He then scored the action films &quot;Treasure of the Amazon&quot; (1985) and &quot;Vultures&quot; (1987), which both starred Stuart Whitman.

In 2002, Garson composed the score for &quot;When Garbo Talks!&quot; a musical with book and lyrics by Buddy Kaye that had its world premiere 15 October 2010 at the Long Beach Performing Arts Center, International City Theatre.

Garson was closely associated with Heatter-Quigley Productions, creating the theme songs and music cues for the following TV game shows:
*&quot;Amateur&#x27;s Guide to Love&quot;
*&quot;Gambit&quot;
*&quot;Runaround&quot;
*&quot;Baffle&quot;
*&quot;The Magnificent Marble Machine&quot;
*&quot;Battlestars&quot;
The music for the first five featured Garson playing synthesizers, but the &quot;Battlestars&quot; package used more conventional marching band orchestration.

==Death==
Garson died of renal failure in San Francisco in 2008, at the age of 83.

==In popular culture==
A sample from Garson&#x27;s &quot;Planetary Motivations (Cancer)&quot; was incorporated into DJ Shadow&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;Building Steam with a Grain of Salt,&quot; from the album &quot;Endtroducing...&quot;. In the 1994 Peter Lynch short film &quot;Arrowhead&quot;, Ray Bud (played by Don McKellar) manipulates a dead fish while singing Mort Garson&#x27;s closing theme of the 1970s Canadian nature program &quot;Untamed World&quot;. The song &quot;Plantasia&quot; from the album &quot;Mother Earth&#x27;s Plantasia&quot; is used in the documentary &quot;Lil Bub &amp; Friendz&quot; and in the German TV show &quot;Böhmi brutzelt&quot; with Jan Böhmermann.

&quot;Deja Vu&quot; was used as the main theme for most of &quot;Balance&quot;, the first arc of the Maximum Fun podcast &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot;, with &quot;The Unexplained,&quot; &quot;Astral Projection,&quot; &quot;Cabala,&quot; &quot;Wind Dance,&quot; &quot;Tarot,&quot; and &quot;Music to Soothe the Savage Snake Plant&quot; also being used later on the series as an alternate theme and as background music, respectively, along with a cover version of &quot;Plantasia,&quot; arranged by Griffin McElroy. The song was also sampled on Kid Cudi’s 2016 song &quot;Baptized in Fire&quot;, from his album &quot;Passion, Pain &amp; Demon Slayin&#x27;&quot;, which also features Travis Scott. Canadian-American indie pop artist Curtis Waters has cited &quot;Mother Earth&#x27;s Plantasia&quot; as an influence on his own work.

<doc id="1151548" wikidata="Q7324959" url="?curid=1151548" title="Dick Crawshaw, Baron Crawshaw of Aintree">
<text>Richard Crawshaw, Baron Crawshaw of Aintree, OBE (25 September 1917 – 16 July 1986) was elected as a British Labour Party Member of Parliament in 1964 but joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981.

==Early life==
Crawshaw was born in Salford, the son of Percy Crawshaw and Beatrice (née Barrett). He attended Pendleton Grammar School, before leaving to train as an engineer at the age of 16. Prior to World War II he had been a theological student, but soon after its outbreak he enlisted in the Royal Artillery and Parachute Regiment. Upon demobilisation he matriculated as an undergraduate at Pembroke College, Cambridge, taking a special two-year &#x27;war degree&#x27;. He then studied at the University of London for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree, and took his pupillage at the Inner Temple. In 1948 he was called to the bar, serving on the Northern Circuit.

==Politics==
Crawshaw became active in Liverpool politics after the war, representing the Dingle ward on Liverpool Borough Council from 1948. His council ward was very safe for the Labour Party, although the constituency that it was situated in – Liverpool Toxteth – was a marginal seat for the Conservatives from its creation in 1950. He campaigned for issues such as better standard of council housing and state schools.

Crawshaw was elected as MP for Liverpool Toxteth in 1964, beating the sitting Conservative Reginald Bevins by 2,784 votes. In parliament he was a strong supporter of the Territorial Army, and on one occasion voted against the annual Defence Estimates because they failed to make a large enough provision for it. He was reported to have been a very diligent MP, who called on constituents&#x27; homes in several streets each week, often to the surprise of the residents.

In March 1981 Crawshaw was one of the initial group of 13 Labour MPs who founded the SDP. Unlike the other defectors, his participation was considered &quot;something of a surprise to journalists.&quot; After Liverpool Toxteth was abolished he stood in 1983 for the new constituency of Liverpool Broadgreen, which did not contain any part of his former seat. Notionally a safe Labour constituency, Crawshaw&#x27;s candidacy was further complicated by the existence of an Independent Liberal on the ballot. He received 5,169 votes (11.24%), but was beaten into last place. Crawshaw was created a life peer as Baron Crawshaw of Aintree, &quot;of Salford in the County of Greater Manchester&quot; on 17 May 1985.

==Personal life==
Crawshaw married Audrey Lima in 1960; they had no children. He listed his hobbies in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as &quot;Climbing, walking, free fall parachuting and youth activities&quot;, and in 1974 set a world record by walking 231 miles non-stop, raising thousands of pounds on behalf of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

Crawshaw lived for most of his life in Aintree, a very safe Conservative area in the Ormskirk constituency. During his time in Parliament he lived in Chelsea with fellow Liverpool Labour MP James Dunn, who also joined the SDP.

<doc id="1151551" wikidata="Q555983" url="?curid=1151551" title="Dave Holland (drummer)">
<text>David Holland (5 April 1948 – 16 January 2018) was an English drummer, best remembered for his time with the rock band Trapeze from 1969 to 1979 and Judas Priest from 1979 to 1989.

== Early life ==

At the age of six Holland began piano lessons, but soon developed a &quot;mania for the drums&quot; in his own words and begged his parents to let him have a set. After his first appearance as a stand-in for a local band, Holland realized he wanted to be a musician. When he was 14 years old, he supplemented his pocket money by playing with another local band called The Drumbeats, and selling furniture and carpets.

As a youngster, Holland listened to traditional jazz. He cited his first rock influence as Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. Later, he became interested in funk music in the vein of Booker T &amp; the MG&#x27;s, the blues rock of Free and progressive–psychedelic music of Traffic.

== Career ==

=== Early bands ===
In early 1965 he was with Northampton band Dorian Gray. Later that year Holland was persuaded to leave and join The Liberators who had recording and management contracts ready within a few weeks to evolve into Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours, a pop band that put autoharp to good use, taking after The Loving Spoonful. In 1966 a single, &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; (released 15 January 1966 on Decca, produced by future The Moody Blues producer Tony Clarke), peaked at No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart.

=== Finders Keepers ===
Holland stayed with the band until August 1968, when he joined Finders Keepers, a pop cover outfit. However, Holland continued studio session work. He did not play on a 1969 No. 5 hit single &quot;Smile a Little Smile for Me&quot; released by the band that used to be Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours under the name of The Flying Machine.

Finders Keepers, who were soon joined by Mel Galley (guitar) and Glenn Hughes (bass), recorded several singles, with some of the songs now available on various compilations. Soon afterwards the threesome joined forces with vocalist and winds player John Jones and multi-instrumentalist Terry Rowley of The Montanas fame to form a quintet called Trapeze (the band name was Terry Rowley&#x27;s idea).

=== Trapeze ===
Trapeze appeared in the British TV show &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot; and soon was swamped with offers of recording contracts, including one from The Beatles&#x27; Apple. Trapeze, however, settled for the newly formed Threshold label, belonging to The Moody Blues members. The band would soon open for The Moodies and other well-known acts. On Threshold, the band released three records, the debut as a quintet and the rest as a power trio.

Trapeze were gaining momentum at the time, especially in the southern United States, but lost a major contributor as Glenn Hughes decided to leave the band and join Deep Purple for the recording of their &quot;Burn&quot; album.

Mel Galley and Dave Holland added a bass player and a second guitarist. Dave Holland and Mel Galley also toured as part of John Lodge (musician) – Justin Hayward (of The Moody Blues fame) band &quot;The Blue Jays&quot; (Blue Jays (album)).

In 1978 Trapeze recorded their last studio LP, &quot;Running&quot;/&quot;Hold On&quot;.

Earlier on, both Galley and Holland lent a hand in the recording of Glenn Hughes&#x27; first solo album, &quot;Play Me Out&quot;, offering a unique blend of psychedelic jazz funk. Holland was assisted by Mark Nauseef on percussion.

In 1979 and 1980, Holland recorded some drum parts for Justin Hayward&#x27;s solo albums, &quot;Songwriter&quot; and &quot;Night Flight&quot;.

=== Judas Priest ===
Holland left Trapeze and joined Judas Priest in August 1979. He played drums on many of Judas Priest&#x27;s platinum albums, such as &quot;British Steel&quot;, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;, &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;Ram It Down.&quot;

During the 1980s, Holland also collaborated with guitarist Robin George, as part of his band Life and on George&#x27;s solo project, &quot;Dangerous Music&quot;.

In 1989, personal problems (health and family issues) and musical differences forced Holland to leave Judas Priest. He was replaced by original Saints Or Sinners drummer Scott Travis, who had also previously played in the band Racer X.

=== Later career ===
Throughout the 1990s, besides touring with briefly reformed Trapeze and filling in for various bands like The Screaming Jets during their European tours, Holland gave drum clinics and private lessons, managed and produced bands such as UK band The Love Garden and the Swedish &quot;teen funk trio&quot; Shutlanger Sam (fronted by Kim Fransson who later had a solo career where he collaborated with among others hit songwriters Andreas Carlsson and Desmond Child) whom Holland introduced in person at a show with his former Trapeze bandmate Glenn Hughes in Vänersborg 1996, and played on various recordings of his former mates. In 1996, he participated in sessions that involved Glenn Hughes, Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath fame, and keyboardist Don Airey. In 1998, a collaboration with Al Atkins, Judas Priest&#x27;s original singer, was released, featuring a few covers of early Priest songs that Holland did not originally play on. Judas Priest with Atkins at the helm had supported Trapeze in 1971.

== Imprisonment ==
In 2004, Holland was arrested and later found guilty by a jury at Northampton Crown Court of one count of attempted rape and five counts of indecent assault against a 17-year-old male with learning difficulties. The offences occurred at Holland&#x27;s rural English home in 2002 against a boy who had hired Holland to give him drum lessons. The jury also found a co-accused, 22-year-old Spiros Laouitaris, not guilty of four counts of indecent assault. Following the verdict, Judge Charles Wide told the court that Holland had &quot;deliberately and calculatedly planned a strategy to abuse a boy who he knew was exceptionally vulnerable&quot;. Holland had steadfastly denied all charges, telling the court &quot;There might have been the odd hug or something like that. I know it is politically incorrect nowadays, but kids like to be shown a bit of affection.&quot; It was revealed at trial that the victim had occasionally spent the night at Holland&#x27;s house while taking lessons, and his parents learned of what Holland was doing when they received a letter from their son detailing the sexual abuse. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. In an interview during the criminal proceedings, Holland revealed publicly for the first time that he was bisexual.

Holland had recently completed some recording sessions with guitarist Tony Iommi. When word of his arrest became public, Iommi had Holland&#x27;s drum tracks removed and re-recorded by Jimmy Copley, not wanting any association with a convicted sex offender.

Holland was scheduled for release from prison in 2012 and had reportedly served his full sentence that year.

In late 2006, Holland told author Neil Daniels in a letter from prison that he was in the process of writing his autobiography. Holland also stated his intent to appeal his conviction, saying &quot;I was convicted of a crime that I didn&#x27;t commit, and like so many others in similar situations to the one in which I find myself, an offense that never even existed in the first place...&quot;. He also railed against the legal system itself, telling Daniels &quot;There is absolutely no difference whatsoever between the criteria that is permitted to be applied in sex offences now and that which was applied in cases of witchcraft in the 17th century.&quot;

== Death ==
Holland died on 16 January, 2018 at in Lugo, Spain. Holland had been living in the nearby town of A Fonsagrada. The newspaper reported that Holland&#x27;s remains had been cremated. A doctor had said that the death was due to lung cancer.

<text>Robert M. &quot;Bob&quot; Shrum (born July 21, 1943) is the director of the Center for the Political Future and the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at the University of Southern California, where he is a professor of political science in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. He is a former American political consultant, who has worked on numerous Democratic campaigns, including as senior advisor to the Kerry-Edwards campaign in 2004 and to the Gore-Lieberman campaign in 2000. Shrum wrote the famous speech Ted Kennedy gave at the 1980 Democratic National Convention conceding to and supporting President Jimmy Carter. He has been described as &quot;the most sought-after consultant in the Democratic Party.&quot; Shrum served as speechwriter to New York Mayor John V. Lindsay from 1970 to 1971, speechwriter to Senator George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign and speechwriter and press secretary to Senator Edward M. Kennedy from 1980 to 1984 and political consultant until 2009.

Shrum&#x27;s book, &quot;No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner&quot;, was published in June 2007 by Simon and Schuster.

==Early life==
Shrum was born in Connellsville, Pennsylvania on July 21, 1943, the son of Cecilia (Welsh) and Clarence Shrum. His father was a tool-and-die maker and his maternal grandfather was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. His mother was from an Irish immigrant family. Shrum was raised in Los Angeles. He is a graduate of Loyola High School of Los Angeles and Georgetown University (where he was named the outstanding debater at the 1965 national policy debate championship, the National Debate Tournament). On December 21, 1965, he made his first television appearance as a law student, debating Henry Kissinger on a broadcast of the CBS program &quot;Town Meeting of the World.&quot; He later received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.

==Political career==

===Speechwriter===
Shrum began his political career as a speechwriter in 1970, first for Republican New York City Mayor John Lindsay, and then for United States Senators Edmund Muskie and Ted Kennedy. Shrum was also a speechwriter for 1972 Democratic Party presidential nominee George McGovern as well as for 1976 Democratic Party presidential nominee Jimmy Carter. Shrum worked for Governor Carter for a total of ten days, and quit the night Carter won the Pennsylvania Primary. In his resignation letter to Carter, Shrum wrote &quot;I am not sure what you believe in, other than yourself.&quot;

Shrum later worked for Ted Kennedy and wrote the famous speech Kennedy gave at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. After Kennedy&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1980, Shrum returned to work in his Senate office as his press secretary until 1984, after which he became director of Kennedy&#x27;s Fund for a Democratic Majority Political Action Committee until 1985.

===Political consultant===

====Non-presidential campaigns====
In 1976, Shrum began work as a political consultant, designing campaign advertising and message strategy for Democratic candidates at the presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial levels, partnering with Pat Caddell and David Doak. Their first client was Jerry Baliles, who was running to succeed Chuck Robb as governor of Virginia.

The partnership with Pat Caddell dissolved in 1986, and Doak and Shrum continued to work together through a new firm for nine years. During their partnership, they served as strategic consultants and ad-makers for the successful campaigns of Bob Casey for Governor of Pennsylvania, Alan Cranston for reelection to the Senate in California, and Barbara Mikulski for Senate in Maryland. Mikulski would go on to become the first woman who was elected to the Senate who did not have a husband or father who served in high political office.

The firm continued to grow, acquiring new partners such as Peter Harris, Michelle Carrier, and Mike Donilon, while political consultants Joe Trippi and Steve McMahon began their media consulting careers at the firm.

Doak, Shrum, and Associates worked on the following campaigns, among others:
* The reelection of United States Senator Alan Cranston in 1986 
* Ted Kennedy&#x27;s United States Senate campaign in 1988 
* David Dinkins for mayor of New York in 1989 
* The reelection of United States Senator Paul Simon 
* David Walters for Governor of Oklahoma
* Zell Miller for Governor of Georgia
* Richard Gephardt for election to Congress and Presidential bid
* The reelection of Denver mayor Federico Peña
* Art Agnos for mayor of San Francisco
* Tom Bradley for mayor of Los Angeles
* Alex Penelas for mayor of Miami-Dade County
* The reelection of Chicago mayor Harold Washington
* The reelection of Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode
* John D. Waihee III for Governor of Hawaii
* Bob Kerrey for President in 1992
* John Glenn for United States Senate
In 1995, following the dissolution of Doak, Shrum, and Associates, Shrum partnered with Tad Devine and Mike Donilon. Devine, Donilon, and Shrum&#x27;s firm went on to work for the following campaigns:
* Reelection of New York mayor David Dinkins (lost)
* Reelection of Ted Kennedy against Mitt Romney for United States Senate
* Reelection of Senator Chuck Robb from Virginia to the United States Senate
* Election of Herb Kohl to United States Senator from Wisconsin, and his reelection campaign in 1994
* Reelection of Tom Foley, Congressman from Washington (lost)
* Jane Harman for Congress in 1992, 1994, and 1996
* Reelection of United States Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts
* Reelection of Joseph P. Kennedy II, congressman from Massachusetts
* Reelection of United States Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa
* Election of Jack Reed for United States Senator from Rhode Island
* Election of Robert Torricelli for United States Senator from New Jersey
* Reelection of Congresswoman Louise Slaughter from New York&#x27;s 25th district
* Parris Glendening for governor of Maryland
* Joe Lieberman for United States Senate
* Paul Sarbanes for reelection to the United States Senate
* Jon Corzine for United States Senate
* Bill Nelson for United States Senate
* Mark Dayton for United States Senate
* Ray Mabus for governor of Mississippi 
* Bob Casey Jr. for Auditor General of Pennsylvania
* Frank Lautenberg for United States Senate
* Chris Dodd for United States Senate
* Harris Wofford for United States Senate
* Joe Biden for United States Senate
* Bernie Sanders for Congress
* Bill White for mayor of Houston

====Presidential campaigns====
In 1986, Shrum began work as a political consultant, designing campaign advertising and message strategy for Democratic candidates at the presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial levels. He worked for the Dick Gephardt campaign during the 1988 Democratic primaries, including Gephardt&#x27;s surprise victory in the Iowa caucus, but after Gephardt&#x27;s defeat, Shrum helped Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis in preparing for his debates against Vice President George Bush. Dukakis lost the general election.

In 1992, Shrum worked for Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who was defeated for the nomination by Bill Clinton.

In 2000, Shrum helped Al Gore beat back a primary challenge from former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and win the Democratic nomination. Gore won the popular vote in the November presidential election versus George W. Bush, but lost the electoral vote.

In 2004, Shrum worked on John Kerry&#x27;s campaign, guiding him to a victory in the crucial Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and soon after, the Democratic presidential nomination, only for Kerry to be defeated in the general election by George W. Bush.

Critics often point out Shrum&#x27;s long losing streak, since he has yet to claim victory for any of his candidates in eight presidential elections.

Foreign campaigns

Shrum has also consulted on a number of foreign campaigns, including as a strategic advisor for the British Labour Party elections from 1989 to 2005, Ehud Barak&#x27;s campaign for Israeli prime minister against Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999 and 2001, the Irish Republican Party Fianna Fáil in the 1997 and 2002 national elections, and the successful Bolivian presidential campaigns of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada in 1993 and 2002.

==Journalism==
Shrum was a columnist for &quot;The Week&quot; magazine&#x27;s website along with his conservative counterpart, David Frum. As a journalist, Shrum’s work appeared in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and The New Republic, among other publications.

He was a columnist for the on-line magazine &quot;Slate&quot;.

==Academic career==
Shrum has been a Senior Fellow at New York University&#x27;s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, where he taught a class on domestic policy formation and analysis. He also taught an undergraduate seminar to freshmen on Presidential debates and speeches since the 1960s.

He now holds the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at the University of Southern California. At USC, Shrum hosts regular talks, called &quot;Political Conversations,&quot; with individuals from every side of the political sphere. The events are open to all students at the university. Shrum, a Democrat, serves as Director of the USC Center for the Political Future, and he shares the leadership post with Co-Director Mike Murphy, his long-time Republican rival and friend.

==Memoir==
Shrum has written a political memoir entitled &quot;No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner&quot;, published in June 2007. It has received attention in the media for its less than flattering portrayal of Shrum&#x27;s former client, John Edwards.

==Personal life==
Shrum is married to Marylouise Oates, a writer and former columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. He has one stepson, the television writer Michael Oates Palmer.

==Media==
Shrum&#x27;s firm, Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS), was featured in the 2005 documentary &quot;Our Brand Is Crisis&quot; depicting its work campaigning for Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada during the 2002 Bolivian presidential election.

<text>Paul Henry Beaver Jr. (August 14, 1925 – January 16, 1975) was an American musician who was a pioneer in popular electronic music, using the Moog synthesizer. From 1967, Beaver collaborated with Bernie Krause as the recording duo Beaver &amp; Krause.

==Early life and career==
Born in Columbiana, Ohio, Paul Beaver studied classical music and learned the organ, before acquiring technical knowledge of electronics while serving in the US Navy in World War II. After the war, he played the organ at the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, made music and special effects for movies such as &quot;The Magnetic Monster&quot; (1953), and became a technical consultant to the Hammond Organ Company. He also became a successful session musician, had his own recording studio, and rented out musical instruments from his collection.

==Work with Bernie Krause==

Beaver was the electronic half of a 1967 experimental free-form album for Dunhill Records with studio drummer Hal Blaine called &quot;Psychedelic Percussion&quot;. In 1966, he was approached by Jac Holzman of Elektra Records, who wished to make an album that used electronic music in a format that would appeal to the emerging hippie culture. Holzman introduced Beaver to Bernie Krause, another synthesizer enthusiast. They decided to pool their savings to buy a Moog synthesizer, and agreed to work together on the project, alongside composer and arranger Mort Garson. The result was the album &quot;The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds&quot;.

They continued to work together in a project to master the new Moog synthesizer and present it as a viable instrument for film and recording work. From 1967, Beaver collaborated with Krause as the recording duo Beaver &amp; Krause. They were one of the first groups to record pop-commercial electronic music, which later became known as electronica. Their double album &quot;The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music&quot;, issued on Jac Holzman&#x27;s Nonesuch record label, was a landmark work, introducing the public to the full range of individual sounds that the Moog could make, and in great detail.

As Robert Moog&#x27;s sales representatives on the U.S. West Coast, they attracted limited industry interest until the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, when musicians and artists&#x27; representatives visited their stall and began placing orders for Moogs. Over the next two years, Beaver played a key role in popularizing the instrument in rock music and in film and television. During that time, he undertook a steady stream of session work for their Moog customers and led workshops attended by film composers and session keyboardists.

Among his many appearances on recordings by pop and rock acts, Beaver played the Moog on The Monkees&#x27; song &quot;Star Collector&quot;, the final song on their fourth album &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot;, released in November 1967, and on The Byrds&#x27; &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, from their 1968 album &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;. He also contributed to the Elektra Records 1966 release &quot;The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds&quot;, an album that is widely recognised as the first recording in the genre to feature the Moog synthesizer.

Beaver was a friend and associate of George Martin, and he aided in the production of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album, supplying the first-generation Hammond B3 organ which provided the strange sound effect at the end of &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; (accomplished by switching the motorized &#x27;tone wheel&#x27; off and on). During this time he and musician-engineer Phil Davis built a custom polyphonic Moog modular synthesizer, based on the Moog Apollo prototype, for Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer that was one of the first electronic instruments to have programmable preset sounds, controlled by an auxiliary 8-bit computer which used a TV monitor. In addition, Beaver, together with associates Phil Davis and Dan Wyman, worked alongside composer Alexander Courage, composing and performing incidental ambient music (&quot;The Cage&quot; and others) and creating several sound effects for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.

Beaver &amp; Krause continued releasing electronic albums, first for Mercury Records&#x27; spin-off label, Limelight, with their album &quot;Ragnarok&quot; (1969), then three albums for Warner Bros. Records: &quot;In a Wild Sanctuary&quot; (1970), &quot;Gandharva&quot; (1971), and &quot;All Good Men&quot; (1972). Combining the Moog with acoustic instruments, these albums are key early documents of the &quot;New Age&quot; musical movement. The ending of the track &quot;Spaced&quot;, from the &quot;Wild Sanctuary&quot; album, which features two synthesizers simultaneously gliding up and down to merge into a final single chord, was later re-performed to become the musical soundtrack for the original THX logo used in movie theatres. With Ruth White, Beaver established the Electronic Music Association in the 1970s.

==Personal life and death==
Beaver was a Scientologist, a right-wing Republican, unmarried, and a bisexual proponent of sexual liberation.
His health began to deteriorate in 1973. He died of a cerebral aneurysm in January 1975, at the age of 49, while working on a revised version of &quot;The Nonesuch Guide&quot;.

==Legacy==
Writing on his website Head Heritage (under his pseudonym &quot;the Seth Man&quot;), musician and musicologist Julian Cope describes Beaver as &quot;one of the first and most unique American synthesizer players&quot;. Tom Oberheim said of Beaver that &quot;other than Carlos, [he was] probably the person most responsible for getting the synthesizer thing going.&quot;

<text>John Wellborn Martin (June 21, 1884 – February 22, 1958) was an American politician who served as the 24th Governor of Florida, from 1925 to 1929. He also served as the 32nd Mayor of Jacksonville, from 1917 to 1923. Born in Plainfield in Marion County, Florida, Martin and his family moved to Jacksonville in 1899. Despite only about four years of formal education, he studied law and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1914. Three years later, Martin ran for Mayor of Jacksonville and easily defeated incumbent J. E. T. Bowden, becoming the city&#x27;s youngest mayor at age 32. He was easily re-elected twice in landslide victories and served three consecutive terms.

Martin declined to seek a fourth term in 1923 and instead ran for Governor of Florida in 1924. In the Democratic Party primary, he defeated four other candidates, including former Governor Sidney Johnston Catts. With the Democratic primary then being tantamount to election, Martin won the general election with nearly 83% of the vote against Republican William R. O&#x27;Neal. During his tenure, tourism, land speculation, and road development increased, despite the collapse of the land boom in the mid-1920s. The contemporaneous Constitution of Florida barred Martin from seeking a second consecutive term in 1928. He unsuccessfully ran for United States Senator in 1928 and Governor of Florida again in 1932. Martin died on February 22, 1958, about a month after having a severe heart attack.

Martin was born in Plainfield in Marion County, Florida, one of five children born to John M. Martin and Willie Owens Martin. His paternal grandfather was John Marshall Martin, a slaveowner who served in the Confederate Army and the Confederate Congress, and his maternal grandfather was James Byeram Owens, a slaveowner who served in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States.

During his childhood, Martin worked on his father&#x27;s plantation and received a country school education, but estimated that he had only about four years of formal education. Martin and his family moved to Jacksonville in 1899. He married Lottie Pepper in 1907. The couple had one child, John Wellborn Martin, Jr., but he died during infancy. Martin had studied law since his family moved to Jacksonville and passed the Florida Bar exam in 1914, before establishing a law career. Prior to seeking public office, Martin toured the state and gave a number of speeches in favor of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s policies.

==Mayor of Jacksonville and Governor of Florida==
In 1917, he was elected Mayor of Jacksonville at age 32, becoming the youngest mayor in the city&#x27;s history. Martin easily defeated incumbent J. E. T. Bowden by a vote of 2,890 to 2,056. He would easily be re-elected twice, winning 14 out of 15 of the city&#x27;s wards in his third and final campaign for the office. During his tenure as Mayor of Jacksonville, Martin supported a progressive program of public improvements and sought reform for the fire and police departments.

Toward the end of his third term as Mayor of Jacksonville, Martin announced he would not seek re-election and instead declared his candidacy for 1924 Florida gubernatorial election. In the Democratic Party on June 3, Martin defeated former Governor Sidney Johnston Catts, Frank E. Jennings, Worth W. Trammell (brother of Senator and former Governor Park Trammell), and Charles H. Spencer. There were 55,715 votes for Martin, 43,230 votes for Catts, 37,962 votes for Jennings, 8,381 votes for Trammell, and 1,408 votes for Spencer. Because no candidate received a majority, the second choice of Jennings, Trammell, and Spencer voters were added to the totals for Martin and Catts. Martin won with 73,054 votes versus 49,297 votes for Catts. With the Democratic primary then being tantamount to election, Martin won the general election. He defeated Republican William R. O&#x27;Neal by a vote of 84,181 to 17,499, a margin of 65.58%.

Martin was inaugurated on January 6, 1925, and served until January 8, 1929. On May 30, 1925, the Florida Legislature established Martin County – named after Governor Martin while he was in office – created from about of land from southern St. Lucie County and northern Palm Beach County; the city of Stuart was designated the county seat. Indian River County was established on the same day. Later in 1925, the state&#x27;s newest counties were established – Gulf and Gilchrist. During his tenure, tourism and land speculation purchases increased, road and highway developments were advanced, and an industrial plant for physically disabled prisoners was created. Martin also advocated for state-funded public schools and for granting free schoolbooks to all students through sixth grade.

Despite the growth, Martin also presided over the collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s. In a failed attempt to fight bad publicity about real estate scams, Martin and a delegation went to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, owned by T. Coleman du Pont (an investor in Addison Mizner&#x27;s projects), in New York City and held a seminar called &quot;The Truth About Florida&quot;. Two of the worst hurricanes in the history of the state – the 1926 Miami and 1928 Okeechobee hurricanes – also occurred during Martin&#x27;s tenure. The former devastated the areas in the vicinity of Miami and towns along the western shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as Clewiston and Moore Haven, leaving at least 372 fatalities and up to $125 million (1926 USD) in damage. The hurricane also resulted in further discussion between Martin and officials across the state about drainage projects around Lake Okeechobee. However, disputes about financing the projects left many residents along the lake vulnerable to flooding. After wreaking havoc in coastal Palm Beach County, the 1928 hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee to breach the then- mud dikes at its southeastern shores, inundating areas with as much as of water. The cities of Belle Glade, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay were devastated, with the loss of more than 2,500 lives. After personally assessing the damage with Florida Attorney General Fred Henry Davis, chief engineer Fred C. Elliott, and Florida Adjutant General Vivian B. Collins, Martin telegraphed all mayors of Florida cities to send aid to the victims. Discussion about drainage and dikes along Lake Okeechobee re-commenced, but the projects did not begin until after the passage of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, after Martin left office.

==Post-governorship==
The Florida Constitution at the time barred a governor from serving two consecutive terms. Martin was succeeded by Doyle E. Carlton in January 1929. Martin decided to run for United States Senator in 1928. However, he was defeated by incumbent Park Trammell in the Democratic primary, losing by a vote of 138,534 to 100,454. Martin made his final run for political office in 1932, seeking the governorship of Florida again. He received the most votes in a seven candidate field that included state&#x27;s attorney David Sholtz and former Governor Cary A. Hardee. However, he garnered only 24.19% of the vote, well short of a majority. Martin thus advanced to a run-off election against Sholtz, but was defeated by a wide margin of 62.8%—37.2%.

After retiring from politics, Martin built his own house in Tallahassee in 1933, which has been listed as a National Historic Place since 1986. After living at the property for about seven or eight years, Martin sold the house to local developers in 1941. He returned to Jacksonville, where he continued to practice law and became an investment broker. Martin was appointed a co-trustee of the Florida East Coast Railway, along with former Senator Scott Loftin. Upon Loftin&#x27;s death in 1953, Martin became the sole trustee. On February 22, 1958, Martin died of a heart attack at East Coast Hospital in St. Augustine. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Jacksonville.

<doc id="1151571" wikidata="Q2439853" url="?curid=1151571" title="Caught in the Act (Styx album)">
<text>Caught in the Act is a live double album by Styx, released in 1984. It contains one new song, &quot;Music Time,&quot; which was released as a single, reaching #40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts.

&quot;Caught in the Act&quot; is also the name of a VHS video recording that featured the band acting out the concept established in their &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; album. A DVD version was released on December 11, 2007.

Shortly after this album&#x27;s release, Tommy Shaw announced his departure from the band to pursue a solo career. The band then went into hiatus for the rest of the 1980s. &quot;Caught In The Act&quot; would ultimately prove to be the final album by the massively successful 1975-84 Styx lineup of Dennis DeYoung, Shaw, James Young, Chuck Panozzo, and John Panozzo; by the time Shaw returned to the band in 1995, John Panozzo&#x27;s declining health prevented his participation, and he died in 1996.

<doc id="1151580" wikidata="Q2280124" url="?curid=1151580" title="Shuichi Shigeno">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist famous for creating &quot;Initial D&quot;. Shigeno has also created &quot;Bari Bari Densetsu&quot;, &quot;Dopkan&quot;, and &quot;Tunnel Nuketara Sky Blue&quot; (&quot;First Love in Summer&quot;). In 1985, he received the Kodansha Manga Award in shōnen for &quot;Bari Bari Densetsu&quot;.

==Early life==
Shuichi Shigeno was born in , , Niigata Prefecture. When Shigeno was in high school, he was obsessed with motorcycles, which resulted in one of his best-selling series, &quot;Bari Bari Densetsu&quot;. Before Shigeno became a manga artist, he was a poor student. Still, after &quot;Baribari Densetsu&quot; sold well and got a lot of money from royalties on the first edition, he bought his first car (Toyota AE86) and lived in a small apartment.

==Career==
After &quot;Bari Bari Densetsu&quot; was sold, Shigeno wanted to make another book. And one of Shigeno&#x27;s friends told Shigeno he liked cars, &quot;so why not write it down?&quot; Shigeno thought about the idea, but part of him resisted, due to going out of business if writing about cars had not worked out. Since Shigeno was writing about cars, he used his first car, the Toyota AE86, to help him write &quot;Initial D&quot;. After &quot;Initial D&quot; was published, it became a huge hit.

In 2017, after &quot;Initial D&quot; was completed, he started a sequel series titled &quot;MF Ghost&quot;, which continues most of Initial D&#x27;s legacy in focusing on racing theories and cars. In November 2022, &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot; announced that &quot;MF Ghost&quot; would be on a hiatus due to Shigeno&#x27;s declining health to prevent him from overworking. The series resumed on June 19, 2023, and concluded on February 16, 2025.

<text>A pyrotechnic cocking charge is a device used to cock or re-cock an automatic cannon, such as the Mauser BK-27 or the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23. Such devices are not necessary in an externally powered cannon, such as the electrically driven M61 Vulcan, where the external power source is used to operate the mechanism of the weapon. The number of charges carried varies by design – the GSh-6-23 has a generous complement of ten, while others have as few as one. One of the benefits of an automatic cannon that isn&#x27;t powered electrically is that they accelerate to their maximum rate of fire much more quickly. There is less &quot;spin-up&quot; time for the barrels than with an externally powered rotary cannon.</text><links>

<doc id="1151595" wikidata="Q898449" url="?curid=1151595" title="Escapism">
<text>Escapism is mental diversion from unpleasant aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism also may be used to occupy one&#x27;s self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness.

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world. Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word &quot;escapism&quot; often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action. Indeed, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defined escapism as &quot;The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured&quot;.

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. C. S. Lewis was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers and considered that, used in moderation, escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers. Similarly, J. R. R. Tolkien argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be &#x27;mere escapism&#x27;). Terry Pratchett considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature. Apart from literature, music and video games have been seen and valued as artistic media of escape, too.

==Psychological escapes==
Freud considers a quota of escapist fantasy a necessary element in the life of humans: &quot;[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. &#x27;We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions&#x27;, Theodor Fontane once said, &quot;His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset&quot;; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted moods, especially anger and sadness.

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such psychic retreats, the results will often be negative and even pathological. Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of bettering the condition of the people – what Juvenal called &quot;bread and the games&quot;.

Social philosopher Ernst Bloch wrote that utopias and images of fulfillment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere &quot;daydreaming&quot; or &quot;escapism&quot; from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an &quot;immature, but honest substitute for revolution&quot;.

Escapist societies appear often in literature. &quot;The Time Machine&quot; depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror of their happy lifestyle beliefs. The novel subtly criticizes capitalism, or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society, television and &quot;seashell radios&quot; are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction film &quot;Summer Wars&quot; and the game &quot;Society&quot; in the 2009 American science fiction film &quot;Gamer&quot;, a play on the real-life MMO game &quot;Second Life&quot;. Other escapist societies in literature include &quot;The Reality Bug&quot; by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they &#x27;jump&#x27; into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti-hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect to regain control over their dying planet.

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state (Csikszentmihalyi) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation (Baumeister). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the &quot;escape scale&quot; to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people&#x27;s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
Alan Brinkley, author of &quot;Culture and Politics in the Great Depression&quot;, presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by the stock market crash in 1929: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. &quot;Life&quot; magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give &quot;no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment&quot;. Famous director Preston Sturges aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; about a director of lightweight comedies wanting to make a serious message picture titled &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic Mickey Mouse cartoon that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how &quot;foolish and vain and self-indulgent&quot; it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films &quot;consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems&quot;, but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.

<doc id="1151599" wikidata="Q414689" url="?curid=1151599" title="Silver(I) fluoride">
<text>Silver(I) fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula AgF. It is one of the three main fluorides of silver, the others being silver subfluoride and silver(II) fluoride. AgF has relatively few niche applications; it has been employed as a fluorination and desilylation reagent in organic synthesis and in aqueous solution as a topical caries treatment in dentistry.

The hydrates of AgF present as colorless, while pure anhydrous samples are yellow.

== Preparation ==
High-purity silver(I) fluoride can be produced by the heating of silver carbonate to under a hydrogen fluoride environment, in a platinum tube:

Laboratory routes to the compound typically avoid the use of gaseous hydrogen fluoride. One method is the thermal decomposition of silver tetrafluoroborate:

In an alternative route, silver(I) oxide is dissolved in concentrated aqueous hydrofluoric acid, and the silver fluoride is precipitated out of the resulting solution by acetone.

== Properties ==
=== Structure===
The structure of AgF has been determined by X-ray diffraction. At ambient temperature and pressure, silver(I) fluoride exists as the polymorph AgF-I, which adopts a cubic crystal system with space group &quot;Fmm&quot; in the Hermann–Mauguin notation. The rock salt structure is adopted by the other silver monohalides. The lattice parameter is 4.936(1) Å, significantly lower than those of AgCl and AgBr. Neutron and X-ray diffraction studies have further shown that at 2.70(2) GPa, a structural transition occurs to a second polymorph (AgF-II) with the caesium chloride structure, and lattice parameter 2.945 Å. The associated decrease in volume is approximately ten percent. A third polymorph, AgF-III, forms on reducing the pressure to 2.59(2) GPa, and has an inverse nickel arsenide structure. The lattice parameters are a = 3.244(2) Å and c = 6.24(1) Å; the rock salt structure is regained only on reduction of the pressure to 0.9(1) GPa. Non-stochiometric behaviour is exhibited by all three polymorphs under extreme pressures.

=== Spectroscopy ===
Silver(I) fluoride exhibits unusual optical properties. Simple electronic band theory predicts that the fundamental exciton absorption for AgF would lie higher than that of AgCl (5.10 eV) and would correspond to a transition from an anionic valence band as for the other silver halides. Experimentally, the fundamental exciton for AgF lies at 4.63 eV. This discrepancy can be explained by positing transition from a valence band with largely silver 4d-orbital character. The high frequency refractive index is 1.73(2).

=== Photosensitivity ===
In contrast with the other silver halides, anhydrous silver(I) fluoride is not appreciably photosensitive, although the dihydrate is. With this and the material&#x27;s solubility in water considered, it is unsurprising that it has found little application in photography but may have been one of the salts used by Levi Hill in his &quot;heliochromy&quot;, although a US patent for an experimental AgF-based method was granted in 1970.

=== Solubility ===
Unlike the other silver halides, AgF is highly soluble in water (1800 g/L), and it even has some solubility in acetonitrile. It is also unique among silver(I) compounds and the silver halides in that it forms the hydrates AgF·(H2O)2 and AgF·(H2O)4 on precipitation from aqueous solution. Like the alkali metal fluorides, it dissolves in hydrogen fluoride to give a conducting solution.

== Applications ==

=== Organic synthesis ===
Silver(I) fluoride finds application in organofluorine chemistry for addition of fluoride across multiple bonds. For example, AgF adds to perfluoroalkenes in acetonitrile to give perfluoroalkylsilver(I) derivatives. It can also be used as a desulfuration-fluorination reagent on thiourea derived substrates. Due to its high solubility in water and organic solvents, it is a convenient source of fluoride ions, and can be used to fluorinate alkyl halides under mild conditions. An example is given by the following reaction:

Another organic synthetic method using silver(I) fluoride is the BINAP-AgF complex catalyzed enantioselective protonation of silyl enol ethers:

=== Inorganic synthesis ===
The reaction of silver acetylide with a concentrated solution of silver(I) fluoride results in the formation of a chandelier-like [Ag10]2+ cluster with endohedral acetylenediide.

Tetralkylammonium fluorides can be conveniently prepared in the laboratory by the reaction of the tetralkylammonium bromide with an aqueous AgF solution.

=== Other ===

It is possible to coat a silicon surface with a uniform silver microlayer (0.1 to 1 μm thickness) by passing AgF vapour over it at 60–800 °C. The relevant reaction is:

Multiple studies have shown silver(I) fluoride to be an effective anti-caries agent, although the mechanism is the subject of current research. Treatment is typically by the &quot;atraumatic&quot; method, in which 40% by mass aqueous silver(I) fluoride solution is applied to carious leisons, followed by sealing of the dentine with glass ionomer cement. Although the treatment is generally recognised to be safe, fluoride toxicity has been a significant clinical concern in paediatric applications, especially as some commercial preparations have had considerable silver(II) fluoride contamination in the past. Due to the instability of concentrated AgF solutions, silver diammine fluoride (Ag(NH3)2F) is now more commonly used. Preparation is by the addition of ammonia to aqueous silver fluoride solution or by the dissolution of silver fluoride in aqueous ammonia.

<doc id="1151602" wikidata="Q881673" url="?curid=1151602" title="Doyle E. Carlton">
<text>Doyle Elam Carlton, Sr. (July 6, 1885 – October 25, 1972) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 25th Governor of the state of Florida from 1929 to 1933.

==Early life==
Doyle Elam Carlton, the son of Albert and Martha Winfield McEwen Carlton, was born in Wauchula, Florida on July 6, 1885. He was born eighth out of ten children. He received his primary education in Wauchula and, as there was then no local high school, attended Stetson Academy where he served as an editor for the school newspaper and officer of the Phi Kappa Delta Society (later to become Delta Sigma Phi). He subsequently graduated from the Liberal Arts College of Stetson University with an A.B. in 1909. Doyle then attended The University of Chicago where he received an A.B. in 1910. He earned his L.L.B. in 1912 from Columbia University. In 1912, he was admitted to the practice of law in Florida and practiced law in Tampa beginning in that year. On July 30, 1912, in Tampa, Doyle married Nell Ray, daughter of Edward Dennis and Mary Ellen Smith Ray.

==Early political career==
His political career began in 1916 when he was elected to the Florida state senate for a two-year term as the State Senator from the 11th District, composed of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.

After serving in the State Senate, Carlton would serve as Tampa&#x27;s city attorney from 1925 to 1927. William J. Howey would claim during his gubernatorial campaign run in 1928 that Carlton would get large fees from selling municipal bonds when he was attorney and dodged serving in World War I.

==1928 Gubernatorial election==
In the Democratic primary on June 5, 1928 he received 77,569 first choice and 28,471 second choice votes to win in a field of five candidates, who included former Governor Sidney J. Catts. In November 1928, Doyle defeated his Republican opponent, William John Howey, by a margin of 148,455 votes to 95,018 votes. He assumed the office of governor on January 8, 1929. During Carlton&#x27;s campaign he ran on the platform of &quot;good government, good schools, and good roads&quot;.

== Governorship ==
During his term, he faced several financial problems caused by the Great Depression which begun under his term. He had to reduce payrolls and cut many state jobs in an attempt to reduce the state&#x27;s budget. Carlton would also support more banking regulations. He would even personally reduce his own salary as governor from $9,000 to $7,500.

During his tenure as governor the state would face several other issues such as: the collapse of the state&#x27;s land boom, a violent hurricane hit the state and a Mediterranean Tephritidae infestation. He left office on January 3, 1933, returning to Tampa, Florida.

Although Carlton was against inheritance and income taxes along with legalizing parimutuel betting, a three cent gas tax would be created during his term in order to help with the construction of highways. A tax commission and purchasing agency would be established in order to combat overspending in the state government. In 1931, a bill legalizing pari-mutuel betting would be passed despite Carlton&#x27;s veto. Despite this, the legislature would nullify it by a margin of one state senator&#x27;s vote as many members of the state legislature were desperate for more income for the state.

== Post-gubernatorial political career and life ==
In 1936, Governor Carlton ran for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator. Although he was endorsed by the Democratic executive committee and most state newspapers, Charles O. Andrews lined up a powerful bloc of forces opposed to Carlton, and by a margin of 67,387 votes to 62,530 votes defeated Governor Carlton in the primary of August 11, 1936.

=== Eisenhower administration ===
President Eisenhower would appoint Carlton as a member of the Commission on Civil Rights in December 1957 staying there until 1961. After leaving the Commission on Civil Rights, he would serve as a member of the National Agricultural Advisory Commission starting in 1961 and leaving the advisory commission in 1963.

==Personal life==
On July 30, 1912, Carlton married Nell Ray in Tampa. He died in Tampa in 1972 and was buried at Myrtle Hill Memorial Park in Tampa. They had three children, Martha Katharine Carlton Ward, Mary Ellen Carlton Ott, and Doyle Elam Carlton, Jr., all of whom are deceased. The latter served as a state senator and ran for Governor of Florida in 1960, but was defeated in the Democratic primary run-off election by C. Farris Bryant.

<doc id="1151604" wikidata="Q580252" url="?curid=1151604" title="Macrolepidoptera">
<text>Macrolepidoptera is a group within the insect order Lepidoptera. Traditionally used for the larger butterflies and moths as opposed to the &quot;microlepidoptera&quot;, this group is artificial. However, it seems that by moving some taxa about, a monophyletic macrolepidoptera can be easily achieved. The two superfamilies Geometroidea and Noctuoidea account for roughly one-quarter of all known Lepidoptera. 

==Taxonomy==
In the reformed macrolepidoptera, the following superfamilies are included:
* Mimallonoidea – sack bearers
* Lasiocampoidea – lappet moths
* Bombycoidea – bombycoid moths
* Noctuoidea – owlet moths
* Drepanoidea – drepanids
* Geometroidea – inchworms
* Calliduloidea – Old World butterfly-moths
* Papilionoidea – butterflies

The last two or three superfamilies comprised the Rhopalocera, or butterflies. More recent taxonomic treatments usually include all butterflies in an expanded Papilionoidea.

Subsequent molecular studies have failed to recover the macrolepidoptera as a monophyletic group, but have found a well supported clade of moths that excludes the butterflies and some other moth superfamilies. This macro-moth clade, named Macroheterocera, contains the following five or six superfamilies:

* Mimallonoidea – sack bearers (sometimes included in basal position)
* Drepanoidea – drepanids
* Noctuoidea – owlet moths
* Geometroidea – inchworms
* Lasiocampoidea – lappet moths
* Bombycoidea – bombycoid moths

<doc id="1151606" wikidata="Q1403609" url="?curid=1151606" title="RAAF Base Richmond">
<text>RAAF Base Richmond is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) military air base located within the City of Hawkesbury, approximately North-West of the Sydney Central Business District in New South Wales, Australia. Situated between the towns of Windsor and Richmond, the base is the oldest base in New South Wales and the second oldest in Australia. The base is home to the transport headquarters RAAF Air Lift Group, and its major operational formations, Nos. 84 and 86 Wings. The main aircraft type operated at the base is the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Richmond is a regular venue for air shows and had at times been mooted as a site for Sydney&#x27;s proposed second international airport.

Sited on a piece of land originally known as Ham Common, Richmond became an RAAF base in 1925. Its inaugural commander was Flight Lieutenant (later Squadron Leader) Frank Lukis, who also led the base&#x27;s first flying unit, No. 3 Squadron. Many other squadrons were formed at Richmond in the ensuing years, as well as a separate Station Headquarters and No. 2 Aircraft Depot in 1936. The base expanded further during World War II, with more squadrons and other units being established there, including No. 1 (Fighter) Wing and No. 3 RAAF Hospital. It was not until after the war that it became the RAAF&#x27;s transport hub, with the arrival of No. 86 Wing and its complement of C-47 Dakotas. The base began operating the Hercules in 1958, augmented in later years by the DHC-4 Caribou and Boeing 707.

==History==
A military flying school was set up at the site of the present-day RAAF base on 28 August 1916, when the area was known as Ham Common. RAAF Station Richmond was established on 30 June 1925 as the fledgling service&#x27;s first air base outside Victoria. Its initial flying unit was No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, operating Airco DH.9 light bombers and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, and for the next decade the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron was also in charge of the base. Among these were Squadron Leaders Frank Lukis (1925–30), Harry Cobby (1930–31), and Bill Bostock (1931–33). Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond was formed as a separate entity on 20 April 1936, under the command of Group Captain Adrian &quot;King&quot; Cole. Other units, including No. 22 Squadron flying Hawker Demons, and No. 2 Aircraft Depot, had been established in the preceding months. No. 4 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron was formed in May 1937, followed by No. 6 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in March 1939. Two Fleet Cooperation units were also established, No. 5 Squadron in April 1936 and No. 9 Squadron in January 1939. No. 23 (General Purpose) Squadron formed in February 1939. As well as an Air Force base, in its pre-war days Richmond was used as a supplementary airport for Sydney; various aviation pioneers employed it in the 1930s, including Charles Kingsford Smith and Jean Batten.

Commanded by Group Captain Hippolyte &quot;Kanga&quot; De La Rue, Richmond&#x27;s combat units at the outbreak of World War II included No. 3 Squadron (flying Hawker Demons), Nos. 6 and 22 Squadrons (Avro Ansons), and No. 9 Squadron (Supermarine Seagulls). On 4 September 1939, the day after Australia declared war, the base&#x27;s first wartime sortie took place, a flight of three Ansons and three Seagulls patrolling the ocean off Sydney. Richmond expanded significantly during the war, and many flying units originated there including No. 11 Squadron in September 1939, No. 30 (Beaufighter) Squadron and No. 100 (Beaufort) Squadron in March 1942, No. 54 Squadron RAF in August 1942, No. 452 Squadron RAF in September 1942, No. 1 (Fighter) Wing in October 1942, and No. 84 (Boomerang) Squadron in February 1943. Several auxiliaries were also formed including training schools, salvage units, and over thirty radar stations. No. 2 Recruit Depot came into being in January 1940, and the resultant expansion of temporary accommodation resulted in a &quot;tin city&quot; on the fringes of the base. The Australian Army also utilised the base for parachute training. No. 3 RAAF Hospital was established in October 1940. Following the war, Richmond became home to most of the RAAF&#x27;s transport aircraft. No. 86 (Transport) Wing, made up of Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons flying C-47 Dakotas, arrived from RAAF Station Schofields in June 1949. The wing relocated to Canberra in 1954, but returned to Richmond four years later. No. 11 Squadron, which had disbanded in 1946, returned to Richmond in 1954 operating P-2 Neptune maritime reconnaissance aircraft, and remained until transferring to RAAF Base Edinburgh, South Australia in 1968.

Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond was formed in April 1952 to replace the former Station Headquarters, along with a subordinate unit, Base Squadron Richmond, for the day-to-day running of the establishment. The base was evacuated in February 1956 due to the threat of rising floodwaters nearby, the only time in its history that flooding in the Hawkesbury region became serious enough to warrant such action. In 1958–59, No. 36 Squadron began operating its first C-130 Hercules heavy transports, which were augmented by No. 38 Squadron&#x27;s DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in 1964. No. 86 Wing was disbanded in August that year, but reformed in February 1987, under the newly established Headquarters Air Lift Group that replaced the former Base Headquarters. At the same time, Base Squadron was reformed as Base Support Wing. No. 86 Wing took control of No. 33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 jet tanker/transports, as well as Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, flying Hercules. No. 486 Maintenance Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit (AMTDU) were also under its aegis at Richmond. The Hercules, Caribous and 707s became synonymous with disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region, as well as deploying on overseas peacekeeping missions. Richmond was the venue for many air shows including, in 1988, the largest staged in Australia to that date, celebrating the Australian Bicentenary. The base also staged the RAAF&#x27;s 70th Anniversary Air show in 1991, the same year that the Hercules achieved 500,000 accident-free hours of operation.

By the early 2000s, No. 33 Squadron had been transferred to the recently re-established No. 84 Wing, and AMTDU to No. 85 Wing, while the Base Support Wing had been superseded by Combat Support Unit Richmond. No. 36 Squadron, having transferred its C-130Hs to No. 37 Squadron and re-equipped with the C-17 Globemaster, relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in November 2006. The RAAF&#x27;s DHC-4 Caribous, which had been operated for some years by No. 38 Squadron out of RAAF Base Townsville, were retired at the end of 2009, to be replaced by Super King Airs built by Hawker Pacific. No. 37 Squadron was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing on 1 October 2010. In January 2013, No. 35 Squadron was re-formed at Richmond, under the control of No. 84 Wing. Initially a cadre, the squadron will expand to approximately 250 personnel by 2015, when it will begin operating the RAAF&#x27;s ten C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.

In the 1980s, RAAF Base Richmond had been strongly considered as a second international airport for Sydney, but no decision was taken at the time. By 2009, it was reported as being the New South Wales Government&#x27;s preferred location for a secondary airport, but that any decision on a location would be the Federal Government&#x27;s responsibility. In July 2012, the Federal Government decided against Richmond as a second airport, but had commissioned a study into whether the base could be employed for &quot;limited civil operations&quot;. In September 2016 the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Leo Davies, stated that the RAAF favoured closing RAAF Base Richmond during the next 15 years as its functions had been declining, and the major investment in infrastructure needed to bring it to a &quot;fighting state&quot; could be better spent upgrading other bases. However, Minister for Defence Marise Payne stated that the Government was not considering closing the base.

In 2014, the NSW Rural Fire Service began using Richmond as a base for its Large Air Tanker (LAT) and Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) program. During the Australian summer, the NSW RFS will have a variety of aircraft available including a C-130 Hercules, Avro RJ85, Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 as well as smaller lead-in aircraft. As of 2019, the NSW RFS has purchased its own Boeing 737 which is now permanently based at Richmond.

<doc id="1151608" wikidata="Q302987" url="?curid=1151608" title="Chorale prelude">
<text>In music, a chorale prelude or chorale setting is a short liturgical composition for organ using a chorale tune as its basis. It was a predominant style of the German Baroque era and reached its culmination in the works of J.S. Bach, who wrote 46 (with a 47th unfinished) examples of the form in his Orgelbüchlein, along with multiple other works of the type in other collections.

==Function==
The precise liturgical function of a chorale prelude in the Baroque period is uncertain and is a subject of debate. One possibility is that they were used to introduce the hymn about to be sung by the congregation, usually in a Protestant, and originally in a Lutheran, church. This assumption may be valid for the shorter chorale preludes (Bach&#x27;s setting of &#x27;Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier, BWV 731, for example), but many chorale preludes are very long. It could be the case that these were played during special services in churches or in cathedrals.

==Style==
Chorale preludes are typically polyphonic settings, with a chorale tune, plainly audible and often ornamented, used as cantus firmus. Accompanying motifs are usually derived from contrapuntal manipulations of the chorale melody.

Notable composers of chorale preludes during the Baroque period include Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel and Johann Sebastian Bach. After this period, the form fell out of favour and virtually none were written by subsequent composers, such as Stamitz, J C Bach, Haydn and Mozart, until examples from the late 19th century, including works by Johannes Brahms and Max Reger.

==Baroque period==

Among the old masters who wrote chorale preludes is Samuel Scheidt. His &quot;Tabulatura Nova&quot;, containing several such works, was published in 1624. Sweelinck is also typical of the early Baroque period.

Chorale preludes also appear in the works of Dieterich Buxtehude and Georg Böhm. Over 40 chorale preludes by Buxtehude have survived to this day.

Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s compositions are another example of the form, with many of his chorale preludes elaborating upon Protestant chorale melodies.

The best-known composer of chorale preludes is Johann Sebastian Bach. His earliest extant compositions, works for organ which he possibly wrote before his fifteenth birthday, include the chorale preludes BWV 700, 724, 1091, 1094, 1097, 1112, 1113 and 1119.

In Bach&#x27;s early &quot;Orgelbüchlein&quot; (1708-1717), the chorale melody is usually in the upper part and the accompanying lower parts, while being highly elaborate in their harmonic and contrapuntal detail, the beginnings and endings of phrases generally coincide with those of the chorale. An example is &quot;Jesu, meine Freude&quot;, where the chorale melody in the upper part is supported by a closely woven and harmonically subtle counterpoint in three parts:

Peter Williams (1972, p. 27) says of the &quot;Orgelbüchlein&quot;: “Each approach to Bach’s organ chorales – their beauty, their ‘symbolism’, their mastery- is rewarding.” Williams continues (1972, p29) “One of the most remarkable features of most of the settings is that the accompaniment and the motifs from which it is composed are newly invented and are not related thematically to the melody.”

By contrast, in the prelude on &quot;&quot; (BWV 645) from the set of six Schübler Chorales, taken from earlier cantata movements, the accompaniment is a free-flowing obbligato which both derives from the chorale melody, yet seems to float independently over it. &quot;The achieving of a melody independent of the cantus firmus, though in principle it is familiar in obbligato arias, is here unusually complete.&quot; Julian Mincham (2010) sees an asymmetry here that is possibly rooted in the chorale itself “with its slightly puzzling mixture of different phrase lengths”:

Two melodic ideas from the chorale, labelled (a) and (b) above are embedded in the obbligato line:

Mincham says that while “theme and chorale are not designed to begin and end together… [they] fit together perfectly. Get to know the chorale and ritornello melodies well and the apparently effortless ways in which they inter-relate will become obvious. The important point is that they seem not to fit; but they do.”

==Romantic period and twentieth century==

There are several examples of 19th- and 20th-century chorale preludes, such as the Eleven Chorale Preludes by Johannes Brahms, César Franck, Max Reger&#x27;s and Samuel Barber&#x27;s. Works such as these continue to be produced nowadays such as Helmut Walcha&#x27;s four volumes and the seven volumes of Flor Peeters.

<text>The Europa Bridge or Bridge of Europe (&quot;Europabrücke&quot;) is a bridge carrying the A13 Brenner Autobahn (and European route E45) over the Wipp valley just south of Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria. The bridge spans the Sill River, and forms part of the main route across the Alps from western Austria to South Tyrol in Italy. It is also part of the main route between southeastern Germany and northern Italy.

The longest span between pillars is .

It hosts a 192-meter Bungee Jump, the fifth highest in the world.

==Record==
Built between 1959 and 1963 and standing high above the ground, it took the title of Europe&#x27;s highest bridge, surpassing the Gueuroz Bridge in Switzerland. The Italia Viaduct took over this title in 1974.
