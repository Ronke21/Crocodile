<text>Substitutionary atonement, also called vicarious atonement, is a central concept within Western Christian theology which asserts that Jesus died for humanity, as claimed by the Western classic and paradigms of atonement in Christianity, which regard Jesus as dying as a substitute for others.

Substitutionary atonement has been explicated in the &quot;classic paradigm&quot; of the Early Church Fathers, namely the ransom theory, as well as in Gustaf Aulen&#x27;s reformulation, the Christus Victor theory; and in the &quot;objective paradigm,&quot; which includes Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s satisfaction theory, the Reformed period&#x27;s penal substitution theory, and the Governmental theory of atonement.

==Definition==
Substitutionary atonement, also called vicarious atonement, is the idea that Jesus died &quot;for us&quot;. There is also a less technical use of the term &quot;substitution&quot; in discussion about atonement when it is used in &quot;the sense that [Jesus, through his death,] did for us that which we can never do for ourselves&quot;.

The English word &quot;&quot; originally meant &quot;at-one-ment&quot;, i.e. being &quot;at one&quot;, in harmony, with someone. According to Collins English Dictionary, it is used to describe the redemption through Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection, to reconcile the world to himself, and also of the state of a person having been reconciled to God.

The word &quot;atonement&quot; is often used in the Old Testament to translate the Hebrew words &quot;kipper&quot; and &quot;kippurim&quot;, which mean &#x27;propitiation&#x27; or &#x27;expiation&#x27;. The word occurs in the KJV in and has the basic meaning of &quot;reconciliation&quot;. In the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible or Tanakh), atonement was accomplished by the sacrifice of specified animals such as lambs to pay for one&#x27;s sins.

A distinction has to be made between substitutionary atonement (Christ suffers for us), and penal substitution (Christ punished instead of us), which is a subset or particular type of substitutionary atonement. Care should be taken when one reads the language of substitution in, for example, patristic literature, not to assume any particular substitution model is being used but should, rather, check the context to see how the author was using the language.

==Origins==

===Jewish scriptures===
According to Pate, the Jewish scriptures describe three types of vicarious atonement: the Paschal Lamb although the Paschal Lamb was not a sin offering; &quot;the sacrificial system as a whole&quot;, although these were for &quot;mistakes&quot;, not intentional sins and with the Day of Atonement as the most essential element; and the idea of the suffering servant (Isaiah 42:1-9, 49:1-6, 50:4-11, 52:13-53:12). The Old Testament Deuterocanon added a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2-5).

These traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness, and &quot;korbanot&quot; (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin. In addition, &quot;korbanot&quot; have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a &quot;payment for sin,&quot; but had a basic meaning as &quot;making something sacred by giving it as a gift to God,&quot; and included a shared meal with God. Sacrifices had numerous purposes, namely thanksgiving, petition, purification, and reconciliation. None of them were a &quot;payment or substitution or satisfaction,&quot; and even &quot;sacrifices of reconciliation were about restoring the relationship.&quot;

The idea that Jesus was predicted by Isaiah is attested in Luke 4:16-22, where Jesus is portrayed as saying that the prophesies in Isaiah were about him. In he refers to himself, and the Gospel of Matthew also applies that chapter to him ().

James F. McGrath refers to , &quot;which presents a martyr praying “Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them. Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs” (4 Maccabees 6:28-29). Clearly there were ideas that existed in the Judaism of the time that helped make sense of the death of the righteous in terms of atonement.&quot;

===Paul===
 contains the &quot;kerygma&quot; of the early Christians: 
The meaning of this &quot;kerygma&quot; is a matter of debate, and open to multiple interpretations. Traditionally, this &quot;kerygma&quot; is interpreted as meaning that Jesus&#x27; death was an atonement or ransom for, or propitiation or expiation of, God&#x27;s wrath against humanity because of their sins. With Jesus&#x27; death, humanity was freed from this wrath. In the classical Protestant understanding humans partake in this salvation by faith in Jesus Christ; this faith is a grace given by God, and people are justified by God through Jesus Christ and faith in Him.

More recent scholarship has raised several concerns regarding these interpretations. The traditional interpretation sees Paul&#x27;s understanding of salvation as involving &quot;an exposition of the individual&#x27;s relation to God.&quot; According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul&#x27;s writings on Jesus&#x27; role, and salvation by faith, is not the individual conscience of human sinners, and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the problem of the inclusion of Gentile (Greek) Torah observers into God&#x27;s covenant. Paul draws on several interpretative frames to solve this problem, but most importantly, his own experience and understanding. 

The &quot;kerygma&quot; from 1:Cor.15:3-5 refers to two mythologies: the Greek myth of the noble dead, to which the Maccabean notion of martyrdom and dying for ones people is related; and the Jewish myth of the persecuted sage or righteous man, in particular the &quot;story of the child of wisdom.&quot; The notion of &#x27;dying for&#x27; refers to this martyrdom and persecution. &#x27;Dying for our sins&#x27; refers to the problem of Gentile Torah-observers, who, despite their faithfulness, cannot fully observe commandments, including circumcision, and are therefore &#x27;sinners&#x27;, excluded from God&#x27;s covenant. In the Jerusalem &quot;ekklēsia&quot;, from which Paul received this creed, the phrase &quot;died for our sins&quot; probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of God&#x27;s plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. For Paul, it gained a deeper significance, providing &quot;a basis for the salvation of sinful Gentiles apart from the Torah.&quot; Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection solved this problem of the exclusion of the Gentiles from God&#x27;s covenant, as indicated by Rom 3:21–26.

==Substitutionary atonement theories==
===Theories of atonement===
A number of metaphors and Old Testament terms and references have been used in the New Testament writings to understand the person and death of Jesus. Starting in the second century CE, various theories of atonement have been posited to explain the death of Jesus, and the metaphors applied by the New Testament to understand his death. Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas about how Jesus saved people, and different views still exist within different Christian denominations.

According to C. Marvin Pate, &quot;there are three aspects to Christ&#x27;s atonement according to the early Church: vicarious atonement [substitutionary atonement], the escatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection].&quot; Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times. Due to the influence of Gustaf Aulèn&#x27;s (1879-1978) &quot;Christus Victor&quot;, the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testamentical writings are often grouped as &quot;classic paradigm,&quot; &quot;objective paradigm,&quot; and the &quot;subjective paradigm&quot;:

Substitutionary atonement has been explicated in the &quot;classic paradigm&quot; of the Early Church Fathers, namely the ransom theory, as well as in Gustaf Aulen&#x27;s reformulation, the Christus Victor theory; and in the &quot;objective paradigm,&quot; which includes Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s satisfaction theory, the Reformed period&#x27;s penal substitution theory, and the Governmental theory of atonement.

===Classic paradigm===
According to Yeo, the 
Pate differentiates the &quot;Christ the Victor&quot;-theme from the &quot;vicarious atonement&quot;-theme, both of which can be found in early Christianity.

The ransom theory presents Jesus as dying to overcome (supernatural) powers of sin and evil. In this model, the Devil has ownership over humanity (because they have sinned) so Jesus dies in their place to free them. The doctrine is that Jesus gave himself as a ransom sacrifice on behalf of the people. This is known as the oldest of the theories of the atonement, and is, in some form, still, along with the doctrine of theosis, the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s main theory of the atonement.

Many of the Church Fathers, including Justin Martyr, Athanasius and Augustine incorporate the ransom theory of atonement into their writings. The specific interpretation as to what this suffering for sinners meant differed to some extent. It is widely held that the early Church Fathers, including Athanasius and Augustine, taught that through Christ&#x27;s vicarious suffering in humanity&#x27;s place, he overcame and liberated humanity from sin, death, and the Devil.

Gustaf Aulén reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study &quot;Christus Victor&quot; (1931), calling it the Christus Victor doctrine, arguing that Christ&#x27;s death was not a payment to the Devil (Satan), but defeated the powers of evil, particularly Satan, which had held humankind in their dominion. According to Ben Pugh, &quot;Ever since [Aulén&#x27;s] time, we call these patristic ideas the &quot;Christus Victor&quot; way of seeing the cross.&quot;

===Objective paradigm===
While the idea of substitutionary atonement is present in nearly all atonement theories, some argue that the specific ideas of satisfaction and penal substitution are later developments in the Catholic church and in Calvinism, respectively. Both Anselm&#x27;s satisfaction theory and the penal satisfaction theory hold that human beings cannot rightfully repay the debt (to God&#x27;s honour [Anselm], or to God&#x27;s justice [penal substitution]) which was incurred through their willful disobedience to God. Since only God can make the satisfaction necessary to repay it, rather than merely forgiving humanity, God sent the God-man, Jesus Christ, to fulfill both these conditions. Christ is a sacrifice by God on behalf of humanity, taking humanity&#x27;s debt for sin upon himself, and propitiating God&#x27;s wrath. The penal substitution theory has been rejected by liberal Christians as un-Biblical, and an offense to the love of God. According to Richard Rohr, &quot;[t]hese theories are based on &quot;retributive&quot; justice rather than the &quot;restorative&quot; justice that the prophets and Jesus taught.&quot;

The Governmental theory, introduced by Hugo Grotius (17th century), states that Christ suffered for humanity so that God could forgive humans without punishing them while still maintaining divine justice. Jesus&#x27; death demonstrated God&#x27;s hatred of sin, and thus God&#x27;s law (his rule, his government) is upheld (people see that sin is serious and will lead to death), and God forgives people who recognise this and respond through repentance. The governmental theory rejects the notion of penal substitution, but is still substitutionary itself in that Christ, in his exemplary sufferings, substituted for believers and the punishment they would otherwise receive.

===Other substitutionary models===
There are a number of other substitutionary theories of the atonement besides the four described above. A few are listed below:
* John McLeod Campbell (&quot;The nature of the Atonement&quot; [1856]): &#x27;Campbell rejects the idea of vicarious punishment [...And] Taking a hint from Jonathan Edwards, ... develops the idea that Christ, as representative and complete man, was able to offer a vicarious repentance to God for men.&#x27;
* Horace Bushnell (&quot;The Vicarious Sacrifice&quot; [1866]): Bushnell rejected penal substitution and, instead, speaks of Christ as &#x27;my sacrifice, who opens all to me&#x27;. &#x27;Beholding Him with all my sin upon Him&#x27;, he says, &#x27;I count Him my offering...&#x27;
* Vincent Taylor (&quot;The Cross of Christ&quot; [1956]): &#x27;...in St. Paul&#x27;s teaching Christ&#x27;s death is substitutionary in the sense that He did for us that which we can never do for ourselves, but not in the sense that He transfers our punishment to Himself...&#x27; (p. 31). While rejecting as pagan the notion that Jesus&#x27; death propitiates the Father (p. 91), he talks of Jesus&#x27; sacrifice as vicarious, representative and sacrificial (p. 90), and says that for Jesus &#x27;sacrifice is a representative offering in which men can share, making it the vehicle or organ of their approach to God&#x27; (p. 21). Taylor called this theory the &#x27;Sacrificial Theory&#x27; (p. 104).
* F. W. Camfield (‘The Idea of Substitution in the Doctrine of the Atonement’ in &quot;SJT&quot; I [1948] 282-293): in his 1948 paper, Camfield spells out &#x27;a non-penal view of substitution&#x27;.

== Belief in substitutionary atonement ==
Eastern Christians do not incorporate substitutionary atonement in their doctrine of the cross and resurrection. The Western part of the Catholic Church incorporates it into Aquinas&#x27; satisfaction doctrine rooted in the idea of penance. Most Evangelical Protestants interpret it largely in terms of penal substitution.

<doc id="1180178" wikidata="Q382088" url="?curid=1180178" title="TUX web server">
<text>The TUX web server is an unmaintained in-kernel web server for Linux licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It was maintained by Ingo Molnár.

It was limited to serving static web pages and coordinating between kernelspace modules, userspace modules, and regular userspace web server daemons that provide dynamic content. Regular userspace web servers do not need to be altered in any way for TUX to coordinate with them. However, userspace code has to use a new interface based on the codice_1 system call.

== Comparison with traditional web servers ==
The main differences between TUX and other webservers include:
*TUX runs partly within a customized version of the Linux kernel and partly as a userspace daemon.
*With a capable network card, TUX enables scatter-gather DMA from the page cache directly to the network.
*TUX is only able to serve static web pages.

While only being able to serve static web pages could be seen as a significant disadvantage, TUX has one significant advantage: it is able to serve pages more efficiently than traditional web servers by to running directly within the kernel and avoiding data copies. However, this also means that TUX does not generate dynamic content. Because it is running within the kernel, such dynamic content cannot take advantage of functions that the kernel provides to userspace programs, and would create tremendous security issues.

TUX is capable of launching CGI programs to provide dynamic content. However, the CGI application needs to be modified to support Tux. Also, CGI suffers from significant performance limitations, so a CGI-heavy site would gain no performance advantage from using TUX. TUX can also redirect any request it cannot process to a traditional userspace web server daemon, for example Apache or lighttpd. This allows TUX to handle both dynamic content and errors in a safer, faster, and RFC-correct manner.

TUX has never been an integrated part of the official Linux kernel, although it was shipped in some distributions, notably Red Hat, SuSE and Fedora. It served as a test bed (and motivator) for many features which were integrated separately. One major component was the Native POSIX Thread Library, which, with the right tuning parameters, allows userspace web servers to serve web pages at a speed very close to that of a kernelspace web server like TUX but without its limitations. Core kernel developers also argued that having an HTTP daemon within the kernel is dangerous. For example, a common bug such as a buffer overflow within TUX could give an attacker superuser control over the machine. Therefore, it is much safer to keep the HTTP daemon entirely within userspace, where a bug does not necessarily give an attacker total control.

<doc id="1180190" wikidata="Q17092776" url="?curid=1180190" title="Itoh–Tsujii inversion algorithm">
<text>While the algorithm is often called the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm, it was first presented by Feng.
Feng&#x27;s paper was received on March 13, 1987 and published in October 1989. Itoh and Tsujii&#x27;s paper was received on July 8, 1987 and published in 1988.

Feng and Itoh-Tsujii algorithm is first used to invert elements in finite field using 
the normal basis representation of elements, however, it is generic and can be used for other bases, 
such as the polynomial basis. It can also be used in any finite field .

The algorithm is as follows:
: Input: &quot;A&quot; ∈ GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;)
: Output: &quot;A&quot;−1
:# &quot;r&quot; ← (&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; − 1)/(&quot;p&quot; − 1)
:# compute &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot;−1 in GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;) 
:# compute &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot; = &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot;−1 · &quot;A&quot;
:# compute (&quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot;)−1 in GF(&quot;p&quot;)
:# compute &quot;A&quot;−1 = (&quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot;)−1 · &quot;A&quot;&quot;r&quot;−1
:# return &quot;A&quot;−1

This algorithm is fast because steps 3 and 5 both involve operations in the subfield GF(&quot;p&quot;). Similarly, if a small value of &quot;p&quot; is used, a lookup table can be used for inversion in step 4. The majority of time spent in this algorithm is in step 2, the first exponentiation. This is one reason why this algorithm is well suited for the normal basis, since squaring and exponentiation are relatively easy in that basis.

This algorithm is based on the fact that is a cyclic group of order .
Given a nonzero element in finite field , we have
formula_1

The above expression itself is close to that of the multiplicative Norm function in finite field, which is defined as 
formula_2

This viewpoint leads us to consider the additive absolute Trace function

, which is defined as 
formula_3

If =0, then we have 
formula_4
and can express as
formula_5

In some s, for example, used in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), this formula needs 1 less
multiplication operation than Feng and Itoh-Tsujii algorithm for elements with Trace value 0:
because 
formula_6
we have 
formula_7
and
formula_8

This additive formula needs 3 multiplications, 4 additions and 6 squarings.

But the multiplicative formula 
formula_9
needs 4 multiplications and 7 squarings.

<text>Jamie Peter Robinson (born 7 April 1980 in Penarth, Wales) is a retired Wales international rugby union footballer who played at outside centre. He attended Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf with younger brother Nicky Robinson. He speaks Welsh fluently.

Robinson came to prominence playing for the Cardiff Blues. He played for Wales Under 19s, Under 21s, Wales A and played in the Youth World Cup in 1999 when Wales reached the final, losing to New Zealand along with fellow Cardiff Blues player Rhys Williams. Before playing his first match for Wales against Japan in 2001 where he scored a try on his debut. He maintained a place in the Wales squad until he was injured.

He suffered a long lay off through a knee injury at the beginning of the 2004–05 Celtic League, returning to action in the middle of the 2005–06 Celtic League. He immediately recovered his best form, leading to him gaining a place in the Wales squad to Argentina where he started both tests scoring one try. This was not the first time he and his brother Nicky, played together for Wales. They played their first test together against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in August 2003 in a Rugby World Cup warm-up fixture.

Robinson left the Blues following the 2008–09 Magners League, signing with the ambitious Top 14 side Toulon. After the 2009–10 Top 14 season, he was linked with a possible return to the Celtic League with the Italian expansion team Aironi, but ultimately decided to stay in France, signing with newly promoted Agen for the 2010–11 Top 14 season.

After three seasons with Agen, Robinson was forced to end his playing career in May 2013 because of injury, bringing an end to almost 15 years in professional rugby.

<doc id="1180195" wikidata="Q7516350" url="?curid=1180195" title="Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad">
<text>The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad was a railroad running in northern Central Florida. Despite its name, it never directly served Silver Springs but instead ran from Ocala west to Dunnellon and to the Gulf of Mexico at Homosassa. It also had a track that served Inverness from Dunnellon.

==History==
The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad was assigned land grants on March 12, 1879, by the state legislature of Florida. This was accomplished by Florida State Law Chapter 3170. The line was complete between Ocala and Dunellon in 1887 and used to transport phosphate and limestone. It connected with the Florida Southern Railway in Ocala. One of the early organizers of the railroad was John F. Dunn, for whom Dunnellon is partially named for.

The line was extended southwest to Crystal River and Homosassa by 1888. Track was then built from Dunnellon (at a point near Citrus Springs) south to Hernando and Inverness in 1891, which connected with the newly built northern extension of the South Florida Railroad&#x27;s Pemberton Ferry Branch, which continued south to Lakeland. In 1893, track was built from Juliette (near Rainbow Springs) north to Morriston.

By 1901, the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad owned four locomotives. That year, the line became part of the Plant System, which also operated the South Florida Railroad and the Florida Southern Railway. The Plant System had been owned by Florida railroad tycoon Henry B. Plant prior to his death in 1899.

The Plant System was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf network would later be incorporated into the Atlantic Coast Line&#x27;s DuPont—Lakeland Line.

Track between Homosassa and Crystal River was abandoned in 1941. The Atlantic Coast Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967 after merging with their rival, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which then became CSX Transportation in 1986. Track was removed between Crystal River and Red Level by 1982. CSX abandoned the line from Dunnellon to Inverness (along with track from Inverness to Owensboro) in 1987.

==Current conditions==
All former track of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad has been operated by the Florida Northern Railroad since 1988. This includes the now discontinuous segments in Ocala (which is now a short industrial spur) and track from Dunnellon to the Crystal River Energy Complex in Red Level.

State Road 40 runs close to the former right of way between Ocala and Dunnellon.

The line from Dunnellon south to Inverness is now part of the Withlacoochee State Trail, the longest rail trail in Florida.

<doc id="1180221" wikidata="Q1337319" url="?curid=1180221" title="Rebel MC">
<text>Michael Alec Anthony West (born 27 August 1964 in Islington, London, England), better known as Rebel MC and Congo Natty, is a British jungle producer, spiritual chanter and toaster. He has also gone by aliases including Conquering Lion, Blackstar, Tribe of Issachar, Lion of Judah, X Project and Ras Project.

==Biography==
In the late 1980s, West formed the group Double Trouble with Michael Menson, Karl Brown (more commonly known as the UK garage DJ Karl &#x27;Tuff Enuff&#x27; Brown) and Leigh Guest. This would lead to two hip house records reaching the UK Top 40 in 1989 - &quot;Just Keep Rockin&#x27;&quot; followed by &quot;Street Tuff&quot;. The latter reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. These would appear shortly after on his debut album &quot;Rebel Music&quot;.

In 1991, West released his second album, &quot;Black Meaning Good&quot;, which combined his former hip house and pop-rap influences with radical political, spiritual consciousness and a stronger roots reggae, dubwise and breakbeat edge. The album featured notable reggae and dancehall artists such as Barrington Levy, Tenor Fly and Dennis Brown. Singles released from the album included &quot;The Wickedest Sound&quot;, &quot;Comin&#x27; On Strong&quot;, and &quot;Tribal Base&quot; - to which their breakbeat hardcore and reggae fusion would give rise to an early precursor to the jungle sound.

His third album &quot;Word, Sound and Power&quot; (released in 1992) represented further exploration of increasingly politicised awareness, breakbeat hardcore, house, conscious spiritual roots reggae, dubwise, and hip hop, with two singles &quot;Rich Ah Getting Richer&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get No Sleep&quot; released from it. &quot;Rich Ah Getting Richer&quot; was built on melodies and samples from Twinkle Brothers &quot;Jahovia&quot;, Junior Byles and King Tubby&#x27;s&#x27;&quot;Fade Away&quot; as well as Junior Delgado&#x27;s &quot;Tichion.&quot; The track &quot;Jahovia&quot; samples the keyboard hook from the sound system favourite, &quot;Kunta Kinte&quot;. Kunta Kinte, the film character from Alex Haley&#x27;s book &quot;Roots&quot; inspired a reggae riddim of the same name, which started off life as a track called &quot;Beware Of Your Enemies&quot; released from Jamaica&#x27;s Channel One. A dub version, put out in 1976 by Channel One house band The Revolutionaries became a sound system anthem for many years on dubplate, and inspired a UK version produced by Mad Professor in 1981. The track inspired Rebel MC and other jungle covers.

On &quot;Word, Sound and Power&quot; Rebel MC also built tracks around samples and melodies from Yabby You, Lincoln Thompson and the Royal Rasses (&quot;Humanity&quot;) and Burning Spear&#x27;s &quot;Creation Rebel.&quot; 

The track &quot;African&quot; samples Lloyd Coxsone’s &quot;King of the Dub Rock part two&quot;, and Johnny Clarke’s vocals from Bunny Lee productions. 

The album track “Revolution” is largely based on Dennis Brown’s track of the same name. 

Whilst West was enjoying further commercial success with &quot;Tribal Base&quot; featuring Barrington Levy and Tenor Fly, he was also experimenting with white label releases on his X Project label. The first of these would be &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; (which contains samples from &quot;The Snowman&quot; track), followed by a further five releases which by this time were jungle.

West is often noted for having popularised the term &quot;jungle&quot;. In the book &quot;Energy Flash&quot; by Simon Reynolds, MC Navigator of Kool FM is quoted as saying: &quot;Rebel got this chant - &#x27;all the junglists&#x27; - from a yard-tape&quot; (referring to the sound system tapes from Kingston, Jamaica). &quot;When Rebel sampled that, the people cottoned on, and soon they started to call the music &#x27;jungle&#x27;&quot;.

In 1994, West converted to Rastafari. As Conquering Lion, he would release a classic jungle track &quot;Code Red&quot;, with vocals from Super Cat. This was picked up for major release by Mango Records, a subsidiary of Island Records, which was followed by &quot;Champion DJ&quot; (featuring Top Cat) and &quot;Junglist&quot; (featuring Peter Bouncer), both released on his Congo Natty label that would be prolific in the mid-1990s to early 2000s.

In 2013, West returned with the album &quot;Jungle Revolution&quot;, featuring Jah Shaka&#x27;s son, Young Warrior, General Levy, Top Cat, Tippa Irie, Tenor Fly, and Nãnci Correia.

<doc id="1180225" wikidata="Q413309" url="?curid=1180225" title="Pyromorphite">
<text>Pyromorphite is a mineral species composed of lead chlorophosphate: Pb5(PO4)3Cl, sometimes occurring in sufficient abundance to be mined as an ore of lead. Crystals are common, and have the form of a hexagonal prism terminated by the basal planes, sometimes combined with narrow faces of a hexagonal pyramid. Crystals with a barrel-like curvature are not uncommon. Globular and reniform masses are also found. Pyromorphite is part of the apatite group of minerals and bears a close resemblance physically and chemically with two other minerals: mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) and vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl). The resemblance in external characters is so close that, as a rule, it is only possible to distinguish between them by chemical tests. They were formerly confused under the names green lead ore and brown lead ore (&quot;German: Grünbleierz and Braunbleierz&quot;).

The phosphate was first distinguished chemically by M. H. Klaproth in 1784, and it was named pyromorphite by J. F. L. Hausmann in 1813. The name is derived from the Greek for &quot;pyr&quot; (fire) and &quot;morfe&quot; (form) due to its crystallization behavior after being melted.

&quot;Paecilomyces javanicus&quot; is a mold collected from a lead-polluted soil that is able to form biominerals of pyromorphite.

==Properties and isomorphism==
The color of the mineral is usually some bright shade of green, yellow or brown, and the luster is resinous. The hardness is 3.5 to 4, and the specific gravity between 6.5 and 7.1. Owing to isomorphous replacement of the phosphorus by arsenic there may be a gradual passage from pyromorphite to mimetite. Varieties containing calcium isomorphously replacing lead are lower in density (specific gravity 5.9–6.5) and usually lighter in color; they bear the names polysphaerite (because of the globular form), miesite from Stříbro (pronounced &quot;Mies&quot; in German) in Bohemia, nussierite from Nuizière, Chénelette, near Beaujeu, Rhône, France, and cherokine from Cherokee County in Georgia.

<text>River Cottage is a brand used for a number of ventures by television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. These include a long-running Channel 4 television series, cookery courses, events, restaurants and products such as beer and organic yogurts.

There is a River Cottage Kitchen restaurant championing organic and local food near Axminster. River Cottage HQ is a 100-acre farm on the Devon/Dorset border that follows the farm-to-fork ethos through its various endeavours. Among other things these include: cookery, gardening and craft courses, long table dining feasts in the 18th-century threshing barn and the 17th-century farmhouse which appeared in many of the later TV shows has recently been renovated to now host guests on a B&amp;B and whole house rental basis. As well as this, River Cottage HQ holds many private events including parties, meetings and weddings.

==Television series==
The first TV series, &quot;Escape to River Cottage,&quot; was shown on Channel 4. In this show, Fearnley-Whittingstall left London to pursue an ambition of self-sufficiency, growing his own vegetables and raising his own animals at a gamekeeper&#x27;s cottage near Netherbury in Dorset. The series had six episodes and first aired in March and April 1999. It was followed by &quot;Return to River Cottage&quot; in 2000. and &quot;River Cottage Forever&quot; in 2001, in which viewers followed Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s further adventures as a downsized smallholder.

In 2004, the River Cottage brand left the original holiday home to follow Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s progress as he set up a new business from old dairy buildings near Broadoak, Bridport, Dorset in the series &quot;Beyond River Cottage&quot;. An additional series, &quot;The View from River Cottage&quot;, was a combination clip show and retrospective of the previous series.

The 2005 series, &quot;River Cottage Road Trip&quot;, follows Fearnley-Whittingstall as he explores Dumfriesshire, Cumbria and Lozells and East Handsworth, Birmingham for regional recipes that he can bring back home.

In 2006, moved to the Park Farm location near to Uplyme in Devon. Here at the new River Cottage HQ, the team would film the 2006 series &quot;The River Cottage Treatment&quot; where Fearnley-Whittingstall would attempt to convert junk food lovers&#x27; eating habits.

The 2007 series, &quot;River Cottage: Gone Fishing&quot;, saw Fearnley-Whittingstall travel to fishing locations throughout the British Isles in order to promote the culinary benefits of sustainable fishing cultures.

In 2008, Channel 4 began broadcasting &quot;River Cottage Spring&quot;, later followed up by &quot;River Cottage Autumn&quot;, which shows Fearnley-Whittingstall using home-grown produce in recipes. The series also tracks a group of families in Bristol who attempt to convert a large bramble patch into a small-holding, now known as Bramble Farm, growing vegetables, and rearing meat. A four-episode series &quot;River Cottage: Summer&#x27;s Here&quot; began airing in June 2009.

November 2009 saw the broadcasting of a new series titled &quot;River Cottage: Winter&#x27;s on the Way&quot;, following Fearnley-Whittingstall as he grows, forages and cooks winter treats.

In 2010, a new series titled &quot;River Cottage Every Day&quot; was released, each episode concerning the specific topics of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, breakfast, lunch, bread and treats.

During the year 2011 Fearnley-Whittingstall released the series &quot;River Cottage Veg,&quot; documenting his experiences of giving up meat whilst learning about different vegetarian cooking styles.

In July 2012, a new three-part series began on Channel 4, titled &quot;River Cottage: Three Go Mad&quot;. Fearnley-Whittingstall was joined at Park Farm by three celebrities, who wished to increase their knowledge on where their food comes from, and how it gets from farm and sea to plate.

In June 2022, a new four-part series titled &quot;River Cottage Reunited&quot; will premiere on More4.

== Locations of TV shows and other ventures ==

=== The original River Cottage ===

The original River Cottage was a former weekend and holiday home, previously a gamekeeper&#x27;s lodge in the grounds of Slape Manor, Netherbury, Dorset. This was used as the location for series 1-3 of the TV show.

=== River Cottage HQ ===

The original River Cottage HQ (RCHQ) was near Broadoak, Bridport in Dorset and was home to the fourth TV series, &quot;Beyond River Cottage&quot;, which was based around the new project to develop the rural education centre in some old dairy buildings.

The RCHQ ran courses and activities celebrating and teaching the skills and values that Whittingstall learned in his five years as a Dorset smallholder. It focused in particular upon cooking in tune with the seasons, small scale local food production, and adding value to home grown produce for taking to local markets. The courses and events were hosted by different members of the River Cottage team, including some from the television series including Ray Smith (a freelance butcher) and Michael Michaud an organic polytunnel expert. 

In September 2006 River Cottage HQ moved to a new, larger, location.

=== River Cottage HQ (Park Farm) ===
In 2006, the show moved to a new location, also called River Cottage HQ, near the village of Musbury in East Devon. Cradled in the Axe Valley on the Devon/Dorset border, the second River Cottage HQ (known as Park Farm) is a 17th-century farmhouse, converted barns and of land.

River Cottage HQ provides dining experiences in the 18th-century threshing barn; cookery, craft and gardening courses covering a wide variety of topics including bee-keeping, breadmaking, cheese-making, curing meat and foraging; accommodation for guests to stay in the 17th-century farmhouse on a B&amp;B or exclusive use basis following its renovation in early 2019; and hosts a number of private events each year including parties, meetings and weddings.
In early February 2012, River Cottage&#x27;s events barn was largely destroyed by a fire. It has since been rebuilt.

===Other business ventures===

In 2007 the River Cottage team opened the River Cottage local produce store &amp; canteen, a local produce shop and informal restaurant in Trinity Square, Axminster, in a building that formerly housed the town&#x27;s ballroom.
In September 2010 a deli counter was introduced and this venue was renamed the River Cottage Canteen &amp; Deli.

In April 2009, a second Canteen was opened in Bath at a city-centre comedy venue called Komedia.
In 2011 this canteen was sold back to Komedia and although it continued to trade as a canteen it stopped using the River Cottage branding.
Shortly after this, in November 2011, another River Cottage Canteen and Deli was opened in Plymouth, in the historic Royal William Yard.
In March 2013, a third canteen was opened in Bristol and a fourth canteen opened in Winchester in September 2014. 
These three restaurants have now all closed: Plymouth in May 2017,
Bristol in March 2020 and Winchester in July 2020.

Some time between 2014 and 2017 the River Cottage Canteen &amp; Deli name was rebranded to River Cottage Kitchen &amp; Deli.
The Kitchen &amp; Deli in Axminster town centre closed permanently in February 2022 and a new Kitchen &amp; Store was opened near Axminster at Park Farm, the River Cottage HQ, in April 2022.

<text>Gerald Bryan Kieschnick (born January 29, 1943, in Houston, Texas) is the Chief Executive Officer of Legacy Deo (formerly known as the Lutheran Foundation of Texas). Kieschnick served as the 12th president of The Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS), being elected to three terms, in 2001, 2004, and 2007. He was defeated in his bid for a fourth term by the Rev. Matthew C. Harrison on July 13, 2010, at the 64th Regular Convention of the LCMS, and his presidency ended on August 31, 2010.

Kieschnick and his wife, Terry, have two grown children and two grandchildren, all of whom live in Texas.

==Early career==

Kieschnick attended Texas A&amp;M University, graduating with a bachelor of science in 1964. He is a 1970 graduate of Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, Illinois (now located in Fort Wayne, Indiana), obtained his Master of Divinity in 1977 from Concordia in Fort Wayne, and received an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1996 from Concordia University in Austin, Texas.

After his ordination in 1970, Kieschnick served as pastor at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Biloxi, Mississippi, until 1973; at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Beaumont, Texas, from 1973 to 1981; and at Faith Lutheran Church in Georgetown, Texas, from 1981 to 1986.

He served the Texas District of the LCMS as a circuit counselor from 1978 to1981 and as director of public relations from 1977 to 1986. Kieschnick was director of development at Lutheran Foundation of Texas from 1986 to 1988 and then served as its executive director from 1988 to 1991.

In 1991, Kieschnick was elected president of the LCMS&#x27;s Texas District and served in that position until 2001. In addition, from 1998 until his election as LCMS president, Kieschnick chaired the LCMS Commission on Theology and Church Relations and served on the program committee of the LCMS Council of Presidents.

==LCMS presidential election and first term==

At the LCMS&#x27; 2001 convention in St. Louis, Kieschnick was elected to his first three-year term as president of the 2.6-million-member church. He won by 18 votes out of 1,182 total votes cast in the fourth round of balloting over Dean O. Wenthe, then president of Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne, Indiana. Three other candidates had dropped off in the first three ballots. One of those candidates, Daniel Preus, subsequently was elected to be the church body&#x27;s first vice president.

Kieschnick&#x27;s first presidential term was almost immediately beset by controversy (see &quot;Interfaith issues,&quot; below). He faced opposition within the church hierarchy, including from four of the synod&#x27;s five vice-presidents and a majority of the board of directors. Polarization in the LCMS dated back at least to the Seminex controversy in the early 1970s that centered on the faculty of Concordia Seminary, St. Louis. But by the 1990s, members of the LCMS&#x27; more conservative wing (who often dub themselves &quot;confessional Lutherans&quot;) and its more mission-oriented wing had both established internal caucuses, organizations, and news services to promote their viewpoints and to campaign for synod leadership candidates.

===Interfaith issues===
Kieschnick spent much of his first term under fire for his support of Atlantic District president David Benke. On September 23, 2001, Benke took part in an interfaith prayer event at Yankee Stadium sponsored by the city of New York to commemorate the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Daniel Preus and others argued that Benke, by participating alongside non-Lutheran clergy and leaders of non-Christian faiths, had engaged in practices that the synod condemns as &quot;unionism&quot; and &quot;syncretism&quot;, respectively.

Kieschnick and his supporters replied that the event was not a worship service, as Preus maintained, but a civic event, and that Benke had given Christian witness in a permissible manner. In the synod&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Reporter&quot;, which reported on the controversy, Kieschnick said that his support for Benke&#x27;s participation was based on a document titled &quot;The Lutheran Understanding of Church Fellowship&quot;. That document had been prepared by a predecessor LCMS president (Alvin L. Barry) and the synod&#x27;s Commission on Theology and Church Relations, chaired by Kieschnick, and then commended for use and guidance by the synod&#x27;s 2001 convention. In a section under &quot;civic events&quot;, the document states that &quot;offering prayers, speaking, and reading Scripture at events sponsored by governments, schools and volunteer organizations would be a problem if the organization in charge restricted a Christian witness... Without such a restriction, a Lutheran pastor may for valid and good reason participate in civic affairs such as an inauguration, a graduation, or a right-to-life activity. These occasions may provide opportunity to witness to the Gospel. Pastors may have honest differences of opinion about whether or to what extent it is appropriate or helpful to participate in these or similar civic events. In these cases, charity must prevail.&quot; The document continues, &quot;There are also &#x27;once in a lifetime&#x27; situations. It is virtually impossible to anticipate all such situations or to establish rules in advance. Specific answers cannot be given to cover every type of situation pastors and congregations face. These situations can be evaluated only on a case-by-case basis and may evoke different responses from different pastors who may be equally committed to LCMS fellowship principles. The LCMS has always recognized this.&quot;

Two LCMS ministers sought to bring charges against Kieschnick that, if upheld, would have led to his removal from the clergy roster of the synod. The matter ended with the charges against Kieschnick being voided by a ruling of the synod&#x27;s Commission on Constitutional Matters and Benke being cleared of charges that also had been brought against him. For several years, the Benke controversy left some LCMS members speaking of a &quot;crisis in the Synod&quot; and warning openly of the possibilities for a schism.

=== Worldwide mission effort ===
During Kieschnick&#x27;s first term in office, the synod&#x27;s board of directors approved a proposal from the Board for Mission Services for a 15-year initiative to reach 100 million non-Christians worldwide with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Mark Weinrich, senior director for LCMS World Mission Support, said that the plan, subsequently titled &quot;Ablaze!&quot;, was consistent with a mission emphasis for the synod that Kieschnick had promoted. &quot;President Kieschnick set the vision in his acceptance speech because he talked about shaking the earth with the Gospel,&quot; Weinrich said.

The 2004 synod convention took note of the &quot;Ablaze!&quot; initiative by adopting a number of mission-oriented resolutions. Among those was Resolution 1-04 to accept the challenge to reach 100 million people with the Gospel by 2017 (the 500th anniversary of the Reformation) and to seek to raise $100 million over and above the current mission budget for additional mission support by 2010. The fund-raising effort, subsequently titled &quot;Fan Into Flame,&quot; was reported to have raised $58,900,172 as of July 1, 2010 with additional $40 million in major gift requests pending at the time of the 2010 synod convention. 

Only one passing reference to the &quot;Ablaze!&quot; initiative and no references to &quot;Fan Into Flame&quot; appeared in the synod&#x27;s &quot;Convention Proceedings&quot; for its national conventions in 2013, 2016, and 2019 after the election of Matthew Harrison as synod president in 2010. Delegates reaffirmed the synod&#x27;s commitment to its stated mission under the triennial emphasis names of &quot;Witness, Mercy, Life Together&quot; (2013–2019) and &quot;Making Disciples for Life&quot; (since 2019), together with the adoption of specific mission priorities. A final report on the outcomes and costs of the &quot;Fan Into Flame&quot; fundraising campaign was published in the 2013 Convention Workbook distributed to the Synod&#x27;s member congregations and delegates prior to that convention, with a shorter summary final campaign report made available to LCMS member congregations in April of 2012. Campaign participants contributed $55,136,989 with an additional $14,174,732 pledged, of which $5,397,297 had to be written off as uncollectable due to personal economic realities or changes in commitment among donors due to Kieschnick&#x27;s loss in the 2010 election. The campaign ultimately incurred $19,882,793 in related expenses. Among the campaign&#x27;s successes was the rejuvenation of financial support for LCMS missionaries by testing and adopting a network-based direct funding model widely used among non-Lutheran evangelical Christian bodies and groups.

==Reelection and second term==
In 2004, Kieschnick won reelection to the presidency on the first ballot with 653 votes (53 percent of 1,237 votes cast for five nominees). First Vice President Daniel Preus was second among the five nominees with 391 votes (32% of ballots cast). William R. Diekelman, president of the synod&#x27;s Oklahoma District, subsequently defeated Preus on the second ballot for first vice president with 52% of the votes cast.

=== Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synod Structure and Governance ===
On June 10, 2005, Kieschnick sent a memo to selected leaders in the LCMS who had agreed to serve on a newly created panel titled the &quot;Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synodical Structure and Governance&quot; (the word &quot;synodical&quot; in the title was later changed to &quot;synod&quot;), also to be known as the BRTFSSG. Kieschnick wrote to the BRTFSSG members, &quot;I am asking the task force to do a thorough, zero-based assessment of the &quot;entirety&quot; of the system of governance and organizational structure of The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and to make recommendations for improvements in the form of a report to the 2007 Synodical [sic] convention. Your recommended improvements should suggest a form of structure and governance for the decades ahead that is appropriately representative, incorporating sufficient checks and balances of authority without being cumbersome, clumsy, or excessively complex. It should facilitate maximum operating efficiency in behalf of and in support of members of our Synod in accomplishing the mission of our Lord and HIs church.&quot;

In a March 1, 2005, pastoral letter to the synod, Kieschnick had written, &quot;There is a great need for a thorough and fundamental review of what our Synod is, how it is organized, and how it functions. What was first created as an organizational system for a Synod made up of a small number of congregations now struggles to serve more than 6,150 congregations.&quot;

The work of the BRTFSSG extended beyond the 2007 convention, and its final report was not issued until October 2009, about nine months prior to the 2010 convention (see under &quot;Reelection and third term,&quot; below).

==Reelection and third term==
At the 2007 convention of the LCMS, Kieschnick was reelected on the first ballot, receiving 52.3 percent of the total vote.

=== Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synod Structure and Governance (continued) ===
Although the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synod Structure and Governance was to have finished its work in time for the 2007 convention, it did not. Work continued throughout Kieschnick&#x27;s third term.

At the end of 2007, Kieschnick discussed the task force&#x27;s work in &quot;President&#x27;s Leadership News,&quot; distributed as a supplement to the synod&#x27;s &quot;Reporter&quot; newspaper. &quot;The work of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synod Structure and Governance is about improving our ability, in the words of the Synod’s mission statement, &#x27;vigorously to make known the love of Christ by word and deed within our churches, communities, and the world,&#x27;&quot; Kieschnick wrote. He added that its work is about &quot;doing everything humanly possible to ensure for the Synod a viable future so that it can continue to carry out this mission for years to come.&quot;

Two years later, on October 15, 2009, the task force issued its final report in anticipation of the 2010 Synod convention. The report made 21 specific recommendations. One of those recommendations spoke to the structure of the &quot;corporate Synod&quot;. When the report was written, the structure included seven program boards and six commissions, most with staff, that carried out functions outlined in the synod&#x27;s bylaws. The task force said that while the boards and commissions are accountable to the synod convention, they operate independently of each other &quot;to some extent as a series of silos&quot;. The task force wrote that this structure lacks accountability to the needs of congregations, is inefficient and expensive, and creates complications in business oversight and legal compliance. It therefore recommended a new structure that would realign national ministries around two &quot;mission commissions&quot;, one for national mission and one for international mission. Each commission would have a staff that would be responsible to the president of the LCMS through a &quot;chief mission officer&quot; appointed by the president with the concurrence of the synod&#x27;s board of directors.

Kieschnick issued a response to the 21 task force recommendations, which he generally supported. Regarding the recommendation for major change in the structure of the corporate synod, its newspaper reported, &quot;Kieschnick supports the recommendation to eliminate the current boards and commissions, stating it would solve the problems of supervision and accountability within the Synod structure. But he also says that having the chief mission officer accountable to him &#x27;could be seen as concentration of excessive authority in the office of the Synod president. That is neither the task force’s intention nor my desire.&#x27;”

In a pre-convention issue of the &quot;Reporter&quot;, nominees for president responded to a question about their support for the task force&#x27;s recommendations. Kieschnick wrote, &quot;For more than four years task force members have addressed challenges in our Synod—unnecessary bureaucracy, lack of coordination, ambiguous supervisory relationships, inequitable representation, inefficient organization, insufficient accountability, etc. They have sought and responded to feedback from convention delegates and other leaders. While having expressed a few concerns, I believe task force recommendations are critical.&quot; Taking a different view was Rev. Matthew C. Harrison, executive director of LCMS World Relief and Human Care, also nominated for president, who wrote, &quot;Part of me might like the massive increase in power proposed for the Synod President. That’s why it’s &quot;not&quot; a good idea.&quot;

==2010 election==
On July 13, 2010, Kieschnick was defeated for re-election to a fourth term of office by Harrison. The vote was 643 to 527. The same convention adopted many of the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Synod Structure and Governance, including the provision that program staff would be accountable to the Synod&#x27;s member congregations through the synod president, the structure of which included a new &quot;chief mission officer&quot;, rather than separate program boards and appointed executives. Support services personnel would be accountable to the Synod board of directors, not the synod president, through the chief financial officer or chief administrative officer. Those positions would be appointed by the Synod&#x27;s board of directors.

==Post-presidency==
On March 1, 2011, Concordia University Texas announced that it had engaged Kieschnick to fill the newly created position of Presidential Ambassador for Mission Advancement, a position he held through 2015. In January 2016, Kieschnick returned to the Lutheran Foundation of Texas, becoming its CEO on January 1, 2017. In January 2017, the Lutheran Foundation of Texas changed its name to Legacy Deo. It encourages estate planning and charitable giving, with a mission to &quot;inspire giving that impacts life forever&quot;.

<text>&quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; is a 1953 song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Jack Brooks, and became a major hit and signature song for Dean Martin, who first recorded and released it that year. &quot;Amore&quot; () means &quot;love&quot; in Italian.

The song appears in the 1954 film Rear Window, the 1987 film &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, the 1995 film &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot;, the 1999 film &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, and the 2024 film &quot;The Garfield Movie&quot;, as well as the 1997 video game &quot;Mario Teaches Typing 2&quot;.

==History==
The song first appeared in the soundtrack of the Martin and Lewis comedy film &quot;The Caddy&quot;, released by Paramount Pictures on August 10, 1953. Lewis commissioned Warren and Brooks to write songs for Martin to sing in the movie. According to Lewis, he personally paid them $30,000 secretly in the hope that one would be a hit for Martin. In the film the song is performed mainly by Martin, with Lewis joining in and then the other characters in the scene follow. It received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song of that year, but it lost to &quot;Secret Love&quot; from &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; starring Doris Day. In June 1995 the song was performed by the Greek singer Kostas Macedonas and Chorus.

The song remains closely identified with Dean Martin. &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; was used as the title for a 2001 video retrospective of Martin&#x27;s career; and his son, Ricci Martin, titled his 2002 biography &quot;That&#x27;s Amore: A Son Remembers Dean Martin&quot;. As an iconic song, &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; remains a secondary signature song.

Music critic Joe Queenan has described the song as &quot;A charming, if goofy, parody of popular Neapolitan organ-grinder music,&quot; and observed &quot;That&#x27;s Amore was one of many songs from the early Fifties that helped rehabilitate Italy&#x27;s image as a land of magic and romance that had somehow been lured from its festive moorings by the glum fascist Benito Mussolini.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The track that was used for the single released by Capitol Records was recorded on August 13, 1953, (Session 3098; Master 11694-6) at Capitol Records&#x27; studios at 5505 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, California, with the orchestra conducted by Dick Stabile. On November 7, 1953, Martin&#x27;s record of the song, with &quot;You&#x27;re the Right One&quot; (which was recorded at the same session as &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;) on the flip side, peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

<text>Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding (22 November 1787 – 3 March 1855), commonly called Copley Fielding, was an English painter born in Sowerby, near Halifax, and famous for his watercolour landscapes. At an early age Fielding became a pupil of John Varley. In 1810 he became an associate exhibitor in the Old Water-colour Society, in 1813 a full member and in 1831 President of that body (later known as the Royal Society of Watercolours), until his death. He won a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1824 alongside Richard Parkes Bonington and John Constable. He also engaged largely in teaching the art and made ample profits. He later moved to Park Crescent in Worthing and died in the town in March 1855.

Copley Fielding was a painter of much elegance, taste and accomplishment and has always been highly popular with purchasers. He painted a vast number of all sorts of views (occasionally in oil-colour) including marine subjects. Examples of his work is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum and other major museums in Britain. Among the engraved specimens of his art is the &quot;Annual of British Landscape Scenery&quot;, published in 1839.

<doc id="1180251" wikidata="Q60285" url="?curid=1180251" title="Ernst Troeltsch">
<text>Ernst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch (; ; 17 February 1865 – 1 February 1923) was a German liberal Protestant theologian, a writer on the philosophy of religion and the philosophy of history, and a classical liberal politician. He was a member of the history of religions school. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on Albrecht Ritschl, Max Weber&#x27;s conception of sociology, and the Baden school of neo-Kantianism.

==Life==
Troeltsch was born on 17 February 1865 into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area. He then attended university, at the University of Erlangen and then at the University of Göttingen. During his university years, he experienced difficulties in his student fraternity as a result of his homosexuality. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at Göttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the University of Bonn. In 1894, he moved on again to Heidelberg University. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the University of Berlin, where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization. Troeltsch died on 1 February 1923. The famous church historian Adolf von Harnack preached at his funeral.

==Theology==
Throughout Troeltsch&#x27;s life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion and that &quot;the disenchantment of the world&quot; as described by sociologist Max Weber was underway. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, after a paper on the doctrine of &quot;Logos&quot;, Troeltsch responded by saying, &quot;Gentlemen, everything is tottering!&quot; Troeltsch also agreed with Weber&#x27;s Protestant work ethic, restating it in his &quot;Protestantism and Progress&quot;. He viewed the creation of capitalism as having been the result of the specific Protestant sects named by Weber, rather than as a result of Protestantism as a whole. However, his analysis of Protestanitsm was more optimistic than Weber&#x27;s in its focus on religious personal conviction as a source for individualism and spiritual mysticism as a source for subjectivism. Troeltsch interpreted non-Calvinist Protestantism as having had a positive effect on the development of the press, modern education systems, and politics.

His most famous study, &quot;The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches&quot; (1912)&quot;,&quot; is devoted to the vast reception history of Christian social precepts -- as they pertain to culture, economics, and institutions -- in the history of Western Civilization. Troeltsch&#x27;s distinction between churches and sects as social types, for instance, set the course for further theological study.

Troeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era by studying the historical evolution of religion in society. He described European civilization as having three periods: ancient, medieval, and modern. Instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of Protestantism, Troeltsch argued that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. Therefore, the modern period starts later in his account: in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period. Protestantism delayed, rather than heralded, modernity. The reform movement around Luther, Troeltsch argued, was &quot;in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them.&quot;

Troeltsch saw the distinction between early and late (or &quot;neo-&quot;) Protestantism as &quot;the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism.&quot;

== Historiography ==

Troeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical historiography. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for preconceived notions. Troeltsch&#x27;s principles (criticism, analogy, correlation) were used to account for historians&#x27; biases.

=== Principle of criticism ===
Troeltsch&#x27;s claim in the principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. As such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, but he claimed historical situation could be examined as more or less likely to have happened. For Troeltsch, finite and non-revisable historical claims are questionable. 

=== Principle of analogy ===
Historians often think in analogies, which leads them to make anachronistic claims about the past. Troeltsch argued that the probability of analogies cannot usually be validated. He presented human nature as being fairly constant throughout time. 

=== Principle of correlation ===
In regard to historical events, Troeltsch determined that humanity&#x27;s historical life is interdependent upon each individual. Since the cumulative actions of individuals create historical events, there is a causal nature to all events that create an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, affected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation, it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.

==Politics==
Troeltsch was politically a classical liberal and served as a member of the Parliament of the Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1918, he joined the German Democratic Party (DDP). He strongly supported Germany&#x27;s role in World War I: &quot;Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the ethos that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, to your weapons!&quot;

==Reception==
In the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch&#x27;s death, his work neglected as part of a wider rejection of liberal thought with the rise of neo-orthodoxy in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of Karl Barth in the German-speaking world. From 1960 onwards, however, Troeltsch&#x27;s thought has enjoyed a revival. Several books on Troeltsch&#x27;s theological and sociological work have been published since 2000.

<text>The Great Sejm, also known as the Four-Year Sejm (Polish: &quot;Sejm Wielki&quot; or &quot;Sejm Czteroletni&quot;; Lithuanian: &quot;Didysis seimas&quot; or &quot;Ketverių metų seimas&quot;) was a Sejm (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that was held in Warsaw between 1788 and 1792. Its principal aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the Commonwealth politically and economically.

The Sejm&#x27;s great achievement was the adoption of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, often described as Europe&#x27;s first modern written national constitution, and the world&#x27;s second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that &quot;sejm&quot;. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy engineered by some of the country&#x27;s reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.

The reforms instituted by the Great Sejm and the Constitution of 3 May 1791 were undone by the Targowica Confederation and the intervention of the Russian Empire at the invitation of the Targowica Confederates.

== Origins ==

The reforms of the Great Sejm responded to the increasingly perilous situation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, only a century earlier a major European power and indeed the largest state on the continent. By the 18th century the Commonwealth&#x27;s state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional; the government was near collapse, giving rise to the term &quot;Polish anarchy&quot;, and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates. Many historians hold that a major cause of the Commonwealth&#x27;s downfall was the peculiar parliamentary institution of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; (&quot;free veto&quot;), which since 1652 had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state – or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the &quot;Golden Freedoms&quot;). The matters were not helped by the inefficient monarchs elected to the Commonwealth throne around the start of the 18th century, nor by neighboring countries, which were content with the deteriorated state of the Commonwealth&#x27;s affairs and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders.

The Enlightenment European cultural movement had gained great influence in certain Commonwealth circles during the reign of its last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski (1764–95), which roughly coincided with the Enlightenment in Poland. In 1772, the First Partition of Poland, the earliest of the three successive 18th-century partitions of Commonwealth territory that eventually removed Poland from the map of Europe, shocked the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and made it clear to progressive minds that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish. In the last three decades preceding the Great Sejm, there was a rising interest among progressive thinkers in constitutional reform. Even before the First Partition, a Polish noble, Michał Wielhorski, an envoy of the Bar Confederation, had been sent to ask the French &quot;philosophes&quot; Gabriel Bonnot de Mably and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to offer suggestions on a new constitution for a new Poland. Mably had submitted his recommendations (&quot;The Government and Laws of Poland&quot;) in 1770–1771; Rousseau had finished his &quot;Considerations on the Government of Poland&quot; in 1772, when the First Partition was already underway. Notable works advocating the need to reform and presenting specific solutions were published in the Commonwealth itself by Polish-Lithuanian thinkers such as:
* Stanisław Konarski, founder of the Collegium Nobilium (&quot;On the Effective Conduct of Debates in Ordinary Sejms&quot;, 1761–1763);
* Józef Wybicki, composer of the Polish National Anthem (&quot;Political Thoughts on Civil Liberties&quot;, 1775, &quot;Patriotic Letters&quot;, 1778–1778);
* Hugo Kołłątaj, head of the Kołłątaj&#x27;s Forge party (&quot;Anonymous Letters to Stanisław Małachowski&quot;, 1788–1789, &quot;The Political Law of the Polish Nation&quot;, 1790); and
* Stanisław Staszic (&quot;Remarks on the Life of Jan Zamoyski&quot;, 1787).

Also seen as crucial to giving the upcoming reforms their moral and political support were Ignacy Krasicki&#x27;s satires of the Great Sejm era.

== Proceedings ==

===1789–90===

A major opportunity for reform seemed to present itself during the sejm of 1788–92, which opened on 6 October 1788 with 181 deputies, and from 1790 – in the words of the 3 May Constitution&#x27;s preamble – met &quot;in dual number&quot;, when 171 newly elected Sejm deputies joined the earlier-established Sejm. On its second day the Sejm transformed itself into a confederated sejm to make it immune to the threat of the &quot;liberum veto&quot;. Russian tsarina Catherine the Great had issued the approval for the sejm confederation a while ago, at a point she was considering that the successful conclusion of this Sejm may be necessary if Russia would need Polish aid in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. Stanisław Małachowski, a statesman respected both by most factions, was elected as the Marshal of the Sejm.

Many supporters of the reforms were gathered in the Patriotic Party. This group received support from all strata of Polish-Lithuanian society, from societal and political elites, including some aristocratic magnates, through Piarist and Enlightened Catholics, to the radical left. The Party&#x27;s conservative, or right, wing, led by progressive magnates such as Ignacy Potocki, his brother Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, sought alliance with Prussia and advocated opposing King Poniatowski. The Patriotic Party&#x27;s centrists, including Stanisław Małachowski, wished accommodation with the King. The liberal left wing (the Polish Jacobins), led by Hugo Kołłątaj (hence also known as &quot;Kołłątaj&#x27;s Forge&quot;), looked for support to the people of Warsaw. While King Poniatowski also supported some reforms, he was initially not allied with this faction, represented by Potocki, who preferred a republican form of a government.

Events in the world appeared to play into the reformers&#x27; hands. Poland&#x27;s neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki&#x27;s; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.

Overall, the first two years of the Sejm passed with few major reforms, and it was the second half of the Sejm duration that brought major changes.

===1791–92===

The elections of autumn 1790 resulted in a new group of deputies joining those already elected. A second Marshal of the Sejm was elected (Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha). As Małachowski was seen as associated with the reformers, Sapieha was initially seen as a conservative, although he would later switch sides and join the reformers. The doubled number of deputies exceeded the capacity of the parliament chambers, and not all of the deputies could secure a seat; public interest also grew and the entire building and the observation galleries were often overcrowded.

While the Sejm comprised representatives only of the nobility and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers (townspeople), who in the Autumn of 1789 organized a Black Procession, demonstrating their desire to be part of the political process. Taking a cue from similar events in France, and with the fear that if burghers&#x27; demands were not met, their peaceful protests could turn violent, the Sejm on 18 April 1791 adopted a law addressing the status of the cities and the rights of the burghers (the Free Royal Cities Act). Together with the legislation on the voting rights (the Act on Sejmiks of 24 March 1791), it became incorporated into the final constitution.

The new Constitution had been drafted by the king, with contributions from others, including Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj. The king is credited with authoring the general provisions, and Kołłątaj, with giving the work its final shape. Poniatowski aimed for a constitutional monarchy similar to the one in England, with strong central government based upon a strong monarch. Potocki wanted to make the parliament (Sejm) the most powerful of the state&#x27;s institutions, and Kołłątaj, for a &quot;gentle&quot; social revolution, enfranchising other classes in addition to the till-then dominant nobility, but doing so without a violent overthrow of the old order.

Reforms were opposed by conservative elements, including the Hetmans&#x27; Party. The reform&#x27;s advocates, threatened with violence from their opponents, managed to move debate on the new constitution forward by two days from the original 5 May, while many opposed deputies were still away on Easter recess. The ensuing debate and adoption of the Constitution of 3 May took place in a quasi-coup d&#x27;état: recall notices were not sent to known opponents of reform, while many pro-reform deputies arrived early and in secret, and the royal guard were positioned about the Royal Castle, where the Sejm was gathered, to prevent Russian supporters from disrupting the proceedings. On 3 May the Sejm met with only 182 members present, about a half of its &quot;dual&quot; number (or a third, if one was to count all individuals eligible to take part in the proceedings, including the Senate and the king). The bill was read out and adopted overwhelmingly, to the enthusiasm of the crowds gathered outside.

The work of the Great Sejm did not end with the passing of the Constitution. The Sejm continued to debate and pass legislation building on and clarifying that document. Among the most notable acts passed after the 3 May was the &quot;Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych&quot; (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of 5 May 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the &quot;Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów&quot; (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of 22 October 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state, and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Mutual Declaration strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union, while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.

The Sejm was disbanded on 29 May 1792. On that day, soon after learning that the Russian army had invaded Poland, the Sejm gave the commander-in-chief position to the king, and voted to end the session.

== Aftermath ==
Soon afterwards, the Friends of the Constitution, regarded as the first Polish political party, and including many participants of the Great Sejm, was formed to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. The response to the new Constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans&#x27; Party exerted stronger influence. The Great Sejm&#x27;s reforms were brought down by the Targowica Confederation and the intervention of the Russian Empire. On 23 November 1793 the Grodno Sejm annulled all the enactments of the Great Sejm, including the Constitution of 3 May 1791.

<doc id="1180264" wikidata="Q1565773" url="?curid=1180264" title="The Bob Cummings Show">
<text>The Bob Cummings Show (also known in reruns as Love That Bob) is an American sitcom starring Bob Cummings, which was broadcast from January 2, 1955, to September 15, 1959.

The program began with a half-season run on NBC, then ran for two full seasons on CBS, and returned to NBC for its final two seasons. The program was later rerun on ABC daytime and then syndicated under the title &quot;Love That Bob&quot;. A similar (but less successful) follow-up series, &quot;The New Bob Cummings Show&quot;, was broadcast on CBS during the 1961–62 television season.

==Overview==
The series stars Cummings as dashing Hollywood photographer, Air Force reserve officer, and ladies&#x27; man, Bob Collins. The character&#x27;s interest in aviation and photography mirrored Cummings&#x27; own, with his character&#x27;s name the same as the role he played in the 1945 film &quot;You Came Along&quot;. The series also stars Rosemary DeCamp as his sister Margaret MacDonald. In some episodes, Cummings also doubled as Bob and Margaret&#x27;s grandfather, Josh Collins of Joplin, Missouri.

&quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; was important in the development of several careers including series creator, producer, and head writer Paul Henning. Henning, who a decade earlier was a major force in the character development and writing of The Burns and Allen television and radio shows, was a co-producer with George Burns of the Cummings show. He later produced such major 1960s hits as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, and &quot;Green Acres.&quot; Regulars in the show included Ann B. Davis, who twice won Emmy Awards for playing Bob Collins&#x27; assistant Schultzy. Henning apparently remembered cast members Nancy Kulp and Joi Lansing favorably, giving both of them roles several years later on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Kulp as Miss Hathaway (secretary to banker Milburn Drysdale — a character similar to Pamela Livingstone, the one she played on Cummings&#x27; show) – and Lansing as Gladys Flatt, wife of Lester Flatt. A decade after &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; left the air, Davis went on to play the housekeeper Alice in &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. In the 1995 film &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, which featured another actress playing Alice, Davis reprised the role of Schultzy for a cameo that suggests the character went on to become a truck driver.

Olive Sturgess appeared in 12 episodes as Carol Henning, girlfriend to Bob&#x27;s nephew, Chuck. Versatile character actress Kathleen Freeman appeared in six episodes as Bertha Krause. Perhaps the biggest career boost was received by young Dwayne Hickman, a student at Loyola University in Los Angeles, who appeared as the nephew and became a favorite with young female viewers. During the last season of &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, he was cast as the lead in CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

This program represented the height of Cummings&#x27; television career. Although he later starred in two other early-&#x27;60s series, &quot;The New Bob Cummings Show&quot; and &quot;My Living Doll&quot;, and made guest appearances on several other TV series, he never again achieved that level of success on television.

==Production==
Cummings had earlier starred in the 1952 sitcom &quot;My Hero&quot;, which ran one season. Taft Schreiber of MCA brought George Burns and Paul Henning to Cummings and pitched him the idea for &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;. They formed a company, Laurel, to make the show. Rod Amateau wrote many episodes. Henning drew extensively on Cummings&#x27; real-life past in creating the show.

The show was sold in August 1954, but Cummings did not agree to go on air until January &quot;when we had a comfortable backlog of scripts.&quot; He did this due to his experience on &quot;My Hero&quot;, where he felt the show went to air without a sufficient supply of scripts.

&quot;I also resolved we wouldn&#x27;t aim at the kid audience&quot;, he added. &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s easy to develop a following that way, but kids are the most fickle audience in the world. Once they drop you, you&#x27;re finished forever. So we aimed at the adults, but strangely enough, we started to develop a strong kid following anyway.&quot;

The role of Schultzy was created for Jane Withers. However, she had too many demands, which the producers were not willing to meet. Eddie Rubin suggested Ann B. Davis, who was cast.

The show started in January 1955 on NBC at Sunday 10:30 pm. In June, the series was shifted from NBC to CBS on Thursdays at 8 pm by its sponsor RJ Reyolds Tobacco to get more access to markets. In April 1957, the show moved back to NBC on Tuesday nights at 9:30 pm.

Dwayne Hickman became a break-out star on the show. The series had various recurring models who were given opportunities to act, including Suzanne Alexander, Sally Todd, Norma Brooks, and Joi Lansing.

Rod Amateau, who worked on the show, said the reason it was successful was:
He [Cummings&#x27; character] was unsuccessful. He would never score with these girls because his nephew, his sister, or Schultzy would show up. He had dreams and illusions of being a playboy, but he wasn&#x27;t making it. His frustration is what made the show funny.In December 1958, Davis signed to make two more years of the show. The same month, Hickman left for his own show &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, although he had filmed enough episodes so that he appeared regularly on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; straight through to the series&#x27; conclusion.

In anticipation of Hickman&#x27;s departure, a new character was introduced midway through the final season: a six-year-old waif named Tammy Johnson played by Tammy Marihugh. This character was seen in eight episodes, and presumably would have continued on as a precocious foil for the Bob Collins character had the series continued into season 6.

In January 1959, the show celebrated its fifth year. Henning put part of the reason for its success down to the fact that it was a tight operation – Henning wrote most episodes, Cummings directed, and Cummings&#x27; wife handled business.

During the making of the show, Cummings became increasingly under the grip of his addiction to methamphetamine, although this was kept from the public.

===End of series===
The series ended in 1959. Cummings said it was his decision, claiming he needed a break. He also said he had financial considerations, as he wanted to sell the show into syndication and wanted to do that before the show became too dated. He also claimed if he kept making it, he would be hit with a tax bill.

==Syndication==
Reruns under the title &quot;Love That Bob&quot; appeared on ABC&#x27;s daytime lineup from October 12, 1959, to December 1, 1961. Repeats were popular through the 1960s on local stations before reappearing on the CBN Cable Network in the mid-1980s. The series remains in syndication on some smaller stations today. The original opening credits for the series incorporated a commercial for Dunhill cigarettes and were replaced with the &quot;Love That Bob&quot; opening.

==Home media==
Twenty episodes have lapsed into the public domain, and all were released by DigiView Productions in 2004, Critics&#x27; Choice Video in 2004–5, Platinum Disc, LLC in 2005, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment in 2005, and Alpha Home Entertainment in 2006, among others. Also, on March 20, 2012, MPI Home Video released a Region 1 DVD collection of episodes from Cummings&#x27; mid-1960s series &quot;My Living Doll&quot;, and a standalone episode of &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; was included as a bonus feature.

==Awards==
In 1956, Cummings was nominated for an Emmy for Best Actor in a Continuous Role and Ann B. Davis for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The show was also nominated for Best Comedy. In 1958, the show was nominated for an Emmy for Best Comedy. Davis won for Best Supporting Actress. In 1959, the show, Cummings and Davis were nominated for Emmys.

==Influence==
Ann B. Davis&#x27;s character, Schultzy, was the inspiration for the comic-book character Pepper Potts, a supporting character in the &quot;Iron Man&quot; comics. Potts first appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #45 (September 1963), and was depicted with brown hair in a style resembling Schultzy&#x27;s. Eventually, the editorial team decided that the resemblance was too great, and in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #50, her appearance was altered to give her red hair and a different style.

<text>Padda is a genus of estrildid finches restricted to islands in southern Indonesia.

These are small, plump, gregarious passerine birds. They frequent open grassland and cultivation and feed mainly on grain and other seeds, including rice.

Both species have white-cheeked black heads and thick bills. The sexes are similar, but immature birds have brown upperparts and paler brown underparts and cheeks. The call of both species is a &quot;chip&quot;, and the song is a raid series of call notes &quot;chipchipchipchipchipchip&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Padda&quot; was introduced in 1850 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach for the Java sparrow. The word &quot;Padda&quot; was used as an English name for the Java sparrow by George Edwards in 1743 and may come from the Malay word &quot;padi&quot; meaning &quot;rice&quot;.

===Species===
The species are:



Java sparrow is a popular cagebird, and has been introduced in a large number of other countries. Both &quot;Padda&quot; species are threatened by trapping for the cage bird trade.
Many taxonomists now place this genus in &quot;Lonchura&quot; with the mannikins and munias.

<text>West Kyo (also known locally as Old Kyo) is a small village in County Durham, England, United Kingdom. The name &#x27;kyo&#x27; is derived from an old word for &#x27;cow&#x27;. It is situated a very short distance to the north of Annfield Plain and to the east of Catchgate. Close by are New Kyo, 15 minutes walk to the south at the other side of local land mark &quot;The Bogs&quot;, the C2C and &quot;Kyo Pond&quot;. East Kyo is 15 minutes walk to the east. Harperley is 15 minutes walk to the north. The nearest large town is Stanley. The skyline is dominated by the Pontop Pike Television Transmitter to the northwest.

==Ye Olde Earl Grey Inn==
The main landmark of the village is the 200 year old &quot;Ye Olde Earl Grey Inn&quot; public house, with an internal decor of wooden beams and whitewash walls (though much has been removed due to renovation). This pub is reputed to be haunted by a ghost called &quot;The Grey Lady&quot;, a former landlady who died in the 19th century. Another former landlord also placed five and ten pence pieces in gaps within the wooden beams during the 1990s, some of which are still being found to this day. The pub is known locally for Sunday lunches, karaoke and other intermittent entertainment on Saturdays, though since the COVID-19 pandemic the Thursday night quiz is no longer run. 

Elton John is rumoured to have visited the Earl Grey for a meal back in 1978, though this is unconfirmed as is the alleged presence of his signature on the wall behind the southern end of the bar. Also, a copy (not an original) of a Banksy artwork was installed in the men&#x27;s toilets in 2014 by a previous landlady. The current gull-obsessed landlord is known for his robust banter and sarcasm.

==History==
The village developed during former periods of heavy coal mining in the area during the 19th century and a gas works used to be situated on its northern edge. A period of substantial decline followed during the 20th century, during which the village lost a school, a local shop and a second public house called &quot;The Rose Cottage&quot;, which had an &#x27;ale only&#x27; licence (otherwise known as a &quot;jerry&quot; - now converted to a private house). New developments starting in the late 1980s onwards have, however, seen a recent expansion in the village in terms of size and population.

==Famous people==
West Kyo was the birthplace of John Buddle (1773), the famous colliery viewer and mining engineer, who later went on to work with Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry in the development of Seaham Harbour.

Kyo Village was the birthplace of Hugh Simpson Rodham (on 16th Aug 1879), Hillary Clinton&#x27;s grandfather who emigrated to the United States.

<doc id="1180297" wikidata="Q3210329" url="?curid=1180297" title="La Maison Simons">
<text>La Maison Simons (colloquially Simons) is a Canadian department store chain founded in 1840 by Richard and Peter Simons. The business was established by the son of a Scottish immigrant to Quebec as a dry goods store. In the 1960s, the focus of the business changed to a department store, incorporating youth-oriented brands. Beginning in 1981, La Maison Simons began an expansion across Quebec. In 2012, the company expanded its business to the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta first, before opening several more stores across Canada. The success of the location at the West Edmonton Mall led to the company being sought out as a key anchor tenant at malls across Canada. Primarily a privately held firm, La Maison Simons received outside investment for the first time in its history in 2018 when it sought to open a distribution centre in Quebec City.

==History==

Peter Simons, born in Scotland in 1785, arrived in Lower Canada in 1812, settling on a small farm near Quebec City in Beauport. Peter Simons raised a family of five, including a son, John Simons, who went on to open a small dry goods shop in Quebec City in 1840 at the age of 17. Placing an emphasis on quality merchandise, he made more than 70 crossings of the Atlantic Ocean in order to seek out quality English and Scottish goods to stock as merchandise.

In 1870, John Simons moved his shop to 20 Côte de la Fabrique, where it remains today. Business increased following the move, and in 1952 the post-World War II boom brought new market opportunities. This is when entered the company and led the store into a new era, transforming it into a department store where it became leader in popular fashion with the introduction of youth-centred and fashion forward brands such as Twik, which was based on Twiggy, a cultural icon of the time.

===Expansion===
1961 marked a turning point for La Maison Simons as it entered a growth phase with its new store in Place Sainte-Foy where home decor was introduced as well as new brands for men and women in their thirties and forties. In 1981, a new store opened in Galeries de la Capitale, also in Quebec City. La Maison Simons opened new locations in Sherbrooke and Montreal, Quebec in 1999. Two years later in 2001, a store was opened at Promenades Saint-Bruno. The final new location in the burst of expansion was in 2002, when La Maison Simons opened a new store in Laval, Quebec.

In 2012, Simons expanded to its seventh and largest location at West Edmonton Mall, its first outside of Quebec. It spent nearly $50 million on the store alone. The success of the location led other shopping malls to seek out La Maison Simons as an anchor tenant. On March 27, 2013, Simons announced it would open a new location in Ottawa, Ontario&#x27;s Rideau Centre in 2015 (although the store did not actually open until August 2016). This was followed by an announcement on December 6, 2013, stating that a flagship store was to open at Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, in spring 2016. The new store, which opened in March 2016, occupies a large portion of the former Sears Canada store.

A new store in Gatineau, Quebec, opened on August 13, 2015, investing $21 million in the location. Furthermore, in 2015, a location opened at Park Royal Shopping Centre in West Vancouver, British Columbia. A store in Calgary, Alberta, opened on March 16, 2017, in the Lancaster Building as part of The Core shopping mall. In August 2017, La Maison Simons opened a new store in Edmonton, Alberta, at Londonderry Mall. In May 2018, La Maison Simons received outside investment for the first time in its history as part of efforts to open a new distribution centre in Quebec City. New stores are expected to open in the Toronto Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Shopping Centre, in the space occupied by Nordstrom, in 2025.

==Cultural==

Celebrating the 400th anniversary of Quebec City in 2008, La Maison Simons gifted a restored fountain, the , imported from France. The fountain was originally positioned in Bordeaux&#x27;s Allées de Tourny, named after Aubert Tourny, a French intendant remembered for his contribution to the beautification of Bordeaux, Quebec City&#x27;s sister city. It was built in the mid-19th century and won a gold medal at the Paris world exposition of 1855. The Fontaine de Tourny was installed in front of the National Assembly of Quebec in April 2007.

In August 2008, the retailer chose to withdraw its fall catalogue after complaints its models were too thin.

Simons store locations are each uniquely designed. The current CEO, Peter Simons, said in an interview with &quot;Canadian Business&quot; &quot;We’re trying to hold on to this belief in creativity and architecture and art. We’re working with Doug Coupland, for instance, on an art piece in Vancouver, and we try to do that with all the stores we build.&quot; All stores incorporate art installations and unique architectural elements.

== Company struggles ==
In February 2020, Canada Goose ended its wholesale agreement with La Maison Simons, which accounted for millions in sales for the company. At the same time and through the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Simons was having troubles with credit insurance on deliveries and all stock from designers, such as Balmain, had been moved to Simons&#x27; website. In August 2020, La Maison Simons claims to have regained profitability and sent letters to vendors in July assuring payment in full and fall deliveries will be delayed to preserve cash.

<text>Cindy Walker (July 20, 1917 – March 23, 2006) was an American songwriter, as well as a country music singer and dancer. She wrote many popular and enduring songs recorded by many artists.

She adopted a craftsman-like approach to her songwriting, often tailoring particular songs to specific artists. She produced a large body of songs that have been described as “direct, honest and unpretentious”. She had Top 10 hits spread over five decades.

She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in March 2011.

==Early life==
Cindy Walker was born on July 20, 1917, on her grandparents&#x27; farm near Mart, Texas (near Mexia, east of Waco), the daughter of a cotton-broker. Her maternal grandfather F.L. Eiland was a noted composer of hymns and her mother was a fine pianist. From childhood Cindy Walker was fond of poetry and wrote habitually.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
As a teenager, inspired by newspaper accounts of the dust storms on the American prairies in the mid-1930s, Walker wrote the song, &quot;Dusty Skies&quot; (later recorded by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys). In 1936, her &quot;Casa de Mañana&quot; was performed by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra (as part of the Texas Centennial celebrations). By the end of the decade Cindy Walker was singing and dancing in Texas stage shows.

===Move to Los Angeles===
In 1940, Walker, at the age of 22, accompanied her parents on a business trip to Los Angeles. As they were driving down Sunset Boulevard she asked her father to stop the car near the Bing Crosby Enterprises building. Walker later recalled: &quot;I had decided that if I ever got to Hollywood, I was going to try to show Bing Crosby a song I had written for him called &#x27;Lone Star Trail&#x27;&quot;. Her father said &quot;You&#x27;re crazy, girl&quot;, but nonetheless stopped the car. Walker went inside the building to pitch her song and emerged shortly afterward to ask her mother to play the piano for her. Bing Crosby&#x27;s brother Larry Crosby had agreed to listen to the song; Walker sang “Lone Star Trail” to him, accompanied by her mother. Larry Crosby was impressed and aware that his brother was looking for a new Western song to record. The next day Cindy played guitar and sang “Lone Star Trail” for Bing Crosby at Paramount Studios (where he was making a movie). Crosby arranged for her to record a demo with Dave Kapp of Decca Records, who was also impressed and offered her a recording contract. &quot;Lone Star Trail&quot; was recorded and became a top-ten hit for Bing Crosby.

===Performances and recordings===
Walker remained in Los Angeles for 13 years. In 1940 she appeared as a singer in the Gene Autry Western &quot;Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride&quot;. The Decca recording contract led to Walker recording several songs with Texas Jim Lewis and His Lone Star Cowboys, including “Seven Beers with the Wrong Man” in 1941, which was also filmed as an early &quot;Soundie&quot; (a precursor of music videos). In 1944 Walker recorded a song (not her own) which became a top ten hit, “When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again”.

===Focus on songwriting===
Walker successfully pitched her songs to Bob Wills and began to regularly contribute compositions for recordings and the movies that Wills made in the 1940s. The collaboration was extremely fruitful: Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys eventually recorded over 50 of Cindy Walker&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Cherokee Maiden&quot; (1941), &quot;Dusty Skies&quot; (1941), &quot;Miss Molly&quot; (1942), &quot;Sugar Moon&quot; (co-written with Bob Wills; 1947) and &quot;Bubbles in My Beer&quot; (1948). Bob Wills and his band performed Walker&#x27;s first top-ten country hit, “You&#x27;re From Texas” (1944).

Among her other 1940s hits were &quot;Triflin&#x27; Gal&quot; (top-10 records for both Al Dexter and Walter Shrum, 1945); &quot;Warm Red Wine&quot; (Ernest Tubb, 1949), and &quot;Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me&quot; (Eddy Arnold, 1950). Some sources have erroneously attributed Johnny Bond&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Oklahoma Waltz&quot; to her; probably confusing it with her own 1947 composition of that name, co-written with and recorded by Spade Cooley.

During the 1950s, Walker continued her success as a writer of popular songs. In 1952 Hank Snow had a hit with her &quot;The Gold Rush Is Over&quot; and in 1955 Webb Pierce had success with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;.

Another Walker song was &quot;Blue Canadian Rockies&quot; recorded by Gene Autry (which featured in Autry&#x27;s 1952 movie of the same name). The song was revived in 1968 by The Byrds on their influential country-rock album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;. In 1955 Eddy Arnold pitched Walker the theme and the song-title for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; when they met during a WSM deejay convention in Nashville. Walker then wrote the song based on Arnold&#x27;s idea, with both receiving songwriting credit for their contributions. It has been described as “a beautifully symmetrical and poignant portrait of a love not to be”.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; has been recorded by numerous artists over the years, most successfully by Jerry Vale (1956); Lenny Welch (1960); Ray Charles (1962); and Elvis Presley (1967). &quot;Anna Marie&quot;, was a hit for Jim Reeves in 1957 and the beginning of another productive artist-writer association which culminated in &quot;This is It&quot; (1965) and &quot;Distant Drums&quot; (a posthumous hit for Reeves). &quot;Distant Drums&quot; remained at No.1 on the British charts for five weeks in 1966.

Reeves recorded many of Walker&#x27;s compositions; she often wrote specifically for him and offered him the right of first refusal of her tracks. &quot;Distant Drums&quot; was originally recorded by Reeves as a demo, simply because he loved the song. Chet Atkins felt the time was not right for an international release. This demo, like many for Reeves, was unearthed upon his death and along with Atkins and Mary Reeves, Walker oversaw the production of the overdub which was to be released in 1966, and became a huge international hit. 

In 1961 Eddy Arnold had a minor hit with Walker&#x27;s &quot;Jim, I Wore a Tie Today&quot;, a moving song about the death of a cowboy. Walker also wrote the song &quot;Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream) &quot;, which was recorded by Roy Orbison (who also recorded a version of &quot;Distant Drums&quot;). She originally had little confidence in “Dream Baby”, but Orbison&#x27;s recording was a hit in both the US and Britain in 1962, and was a hit again in 1971 for Glen Campbell and in 1983 for Lacy J. Dalton. In 1964 Fred Foster of Monument Records &quot;tempted her back into the studio to record an album, &quot;Words and Music by Cindy Walker&quot;. Walker&#x27;s song &quot;In the Misty Moonlight&quot; was a hit for both Jerry Wallace (1964) and Dean Martin (1967) as well as being recorded by Jim Reeves. &quot;Heaven Says Hello&quot; (recorded by Sonny James) and &quot;You Are My Treasure&quot; (Jack Greene) were hits in 1968, both written by Walker.

==Honors, awards and tributes==
In 1970 Walker became a charter member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1981 Mickey Gilley&#x27;s version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; was a hit in the country charts. A year later Walker had her last major hit with Ricky Skaggs’ reworking of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;.

It has been estimated that more than 500 of Walker’s songs have been recorded and that her songs made the Top 40 charts (country or pop) more than 400 times. In September 1997 Walker was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (together another songwriter, Harlan Howard). During her acceptance speech, Walker recited some verse she had written for the occasion:In the 1980s, my mother bought me a dress for a BMI affair and she said “when they put you in the Hall of Fame, that&#x27;s the dress I want you to wear.” And I said “Oh Mama, the Hall of Fame? Why that will never be.” And the years went by, but my mother&#x27;s words remained in my memory. And I know tonight she&#x27;d be happy, though she&#x27;s gone now to her rest. But I think of all that she did for me, and tonight I&#x27;m wearing this dress.
Her speech was followed by a standing ovation and Walker left the stage in tears after softly blowing a kiss. During the proceedings renowned songwriter (and fellow Hall of Fame inductee) Harlan Howard described Walker as &quot;the greatest living songwriter of country music&quot;.

In 1998, Walker was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2002 the Country Music Television network honored the &quot;40 Greatest Women in Country Music&quot;. The women were selected for their contribution to the genre by a survey of hundreds of American artists and music historians and Walker was ranked No. 32.

In March 2006, Willie Nelson released &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker&quot;, an album featuring 13 of Walker&#x27;s well-known songs.

==Personal life==
In her personal life, Walker shunned the limelight. It was often reported that she never married, though in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; shortly before her death, Walker stated she once had “a very short-lived marriage”. After her stint in Los Angeles she returned to Texas in 1954, living in Mexia in a modest three-bedroom house with her widowed mother, Oree.

Walker&#x27;s custom was rising at dawn each day to write songs. She typed her lyrics on a pink-trimmed manual typewriter and Oree helped work out melodies for her daughter&#x27;s words. Each year Walker and her mother would operate from an apartment in Nashville for five months or so in order to market the songs. Oree Walker died in 1991. In a 2004 interview Walker stated: &quot;I miss Mama every day&quot;.

===Death===
Walker died near her home, at the Parkview Regional Hospital in Mexia, Texas, on March 23, 2006, at age 88. She died seven days after Willie Nelson&#x27;s tribute album to her was released. She had been ill for several weeks prior to her death. She was buried in the Mexia City Cemetery. Her family had a custom-designed sculpture created for her gravestone to honor the songwriter and her work. The memorial sculpture is a large pink-granite guitar (in her signature color).

<text>Escape to River Cottage is the first River Cottage television series in which celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall takes over a Dorset cottage and sets out to achieve a form of rural self-sufficiency.

==Show summary==

Along the way, Fearnley-Whittingstall encounters many challenges largely caused by the weather and pests. Every week, Fearnley-Whittingstall meets up with different members of the Dorset community and gets a different kind of livestock (e.g., fish, pork) from each of them, usually free or bartered. Local organic vegetable guru Michael Michaud, homecraft expert Barbara and experienced vegetable competitor Roy Gunning all make appearances as the series provides insight into country life.

<text>Rear-Admiral Charles Davis Lucas (19 February 1834 – 7 August 1914) was a Royal Navy officer whose gallantry in 1854 was the earliest action that led to the award of the Victoria Cross, the highest British award, which is for gallantry in the face of the enemy. He reached the rank of rear admiral during his time in the navy.

==Details==
Lucas was born in Druminargal House, County Armagh, on 19 February 1834. He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1848 at age 13, served aboard , and saw action in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852–53 aboard the frigate &quot;Fox&quot; at Rangoon, Pegu, and Dalla. By age 20, he had become a mate. For his gallantry during the Battle of Bomarsund of the Crimean War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for the following deed:

On 21 June 1854 in the Baltic, , with two other ships, was bombarding Bomarsund, a fort in Åland off Finland. The fire was returned from the fort, and at the height of the action a live shell landed on &quot;Hecla&quot; upper deck, with its fuse still hissing. All hands were ordered to fling themselves flat on the deck, but Lucas with great presence of mind ran forward and hurled the shell into the sea, where it exploded with a tremendous roar before it hit the water. Thanks to Lucas&#x27;s action no one on board was killed or seriously wounded by the shell, and accordingly he was immediately promoted to lieutenant by his commanding officer.

Lucas was personally presented with the Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria at the first VC investiture held at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857.

==Later life==
His act of bravery in &quot;Hecla&quot; was the first to be rewarded with the Victoria Cross. His later career included service on , , , , and . He was promoted to commander in 1862 and commanded the experimental armoured gunboat in 1867. He was promoted to captain in 1867, before retiring on 1 October 1873. He was later promoted to rear-admiral on the retired list in 1885. During his career he received the India General Service Medal with the bar Pegu 1852, the Baltic Medal 1854–55, and the Royal Humane Society Lifesaving Medal.

In 1879 he married Frances Russell Hall, daughter of Admiral William Hutcheon Hall, who had been captain of &quot;Hecla&quot; in 1854. The couple had three daughters together. Lucas served for a time as Justice of the Peace for both Kent and Argyllshire, and died in Great Culverden, Kent on 7 August 1914. He is buried at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church Mereworth, Maidstone, Kent.

==Medals==
Lucas&#x27;s campaign medals, including his Victoria Cross, are displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. They are not the original medals, which were left on a train and never recovered. Replacement copies were made, though the reverse of the Victoria Cross copy is uninscribed.

<doc id="1180324" wikidata="Q944912" url="?curid=1180324" title="Sony Ericsson K700">
<text>The Sony Ericsson K700 was introduced in 2004 as a high-end mobile phone, and as a successor to the T630. It was succeeded by the K750.

==Features==
The K700 features Bluetooth, IrDA, GPRS (4+2), Java ME support, and a 640x480 (VGA resolution) digital camera which is capable of taking still photographs and videos. The digital camera has 4× digital zoom and an LED light which is bright enough to use as both a flash for the camera and a torch. The digital camera can extrapolate photographs to higher resolutions - up to 1280x960 in extended mode, about 1.2-megapixel resolution, however, due to poor VGA quality, pictures often appear to be pixelated when uploaded onto a PC. The K700 also has a built-in email client, WAP and HTML browser which supports the SVG presentation Tiny specification, a media player which is capable of playing MIDI, WAV, MP3 and AAC audio files and 3GP, MPEG-4 video files, and an FM radio (which is only operable when the supplied headphones are inserted).

Its Java ME implementation supports Mobile 3D Graphics API. It is advertised as having 41 megabytes of built-in memory, which is not expandable.

One unusual feature of the device was its support of the HID Bluetooth profile, under the name of &quot;Remote Control&quot;. This is the first instance of HID profile support in a mainstream device. This poorly documented feature allows the device to function as a computer keyboard/mouse. This feature has been included in most subsequent Sony Ericsson models, such as the Sony Ericsson S700 and K750.

==Variants==
* K700i (&#x27;i&#x27; for International&#x27;): GSM 900/1800/1900 for all regions except China.
* K700c (&#x27;c&#x27; for China): GSM 900/1800/1900 for China, featuring Chinese keypad and Chinese language interface.

==Design==
The K700 weighs 93g (3.3 oz). It is a rectangular unit that is typically held in the palm of the hand, with the buttons operated by the thumb. It has the &#x27;dual-front&#x27; design common to most Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T630, with the back of the mobile phone designed to look like a digital camera. The central joystick button is used for selecting options and navigating menus (as this is essential for phone operation it wears quickly and jams under heavy use), with the &quot;C&quot; button as an &#x27;undo&#x27; or &#x27;delete&#x27; button, and the arrow-labeled button as a &#x27;return&#x27; or &#x27;back&#x27; button. The two buttons labeled by black horizontal lines, known as &#x27;hotkeys&#x27; or &#x27;soft keys&#x27; perform the function of making binary decisions, labelled on the phone&#x27;s display (e.g.: save/discard). The on/off button is a black button that is located on the top of the phone next to the IrDA port.

There are three sidekeys on the left of the phone; two control volume (for both calls and when playing sound files) - these also control brightness when in camera mode; and when held down can skip between tracks whilst using the minimized media player. The third sidekey activates the digital camera mode, and also acts as a shutter button when in camera mode.
A sidekey on the right of the phone starts the web browser and goes to the home page as set in the Internet profile settings. There is a sticker on this side, labeled &quot;Online&quot; on non-network specific handsets. Additionally, the rubber pad at the very base of the front of the phone (below the main keypad and labeled &quot;Quickshare&quot; in non-network specific versions) is prone to becoming detached.

The bottom end of this phone features the second generation of connectors, dating back from the Ericsson T28, and aptly dubbed the &quot;T28&quot; port. They are covered by a rubber clip, which is also prone to becoming horribly loose and, in some circumstances, falling off. This is Sony Ericsson&#x27;s last phone to use the T28 connector (later models, as of the K750, use the Sony-designed FastPort connector).

<text>&quot;Canonicus&quot; (ACM-12) was a &quot;Camanche&quot;-class auxiliary minelayer in the United States Navy. It was named for Canonicus, a chief of the Narragansett Indians.

&quot;Canonicus&quot; was originally delivered to the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps, Mine Planter Service in 1942 by Marietta Manufacturing Company of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The ship was named USAMP Major General Erasmus Weaver for Erasmus M. Weaver, Jr., the first chief of the National Guard Bureau.

After serving in the Mine Planter Service of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps, it was transferred to the Navy in 1944, classified ACM-12. &quot;ACM-12&quot; was reclassified MMA-12, 7 February 1955 and assigned the name &quot;Canonicus&quot; on 1 May 1955. &quot;Canonicus&quot; was never commissioned and thus never bore the &quot;United States Ship&quot; (USS) prefix showing status as a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy.

After being in reserve with the Navy the ship became a yacht, was converted to diesel, and became the Sandy Hook pilot boat &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

<doc id="1180345" wikidata="Q911889" url="?curid=1180345" title="Targowica Confederation">
<text>The Targowica Confederation (, , ) was a confederation established by Polish and Lithuanian magnates on 27 April 1792, in Saint Petersburg, with the backing of the Russian Empress Catherine II. The confederation opposed the Constitution of 3 May 1791 and fought in the Polish–Russian War of 1792, which led to the Second and Third Partitions of Poland.

==History==
The Targowica confederation opposed the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which had been adopted by the Great Sejm, especially the provisions limiting the privileges of the nobility. The text of the founding act of the confederation was drafted by the Russian general Vasili Stepanovich Popov, Chief of Staff of Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Its purpose was proclaimed in the small town of Targowica and the Potocki&#x27;s estate (now in Holovanivsk Raion in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine) on May 14, 1792. Four days later two Russian armies invaded the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth without a formal declaration of war.

The forces of the Targowica Confederation defeated the troops loyal to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Sejm and King Stanisław August Poniatowski in the Polish–Russian War of 1792. As a result, the King, Poniatowski, formally joined the Confederation. Their victory precipitated the Second Partition of Poland and set the stage for the Third Partition and the final dissolution of the Commonwealth in 1795. This outcome came as a surprise to most of the Confederates, who had wished only to restore the status quo ante and had expected that the overthrow of the May 3rd Constitution would achieve that end.

==Legacy==
The term &quot;targowiczanin&quot;, which historically applies to each member and supporter of the Targowica Confederation, became a synonym for a traitor, just as &quot;Targowica&quot; is synonymous with treason. These meanings still function in the Polish language up to the present day.

== Leading members ==

* Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki: Marshal (head) of the Confederation. Sentenced to death, but never apprehended. Instead, on September 29, 1794, his portrait was hanged (see illustration). In 1795 he was rewarded by Catherine the Great with the Russian Order of Alexander Nevsky and the rank of &quot;Général en chef&quot;.

Other magnate members:
* Józef Ankwicz convicted of treason and sentenced to hanging on 9 May 1794.
* ambassador Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski hanged June 28, 1794. 
* Franciszek Ksawery Branicki: Sentenced to death during the Kościuszko Uprising, but never apprehended. Having emigrated to Russia, he died at Belaya Tserkov, 1819.
* Szymon Marcin Kossakowski: Hanged in Vilnius on April 25, 1794, during the Kościuszko Uprising.
* Józef Kazimierz Kossakowski: Bishop. Hanged May 9, 1794, in Warsaw during the Kościuszko Uprising.
* Ignacy Jakub Massalski: Bishop. Hanged June 28, 1794, in Warsaw during the Kościuszko Uprising.
* hetman Piotr Ożarowski convicted of treason and sentenced to hanging on 9 May 1794.
* Seweryn Rzewuski Sentenced in absentia by the Supreme Criminal Court to death and the confiscation of his estates. Executed in effigy on 29 September 1794.
* Józef Zabiełło convicted of treason and sentenced to hanging on 9 May 1794.

* Hetman Party

== Quotes ==

* From the Establishing Act of the Targowica Confederation:

&quot;The desires of Her Highness Empress of Russia [Catherine the Great], ally of Rzeczpospolita [the Commonwealth], are and were no other than by using her armies to return to Rzeczpospolita and Poles the freedoms, and especially security and happiness to all citizens&quot;
* One of the founders of the Targowica Confederation, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki: 

&quot;Each true Pole, not blinded by the Prussian and royalist cabal, is convinced, that our Fatherland can only be saved by Russia, otherwise our nation will be enslaved&quot;.
* After Stanisław Poniatowski&#x27;s abdication and the destruction of the Commonwealth, Szczęsny Potocki said: 

&quot;About past Poland and Poles [I don&#x27;t want to talk anymore]. Gone is this country, and this name, as many others have perished in the world&#x27;s history. I am now a Russian forever.&quot;

<text>Craig Quinnell (born 9 July 1975) is a Welsh former rugby union player.

Quinnell began his senior career with Llanelli and after that joined Richmond for two years. He played 54 games for Cardiff RFC between 1999 and 2002, after which he left to join English club Saracens and, for a short while, Worcester but was among the earliest recruits to the newly established Cardiff Blues, playing for three seasons until his injury-enforced retirement.

Quinnell won his first international cap in 1995, playing as a flanker against Fiji. He earned a total of 32 international caps, the majority in the second row. He was a member of Wales&#x27; World Cup squad in 1999 and toured with Wales to Argentina, also in 1999, and Japan two years later.

On 13 April 2006, Quinnell announced his retirement from professional rugby. This came following a neck injury sustained during a game for the Cardiff Blues against Glasgow Warriors. Doctors told him that he risked being in a wheelchair if he played rugby again.

Craig Quinnell is the son of former Welsh international Derek Quinnell and the younger brother of Scott Quinnell. The youngest Quinnell brother, Gavin, played professionally for the Scarlets.

<doc id="1180359" wikidata="Q737560" url="?curid=1180359" title="Neo-Kantianism">
<text>In late modern philosophy, neo-Kantianism () was a revival of the 18th-century philosophy of Immanuel Kant. The neo-Kantians sought to develop and clarify Kant&#x27;s theories, particularly his concept of the thing-in-itself and his moral philosophy.

== Origins ==
The &quot;back to Kant&quot; movement began in the 1860s, as a reaction to the German materialist controversy in the 1850s.

In addition to the work of Hermann von Helmholtz and Eduard Zeller, early fruits of the movement were Kuno Fischer&#x27;s works on Kant and Friedrich Albert Lange&#x27;s &quot;History of Materialism&quot; (&quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot;, 1873–75), the latter of which argued that transcendental idealism superseded the historic struggle between material idealism and mechanistic materialism. Fischer was earlier involved in a dispute with the Aristotelian idealist Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg concerning the interpretation of the results of the Transcendental Aesthetic, a dispute that prompted Hermann Cohen&#x27;s 1871 seminal work &quot;Kants Theorie der Erfahrung&quot; (&quot;Kant&#x27;s Theory of Experience&quot;), a book often regarded as the foundation of 20th-century neo-Kantianism. It is in reference to the Fischer–Trendelenburg debate and Cohen&#x27;s work that Hans Vaihinger started his massive commentary on the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

== Varieties ==
The several schools of thought, in spite of seeing themselves as united by a common movement, often saw massive fundamental disagreements.

Hermann Cohen became the leader of the Marburg School (centered in the town of the same name), the other prominent representatives of which were Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer.

Another important group, the Southwest (German) School (also known as the Heidelberg School or Baden School, centered in Heidelberg, Baden in Southwest Germany) included Wilhelm Windelband, Heinrich Rickert and Ernst Troeltsch. The Marburg School emphasized epistemology and philosophical logic, whereas the Southwest school emphasized issues of culture and value theory (notably the fact–value distinction).

A third group, mainly represented by Leonard Nelson, established the neo-Friesian School (named after post-Kantian philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries) which emphasized philosophy of science.

The neo-Kantian schools tended to emphasize scientific readings of Kant, often downplaying the role of intuition in favour of concepts. However, the ethical aspects of neo-Kantian thought often drew them within the orbit of socialism, and they had an important influence on Austromarxism and the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein. Lange and Cohen in particular were keen on this connection between Kantian thought and socialism. Another important aspect of the neo-Kantian movement was its attempt to promote a revised notion of Judaism, particularly in Cohen&#x27;s seminal work, one of the few works of the movement available in English translation.

The neo-Kantian school was of importance in devising a division of philosophy that has had durable influence well beyond Germany. It made early use of terms such as epistemology and upheld its prominence over ontology. Natorp had a decisive influence on the history of phenomenology and is often credited with leading Edmund Husserl to adopt the vocabulary of transcendental idealism. Emil Lask was influenced by Edmund Husserl&#x27;s work, and himself exerted a remarkable influence on the young Martin Heidegger. The debate between Cassirer and Heidegger over the interpretation of Kant led the latter to formulate reasons for viewing Kant as a forerunner of phenomenology; this view was disputed in important respects by Eugen Fink. An abiding achievement of the neo-Kantians was the founding of the journal &quot;Kant-Studien&quot;, which still survives today.

By 1933 (after the rise of Nazism), the various neo-Kantian circles in Germany had dispersed.

== Further influence ==

The Neo-Kantian movement had a significant impact on the development of 20th-century philosophy, particularly in the areas of epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. It continues to be an important influence on contemporary philosophy, particularly in the fields of social and political philosophy.

Towards the end of 1898 G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell rebelled against Kant and Hegel who were the leading philosophers within British and American universities at that time. Neo-Kantianism was banned out of them for the following fifty years and continued to survive solely in the Continental Philosophy. In the 1960s Strawson published &quot;The Bounds of Sense&quot;, which relaunched Neo-Kantianism while proposing to deny its doctrine of transcendental idealism. John Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971) restored Kantian practical philosophy of the categorical imperative.

==Contemporary neo-Kantianism==
In the analytic tradition, the revival of interest in the work of Kant that has been underway since Peter Strawson&#x27;s work &quot;The Bounds of Sense&quot; (1966) can also be viewed as effectively neo-Kantian, not least due to its continuing emphasis on epistemology at the expense of ontology. Around the same time as Strawson, Wilfrid Sellars also renewed interest in Kant&#x27;s philosophy. His project of introducing a Kantian turn in contemporary analytic philosophy has been taken up by his student Robert Brandom. Brandom&#x27;s work has transformed Sellars&#x27; project to introducing a Hegelian phase in analytic philosophy. In the 1980s, interest in neo-Kantianism has revived in the wake of the work of Gillian Rose, who is a critic of this movement&#x27;s influence on modern philosophy, and because of its influence on the work of Max Weber. The Kantian concern for the limits of perception strongly influenced the antipositivist sociological movement in late 19th-century Germany, particularly in the work of Georg Simmel (Simmel&#x27;s question &#x27;What is society?&#x27; is a direct allusion to Kant&#x27;s own: &#x27;What is nature&#x27;?). The current work of Michael Friedman is explicitly neo-Kantian.

Continental philosophers drawing on the Kantian understandings of the transcendental include Jean-François Lyotard and Jean-Luc Nancy.

Classical conservative thinker Roger Scruton has been greatly influenced by Kantian ethics and aesthetics.

<doc id="1180369" wikidata="Q6390506" url="?curid=1180369" title="Kenneth Muir (British Army officer)">
<text>Major Kenneth Muir VC (6 March 1912 – 23 September 1950) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Muir was born on 6 March 1912, the son of captain (later colonel) Garnet Wolseley Muir, who became commanding officer of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1923. Muir was educated at Malvern College and was commissioned 2nd lieutenant in the Argylls in 1932, aged 20. He served on the north-west frontier of India from 1935 to 1938, and during the Second World War saw active service in the Sudan, north Africa, Italy, France, and Germany. At the end of the war he held the rank of acting lieutenant-colonel and had been mentioned in dispatches.

After service with the provost marshal&#x27;s branch of the War Office, in early 1950 Major Muir was posted to the Argylls&#x27; 1st battalion in Hong Kong. In August 1950 the battalion moved to Korea, among the first British troops to join the United Nations forces in the Korean War.

===Victoria Cross action===
Major Muir was 38 years old, and second in command of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders during the Korean War, when the following deed took place at the Battle of Hill 282 for which he was posthumously awarded the VC:

On 23 September 1950, as part of the breakout from Pusan, the Argylls were ordered to take and hold Hill 282, near Songju, which was dominated by another higher feature, Hill 388, about 1500 metres to the west. Two companies of the battalion took the hill, but were heavily counter-attacked by superior numbers of North Koreans from Hill 388. The USAF also napalmed and machine-gunned the hill in an egregious ‘friendly fire’ incident. Muir had initially gone forward with a stretcher party to supervise the evacuation of the wounded. When the enemy started to launch a further series of attacks, Muir took command and galvanised the defence by personal example. On the hill&#x27;s summit, where the fighting was most desperate, he directed fire, organised ammunition distribution, and collected the wounded into shelter, while encouraging others by his disregard for the heavy enemy fire hitting the hilltop.

Eventually, with losses mounting and enemy reinforcements continually arriving from Hill 388, Muir called for an American air strike on that hill. In spite of coloured recognition panels placed on Hill 282 to mark the Argylls&#x27; position, the aircraft attacked Hill 282 in error, the Argylls suffering heavy casualties. Despite this, Muir organised a successful counter-attack on the North Koreans with the twenty or so survivors. Finally, with only fourteen men unwounded, Muir was mortally wounded while firing a 2-inch mortar himself. His last words were: &#x27;Neither the Gooks nor the US Air Force will drive the Argylls off this hill&#x27;. His citation noted that: &quot;The effect of [Muir&#x27;s] splendid leadership on the men was nothing short of amazing and it was entirely due to his magnificent courage and example and the spirit which he imbued in those about him that all wounded were evacuated from the hill, and, as was subsequently discovered, very heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy in the defence of the crest.&quot;

==Burial==
Initially buried in the Taegu Military Cemetery, his remains were exhumed and transferred to the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, Busan, Korea, on 14 May 1951. His name is also recorded on his father&#x27;s headstone at St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Frimley, Surrey, England.

==Honours==
Muir&#x27;s parents received his Victoria Cross from King George VI on 14 February 1951.

He was awarded the following medals, which are displayed at the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum, Stirling Castle, Scotland.
The award of the American Distinguished Service Cross to Muir was, like his VC, a posthumous one.

<doc id="1180373" wikidata="Q4891507" url="?curid=1180373" title="Bergen County Line">
<text>The Bergen County Line is a commuter rail line and service owned and operated by New Jersey Transit in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The line loops off the Main Line between the Meadowlands and Glen Rock, with trains continuing in either direction along the Main Line. It is colored on NJT system maps in grey, and its symbol is a cattail, which are commonly found in the Meadowlands where the line runs.

Some trains of Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Port Jervis Line also operate over the line. The Norfolk Southern Railway provides freight service along the line via trackage rights.

As on the Main Line, trains are powered by diesel locomotives operated push-pull, consisting of Comet or MultiLevel coaches.

==History==

From a point in Secaucus, just south of the Hackensack River bridge near the former Harmon Cove station, to a point in East Rutherford north of the Rutherford station, the Bergen County Line uses the former Erie Railroad Main Line. This portion was opened in 1833 by the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad and leased by the New York and Erie Rail Road in 1852. The rest of the line, from East Rutherford north to Glen Rock, opened in 1881 as the Bergen County Railroad.

Until the late 1950s, the main function of the Erie&#x27;s Bergen County Cutoff was as a freight (and long-distance express) bypass of the at-grade Main Line through Passaic. Commuter service was relatively minor. In 1963 the Lackawanna Boonton Branch up to Paterson (with a small portion of the Erie&#x27;s Newark Branch) became the new Erie-Lackawanna Main Line. This was caused by the abandonment of the Main Line section through downtown Passaic and construction of Interstate 80 using the old Boonton Branch right-of-way in Paterson. The old Main Line east of Rutherford was now exclusively part of the Bergen County Line.

Prior to the opening of Secaucus Junction in 2003, Bergen County Line trains used a longer stretch of the old Erie Main Line in Secaucus, extending south to Croxton Yard and a merge with the former Lackawanna Boonton Branch. A curving track was built between the HX Drawbridge at Hackensack River and the Main Line west of Secaucus Junction to allow Bergen County Line trains to use the new station.

=== Secaucus train collision ===

On February 9, 1996, a Bergen County Line train collided with a Main Line train, killing 3 people and injuring 162. It was the New York City area and New Jersey&#x27;s worst train accident since the 1958 Newark Bay rail accident when at least 48 people died.

=== 2007 Ridgewood Junction derailment ===

On February 21, 2007, a Bergen County Line train suffered a minor derailment after passing over an improperly repaired switch at Ridgewood Junction.

==Service==
West of Secaucus Junction, the Bergen County Line tracks diverge from the Main Line over a new right-of-way opened on December 15, 2003, connecting the Main Line with the Bergen County Line. During this stretch and traveling westbound, the Hackensack River is to the left, while industrial plants on Meadowlands Parkway are to the right. A former station, Harmon Cove, was located nearby along the old Erie right-of-way and served the high-rise apartments nearby between 1978 and 2003.

Soon the train joins the old Erie Main Line right-of-way and crosses the Hackensack over HX Bridge, a two-track bascule draw. For the next two miles, the train crosses the Meadowlands, under the New Jersey Turnpike western spur with the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford visible in the distance to the right. Here, the track parallels Berrys Creek and eventually crosses it just before passing below Route 3.

Beyond Route 3, the landscape changes to industrial. Office buildings line the side of the track, some serviced by sidings. The Pascack Valley Line soon splits off to the right at Pascack Junction, and the train then crosses Route 17 and approaches the Rutherford station.

For a half-mile the train passes residences on either side, then swings right, abandoning the old Erie Main Line at , and passes through industrial areas with several grade crossings. Soon, the tracks form the border of Carlstadt and Wallington. Presently the train passes Wood-Ridge and South Hackensack before reaching the Wesmont station, which opened on May 15, 2016. The train then swings left, crossing the Saddle River, and then right, into Garfield reaching the Garfield station.

The train continues northward through Garfield, passing homes, businesses, and Dahnerts Lake County Park before reaching the Plauderville station at Midland Avenue, the border between Garfield and neighboring Saddle Brook. Shortly after passing beneath U.S. Highway 46 the track becomes the border of Saddle Brook and Elmwood Park, once again crossing Midland Avenue. Interstate 80 passes above the train, which then crosses the Garden State Parkway. The Broadway station in Fair Lawn straddles a border formed by the track and Route 4.

In Fair Lawn, the line is paralleled by Plaza Road, named for Radburn Plaza, the commercial area serving the Radburn development for which the borough&#x27;s more northerly station is named. The line crosses below Route 208 before reaching Radburn. Beyond the station, the train passes housing to the right and industry to the left, with a spur to a Nabisco plant. Next is the Glen Rock–Boro Hall station which like its Main Line counterpart is on Rock Road. The lines merge a short distance north of this point at Ridgewood Junction. The trains will continue north to either Waldwick or Suffern, and some peak trains will terminate at Ridgewood, which is the first station after the two lines join.

<text>Vahid Hashemian Korbekandi (; born 21 July 1976) is an Iranian football coach and former player. He subsequently worked as assistant coach to Dragan Skočić at Iran national team during his tenure. He played as a forward, spending most of his career in Germany. He made 50 appearances for the Iran national team scoring 15 goals.

==Club career==
Hashemian started his professional football career with Pas Tehran in his homeland. He arrived in Germany for the 1999–2000 season to play for Hamburger SV. Playing alongside his fellow Iranian international Mehdi Mahdavikia, he had just 12 appearances, so he left the club for VfL Bochum to show his real ability. He had three good seasons with Bochum, scoring 34 goals in 87 appearances. During his last season there he scored 16 goals, helping Bochum to finish fifth in the Bundesliga and qualify for the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. This prompted Bayern Munich to grant him in a €2 million contract, hence giving him the chance to follow in the footsteps of Ali Daei. After one season with Bayern Munich, he joined Hannover 96 at the start of the 2005–06 season. On 23 April 2008, VfL Bochum officials announced that he would return to their club in the season 2008–09. Hashemian signed a two-year contract with an option for one extra year. He scored only one goal for the team and was benched most of the times in his first season. On 30 December 2010, Hashemian signed a deal with Iran Pro League side Persepolis. Where he was able to win the Hazfi Cup. On 19 July 2011, he extended his contract with the Iranian club Persepolis for another year. On 20 May 2012, it was announced that he will be leaving the club at the end of the season. On 21 July 2012, on his 36th birthday, he announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
Hashemian debuted for the Iran national team on 1 December 1998 in a friendly match against Kazakhstan. After the 2000 Asian Cup he refused to play for &quot;Team Melli&quot; but after four years finally decided to come and help his country to qualify for the World Cup. Hashemian was a key player for Iran national team in recent years and scored vital goals for the national team, such as netting an important goal in a World Cup qualification game against Qatar in October 2004, as well as scoring two magnificent goals in a win over Japan in Tehran in March 2005. He played all three of Iran&#x27;s games in the 2006 World Cup.

He started in the line-up in all the games at 2007 Asian Cup, under Amir Ghalenoi, but declined to play for the Iran national team in the first round of 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifying. Hashemian was later invited for the second round of World Cup Qualifying playing in Iran&#x27;s 1–1 tie versus Saudi Arabia. He announced that he would retire from the national team and he wished to coach &quot;Team Melli&quot; when he retires from football.

==Coaching career==
Hashemian gained his UEFA B Licence in 2008 while playing in Bundesliga, before completing his A Licence in 2012. Hashemian was named as one of the 24 coaches handpicked by the DFB to take part in its 10-month course, &quot;Fußballlehrer&quot;, in 2014. He also took a three-weeks internship under Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich, as part of the program, and obtained the german certificate equivalent to UEFA Pro Licence.

===Oberliga Hamburg (2012–13)===
Hashemian then started his coaching career in Oberliga Hamburg, where he worked for the next 14 months. Accepting a job offer by Thomas Bliemeister, then-coach of SV Halstenbek-Rellingen who took position as the club&#x27;s technical director, he was appointed as the coach on 26 October 2012. In July 2013 he signed with Niendorfer TSV, but left the team in the mid-season in order to pursue his professional training.

===Hamburger SV (2017–18)===
In early 2017, Hashemian signed a contract with Hamburger SV and was assigned as an individual trainer at the club&#x27;s youth academy for six months. During the 2017–18 season, he was assistant to the club&#x27;s U17 coach, Pit Reimers. Replacing Steffen Weiß, the club officially appointed him as the coach of its reserve team in April 2018, because his &quot;Fußballlehrer&quot; license prevented a lawsuit against the club by demoted players Walace and Mërgim Mavraj, while the former coach did not have any. A few days later, Achim Feifel took over the team and Hashemian was returned to his old job. By the end of season, Weiß remained to coach the reserve team again for the next season and Hashemian rejected an offer to extend his contract as a youth academy trainer He left HSV in May 2018, when the contract expired.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
In July 2012, his wife Bita gave birth to a daughter named Elena.

===Business activities===
Hashemian has registered a trademark named &quot;German Sports&quot;, in order to produce and sell sports equipment under his own name. He has founded German Home LTP GmbH, a company in Germany that specializes in exporting home appliances to Iran.

<text>River Cottage Forever is the third in the &quot;River Cottage&quot; Channel 4 series franchise, following on from Escape to River Cottage and Return to River Cottage in which chef and journalist Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall de-camped from the rat-race of city living to move to the rolling hills of the Dorset countryside, which provided the perfect backdrop for his experiment to live off the fat of the land in as self-sufficient a style as possible, tucked away at the bottom of one of the Dorset valleys is the ideal home: River Cottage.

In his first year Fearnley-Whittingstall had just the cottage and the garden but he soon found he needed more land. In his second year he negotiated a deal with a neighbour to rent four acres (≃16,200 m2). His smallholding now boasted a polytunnel for growing vegetables, a fox-proof high rise chicken accommodation and a pasture for his sheep, cows and pigs.

<doc id="1180392" wikidata="Q819538" url="?curid=1180392" title="Heart of Glass (film)">
<text>Heart of Glass () is a 1976 German film directed and produced by Werner Herzog, set in 18th century Bavaria. The film was written by Herzog, based partly on a story by Herbert Achternbusch. The main character is Hias, based on the legendary Bavarian prophet Mühlhiasl.

==Plot==
The setting is an 18th-century Bavarian town with a glassblowing factory that produces a brilliant ruby glass. When the master glass blower dies, the secret of producing it is lost. The local Baron, who owns the factory, is obsessed with the ruby glass and believes it to have magical properties. With the loss of the secret, he descends into madness along with the rest of the townspeople. The main character is Hias, a seer from the hills, who predicts the destruction of the factory in a fire.

==Production==
During shooting, almost all of the actors performed while under hypnosis. Every actor in every scene was hypnotized, with the exception of the character Hias and the professional glassblowers who appear in the film. The hypnotized actors give very strange performances, which Herzog intended to suggest the trance-like state of the townspeople in the story. Herzog provided the actors with most of their dialogue, memorised during hypnosis. However, many of the hypnotised actors&#x27; gestures and movements occurred spontaneously during filming.

The majority of the film was shot in Bavaria, just a few miles from where Herzog was raised in the remote village of Sachrang (nestled in the Chiemgau Alps), and also at a nearby village in Switzerland. Other brief shots of landscape scenes were filmed in various locations around the world that Herzog scouted out, including Yellowstone National Park and the Viamala canyon. The conclusion of the film was shot on the Skellig Islands.

Herzog, along with other members of the crew, has a cameo as one of the men carrying a load of ruby glass to the lake.

==Release==
The film was screened at the London Film Festival on 1 and 2 December 1976.

<text>The Dâmbovița () is a river in Romania. It has its sources on the Curmătura Oticului, a mountain pass that separates the Iezer Mountains from the Făgăraș Mountains proper. It passes through Bucharest and flows into the river Argeș near Budești, in Călărași County. Its length is and its basin size is . Dâmbovița County is named after the river.

==Name==
The name of the Dâmbovița is of Slavic origin, derived from Common Slavic &quot;&quot; (дѫбъ), meaning &quot;oak&quot;, as it once flowed through the oak forests of the Wallachian Plain. Its upper course, upstream from the Valea Vladului, is also called &quot;Valea Boarcășului&quot;.

==Dâmbovița in Bucharest==
For centuries, Dâmbovița was the main source of drinking water for the city of Bucharest. While there were a few dozen water wells, most of the water in Bucharest was distributed by water-carriers.

Bucharest folklore mentions the waters of Dâmbovița as &quot;sweet&quot;, and even at the beginning of the 18th century, Anton Maria del Chiaro considered it &quot;light and clean&quot;. However, toward the end of the 18th century, as the population of Bucharest increased, the river ceased to be as clean, and hence the need of the aqueducts. The earliest aqueducts with public fountains (&quot;cișmele&quot;) were built during the rule of Prince Alexander Ypsilantis.

Many watermills were built on the Dâmbovița, most of them owned by the prince, the monasteries or boyars.

Dâmbovița used to have two tributaries in Bucharest: 
* Dâmbovicioara, on the right bank, which probably flowed in what is the area where &quot;Sființii Apostoli&quot; street is located.
* Bucureștioara, which rose from a pond located in what is now Grădina Icoanei.
Additionally, there was a branch, &quot;Gârlița&quot;, which formed an island, &quot;Ostrovu&quot;.

The Dâmbovița often flooded Bucharest, especially the left bank, which was lower. After the great 1775 flood, Ypsilantis ordered a branch canal to be built, in order to prevent, or at least diminish the effects of such flooding; in 1813, Prince Ioan Caragea decided to clean up the river bed. The portion of the river flowing through the capital was channelled twice: in 1883 (to combat regular floods), and in the late 1970s, to aid in the replanning of the Central area and the construction of the Bucharest Metro. To prevent floods, in 1986 a dam was built between the Crângași and Militari quarters, and Morii Lake artificial lake was created.

Dâmbovița has never been navigable, but there has been an unsuccessful attempt in 1902 to introduce boats on the river.

Early in its history, Bucharest had few bridges over the Dâmbovița, as the right bank was only sparsely populated. The estates of some boyars used to extend on both banks of the river and they had footbridges. Currently, there are sixteen bridges over Dâmbovița River in central Bucharest.

==Glina Wastewater Station==
The Dâmbovița was polluted before the opening in 2011 of the Glina Wastewater Station, the biggest ecological project in Romania, which treats the sewage water that pours into the channel which is built below the river floor. Before entering Bucharest, the river&#x27;s water is already treated by the company &quot;Compania de Apă Târgoviște&quot;. After exiting Bucharest, the Dâmbovița water were polluted, due to the hundreds of millions of cubic meters of raw sewage that were dumped every year directly into the channel below the river, but now the quality of water is much improved.

In Bucharest, the river is vertically divided into 2 separated parts. In the lower part, under the Dâmbovița river floor, there is a channel which contains the sewage from the city. The two flows join into a single flow when exiting Bucharest. There are river plants and fish that live in the upper side of the river and sometimes one can even see some fishermen on the shores.

The quality of the water was very much improved as of October 10, 2011 with the opening of Glina Wastewater Station, which is the first sewage treatment plant of Bucharest, with a capacity of , while a second one, which will clean all the water (with a capacity of 12 m3/s) should be finalized by 2015.

<text>Ferenc Szisz (September 20, 1873 – February 21, 1944), was a Hungarian racing driver and the winner of the first Grand Prix motor racing event on a Renault AK 90CV on 26 June, 1906.

==Early life==
Szisz was born in the small town of Szeghalom in Békés county of the Hungarian part the former Austro-Hungarian Empire on September 20, 1873. He was trained to be a locksmith and a coppersmith but in his early twenties the growing proliferation of automobiles fascinated Szisz and he studied engineering along with car design. After time spent in several Austrian and German cities, in the spring of 1900 he ended up in Paris, France where he found work at the new Renault automobile company.

==Grand Prix career==
At Renault, Szisz&#x27;s engineering talent made him an integral part of the testing department, and when the company became involved in racing in 1902 he was chosen as the riding mechanic for Louis Renault. Following the death of Marcel Renault in the 1903 Paris-Madrid race, Szisz took over as a driver. In 1905, he finished fifth in the Gordon Bennett Cup elimination race on the Circuit d&#x27;Auvergne at Clermont-Ferrand. In October of that same year, along with other French and Italian automobile manufacturers, Renault sent a team to the United States to compete in the Vanderbilt Cup on Long Island, New York. In a field that included Felice Nazzaro and Louis Chevrolet driving for Fiat, Szisz finished fifth behind the winner, fellow Frenchman Victor Hémery driving a Darracq.
Szisz&#x27;s primary duties as the head of testing at Renault limited the number of races he could compete in. However, in 1906 he achieved a permanent place in the annals of auto racing when he and his riding mechanic M. Marteau drove a Renault AK 90CV to victory in the first Grand Prix race in Le Mans. He averaged . His victory in the French Grand Prix and the commercial success of the race soon led to the establishing of other Grand Prix races throughout Europe. The following year, Italy&#x27;s Felice Nazzaro, who had finished second behind Szisz, captured the second French Grand Prix. Szisz competed in the 1908 race but did not finish and suffered a similar fate following mechanical problems in Savannah, Georgia at an American Grand Prize race organized by the Automobile Club of America.

In early 1909, Szisz left Renault to open his own garage in Neuilly-sur-Seine. In July 1914, Fernand Charron lured him out of retirement to drive an Alda in the French Grand Prix at Lyon. In a race won by Christian Lautenschlager in a Mercedes, Szisz was honored with the number 1 for his car, but an injury forced him out just past half the distance.

==World War I==
European automobile racing ended in September with the onset of World War I and Szisz joined the French army, serving as head of the transport troops in Algeria until being hospitalized with typhoid fever.

==Later life==
At war&#x27;s end, he went to work for an aircraft company until his retirement to a cottage in the country at Auffargis not far from Paris, where he died in 1944.

Ferenc Szisz and his wife are buried in the churchyard cemetery in Auffargis. The Szisz Museum is part of the Renault Museum located near the Le Mans racetrack.

<text>Peter Frank George Twinn (9 January 1916 – 29 October 2004) was an English mathematician, Second World War codebreaker and entomologist. He was the first mathematician to be recruited to GC&amp;CS, Head of Intelligence Service Knox (ISK) from 1943, the unit responsible for decrypting over 100,000 Abwehr communications.

==Early life and education==
Born in Streatham, South London, Twinn was the son of a senior General Post Office official. After attending Manchester Grammar School and Dulwich College, he graduated in mathematics at Brasenose College, Oxford. He won a scholarship to pursue postgraduate studies in physics.

==Cryptography==

Twinn was the first mathematician to join GC&amp;CS. In early 1939, he applied after seeing an advertisement, working first in London before moving to Bletchley Park. He worked with Dilly Knox and Alan Turing on German Enigma ciphers. In early 1942, he became the head of the Abwehr Enigma section.

===Recruitment to GC&amp;CS===

He was in the middle of a postgraduate scholarship studying Physics when he saw an advertisement for a job with the government. &quot;I was a bit unsettled,&quot; he remembered. &quot;I&#x27;d finished my university degree and I didn&#x27;t quite know what to do.&quot; The advertisement indicated that they were looking for mathematicians, but was unclear about what else was involved.

In that unsettled period after the Munich Agreement, international relations between the major European powers were tense and getting tenser.

&quot; They offered me this job at the princely salary of, I think, £275 a year,&quot; he said, &quot;which sounded all right to me, and I was taken along on the first day to be introduced to Dilly Knox.&quot; He began as an assistant to Alfred Dilwyn (&quot;Dilly&quot;) Knox, who headed a team of codebreakers at GC&amp;CS.

An eccentric but brilliant character, Dilly Knox was the first British codebreaker to work on the Enigma cipher. Like most GC&amp;CS experts, he was a classicist. But, as war loomed, GC&amp;CS began employing mathematicians, as well as chess players and crossword experts.

Knox believed in throwing his new recruits in at the deep end. He gave Twinn a mere five minutes&#x27; training before telling him to go and get on with it.

===Lead up to war===

Twinn was the first British cryptographer to read a German military Enigma message, having obtained vital information from Polish cryptanalysts in July 1939. Twinn said that &quot;It was a trifling exercise, but I repeat for the umpteenth time, no credit to me.&quot;

In July 1939 GC&amp;CS moved from London to Bletchley Park. The mansion in the park was used by the staff, but many other buildings had to be constructed to accommodate the large number of people who worked for GC&amp;CS during the war. These temporary buildings were known as the &quot;huts&quot;.

===World War II===

====Enigma==== 
The Enigma machine dated back to 1919, when Hugo Alexander Koch, a Dutchman, patented an invention that he called a secret writing machine. Soon Arthur Scherbius, an engineer, was experimenting with this and similar machines and became enthusiastic about encryption machines that used rotors. He recommended them to Siegfried Turkel, the director of the Institute of Criminology in Vienna, who also became interested in them.

In the meantime, Koch had set up a company with the hope of selling his encryption machine for commercial use; one disadvantage was that numbers had to be spelt out in words. Industry was not interested, but in 1926 the German Navy looked at the Koch machine. Senior officers were impressed with it and ordered a large number. The purchase of the device – called Enigma – was kept strictly secret.

The Enigma machine was complicated, with a keyboard, like the ones used on a typewriter, containing all the letters of the alphabet. Each of the 26 letters was connected electrically to one of three rotors, each provided with a ring. Each ring also held the 26 letters of the alphabet. Further electrical connections led from the rotors to 26 illuminated letters.

When an operator, enciphering a message, pressed a key, an electric current passed through the machine and the rotors turned mechanically, but not in unison. Every time a key was pushed, the first rotor would rotate one letter. This happened 26 times until the first rotor had made a complete revolution. Then the second rotor would start to rotate. And so on.

When a key was pressed, a light came on behind the cipher text letter, always different from the original letter in the plain text. The illuminated letters made up the coded message.

The system worked in reverse. The person decoding a cipher message would use an Enigma with identical settings. When he pressed the cipher text letter, the letter in the original plain text message lit up. The illuminated letters made up the original message.

To make the codes more difficult to break, each of the rotors could be taken out and replaced in a different order. Also, the rings on the rotors could be put in a different order each day – for example, on one day the first rotor could be set at B, the next day at F, and so on.
The military version of Enigma was provided with a plug board, like an old telephone switchboard. This allowed an extra switching of the letters, both before they entered the rotors and after leaving them. The plug board had 26 holes. Connections were made with wires and plugs. With three rotors and, say, six pairs of letters connected with the plug board, there would be 105,456 different combinations of the alphabet.

In December 1938 the Germans added additional rotors (up to six) and the number of combinations increased dramatically. The Germans believed that messages sent on their most sophisticated Enigma machines were so well coded that they could not be decoded. But Twinn and his colleagues proved them wrong.

About 10,000 people worked at Bletchley. The core group was the small number of cryptanalysts trying to crack the Enigma machine; at the beginning, this group consisted of no more than ten people, with Knox and Twinn in charge.

The British codebreakers had been working on the commercial version of Enigma, the easier of the two to break, during the 1920s and 1930s, and they had made much progress in breaking the military version. But Twinn and his colleagues were stymied because they could not work out the order in which the Enigma keys were wired up.

In July 1939, a month or so before the war started, Knox and some others travelled to Poland. Polish cryptologists, some of whom were brilliant, handed over to their British colleagues key information about Enigma, including replica machines.

The British discovered that Enigma machines were wired alphabetically: A to the first contact, B to the second, and so on. This was the order given in the diagram attached to the patent application. But Twinn and his colleagues thought it such an obvious thing to do that nobody considered it worth trying.

In early 1940 Twinn made the first break into Enigma. This could have been done much earlier if only they had tried the alphabetical system detailed in the patent application.

The ability to read German encoded military messages was of inestimable help to the Allies in winning the war. It was achieved largely because of the efforts of Twinn, Knox, Alan Turing (who later became the father of artificial intelligence) and others at Bletchley Park. Turing, a brilliant mathematician, developed a machine called the “bombe”, which speeded up the deciphering process by trial and error — a crucial development for the codebreakers.

====German Naval Enigma====

Twinn worked with Turing on breaking the German Naval Enigma. Their success helped allied convoys to avoid German U-boats.

====Intelligence Services Knox====

In October 1941, Dilly Knox solved the Abwehr Enigma. ISK was established to decrypt Abwehr communications. In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, Twinn took change of running ISK and was appointed head after Knox&#x27;s death. By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages.

Intelligence gained from these Abwehr decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of Double-Cross operations by MI5 and M16, and in Operation Fortitude, the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about D-Day.

==Post-war career==
Twinn&#x27;s carried on government work after the war in a number of departments, including, in the late 1960s, as Director of Hovercraft in the Ministry for Technology. Later he became Secretary of the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. In the early 1970s, he was the second secretary of the Natural Environment Research Council. He was appointed CBE in the 1980 Birthday Honours.

Twinn became interested in entomology, gaining his doctorate from the University of London in the jumping mechanism of click beetles. He co-authored &quot;A Provisional Atlas of the Longhorn Beetle (Coleoptera Cerambycidae)&quot; (1999), a study of the distribution of a number of beetle species.

Twinn had an interest in music and played the clarinet and viola. Twinn married Rosamund Case, whom he had met at Bletchley Park through his interest in music, in 1944; they had a son and three daughters.

<text>The Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf Railroad Company was a railroad that ran westward from Starke, Florida, eventually terminating at Wannee, Florida, on the Suwannee River. It was later absorbed by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad becoming their Wannee Subdivision.

==Construction==
The Starke to Wannee rail line was initiated in 1891 with the incorporation of the Starke and Sampson City Railway Company. The company failed after grading the right-of-way from Starke to Sampson City, and in 1892 transferred the right-of-way to the Ambler Lumber Co.

The Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf Railroad (ASR&amp;G) was incorporated under the general incorporation laws of Florida in 1893. Shortly after incorporation, the company purchased the graded right-of-way between Starke and Sampson City from the Ambler Lumber Company and contracted with the Atlantic Lumber Company (successor to the Ambler Lumber Company) to lay the track. The track from Starke reached Sampson City in August, 1863, and LaCrosse in March, 1894. After a pause, The track reached Alachua in July, 1896, and Buda, between High Springs and Newberry, in July, 1897. The Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (FC&amp;PR) leased the ASR&amp;G in 1899, and contracted with the Atlantic Lumber Company to extend the line to Wannee, a distance of . With completion of the Wannee extension in 1902 the line was long. The completed line was standard gauge and single-track. The ASR&amp;GR under FC&amp;PR control operated the line from Starke to Buda, and the Atlantic Lumber Company operated the line from Buda to Wannee. Operation of both the FC&amp;PR and the ASR&amp;GR was taken over by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in July, 1900, and both were formally adsorbed by the SAL in June, 1903. From its founding until its absorption by the SAL, the ASR&amp;GR had served primarily to feed timber and lumber to the FC&amp;PR.

==Later history==
The Seaboard Air Line removed the track between Wannee and Bell in the 1930s. Much of the line west of Brooker was abandoned after the Seaboard Air Line merged with its competitor, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, in 1967. The track from Buda to Bell would remain as a spur of the West Coast Subdivision (an ex-ACL line) until the 1980s.

The Seaboard Coast Line became CSX Transportation in the 1980s. In the 1990s, CSX rebuilt a short segment of the Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf Railway to Hainesworth to reconnect with the remains of the former Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad, which had just been severed from its system. This segment is now CSX Transportation&#x27;s Brooker Subdivision and is still in service. The line&#x27;s connection with the CSX S Line is still known as Wannee Junction.

<text>Major General and Lewa Pasha Charles George Baker (8 December 1830 – 19 February 1906) was a British Merchant Navy officer, a Bengal Army officer, a Turkish Army officer, and head of the Egyptian Police.

He was responsible for the rescue of the passengers and crew of the wrecked Steamship Douro. He was also a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He subsequently went on to serve in the Turkish Army, becoming a Major General and Lewa Pasha. Following this he became head of the Egyptian Police Force.

==Early life==
Charles George Baker was born in Noacolly (Noakhali), Bengal, British India on 8 December 1830 to John and Lydia Baker from Suffolk. John Baker was a Doctor in the East India Company&#x27;s Medical Service. The young Baker was sent to England to be educated, attending schools in Halesworth and Lowestoft in Suffolk.

==Wreck of the Douro==

While an employee of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in 1854, Baker was serving as Second Officer aboard the Douro, a passenger vessel. As the ship was sailing near the Paracel Islands it struck the north shoal and was wrecked. On 26 May, accompanied by seven volunteers, Baker took a Jolly boat and set out for Hainan which he estimated was away. According to the log he kept, on arrival at the island of Hainan they were unable to locate signs of habitation, so the decision was made by him to head for Hong Kong. The first vessels they encountered on their journey turned out to be pirates who refused food, water, and other assistance unless the crew allowed themselves to be stripped of all valuables. The boat was able to escape, facing adverse weather conditions and taking on water.

After a journey totalling over , the boat reached Hong Kong on the morning of 3 June. Baker reported the wreck, and was successful in securing rescue for the passengers and crew of the Douro, with the Steamships Malta, Tartar, and Pekin arriving at the site of the wreck on 5, 6 and 8 June respectively. The only loss of life from this incident was a member of the ship&#x27;s crew who had fallen overboard.

==Military service==
Shortly afterwards Baker found employment in the East India Company&#x27;s Bengal Army, eventually joining the Bengal Military Police Battalion under then-Captain Thomas Rattray. He was appointed as Second in Command of the Bengal Military Police Battalion on its formation, on 15 April 1856, while simultaneously holding the positions within the unit of Commandant of Cavalry and Officiating Commandant. Baker served with them through the Indian Mutiny.

===Victoria Cross===

He was 27 years old, and a lieutenant during September 1858 when the cavalry portion of the Bengal Military Police Battalion was assigned to the Field Force commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel William West Turner , then responsible for the security of the Grand Trunk Road.

====Baker&#x27;s report====
On 27 September Lt. Baker sent the following despatch to Lt. Col. Turner, detailing action at Suhejnee (Sahejani), near Peroo (Piro), Bhojpur:

&quot;Lieutenant C. G. Baker, Commandant of Cavalry, 1st Bengal Police Battalion, to Captain Gordon, Field Adjutant, Lieutenant-Colonel Turner&#x27;s Field Force. &lt;br&gt; Camp Munjhaen, &lt;br&gt; September 27, 1858.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

SIR, 
FOR the information of Lieutenant-Colonel
Turner, C.B., Commanding Field Force, I have
the honour to report the details of a successful
attack by the cavalry detachments under my command,
upon the rebel force at Suhejnee, near
Peroo, which resulted in the total rout of the
enemy, whose loss is estimated at from 80 to 90
killed and many wounded, with but a comparatively
small list of casualties on our side.

In compliance with the orders of the officer
commanding the field force, the detachments of
cavalry noted in the margin [&quot;&quot;] marched at about
1 P.M. yesterday, with the view of intercepting
the retreat of the rebel force posted in the village
of Suhejnee, distant five miles.

On nearing the village above mentioned, I
discovered the enemy in possession of it, as well
as in occupation of all the neighbouring topes of
trees, sugar-cane khets, &amp;c., from which positions
a heavy fire was at once opened. An irregular
fire at intervals from the adjacent village of Nonar
proved that place to be also held by the mutineer
force.

Requesting Lieutenant Broughton, with the
3rd Seikh Irregular Cavalry, to take up a position
to the north-west of Suhejnee, clear of the
enemy&#x27;s fire, which was now very hot, I halted
my troop, and despatched a note to Lieutenant Colonel
Turner, C.B., reporting the position of
the enemy and the very difficult nature of the
ground for cavalry to act upon, being a succession
of muddy rice khets, intersected by water-courses.

The enemy observing us stationary, and
seeing no infantry or guns advancing in support,
became bold, threw out skirmishers, and emerging
from their cover drew up in line, their right resting
on Suhejnee, and their left on the village of
Russowlee [Rasauli]. At this moment the rebel force must
have mustered from 900 to 1000 strong in infantry,
with 50 cavalry.

The enemy advanced. Without exchanging
a shot I at once retired slowly, followed up steadily
by the rebel line for a hundred yards clear of village
or jungle, when suddenly wheeling about my
divisions into line with a hearty cheer, we charged
into and through the centre of the enemy&#x27;s line,
Lieutenant Broughton with his detachment immediately
following up the movement, with excellent
effect from his position upon the enemy&#x27;s
left. The rebel right wing, of about 300 men,
broke at once, but the centre and left, observing
the great labour of the horses in crossing the
heavy ground, stood, and, receiving the charge with
repeated volleys, were cut down or broke only a
few yards ahead of the cavalry. From this moment
the pursuit was limited to the strongest and
best horses of the force, numbering some 60 of
all ranks, who, dashing into and swimming a deep and wide nullah, followed the flying enemy
through the village of Russowlee and its sugarcane
khets, over two miles of swamp, and five
hundred yards into the thick jungles near Peroo,
when, both men and horses being completely exhausted,
I sounded the halt and assembly, and,
collecting my wounded returned to Camp at Munjhaen
about 6 P.M. &quot;
====Further Information====
Only one man under Lt. Baker&#x27;s command was killed during this action and 17 wounded including George Bell Chicken, a civilian Master Mariner who was serving as a volunteer with the Naval Brigade.

When the report of Lt. Baker&#x27;s actions reached the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India (General Campbell) he directed his Adjutant-General to write the following to the Governor-General, Lord Canning:
&quot;I have the honour to request, on the part of his lordship, that you will have the goodness to direct the attention of the Right Honourable the Governor-General to the brilliancy of the exploit performed by Lieutenant G. C. Baker, of the Bengal Police Battalion, which is deserving of the highest encomium, on account both of conception and execution. His lordship is of opinion that the Victoria Cross should be awarded to Lieutenant Baker, and to Mr. Chicken, of the Indian Navy, and he will take immediate measures for the execution of his intention in this respect.&quot;
===Citation===
For his actions on that day Lieutenant Baker was awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation reads:

For gallant conduct on the occasion of an attack on the rebels at Suhejnee, near Peroo, on the 27th September, 1858

====Date of action====
In the despatch sent by Lieutenant Baker to his superiors, the action is stated as taking place on 26 September 1858. The date noted in reports from his commanders, and the date noted in the London Gazette however, is 27 September 1858. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.

===Later career===
After the Mutiny, Baker continued to serve with the Bengal Military Police Battalion, and took part in an 1861 Expedition to Sikkim. In 1863 he was appointed as Officiating Deputy Inspector-General of Military Police for the Dacca Circle of Bengal.

After leaving India, he served in the forces of Sultan Abdul Hamid II under Valentine Baker in the Balkan theatre during the Russo-Turkish War, and was taken prisoner by the Russians. As a reward from the Sultan for his service in Turkey, Baker was given the rank of Major General and appointed Lewa Pasha. Baker then went with Valentine Baker to Egypt, working under him and eventually succeeding him as head of the Egyptian police force. He went on to become Chief of the Public Security Department of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, holding that post until his retirement in 1895.

==Retirement==

After retiring from service with the Egyptian government, Major General Baker moved to Southbourne with his wife Charlotte, residing in the South Cliff Hotel on Belle Vue Road. He died on 19 February 1906 in Southbourne, and was laid to rest in Christchurch Cemetery in Dorset.

<text>Oklahoma State University–Tulsa, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States, is the newest institution of the Oklahoma State University System. It was previously the University Center at Tulsa until it became OSU-Tulsa on January 1, 1999. OSU-Tulsa is unique in the fact that it is not recognized as its own entity, but rather an extension of the main Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. OSU-Tulsa works in conjunction with the main OSU campus and Tulsa Community College to provide freshman and sophomore-level courses, enabling students to complete a four-year undergraduate course of study. Pamela Martin Fry was named the institution&#x27;s third president and first female president in 2019.

==Academics==

The Tulsa campus focuses on junior, senior and graduate level education, providing opportunities for individuals to complete bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

==Campus==

The campus is located north of downtown Tulsa, in the historic Greenwood neighborhood. Tulsa facilities include traditional classrooms, distance-learning classrooms, computer labs, and a conference center area.

The Helmerich Advanced Technology Research Center (HATRC) is a recent campus addition. This engineering building is home to OSU&#x27;s School of Materials Science and Engineering and has specialized labs for developing advanced materials targeted to local aerospace, biotechnology, and telecommunications, and manufacturing industries.

<text>Valentine Bambrick VC (13 April 1837 – 1 April 1864) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Bambrick was &quot;a son of the Army&quot; - his father, at least one uncle (after whom he was named), and his older brother John all served with the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own).

==Early life==
He was the son of John Thomas (1790–1879) and Harriett Ann Bambrick (1795–1871), &quot;née&quot; Redlan. His older brother Private John Thomas Bambrick (1832–1893) fought with the 11th Hussars (PAO) during the famous Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854 during the Crimean War. In 1853 Valentine Bambrick joined the 60th Rifles at the age of 16. He was 21 years old and a private in the 1st Battalion, 60th Rifles (later The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps), during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 6 May 1858 at Bareilly, India. He and his company commander Lieutenant Cromer Ashburnham (1831–1917) were cornered and Bambrick was awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts, recorded in the &quot;London Gazette as&quot;:
This short citation gives little idea of the desperate hand-to-hand fighting Bambrick would have been involved in in the narrow streets and alleys of Bareilly.

== End of military career ==
Bambrick was jailed in May 1859 - possibly for insubordination - and then again in July and November of the same year. When the 1st Battalion returned to the United Kingdom in 1860, it did so without Bambrick, who may have been serving a further sentence in a military jail. He transferred to the 87th Regiment, which by 1862 was stationed at Curragh Camp in Ireland. In July 1862 Bambrick was back in jail and in March 1863 he received a sentence of 160 days for desertion. It seems likely that Bambrick had a problem with alcohol. He had arrived at Aldershot in November 1863, just prior to being discharged from the Army and within 24 hours found himself in trouble again - this time with the civilian authorities.

==Incident at Aldershot==

On 12 December 1863 Bambrick appeared at the Winchester Assizes before Mr. Justice Baron Pigott. There he and Charlotte Johnson were indicted for violently assaulting Henry Milner Russell (1828–1894), and stealing from his person four medals in Aldershot on 15 November 1863. Russell had married Eliza Avery in 1861 and had been in camp at Aldershot since at least the same year.

Bambrick&#x27;s version of the incident was that he had been passing the lodging-house in Pickford Street where Russell resided and had gone to the assistance of a prostitute calling &quot;Murder!&quot; who was being attacked by Lance-Corporal Henry Russell of the Commissariat Department. Russell was unable to fend off the stronger Bambrick, and during the ensuing struggle Russell&#x27;s medals fell from his breast. Bambrick claimed that after the fight he had picked these medals up and placed them on a mantlepiece, from where they disappeared. Bambrick stated he had no interest in Russell&#x27;s medals as he himself had the Victoria Cross and the pension that went with it.

However, the court accepted Russell&#x27;s version of events.

Mr H. T. Cole prosecuted. It appeared that the prisoners were standing at the door of a lodging house in Pickford Street, Aldershot, at night, on November 15. Russell, who was lance-corporal in the commissariat department, came up. Bambrick asked Russell to drink, and he took some beer out of his pint. They then went into Russell&#x27;s room, who lodged in the house, and Russell said he would stand some beer, and he was in the act of giving the female prisoner some money to get the beer when Bambrick seized him by the throat, threw him on the bed, and tore from his breast four silver medals, one for the Punjab, one for the Sutlej, and one for the Crimea.

Russell called &quot;Murder,&quot; and his cries were heard by some of the other soldiers, who rushed in and took Bambrick from off Russell, and he was conveyed to the guardhouse. Two of the medals were afterwards found in the passage, Russell was insensible, having been nearly choked. Bambrick made a long address to the jury. He stated that he had been in the service 10 years, and would have been discharged the day after the occurrence.

He had a pension of £10 a year, and, what was dearer to a soldier than any other medal, a Victoria Cross, but he would tell the jury the real facts.

On that night, as he was walking with the female prisoner towards this house, in which she also lodged, he heard cries of &quot;Murder.&quot; He ran into the house and saw a girl named Hayley coming out of Russell&#x27;s room. She was crying, and said that Russell had beaten her and nearly strangled her. He went into the room and struck Russell, and they had a struggle together, and then the soldiers came in and took him up. These facts he could have proved on the first day of the assizes, because then Hayley was in Winchester, but as she was what was called an &quot;unfortunate,&quot; she could not afford to remain in Winchester.

The jury found the prisoner guilty. The judge said he should defer passing sentence until the morning. Bambrick replied, &quot;it is of no consequence what you do now. I don&#x27;t care about losing my pension; but I have lost my position. I don&#x27;t care what you do with me. You may hang me if you like&quot;.

This morning his lordship passed sentence. He said:

Valentine Bambrick, I don&#x27;t know that I ever had a more painful duty than in considering your case. I have felt great anxiety about it, and have considered everything you urged in your defence; but the evidence which satisfied the jury has satisfied me, and it does appear to me to be as clear a case as ever was tried. You say you had a witness, and that witness might have put some other construction on the matter. If you had made an application to have your trial postponed, I should have been the first to listen to your application, and I can&#x27;t help thinking, from the intelligence you displayed, you must have been aware that you could have made such an application. I am bound to say that I don&#x27;t think any witness could have altered the facts. You were found in a deadly struggle with another man. He was under you, and witness said that when he found you Russell was almost choked and suffocated by the pressure of your hand on his throat. It is perfectly clear he was robbed of his medals, and of them were found at the house where the woman lodged. How could they have come there? How did they come from the breast of Russell? I have no doubt you have exhibited great gallantry and great courage, and have well entitled yourself to the Victoria Cross. Had it not been for your character, I should have put in force the provisions of a recent statute and subjected you to personal castigation, but, as it, is I deal with your case with great regret. I should have been delighted if the jury could have seen their way to a doubt. I believe that you must have been under the influence of drink, for there was no adequate motive for your act, for the medals are only of trifling value.

Your punishment must be very severe. It must be penal servitude for three years.

With regard to you, Charlotte Johnson, you took a very subordinate part in the affair.

Bambrick, holding up the girl&#x27;s hand, said, &quot;Look at this small hand, my lord; it is absurd to suppose she could have done much against a strong man. She was merely in the room.&quot;

The judge replied, &quot;l say she only took a subordinate part. I shall not punish her so severely as the male prisoner. She must be imprisoned, with hard labour, for 12 months&quot;.

Bambrick then shouted, &quot;There won&#x27;t be a bigger robber in England than I shall be when I come out&quot;.
In reality, Russell&#x27;s account of what had happened in Aldershot seems unlikely; his pride had probably been hurt at being soundly beaten by Bambrick and as a married man he would not have been keen to explain either to his wife or his commanding officer that he had lost his medals while beating a prostitute in his room. However, Bambrick did not endear himself to the court because of his confrontational manner, and despite Russell being the only witness for the prosecution Bambrick and Johnson were found guilty.

==Suicide==
The &quot;Aldershot Military Gazette&quot; of 26 September 1863 recorded that:

On Thursday a most determined attempt of suicide was made by a soldier named Valentine Bambrick, of the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers, who, for some acts of gallantry was decorated with a Victoria Cross. It appears that in the course of the previous night (Wednesday), Bambrick was observed with a female in his room; was immediately apprehended, and conveyed to the guard-room. At about twelve o&#x27;clock the prisoner was being removed for the purpose of being brought before the commanding-officer, when seeing razor lying conveniently picked it up, and without the slightest hesitation drew it across his throat, inflicting a fearful gash. He then as rapidly drew the instrument down both sides of his chest, inflicting dangerous wounds. At this time the razor was wrested from him, and medical aid was at once summoned. Bambrick is now, we understand, doing as well as could be expected, and is likely to recover. The female, who was perhaps the cause of his committing the rash act, came with him from Ireland, and appears (as does the unfortunate fellow himself) very anxious for an interview. However, there is a strict guard kept over him, and as it is necessary that he should be kept extremely quiet, it is not probable she will have her liberty granted her, at present, at all events.
Valentine Bambrick had his Victoria Cross forfeited by Royal Warrant on 3 December 1863. He was one of eight men who had their Victoria Cross forfeited, between 1856 and 1908, for various crimes. However, King George V felt that no Victoria Cross should ever be forfeited, regardless of crime. Bambrick and the other seven men whose awards were forfeited are officially listed as Victoria Cross holders.
Valentine Bambrick committed suicide by hanging, using his pocket handkerchief from the handle of the ventilator behind the cell door in Pentonville Prison, London on 1 April 1864.

Melancholy Suicide in Pentonville Prison

An inquiry of a melancholy character was instituted by Dr. Lankester on Tuesday evening at the Pentonville Model Prison, relative to the death of a prisoner, Valentine Bambrick aged twenty-eight years (sic), who was found dead and hanging in his cell on Friday evening last. Last week a similar inquest was held. Mr Charles Lawrence Bradley, medical officer of the prison, said he had been told that he (prisoner) fretted, as he was being unjustly punished for a crime of which be was not guilty. His mind was no doubt impaired, and he had suffered from delirium tremens. A letter was written on
slate by deceased which might be worth the attention of the jury He left a last letter, written, apparently, on slate, to his family.
Bambrick&#x27;s last letter read:

My dear, dear Friends and Family, - Becoming quite tired of my truly miserable existence, I am about to rush into the presence of my Maker uncalled unasked. To you I appeal for forgiveness and pardon for all the unhappiness I have ever caused you. I dare not ask for mercy of God. I am doing that which admits of no pardon, but if He will hear my prayer. I pray to Him to grant you consolation in your hour of affliction, for I know that, notwithstanding all my faults, that love which you always manifested towards me is not withheld yet, and therefore the news of my unfortunate fate will make time sorrowful. Pray for your unfortunate son.

&quot;VAL BAMBRICK.&quot;

P.S.-Before I die I protest solemnly my entire innocence of the charge for which I was punished, all but the assault, and that was done under the circumstances before mentioned to you in my letter. God bless you all Love to all my relations. Pity even while you condemn. Poor Val.
Bambrick was buried in an unmarked grave in St Pancras and Islington Cemetery which could not be located, but a memorial plaque to him was placed in 2002. The location of his Victoria Cross is unknown.

It is located in Little Rock, Arkansas and includes the Clinton Presidential Library, the offices of the Clinton Foundation, and the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service. It is the thirteenth presidential library to have been completed in the United States, the eleventh to be operated by the National Archives and Records Administration, and the third to comply with the Presidential Records Act of 1978.

It is situated on of land located next to the Arkansas River and Interstate 30 and was designed by architectural firm Polshek Partnership, LLP with exhibition design by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. Polk Stanley Wilcox Architects also contributed. The main building cantilevers over the Arkansas River, echoing Clinton&#x27;s campaign promise of &quot;building a bridge to the 21st century&quot;. With a floor plan, the library itself is the largest presidential library in terms of physical area, although the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library has the greatest space overall, due to its addition of the Air Force One Pavilion in 2005. The archives are the largest as well, containing 2 million photographs, 80 million pages of documents, 21 million e-mail messages, and 79,000 artifacts from the Clinton presidency. The Clinton Library is also the most expensive, with all funding coming from 112,000 private donations.

The museum showcases artifacts from Clinton&#x27;s two terms as president and includes full-scale replicas of the Clinton-era Oval Office and Cabinet Room.

==History==
Preliminary planning for the library (including the site choice) began in 1997, while groundbreaking for the complex occurred on December 5, 2001. Early estimates put the library&#x27;s cost at about $125 million. In 2001, the Clinton Foundation hoped to gather $200 million in donations to cover project costs. In the end, the entire project cost $165 million in private funding, with an additional $11.5 million of land given by the City of Little Rock to construct and covers within a park.

Fund-raising for the center was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton&#x27;s who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations for the center, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, all of which were tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.

===Dedication ceremony===

The Clinton Presidential Center was dedicated on November 18, 2004. Although it was raining, the ceremony was attended by approximately 30,000 people (including notable figures such as Willie Mays, Robin Williams, and Barbra Streisand) and included a 20-minute speech made by Clinton, who had recently undergone bypass surgery. It also included performances by Bono, the African Drum Ballet and the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir, as well as an invocation given by Floyd Flake and video tribute from Nelson Mandela. Four U.S. presidents (Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush were present; former president Gerald R. Ford could not attend due to health concerns) were on the same stage together. All three other presidents spoke at the event as well. Overall, the ceremony lasted two hours and featured six speakers.

===Fifth anniversary===
On November 17, 2009, the library&#x27;s fifth anniversary saw Clinton giving a speech to approximately 1,000 people, urging the passage of health-care reform and the reduction of energy use. He specifically mentioned the center and school as places where discussion on such topics could take place.

==Complex==

===Main building===

The five-story main building comprises of exhibition space, the Great Hall (used for banquets or forums), Forty Two (formerly Café 42, now a full-service restaurant; Clinton was the 42nd president), and classrooms. A private penthouse used by Clinton is located on the top (fifth) floor of the main building, one level above the public museum area. In 2007 the Clinton Foundation installed on the rooftop of the Presidential library the private &quot;Rooftop Garden&quot; with a golf course.

The organization of the exhibits within the main building was inspired by the famous Long Room in the Old Library at Trinity College, Dublin, which Clinton first saw when he was a Rhodes Scholar. The Cadillac One used during Clinton&#x27;s presidency is housed on the first floor. On the second floor, the main gallery houses a timeline, representing each of Clinton&#x27;s years as president. There is also an 80-seat theater, the Great Hall, and the replicas of the Oval Office and Cabinet Room. The restaurant is located in the basement.

===Archives===

Between November 18, 2000 and January 27, 2001, eight Lockheed C-5 Galaxy missions moved 602 tonnes (664 short tons) of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s papers, gifts, artifacts, and other official materials from Andrews Air Force Base to Little Rock Air Force Base. Commercial trucks transported the cargoes from the base to the National Archives storage facility in Little Rock, where they were to remain until completion of the Clinton presidential library in 2004.

The archives are housed in a building south of and connected to the main building, which also contains NARA facilities. The Clinton archives are the first to include electronic information along with physical documents. The total amount of records is , the most of any presidential archive. Because Clinton wanted a light-filled library, the archives are kept underground to protect them from damage from ultraviolet degradation.

===Clinton Presidential Park===
The Clinton Presidential Park occupies nearly of land and is located on the riverfront next to the museum. It is a leading example of urban renewal, as the site was formerly a run-down warehouse district. The park was built next to the site of abandoned railroad tracks of the defunct Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The center of the park is Celebration Circle, a fountain plaza around which the center&#x27;s major buildings are located. It also includes an arboretum, amphitheater, gardens, and a children&#x27;s play area. There is also an area where Clinton could be buried if he chooses.

===Choctaw Station===

Choctaw Station is a restored historic redbrick train station opened by the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad in 1901 and used by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad until passenger service was discontinued in November 1967. The building was subsequently purchased by the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; (known now as &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;) and later restored by a restaurant chain, Spaghetti Warehouse, which was known for preserving old buildings. The Choctaw Station now houses the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, the Clinton Public Policy Institute, and the Clinton Foundation. The station is after having been renovated. A companion structure, the 1899 Choctaw freight station, was razed in November 2001 after a contentious debate between the City of Little Rock and historic preservationists.

===Bridge===

The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge across the Arkansas River, originally built by the Choctaw and Memphis Railroad and leading to Choctaw Station, has been converted into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of the library&#x27;s opening, Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state. In 2009, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010. On September 30, 2011, Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge, which opened to the public on October 2, 2011.

===Store===
For legal reasons involving state development funds, retail facilities were, for a time, prohibited on the same property as the library itself. The Clinton Museum Store was first located in the nearby River Market district. In 2016, however, the limitation expired and the store relocated to the library lobby.
==Exhibits==


The Clinton Library features numerous items from Clinton&#x27;s time as president. Clinton&#x27;s Cadillac One is on the first floor of the main building. The second floor includes the main gallery. It consists of a timeline of each of Clinton&#x27;s years as president, as well as 14 alcoves featuring various events during Clinton&#x27;s terms. There is an orientation theater and full-size replicas of the Clinton-era Oval Office and Cabinet Room as well. The Oval Office exhibit is the only full-size model Oval Office in any presidential library, and was constructed using thousands of photos taken by White House officials of the original office.

The timeline comprises eight panels, each one wide and begins with Clinton&#x27;s 1993 inaugural address. Items on the alcove displays include the Oklahoma City bombing and Northern Ireland and Middle East peace efforts. Items released by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 are included in the exhibits, including personal letters written to and by the Clinton family, such as ones from Whoopi Goldberg and Arsenio Hall, as well as family photographs and even a Valentine&#x27;s Day note from Bill Clinton to Hillary. The second floor of the main gallery showcases artifacts from previous state dinners and various state gifts, such as ceramics and other decorative pieces. An exhibit on Clinton&#x27;s saxophone and another on family pets Socks and Buddy are also on the second floor.

Clinton has been criticized for not including enough details about the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his impeachment. One of the 14 alcoves is dedicated to the &quot;politics of persecution&quot; and is titled &quot;The Fight For Power&quot;. The alcove includes the Lewinsky affair, the Whitewater scandal, and the Republican Contract with America. Ralph Applebaum, the chief exhibit designer for the center, said that Clinton was heavily involved in the alcove&#x27;s design, and that Clinton &quot;insisted on a transparent and illuminating exhibition&quot;. The scandal is portrayed as a power struggle between Republicans in Congress and Clinton after the Republican Party took control of both the House of Representatives and Senate in 1994.

==Controversies and criticism==

In 1997, Eugene Pfeifer III sued the city of Little Rock to challenge its use of eminent domain in the use of the land but the city&#x27;s method of taking the land was upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 2001. Pfeifer argued against the use of revenue bonds for the project because he believed that the city could not afford to repay them. In 2001, a rail depot dating from 1899 was discovered within a warehouse on the site. Preservationists lost a court battle to save the building, and the depot was destroyed. Protesters also picketed the city hall when the city tried to name the street in front of the library &quot;President Clinton Avenue&quot;. The two groups later compromised and only half of the street was renamed.

The library has been criticized for not including much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich&#x27;s wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton&#x27;s presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich&#x27;s bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich&#x27;s appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Clinton has also been criticized for the library&#x27;s lack of coverage regarding various scandals during his presidency, including the Whitewater scandal. Clinton adviser Bruce Lindsey said that Clinton wanted to provide information regarding the incidents, but depicting the attacks as a scheme to &quot;delegitimize&quot; Clinton&#x27;s administration. The museum&#x27;s main exhibit designer has said that &quot;this is the way the president wanted to see his legacy defined.&quot;

==Design==

===General design===

The primarily modernist complex was designed by James Polshek&#x27;s Polshek Partnership Architects, led by Polshek and partner Richard Olcott. The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates. The museum and exhibitions were designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, with landscaping by Hargreaves associates. Clinton did not announce his choice of architect until 1999, when Polshek was officially hired that August. Although Appelbaum was the official designer for the exhibitions, Appelbaum called Clinton &quot;the editor-in-chief, the curator-in-chief and in many times the art director of the exhibits&quot;.

It is constructed primarily of steel and glass. The main building is based on the diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside is constructed of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.

===Environment===
The library incorporates many aspects of environmentally-sensitive design, in accordance to Clinton&#x27;s work involving sustainable development. It first earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification under the United States Green Building Council LEED for New Construction program in 2004 and later Platinum Certification under LEED-EB (LEED for Existing Buildings) in 2007. The library&#x27;s flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there are charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, a rooftop garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels. The garden collects runoff and is maintained without the use of gasoline-powered lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.

==Economic impact==
After the location for the project was announced, many new businesses began to develop in the surrounding area. Numerous hotels, restaurants, housing complexes, offices, retail stores were established. The revived River Market district, a dining and retail area near the library, was created as a result of its location. In addition, over $1 billion of new real estate has been invested in downtown Little Rock. The world headquarters of Heifer International is located just beyond the library.

The center has spurred an estimated $2 billion in new projects in the surrounding parts of Little Rock. Since its opening, the library has had over 1.64 million visitors. The museum had 302,583 visitors in 2009 and 273,108 visitors in 2008. There were approximately 500,000 visitors during its first year (November 2004 – 2005).

===Student outreach===
The Clinton Presidential Center offers free admission to school groups, homeschool groups, and other school personnel with a reservation.

The center also offers four free-admission days annually in celebration of Presidents&#x27; Day, the Fourth of July, President Clinton&#x27;s birthday, and the anniversary of the Clinton Center&#x27;s grand opening.

<text>Sir Percy James Grigg, KCB, KCSI, PC (16 December 18905 May 1964), often referred to as P J Grigg and later better known as Sir James Grigg, was a British civil servant who was unexpectedly moved, at the behest of then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill, from being the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the War Office to become Secretary of State for War, the political head of the same department during the Second World War.

==Background and education==
The son of Frank Alfred Grigg, a carpenter, James Grigg was born in Exmouth and won a scholarship to Bournemouth School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge where he studied mathematics, achieving first-class honours in both parts of his tripos.

==Career in civil service==
Grigg came first in the civil service examination in 1913, and commenced work at the Treasury. During and after the First World War he served successive Chancellors including Winston Churchill. Grigg then became Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise and Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. In 1934, he was transferred to New Delhi, India where he became Finance Member of the Government of India in anticipation of limited self-rule that began in 1935. He remained in New Delhi until 1939, and afterward continued to influence British imperial policies on India, especially after his patron Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. Grigg became Permanent Under-Secretary of State for War in 1939; he oversaw a turbulent department, which in 1940 witnessed no fewer than four different Secretaries of State for War (Leslie Hore-Belisha, Oliver Stanley, Anthony Eden and David Margesson).

==Secretary of State for War==
Grigg proved an effective departmental head, but it came as a great shock to many when in February 1942 Churchill dismissed Margesson and replaced him with Grigg – who had to convey the news to Margesson himself. Amongst the many Ministerial appointments made by Churchill from outside the sphere of Westminster politics, this was seen as one of the most unusual, but was a response to considerable military setbacks such as the fall of Singapore, and the need to appease critics by replacing some ministers. Grigg retained his post for the rest of the war, holding it also in Churchill&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Caretaker Government&quot;. In 1942 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiff East, beating Fenner Brockway. Alan Brooke the wartime Army CIGS said that with &quot;PJ&quot; he had the &quot;best and most valuable advice on any matter I discussed with him&quot; (unlike Lawson, who replaced Grigg). 

But in the 1945 general election Grigg lost his seat, and retired from public life.

==Later life==
In his later years Grigg held many directorships, including those of the Imperial Tobacco Company, the Prudential Assurance Company, the National Provincial Bank and the Distillers Company. In 1946, he became the first British executive director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He died on 5 May 1964, aged 73.

==Family==
He married Gertrude Charlotte Hough, daughter of the Reverend George Frederick Hough, in July 1919. The marriage was childless.

<text>Fremantle Limited (), formerly FremantleMedia, is a British multinational television production and distribution company based in London. The company was founded as Pearson Television in 1993 when publishing and education company Pearson acquired the former British ITV franchisee Thames Television. Fremantle takes its name from Fremantle International, which was acquired by predecessor company All American Television in 1994. Pearson Television and Bertelsmann&#x27;s CLT-UFA merged in 2000 to form the RTL Group, with Pearson Television itself being renamed FremantleMedia on 20 August of the following year.

Fremantle owns non-scripted formats, including the British talent shows &quot;Idols&quot;, &quot;Got Talent&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;; all of which have been sold globally. Since 1994, Fremantle has distributed American game shows locally in the United States and globally.

==History==

===Pearson Television (1993–2001)===
On 23 April 1993, Pearson plc bought Thames Television, which had been one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; franchisees in the ITV network from 1968 to 1992, and, as an independent production company, was continuing to produce many shows for ITV and other broadcasters. Thames became the first division of Pearson Television, and Pearson gained the rights to Thames programmes like &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;.

Then in 1995 it acquired Australian production company Grundy Television. Allied Communications Inc. (ACI), a American-based distributor of made-for-television films, was purchased later that year for $40 million.

In January 1996, Pearson Television acquired the British production company SelecTV plc, and merged into it.

Pearson Television announced on 1 October 1997 that it would launch a $373 million cash tender offer for publicly traded American television company All American Communications Inc. On 5 November, Pearson completed its tender offer, and All American was merged into Pearson Television the following year. This acquisition gave Pearson worldwide rights to various game show formats as well as drama series in the United States such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, while All American Music Group was sold to Zomba Records subsidiary Volcano Entertainment.

Pearson Television acquired Italian drama production company Mastrofilm on 3 November 1998, and European animation financer and distributor EVA Entertainment on 2 February 1999.

In June 2000, Pearson Television had announced their decision to take over Smith &amp; Jones&#x27; British production company Talkback Productions.

All American acquired Fremantle International in August. Paul Talbot continued to own The Fremantle Corporation, the international distributor of All American&#x27;s &quot;Baywatch&quot; and other programs until his death in 2005, and the company&#x27;s assets were later acquired by Canadian-based Kaleidoscope Entertainment in June 2006. All American Fremantle International managed and distributed Mark Goodson Productions&#x27; game show formats worldwide.

<text>The Ocala Street and Suburban Railroad Company was incorporated on July 21, 1888 under the general incorporation laws of Florida. They were granted the exclusive right to operate a street railroad in Ocala, Florida by a town ordinance passed September 18, 1889.

Florida state law chapter 4268, approved June 1, 1893, verified the incorporation of the Ocala Street and Suburban Railroad Company, since there was some doubt as to whether it was strictly following the laws relating to the incorporation of railroad companies. At the time, about 3.5 miles of track had been built. The company was given the right &quot;to construct, maintain and operate a line of railroad from the city of Ocala to Silver Springs, in said county, and from Silver Springs to Silver Springs Park, in said county, and through the streets of said towns of Silver Springs and Silver Springs Park, under such restrictions as may be made by law; and to operate the same by horse power, steam, cable, or electricity, as it may deem the most convenient.&quot;

Tracks were laid on Main Street and Magnolia Avenue for mule-drawn cars, and were removed before 1900.

<doc id="1180447" wikidata="Q5034401" url="?curid=1180447" title="Cap'n O. G. Readmore">
<text>Cap&#x27;n O. G. Readmore (invented by Puppet Studio) was the fictional character host of the American television anthology series &quot;ABC Weekend Specials&quot; during the 1980s. He was an anthropomorphic cat puppet, dressed in a nautical outfit, that encouraged children to read for pleasure. He hosted the show from 1984 through 1989, performing with guest stars including Vincent Price, Harry Blackstone Jr., Pat Morita, Joan Lunden and others.

The character also appeared in animated form in a series of &quot;ABC Weekend Specials&quot;, including &quot;Cap’n O. G. Readmore&#x27;s Puss in Boots&quot; and &quot;Cap&#x27;n O. G. Readmore Meets Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. In these features, he was the president of an all-feline book club, the Friday Night Book Club, who often found himself physically pulled into the story he&#x27;s reading.

==Plot==
The voice of the character was provided by the American voice actor Frank Welker in the original public service announcements and while hosting the &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot;. However, in several of the animated specials, such as &quot;Cap&#x27;n O. G. Readmore Meets Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, his voice was provided by Neil Ross. Many of the regular characters had fanciful names such as Lickety Page (voiced by Lucille Bliss) who is the youngest of the Book Club, Kitty Literature (voiced by Ilene Latter) who is the only female member of the Book Club, Wordsy (voiced by Stan Jones), who is the most gentlemanly of the Book Club, and Ol&#x27; Tome Cat (voiced by Stanley Jones) who is the oldest and wisest of the Book Club.

Other side characters include a Madam Mim-inspired witch named Calypso La Rose (voiced by Lucille Bliss) and a Count Chocula-inspired vampire named Vitack (voiced by Hal Smith) who runs an organization called the Villains Agency. Production was by ABC Entertainment in association with Rick Reinert Pictures of Burbank, California. All these specials were directed and produced by legendary animator Rick Reinert (&quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot;).

==List of shorts==
==Home media==
Four of the &quot;Cap&#x27;n O. G. Readmore&quot; episodes were made available on Beacon Home Video in 1990; these copies are very rare and hard to find. The &quot;Chicken Little&quot; episode, made in 1992, has seen no official release on any video formats in North America. ABC Home Video released the first three episodes in 1993, which were all out-of-print since. The &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; episode was released on VHS by Anchor Bay Home Entertainment in 1998 and is also out-of-print. As of 2020, there are currently no plans for any of the &quot;Readmore&quot; episodes to be distributed on DVD, but all of the episodes surfaced on DVD in South Korea.

==Inspiration==
The feline character Cap&#x27;n Readmore was drawn on as a source of inspiration when choosing a middle name for Dewey Readmore Books.

<text>The DP-64 Nepryadva is a Russian special-purpose double-barreled over/under grenade launcher designed to protect surfaced submarines, ships, dockyards, water development works, and other coastal installations from combat swimmers and naval special forces. The weapon is breech-loading and operates much like a large shotgun with a side-break breech, utilizing both direct and indirect iron sights. The weapon is capable of firing grenades indirectly at ranges up to ; however, these grenades act much like small depth charges, attacking submerged swimmers like true depth charges attack submersibles. A large polymer stock and the barrels themselves makes up the bulk of the weapon. The barrels are selected by turning a lever accommodated above the trigger guard. A front pistol grip is equipped for support and is out of alignment with the rear grip and trigger mechanism, providing a more natural grip while firing indirectly. The butt is fitted with a springy rubber pad to diminish felt recoil. Direct fire sights are also provided for use from a helicopter allowing for large areas to be patrolled and protected from enemy combat swimmers. The grenade launcher was developed in 1989 and introduced in 1990.

The DP-64 grenade launcher is now in serial production, said Pavel Sidorov, a representative of NPO Bazalt, the designer of the DP-64, at the 2015 International Defense Exhibition (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. Sidorov said that the company received a large order from Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry for the weapons. Previously, the DP-64 has only been built in small numbers for the Russian coast guard, Federal Security Service, and a handful of marine units.

Though large and somewhat unwieldy, the DP-64 serves an important role with few modern contemporaries in the small arms world.

<doc id="1180461" wikidata="Q7622661" url="?curid=1180461" title="Stream cipher attacks">
<text>Stream ciphers, where plaintext bits are combined with a cipher bit stream by an exclusive-or operation (xor), can be very secure if used properly. However, they are vulnerable to attacks if certain precautions are not followed:

*keys must never be used twice
*valid decryption should never be relied on to indicate authenticity

==Reused key attack==
Stream ciphers are vulnerable to attack if the same key is used twice (depth of two) or more.

Say we send messages &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of the same length, both encrypted using same key, &quot;K&quot;. The stream cipher produces a string of bits &quot;C(K)&quot; the same length as the messages. The encrypted versions of the messages then are:

:&quot;E(A) = A xor C&quot;
:&quot;E(B) = B xor C&quot;

where &quot;xor&quot; is performed bit by bit.

Say an adversary has intercepted &quot;E(A)&quot; and &quot;E(B)&quot;. They can easily compute:

:&quot;E(A) xor E(B)&quot;

However, &quot;xor&quot; is commutative and has the property that &quot;X xor X = 0&quot; (self-inverse) so:
:&quot;E(A) xor E(B) = (A xor C) xor (B xor C) = A xor B xor C xor C = A xor B&quot;

If one message is longer than the other, our adversary just truncates the longer message to the size of the shorter and their attack will only reveal that portion of the longer message. In other words, if anyone intercepts two messages encrypted with the same key, they can recover &quot;A xor B&quot;, which is a form of running key cipher. Even if neither message is known, as long as both messages are in a natural language, such a cipher can often be broken by paper-and-pencil methods. During World War II, British cryptanalyst John Tiltman accomplished this with the Lorenz cipher (dubbed &quot;Tunny&quot;). With an average personal computer, such ciphers can usually be broken in a matter of minutes. If one message is known, the solution is trivial.

Another situation where recovery is trivial is if traffic-flow security measures have each station sending a continuous stream of cipher bits, with null characters (e.g. &quot;LTRS&quot; in Baudot) being sent when there is no real traffic. This is common in military communications. In that case, and if the transmission channel is not fully loaded, there is a good likelihood that one of the ciphertext streams will be just nulls. The NSA goes to great lengths to prevent keys from being used twice. 1960s-era encryption systems often included a punched card reader for loading keys. The mechanism would automatically cut the card in half when the card was removed, preventing its reuse.

One way to avoid this problem is to use an initialization vector (IV), sent in the clear, that is combined with a secret master key to create a one-time key for the stream cipher. This is done in several common systems that use the popular stream cipher RC4, including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Ciphersaber. One of the many problems with WEP was that its IV was too short, 24 bits. This meant that there was a high likelihood that the same IV would be used twice if more than a few thousand packets were sent with the same master key (see birthday attack), subjecting the packets with duplicated IV to the key reuse attack. This problem was fixed in WPA by changing the &quot;master&quot; key frequently.

==Bit-flipping attack==
Suppose an adversary knows the exact content of all or part of one of our messages. As a part of a man in the middle attack or replay attack, they can alter the content of the message without knowing the key, &quot;K&quot;. Say, for example, they know a portion of the message, say an electronics fund transfer, contains the ASCII string &quot;$1000.00&quot;. They can change that to &quot;$9500.00&quot; by XORing that portion of the ciphertext with the string: &quot;&quot;$1000.00&quot; xor &quot;$9500.00&quot;&quot;. To see how this works, consider that the cipher text we send is just &quot;C(K) xor &quot;$1000.00&quot;&quot;. The new message the adversary is creating is:

:&quot;(C(K) xor &quot;$1000.00&quot;) xor (&quot;$1000.00&quot; xor &quot;$9500.00&quot;) = C(K) xor &quot;$1000.00&quot; xor &quot;$1000.00&quot; xor &quot;$9500.00&quot; = C(K) xor &quot;$9500.00&quot;&quot;

Recall that a string XORed with itself produces all zeros and that a string of zeros XORed with another string leaves that string intact. The result, C(K) xor &quot;$9500.00&quot;, is what our ciphertext would have been if $9500 were the correct amount.

Bit-flipping attacks can be prevented by including message authentication code to increase the likelihood that tampering will be detected.

==Chosen-IV attack==
Stream ciphers combine a secret key with an agreed initialization vector (IV) to produce a pseudo-random sequence which from time-to-time is re-synchronized. A &quot;Chosen IV&quot; attack relies on finding particular IV&#x27;s which taken together probably will reveal information about the secret key. Typically multiple pairs of IV are chosen and differences in generated key-streams are then analysed statistically for a linear correlation and/or an algebraic Boolean relation (see also Differential cryptanalysis). If choosing particular values of the initialization vector does expose a non-random pattern in the generated sequence, then this attack computes some bits and thus shortens the effective key length. A symptom of the attack would be frequent re-synchronisation. Modern stream ciphers include steps to adequately mix the secret key with an initialization vector, usually by performing many initial rounds.

<doc id="1180462" wikidata="Q1956078" url="?curid=1180462" title="War of the Remences">
<text>The Rebellion of the Remences or War of the Remences was a popular revolt in late medieval Europe against seignorial pressures that began in the Principality of Catalonia in 1462 and ended a decade later without definitive result.
Ferdinand II of Aragon finally resolved the conflict with the &quot;Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe&quot; in 1486.

The Catalan term &quot;remença&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;redementia&quot; and emphasizes the possibility of redemption from servitude.

In the early 14th century, the rise of Catalan cities and the expansion of Catalan culture and the Aragonese Empire led to a decline in the rural population, which declined still further due to the Black Death. The nobility began to strictly enforce the evil customs tying peasants to the land; they also began a much stricter enforcement of seignorial rights in general than had been the practice in recent centuries.

The strongest support for open rebellion came from the poorest peasants. Those with more goods—who were in the majority on the Plain of Vic, l&#x27;Empordà, and el Vallès—tried to appeal to the king for reforms and the end of the seignorial abuses. The monarchy had some reasons to wish to have the peasants as an independent force, since the Aragonese crown was continually in a power struggle with the nobility.

In the mid-15th century, Alfonso V of Aragon, &quot;the Magnanimous&quot;, allowed the peasants to form a &quot;sindicat remença&quot;, a peasants&#x27; guild or primitive trade union, granted them their liberty and intervened in several other ways against the abuses. However, the Bishop of Girona sided with the nobility; along with the Generalitat, controlled by the nobles, their opposition led Alfonso to reverse himself.

Alfonso&#x27;s successor, John II, sought the peasants&#x27; help against the nobility. By May 1461, the peasantry had declared themselves in favor of the king against the nobles.

==First War of the Remences==

In 1462, the remensa peasants rebelled; this coincided with the War against John II by the nobles. The peasants, under the leadership of Francesc de Verntallat, fought mainly in the mountainous interior, while the king and the more traditional armed forces loyal to him fought nearer the Mediterranean coast. After ten years, John won the war, but failed to abolish serfdom or even to bring about significant reforms.

==Second War of the Remences==

In 1484, a second rebellion broke out, under the leadership of Pere Joan Sala, the former captain of Francesc de Verntallat. It began with the Mieres Uprising, which took place in the Valley of Mieres on September 22, 1484.

Following that, Joan Sala was able to extend his power not only in the Muntanya Comarca, but also in the Plain of Vic, Selva, Garrotxa, and Gironès. He wasn&#x27;t as successful in Empordà, where the peasants didn&#x27;t follow him into revolt, nor on December 14 when he tried to take Girona. However, Lieutenant &quot;Infante&quot; Enric, who wanted to organize an attack against Joan Sala, had to retreat in the face of the size of his amassed forces.

In the face of this rebellion, King Ferdinand II, &quot;the Catholic&quot; issued the &quot;Sentencia de Guadalupe&quot; (1486), outlawing the more severe abuses and allowing remensa peasants to be redeemed by a payment of 60 sous per household, leaving a rural society that was still feudal in character, but significantly reformed.

GBU-16 bombs are produced by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. began production after purchasing the product line from Texas Instruments. Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract to compete with Raytheon when there was a break in production caused by transferring manufacturing out of Texas.

Raytheon production of the GBU-16 is centered in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s production is centered in Pennsylvania.

Laser-guided bombs are often labeled as &quot;smart bombs&quot; despite requiring external input in the form of laser designation of the intended target. According to Raytheon&#x27;s fact sheet for the PAVEWAY 2, 99 deliveries of guided munitions will yield a circular error probability (CEP) of only , versus for 99 unguided bombs dropped under similar conditions.

<text>The Prince&#x27;s Life Regiment () was a Royal Danish Army infantry regiment. The motto of the regiment was &quot;Gloria Finis&quot; (Honor above all).

==History==
Because one of the regiment&#x27;s antecedents was the life regiment of Queen Ingrid, the Queen Mother, the regiment had both Prince Henrik&#x27;s and the late Queen Mother&#x27;s cyphers on its Regimental Colour. The regiment was raised during the reign of King Frederik III in 1657 under the command of Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein. Over the years it underwent many changes of name, the last taking place in 1961.

The Regiment participated in the Northern Wars (1657–1660), Scanian War (1675–1679), Great Northern War (1709–1720), First Schleswig War (1848–1850) and Second Schleswig War (1864). It was furthermore in foreign service during 1689–1697 and 1701–1714. The regimental flag had the battle honours Nyborg 1659, Wismar 1675, Rygen 1715, Treldeskansen 1849, Dybbøl 1849 and Dybbøl 1864.

From the 1960s to 2000 the regiment had two mechanised and two infantry battalions, from 2000 to 2004 it had four mechanised and three infantry battalions.

In 2000, two other regiments, Schleswig Regiment of Foot and Queen&#x27;s Life Regiment, were merged into Prince&#x27;s Life Regiment. In August 2005, the regiment was amalgamated with Jutland Dragoon Regiment and its battalions were disbanded.

<doc id="1180476" wikidata="Q281359" url="?curid=1180476" title="Russborough House">
<text>Russborough House is a Georgian Palladian house between Blessington and Ballymore Eustace near the Blessington Lakes in County Wicklow, Ireland. The house was designed by Richard Castle for Joseph Leeson, 1st Earl of Milltown and built between 1741 and 1755. It has an exceptionally long frontage measuring . The interior contains fine ornate plasterwork on the ceilings by the Lafranchini brothers, who also collaborated with Castle on Carton House. Russborough contains an important private collection of European fine and decorative arts, including furniture, silver, porcelain and paintings many of which have now been transferred to galleries for safe keeping.

Russborough is open to visitors and is located on a estate, with many of the original 18th-century features still in place including the walled garden, ice-house, lime kiln and the serpentine lakes. There is also a restaurant, shop and maze.

==History==

=== Leeson family ownership ===
The Leeson family originated in the English county of Northamptonshire and had moved to Ireland in the second half of the 17th century. A sizeable fortune made in brewing and property development in Dublin passed down to Joseph Leeson, who bought land at what was then Russelltown. He became an MP and was made Earl of Milltown in 1763.

Russborough House was designed for Joseph Leeson by Richard Castle and built between 1741 and 1755. While the house was being built Joseph embarked on two Grand Tours to acquire a suitably impressive collection of paintings, sculpture and furnishings to adorn his new home. Back at Russborough, Ireland&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s finest artisans and craftspeople were appointed by Castle to create a lavish interior. It remained in the possession of the Earls of Milltown until the sixth earl. On the death of his widow in 1914 it passed to a nephew, Edmund Turton, who rarely stayed there. On Turton&#x27;s death in 1929, his widow sold the house to Captain Denis Bowes Daly in 1931.

Between 1937 and 1940, the Liffey valley in front of the house was flooded in order to create Poulaphouca Reservoir, also known as the Blessington Lakes.

=== Beit family ownership ===
Sir Alfred Beit bought Russborough in 1952 from Captain Daly to house his art collection and in 1976 established the Alfred Beit Foundation, a registered charity, to manage the property. Described as Ireland&#x27;s most beautiful Georgian house, the foundation opened the historic mansion and its collections to the Irish public in 1978. Beit died in 1994 and Lady Beit remained in residence until her own death in 2005.

On 7 February 2010, a fire severely damaged the west wing and caused part of the roof to collapse. No art was damaged, having been removed along with furniture to allow for restorations to the west wing. Initial examinations of the damage suggested an electrical fault from wiring in the roof may have sparked the fire.

==Architecture and gardens==
Russborough is a classical Palladian villa made up of a central block containing the principal rooms and two wings housing the servants and stable blocks to the east and west. Castle enhanced his core design with a wealth of features. The Greek orders are observed in the Doric columns of the colonnades and the Corinthian columns that flank the main entrance, supporting a fused portico enriched with swags of flowers. At the bottom of the flight of granite steps the visitor is greeted by a pair of heraldic lions, bearers of the Leeson arms. Russborough&#x27;s central block contains seven principal rooms on the ground floor with the largest, the Entrance Hall at centre of the south front, and the main reception room, the Saloon placed directly to its north. The other five rooms, originally comprising two Drawing Rooms, two Dining Rooms, and a Music Room complete a symmetrical arrangement. The ceilings of several rooms and the main stairhall feature elaborate stucco work attributed to the Swiss-Italian stuccodores, Paolo and Filippo Lafrancini.

The Russborough demesne extends to 200 acres, with a number of walks, gardens and original 18th century features. From the start, the estate was laid out to a formal design. This is still reflected in the remnants of the extensive lawn and terraces with a shaped pond in the middle to the north of the house. Meanwhile, to the south there is a more naturalistic prospect with rolling fields, serpentine lakes and mature woodland. It remains an almost intact example of an Irish demesne from this period, with features such as the Walled Garden, the ice-house and the lime kiln.

There is a 2 km maze, craft courtyard of artisan studios and The National Bird of Prey Centre.

==Art collections==
Russborough has housed two fine art collections, begun with the Milltown estate, whose collection was donated to the National Gallery of Ireland by the widow of the sixth earl, Lady Geraldine Milltown in 1902.

Sir Alfred and Clementine, Lady Beit, a cousin of the Mitford sisters, bought the house in 1952 where he housed his own family&#x27;s collection, started by his uncle, Alfred Beit, comprising works by many great artists. Sir Alfred and Lady Beit established the Alfred Beit Foundation as a registered charity in 1976 to safeguard the house and collections for future generations. In 1987, they donated seventeen of their finest paintings to the National Gallery of Ireland. Russborough opened to the public as a museum and visitor attraction in 1978. Among the Collection&#x27;s treasures still in Russborough are an outstanding array of eighteenth-century French and English furniture, many important paintings from the 17th to 20th centuries. Four Vernet paintings entitled &#x27;Morning&#x27;, &#x27;Midday&#x27;, &#x27;Sunset&#x27;, and &#x27;Night&#x27; were actually painted for Russborough in the 1750s and had remained in the house for most of the last 260 years. In addition it exhibits one of the finest private collections of 18th-century silver and porcelain in Ireland, including significant pieces by Meissen and Sèvres.

===Art robberies===
Portions of the Russborough collection have been stolen on multiple occasions.

These include thefts in: 1974 by an IRA gang including British heiress Rose Dugdale which resulted in nineteen paintings being stolen with all nineteen eventually recovered; in 1986 Martin Cahill stole eighteen paintings with sixteen eventually recovered; in 2001 two paintings were stolen with both recovered the next year, and in 2002 by Martin Cahill&#x27;s associate Martin Foley five paintings were stolen with all five later recovered.

Two paintings, Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bacelli&quot; and Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Lady writing a Letter with her Maid&quot;, the latter probably the most valuable painting of the collection, were stolen twice across the thefts, although each was subsequently recovered (the latter in 1993, the same year as the recovery of Goya&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Dona Antonia Zarate&quot;).

As of February 2025, only two of the stolen paintings by Francesco Guardi of Venetian landscapes have not been recovered.

===List of notable works from the collection===
==In popular culture==
Russborough House was used as a setting in 2011 film &quot;Haywire&quot;, and the 2016 film &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;.

The house was featured in Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries at the Castle&quot;.

The external view of the house was used in the 2012 mini series &quot;Titanic: Blood and Steel&quot;.

The 2023 film &quot;Baltimore&quot; was about the theft and recovery of nineteen old master paintings from the collection, valued at IR£8 million, by British heiress Rose Dugdale and other IRA members.

<doc id="1180485" wikidata="Q10878191" url="?curid=1180485" title="Damson">
<text>The damson (), damson plum, or damascene (&quot;Prunus domestica&quot; subsp. &quot;insititia&quot;, sometimes &quot;Prunus insititia&quot;), is an edible drupaceous fruit, a subspecies of the plum tree. Varieties of &quot;insititia&quot; are found across Europe, but the name &quot;damson&quot; is derived from and most commonly applied to forms that are native to Great Britain. Damsons are small, ovoid, plum-like fruit with a distinctive, somewhat astringent taste, and are widely used for culinary purposes, particularly in fruit preserves and jams.

In South and Southeast Asia, the term &quot;damson plum&quot; sometimes refers to jamblang, the fruit from a tree in the family Myrtaceae. The name &quot;mountain damson&quot; or &quot;bitter damson&quot; was also formerly applied in Jamaica to the tree &quot;Simarouba amara&quot;. Terminalia microcarpa and Chrysophyllum oliviforme are also sometimes referred to as damson plums.

==History==

The name damson comes from Middle English &quot;damascene&quot;, &quot;damesene&quot;, &quot;damasin&quot;, &quot;damsin&quot;, and ultimately from the Latin &quot;(prunum) damascenum&quot;, &quot;plum of Damascus&quot;. One commonly stated theory is that damsons were first cultivated in antiquity in the area around the ancient city of Damascus, capital of modern-day Syria, and were introduced into England by the Romans. The historical link between the Roman-era &quot;damascenum&quot; and the north and west European damson is rather tenuous despite the adoption of the older name. The &quot;damascenum&quot; described by Roman and Greek authors of late antiquity has more of the character of a sweet dessert plum, not fitting well to the damson plum. Remnants of damsons are sometimes found during archaeological digs of ancient Roman camps across England, and they have clearly been cultivated, and consumed, for centuries. Damson stones have been found in an excavation in Hungate, York, and dated to the late period of Anglo-Saxon England.

The exact origin of &quot;Prunus domestica&quot; subsp. &quot;insititia&quot; is not known with certainty. It is often thought to have arisen in wild crosses, possibly in Asia Minor, between the sloe, &quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;, and the cherry plum, &quot;Prunus cerasifera&quot;. Despite this, tests on cherry plums and damsons have indicated that it is possible that the damson developed directly from forms of sloe, perhaps via the round-fruited varieties known as bullaces, and that the cherry plum did not play a role in its parentage. &quot;Insititia&quot; plums of various sorts, such as the German &quot;Kriechenpflaume&quot; or French &quot;quetsche&quot;, occur across Europe and the word &quot;damson&quot; is sometimes used to refer to them in English, but many of the English varieties from which the name &quot;damson&quot; was originally taken have both a different typical flavour and pear-shaped (pyriform) appearance compared with continental forms. Robert Hogg commented that &quot;the Damson seems to be a fruit peculiar to England. We do not meet with it abroad, nor is any mention of it made in any of the pomological works or nurseryman&#x27;s catalogues on the Continent&quot;. As time progressed, a distinction developed between the varieties known as &quot;damascenes&quot; and the (usually smaller) types called &quot;damsons&quot;, to the degree that by 1891 they were the subject of a lawsuit when a Nottinghamshire grocer complained about being supplied one when he had ordered the other.

In addition to providing fruit, the damson makes a tough hedge or windbreak, and it became the favoured hedging tree in certain parts of the country such as Shropshire and Kent. Elsewhere damsons were used in orchards to protect less hardy trees, though orchards entirely composed of damson trees were a feature of some areas, notably the Lyth Valley of Westmorland and the Teme Valley in the Malverns, and indeed damsons were the only plum planted commercially north of Norfolk.

There is a body of anecdotal evidence that damsons were used in the British dye and cloth manufacturing industries in the 18th and 19th centuries, with examples occurring in every major damson-growing area (Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Westmorland, Shropshire and Worcestershire). Stories that damsons were used to dye khaki army uniforms are particularly common. However, a 2005 report for conservancy body English Nature could find no documentary evidence within the dyeing industry that damsons were ever a source of dye, noting that use of natural dyes declined rapidly after the 1850s, and concluded that &quot;there seems no evidence that damsons were used extensively or techniques [for using them] developed&quot;. The main recorded use of damsons in the industrial era was in commercial jam-making, and orchards were widespread until the Second World War, after which changing tastes, the effect of wartime sugar rationing, and the relatively high cost of British-grown fruit caused a steep decline.

The damson was introduced into the American colonies by English settlers before the American Revolution. It was regarded as thriving better in the continental United States than other European plum varieties; many of the earliest references to European plums in American gardens concern the damson. A favourite of early colonists, the tree has escaped from gardens and can be found growing wild in states such as Idaho.

==Characteristics==

The main characteristic of the damson is its distinctive rich flavour; unlike other plums it is both high in sugars and highly astringent. The fruit of the damson can also be identified by its shape, which is usually ovoid and slightly pointed at one end, or pyriform; its smooth-textured yellow-green flesh; and its skin, which ranges from dark blue to indigo to near-black depending on the variety (other types of &quot;Prunus domestica&quot; can have purple, yellow or red skin). Most damsons are of the &quot;clingstone&quot; type, where the flesh adheres to the stone. The damson is broadly similar to the semi-wild bullace, also classified as ssp. &quot;insititia&quot;, which is a smaller but invariably round plum with purple or yellowish-green skin. Damsons generally have a deeply furrowed stone, unlike bullaces, and unlike prunes cannot be successfully dried. Most individual damson varieties can be conclusively identified by examining the fruit&#x27;s stone, which varies in shape, size and texture.

The tree blossoms with small, white flowers in early April in the Northern hemisphere and fruit is harvested from late August to September or October, depending on the cultivar.

Damsons do take a long time to bear fruit, as the ancient rhyme has it:-

&quot;He who plants plums

Plants for his sons.

He who plants damsons

Plants for his grandsons.&quot;

==Cultivars==
Several cultivars have been selected, and some are found in Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. There are still relatively few varieties of damson, with &quot;The Garden&quot; recording no more than &quot;eight or nine varieties&quot; in existence at the end of the 19th century; some are self-fertile and can reproduce from seed as well as by grafting. The cultivars &#x27;Farleigh Damson&#x27; and &#x27;Prune Damson&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

* &#x27;Farleigh Damson&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Crittenden&#x27;s Prolific&#x27;, &#x27;Strood Cluster&#x27;) is named after the village of East Farleigh in Kent, where it was raised by James Crittenden in the early 19th century. An 1871 letter to the &quot;Journal of horticulture and practical gardening&quot; claimed that the original seedling had been found by a Mr. Herbert, the tenant of a market garden in Strood, who had given it to Crittenden. It has small, roundish, black fruit, with a blue bloom, and is a very heavy bearer. Its heavy cropping led to it being widely planted in England.

* &#x27;Shropshire Prune&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Prune Damson&#x27;, &#x27;Long Damson&#x27;, &#x27;Damascene&#x27;, &#x27;Westmoreland Damson&#x27;, &#x27;Cheshire Damson&#x27;) is a very old variety; its blue-purple, ovoid fruit has a distinctively &quot;full rich astringent&quot; flavour considered superior to other damsons, and it was thought particularly suitable for canning. Hogg states that this was the variety that became specifically associated with the old name &quot;damascene&quot;. The local types often known as the &quot;Westmoreland Damson&quot; and &quot;Cheshire Damson&quot; are described as synonymous with the Shropshire Prune by the horticulturalist Harold Taylor and others. The Shropshire was also the best-known variety of damson in the United States.
* Similar to the Shropshire Prune and possibly part of the same landrace, &#x27;Aylesbury Prune&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Bucks Prune&#x27;, &#x27;Michaelmas Prune&#x27;) is a semi-wild plum of damson type from the area of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire centred on Ivinghoe. It is relatively large-fruited and was considered by growers to have a high resistance to silver leaf, although was reputed to be poor for canning. Along with the Victoria plum, the Aylesbury Prune was one of the parents of the culinary plum &#x27;Laxton&#x27;s Cropper&#x27;. Although orchards of the Aylesbury Prune are now rare, Aylesbury Vale District Council has made efforts to conserve it.
* &#x27;Frogmore&#x27; is a cultivar first grown in the 19th century in the Royal Gardens at Frogmore, where it was raised by head gardener Thomas Ingram. It described as having sweet, round-oval, purplish black fruit, which ripen in early September.
* &#x27;King of the Damsons&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Bradley&#x27;s King&#x27;) is a Nottinghamshire late-season variety, making a vigorous and spreading tree with foliage that turns a distinctive yellow in autumn. It was first distributed by Bradley &amp; Sons of Halam in around 1880. The medium to large, obovoid purple fruit is relatively sweet with dryish flesh.
* &#x27;Merryweather&#x27; is a popular 20th century cultivar, introduced by the firm of Henry Merryweather &amp; Sons of Southwell, Nottinghamshire in 1907. The tree&#x27;s parentage is unknown; it has leaves well above the size of other damsons, and is thought to have at least some culinary plum ancestry. The fruit is deep blue, large, and noticeably sweet when ripe, although having genuine damson astringency.
* &#x27;Early Rivers&#x27;, registered in 1871, was raised by Rivers&#x27; Nursery from a seed of the variety &quot;St Etienne&quot;, and has roundish fruit with a chalky bloom. The small, red-purple clingstone damsons ripen as early as mid-August: they have juicy flesh but lack &quot;true damson flavour&quot;.
* &#x27;Blue Violet&#x27; originated in Westmoreland (likely as a hybrid or development of &#x27;Shropshire Prune&#x27;) and was first sent to the National Fruit Trials in the 1930s. An early variety, fruiting in August, it was long thought to have been lost but a few trees were discovered in the Lake District in 2007.
* &#x27;Common Damson&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Small Round Damson&#x27;) was a traditional cultivar with small, black fruit, being probably very close to wild specimens. It had a mealy texture and acid flavour, and by the 1940s it was no longer planted.

A type of damson once widely grown in County Armagh, Ireland, was never definitely identified but generally known as the Armagh damson; its fruit were particularly well regarded for canning. Local types of English prune such as the Gloucestershire &#x27;Old Pruin&#x27;, are sometimes described as damson varieties.

==White damson==
Although the majority of damson varieties are blue-black or purple in colour, there are at least two now-rare forms of &quot;white damson&quot;, both having green or yellow-green skin. The National Fruit Collection has accessions of the &quot;White Damson (Sergeant)&quot; and the larger &quot;White Damson (Taylor)&quot;, both of which may first have been mentioned in the 1620s.

To confuse matters, the White Bullace was in the past sold in London markets under the name of &quot;white damson&quot;. Bullaces can usually be distinguished from damsons by their spherical shape, relatively smooth stones, and poorer flavour, and generally ripen up to a month later in the year than damsons.

==Uses==

The skin of the damson can have a very tart flavour, particularly when unripe (the term &quot;damson&quot; is often used to describe red wines with rich yet acidic plummy flavours). The fruit is therefore most often used for cooking, and is commercially grown for preparation in jam and other fruit preserves. Some varieties of damson, however, such as &quot;Merryweather&quot;, are sweet enough to eat directly from the tree, and most are palatable raw if allowed to fully ripen. They can also be pickled, canned, or otherwise preserved. 

Because damson stones may be difficult and time-consuming to separate from the flesh, preserves, such as jam or fruit butter, are often made from whole fruit. Most cooks then remove the stones, but others, either in order not to lose any of the pulp or because they believe the flavour is better, leave the stones in the final product. A limited number of damson stones left in jam is supposed to impart a subtle almond flavour, though as with all plums damson stones contain the cyanogenic glycoside amygdalin, a toxin.

Damson gin is made in a similar manner to sloe gin, although less sugar is necessary as the damsons are sweeter than sloes. &quot;Insititia&quot; varieties similar to damsons are used to make slivovitz, a distilled plum spirit made in Slavic countries. Damson wine was once common in England: a 19th-century reference said that &quot;good damson wine is, perhaps, the nearest approach to good port that we have in England. No currant wine can equal it&quot;.

<text>Richard Alan Bonynge ( ) (born 29 September 1930) is an Australian conductor and pianist. He is the widower of Australian dramatic coloratura soprano Dame Joan Sutherland. Bonynge conducted virtually all of Sutherland&#x27;s operatic performances from 1962 until her retirement in 1990.

==Biography==
Bonynge was born in Epping, a suburb of Sydney, and educated at Sydney Boys&#x27; High School before studying piano at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and gaining a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London, where his piano teacher was Herbert Fryer. He gave up his music scholarship, continuing his private piano studies, and became a coach for singers. One of these was Joan Sutherland, whom he had accompanied in Australia. They married in 1954 and became a duo, performing operatic recitals until 1962. When the scheduled conductor for a recital of operatic arias became ill and the replacement conductor was involved in a car accident, Bonynge stepped in and, from that time on, he conducted virtually all of his wife&#x27;s performances.

His debut as an opera conductor took place in 1963 in Vancouver, where he conducted &quot;Faust&quot;. The same year, also in Vancouver, he conducted &quot;Norma&quot; for the first time, starring Sutherland and Marilyn Horne. He also conducted the English Chamber Orchestra in many recordings.

By doing some research and reading up on Massenet and Italian bel canto composers, Bonynge discovered Massenet&#x27;s own statement about his opera &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; being his &quot;best achievement.&quot; This filled Bonynge with curiosity, even more because &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; had sunk into almost total oblivion and had hardly been performed at all since the end of the 19th century. He obtained a tattered vocal score of it in Paris, and subsequently bought the full orchestral score from an auction in New York City. Although Sutherland was initially sceptical about &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;, Bonynge became an enthusiast of the work and eventually convinced her that she should perform the role of Esclarmonde herself. The San Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera premieres of &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; took place in 1974 and 1976 respectively.

In 1977 he was the founding music director of the Vancouver Opera Orchestra, when he conducted &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; staged there (in which his wife also took part).

Bonynge made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 12 December 1966, and his last performance there was on 6 April 1991. Most of those performances he conducted there between 1966 and 1987 were with Sutherland singing. From the 1960s until the early 1970s, his speciality was music of 18th and early 19th century, mostly in bel canto repertoire of Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. Bonynge then gradually added also middle Verdi (&quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;), Offenbach (&quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;), then also Massenet (&quot;Esclarmonde&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;).

Bonynge has recorded extensively in the ballet genre: Delibes&#x27;s three ballets – &quot;La Source&quot;, &quot;Coppélia&quot;, &quot;Sylvia&quot;; Riccardo Drigo&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;Le Réveil de Flore&quot;; Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Le papillon&quot;; Friedrich Burgmüller&#x27;s &quot;La Péri&quot;; and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s three ballets – &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. One of Bonynge&#x27;s most valuable contributions to ballet music is a 10 CD &quot;Compendium of Ballet Rarities&quot; which have been rarely recorded but are often performed by established ballet companies, such as several famous Pas de deux and ballets performed in operas.

His recordings also include some works with no operatic or balletic associations, such as the Harp Concerto in E-flat by Reinhold Glière, with harpist Osian Ellis.

Commencing in 2007, he has conducted a series of performances in a few opera houses around the U.S. (Florida Grand Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre), and now is mostly involved with the Opera Australia company (&quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in August 2008, and in 2006 for Opera Queensland; &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; in Melbourne and Sydney in middle of 2009).

He lives in Les Avants, Switzerland and maintains a home in Sydney. He is regularly involved in the philanthropic activities of the Joan Sutherland &amp; Richard Bonynge Foundation, often chairing the panel of judges for their annual Bel Canto Award.

==Honours and awards==

Bonynge was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to music in 1977. In 1983, he was made Officer of the Order of Australia, and in 1989 a &quot;Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot;. 

On 26 January 2012, Bonynge was promoted within the Order of Australia to Companion, for &quot;eminent service to the performing arts as an acclaimed conductor and musical scholar, to classical singing and the promotion of opera, and through the collection and preservation of operatic manuscripts.&quot;

<text>Pauline Emily Meiggs (née Gregg; 17 July 1909 – 11 March 2006), who wrote under the name Pauline Gregg, was a British historian.

==Early life and education==
Born at Palmers Green, north London, to working-class parents Thomas James Nathaniel Gregg, a Post Office mail sorter, and Elizabeth Janette (née Kuttner), Gregg was attracted to socialism during her schooldays, joining the Labour League of Youth and Independent Labour Party, and addressing meetings from a coal cart, later from Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park. Having started work as a secretary at Longman, in 1932 she was able, with a loan from Middlesex County Council, to take a place at the London School of Economics. Her doctorate, on John Lilburne, leader of the Levellers, was the basis of a book, &quot;Free-Born John&quot;, published in 1961.

==Career==
Gregg was offered a lectureship at Hillcroft College, Surbiton, south-west London, but joined the Ministry of Supply when the Second World War began, and was posted to Warwick. There she met Russell Meiggs, a classics fellow at Balliol College, Oxford; they married in 1941. From 1946, they were in charge of Holywell Manor, Oxford, an annexe of Balliol, housing fifty undergraduates; although finding housework dull, Gregg was &quot;a dashing hostess&quot;. During this time, Gregg daily researched at the Bodleian Library; her first book, &quot;A Social and Economic History of Britain 1760-1950&quot;, became a standard reference work, and her &quot;definitive&quot; biographies of King Charles I and the regicide Cromwell were well-regarded, C. V. Wedgwood, herself an expert on 17th century English history and author of many books on the period, calling the former &quot;the fullest and most carefully compiled that we are ever likely to have&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gregg and her husband, Russell Meiggs, had two daughters. She was survived by them, and by seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

==Works==
Gregg&#x27;s published works concentrated on the period of the English Civil Wars of the 17th century and the history of social life in Britain.

Her writings include:
*&quot;King Charles I&quot;: Biography of Charles I.
*&quot;Free-Born John&quot;: Biography of John Lilburne.
*&quot;Modern Britain&quot;: A social and economic history since 1760.
*&quot;The Welfare State&quot;: An economic and social history of Great Britain from 1945 to the present day (see Welfare state).
*&quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;: Biography of Oliver Cromwell.
*&quot;The Chain of History&quot;: The story of the main links in the chain of man&#x27;s development from the Stone Age to the end of the 19th century. 
*&quot;Black Death to Industrial Revolution&quot;: A Social and Economic History of England from the time of the Black Death to the Industrial Revolution.

<text>Leontios Machairas or Makhairas (Greek: Λεόντιος Μαχαιράς, French: Léonce Machéras; about 1380 - after 1432) was a historian in medieval Cyprus.

The main source of information on him is his chronicle, written in the medieval Cypriot dialect, titled &quot;Ἐξήγησις τῆς γλυκείας χώρας Κύπρου&quot; &quot;ἡ ποία λέγεται Κρόνακα, τοὐτέστιν Χρονικόν&quot; (Chronicle of the sweet land of Cyprus). The chronicle documents events from the visit of Saint Helena to Cyprus until the times of the Kingdom of Cyprus. Machairas was Orthodox Christian but wrote with respect for the pope and the Catholic ruling class of Cyprus for whom he was working. At the same time he showed his hatred towards the Venetians and the Genoese. He is the only source on the &quot;Re Alexis&quot; rebellion of Cypriot serfs, which he condemned. Following the usual Byzantine practice, he only used the word &quot;&quot;basileus&quot; (Greek for sovereign) for the Byzantine emperor at Constantinople, and referred to the king of Cyprus as &quot;regas&quot;&quot; (from Latin &quot;rex&quot; king). Machairas was also present at the Battle of Choirokoitia. The text as we have it became abbreviated after 1432, and historians believe the remainder of the text is a subsequent accretion.

There are manuscripts of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, and Ravenna. The Oxford manuscript was copied in Paphos in June 1555, according to an additional paragraph after the end of the chronicle. The chronicle was published by Konstantinos Sathas as part of his &quot;Medieval Library&quot; in Venice in 1873. The chronicles of Cyprus by Amadi and Diomede Strambaldi published by Rene de Mas Latrie in Paris in 1891 were translations of Machairas&#x27;s chronicle into Italian.

The chronicle was published again by Richard M. Dawkins with an English translation as &quot;Recital Concerning the Sweet Land of Cyprus Entitled &#x27;Chronicle&#x27; - The chronicle of Makhairas&quot; in Oxford in 1932. The Ravenna manuscript has not yet been incorporated into a critical edition.

== Manuscripts ==
Three manuscripts of the Chronicle survive:

* Venice: Biblioteca Marciana. Gr. VII, 16, 1080
* Oxford: Bodleian Library. Selden, Supra 14 (dated 1555)
* Ravenna: Biblioteca Classense, cod. gr. 187, fol. 1-184 (late 16th century)

<text>William Angus VC (28 February 1888 – 14 June 1959), also known as Willie Angus, was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Angus was born at Polkemmet Rows, Cappers, Armadale. After leaving school he was employed as a miner, but was able to find himself a place as a professional footballer at Carluke Rovers, before moving to Celtic, although he never played for the first team. Angus made two Scottish League appearances on loan to Vale of Leven in 1912. Released in 1914, he joined Wishaw Thistle, the club he was captaining when war was declared in August. As a member of local Territorial battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, he was mobilised immediately.

==First World War==
Early in 1915 his company, from 8th Bn HLI, was transferred to the 8th Royal Scots, the first Territorial battalion to join the Expeditionary Force. 8th Royal Scots had suffered a great many casualties and were in urgent need of replacements. He was serving as a lance-corporal in this battalion when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 12 June 1915 at Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée, France, Lance-Corporal Angus voluntarily left his trench to rescue a wounded officer, fellow Carluke man Lieutenant James Martin, who was lying within a few yards of the enemy&#x27;s position and had been injured by a mine. To do this he had to travel through 64 metres in no-man&#x27;s land under heavy bomb and rifle fire, and received about 40 wounds, some of them being very serious, including the loss of his left eye. His commanding officer said there had been no braver deed in the history of the British Army.

==Aftermath==
After the rescue he was taken to a military hospital in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he learned of his award of the Victoria Cross. After 2 months in hospital he returned to London where he was given the Victoria Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 30 August 1915. When the King commented on his 40 injuries, Angus was said to have answered &quot;Aye, sir, but only 13 were serious.&quot;.
After he had returned to Carluke, he was given a hero&#x27;s welcome and received standing ovations at Celtic Park and Ibrox. Following the war, he started business as a goods carrier. He married and had five children.

He also became president of Carluke Rovers, a position he held until his death in 1959. Each year of his life, he received a telegram of thanks from the family of the man he rescued.

He is buried, together with his wife Mary, at Wilton Cemetery, in Carluke. His grave is easily found, at the North Eastern part of the Wilton, as the headstone has the image of a VC engraved on it. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National War Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

In 2015, on the centenary of his heroic acts, a commemorative stone was laid in Carluke. A memorial stone was also laid at his birthplace in Armadale.

<text>SMATV is Single Master Antenna Television (or Satellite Master Antenna Television),
The purpose of SMATV is for supplying and controlling the number and type of channels to multiple televisions. Not only TV channels but FM channels as well. It provides Reception of DBS TV/FM channels for hotels, motels, dormitories, schools, hospitals and commercial properties with multiple tenants. Using a master antenna system video signals, audio signals and decoder signals can also be distributed.

It consists of single outdoor unit or antenna feeding to number of indoor units. The channels accessible are independent of other users. For maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio at all the indoor units served, a larger antenna is required, typically to in diameter.
A SMATV headend is used to receive and rebroadcast satellite television channels throughout a property from a single satellite feed.

The system consists of a master antenna and a matching transformer to match the balanced antenna with unbalanced cable and amplifiers. Most antennas have an impedance of around 300 Ω. To convert it to 75 Ω, a matching transformer (or balun) is used. For trunk line isolation, a resistive inductive device known as a splitter is used. The amplifier output is fed to the splitter through coaxial trunk lines.

There are several methods of distribution that are often used in a SMATV headend. These include:
* IPTV (Internet Protocol) TV Systems
* COM1000 Pro:Idiom Encrypted HD Headend
* L-Band Satellite TV Distribution
There are two main approaches for distribution of digital TV signals in SMATV installations:
* Transmodulation from satellite quaternary phase shift keying QPSK to quadrature amplitude modulation QAM
* Direct distribution of QPSK

In the United States, the satellite carriers providing the satellite TV signal for SMATV headend systems are:
*DirecTV
*Dish Network

Florida state law chapter 4279, approved June 2, 1893, extended the powers of the company to include issuing bonds, and required the bridge to be a drawbridge.

The toll was not to exceed five cents per pedestrian, 25 cents for one-horse vehicles, 50 cents for two-horse vehicles, and other reasonable rates for other classes.

The corporation would dissolve after 99 years.

<text>Lachhiman Gurung (; 30 December 1917 – 12 December 2010) was a Nepalese–British Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is best known as the &quot;Gurkha who took on 200 soldiers with only one hand&quot; because of his actions in World War II.

==Birth and army service==
Gurung was born on 30 December 1917, in the village of Dahakhani VDC (now also called Ichchhakamana Rural Municipality), Chitwan District of Nepal, the son of Partiman Gurung. He joined the British Indian Army in December 1940, permitted to enlist in wartime although he was only 4&#x27;11&quot; (1.5m) tall and so below the peacetime minimum height. He was 27 years old, and a rifleman in the 4th Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles, in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place in May 1945 for which he was awarded the VC.

His Battalion was part of the 89th Indian Infantry Brigade of 7th Indian Infantry Division, which was ordered to cross the Irrawaddy River and attack Japanese forces to the north of the road from Prome to Taungup. The Japanese withdrew towards Taungdaw, where Gurung was part of the two companies of the 4th Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles, waiting when the Japanese attacked in force in the early morning.

On 12/13 May 1945 at Taungdaw, Burma (now Myanmar), Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung was manning the most forward post of his platoon which bore the brunt of an attack by at least 200 of the Japanese enemy. He hurled back two hand grenades which had fallen on his trench, but the third exploded in his right hand after he attempted to throw it back, blowing off his fingers, shattering his arm and severely wounding him in the face, body and right leg. His two comrades were also badly wounded but the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his wounds, loaded and fired his rifle with his left hand for four hours (all while he screamed &quot;Come and fight a Gurkha!&quot;), calmly waiting for each attack which he met with fire at point blank range.

His citation in the London Gazette ends with...
He received his Victoria Cross from the Viceroy of India, Field Marshal Lord Wavell at the Red Fort in Delhi on 19 December 1945. 

==Further information and later life==

Gurung was hospitalised for the wounds he received during the above action and subsequently lost his right eye and the use of his right hand, but he continued to serve with the 8th Gurkhas, choosing to remain with them when they were transferred to the newly independent Indian Army in 1947. He later achieved the rank of Hon. Havildar and he returned to his village in Nepal on completion of his service in 1947, where he farmed on a small holding.

He married twice; having two sons and a daughter from his first marriage, and two more sons from his second. One of his sons later became an officer in the 8th Gurkha Rifles.

A new house was provided for him and his family in 1995 near the Gurkha Welfare Centre at Chitwan, using a donation of £2,000 from Armourers and Brasiers Company. Later in 1995, he received a cheque for £100,500 from the Gurkha Welfare Trust, presented by British Prime Minister John Major at 10 Downing Street. £8,000 was also awarded to him by the Indian Army as a loan for his Victoria Cross medal, which he gave to them as an inspiration for young servicemen.

In 2008, Gurung and Honorary Lieutenant Tul Bahadur Pun VC were two of the five claimants in a legal claim to allow Gurkha servicemen who had retired before July 1997 (when the Gurkha base moved from Hong Kong to the UK) to settle in the UK. The High Court ordered the government to review its policy, and Gurung was allowed to settle in Hounslow, where he was looked after by his granddaughter, Amrita.

Gurung was admitted to the Charing Cross Hospital on 19 November after his health condition worsened, suffering from pneumonia. Gurung died on 12 December 2010. He was surrounded by his second wife, Manmaya, and his five children.

His funeral was held on Wednesday 22 December 2010 at Hounslow Civic Centre, Lampton Road, Hounslow, Middlesex, TW3 4DN.

==The medal==
The medal is currently held in India, in the possession of Gurung&#x27;s parent unit, the 4th Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles.

<doc id="1180527" wikidata="Q4821369" url="?curid=1180527" title="Augustus Anson">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Augustus Henry Archibald Anson VC (5 March 1835 – 17 November 1877) was a member of the Anson family and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He served as Member of Parliament for Lichfield from 1859 until 1868, and for Bewdley from 1869 to 1874.

==Early life and family==
Anson was born at Shugborough Hall, the third son of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield, by Louisa Catherine Philips, daughter of Nathaniel Philips, of Slebech Hall, Pembrokeshire. Thomas Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield and Rev. Adelbert Anson were his brothers.

==Military career==

===Crimean War and transfer===
Anson entered the army at age 18, purchasing a commission as an ensign in the Rifle Brigade. He spent the first part of his career at the regimental depot, where he was promoted to lieutenant. In January 1855, he joined the Rifle Brigades fighting in Crimea. However, following the capture of Sevastopol in September 1855, Anson left active service and was transferred to the 84th Regiment of Foot (later the 2nd Bn, York and Lancaster Regiment), in Burma, to join the staff of his uncle Major-General George Anson, Commander-in-Chief, India. Through this move, he was able to &quot;obtain double pay and double promotion, and to escape all further regimental duty&quot; in Crimea, where the bloody war would continue a further five months.

The circumstances of his transfer, first reported in the &quot;Weekly Chronicle of the United Service&quot; in March 1856, caused anger among the public, as reflected in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, whose author cast the ultimate blame on Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces; and Baron Panmure, the Secretary of State for War:

&quot;I do not blame Captain Anson for this act, nor do I blame General Anson for it. They have but acted according to the customs sanctioned by the Horse Guards at home. The real culprits are Lords Hardinge and Panmure. The latter nobleman made his debut as Minister of War in the character of a military reformer, which I fear he will scarcely be able to sustain after the Dowbiggin exposure. We have seen him at the very moment when England was mourning Lord Raglan&#x27;s loss-when hundreds of British parents were weeping for their children whose lives had been uselessly wasted on the glacis of the Redan—when our statesmen, perplexed where to look for military talent, had at last doubtfully decided on General Simpson as a temporary stop-gap—we have seen Lord Panmure, I say, at such a moment, in the midst of England&#x27;s perplexity and sorrow, availing himself of the very despatch in which he had announced to the overtasked old General the high position which had been forced upon him in order to obtain for his nephew [Capt. Dowbiggin] the promotion which he feared he could not obtain on his own merits; and, I am sorry to say, we have heard the Premier of England declare in Parliament that he thought the content of that despatch redounded to Lord Pamure&#x27;s honour!&quot;

===Indian Mutiny===

At 22 years old and a captain in the 84th Regiment during the Indian Mutiny, when the following deeds took place on 28 September 1857 at Bolandshahr and at Lucknow, on 16 November 1857, for which he was awarded the VC. Despatch from Major-General Sir James Hope Grant, dated 12 August 1858:

Anson later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Political career==

In 1859, he was elected Member of Parliament for Lichfield as a Liberal, holding the seat until 1868. Although losing the by-election in 1869 for Bewdley the election was overturned on petition and the seat was awarded to him. He won the subsequent election and remained in parliament until 1874.

In 1870, he was one of two directors of The Land and Sea Telegraph Construction Company Ltd. as it applied to be wound up, the other being William Palliser. Anson was then &quot;of Dudley House, Park-lane, in the county of Middlesex&quot;.

==Personal life==

On his return to England, he married Amelia Claughton, a daughter of Rev. Thomas Legh Claughton, the future first Bishop of St Albans. 

Anson died at the age of 42 in Cannes, France, and was buried there. There is a memorial plaque to him in Lichfield Cathedral.

<text>The Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company (FCLCTC) was chartered in 1881 to construct a series of canals connecting existing lakes and rivers between St. Augustine and Lake Worth, Florida. The company begun through the urging of St. Augustine residents, led by Dr. John Westcott, a prominent local politician. In 1893, railroad mogul Henry Flagler became associated with the company in order to help extend his railroad to the south of the state.

Florida state law chapter 3641, approved February 6, 1885, gave the company the ability to extend its canal from Biscayne Bay to Key West, and gave it land grants for that part.

Florida state law chapter 4284, approved May 27, 1893, extended the time limit for the company to construct the canal from St. Augustine to Biscayne Bay from June 1, 1894, to June 1, 1897; any sections completed after that date would not receive land grants.

Florida state law chapter 4283, approved June 2, 1893, authorized the company to give the portion along the Indian River between Goat Creek and Jupiter Inlet to the United States government, which planned to improve it.

<text>Adam Archibald VC (14 January 1879 – 10 March 1957) was a Scottish First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military service==
In 1915, Archibald enlisted with the 7th Durham Light Infantry before transferring to the 218th Field Company, Royal Engineers, with whom he was serving during the second battle of the Sambre. At the age of 39, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for action while his unit was attempting to bridge the Sambre–Oise Canal. Archibald received his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace in May 1919. From his citation:

His VC is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, Kent.

Archibald was so severely gassed during the VC winning incident, that he could not return to service. He was awarded the Silver War Badge for having been honourably discharged from the army due to wounds received in the war. This was to be worn by veterans so as not to receive a white feather or be otherwise perceived as cowards by members of the public when in civilian dress.

==Personal life==
Archibald was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge Elgin &amp; Bruce, No.1077 (Limekilns, Fife, Scotland) in 1912. He later affiliated to Lodge St James Operative, No.97 (Edinburgh, Scotland).

Archibald died at his home in Leith at the age of 78. He was cremated at Warriston Crematorium.

<doc id="1180539" wikidata="Q2368661" url="?curid=1180539" title="Surrogate endpoint">
<text>In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint (or surrogate marker) is a measure of effect of a specific treatment that may correlate with a &quot;real&quot; clinical endpoint but does not necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. The National Institutes of Health (USA) defines surrogate endpoint as &quot;a biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint&quot;.

Surrogate markers are used when the primary endpoint is undesired (e.g., death), or when the number of events is very small, thus making it impractical to conduct a clinical trial to gather a statistically significant number of endpoints. The FDA and other regulatory agencies will often accept evidence from clinical trials that show a direct clinical benefit to surrogate markers.

Surrogate endpoints can be obtained from different modalities, such as, behavioural or cognitive scores, or biomarkers from Electroencephalography (qEEG), MRI, PET, or biochemical biomarkers.

A correlate does not make a surrogate. It is a common misconception that if an outcome is a correlate (that is, correlated with the true clinical outcome) it can be used as a valid surrogate endpoint (that is, a replacement for the true clinical outcome). However, proper justification for such replacement requires that the effect of the intervention on the surrogate endpoint predicts the effect on the clinical outcome: a much stronger condition than correlation. In this context, the term &quot;Prentice criteria&quot; is used.

The term &quot;surrogate&quot; should not be used in describing endpoints. Instead, descriptions of results and interpretations should be formulated in terms that designate the specific nature and category of variable assessed.

A surrogate endpoint of a clinical trial is a laboratory measurement or a physical sign used as a substitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint that measures directly how a patient feels, functions or survives. Changes induced by a therapy on a surrogate endpoint are expected to reflect changes in a clinically meaningful endpoint.

== Examples ==
=== Cardiovascular disease ===
A commonly used example is cholesterol. While elevated cholesterol levels increase the likelihood for heart disease, the relationship is not linear - many people with normal cholesterol develop heart disease, and many with high cholesterol do not. &quot;Death from heart disease&quot; is the endpoint of interest, but &quot;cholesterol&quot; is the surrogate marker. A clinical trial may show that a particular drug (for example, simvastatin (Zocor)) is effective in reducing cholesterol, without showing directly that simvastatin prevents death. Proof of Zocor&#x27;s efficacy in reducing cardiovascular disease was only presented five years after its original introduction, and then only for secondary prevention. In another case, AstraZeneca was accused of marketing rosuvastatin (Crestor) without providing hard endpoint data, relying instead on surrogate endpoints. The company countered that rosuvastatin had been tested on larger groups of patients than any other drug in the class, and that its effects should be comparable to the other statins.

=== Cancer ===
Progression Free Survival is a prominent example in Oncology contexts. There are examples of cancer drugs approved on the basis of progression-free survival failed to show subsequent improvements in overall survival in subsequent studies. In breast cancer, Bevacizumab (Avastin) initially gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration, but subsequently had its license revoked. More patient focused surrogate endpoints may offer a more meaningful alternative such as Overall Treatment Utility.

=== Infectious disease ===
In HIV/AIDS medicine, CD4 counts and viral loads are used as surrogate markers for drug approval for clinical trials.

In hepatitis C medicine, the surrogate endpoint &quot;Sustained Virological Response&quot; has been used for the approval of expensive drugs known as Direct Acting Antivirals. The validity of this surrogate endpoint for predicting clinical outcomes has been challenged.

For several vaccines (anthrax, hepatitis A, etc), the induction of detectable antibodies in blood is used as a surrogate marker for vaccine effectiveness, as exposure of individuals to an actual pathogen is considered unethical.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
A recent study showed that plasma biomarkers have the potential to be used as surrogate biomarkers in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) clinical trials. More specifically, this study demonstrated that plasma p-tau181 could potentially be used to monitor large-scale population interventions targeting preclinical AD individuals.

==Criticism==
There have been a number of instances when studies using surrogate markers have been used to show benefit from a particular treatment, but later, a repeat study looking at endpoints has not shown a benefit, or has even shown a harm. In 2021, the FDA came under heavy criticism for the approval of an alzheimer&#x27;s drug called Aduhelm based on a surrogate endpoint that was later shown to be based on fraudulent data.

==Reporting Guidelines==
Reporting surrogate endpoints in randomized controlled trials is an emerging source of concern for clinicians and epidemiologists. This issue has been addressed in two reporting guidelines called CONSORT and SPIRIT, which will help researchers report surrogate endpoints in  randomized controlled trials.

<doc id="1180540" wikidata="Q3273203" url="?curid=1180540" title="Sewn boat">
<text>A sewn boat is a type of wooden boat which has its planks sewn, stitched, tied, or bound together with natural fibre rope (e.g. coir in the Indian Ocean) tendons or flexible wood, such as roots and willow branches. Sewn boat construction techniques were used in many parts of the world prior to the development of metal fasteners, and continued to be used long after that time for small boats to reduce construction costs where metal fasteners were too expensive.

==Name and similar techniques==
Although well established, the &quot;sewn boat&quot; name is somewhat misleading since it suggests textile or leather skin construction, as often found in kayaks. Some have proposed to use &quot;laced boats&quot; (Ge. &quot;geschnürte Boote&quot;) instead. A modern plywood construction method that resembles sewn boats is the stitch and glue method; in this technique plywood panels are stitched together, often with wire, and the seams are reinforced with fiberglass composite; the stitching may then be removed or may remain in place. Also related is the treenailed boat.

Lashed lug construction is used in the distinctive maritime technology of Austronesian peoples.

==Construction==
Sewn boats start with the construction of the hull, or outside &quot;shell&quot; of the boat, rather than the &quot;frame&quot;, resulting in a monocoque type of structure. Carefully shaped planks are connected at the edges. The planks may overlap, as in the Hjortspring boat, or joined flush at their edges, as is found in Arab dhows and along the coast of India. As the planks are placed together, the hull begins to bend into the desired shape. Internal framing may be added to the planks after they are sewn in, providing additional rigidity.

While wooden pegs (often called &quot;treenails&quot;) can be used to fasten thicker clinker planks, this technique only works if the planks are thick enough to hold the pegs. Because of this, large ships were often built using pegs, while smaller boats would use sewn planks.

The replica of the Belitung shipwreck, &quot;Jewel of Muscat&quot;, was built mostly by Indian shipwrights with extensive experience of sewn planking construction. The coir ropes used to sew the planks together were tightened to very close to their breaking strain. (This is in contrast to the much lower sewing tensions proposed in an earlier theoretical model.) The multiple stitches at each pair of holes and the relatively close spacing of those holes mean that there is a substantial clamping force holding the edges of the planks together. This has shown to have good structural properties and the designer argues that this is superior to a similar vessel with metal fastenings, where those fastenings concentrate forces whilst sewing distributes them across the hull structure.

==History==

The earliest surviving examples of plank-built boats are the Abydos boats, the earliest of which is dated to . These are sewn boats. The investigated example, BG10, had an unusual sewing technique, with the continuous fibrous strap running at right angles to the long direction of the planks. Therefore each length of strap went through all the planks on that side of the vessel. In contrast, other sewn boats that use continuous sewing (as opposed to a series of individual stitches) have the thread go along the seam between two planks.

A well-known early example of a sewn boat is the 40+ metres long &quot;Solar barque&quot; or funerary boat on show near the Gizeh pyramid in Egypt; it dates back from c. 2500 BC. The sewn construction was a natural step when coming from raft or reed boatbuilding, which dates from some thousands of years before that. The oldest sea-going vessel was the Zambratija boat in Croatia, c. 1200 BC. In other parts of the world, the oldest sewn craft comes from North Ferriby, where one sample (called &quot;F3&quot;) mass-spectrometry dates to 2030 BC. Later finds include some early Greek ships. The oldest Nordic find is the Hjortspring boat in Denmark (c 300 BC). In Finland, Russia, Karelia and Estonia small sewn boats have been constructed more recently; until the 1920s in poor areas of Russia.

Sewn construction is used in the various forms of the Austronesian &quot;proas&quot; of the Indo-Pacific (which also used the lashed-lug techniques) and the Middle Eastern and South Asian dhow native to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean. Despite their proximity and similarity, they differ markedly from each other, indicating that they developed independently. Austronesian boat-sewing techniques are discontinuous and are only visible from the inside surfaces of the hull, while South Asian and Middle Eastern boat-sewing techniques are visible in both the exterior and interior of the hull and are continuous.

== Comparison with other traditions ==
Though the sewn boat technique (but not the lashed lugs) is also used for boats in the western Indian Ocean traditions, it differs in that the stitching in Austronesian boats are discontinuous and only visible from the inside of the hull. This indicates that the sewn boat techniques of the Indian Ocean and Austronesia are not culturally-linked and developed independent of each other. The planks of ancient Austronesian ships were originally joined together using only the sewn boat technique. However, the development of metallurgy in Maritime Southeast Asia in the last two thousand years resulted in the replacement of the sewing technique with internal dowels, as well as increasing use of metal nails.

<text>Thomas Elsdon Ashford (1859 – 21 February 1913) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born in 1859 at 2 Peck&#x27;s Cottage, All Saints, Newmarket, Suffolk, the illegitimate son of Thomas Ashford, a boot maker and Emma Elsdon. Thomas joined the Army at Woolwich for the 49th Brigade on 12 June 1877.

==The VC action==
He was about 21 years old, and a private in The Royal Fusiliers, British Army during the Second Anglo-Afghan War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 August 1880 at Deh Khoja, near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Private Ashford assisted Lieutenant William St. Lucien Chase in rescuing and carrying for a distance of over 200 yards under the fire of the enemy, a wounded soldier who had taken shelter in a block-house and finally brought the wounded man to a place of safety. His citation read:

After his military service, Ashford settled in Thringstone, Leicestershire and served as a postman for many years. He was married in Thringstone Church to Betsy Ann Sisson on 29 January 1891. He later moved to the neighbouring village of Whitwick and died on 13 February 1913. He was laid to rest in Whitwick Cemetery, in the presence of thousands of mourners, though the grave lay unmarked for many years, until a monument was provided by the local British Legion. Three streets in Whitwick have since been named in his honour.

==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum in the Tower of London.

<doc id="1180554" wikidata="Q2977500" url="?curid=1180554" title="For Esmé—with Love and Squalor">
<text>&quot;For Esmé—with Love and Squalor&quot; is a short story by J. D. Salinger. It recounts an American sergeant&#x27;s meeting with a young girl before being sent into combat in World War II. Originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on April 8, 1950, it was anthologized in Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Nine Stories&quot; two years later (while the story collection&#x27;s American title is &quot;Nine Stories&quot;, it is titled as &quot;For Esmé—with Love &amp; Squalor and Other Stories&quot; in most other countries).

The short story was immediately popular with readers; less than two weeks after its publication, on April 20, Salinger &quot;had already gotten more letters about &#x27;For Esmé&#x27; than he had for any story he had published.&quot; According to biographer Kenneth Slawenski, the story is &quot;widely considered one of the finest literary pieces to result from the Second World War.&quot; Author Paul Alexander calls it a &quot;minor masterpiece&quot;.

When Salinger submitted the story to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in late 1949, it was at first returned, and he then reedited his manuscript, shortening it by six pages.

==Plot==
The narrator receives an invitation to a wedding that will take place in England, but will not be able to attend, because the wedding date conflicts with a planned visit from his wife&#x27;s mother. The narrator does not know the groom, but he knows the bride, having met her almost six years earlier. His response to the invitation is to offer a few written notes regarding the bride.

The first of the two episodes the narrator relates occurs during a stormy afternoon in Devon, England, in 1944. A group of enlisted American soldiers are finishing up training for intelligence operations in the upcoming D-Day landings. The narrator takes a solitary stroll into town, and enters a church to listen to a children&#x27;s choir rehearsal. One of the choir members, a girl of about thirteen, has a presence and deportment that draws his attention. When he departs, he finds that he has been strangely affected by the children&#x27;s &quot;melodious and unsentimental&quot; singing.

Ducking into a tearoom to escape the rain, the narrator encounters the girl again, this time accompanied by her little brother and their governess. Sensing his loneliness, the girl engages the narrator in conversation. The reader learns that her name is Esmé, and that she and her brother Charles are orphans – their mother dead, the father killed in North Africa while serving with the British Army. She wears his huge military wristwatch as a remembrance. Esmé is bright, well-mannered and mature for her age, but troubled that she may be a &quot;cold person&quot; and is striving to be more &quot;compassionate&quot;.

In the next episode, the scene changes to a military setting, and there is a deliberate shift in the point of view; the narrator no longer refers to himself as &quot;I&quot;, but as &quot;Sergeant X&quot;. Allied forces occupy Germany in the weeks following V-E Day. Sergeant X is stationed in Bavaria and has just returned to his quarters after visiting a field hospital where he has been treated for a nervous breakdown. He still exhibits the symptoms of his mental disorder. &quot;Corporal Z&quot; (surname Clay), a fellow soldier who has served closely with him, casually and callously remarks upon the sergeant&#x27;s physical deterioration. When Clay departs, Sergeant X begins to rifle through a batch of unopened letters and discovers a small package, postmarked from Devon almost a year before. It contains a letter from Esmé and Charles, and she has enclosed her father&#x27;s wristwatch – &quot;a talisman&quot; – and suggests to Sergeant X that he &quot;wear it for the duration of the war&quot;. Deeply moved, he immediately begins a recovery from his descent into disillusionment and spiritual vacancy, regaining his &quot;faculties&quot;.

== Analysis ==

As the war receded in memory, America was embracing an &quot;unquestioned patriotism and increasing conformity&quot;, and a romantic version of the war was gradually replacing its devastating realities. Salinger wished to speak for those who still struggled to cope with the &quot;inglorious&quot; aspects of combat.

&quot;For Esmé—with Love and Squalor&quot; was conceived as a tribute to those Second World War veterans who in post-war civilian life were still suffering from so-called &quot;battle fatigue&quot; – post-traumatic stress disorder. The story also served to convey to the general public what many ex-soldiers endured.

Salinger had served as a non-commissioned officer of intelligence services at the European front – the narrator &quot;Sergeant X&quot; is &quot;suspiciously like Salinger himself&quot;. The story is more than merely a personal recollection; rather, it is an effort to offer hope and healing – a healing of which Salinger himself partook. Slawenski points out that “though we may recognize Salinger in Sergeant X’s character, [WWII] veterans of the times recognized themselves.&quot;

== Characters ==

* Sergeant X: The narrator of the story. Just before shipping out to the Normandy in the first part, he describes his meeting with a young girl in Devon. The second part, which is told in the third person, is about the crisis experienced by the hero during the war days. In this section, his name is referred to as Staff Sergeant X.
* Esmé: She is a thirteen-year-old girl whom Sergeant X met the day before he joined the war. In the second part of the story, Esmé sends him a letter while Sergeant X is at war. At the beginning of the story, it is explained to the readers that Esmé will marry and also invited the Sergeant X to the wedding ceremony.
* Charles: Esmé&#x27;s five-year-old brother. He is with Esmé on the day he meets the Chief Sergeant.
* Corporal Z (Clay): He is the roommate of Staff Sergeant X in the European days after landing. Clay, an emotional, simple and rude man, is thought to be the symbol of the deprivation part of the story.
* Loretta: Clay&#x27;s fiancée. She often writes letters to Clay in the war.
* Ms. Megley: Ms. Megley, the caregivers of Esmé and Charles, is the person who brought the children to the teahouse on the day they met Staff Sergeant X.
* Staff Sergeant X&#x27;s wife: At the beginning of the story, the narrator (Staff Sergeant X) remembers the name. X explains that they decided not to go to Esmé&#x27;s wedding after talking to his wife.
* Grencher: Sergeant X&#x27;s Mother-in-law. The name is mentioned at the beginning of the story.
* Sergeant X&#x27;s older brother: In the second part of the story, he reads a thoughtlessly written letter from his older brother X.

== Publication history ==
&quot;For Esmé&quot; was originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in April 1950. In April 1953, Little, Brown and Company (a Boston-based publishing company) published &quot;For Esmé&quot; as part of the anthology &quot;Nine Stories&quot;. The same anthology was published in 1953 in London by Hamish Hamilton under the title &quot;For Esmé—with Love and Squalor: and other stories&quot;.

In 1954, the BBC attempted to purchase the rights to turn &quot;For Esmé&quot; into a radio drama series, but Salinger declined.

In 1959, Harborough Publishing (London) issued a paperback edition of &quot;For Esme&quot; that featured Esme as a &quot;dishy blonde&quot; on the cover. Salinger disapproved of this edition so emphatically that he never spoke to his UK publisher again.

Since its original publication, &quot;For Esmé&quot; has been translated into many languages, including German, Swedish, Japanese, Spanish, and Polish.

==In popular culture==
Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s track &quot;I Fought in a War&quot; on their album &quot;Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant&quot; is inspired by the atmosphere in the story.

In of the series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, the main characters are sent to live with a couple named Esmé and Jerome Squalor.

==Abandoned film version==

In 1963, film and TV director Peter Tewksbury approached Salinger about making a film version of the story. Salinger agreed, on condition that he himself cast the role of Esmé. He had in mind for the role Jan de Vries, the young daughter of his friend, the writer Peter de Vries. However, by the time that Salinger and Tewksbury had settled on the final version of the script, Jan had turned eighteen and was considered by Salinger to be too old for the part. The film was never made.

<doc id="1180564" wikidata="Q6980821" url="?curid=1180564" title="Naturalization Act of 1798">
<text>The Naturalization Act of 1798 (, enacted June 18, 1798) was a law passed by the United States Congress, to amend the residency and notice periods of the previous Naturalization Act of 1795. It increased the period necessary for aliens to become naturalized citizens in the United States from 5 to 14 years and the Declaration of Intention from 3 to 5 years.

Although the law was passed under the guise of protecting national security, most historians conclude it was really intended to decrease the number of citizens, and thus voters, who disagreed with the Federalist Party. At the time, most immigrants supported Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, the political rivals of the Federalists. It had only limited effect, however, as many immigrants rushed to become naturalized before the Act went into effect, and states could at the time make their own more lenient naturalization laws.

The Act was controversial at the time, even within the Federalist Party, as many Federalists feared it would discourage immigration. It was repealed in 1802 by the Naturalization Law of 1802, which restored the residency and notice period of the previous Naturalization Act of 1795.

A number of changes were made to the previous naturalization law:

The &quot;notice time&quot; refers to the period that immigrants had to wait after declaring their intent to become a citizen. The &quot;residence period&quot; refers to the period they had to live in the United States before they could become a citizen. The Naturalization Act of 1798 is considered one of the Alien and Sedition Acts, together with three other laws passed contemporaneously in 1798 (the Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Sedition Act). Like the Naturalization Acts of 1790 and 1795, the 1798 act also restricted citizenship to &quot;free white persons&quot;.

The act is the first to maintain records of immigration and residence, and provided certificates of residence for white immigrant aliens, for the purpose of establishing the date of arrival for subsequent qualification for citizenship.

<text>Commander Harold Auten (22 August 1891 – 3 October 1964) was a Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) officer who was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received his medal for an action during the English Channel campaign of the First World War.

A former pupil of Wilson&#x27;s School, Wallington, London, Auten had joined the RNR before the outbreak of the First World War during which he served in Q-ships. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1917 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross &quot;for services in Vessels of the Royal Navy employed on Patrol and Escort duty&quot; in that year.

==Citation ==
He was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 following an action when he was commanding a Q-ship, HMS &quot;Stock Force&quot;:
(Note: the &quot;panic party&quot; was a group of the crew who would pretend to &quot;abandon ship&quot; when a Q-ship was attacked.)

Auten&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display at the Royal Naval Museum, in Portsmouth, England.

==Later work==
Harold Auten wrote &quot;Q Boat Adventures&quot;, the first book on Q-ships in 1919.

After the war he became an executive vice-president of the Rank Organisation in New York and lived for thirty years in Bushkill, Pennsylvania, where he owned a hotel and cinema. However, he remained a member of the RNR and in 1941 he was awarded the Royal Naval Reserve Officers Decoration.

During World War II, he held the rank of Commander (later acting Captain) in the RNR and served as senior staff organizing trans-Atlantic convoys. He was made an Officer of the United States Legion of Merit &quot;for distinguished service to the Allied cause throughout the war&quot; and a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau &quot;for service to the Royal Netherlands Navy during the War&quot;. He was a Younger Brother of Trinity House.

<doc id="1180580" wikidata="Q485070" url="?curid=1180580" title="Siksika Nation">
<text>The Siksika Nation (; ) is a First Nation in southern Alberta, Canada. The name &quot;Siksiká&quot; comes from the Blackfoot words &quot;sik&quot; (black) and &quot;iká&quot; (foot), with a connector &quot;s&quot; between the two words. The plural form of &quot;Siksiká&quot; is &quot;Siksikáwa&quot;. The &quot;Siksikáwa&quot; are the northernmost of the &quot;Niitsítapi&quot; (Original People), all of whom speak dialects of Blackfoot, an Algonquian language.

When European explorers travelled west, they most likely met the &quot;Siksiká&quot; first. The four &quot;Niitsítapi&quot; nations of the Blackfoot Confederacy are the &quot;Siksiká&quot;, &quot;Káínaa&quot; (Kainai or Blood), &quot;Aapátohsipikáni&quot; (Northern Peigan), and &quot;Aamsskáápipikani&quot; (South Peigan or Montana Blackfoot). The population of the Siksika Nation is approximately 7,800 people.

==Economic and social stimulus==

===Siksika Resource Development Limited ===
The Siksika nations economic authority is the Siksika Resource Development Limited (SRDL) founded in 1997. They manage a diverse group of enterprises and properties.

SRDL applied for a licence to produce Medical Marijuana in April 2016. They anticipate generating $15M in annual revenue. The Siksika Resource Development Ltd, and Siksika Herbz Ltd, and Frozen Penguin Ltd of Kelowna BC partnership plan to construct 25,000 Sq ft facility on the Siksika Nation. Revenue generated will also be donated to support social services.

The Siksika intend to distribute the medication domestically and internationally. Revenue from the venture is intended to address disparaging economic issues such as Opioid addiction epidemic, and housing. As of 2020 the proposal is still under review. Frozen Penguin will use modern technology and techniques such as &#x27;RotoGro&#x27;, to maximize profits for the nation.

On July 16, 2022. SRDL partnered with &#x27;Calgary Tree Planting Team&#x27; volunteers to plant 300 Sakskatoon berry trees near the &quot;Siksika business Plaza&quot;. The initiative will increase food security and provide economic growth for the Nation.

===Siksika Family Services Corporation/Siksika Children&#x27;s Services ===

The Siksika Family Services was awarded a grant by the Provincial and Federal governments &#x27;Rapid Housing Initiative&#x27;, to establish a transitional 24 housing unit community for Siksika&#x27;s vulnerable high need families and youth in the process of cultural reunification. The community will be called &quot;Children&#x27;s Village&quot;.

==Location==
The Siksika Nation reserve, Siksika 146, is located approximately east of Calgary, and south of the Trans Canada Highway (Highway 1). Its administrative and business district is located adjacent to the community of Gleichen.

Siksika Nation is the second largest, land-based, in Canada. Siksika Nation Boundaries of Blackfoot Confederacy Traditional Territory. 
North-North Saskatchewan River, West – Rock Mountains, East-At the confluence of the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers and South-Yellowstone River.

==Land claims==

The Siksika Nation has had a longstanding land claim dispute with the Government of Canada over events dating back to 1910. The government sought the cession of approximately of land within the Siksika Indian Reserve for sale by the federal government to incoming settlers. The cession included of reserve lands to be transferred to the Canadian Pacific Railway, for construction of the Bassano Dam. The band members were not adequately informed about this portion and lost the use of the surface rights of the land. The Nation claims the transfer was done illegally. In 1980, the government admitted that no proof existed that Canadian Pacific had acquired the rights to the land for the dam.

The Nation entered into negotiations with the Canadian government to settle the land claim. In 1991, the Siksika Nation signed a $4.9m agreement with the government for compensation for mineral rights lost due to construction of the dam. In 2010, the Nation finally reached agreement with the governments of Canada and Alberta to settle the land claims. The band would receive $50 million and new water rights. The money will be put in a trust to benefit the Nation for purposes such as education and welfare.

===2021 Global Settlement Agreement===
A six decade process of land claims commenced in 1960 under the leadership of Siksika Chief Clarence McHugh in 1959. McHugh stated “They told us they would give us a bag of money which would never empty, but somehow, that bag developed a great big hole.” In reference to the late Minister of the Interior, Frank Oliver 
who was instrumental in the disembowelment of 289,897 acres of First Nation&#x27;s territorial integrity throughout his career. He advised First Nations to cede/surrender treaty territory throughout Canada in exchange for frequently reneged Federal concessions or coersion such as denial of necessities such as food. He told the Siksika: &quot;It might be better to sell what they do not use for a big bag of money, which could give them money for ever and ever!&quot;. Chief McHugh described the surrendering as &#x27;“They cut our reserve up like a Christmas turkey and wasted our money.” A reporter described the dwellings of the Siksika as being &quot;ramshackle, uninsulated houses without foundations, with cracks and broken windows, patched up with rags and cardboard&quot; and Chief McHugh described the houses built after the initial sale in 1912 as &quot;almost falling apart&quot;.

In December 2021, Siksika members voted in a referendum to ratify the &quot;Global Settlement Agreement&quot;, 3,484 turned out to vote and of them 77% (2,682 people) voted for ratification. A comprehensive resolution followed, resolving multiple land claims and associated grievances which included a one-time payment of 1.3 Billion dollars and entitlement to purchase 115,000 acres of land from willing sellers which had previously been illegally obtained from the tribe through the so-called &quot;1910 Surrender&quot;.

On June 2, 2022, in a ceremony at the Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park, the Canadian government and the Siksika Nation signed the &quot;Global Settlement Agreement&quot;. The conclusion of a 60 year process of ongoing negotiations to redress the numerous land claims of previous illegal annexations and settlement of 115,000 acres (465.4 kmsq) of productive agricultural, ceremonial, and mineral reserve territory and the non-payment of mineral royalties following the &quot;1910 Surrender&quot;.

$20,000 was given to each band member and to essential services for the community such as improving education, infrastructure, and mental health services. As well as to fund a permanent police force for the reservation.

<doc id="1180584" wikidata="Q934827" url="?curid=1180584" title="Sir Fenton Aylmer, 13th Baronet">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, 13th Baronet, (5 April 1862 – 3 September 1935) was an Anglo-Irish British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross. He was in command of the first failed efforts to break the siege of Kut in 1916. From a military background, Aylmer was commissioned into the Indian Army, and immediately involved in fierce fighting on the north-west frontier. In a singularly heroic action, still in his twenties, he helped rescue Townshend&#x27;s garrison at Chitral, spearheading the relief column. For his valorous conduct he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and rapid promotion through the officer class.

==Early career==
Born the son of Captain Fenton John Aylmer and Isabella Eleanor Darling. Aylmer attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a Gentleman Cadet, in the same class as Reginald Wingate, and was promoted lieutenant on 27 July 1880. He took part in the Burma expedition between 1886 and 1887.

==Victoria Cross==
Fenton was 29 years old, and a captain in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army and Bengal Sappers &amp; Miners (British Indian Army), during the Hunza–Nagar Campaign, India when he won the Victoria Cross in 1891 for the following deed:
He was promoted major on 18 October 1893 in recognition of his services during the Hunza-Nagar Expedition, and was part of the Chitral Expedition in 1895. Further service with the Royal Engineers saw him promoted a brevet Lieutenant-colonel. In July 1901 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster general in India, and promoted to the substantive rank of colonel. Ten years later, in March 1912, having been promoted to major-general, he became Adjutant-General, India.

In 1913 he married Lady Risley, the widow of Sir Herbert Hope Risley, head of the Indian Civil Service. She was born Elsie Julie Oppermann, daughter of Friedrich Oppermann.

==First World War==

Having been promoted to lieutenant general on 11 June 1915, Aylmer was sent to Mesopotamia to take over command of the 7th (Meerut) Division. However, shortly after his arrival, he was put in charge of the Tigris Corps that was assembled as the first effort to end the siege of Kut. Tigris Corps comprised the Meerut Division, the 12th Indian Division, and a number of other smaller military units. All told he had more than 20,000 men. They left Basra in late December 1915 and arrived at Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad on 3 January 1916. While the 12th Indian Division (under command of General George Gorringe) made a diversionary move near Nasiriyeh, the 7th (under the command of General Younghusband) staged a direct assault on the Ottoman positions on 6 January (the Battle of Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad). After two days of fighting, the Ottoman army withdrew. The British sustained approximately 4,000 casualties – much more than the medical units could cope with. The Ottoman troops, under the generalship of Baron von der Goltz only withdrew some six miles up river and occupied another defensive position near the edge of the Suwaikiya Marshes. A British assault on this position on 13 January was partially successful, the position was carried but again with significant losses (some 1,600 casualties) (the Battle of Wadi).

By now, a third division had been added to Aylmer&#x27;s Tigris Corps, the 3rd (Lahore) Division. This new division, along with the weakened 7th Division, attacked Ottoman defensive works at Hanna on 21 January (the Battle of Hanna). This assault was a complete failure. The Ottoman troops held their trench lines while some 2,700 British soldiers were killed or wounded.

General Aylmer was reinforced with another division, the 13th (Western) Division. The next month was spent resting the troops and probing the Ottoman defensive positions. With time running out on Major-General Townshend&#x27;s garrison in Kut, Aylmer finally launched a two pronged attack on the Ottoman positions, one attack at the Sinn Abtar Redoubt, the other attack at the Dujaila Redoubt. The attacks were launched on 7 March 1916. Both attacks failed due to lack of initiative and an inability to coordinate the timing of the assaults: they ended up being sequential, not simultaneous as was intended. The British lost some 4,000 casualties.

Fenton Aylmer was replaced by the former commander of the 12th Indian division, Major-General Gorringe. He did not command in battle again, but served as a divisional commander in India from 1915 to 1917 before retiring from the British Army in 1919.

==Final years==
From 1922 till his death he was a colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers. 

Following his death in 1935 he was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, where his ashes remain.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent, England.

<doc id="1180589" wikidata="Q4120253" url="?curid=1180589" title="Paveway IV">
<text>Paveway IV is a dual mode GPS/INS and laser-guided bomb manufactured by Raytheon UK (formerly Raytheon Systems Limited). It is the latest iteration of the Paveway series.

The weapon is a guidance kit based on the existing Enhanced Paveway II Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG) added to a modified Mk 82 general-purpose bomb with increased penetration performance. The new ECCG contains a Height of Burst (HOB) sensor enabling air burst fusing options, and a SAASM (Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module) compliant GPS receiver. It can be launched either IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) only, given sufficiently good Transfer Alignment, or using GPS guidance. Terminal laser guidance is available in either navigation mode.

==History==
The Paveway IV entered service with the Royal Navy in 2008. 

The Paveway IV&#x27;s first export sale was to the Royal Saudi Air Force in a deal worth approximately £150 million (US $247 million). The deal had been delayed for several years by the U.S. State Department which had to authorise the bomb&#x27;s sale due to its use of American components. A contract was signed in December 2013 with Congressional approval given two months later, with deliveries to begin within 18 months.

The Paveway IV was first used operationally by the Royal Navy during Operation Herrick in Afghanistan. It was later used operationally during Operation Ellamy in Libya, and Operation Shader in Iraq and Syria. In December 2015, the Royal Air Force began strike operations in Syria as part of Operation Shader, and deployed Paveway IV operationally from its Eurofighter Typhoons for the first time.

In January 2015, Eurofighter Typhoons of the Royal Saudi Air Force dropped Paveway IVs on ISIL targets in Syria. This was the first operational deployment of Paveway IV from Typhoon.

Paveway IVs were also used in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In 2015 for a period export licences were withheld over concern about how they might be used in Yemen, but after some assurances were made exports were resumed. The sales were investigated by the Committees on Arms Export Controls. In December 2016, the Obama administration blocked a transfer of Paveway IV bombs to Saudi Arabia because of concerns about civilian casualties which officials put down to poor targeting.

Raytheon UK is conducting preparatory work to equip the Paveway IV with a bunker-busting warhead as part of the Selective Precision Effects At Range (Spear) Capability 1 program. The compact penetrator has the same outer mold line and mass of the regular Paveway IV and uses a discarding shroud design. A penetrating Paveway IV would replace the RAF&#x27;s previous Paveway III bunker buster. The penetrating version of the Paveway IV will enter service on the Typhoon in early 2019. Raytheon claims the new warhead has the performance of the BLU-109 penetrating bomb, despite being one-quarter of its weight. 
On 19 June 2015, a Royal Air Force test pilot released two inert Paveway IV laser-guided bombs from a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II during trials in the United States. This marked the first successful firing of a non-US munition during the F-35&#x27;s development programme. Paveway IV is a future candidate for integration on the aircraft, and will be used operationally by both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy when the F-35 enters service with both arms.

During the 2024 missile strikes in Yemen by a US-led coalition, Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons used Paveway IV bombs to strike Houthi rebels.

<text>Lectures on the Philosophy of History, also translated as Lectures on the Philosophy of World History (LPH; , VPW), is a major work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), originally given as lectures at the University of Berlin in 1822, 1828, and 1830. It presents world history in terms of the Hegelian philosophy in order to show that history follows the dictates of reason and that the natural progress of history is due to the outworking of absolute spirit.

The text was originally published in 1837 by the editor Eduard Gans, six years after Hegel&#x27;s death, utilizing Hegel&#x27;s own lecture notes as well as those found that were written by his students. A second German edition was compiled by Hegel&#x27;s son, Karl, in 1840. A third German edition, edited by Georg Lasson, was published in 1917.

==Themes==

===Written history===
Hegel begins by distinguishing three methods or modes of doing history: Original History, Reflective History and Philosophical History. To Original and Philosophic histories, Hegel assigns a single definition; on Reflective History, Hegel offers four sub-definitions. 

Original history is like that of Herodotus and Thucydides, these are almost contemporaneous writings limited to deeds, events and states of society which they had before their very eyes and whose culture they shared. Hegel posits the goal of Original history to transfer &quot;what was passing in the world around them, to the realm of representative intellect. An external phenomenon is thus translated into an internal conception. In the same way, the poet operates upon the material supplied him by his emotions; projecting it into an image for the conceptive faculty.&quot;

Reflective history is written at some temporal distance from the events or history considered. However, for Hegel, this form of history has a tendency to impose the cultural prejudices and ideas of the historians&#x27; era upon the history over which the historian reflects. 

Philosophical history for Hegel, is the true way. Hegel maintains that with philosophical history the historian must bracket his own preconceptions and go and find the overall sense and the driving ideas out of the very matter of the history considered.

===Spirit===
Hegel&#x27;s lectures on the philosophy of world history are often used to introduce students to Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, in part because Hegel&#x27;s sometimes difficult style is muted in the lectures, and he discourses on accessible themes such as world events in order to explain his philosophy. Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing &quot;Geist&quot; or spirit. The &quot;Geist&quot; is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the &quot;cunning of reason&quot; (&quot;List der Vernunft&quot;). In the lectures, Hegel claims that cultural awareness of &quot;Geist&quot; originated in ancient Judaism; he thus ties his history of &quot;Geist&quot; to a narrative of disenchantment and a decline in pagan polytheism. Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history. Thinkers such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) had written on the concept and importance of world history and nationalism, and Hegel&#x27;s philosophy continues this trend, while breaking away from an emphasis on nationalism and striving rather to grasp the full sweep of human cultural and intellectual history as a manifestation of spirit.

===Theodicy===
Hegel explicitly presents his lectures on the philosophy of history as a theodicy, or a reconciliation of divine providence with the evils of history. This leads Hegel to consider the events of history in terms of universal reason: &quot;That world history is governed by an ultimate design, that it is a rational process... this is a proposition whose truth we must assume; its proof lies in the study of world history itself, which is the image and enactment of reason.&quot; The ultimate design of the world is such that absolute spirit, here understood as God, comes to know itself and fully become itself in and through the triumphs and tragedies of history. Hegel is clear that history does not produce happiness - &quot;history is not the soil in which happiness grows. The periods of happiness in it are the blank pages of history&quot;; &quot;History as the slaughter-bench&quot; (&quot;Geschichte als Schlachtbank&quot;) - and yet the aims of reason are accomplished. Hegel writes: &quot;we must first of all know what the ultimate design of the world really is, and secondly, we must see that this design has been realized and that evil has not been able to maintain a position of equality beside it.&quot; To see the reason in history is to be able to account for the evil within it. He argued against the &#x27;professional historians&#x27; of the day such as Ranke. Hegel points out that the understanding and consequently writing of history always relies on a framework. Hegel chose to openly admit and explain his framework rather than hide it as many historians choose to do.

===History===
According to Hegel, &quot;World history... represents the development of the spirit&#x27;s consciousness of its own freedom and of the consequent realization of this freedom.&quot;. This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them. Hegel&#x27;s account of history begins with ancient cultures as he understood them. His account of the civilizations relied upon 19th century European scholarship, and contains an unavoidable Eurocentric bias. At the same time, the developmental nature of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy meant that rather than simply deprecating ancient civilizations and non-European cultures, he saw them as necessary (if incomplete or underdeveloped) steps in the outworking of absolute spirit. Hegel&#x27;s lectures on the philosophy of history contain one of his most well-known and controversial claims about the notion of freedom:

World history is the record of the spirit&#x27;s efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that One is free... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the Greeks, and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that Some, and not all men as such, are free... The Germanic nations, with the rise of Christianity, were the first to realize that All men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.
In other words, Hegel maintains that the consciousness of freedom in history moves from despotism, to a sense that freedom is a privilege of a few, to a robust notion that humanity is free in and of itself. Hegel believes that the spirit of human freedom is best nurtured within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch embodies the spirit and desires of the governed, and his reading of history locates the rise of such forms of government in the Germanic nations of, for example, the United Kingdom and Prussia after the Protestant Reformation. Hegel&#x27;s &quot;one, some, and all&quot; proposition follows the basic geographical metaphor Hegel takes throughout his philosophy of history, namely, &quot;World history travels from east to west; for Europe is the absolute end of history, just as Asia is the beginning.&quot; When referring to the east, Hegel generally has in mind the historical cultures of Persia, though at times he does reference China and spends a great deal of space discussing India and Indian religions. 
However, he has also said that any view of history (including his own) should be open to change based on the &#x27;empirical facts&#x27; available.

==The text==

===German editions===
Because of the nature of the text (collections of edited lecture notes), critical editions were slow in forthcoming. The standard German edition for many years was the manuscript of Hegel&#x27;s son Karl Hegel, published in 1840. The German edition produced by Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Michel (1986) essentially follows Karl Hegel&#x27;s edition. The only critical edition in German of the text of the lectures is Georg Lasson&#x27;s 4 vol. edition (1917–1920). This edition was published repeatedly (last in two volumes in 1980) by Felix Meiner Verlag, Hamburg. The long introduction was re-edited on the basis of Lasson&#x27;s publication in 1955, by Johannes Hoffmeister.

===English editions===
No full English translation of the complete lectures has ever been produced. The first English translation was made from Karl Hegel&#x27;s edition, which lacked much material discovered later. This translation, made by John Sibree (1857), is still the only English version which contains not only the Introduction, but the shorter body of the lectures according to Karl Hegel&#x27;s 1840 manuscript. Though it is incomplete, this translation is often used by English speaking scholars and is prevalent in university classrooms in the English-speaking world.

An English translation of the Introduction to the lectures was produced by Robert S. Hartman (1953) which included an introduction and additional editorial footnotes. Hartman produced this translation before Hoffmeister&#x27;s critical edition was published, and it is quite short, only 95 pages.

An English translation of Hoffmeister&#x27;s critical edition of the Introduction was produced in 1974 by H. B. Nisbet. This edition presents the full text of the Introduction to Karl Hegel manuscript, as well as all later additions included in the Hoffmeister edition of the Introduction. As such, it is the only critical edition of any portion of the lectures available in English. No translation of the full edition of the lectures following Lasson has yet been produced.

A new translation of the entirety of the &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; was published in 2011, translated by Ruben Alverado, based on the edition published by Friedrich Brünstad in 1907. This edition makes use of the original Sibree translation, checked against the edition by Philipp Reclam of Stuttgart, published in 1961, and of Suhrkamp Verlag, published in 1970.

<text>Stunt Car Racer (published as Stunt Track Racer in the United States) is a racing video game developed by Geoff Crammond. It was published in 1989 by MicroProse, under their MicroStyle and MicroPlay labels in the United Kingdom and in the United States, respectively. The game pits two racers on an elevated track on which they race in a head-to-head competition, with ramps they must correctly drive off as the main obstacle.

The game was released to critical acclaim. The Commodore 64 version&#x27;s use of 3D vector graphics was met with critical enthusiasm, which was unusual for a game for that platform. It is considered one of the better racing games and games for Amiga, with many calling it one of the best such games.

==Gameplay==
The game differs from other racing games in that the races take place on an elevated race track, with nothing to stop the player from accidentally driving off the side. Most race tracks in the game have gaps in them, which players can fall into. If this occurs then the player&#x27;s vehicle is hoisted back onto the track (by a nearby crane), costing valuable time. Turbo can be used to make a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race.

The single-player game consists of a league table which is split into four divisions of three drivers each, making a total of twelve racers including the human player. There are two racing tracks in each division making it a total of eight tracks in the game. The tracks in division four (the first division) are easy, but the tracks get progressively more difficult and dangerous with each division. The player&#x27;s objective is to reach, and subsequently win, division one. There are four races in a season, and each driver will race the other two drivers in both of the tracks in the division. Each race is run over three laps. Two points are awarded to the winner of each race and one point is awarded to the racer with the fastest lap time. At the end of each season, the top racer of each division is promoted to the next higher division while the driver in last place will be relegated.

Damage to the player&#x27;s car occurs when the player lands too hard on the track after driving over a crest too fast, crashes into a wall, falls into a gap in the track, or hits the opponent&#x27;s car. If the damage, which is indicated by a crack in the frame at the top of the screen, reaches a certain level, the vehicle is deemed to be wrecked and the driver loses the race instantly. A particularly hard crash will also make holes representing structural damage appear in the frame above the windshield. Holes remain on the car for the rest of the season and increase the rate at which the crack in the frame advances.

The player can compete against computer opponents or, at least on the Atari ST and Amiga versions, with another player using two computers connected via a null modem cable, each with their own TV or monitor. Such direct head-to-head racing between players is also made possible by pairing an Amiga computer with an Atari ST computer via the cable.

==Development and release==
British developer Geoff Crammond spent three years developing &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot;, his second car-based title after &quot;Revs&quot; in 1984. The project started off as a land-roving simulator for Commodore 64 where one drives on randomly undulating terrain. The physics were then programmed for the car&#x27;s suspension, and after testing the game himself, Crammond found driving off ramps the most enjoyable. He then added in more ramps on an even stretch of the landscape, but had difficulty locating them. He therefore placed the ramps on a track, which he then elevated to avoid driving onto the field. The track&#x27;s corners were banked to emphasize the game&#x27;s speed and the ramps as its main challenge. It was suggested after a magazine interview with Crammond that he was inspired by the arcade game &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot;, but he said that he had seen it only in the final months of his game&#x27;s development and that it had no impact on its outcome.

Visually, the difference between the 8-bit and Amiga and Atari ST releases is that the latter use a system for plotting polygons instead of a solid fill technique. Another key difference is that besides racing head-to-head on two linked computers, an Amiga can be connected to an Atari ST computer via the same RS-232 serial port on both machines for cross-platform play, owing to Crammond&#x27;s experience with outputting data for his other game, &quot;Aviator&quot;, on the BBC Micro. MicroProse considered adding up to eight concurrent racers and an editor for creating tracks, but ruled in favor of head-to-head racing and against the latter because doing either would have caused the gameplay to suffer severe stutters. The ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC ports of &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot; were programmed by Pete Cooke, and the DOS version was programmed by Tim Ansell. The Commodore 64 version was later modified for use without a keyboard. This version was in the Power Play cartridge together with &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; and &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot;, released for the C64 Games System. The last platforms to be ported to were the Amiga and the Atari ST, both programmed by Crammond. A port of &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot; for the Atari Jaguar was rumored to be in development, but it was never released.

A long-awaited sequel, &quot;Stunt Car Racer Pro&quot;, was announced in April 2003, but it never came to fruition.

==Reception==
The Commodore 64, Amstrad, Amiga, and Atari ST versions of the game received critical acclaim. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; was particularly enthusiastic about the Commodore 64 version. In its review, it lauded the game&#x27;s concept and the quality of its 3D vector graphics. One of its reviewers, though preferring to race against more than a single opponent directly, called it the most remarkable Commodore 64 program. &quot;ACE&quot; magazine, who was equally enthusiastic, also extolled the version&#x27;s vector graphics and the speed at which they are loaded as unparalleled in Commodore 64 gaming. &quot;Commodore Computing International&quot; also praised the use of vector graphics on a brand of computer not well recognised for its library of decent 3D games, as well as the controls and the difficulty, and described the game as a hybrid of &quot;Hard Drivin&quot;″ and &quot;Power Drift&quot;, with a few ideas of its own. &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; defined it as a &quot;truly stunning racing sim&quot; and one of the best ever on Amstrad CPC. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; felt the color selection used for the Amstrad port was gaudy and that with the tracks being of the same colour as the ground and their banked corners lacking shading, distinguishing the road from the ground could be troublesome, but praised its addictive, &quot;hair-raising&quot; gameplay.

In comparison, reviews for the Spectrum and DOS ports were generally favorable. &quot;Crash&quot; praised the graphics and the entertainment, but criticised the limiting number of tracks. On the DOS side, &quot;Zero&quot; lamented the port&#x27;s lack of track detail and limited color palette, but otherwise found that it still had the pace and gameplay that was as exhilarating as the Amiga and ST versions. &quot;Joystick&quot; praised the animation, but thought that the landscape was bland.

Editors of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; voted &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot; as the 1989 game of the year. &quot;ACE&quot; listed it as one of the five greatest racing games of all time and &quot;Top Gear&quot; the 45th best racing game. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;, &quot;CU Amiga&quot;, and &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; ranked it respectively the 10th, the 11th, and the 85th best game of all time for the platforms they covered, and &quot;Amiga Format&quot; likewise named it one of the 15 best Amiga games. Several publications consider it to be one of the greatest video games of all time; &quot;Edge&quot; listed it as the 54th best game in 2000, &quot;Stuff&quot; the 77th in 2008, and &quot;Polygon&quot; the 355th in 2017.

<text>James Hillman (April 12, 1926 – October 27, 2011) was an American psychologist. He studied at, and then guided studies for, the C.G. Jung Institute in Zürich. He founded a movement toward archetypal psychology and retired into private practice, writing and traveling to lecture, until his death at his home in Connecticut.

==Early life and education==
Hillman was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1926. He was the third child of four born to Madeleine and Julian Hillman. James was born in Breakers Hotel, one of the hotels his father owned. His maternal grandfather was Joseph Krauskopf, a rabbi in the Reform Judaism movement, who emigrated to the United States from Prussia. After high school, he studied at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service for two years. He served in the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps from 1944 to 1946, after which he attended the University of Paris, studying English Literature, and Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a degree in mental and moral science in 1950. He began his career as associate editor for the Irish literary review, &quot;Envoy&quot;. In 1953 he moved to Switzerland where he met Carl Gustav Jung and began to study his work. He also met there and became friends with the maverick young Swiss doctor and psychotherapist, Adolf Guggenbühl-Craig. In 1959, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich, as well as his analyst&#x27;s diploma from the C. G. Jung Institute, and was then appointed as the director of studies at the institute, a position he held until 1969.

==Career==
In 1970, Hillman became editor of Spring Publications, a publishing company devoted to advancing Archetypal Psychology as well as publishing books on mythology, philosophy and art. His magnum opus, &quot;Re-visioning Psychology&quot;, was written in 1975 and nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Hillman then helped co-found the Dallas Institute for Humanities and Culture in 1978. His 1997 book, &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Code: In Search of Character and Calling&quot;, was on The New York Times Best Seller List that year. His works and ideas about philosophy and psychology have also been popularized by other authors such as the psychotherapist Thomas Moore. His published works, essays, manuscripts, research notes, and correspondence (through 1999) reside at OPUS Archives and Research Center, located on the campuses of Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California.

Hillman was married three times, lastly to Margot McLean-Hillman, who survived him. He has four children from his first marriage. He died at his home in Thompson, Connecticut, in 2011, from bone cancer.

==Archetypal psychology==

Archetypal psychology is a polytheistic psychology, in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and myths that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. The ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies. To illustrate the multiple personifications of psyche Hillman made reference to gods, goddesses, demigods and other imaginal figures which he referred to as sounding boards &quot;for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of daily life&quot; although he insisted that these figures should not be used as a &#x27;master matrix&#x27; against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness. Archetypal psychology is part of the Jungian psychology tradition and related to Jung&#x27;s original Analytical psychology but is also a radical departure from it in some respects.

Whereas Jung’s psychology focused on the Self, its dynamics and its constellations (ego, anima, animus, shadow), Hillman’s Archetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the ego and focuses on &quot;psyche&quot;, or soul, and the &quot;archai&quot;, the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, &quot;the fundamental fantasies that animate all life&quot;

In &quot;Re-Visioning Psychology&quot; (1975) Hillman sketches a brief lineage of archetypal psychology:

By calling upon Jung to begin with, I am partly acknowledging the fundamental debt that archetypal psychology owes him. He is the immediate ancestor in a long line that stretches back through Freud, Dilthey, Coleridge, Schelling, Vico, Ficino, Plotinus, and Plato to Heraclitus – and with even more branches yet to be traced. (p. xvii)
The development of archetypal psychology is influenced by Carl Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology and Classical Greek, Renaissance, and Romantic ideas and thought. Hillman’s influences include Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Henry Corbin, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus, who share a common concern for &quot;psyche&quot;.

Hillman in turn influenced a number of younger Jungian analysts and colleagues, among the most well known being the popular author Thomas Moore (spiritual writer) and Jungian analyst Stanton Marlan. Some of the early history of this influence is traced in Marlan&#x27;s &quot;Archetypal Psychologies&quot;.

===Psyche or soul===

Hillman has been critical of the 20th century’s psychologies (e.g., biological psychology, behaviorism, cognitive psychology) that have adopted a natural scientific philosophy and praxis. The main criticisms include that they are reductive, materialistic, and literal; they are psychologies without &quot;psyche&quot;, without soul. Accordingly, Hillman&#x27;s work has been an attempt to restore &quot;psyche&quot; to what he believes to be &quot;its proper place&quot; in psychology. Hillman sees the soul at work in imagination, fantasy, myth and metaphor. He also sees soul revealed in psychopathology, in the symptoms of psychological disorders. Psyche-pathos-logos is the &quot;speech of the suffering soul&quot; or the soul&#x27;s suffering of meaning. A great portion of Hillman’s thought attempts to attend to the speech of the soul as it is revealed via images and fantasies.

&quot;Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account&quot; (2006) was written in 1981 as a chapter in the &quot;Enciclopedia del Novecento&quot; in Italy and published by Hillman in 1983 as a basic introduction to his mythic psychology. It summarizes the major themes set out in his earlier, more comprehensive work, &quot;Re-Visioning Psychology&quot; (1975). The poetic basis of mind places psychological activities in the realm of images. It seeks to explore images rather than explain them. Within this is the idea that by re-working images, that is giving them attention and shaping and forming them until they are clear as possible then a therapeutic process which Hillman calls &quot;soul making&quot; takes place. Hillman equates the psyche with the soul and seeks to set out a psychology based without shame in art and culture. The goal is to draw soul into the world via the creative acts of the individual, not to exclude it in the name of social order. The potential for soulmaking is revealed by psychic images to which a person is drawn and apprehends in a meaningful way. Indeed, the act of being drawn to and looking deeper at the images presented creates meaning – that is, soul. Further to Hillman&#x27;s project is a sense of the dream as the basic model of the psyche. This is set out more fully in &quot;The Dream and the Underworld&quot; (1979). In this text Hillman suggests that dreams show us as we are; diverse, taking very different roles, experiencing fragments of meaning that are always on the tip of consciousness. They also place us inside images, rather than placing images inside us. This move turns traditional epistemology on its head. The source of knowing is not Descartes&#x27; &quot;I&quot; but, rather, there is a world full of images that this &#x27;I&#x27; inhabits. Hillman further suggests a new understanding of psychopathology. He stresses the importance of psychopathology to the human experience and replaces a medical understanding with a poetic one. In this idea, sickness is a vital part of the way the soul of a person, that illusive and subjective phenomenon, becomes known.

===Dream analysis===

Because archetypal psychology is concerned with fantasy, myth, and image, dreams are considered to be significant in relation to soul and soul-making. Hillman does not believe that dreams are simply random residue or flotsam from waking life (as advanced by physiologists), but neither does he believe that dreams are compensatory for the struggles of waking life, or are invested with “secret” meanings of how one should live, as did Jung. Rather, “dreams tell us where we are, not what to do” (1979). Therefore, Hillman is against the traditional interpretive methods of dream analysis. Hillman’s approach is phenomenological rather than analytic (which breaks the dream down into its constituent parts) and interpretive/hermeneutic (which may make a dream image “something other” than what it appears to be in the dream). His famous dictum with regard to dream content and process is “Stick with the image.”

For example, Hillman (1983a) discusses a patient&#x27;s dream about a huge black snake. The dream work would include &quot;keeping the snake&quot; and describing it rather than making it something other than a snake. Hillman notes:the moment you&#x27;ve defined the snake, interpreted it, you&#x27;ve lost the snake, you&#x27;ve stopped it and the person leaves the hour with a concept about my repressed sexuality or my cold black passions ... and you&#x27;ve lost the snake. The task of analysis is to keep the snake there, the black snake...see, the black snake&#x27;s no longer necessary the moment it&#x27;s been interpreted, and you don&#x27;t need your dreams any more because they&#x27;ve been interpreted.One would inquire more about the snake as it is presented in the dream by the psyche so to draw it forth from its lair in the unconscious. The snake is huge and black, but what else? Is it molting or shedding its skin? Is it sunning itself on a rock? Is it digesting its prey? This descriptive strategy keeps the image alive, in Hillman&#x27;s opinion, and offers the possibility for understanding the psyche.

==&quot;The Soul&#x27;s Code&quot;==
Hillman&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Code: In Search of Character and Calling&quot;, outlines what he calls the &quot;acorn theory&quot; of the soul. This theory states that all people already hold the potential for the unique possibilities inside themselves, much as an acorn holds the pattern for an oak tree. The book describes how a unique, individual energy of the soul is contained within each human being, displayed throughout their lifetime and shown in their calling and life&#x27;s work when it is fully actualized.

Hillman argues against the &quot;nature and nurture&quot; explanations of individual growth, suggesting a third kind of energy, the individual soul which is responsible for much of individual character, aspiration and achievement. He also argues against other environmental and external factors as being the sole determinants of individual growth, including the parental fallacy, dominant in psychoanalysis, whereby our parents are seen as crucial in determining who we are by supplying us with genetic material, conditioning, and behavioral patterns. While acknowledging the importance of external factors in the blossoming of the seed, he argues against attributing all of human individuality, character and achievement to these factors. The book suggests reconnection with the third, superior factor, in discovering our individual nature and in determining who we are and our life&#x27;s calling.

Hillman suggests a reappraisal for each individual of their own childhood and present life to try to find their particular calling, the seed of their own acorn. He has written that he is to help precipitate a re-souling of the world in the space between rationality and psychology. He complements the notion of growing up, with the notion of growing down, or &#x27;rooting in the earth&#x27; and becoming grounded, in order for the individual to further grow. Hillman incorporates logic and rational thought, as well as reference to case histories of well known people in society, whose daimons are considered to be clearly displayed and actualized, in the discussion of the &quot;daimon&quot;. His arguments are also considered to be in line with the puer aeternus or eternal youth whose brief burning existence could be seen in the work of romantic poets like Keats and Byron and in recently deceased young rock stars like Jeff Buckley or Kurt Cobain. Hillman also rejects causality as a defining framework and suggests in its place a shifting form of fate whereby events are not inevitable but bound to be expressed in some way dependent on the character of the soul of the individual. He also talked about the bad seed using Hitler, Charles Manson and other serial killers as examples.

== Criticism==
From a classical Jungian perspective, Hillman&#x27;s Archetypal Psychology is a contrarian school of thought, since he has applied Occam&#x27;s razor to a few of what he refers to as unnecessary theoretical encumbrances of Jungian psychology. The term &quot;archetypal&quot; gives the impression that his school is based on Jung&#x27;s understanding of the archetype. Yet, Walter Odajnyk argues that Hillman should have called his school &quot;imaginal&quot; psychology, since it is really based on Hillman&#x27;s understanding of the imagination. Hillman has also rejected individuation, central to Jungian psychology. Wolfgang Giegerich argues that Hillman&#x27;s work exists in a &quot;bubble of irreality&quot; outside time. It&#x27;s a form of &quot;static Platonism&quot; impervious to developmental change. In Hillman&#x27;s psychology, the &quot;immunisation of the imaginal from the historical process has become inherent in its very form.&quot;

Hillman considers his work as an expression of the &quot;puer aeternus&quot;, the eternal youth of fairy tale who lives in an eternal dream-state, resistant to growing up. Yet, David Tacey maintains that denial of the maturational impulse will only lead to it happening anyway but in a negative form. He holds that Hillman&#x27;s model was &quot;unmade&quot; by the missing developmental element of his thought: &quot;By throwing out the heroic pattern of consciousness, and the idea of individuation, Hillman no longer appealed to most psychologists or therapists. By transgressing professional ethics, he no longer appealed to training institutes.&quot;

Marie-Louise von Franz regards identification with the &quot;puer aeternus&quot; as a neurosis belonging to the narcissistic spectrum. Against this, Hillman has argued that the &quot;puer&quot; is not under the sway of a mother complex but that it is best seen in relation to the &quot;senex&quot; or father archetype. However, Tacey says that the &quot;puer&quot; cannot be dissociated from the mother by intellectual reconfiguration. “If these figures are archetypally bound, why would intellectual trickery separate them?” The wrenching of the &quot;puer&quot; from the mother to the father is “a display of intellectual deceit, for a self-serving purpose.”

<text>Yefim &quot;Fimi&quot; Naumovich Bronfman (; born April 10, 1958) is a Soviet-born Israeli-American pianist.

==Biography==
Bronfman was born in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, and immigrated to Israel at the age of 15. He was born into a musical Jewish family. His father Naum Bronfman was a concertmaster of the municipal opera orchestra, his mother Pauline Bronfman was a pianist, and his older sister Elizabeth later became a violinist with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. He became an American citizen in 1989.

Bronfman&#x27;s teachers were Arie Vardi, Rudolf Firkušný, Leon Fleisher, and Rudolf Serkin. He made his international debut in 1975 with Zubin Mehta and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

He made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1989 and gave a series of recitals with Isaac Stern in 1991. He won a Grammy award in 1997 for his recording of the three Bartók piano concertos with Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Another recording with Salonen, of the concertos of Sergei Rachmaninoff, was pirated by the record label Concert Artist and re-issued with the piano part falsely attributed to Joyce Hatto.

Bronfman is also devoted to chamber music and has performed with many chamber ensembles and instrumentalists.

He made a set of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s complete sonatas and concertos (with Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) for Sony Records.

In 1999, he appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, in a short clip introducing the &quot;Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; segment. His rendition of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in F major (1st movement) with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra is the music used for the segment.

In March 2006, Bronfman performed Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich.

Bronfman has also made appearances with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, performing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto.

His recent appearances have included performances with the Orchestre de Paris and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra; Bronfman has also appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra in 2005 and again in 2007. In January 2007, he also premiered Esa-Pekka Salonen&#x27;s Piano Concerto, of which he is the dedicatee, with the New York Philharmonic conducted by the composer. This was later followed by a European premiere at The Proms with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In May 2008, Bronfman performed Johannes Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 1 with Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony, during a three-week Brahms Festival. On September 3, 2008, Bronfman performed Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor by Rachmaninoff under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas at the Opening Gala of the San Francisco Symphony, and on September 28 and 29 with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of David Robertson. On March 25 and 26, 2009, he performed it yet again, this time under the baton of Pinchas Zukerman with the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Bronfman performed Brahms&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto with the Houston Symphony Orchestra March 12–15, 2009, under the baton of Maestro Hans Graf, resident Music Director. In September 2021, he played Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor by Rachmaninoff with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Maestro Lahav Shani at the George Enescu Festival in Bucharest.

==Cultural references==
In &quot;The Human Stain&quot; by Philip Roth, the narrator attends a rehearsal at Tanglewood at which Bronfman performs. The following description is offered (pages 209–10):Then Bronfman appears. Bronfman the brontosaur! Mr. Fortissimo. Enter Bronfman to play Prokofiev at such a pace and with such bravado as to knock my morbidity clear out of the ring. He is conspicuously massive through the upper torso, a force of nature camouflaged in a sweatshirt, somebody who has strolled into the Music Shed out of a circus where he is the strongman and who takes on the piano as a ridiculous challenge to the gargantuan strength he revels in. Yefim Bronfman looks less like the person who is going to play the piano than like the guy who should be moving it. I had never before seen anybody go at a piano like this sturdy little barrel of an unshaven Russian Jew. When he&#x27;s finished, I thought, they&#x27;ll have to throw the thing out. He crushes it. He doesn&#x27;t let that piano conceal a thing. Whatever&#x27;s in there is going to come out, and come out with its hands in the air. And when it does, everything there out in the open, the last of the last pulsation, he himself gets up and goes, leaving behind him our redemption. With a jaunty wave, he is suddenly gone, and though he takes all his fire off with him like no less a force than Prometheus, our own lives now seem inextinguishable. Nobody is dying, &quot;nobody&quot;—not if Bronfman has anything to say about it.

<text>Albert Ball, (14 August 1896 – 7 May 1917) was a British fighter pilot during the First World War. At the time of his death he was the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading flying ace, with 44 victories, and remained its fourth-highest scorer behind Edward Mannock, James McCudden, and George McElroy.

Born and raised in Nottingham, Ball joined the Sherwood Foresters at the outbreak of the First World War and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in October 1914. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) the following year, and gained his pilot&#x27;s wings on 26 January 1916. Joining No. 13 Squadron RFC in France, he flew reconnaissance missions before being posted in May to No. 11 Squadron, a fighter unit. From then until his return to England on leave in October, he accrued many aerial victories, earning two Distinguished Service Orders and the Military Cross. He was the first ace to become a British national hero.

After a period on home establishment, Ball was posted to No. 56 Squadron, which deployed to the Western Front in April 1917. He died when his plane crashed into a field in France on 7 May, sparking a wave of national mourning and posthumous recognition, which included the award of the Victoria Cross for his actions during his final tour of duty. The famous German flying ace Manfred von Richthofen remarked upon hearing of Ball&#x27;s death that he was &quot;by far the best English flying man&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Albert Ball was born on 14 August 1896 at a house on Lenton Boulevard in Lenton, Nottingham. After a series of moves throughout the area, his family settled at &quot;Sedgley&quot; in Lenton Road. His parents were Albert Ball, a successful businessman who rose from employment as a plumber to become Lord Mayor of Nottingham, and who was later knighted, and Harriett Mary Page. Albert had two siblings, a brother and a sister. His parents were considered loving and indulgent. In his youth, Ball had a small hut behind the family house where he tinkered with engines and electrical equipment. He was raised with a knowledge of firearms, and conducted target practice in &quot;Sedgley&quot;&#x27;s gardens. Possessed of keen vision, he soon became a crack shot. He was also deeply religious. This did not curb his daring in such boyhood pursuits as steeplejacking; on his 16th birthday, he accompanied a local workman to the top of a tall factory chimney and strolled about unconcerned by the height.

Ball studied at the Lenton Church School, The King&#x27;s School, Grantham and Nottingham High School before transferring to Trent College in January 1911, at the age of 14. As a student he displayed only average ability, but was able to develop his curiosity for things mechanical. His best subjects were carpentry, modelling, violin and photography. He also served in the Officers&#x27; Training Corps. When Albert left school in December 1913, aged 17, his father helped him gain employment at Universal Engineering Works near the family home.

== First World War ==

=== Initial war service ===
Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Ball enlisted in the British Army, joining the 2/7th (Robin Hood) Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment). Soon promoted to sergeant, he gained his commission as a second lieutenant on 29 October. He was assigned to training recruits, but this rear-echelon role annoyed him. In an attempt to see action, he transferred early the following year to the North Midlands Cyclist Company, Divisional Mounted Troops, but remained confined to a posting in England. On 24 February 1915, he wrote to his parents, &quot;I have just sent five boys to France, and I hear that they will be in the firing line on Monday. It is just my luck to be unable to go.&quot;

In March 1915, Ball began a short-lived engagement to Dorothy (Dot) Elbourne. In June, he decided to take private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).

Ball would wake at 3:00 am to ride his motorcycle to Ruffy-Baumann for flying practice at dawn, before beginning his daily military duty at 6:45 am. His training at Ruffy-Baumann was not unique; Edwin Cole was learning to fly there at the same time. In letters home Ball recorded that he found flying &quot;great sport&quot;, and displayed what Peter de la Billière described as &quot;almost brutal&quot; detachment regarding accidents suffered by his fellow trainees:
=== Military flight training and reconnaissance work ===

Although considered an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no. 1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested transfer to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No. 9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In the first week of December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman &quot;Longhorn&quot; after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.

On 18 February 1916, Ball joined No. 13 Squadron RFC at Marieux in France, flying a two-seat Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c on reconnaissance missions. He survived being shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 27 March. Three days later, he fought the first of several combats in the B.E.2; he and his observer, Lieutenant S. A. Villiers, fired a drum and a half of Lewis gun ammunition at an enemy two-seater, but were driven off by a second one. After this inconclusive skirmish, Ball wrote home in one of his many letters, &quot;I like this job, but nerves do not last long, and you soon want a rest&quot;. In letters home to his father, he discouraged the idea of his younger brother following him into the RFC. Ball and Villiers tried unsuccessfully to shoot down an enemy observation balloon in their two-seater on 10 April. Ball&#x27;s burgeoning skills and aggressiveness gained him access to the squadron&#x27;s single-seat Bristol Scout fighter later that month. April 1916 also saw Ball&#x27;s first mention in a letter home of plans for &quot;a most wonderful machine ... heaps better than the Hun Fokker&quot;. It is now generally believed that these &quot;plans&quot; were unconnected with the design of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1, with which he later became involved.

=== Initial fighter posting ===
On 7 May 1916, Ball was posted to No. 11 Squadron, which operated a mix of fighters including Bristol Scouts, Nieuport 16s, and Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b &quot;pushers&quot;. After his first day of flying with his new unit, he wrote a letter home complaining about fatigue. He was unhappy with the hygiene of his assigned billet in the nearest village, and elected to live in a tent on the flight line. Ball built a hut for himself to replace the tent and cultivated a garden.

Throughout his flying service Ball was primarily a &quot;lone-wolf&quot; pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy&#x27;s fuselage. According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, &quot;it was quite a work of art to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, and at the same time manage one&#x27;s machine accurately&quot;. Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.

While flying a Bristol Scout on 16 May 1916, Ball scored his first aerial victory, driving down a German reconnaissance aircraft. He then switched to Nieuports, bringing down two LVGs on 29 May and a Fokker Eindecker on 1 June. On 25 June he became a balloon buster and an ace by destroying an observation balloon with phosphor bombs. During the month he had written to his parents admonishing them to try and &quot;take it well&quot; if he was killed, &quot;for men tons better than I go in hundreds every day&quot;. He again achieved two victories in one sortie on 2 July, shooting down a Roland C.II and an Aviatik to bring his score to seven.

Ball then requested a few days off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with No. 8 Squadron, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French espionage agent across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused to get out of the aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the &quot;London Gazette&quot; announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross &quot;for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions,&quot; particularly for &quot;one occasion [when] he attacked six in one flight&quot;. This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents &quot;I only scrap because it is my duty ... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, so I must do my duty best to make it a case of &quot;them&quot;&quot;.
Ball&#x27;s 20th birthday was marked by his promotion to temporary captain and his return to No. 11 Squadron. He destroyed three Roland C.IIs in one sortie on 22 August 1916, the first RFC pilot to do so. He ended the day by fighting 14 Germans some behind their lines. With his aircraft badly damaged and out of fuel, he struggled back to Allied lines to land. He transferred with part of No. 11 Squadron to No. 60 Squadron RFC on 23 August. His new commanding officer gave Ball a free rein to fly solo missions, and assigned him his own personal aircraft and maintenance crew. One of the squadron mechanics painted up a non-standard red propeller boss; A201 became the first of a series of Ball&#x27;s aeroplanes to have such a colour scheme. He found that it helped his fellow squadron members identify his aircraft and confirm his combat claims. By end of the month, he had increased his tally to 17 enemy aircraft, including three on 28 August.

Ball then took leave in England. His feats in France had received considerable publicity. He was the first British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such that he could not walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball&#x27;s achievements had a profound impact on budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom&#x27;s top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.

Upon return to No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored morning and evening victories on 15 September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his aircraft with eight Le Prieur rockets, fitted to the outer struts and designed to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by salvoing his rockets at them, then picked off one of the pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, Nieuport 17 A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the Colt automatic pistol that he habitually carried. Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain&#x27;s top-scoring ace. By this time he had told his commanding officer that he had to have a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of his nerves. On 3 October, he was sent on leave, en route to a posting at the Home Establishment in England. A French semi-official report of Ball&#x27;s successes was issued the same day; it was picked up and repeated in the British aviation journal &quot;Flight&quot; nine days later.

=== Home front ===
Ball had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and bar simultaneously on 26 September 1916. The first award was &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and skill&quot; when he took on two enemy formations. The bar was also &quot;for conspicuous skill and gallantry&quot; when he attacked four enemy aircraft in formation and then, on another occasion, 12 enemy machines. He was awarded the Russian Order of St. George the same month. Now that Ball had been posted back to England, he was lionised as a national hero with a reputation as a fearless pilot and expert marksman. A crowd of journalists awaited him on his family&#x27;s doorstep. In an interview, he mentioned being downed six times in combat. On 18 November, he was invested with his Military Cross and both DSOs by King George V at Buckingham Palace. A second bar to the DSO, for taking on three enemy aircraft and shooting one down, followed on 25 November, making him the first three-time recipient of the award. Ball was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant on 8 December 1916.
Instead of returning to combat after his leave, Ball was posted to instructional duties with No. 34 (Reserve) Squadron RFC, based at Orford Ness, Suffolk. About this time he was debriefed by flying instructor Philip Gribble, who was charged with discovering the tactics of ace fighter pilots; Gribble decided Ball operated on &quot;paramount courage and a bit of luck&quot;. Ball asked Gribble to let him try a Bristol Scout, which he landed badly, seriously damaging the undercarriage; Ball asked for another machine to try again, with the same result, after which he consoled himself by eating &quot;seven pounds of chocolate&quot;. It was while serving on the home front that he was able to lobby for the building and testing of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 fighter. He hoped to be able to take an example of the type to France with him, but the prototype was not completed until after his death in action. In November he was invited to test fly the prototype of the new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 single-seat scout, apparently the first service pilot to do so. He was unimpressed, finding the heavier, more stable fighter less responsive to the controls than the Nieuports he was used to. His negative assessment of other aspects of the S.E.&#x27;s performance, on the other hand, contrasted markedly with the reactions of fellow pilots who tested the prototype about this time. Ball was to maintain his opinion of the S.E. as a &quot;dud&quot;, at least until he had scored several victories on the type after his return to France.

On 19 February 1917, in a tribute from his native city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later reported his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No. 60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He invited her to fly with him, and she accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.

=== Second fighter posting ===

Inaction chafed Ball, and he began agitating for a return to combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No. 56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain&#x27;s aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No. 56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.

The latest type from the Royal Aircraft Factory, the S.E.5, had been selected to equip the new squadron. This choice was viewed with some trepidation by the RFC high command, and Ball himself was personally far from happy with the S.E.5. After some intense lobbying he was allowed to retain his Nieuport 17 no. B1522 when the unit went to France; the Nieuport was for his solo missions, and he would fly an S.E.5 on patrols with the rest of the squadron. This arrangement had the personal approval of General Hugh Trenchard, who went on to become the first Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Air Force. No. 56 Squadron moved to the Western Front on 7 April 1917. On arrival Ball wrote to his parents, &quot;Cheero, am just about to start the great game again&quot;.

S.E.5 no. A4850, fresh from its packing crate, was extensively modified for Ball: in particular he had the synchronised Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through the floor of the cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing the members of his flight nearby.

On 23 April 1917, Ball was under strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans five times in his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his preferred belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No. 56 Squadron&#x27;s first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport&#x27;s wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.

Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no. A4850, and one more on 28 April. This last day&#x27;s fighting left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot it out in a head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.

While squadron armourers and mechanics repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on his most recent S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6  May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball&#x27;s aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter&#x27;s aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron&#x27;s squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed to take part in the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote &quot;I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished&quot;.

=== Final flight and aftermath ===

On the evening of 7 May 1917, near Douai, 11 British aircraft from No. 56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from &quot;Jasta 11&quot;. A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered. Cecil Arthur Lewis, a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot;. Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron&#x27;s younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen, who eventually landed near Annœullin with a punctured fuel tank. Cyril Crowe observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud. A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant Hailer, then saw Ball&#x27;s plane falling upside-down from the bottom of the cloud, at an altitude of , with a dead prop.

Brothers Franz and Carl Hailer and the other two men in their party were from a German reconnaissance unit, &quot;Flieger-Abteilung A292&quot;. Franz Hailer noted, &quot;It was leaving a cloud of black smoke... caused by oil leaking into the cylinders.&quot; The engine had to be inverted for this to happen. The Hispano engine was known to flood its inlet manifold with fuel when upside down and then stop running. Franz Hailer and his three companions hurried to the crash site. Ball was already dead when they arrived. The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage. No bullet wounds were found on Ball&#x27;s body, even though Hailer went through Ball&#x27;s clothing to find identification. Hailer also took Ball to a field hospital. A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.
The Germans credited Richthofen with shooting down Ball, but there is some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen&#x27;s claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which is a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball&#x27;s death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. Ball&#x27;s squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as &quot;missing&quot; on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: &quot;Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory.&quot; It was only at the end of the month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed &quot;the English Richthofen&quot;, the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription &quot;Im Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger-Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps&quot; (&quot;Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball&quot;).

Ball&#x27;s death was reported worldwide in the press. He was lauded as the &quot;wonder boy of the Flying Corps&quot; in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot;, the &quot;Ace of English Aces&quot; in Portugal, the &quot;heroe aviador&quot; in South America, and the &quot;super-airman&quot; in France. On 7 June 1917, the &quot;London Gazette&quot; announced that he had received the Croix de Chevalier, &quot;Legion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; from the French government. The following day, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his &quot;most conspicuous and consistent bravery&quot; in action from 25 April to 6 May 1917. On 10 June 1917, a memorial service was held for Ball in the centre of Nottingham at St Mary&#x27;s Church, with large crowds paying tribute as the procession of mourners passed by. Among those attending were Ball&#x27;s father Albert, Sr. and brother Cyril, now also a pilot in the RFC; his mother Harriett, overwhelmed with grief, was not present. Ball was posthumously promoted to captain on 15 June. His Victoria Cross was presented to his parents by King George V on 22 July 1917. The following year he was awarded a special medal by the Aero Club of America.

=== Posthumous tributes ===

In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard released a seminal biography, &quot;Captain Ball VC&quot;, reprinting many of Ball&#x27;s letters and prefaced with encomiums by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that &quot;What he says in one of his letters, &#x27;I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now&#x27;, represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved&quot;. Haig spoke of Ball&#x27;s &quot;unrivalled courage&quot; and his &quot;example and incentive to those who have taken up his work&quot;. In Trenchard&#x27;s opinion, Ball had &quot;a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time&quot;.

In the book proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball&#x27;s most notable opponent, Manfred von Richthofen. The Red Baron, who believed in his younger brother&#x27;s victory award, considered Ball &quot;by far the best English flying man&quot;. Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, &quot;I see they have given him the V.C. Of course he won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that.&quot; The authors themselves described the story of Ball&#x27;s life as that of &quot;a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill at a time when all the world was killing... saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death&quot;.

Linda Raine Robertson, in &quot;The Dream of Civilised Warfare&quot;, noted that Briscoe and Stannard emphasised &quot;the portrait of a boy of energy, pluck, and humility, a loner who placed his skill in the service of his nation, fought—indeed, invited—a personal war, and paid the ultimate sacrifice as a result&quot;, and that they &quot;struggle to paste the mask of cheerful boyishness over the signs of the toll taken on him by the stress of air combat and the loss of friends&quot;.

Alan Clark, in &quot;Aces High: The War in the Air Over the Western Front&quot;, found Ball the &quot;perfect public schoolboy&quot; with &quot;the enthusiasms and all the eager intelligence of that breed&quot; and that these characteristics, coupled with a lack of worldly maturity, were &quot;the ingredients of a perfect killer, where a smooth transition can be made between the motives that drive a boy to &#x27;play hard&#x27; at school and then to &#x27;fight hard&#x27; against the King&#x27;s enemies&quot;. Biographer Chaz Bowyer considered that &quot;to label Albert Ball a &#x27;killer&#x27; would be to do him a grave injustice&quot;, as his &quot;sensitive nature suffered in immediate retrospect whenever he succeeded in combat&quot;.

== Post-war legacy ==

After the war the British discovered Ball&#x27;s grave, which had been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of No. 207 Squadron RAF erected a new cross in place of the one left by the Germans. The Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father&#x27;s request Ball&#x27;s grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball&#x27;s grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball&#x27;s is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German. Ball&#x27;s father also bought the French field where his son had died and erected a memorial stone on the crash site.

Memorials to Ball in his native Nottingham include a monument and statue in the grounds of Nottingham Castle. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription, consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite. The bronze group, by the sculptor Henry Poole, shows a life-size figure of Ball with an allegorical female figure at his shoulder. The monument was unveiled on 8 September 1921 by Air Marshal Trenchard, with military honours including a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft. In 1929 the bronze model for Ball&#x27;s statue was presented by his father to the National Portrait Gallery in London, where it is on display. In further remembrance of his son, Albert Ball, Sr. commissioned the building of the Albert Ball Memorial Homes in Lenton to house the families of local servicemen killed in action. The Lenton War Memorial, located in front of the homes, includes Ball&#x27;s name and was also paid for by the Ball family. The homes were Grade-II listed for historic preservation in 1995.
A memorial to Ball, along with his parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of the southwest corner of Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto &quot;Per Ardua ad Astra&quot;, along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball&#x27;s aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college&#x27;s library and chapel, respectively. One of the houses at Nottingham High&#x27;s Junior School is also named after Ball.

In 2006, Ball was one of six recipients of the Victoria Cross to be featured on a special commemorative edition of Royal Mail stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the award. In 2015, Ball was featured on a £5 coin (issued in silver and gold) in a six-coin set commemorating the Centenary of the First World War by the Royal Mint. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Nottingham Castle Museum along with his other medals and memorabilia, including a bullet-holed Avro windshield, a section of engine piping from one of his damaged Nieuports, his Freedom of Nottingham Scroll and Casket, and various letters and other papers. A portrait study by Noel Denholm Davis is in the collection of Nottingham City Museums and Galleries.

<text>Franciscus (&quot;Frans&quot;) Jozef Brüggen (30 October 1934 – 13 August 2014) was a Dutch conductor, recorder player and baroque flautist.

==Biography==
Born in Amsterdam, Brüggen was the youngest of the nine children of August Brüggen, a textile factory owner, and his wife Johanna (née Verkley), an amateur singer. He studied recorder and flute at the Amsterdam Muzieklyceum. He also studied musicology at the University of Amsterdam. In 1955, at the age of 21, he was appointed professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. His reputation was initially as a recorder and Baroque flute virtuoso, and he commissioned several works for recorder including Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Gesti&quot; (1965). In 1972, he co-founded the avant-garde recorder ensemble Sour Cream with Kees Boeke and Walter van Hauwe.

Brüggen introduced a flexibility of tone and rhythm to solo recorder playing that was novel to historically informed performance practice at the time. Notes in slow passages would be slightly bent for emotional affect, tone warmed and cooled, messa di voce employed, alongside considerable use of rubato. Such approaches provoked some controversy at the time, but in part due to his use of them, have since become more commonplace.

In 1981, Brüggen co-founded with Sieuwert Verster the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century (&quot;Orkest van de Achttiende Eeuw&quot;). Although he did not have a formal title with the orchestra, he was its &quot;de facto&quot; chief conductor until his death. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE) named Brüggen its co-principal guest conductor, in parallel with Simon Rattle, in 1992. The OAE later gave him the title of Emeritus Conductor in 2007. He was the conductor of the Radio Kamerorkest in the Netherlands from 1991 to 1994, and joint chief conductor of the orchestra, alongside Péter Eötvös, from 2001 until the dissolution of the orchestra in 2005. Brüggen conducted the final concert of the successor to the Radio Kamerorkest, the Netherlands Radio Chamber Orchestra, on 14 July 2013.

Brüggen was a visiting professor at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.

His recordings include, as a flautist, selections from the &quot;Pièces de Clavecin en Concerts&quot; of Jean-Philippe Rameau, and as a conductor, Instrumental Suites of Rameau&#x27;s operas (Dardanus, Les Boréales, Castor &amp; Pollux, Les Indes galantes, Naïs, Zoroastre, Les Fêtes d&#x27;Hébé, Acante et Céphise), symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert.

==Personal life==
Brüggen was married twice. His first marriage to Ineke Verwayen produced two daughters, Laura and Alicia. His second marriage was to the art historian Machtelt Israëls; they had two daughters, Zephyr and Eos. Brüggen was the uncle of recorder soloist and Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet member, Daniël Brüggen.

<text>Robert Alvin Von Hebb (July 26, 1938 – August 3, 2010) was an American R&amp;B and soul singer, musician, songwriter, recording and performing artist, best known for his 1966 hit &quot;Sunny&quot;.

==Biography==
Hebb was born in Nashville, Tennessee. His parents, William and Ovalla Hebb, were both blind musicians. Hebb and his older brother, Harold Hebb, performed as a song-and-dance team in Nashville beginning when Bobby was three and Harold was nine. Hebb performed on a TV show hosted by country music record producer Owen Bradley, which earned him a place with Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff. Hebb played spoons and other instruments in Acuff&#x27;s band. Harold later became a member of Johnny Bragg and the Marigolds. Bobby Hebb sang backup on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Diddley Daddy&quot;. Hebb played &quot;West-coast-style&quot; trumpet in a United States Navy jazz band, and replaced Mickey Baker in Mickey and Sylvia.

On November 23, 1963, the day after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Bobby Hebb&#x27;s brother, Harold, was killed in a knife fight outside a Nashville nightclub. Hebb was devastated by both events and sought comfort in songwriting. Though many claim that the song he wrote after both tragedies was the optimistic &quot;Sunny&quot;, Hebb himself stated otherwise. He immersed himself in the Gerald Wilson album &quot;You Better Believe It!&quot; for comfort.

&quot;Sunny&quot; was recorded in New York City after demos were made with the record producer Jerry Ross. Released as a single in 1966, &quot;Sunny&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 3 on the R&amp;B charts, and No. 12 in the United Kingdom. When Hebb toured with The Beatles in 1966 his &quot;Sunny&quot; was, at the time of the tour, ranked higher than any Beatles song then on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. BMI rated &quot;Sunny&quot; number 25 in its &quot;Top 100 songs of the century&quot;.

In 1976, Hebb released a newly recorded disco version entitled &quot;Sunny &#x27;76&quot;. The single was a minor hit reaching No. 94 on the R&amp;B chart.

Hebb also had lesser hits with his &quot;A Satisfied Mind&quot; in 1966 (No. 39 on the Billboard chart and No. 40 on the R&amp;B chart) and &quot;Love Me&quot; in 1967 (No. 84), and wrote many other songs, including Lou Rawls&#x27; 1971 hit &quot;A Natural Man&quot; (co-written with comedian Sandy Baron). Six years prior to &quot;Sunny&quot;, Hebb reached the New York City Top 50 with a remake of Roy Acuff&#x27;s &quot;Night Train to Memphis&quot;. In 1972, his single &quot;Love Love Love&quot; reached No. 32 on the UK charts.

After a recording gap of 35 years, Hebb recorded &quot;That&#x27;s All I Wanna Know&quot;, his first commercial release since &quot;Love Games&quot; for Epic Records in 1970. It was released in Europe in late 2005 by Tuition, a pop indie label. Two new duet versions of &quot;Sunny&quot; were issued, one with Astrid North and the other with Pat Appleton. In October 2008, he toured and played in Osaka and Tokyo in Japan.

<text>The Piikani Nation (, formerly the Peigan Nation) () is a First Nation (or an Indian band as defined by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;), representing the Indigenous people in Canada known as the Northern Piikani () or simply the Peigan ( or ).

==History==
Historically speaking the Blackfoot language and members of the Blackfoot Confederacy (), the Peigan people occupied territory before the 1870s on both sides of what is now the Canada–United States border. The Blackfoot Confederacy signed several treaties with the US and received the Great Northern Reservation, an initially vast reservation in present-day Montana. However, 220 Peigans were massacred by the US Army in 1870 and American authorities pressured the Blackfoot to give up more and more lands to settlers ( were ceded in 1887), leading some Peigans to relocate to Canada and sign Treaty 7 with the Canadian government in 1877.

The Peigan are now divided between the Blackfeet Nation ( or &quot;Southern Piikani&quot;) based on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, and the Piikani Nation ( or &quot;Northern Piikani&quot;) in Alberta.

The other members of the Confederacy are the Blackfoot-speaking or Blood and the or Blackfoot, as well as the or Sarcee who only became allied later and spoke an unrelated language. At the time the treaties were signed, the Northern Peigan were situated on the Oldman River, west of the future site of Lethbridge, to the west of the tribe.

With its headquarters in Brocket, Alberta, the Piikani Nation controls two parcels of land, Peigan Timber Limit &quot;B&quot; and the Piikani 147 Indian reserve (on which Brocket is located). the band had a registered population of 3,638 members, of whom 2,358 lived on Piikani Nation reserves. The band is a member of the Treaty 7 Management Corporation.

The Piikani Nation has a history of firsts. It was the first band in Alberta to demand a vote in provincial elections, the first to allow liquor onto a reserve, the first to assume administration of their reserve, and the first to host Indian Day Celebrations as a means of retaining and maintaining their culture. Education has been controlled by the band since 1986 when a high school was built on the reserve. This is managed by the Peigan Board of Education, a non-profit society registered under the &quot;Societies Act of Alberta&quot;, comprising six trustees elected at large by the band&#x27;s membership and one appointed by the band council. Scholarships and bursaries are provided by the Piikani Youth &amp; Education Foundation with monies from the Piikani Trust Agreement (see below).

The band is governed by a council comprising a chief and twelve councillors elected according to custom rather than the provisions of the Indian Act. To this end, in 2002, the Piikani Nation implemented the &quot;Piikani Nation Election By-law&quot; and &quot;Regulations&quot; (collectively referred to as the &quot;Election Code&quot;). This code includes a reference in its preamble to , the traditional teachings of the Piikani, and allows for councillors to be dismissed if they are found to be in violation of the tenets of .

A court case in 2008 also allowed for the principles of to be invoked to &quot;prevent&quot; a candidate from running from office, rather than to remove them once in office. The court found that the elders of the community functioned like a senate, and that they were the proper body to advise the Piikani Nation Election Removals Board and the Chief Electoral Officer. The court ruled that the Election Code did not include such powers for the elders as written, however, and so it gave the band six months to clarify the code.

The principles of were invoked once again when on December 13, 2013, Gayle Strikes With A Gun was removed as chief by the Piikani Nation Removal Appeals Board because she &quot;failed to maintain a standard of conduct expected of a member of the Piikani Nation Council, as set out in the Election Bylaws and in keeping with the principles of .&quot;

In 2002 the voters of Piikani Nation approved a $64.3 million settlement with the governments of Alberta and Canada over Piikani water rights impacted by the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation Headworks on the Oldman River. The monies were deposited in the Piikani Trust governed by the Piikani Trust Agreement. The agreement also allowed the Nation to acquire of new reserve land. The band later took out loans against the trust to invest in industrial developments, and were then sued by a band member alleging mismanagement. The band then filed suit against a Calgary-based investment broker for defrauding it of $23 million from the settlement. In 2012, the band&#x27;s investment company, Piikani Investment Corporation, was restructured in the bankruptcy courts. The alleged mismanagement became part of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation in 2013.

<text>Stochastic gradient descent (often abbreviated SGD) is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (e.g. differentiable or subdifferentiable). It can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the actual gradient (calculated from the entire data set) by an estimate thereof (calculated from a randomly selected subset of the data). Especially in high-dimensional optimization problems this reduces the very high computational burden, achieving faster iterations in exchange for a lower convergence rate.

The basic idea behind stochastic approximation can be traced back to the Robbins–Monro algorithm of the 1950s. Today, stochastic gradient descent has become an important optimization method in machine learning.

==Background==
Both statistical estimation and machine learning consider the problem of minimizing an objective function that has the form of a sum:
formula_1
where the parameter formula_2 that minimizes formula_3 is to be estimated. Each summand function formula_4 is typically associated with the formula_5-th observation in the data set (used for training).

In classical statistics, sum-minimization problems arise in least squares and in maximum-likelihood estimation (for independent observations). The general class of estimators that arise as minimizers of sums are called M-estimators. However, in statistics, it has been long recognized that requiring even local minimization is too restrictive for some problems of maximum-likelihood estimation. Therefore, contemporary statistical theorists often consider stationary points of the likelihood function (or zeros of its derivative, the score function, and other estimating equations).

The sum-minimization problem also arises for empirical risk minimization. There, formula_6 is the value of the loss function at formula_5-th example, and formula_3 is the empirical risk.

When used to minimize the above function, a standard (or &quot;batch&quot;) gradient descent method would perform the following iterations:
formula_9
The step size is denoted by formula_10 (sometimes called the &quot;learning rate&quot; in machine learning) and here &quot;formula_11&quot; denotes the update of a variable in the algorithm.

In many cases, the summand functions have a simple form that enables inexpensive evaluations of the sum-function and the sum gradient. For example, in statistics, one-parameter exponential families allow economical function-evaluations and gradient-evaluations.

However, in other cases, evaluating the sum-gradient may require expensive evaluations of the gradients from all summand functions. When the training set is enormous and no simple formulas exist, evaluating the sums of gradients becomes very expensive, because evaluating the gradient requires evaluating all the summand functions&#x27; gradients. To economize on the computational cost at every iteration, stochastic gradient descent samples a subset of summand functions at every step. This is very effective in the case of large-scale machine learning problems.

==Iterative method==
In stochastic (or &quot;on-line&quot;) gradient descent, the true gradient of formula_3 is approximated by a gradient at a single sample:
formula_13
As the algorithm sweeps through the training set, it performs the above update for each training sample. Several passes can be made over the training set until the algorithm converges. If this is done, the data can be shuffled for each pass to prevent cycles. Typical implementations may use an adaptive learning rate so that the algorithm converges.

In pseudocode, stochastic gradient descent can be presented as :
* Choose an initial vector of parameters formula_2 and learning rate formula_10.
* Repeat until an approximate minimum is obtained:
** Randomly shuffle samples in the training set.
** For formula_16, do:
*** formula_17

A compromise between computing the true gradient and the gradient at a single sample is to compute the gradient against more than one training sample (called a &quot;mini-batch&quot;) at each step. This can perform significantly better than &quot;true&quot; stochastic gradient descent described, because the code can make use of vectorization libraries rather than computing each step separately as was first shown in where it was called &quot;the bunch-mode back-propagation algorithm&quot;. It may also result in smoother convergence, as the gradient computed at each step is averaged over more training samples.

The convergence of stochastic gradient descent has been analyzed using the theories of convex minimization and of stochastic approximation. Briefly, when the learning rates formula_10 decrease with an appropriate rate,
and subject to relatively mild assumptions, stochastic gradient descent converges almost surely to a global minimum 
when the objective function is convex or pseudoconvex, 
and otherwise converges almost surely to a local minimum.
This is in fact a consequence of the Robbins–Siegmund theorem.

==Linear regression==
Suppose we want to fit a straight line formula_19 to a training set with observations formula_20 and corresponding estimated responses formula_21 using least squares. The objective function to be minimized is
formula_22
The last line in the above pseudocode for this specific problem will become:
formula_23Note that in each iteration or update step, the gradient is only evaluated at a single formula_24. This is the key difference between stochastic gradient descent and batched gradient descent.

In general, given a linear regression formula_25 problem, stochastic gradient descent behaves differently when formula_26 (underparameterized) and formula_27 (overparameterized). In the overparameterized case, stochastic gradient descent converges to formula_28. That is, SGD converges to the interpolation solution with minimum distance from the starting formula_29. This is true even when the learning rate remains constant. In the underparameterized case, SGD does not converge if learning rate remains constant.

==History==
In 1951, Herbert Robbins and Sutton Monro introduced the earliest stochastic approximation methods, preceding stochastic gradient descent. Building on this work one year later, Jack Kiefer and Jacob Wolfowitz published an optimization algorithm very close to stochastic gradient descent, using central differences as an approximation of the gradient. Later in the 1950s, Frank Rosenblatt used SGD to optimize his perceptron model, demonstrating the first applicability of stochastic gradient descent to neural networks.

Backpropagation was first described in 1986, with stochastic gradient descent being used to efficiently optimize parameters across neural networks with multiple hidden layers. Soon after, another improvement was developed: mini-batch gradient descent, where small batches of data are substituted for single samples. In 1997, the practical performance benefits from vectorization achievable with such small batches were first explored, paving the way for efficient optimization in machine learning. As of 2023, this mini-batch approach remains the norm for training neural networks, balancing the benefits of stochastic gradient descent with gradient descent.

By the 1980s, momentum had already been introduced, and was added to SGD optimization techniques in 1986. However, these optimization techniques assumed constant hyperparameters, i.e. a fixed learning rate and momentum parameter. In the 2010s, adaptive approaches to applying SGD with a per-parameter learning rate were introduced with AdaGrad (for &quot;Adaptive Gradient&quot;) in 2011 and RMSprop (for &quot;Root Mean Square Propagation&quot;) in 2012. In 2014, Adam (for &quot;Adaptive Moment Estimation&quot;) was published, applying the adaptive approaches of RMSprop to momentum; many improvements and branches of Adam were then developed such as Adadelta, Adagrad, AdamW, and Adamax.

Within machine learning, approaches to optimization in 2023 are dominated by Adam-derived optimizers. TensorFlow and PyTorch, by far the most popular machine learning libraries, as of 2023 largely only include Adam-derived optimizers, as well as predecessors to Adam such as RMSprop and classic SGD. PyTorch also partially supports Limited-memory BFGS, a line-search method, but only for single-device setups without parameter groups.

==Notable applications==
Stochastic gradient descent is a popular algorithm for training a wide range of models in machine learning, including (linear) support vector machines, logistic regression (see, e.g., Vowpal Wabbit) and graphical models. When combined with the back propagation algorithm, it is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard algorithm for training artificial neural networks. Its use has been also reported in the Geophysics community, specifically to applications of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI).

Stochastic gradient descent competes with the L-BFGS algorithm, which is also widely used. Stochastic gradient descent has been used since at least 1960 for training linear regression models, originally under the name ADALINE.

Another stochastic gradient descent algorithm is the least mean squares (LMS) adaptive filter.

==Extensions and variants==
Many improvements on the basic stochastic gradient descent algorithm have been proposed and used. In particular, in machine learning, the need to set a learning rate (step size) has been recognized as problematic. Setting this parameter too high can cause the algorithm to diverge; setting it too low makes it slow to converge. A conceptually simple extension of stochastic gradient descent makes the learning rate a decreasing function of the iteration number , giving a &quot;learning rate schedule&quot;, so that the first iterations cause large changes in the parameters, while the later ones do only fine-tuning. Such schedules have been known since the work of MacQueen on -means clustering. Practical guidance on choosing the step size in several variants of SGD is given by Spall.

===Implicit updates (ISGD)===
As mentioned earlier, classical stochastic gradient descent is generally sensitive to learning rate . Fast convergence requires large learning rates but this may induce numerical instability. The problem can be largely solved by considering &quot;implicit updates&quot; whereby the stochastic gradient is evaluated at the next iterate rather than the current one:
formula_30

This equation is implicit since formula_31 appears on both sides of the equation. It is a stochastic form of the proximal gradient method since the update
can also be written as:
formula_32

As an example, 
consider least squares with features formula_33 and observations
formula_34. We wish to solve:
formula_35
where formula_36 indicates the inner product.
Note that formula_37 could have &quot;1&quot; as the first element to include an intercept. Classical stochastic gradient descent proceeds as follows:
formula_38

where formula_5 is uniformly sampled between 1 and formula_40. Although theoretical convergence of this procedure happens under relatively mild assumptions, in practice the procedure can be quite unstable. In particular, when formula_10 is misspecified so that formula_42 has large absolute eigenvalues with high probability, the procedure may diverge numerically within a few iterations. In contrast, &quot;implicit stochastic gradient descent&quot; (shortened as ISGD) can be solved in closed-form as:
formula_43

This procedure will remain numerically stable virtually for all formula_10 as the learning rate is now normalized. Such comparison between classical and implicit stochastic gradient descent in the least squares problem is very similar to the comparison between least mean squares (LMS) and 
normalized least mean squares filter (NLMS).

Even though a closed-form solution for ISGD is only possible in least squares, the procedure can be efficiently implemented in a wide range of models. Specifically, suppose that formula_6 depends on formula_2 only through a linear combination with features formula_24, so that we can write formula_48, where formula_49 may depend on formula_50 as well but not on formula_2 except through formula_52. Least squares obeys this rule, and so does logistic regression, and most generalized linear models. For instance, in least squares, formula_53, and in logistic regression formula_54, where formula_55 is the logistic function. In Poisson regression, formula_56, and so on.

In such settings, ISGD is simply implemented as follows. Let formula_57, where formula_58 is scalar.
Then, ISGD is equivalent to:
formula_59

The scaling factor formula_60 can be found through the bisection method since in most regular models, such as the aforementioned generalized linear models, function formula_61 is decreasing, and thus the search bounds for formula_62 are formula_63.

===Momentum===
Further proposals include the &quot;momentum method&quot; or the &quot;heavy ball method&quot;, which in ML context appeared in Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams&#x27; paper on backpropagation learning and borrowed the idea from Soviet mathematician Boris Polyak&#x27;s 1964 article on solving functional equations. Stochastic gradient descent with momentum remembers the update at each iteration, and determines the next update as a linear combination of the gradient and the previous update:
formula_64
formula_65
that leads to:
formula_66

where the parameter formula_2 which minimizes formula_3 is to be estimated, formula_10 is a step size (sometimes called the &quot;learning rate&quot; in machine learning) and formula_70 is an exponential decay factor between 0 and 1 that determines the relative contribution of the current gradient and earlier gradients to the weight change.

The name momentum stems from an analogy to momentum in physics: the weight vector formula_2, thought of as a particle traveling through parameter space, incurs acceleration from the gradient of the loss (&quot;force&quot;). Unlike in classical stochastic gradient descent, it tends to keep traveling in the same direction, preventing oscillations. Momentum has been used successfully by computer scientists in the training of artificial neural networks for several decades.
The &quot;momentum method&quot; is closely related to underdamped Langevin dynamics, and may be combined with simulated annealing.

In mid-1980s the method was modified by Yurii Nesterov to use the gradient predicted at the next point, and the resulting so-called &quot;Nesterov Accelerated Gradient&quot; was sometimes used in ML in the 2010s.

===Averaging===
&quot;Averaged stochastic gradient descent&quot;, invented independently by Ruppert and Polyak in the late 1980s, is ordinary stochastic gradient descent that records an average of its parameter vector over time. That is, the update is the same as for ordinary stochastic gradient descent, but the algorithm also keeps track of

formula_72When optimization is done, this averaged parameter vector takes the place of .

===AdaGrad===
&quot;AdaGrad&quot; (for adaptive gradient algorithm) is a modified stochastic gradient descent algorithm with per-parameter learning rate, first published in 2011. Informally, this increases the learning rate for and decreases the learning rate for ones that are less sparse. This strategy often improves convergence performance over standard stochastic gradient descent in settings where data is sparse and sparse parameters are more informative. Examples of such applications include natural language processing and image recognition.

It still has a base learning rate , but this is multiplied with the elements of a vector which is the diagonal of the outer product matrix

formula_73

where formula_74, the gradient, at iteration . The diagonal is given by

formula_75This vector essentially stores a historical sum of gradient squares by dimension and is updated after every iteration. The formula for an update is now
formula_76
or, written as per-parameter updates,
formula_77
Each gives rise to a scaling factor for the learning rate that applies to a single parameter . Since the denominator in this factor, formula_78 is the &quot;ℓ&quot;2 norm of previous derivatives, extreme parameter updates get dampened, while parameters that get few or small updates receive higher learning rates.

While designed for convex problems, AdaGrad has been successfully applied to non-convex optimization.

===RMSProp===
&quot;RMSProp&quot; (for Root Mean Square Propagation) is a method invented in 2012 by James Martens and Ilya Sutskever, at the time both PhD students in Geoffrey Hinton&#x27;s group, in which the learning rate is, like in Adagrad, adapted for each of the parameters. The idea is to divide the learning rate for a weight by a running average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight. Unusually, it was not published in an article but merely described in a Coursera lecture.

So, first the running average is calculated in terms of means square,

formula_79

where, formula_80 is the forgetting factor. The concept of storing the historical gradient as sum of squares is borrowed from Adagrad, but &quot;forgetting&quot; is introduced to solve Adagrad&#x27;s diminishing learning rates in non-convex problems by gradually decreasing the influence of old data.

And the parameters are updated as,

formula_81

RMSProp has shown good adaptation of learning rate in different applications. RMSProp can be seen as a generalization of Rprop and is capable to work with mini-batches as well opposed to only full-batches.

===Adam===
&quot;Adam&quot; (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a 2014 update to the &quot;RMSProp&quot; optimizer combining it with the main feature of the &quot;Momentum method&quot;. In this optimization algorithm, running averages with exponential forgetting of both the gradients and the second moments of the gradients are used. Given parameters formula_82 and a loss function formula_83, where formula_84 indexes the current training iteration (indexed at formula_85), Adam&#x27;s parameter update is given by:

formula_86
formula_87

formula_88
formula_89

formula_90
where formula_91 is a small scalar (e.g. formula_92) used to prevent division by 0, and formula_93 (e.g. 0.9) and formula_94 (e.g. 0.999) are the forgetting factors for gradients and second moments of gradients, respectively. Squaring and square-rooting is done element-wise.

The initial proof establishing the convergence of Adam was incomplete, and subsequent analysis has revealed that Adam does not converge for all convex objectives. Despite this, &quot;Adam&quot; continues to be used due to its strong performance in practice.

==== Variants ====
The popularity of &quot;Adam&quot; inspired many variants and enhancements. Some examples include:

* Nesterov-enhanced gradients: &quot;NAdam&quot;, &quot;FASFA&quot;
* varying interpretations of second-order information: &quot;Powerpropagation&quot; and &quot;AdaSqrt&quot;.
* Using infinity norm: &quot;AdaMax&quot; 
* &quot;AMSGrad&quot;, which improves convergence over &quot;Adam&quot; by using maximum of past squared gradients instead of the exponential average. &quot;AdamX&quot; further improves convergence over &quot;AMSGrad&quot;.
* &quot;AdamW&quot;, which improves the weight decay.

===Sign-based stochastic gradient descent===
Even though sign-based optimization goes back to the aforementioned &quot;Rprop&quot;, in 2018 researchers tried to simplify Adam by removing the magnitude of the stochastic gradient from being taken into account and only considering its sign.
===Backtracking line search===
Backtracking line search is another variant of gradient descent. All of the below are sourced from the mentioned link. It is based on a condition known as the Armijo–Goldstein condition. Both methods allow learning rates to change at each iteration; however, the manner of the change is different. Backtracking line search uses function evaluations to check Armijo&#x27;s condition, and in principle the loop in the algorithm for determining the learning rates can be long and unknown in advance. Adaptive SGD does not need a loop in determining learning rates. On the other hand, adaptive SGD does not guarantee the &quot;descent property&quot; – which Backtracking line search enjoys – which is that formula_95 for all n. If the gradient of the cost function is globally Lipschitz continuous, with Lipschitz constant L, and learning rate is chosen of the order 1/L, then the standard version of SGD is a special case of backtracking line search.

===Second-order methods===
A stochastic analogue of the standard (deterministic) Newton–Raphson algorithm (a &quot;second-order&quot; method) provides an asymptotically optimal or near-optimal form of iterative optimization in the setting of stochastic approximation. A method that uses direct measurements of the Hessian matrices of the summands in the empirical risk function was developed by Byrd, Hansen, Nocedal, and Singer. However, directly determining the required Hessian matrices for optimization may not be possible in practice. Practical and theoretically sound methods for second-order versions of SGD that do not require direct Hessian information are given by Spall and others. (A less efficient method based on finite differences, instead of simultaneous perturbations, is given by Ruppert.) Another approach to the approximation Hessian matrix is replacing it with the Fisher information matrix, which transforms usual gradient to natural. These methods not requiring direct Hessian information are based on either values of the summands in the above empirical risk function or values of the gradients of the summands (i.e., the SGD inputs). In particular, second-order optimality is asymptotically achievable without direct calculation of the Hessian matrices of the summands in the empirical risk function. When the objective is a nonlinear least-squres loss
formula_96 
where formula_97 is the predictive model (e.g., a deep neural network)
the objective&#x27;s structure can be exploited to estimate 2nd order information using gradients only. The resulting 
methods are simple and often effective
== Approximations in continuous time ==
For small learning rate formula_98 stochastic gradient descent formula_99 can be viewed as a discretization of the gradient flow ODE

formula_100

subject to additional stochastic noise. This approximation is only valid on a finite time-horizon in the following sense: assume that all the coefficients formula_101 are sufficiently smooth. Let formula_102 and formula_103 be a sufficiently smooth test function. Then, there exists a constant formula_104 such that for all formula_105

formula_106

where formula_107 denotes taking the expectation with respect to the random choice of indices in the stochastic gradient descent scheme.

Since this approximation does not capture the random fluctuations around the mean behavior of stochastic gradient descent solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been proposed as limiting objects. More precisely, the solution to the SDE

formula_108

for formula_109 where formula_110 denotes the Ito-integral with respect to a Brownian motion is a more precise approximation in the sense that there exists a constant formula_104 such that

formula_112

However this SDE only approximates the one-point motion of stochastic gradient descent. For an approximation of the stochastic flow one has to consider SDEs with infinite-dimensional noise.

<text>The Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century () is a Dutch early music orchestra. Frans Brüggen and Lucy van Dael co-founded the orchestra in 1981. 
Sieuwert Verster became financial manager in 1984. Although he did not have a formal title with the orchestra, Brüggen served as the &quot;de facto&quot; principal conductor of the orchestra from its founding until his death in 2014. Verster has served as the orchestra&#x27;s manager since its founding.

As of August 2014, the orchestra consisted of 55 members, from many different countries, who all play on period instruments. The group was formed as a collective, so all orchestra members and the conductor receive equal shares of concert earnings. The orchestra does not audition its members, but receives them through word-of-mouth invitations.

The orchestra has toured widely both in Europe and America and recorded extensively with Philips Classics, including symphonies of Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart. In more recent years, the orchestra has recorded for the Glossa label.

<text>The bunny hug was a dancing style performed by young people, in the early 20th century. It is thought to have originated in San Francisco, California in the Barbary Coast dance halls along with the Texas Tommy, turkey trot, and grizzly bear.

The bunny hug was performed to the music of America&#x27;s great ragtime composers. The bunny hug, like other &quot;animal&quot; dances, caused a lot of uproar in polite society.

A song under the title &quot;The Bunny Hug&quot; with subtitle &quot;the Craze of the Day&quot;, composed by Harry Von Tilzer with lyrics by William Jerome, was released in 1912.

The 1913 Vitagraph comedy short &quot;Bunny Dips Into Society&quot; features scenes of comedian John Bunny performing the Bunny Hug; the film was also released under the title &quot;Bunny and the Bunny Hug&quot;.

<text>The Florida Ship Canal Company was a company founded in 1883 with hopes to build a proposed Cross Florida Canal.

The company was incorporated February 26, 1883 under Florida state law chapter 3486. Its stated purpose was:
:to survey, locate, construct, own, maintain, and operate and enjoy a Ship Canal and Telegraph Line, with all appropriate and necessary appurtenances across the peninsula of the State of Florida, which shall connect the waters of the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico, commencing at a point on the Atlantic coast at or between the bay and harbor at Fernandina and the bay and harbor of St. Augustine, thence by the most practicable and feasible route the said company may ascertain across said peninsula, terminating with the Gulf of Mexico at any point between Apalachee Bay and Tampa Bay and harbor, with the right to use and pass over any river, lake or other body of water on the route so selected for said canal, the same to be constructed with or without locks, as the company may determine.
A map of the route was to be filed in the office of the Florida Commissioner of Lands and Immigration within one year of the passage of the act.

The company was owned by: Townsend Cox, Wm. Fullerton, John H. Fry, L. M. Lawson, S. T. Meyer, Micheal Jacobs and David McAdam, of the City of New York; John C. Brown of Tennessee; Wm. Mahone, Wm. E. Cameron, A. W. Jones and V. D. Groner, of Virginia; John P. Jones, of Nevada; Benj. F Butler of Massachusetts; and W. H. Manning of Ohio.

<doc id="1180662" wikidata="Q2745292" url="?curid=1180662" title="Pocono Mountains">
<text>The Pocono Mountains, commonly referred to as the Poconos (), are a geographical, geological, and cultural region in Northeastern Pennsylvania. They overlook the Delaware River and Delaware Water Gap to the east, Lake Wallenpaupack to the north, Wyoming Valley and the Coal Region to the west, and the Lehigh Valley to the south. The name Pocono is derived from the Munsee word Pokawachne, which means &quot;Creek Between Two Hills&quot;.

Much of the Poconos region lies within the Greater New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA Combined Statistical Area. The wooded hills and valleys have long been a popular recreation area, accessible within a two-hour drive to millions of metropolitan area residents, with many Pocono communities having resort hotels with fishing, hunting, skiing, and other sports facilities.

Although referred to usually as a mountain range, the area is actually a dissected plateau, a sub-section of the larger Allegheny Plateau, forming a escarpment. The topological mountains are also a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains.

==Population==

The Pocono Mountains are a popular recreational destination. While the area has long been a popular tourist destination, many communities have seen a rise in population, especially communities within Monroe County and Pike County. The region has a population of about 340,300, which is growing at a rapid pace. The Poconos now serve as a commuter community for New York City and North Jersey. The commute to workplaces often takes as much as two hours each way due to traffic.

The region includes three major municipalities: Stroudsburg, East Stroudsburg, and Mount Pocono, all located in Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

==Municipalities and communities==

The Pocono Mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania are divided into six regions: the Mountain Region, the Lake Region, the Delaware River Region, the Upper Delaware River Region, Wyoming Valley, and the Lehigh River Gorge Region.

==Transportation==
===Roads===

The Poconos are served by many state highways. The most used of these highways include PA 115, PA 715, PA 903 (designated in some areas as the &quot;Highway to Adventure&quot; because of the numerous venues and resorts along the highway), Pennsylvania Route 33, Pennsylvania Route 940, and PA 611. PA 309, a major north–south route connecting Northeastern Pennsylvania with the Delaware Valley Region, passes through the western end of the region.

There are two U.S. highways in the Pocono Mountains Region. The more used is US 209, which goes from Ulster, New York, to Millersburg, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg. The route&#x27;s midpoint is in the region north of Stroudsburg. The other main U.S. Highway in the region is US 6, which is a transcontinental highway that starts near Bishop, California, and runs for over to its eastern terminus in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It is designated a scenic route in Pennsylvania. US 11, US 22, and US 46 are also not far from the region and serve it indirectly.

The main east–west interstate highway in the region is I-80, off which branches I-380, which connects the Poconos to Scranton. The other interstate highways in the region in I-476, the Pennsylvania Turnpike&#x27;s Northeast Extension, which has interchanges near Lehighton (Mahoning Valley), Albrightsville (Route 903), and White Haven (Pocono), and I-81, which serves as an alternate route for the much busier I-87 and I-95, particularly for travelers from Toronto, Syracuse, Binghamton and Montreal to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Other interstates that serve the region are I-84, which begins in Scranton and goes east to New England, and I-78, by way of Route 33 or Route 309.

===Restoration of passenger rail service===
NJ Transit is rebuilding trackage on the Lackawanna Cut-Off route from Scranton through the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey. There is no estimated target year when the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project will be completed to the Poconos. The service would consist of nine trains per day in each direction. In April 2022, the NJ Transit board approved a $32.5 million contract for improving a tunnel and restoring track to part of the line between Blairstown, New Jersey and Port Morris Junction, New Jersey, a segment in which trackage had been removed in the 1980s.

Until 1970, the Erie Lackawanna Railway operated long-distance trains through the Poconos to Buffalo and Chicago to the west, and Hoboken to the east; the last Erie Lackawanna train to run this routes was &quot;Lake Cities&quot;, which operated from 1939 to 1970.

===Air travel===
There are two airports that are located just outside the region: Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport and Lehigh Valley International Airport.

== Geography ==

The Pocono Mountains is a defined area encompassing portions of Carbon, Monroe, Pike, and southern Wayne Counties in Pennsylvania. In total, the Poconos encompasses over . Some definitions also extend the Poconos to Lackawanna, Luzerne, eastern Schuylkill, and Susquehanna Counties. The Poconos are geologically part of the Allegheny Plateau, like the nearby Catskills. The Poconos&#x27; highest summit, Big Pine Hill, reaches , while its lowest elevation is in Pike County.

The Delaware River flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to &quot;stream between two mountains&quot;. The Lehigh and Lackawaxen Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways.

==Climate==
===Glaciated Low Plateau region===
According to the Trewartha climate classification system, the Glaciated Low Plateau region of the northern and eastern Poconos has a Temperate Continental climate (&quot;Dc&quot;) with warm summers (&quot;b&quot;), cold winters (&quot;o&quot;) and year-around precipitation (&quot;Dcbo&quot;). &quot;Dcbo&quot; climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ≤ , four to seven months with an average mean temperature ≥ , all months with an average mean temperature &lt; and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although most summer days are comfortably humid on the Low Plateau, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values &gt; . Since 1981, the highest air temperature was on 08/06/2001, and the highest daily average mean dew point was on 08/01/2006. July is the peak month for thunderstorm activity which correlates with the average warmest month of the year. Since 1981, the wettest calendar day was on 09/17/2004. During the winter months, the plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . Since 1981, the coldest air temperature was on 01/21/1994.

Ice storms and large snowstorms depositing ≥ of snow occur nearly every year, particularly during nor’easters from December through March.

===Ridge and Valley region===
According to the Trewartha climate classification system, the Ridge and Valley section of the southern Poconos has a Temperate Continental climate (&quot;Dc&quot;) with hot summers (&quot;a&quot;), cold winters (&quot;o&quot;) and year-around precipitation (&quot;Dcao&quot;). &quot;Dcao&quot; climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ≤ , four to seven months with an average mean temperature ≥ , at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although most summer days are slightly humid in the Ridge and Valley, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values &gt; . Since 1981, the highest air temperature was on 07/22/2011, and the highest daily average mean dew point was on 08/01/2006. July is the peak month for thunderstorm activity which correlates with the average warmest month of the year. The average wettest month is September which correlates with tropical storm remnants during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Since 1981, the wettest calendar day was on 10/08/2005.

Ice storms and large snowstorms depositing ≥ of snow occur once every couple of years, particularly during nor’easters from December through March.

== Temperate Rainforest ==
The Pocono Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains in Pennsylvania also is an island of temperate rainforest with many areas averaging just over 55 inches of precipitation annually. A temperate rainforest is defined as a forest that has an average of at least 55 inches of precipitation annually and an average annual temperature between 4 and 12 degrees Celsius (39 and 54 degrees Fahrenheit). Some sources however claim even at least 50 inches of average annual precipitation qualifies an area to be a rainforest. Alaback also adds some additional criteria to the definition of a temperate rainforest as having at least 10% of its average annual precipitation during the summer months, cool and frequently overcast summers with average July temperature less than 16 degrees Celsius (60.8 degrees Fahrenheit), and forest fires or wildifres rare and do not play an important role in the forest ecosystem. And it must also be dense and lush with a rich understory and epiphytes.

== Ecology ==

===Glaciated Low Plateau region===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, the Glaciated Low Plateau region of the northern and eastern Poconos would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Hardwood (&quot;106&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Northern hardwood forest (&quot;26&quot;) north and west of Lake Wallenpaupack, and a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (&quot;104&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (&quot;25&quot;) south and east of Wallenpaupack. The peak spring bloom typically occurs in early-May and peak fall color usually occurs in early-October. The plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

===Glaciated Pocono Plateau region===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, the Glaciated Pocono Plateau region of the central and western Poconos would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Hardwood (&quot;106&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Northern hardwood forest (&quot;26&quot;). The peak spring bloom typically occurs in early-May and peak fall color usually occurs in early-October. The plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, the Ridge and Valley region of the southern Poconos would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (&quot;104&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (&quot;25&quot;). The peak spring bloom typically occurs in late-April and peak fall color usually occurs in mid-October. The plant hardiness zone is 6a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

==Sullivan march==
During the Revolutionary War in 1779, General John Sullivan marched his troops through the Pocono Mountains (Monroe and Luzerne counties) on their expedition to fight the Iroquois tribe in New York State. Sergeant Moses Fellows of the Third New Hampshire Regiment described the area as &quot;...very poor &amp; Barren and I think as never will Be Settled.&quot;

==Recreation==
The Poconos are a well-known outdoor recreation destination for residents around the northeast, especially from New York City and Philadelphia. The region encompasses the Delaware State Forest, including six designated natural areas, seven state parks, and seventeen state game lands. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area is on the eastern edge of the Poconos and includes of wilderness.

===Resorts===

Two of the earliest Pocono resorts were founded by rival factions of the Philadelphia Quaker community, Inn at Buck Hill Falls (1901) and Pocono Manor (1902). These resorts did not allow liquor or dancing, and evening dress was discouraged. The Quakers &quot;brought a quiet, unostentatious style to the region,&quot; but their hotels later developed from religious retreats into &quot;luxurious mountain resorts.&quot; Buck Hill&#x27;s stone facade became a model for close to 300 stately stone-and-shingle homes in the region.

Pocono Manor offered sweeping vistas of the eastern and western Pocono region and had been referred to as the &quot;Grand Lady of the Mountains&quot;. Buck Hill closed in 1990 and the Inn at Pocono Manor was mostly destroyed by fire in 2019.

Skytop Lodge, built in 1928, is described as a &quot;Dutch Colonial–style manor house&quot;. Designed in reaction to the Quaker resorts, it had a dance floor and served liquor in a basement bar. Skytop offers of hiking trails, and the main building &quot;is surrounded by of wood, glacial bogs, hemlock gorges, beaver marshes, and cascading waterfalls.&quot; Novelist Faith Baldwin wrote about her 1932 visit to Skytop, &quot;Here are friendly mountains, round-breasted, smiling in the clear, rosy light of dawn.&quot;

The Buckwood Inn opened in 1911 and included the first golf course to be designed by renowned golf architect A. W. Tillinghast. Bandleader Fred Waring purchased the resort in 1943, renamed it the Shawnee Inn, and broadcast his radio shows from there. The Shawnee Inn is a Spanish colonial revival building with white-Moorish architecture and Spanish tiled roofs, and it was identified in the 1990s as the only resort on the banks of the Delaware River.

Tamiment was a popular resort among Jewish singles from the working and emerging middle class and has been described as &quot;a progressive version of the Catskills...&quot; The facility opened in 1921 to generate income for the Rand School of Social Science, a Socialist school in New York. Tamiment Playhouse entertained resort guests with an original revue every Saturday night during the 10-week summer season, and many prominent Broadway and TV figures gained experience there. The playhouse was referred to as the &quot;Poconos boot camp for Broadway writers and performers.&quot; The revues were discontinued in 1960 and the resort closed down in 2005.

Unity House, a Pocono retreat, offered affordable vacations for factory workers. The resort was owned for seventy years by the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union, and it served as a staging ground for union activities. Ron Devlin of The Morning Call referred to Unity House as a &quot;blue-collar &#x27;Hilton.&#x27;&quot; Eleanor Roosevelt visited Unity House many times and wrote, &quot;...you could not put children in a more favorable environment...&quot; The resort closed down in 1990, falling victim to changing times and declining union membership.

In 1945 retired New York executive Rudolf Van Hoevenberg established the first honeymoon resort in the Pocono Mountains, Farm on the Hill. Sally Moore of &quot;Snow Country&quot; wrote, &quot;Far from today&#x27;s sybaritic accommodations, back then the rustic cabins required new brides to make the beds and tidy up while grooms helped with the dishes and did the heavy work.&quot;

By 1960, the Pocono Mountains rivaled Niagara Falls as a honeymoon destination, attracting 100,000 couples a year. Morris Wilkins, co-owner of Cove Haven, invented the heart-shaped bathtub in 1963 as a way to lure honeymoon customers.

The tub would appear in other couples resorts and became a symbol of the Pocono resort business. Author Lawrence Squeri wrote in 2002, &quot;If Americans today are asked to name the image that best represents the Poconos, chances are that many will cite couples resorts and heart-shaped bathtubs...&quot;

Mount Airy Lodge expanded from an eight-room inn into the largest Pocono resort. It heavily advertised in the New York media market with the catchy jingle, &quot;Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.&quot; Headliners, such as Bob Hope, Milton Berle, and Connie Francis, performed in the Crystal Room, Mount Airy&#x27;s 2,000-seat theater. Comedian Mickey Freeman said, &quot;The food was lousy, but it was a legalized orgy.&quot; The resort&#x27;s heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s before closing in 2001.

In the 1950s, the Kiesendahl family purchased a 12-bedroom boarding house along Lake Teedyuskung. It became the Woodloch Resort and, as of 2014, it encompassed and accommodated 900 guests in a variety of lodgings. Travel + Leisure identified the Lodge at Woodloch (founded 2006) as the number 3 destination spa in the world.

As of July 2015, there were four Pocono resorts with indoor water parks: Great Wolf Lodge, H20ooohh! at Split Rock Resort, Aquatopia at Camelback Mountain Resort, and Kalahari Resort. In 2014 Jayne Clark of USA Today wrote, &quot;The former Honeymoon Capital of the World, the Poconos – rebranded in 2007 as the Pocono Mountains – continues to fine-tune its image as a family-friendly outdoor adventureland, health spa getaway and emerging waterpark capital.&quot;

===Gambling===
In November 2006 the Pocono Downs (now Mohegan Pennsylvania) harness-racing complex opened the first slot-machine parlor in the state of Pennsylvania. It was owned by the Mohegan Indian Tribe of Connecticut and included two gambling floors with nearly 1,100 machines. The Mount Airy Casino Resort opened in October 2007 (on the site of the former Mount Airy Lodge) with about 2,500 slot machines. The owner, Louis DeNaples, was later charged with perjury due to suspected ties with organized crime figures. He turned the resort over to his daughter and avoided prosecution.

===Camping===
The Poconos are home to several Scout camps. Camp Minsi, owned by the Boy Scouts&#x27; Minsi Trails Council, is centrally located in the Poconos on a property of in Pocono Summit. Camp Mosey Wood, owned by the Girl Scouts&#x27; Eastern Pennsylvania council, is located on a property of in White Haven, Pennsylvania. Other Scout camps located in the Poconos include Goose Pond Scout Reservation (Lake Ariel), Resica Falls Scout Reservation (Marshalls Creek), and Trexler Scout Reservation (Jonas).

The Poconos are also home to several Jewish summer camps, including Camp Massad, Camp Ramah, and Pinemere Camp. Other non-denominational season summer camps include Camp Lohikan, Camp Watonka, and Pocono Springs Camp.

===Racing===

Pocono Raceway, a major automobile race track, is home to a NASCAR Cup Series race, the Pocono 400, in July. The track formerly hosted a second NASCAR Cup Series race, the Pocono 325, and an IndyCar race, the Pocono 500. It also serves as a racing school, motorcycle track, and hosts club events. The two NASCAR weekends at Pocono are vital to the region for the tourism money it brings to the local economy. Pocono Raceway is the closest major professional race track to Philadelphia and the major metropolitan areas of New York and New Jersey.

=== Skiing ===

Skiing was a $230 million per year industry in the Poconos and in 1987 accounted for one-quarter of the region&#x27;s tourist business. Pennsylvania native John Guresh, a Big Boulder Ski Resort employee, is credited for bringing the ski industry to the Poconos. In the winter of 1956–57 he invented a machine &quot;resembling a lawn sprinkler atop a sled&quot; to generate artificial snow. Joyce Gemperlein of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;Until Guresh perfected snowmaking at Big Boulder, skiing in the Poconos was a relatively minor sport.&quot; Ski resorts in the region could not rely on natural snow and, according to Big Boulder manager Ken Knize, there were times when conditions were right for skiing only two weeks a year. Cal Conniff, president of the National Ski Areas Association, regarded Guresh as &quot;one of the pioneers&quot; of the U.S. ski industry.

<doc id="1180664" wikidata="Q712759" url="?curid=1180664" title="Philip II, Latin Emperor">
<text>Philip II (10 November 1278 – 26 December 1331), also known as Philip I of Taranto, was titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople by marriage to Catherine of Valois–Courtenay, Despot of Romania, King of Albania, Prince of Achaea and Taranto.

Born in Naples, Philip was a younger son of Charles II of Anjou, King of Naples, and Maria of Hungary, daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary.

==First marriage==
On 4 February 1294, his father named him Prince of Taranto at Aix-en-Provence, and on 12 July 1294, Vicar-General of the Kingdom of Sicily. These dignities were a prelude to Charles&#x27; plan to bestow upon Philip an empire east of the Adriatic. The day he was invested as Vicar-General, he married by proxy Thamar Angelina Komnene, daughter of Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, Despot of Epirus. Threatened by the Byzantine Empire, Nikephoros had decided to seek Angevin patronage, and agreed to the marriage of Thamar and Philip. The two were married in person on 13 August 1294 at L&#x27;Aquila. Upon their marriage, Charles ceded to Philip the suzerainty of Achaea and the Kingdom of Albania, and all his rights to the Latin Empire and the Lordship of Vlachia. Nikephoros gave, as his daughter&#x27;s dowry, the fortresses of Vonitsa, Vrachova, Gjirokastër and Naupactus, in the territory of Aetolia, to Philip, and agreed to settle the succession, on his death, upon his daughter rather than his son Thomas. Upon the death of Nikephoros (c. 1297), Philip took the title of &quot;Despot of Romania&quot;, claiming Epirus, Aetolia, Acarnania, and Great Vlachia. However, Nikephoros&#x27; Byzantine widow, Anna Kantakouzene, had Thomas proclaimed Despot of Epirus and assumed the regency.

==War of the Vespers==
As Vicar-General of Sicily, he was part of the invasion of that island during the latter stage of the War of the Sicilian Vespers. His army was defeated in 1299 at the Battle of Falconara by Frederick III of Sicily, and he was held prisoner until the signing of the Treaty of Caltabellotta in 1302.

==Balkan adventure==
In 1306, Philip of Savoy and Isabella of Villehardouin, the Prince and Princess of Achaea, visited Charles&#x27; court in Naples. Philip of Savoy was accused of disloyalty and failure to support Charles in a campaign against Epirus. As Isabelle had not sought her suzerain&#x27;s consent before marrying him, Charles deprived the two of Achaea and bestowed it directly upon Philip of Taranto on 5 May 1306. He made his only personal visit to Achaea shortly thereafter, accepting the homage of his vassals at Glarentza, and carrying out an unsuccessful campaign against the Despotate of Epirus. He left Guy II, Duke of Athens, as his bailli in Achaea. Meanwhile, Philip and Isabella relinquished their claims on Achaea on 11 May 1307 in exchange for the County of Alba.

==Second marriage==
In 1309, Philip accused Thamar of adultery, probably on a falsified charge. This freed him to take part in a complex marital pact. Catherine of Valois, the titular Latin Empress, had been betrothed to Hugh V, Duke of Burgundy, titular King of Thessalonica. This engagement was broken, and she married Philip on 29 July 1313, at Fontainebleau. In exchange, her maternal lands of Courtenay and other estates on the Continent were ceded to Hugh&#x27;s sister Joan the Lame, who married Catherine&#x27;s half-brother, Philip of Valois. Hugh V was betrothed to Joan of France, later Countess of Burgundy and Artois. (Hugh died before in 1315 before the marriage could be solemnized; Joan of France married Hugh&#x27;s brother and successor Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy instead.) Philip ceded the Principality of Achaea (over which he retained suzerainty) to Matilda of Hainaut, who married Hugh&#x27;s brother Louis of Burgundy on 29 July 1313. This donation was rather restricted: should the couple die without heirs, the Principality was to revert to the house of Burgundy, while Matilda enjoyed the usufruct for life. Nor could Matilda marry again without her suzerain&#x27;s permission. To complete the separation of Eastern and Western claims, Hugh ceded his rights to Thessalonica to Louis, while Louis renounced his claims on his parents&#x27; inheritance in favor of Hugh. The engagement of Philip&#x27;s eldest son Charles of Taranto to Matilda of Hainault was broken off, and he was engaged to Jeanne de Valois, younger sister of Catherine of Valois; his father also ceded to him the title of Despot of Romania and the claims thereto appertaining.

==Guelph-Ghibelline War==
In 1315, Philip was sent by his brother Robert of Naples to lead an army relieving the Florentines, who were threatened by the Pisans under Uguccione della Faggiuola. The Florentine-Neapolitan army was badly beaten at the Battle of Montecatini on 29 August 1315; Philip&#x27;s younger brother Peter, Count of Gravina and his son Charles of Taranto were both killed.

==Frankish Greece==
The death of Louis of Burgundy without heirs in 1316 upset the Angevin plans for Achaea. Matilda was invited to marry John of Gravina, Philip&#x27;s younger brother, by their elder brother, Robert of Naples. When she declined, she was kidnapped and brought to Naples. By long persuasion and threats, she was compelled in 1318 to consent to the marriage, whereupon Frederick Trogisio was sent to Achaea as a new baili. In 1320, Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, after several protests, agreed to sell his rights to Achaea and Thessalonica to Louis, Count of Clermont for 40,000 livres. However, Philip, financed by Philip V of France, bought the claims for the same sum in 1321. In the meantime, the refractory Matilda of Hainaut was brought before the Papal court in Avignon, where she revealed that she had secretly married the Burgundian knight Hugh de La Palice. Her marriage with John was annulled on the grounds of non-consummation, but the revelation of her secret marriage again furnished a pretext for the confiscation of Achaea by the Angevins. It was, of course, bestowed directly upon John of Gravina, in exchange for 40,000 livres, the price paid to the Duke of Burgundy. Matilda spent the rest of her unfortunate life as a prisoner of the Neapolitan state, to prevent the resurgence of her claim.

Philip continued to plot the recovery of the Latin Empire, making an alliance in 1318 with his nephew Charles I of Hungary for that purpose, but to no effect. In 1330, the last of his sons by his first marriage died, returning to him the title of Despot of Romania. All his rights and titles passed on his death two years later to his eldest son by his second marriage, Robert of Taranto.

<text>The RPG-26 &quot;Aglen&quot; is a disposable anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher developed by the Soviet Union. It fires a one-stage rocket with jack-knife fins, which unfold after launch. The rocket carries a diameter high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) single shaped charge warhead able to penetrate of armour, of reinforced concrete or of brickwork. It has a maximum effective range of around . The similar sized rocket features a slightly heavier and more powerful HEAT warhead and more powerful rocket engine. The limited extension of the RPG-22 launch tube was found of little use. Thus, the RPG-26 has a rigid non-telescoping launch tube.

== Variants ==
The &quot;RShG-2&quot; (Russian: , &quot;Reaktivnaya Shturmovaya Granata&quot;, Rocket-propelled Assault Grenade) &quot;Aglen-2&quot; (Аглень-2) is a RPG-26 variant with thermobaric warhead. RShG-2 is heavier than the RPG-26 at and has a reduced direct fire range of . It is intended for use against infantry and structures rather than armoured vehicles. 

The warhead contains of thermobaric mixture, with an explosive yield roughly equal to that of of trinitrotoluene (TNT). The solid rocket booster of the warhead was taken from the RPG-26 and the fuse taken from the TBG-7 warhead used by the RPG-7. The warhead has a stated penetration ability of of concrete and of brickwork.

<text>The RPG-27 is a Soviet single shot disposable rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) shoulder-fired missile and rocket launcher. It entered service with the Soviet Army in 1989.

==History==
The RPG-27 &quot;Tavolga&quot; (&#x27;meadow grass&#x27;) was developed by the State Research and Production Enterprise, Bazalt, as a modern, anti-tank grenade launcher with a one-stage rocket, designed to defeat modern and future tanks with advanced reactive and composite armor, and fortified infantry. The RPG-27 was developed by the Soviet Union from the RPG-26.

==Description==
The RPG-27 shares a close resemblance to the prior RPG-26 in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank grenade launcher with a single shot capacity. The RPG-27 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-26, which enables higher armour penetration. The RPG-27 fin stabilised round is a 105 mm tandem-charge high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead with a range of . The round has a stated penetration ability in excess of of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) (after explosive reactive armour (ERA) and of brick or concrete and of earth.

==Variants==

=== RShG-1 ===
The RShG-1 (Реактивная Штурмовая Граната, &quot;Reaktivnaya Shturmovaya Granata&quot;, Rocket-propelled Assault Grenade) &quot;Tavolga-1&quot; (Таволга-1) is a variant of RPG-27 with thermobaric warhead. It is intended to be used against soft skinned and lightly armored vehicles, buildings, military installations and infantry. The RShG-1 is very similar in operation to the RPG-27. It has a lethal radius of and a larger sighting range of . The warhead contains of thermobaric mixture, with an explosive yield roughly equal to that of of TNT. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.

=== RMG ===
RMG is a smaller, multipurpose variant of the RShG-1 that is optimized as a bunker buster and to defeat light vehicles and infantry in cover. As a result, its penetration performance against tank armor is reduced.

The launcher carries a tandem warhead. The precursor HEAT warhead penetrates armour or other obstacles (reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.). The aerosol produced by the main thermobaric warhead enters the target through the opening created by the precursor charge and combusts, producing high-explosive and incendiary effects.

The RMG (&quot;Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya Granata&quot; or &quot;rocket-propelled multi-purpose grenade&quot;) rocket launcher was developed by Bazalt in the early 2000s. The launcher and round share the same designation, as is standard for disposable rocket launchers. S. Kh. Irtuganov was the lead designer for the project. It was officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.

<text>Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere is a British sitcom starring and written by Peter Kay and Paddy McGuinness. It was broadcast on Channel 4 and began on 12 November 2004, running for six 30-minute episodes up until 17 December 2004. A spin-off from &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;, the series follows the two Bolton doormen/bouncers Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Bygraves (Kay) and Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; O&#x27;Shea (McGuinness) as they tour around the UK in their campervan. They are fugitives due to an incident in the last episodes of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, in which a club patron threatened to have them killed by hitmen.

==Background==
Although the series was broadcast two years after &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;, the plot is set immediately after the events of the previous series. Max is the older and more level-headed of the two, roughly 40 years old, and usually pretending to have more life experience than he has actually had, including a stint in the army. Paddy is an idealistic wide boy obsessed with sex, pornography and food. Max often oppressively stares at Paddy or anyone who has offended his tastes and often shouts &quot;H-how dare you!&quot;. He also calls people a clown or a melon if they&#x27;ve said something absurd.

The motor home originally purchased by Max in &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; was a Ford; however, the motor home they use in &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot; is a Fiat. Peter Kay touched on this in the DVD commentary of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, saying that he should have told the production company to buy a larger motor home than the Ford as he intended to use it in the spin-off.

==Theme song==
The theme song was written by Toni Baker and Peter Kay, and borrowed heavily from the theme to the 1970s American series &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot;. The lyrics are &quot;Don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re going, Got no way of knowing, Driving on the Road to Nowhere. Sponging for a living, Checkin&#x27; out the women, Riding on the Road to Nowhere... And we don&#x27;t take shit from anyone, The only thing we wanna do is have some fun. We&#x27;re Max and Paddy (Paddy and Max!), And best of all, we don&#x27;t pay council tax!&quot;.

Singer Tony Christie was to sing the show&#x27;s theme, but his version was only used once, at the very end of the final episode. Kay and McGuinness themselves sang it in the opening sequences of episodes 2 to 6. Episode 1&#x27;s opening theme is instrumental and episodes 2 - 5&#x27;s closing themes are too.

==Episodes==

===Episode 1===
In Dover, Max and Paddy buy a plasma television from an Irish crook called Gypsy Joe (played by Brendan O&#x27;Carroll). This leads to several arguments, especially when they realise the television doesn&#x27;t have any speakers. The pair thus decide to go out to a nightclub to cheer themselves up and relax, but Max&#x27;s uncoordinated dancing spoils the night and he ends up fighting with some sailors home on shore leave. Paddy teaches him a few cool moves the following day, and they return to the club dressed as sailors in order to blend in. Their new moves lure two local girls, Tracey and Louise, back to the campervan, only for one of them to steal Paddy&#x27;s wallet. After discovering the girls, locally known as the &#x27;Belgrano Sisters&#x27;, are infamous for this, they get revenge by forcing them to steal some speakers for their television.

This episode had 4.2m viewers.

===Episode 2===
After a stint in a porn film (a film called Willy Wanker and the Chocolate Factory - a gay porn parody of Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory) leaves Paddy humiliated, the campervan breaks down in the Midlands. The pair hand it over to a local garage run by Mick Bustin, played by Noddy Holder. While waiting, Max and Paddy catch the train to Middlewood, which actually turns out to be the last one that day, so the pair are forced to trek back through the woods, but get lost. After Max shows an incredulous Paddy his notebook filled with childlike drawings of a television programme he&#x27;s invented called &quot;Magnet and Steel&quot;, the pair reluctantly decide to sleep rough in the woods. Paddy causes tension by burning Max&#x27;s book on their campfire, but Max eventually forgives Paddy and begins discussing, accompanied by a flashback, his one true love: a dwarf called Tina, whom he met in 1994.

He goes on to say that the relationship abruptly ended after she overheard his friends making jokes about her height, but left before she could see Max headbutt one of them in her defence. The following morning, the two discover to their annoyance that they were a short walk away from a Petrol Station and a Travelodge. Their situation worsens when Mick Bustin tries to charge them £500 to retrieve the campervan, causing the pair to break into Bustin&#x27;s workshop and, in a parody of &quot;The A-Team&quot;, modify the van and &#x27;bust&#x27; out back on to the road, only for the van to break down again miles later, Mick Bustin having never actually made any repairs.

This episode features several regulars from &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;, and a homage to the movie &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. Paddy&#x27;s full name is revealed to be Patrick O&#x27;Shea. This joke is based around the rumour that Sunderland player John O&#x27;Shea is regularly teased by team-mates for his physical resemblance to Patrick McGuinness.

This episode had 3.26m viewers.

===Episode 3===
The pair arrive in London, and immediately have an altercation with the traffic police. Later, Max spots in a local newspaper a 40th birthday message for his old school friend Kevin &#x27;The Wolfster&#x27; Wolfson, who had moved to London some years before. Max and Paddy turn up unannounced at his birthday party and surprise &#x27;The Wolfster&#x27;, as well as several other old faces from home present for the party. Tina (played by Lisa Hammond), Max&#x27;s one true love mentioned in the previous episode, turns up. Max tries to make amends with her, and discovers that she is actually married to, and has a child with, The Wolfster.

However, the child, a 10-year-old boy called Daniel, who is actually Max&#x27;s biological son. Tina warns Max to keep his distance and not reveal the secret. The following morning he informs Paddy and the pair steal what they think is a school bus with Daniel aboard. They&#x27;ve got the wrong bus instead of the right bus when Daniel goes on. However, they&#x27;re both captured by the police and sent directly to prison. The comic actor Reece Shearsmith turns up in this episode as one of Max&#x27;s old friends. The &#x27;Row Row Row Your Boat&#x27; sequence on the bus is borrowed from &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, and in the scene where The Wolfster writes his telephone number on a beermat and hands it to Max, it is clearly a Peter Kay beermat, tying in with Kay&#x27;s TV adverts for John Smith&#x27;s Brewery bitter.

This episode had 3.01m viewers.

===Episode 4 ===
The pair are now in prison after the school bus siege. Paddy is then forced to share a cell with a tennis-playing Cliff Richard impersonator who actually believes he &quot;is&quot; Cliff. After a bad first night, Paddy admits his fear of being &#x27;bummed&#x27; in the shower room. Max convinces him the best thing to do is make the other prisoners believe they are not just two inept doormen, but feared gangsters called &#x27;The Phoenix Twins&#x27;. After a fight with a camp inmate called Pepe, Max and Paddy are soon confronted by the main man of their wing, Raymond The Bastard (played by Everal Walsh), who is also Pepe&#x27;s boyfriend. Raymond is the worse of Paddy&#x27;s nightmares when Paddy drops the soap, and is eagerly commented about his manhood as &quot;Stunning, like a young Burt Reynolds!&quot;. Raymond has heard about the pair&#x27;s alleged big-money heists and robberies, and wants a cut of their money. Max agrees just to get Raymond off their backs and receive preferential treatment, including access to luxury chocolates and Sky+ .

Soon, their old Phoenix Club boss Brian Potter (played by Kay) unexpectedly comes to visit, along with a cake, announcing that he&#x27;s organising several events to help speed up their release. They reject him, not wanting a high-profile campaign ruining their chances of release. Potter fails to listen, and the whole wing later see him on the news talking about &#x27;the doormen&#x27; Max and Paddy: thus revealing their stories as lies. A big fight is about to break out between Raymond and his henchmen against Max and Paddy. However, the fight is prevented by a prison officer telling Max and Paddy to come with him. The episode concludes with Tina, Max&#x27;s ex-love, admitting to the authorities that Daniel is actually Max&#x27;s son and he was acting under stress when he stole the bus. The pair are released, having their sentences reduced to community service, and get revenge on Brian Potter by informing the Home Office that there is an outbreak of anthrax at his club. We find out in this episode that Max&#x27;s full name is Maxwell Bygraves, a jokey reference to the veteran British entertainer Max Bygraves.

===Episode 5===
In the West Country, Paddy is driving the van when he accidentally runs over and kills a cow walking in the road. Tracing the cow to a nearby farm, the pair head off to find the farmer and claim expenses for the damage to the van. They come across what they assume is him: a mentally unstable, dirty old man in a field, who instead of giving them compensation money sells them a breeder pig for £100. He claims they can sell it on at market for around £300. When Max and Paddy reach the cattle market, they discover the pig in ill health and they&#x27;ve been conned. After several unsuccessful attempts to sell the pig on to butchers shops, a supermarket, and even a Halal outlet, Max and Paddy decide to kill it themselves to get rid of the burden. They have a change of heart though and head back to the farm to reclaim their £100. They soon discover that the old man who sold them the pig initially was actually the alcoholic father-in-law of the real farmer, and their money has probably all gone to the nearest pub. Also the farmer isn&#x27;t very happy about the two killing one of his cows. Guest starring Graham Walker of The Grumbleweeds.

This episode had 3.43m viewers.

===Episode 6===
Max and Paddy drive into North East England to visit Max&#x27;s old doorman friend Billy &#x27;The Butcher&#x27; Shannon, who had previously briefly appeared in the 1994 flashback in Episode 2. They agree to let Shannon, who is looking for his estranged son, hitch a ride around. They soon discover though that he&#x27;s obsessed with Max (&quot;Not in a gay way&quot; he claims), and detests Paddy because Paddy took Billy&#x27;s job when Billy went to prison. What they fail to notice at the same time is that Shannon is carrying a revolver, which he uses to force a Little Chef employee called Brenda (played by Alex Hall) to open for the trio late at night. The police are quickly on to the gang, with only Shannon aware of any crime. When the campervan stops off later down the road, Max sees a newspaper headline and realises what&#x27;s happening. Furthermore, Billy catches Paddy going through his stuff and prepares to shoot him.

A chase eventually ensues through the services and along a motorway tunnel bridge, and Shannon shoots Paddy in the bottom. As he&#x27;s about to shoot Max, Paddy has a second wind, and whacks Shannon around the head with a traffic cone, using Peter Kay&#x27;s TV catchphrase of &quot;&#x27;Ave It!&quot; in the process. With Shannon now unconscious and arrested, Max and Paddy slip away from a police lecture - due to the fact that earlier in the episode they cut down a speed camera - and drive-off into the night.

This episode had 3.26m viewers.

==Future==
A second series of the show was initially planned for 2006, but Peter Kay instead confirmed a third series of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; (which as of 2025 has not yet happened). On 22 February 2010, Peter Kay stated to &quot;The Sun&quot; that he and Paddy McGuinness planned to do more specials of &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road To Nowhere&quot;. He wanted Phil &#x27;The Pastie&#x27; Murphy to play the portly soldier in love with Max&#x27;s mother. He had also stated in 2010, during an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show, that he wanted Sir Terry Wogan to play an Irish baddie when Max and Paddy go to a funeral in Ireland but, after a stag night, only have fancy dress magician clothes. Mayhem would then ensue as they tried to act appropriately in the situation, only to keep unintentionally doing magic tricks based on what they found in their outfits.

On 27 November 2014 live shows were announced for Comic Relief, with the full cast returning.

==&quot;Max &amp; Paddy&#x27;s The Power of Two&quot;==
A spoof fitness DVD was released, &quot;Max &amp; Paddy&#x27;s The Power of Two&quot;, including several gags and pieces of scenery from the main series. The DVD also included extra workout tips and a segment instructed by Brian Potter live from the Phoenix Club. On the DVD packaging, it is now referred to as &quot;The UK&#x27;s fastest selling fitness DVD – Ever!&quot; Although the main workout is shown in full, it is more intended as a spoof product than a genuine workout.

<text>Vitaly Valeryevich Tseshkovsky (; 25 September 1944, Omsk – 24 December 2011, Krasnodar) was a Russian chess Grandmaster and a former champion of the USSR.

==Biography==
Tseshkovsky (Cieszkowski) was born in Omsk (his noble ancestors lived in Volhynia).

He was awarded the International Master title in 1973 and became an International Grandmaster in 1975.

His best tournament victories include first at Leipzig 1975, Dubna 1976, Yerevan 1980, Banja Luka 1981, Sochi 1981 and Minsk 1982. He was co-winner of the 1978 Soviet Championship (with Mikhail Tal) and winner of the 1986 Championship. He beat some world champions: Vasily Smyslov at the Moscow Spartakiad 1974, Tal at Sochi 1970, and a young Garry Kasparov at the 1978 Soviet Championship. Tseshkovsky himself almost qualified for the World Championship candidates matches when he finished fourth in the 1976 Manila Interzonal, one place lower than was needed to progress to the next stage. At the 27th Chess Olympiad in 1986, he scored 2½/5 as the second reserve board to help the USSR team win the gold medal.

His 6/9 result in Saint Petersburg, 2004 qualified Tseshkovsky to play in the Russian Championship final later in the year, alongside Russia&#x27;s seven top players (including Garry Kasparov who won) and five other qualifiers. In 2008 he tied for first with Farrukh Amonatov and Anton Filippov in the Georgy Agzamov Memorial tournament in Tashkent. In the following year he took clear first place in the same tournament. Tseshkovsky won the European Senior Chess Championship in 2009 and 2010.
In 2010, he also tied for 2nd-4th with Algimantas Butnorius and Nikolai Pushkov in the European Seniors’ Rapid Championship, which was won by Viktor Kupreichik.
In the opening, his choice was 1.e4 with the white pieces. With Black he played the Ruy Lopez, Sicilian Defence, Pirc Defence and Modern Defence against 1.e4, and against 1.d4 he most often played the Grünfeld Defence and Benko Gambit.

Tseshkovsky maintained a high standard of chess throughout his career, registering his highest Elo rating of 2600 in October 2005. As a coach, he assisted with the training of many high-profile players including Vladimir Kramnik, Bartlomiej Macieja and Boris Savchenko.

He died on 24 December 2011 in Krasnodar. The cause of death was a heart attack that happened while he was at the chessboard participating in a tournament.

<doc id="1180710" wikidata="Q2728730" url="?curid=1180710" title="Gratitude">
<text>Gratitude, thankfulness, or gratefulness is a feeling of appreciation (or similar positive response) by a recipient of another&#x27;s kindness. This kindness can be gifts, help, favors, or another form of generosity to another person.

The word comes from the Latin word , which means &quot;pleasing&quot; or &quot;thankful&quot;. The absence of gratitude where gratitude is expected is called ingratitude or ungratefulness.

Gratitude has been a part of several world religions. It also has been a topic of interest to ancient, medieval, and modern philosophers.

The discipline of psychology attempts to understand the short term experience of gratitude (state gratitude), individual differences in how frequently gratitude is felt (trait gratitude), the relationship between these two, and the therapeutic benefits of gratitude.

==Philosophical approaches==
Gratitude is a topic of interest in the philosophical disciplines of normative ethics, applied ethics, and political philosophy, as well as in the field of moral psychology.

== Religious approaches ==

Spirituality and gratitude are not dependent on each other, but studies have found that spirituality can enhance a person&#x27;s ability to be grateful. Those who regularly attend religious services or engage in religious activities are more likely to have a greater sense of gratitude in all areas of life. Gratitude is prized in the Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Baháʼí, and Hindu traditions. Worship with gratitude to God, or a similar religious figure, is a common theme in such religions, and the concept of gratitude permeates religious texts, teachings, and traditions. It is one of the most common emotions that religions aim to evoke and maintain in followers and is regarded as a universal religious sentiment.

=== Jewish conceptions ===

In Judaism, gratitude is an essential part of the act of worship and every aspect of a worshipper&#x27;s life. According to the Hebrew worldview, all things come from God and, due to this, gratitude is essential to the followers of Judaism.

The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with the idea of gratitude. Two examples in the Psalms are &quot;O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever&quot;, and &quot;I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart.&quot; Jewish prayers often incorporate gratitude, beginning with the Shema, in which the worshipper states that out of gratitude, &quot;You shall love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.&quot; One of the crucial blessings in the central thrice-daily prayer, the Amidah, is called Modim – &quot;We give thanks to You&quot;; this is also the only blessing that is recited by the congregation together with the leader during their repetition of the Amidah. The concluding prayer, the Alenu, also speaks of gratitude by thanking God for the particular destiny of the Jewish people. Along with these prayers, faithful worshippers recite more than one hundred blessings, called , throughout the day.

In Judaism there is also a significant emphasis on gratitude for acts of human kindness and goodness.

=== Christian conceptions ===

Martin Luther referred to gratitude as &quot;the basic Christian attitude&quot; and today it is still referred to as &quot;the heart of the gospel&quot;. Christians are encouraged to praise and give gratitude to their creator. In Christian gratitude, God is seen as the selfless giver of all good things and, because of this, gratefulness enables Christians to share a common bond, shaping all aspects of a follower&#x27;s life. Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgement of God&#x27;s generosity that inspires Christians to shape their own thoughts and actions around such ideals.

Not simply a sentimental feeling, Christian gratitude is a virtue that shapes not only emotions and thoughts, but also actions and deeds.

Jonathan Edwards wrote in his book &quot;A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections&quot; that gratitude and thankfulness toward God are among the signs of true religion. Allport (1950) suggested that mature religious intentions come from feelings of profound gratitude; Edwards (1746/1959) claimed that the &quot;affection&quot; of gratitude is one of the most accurate ways to find the presence of God in a person&#x27;s life. In a small sample of Catholic nuns and priests, out of 50 emotions, love and gratitude were the most experienced emotions towards God. 

Pope Francis has noted that one of the lessons generally learned in family life is learning to say &quot;thank you&quot; as &quot;an expression of genuine gratitude for 
what we have been given&quot;.

In the Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican churches, the most important rite is called the Eucharist; the name derives from the Greek word &quot;Eucharistic&quot;, meaning thanksgiving.

=== Islamic conceptions ===
The Islamic sacred text, the Quran, is filled with the idea of gratitude. Islam encourages Muslims to be grateful and to express thanks to Allah in all circumstances. Muslims commonly express their gratitude using the term &quot;Alhamdulillah&quot; (praise be to God), which is one of the four beloved words of Allah.

Even some verses of Quran indicates that, our main duty on this earth is to show our gratitude. For example, 

In this verse satan is saying to Allah that He will not find most humans grateful toward Him after when he (satan) refused to prostrate Adam. And the term Kafir also means &#x27;ungrateful&#x27; (toward God) with the most fundamental sense in Quran.
Here are some other verses from Quran:


Islamic teaching emphasizes that those who are grateful will be rewarded with more. A traditional Islamic saying is &quot;The first who will be summoned to paradise are those who have praised God in every circumstance.&quot; The Quran also states, in Sura 14, that those who are grateful will be given more by Allah.

Many practices of Islam encourage gratitude. For example, the Pillar of Islam that calls for daily prayer encourages believers to pray to Allah five times a day in order to thank him for his goodness, and the pillar of fasting during the month of Ramadan is for the purpose of putting the believer in a state of gratitude.

== Individual differences in gratitude ==
It is important to note that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping expressions of gratitude worldwide. Much research into gratitude focuses on individual differences in gratitude and the consequences of being a more or less grateful person. Three scales have been developed to measure individual differences in gratitude, each of which assesses somewhat different conceptions. The GQ6 measures individual differences in how frequently and intensely people feel gratitude. The Appreciation Scale measures eight different aspects of gratitude: appreciation of people, possessions, the present moment, rituals, feelings of awe, social comparisons, existential concerns, and behavior which expresses gratitude. The GRAT assesses gratitude towards other people, gratitude towards the world in general, and a lack of resentment for what you lack. A study showed that these scales all measure the same way of approaching life; this suggests that individual differences in gratitude include all of these components.

==Empirical findings==

===Association with well-being===

Gratitude not only contributes to positive emotions, but it also leads to a reduction in negative emotions. People who are more grateful have higher levels of subjective well-being. Grateful people are happier, less depressed, less stressed, and more satisfied with their lives and social relationships. Gratitude may shield against depression by enhancing the encoding and recall of positive experiences. Grateful people tend to exercise greater levels of control over their environments, experience personal growth, find purpose in life, and accept themselves. They also tend to employ more constructive coping strategies when faced with life&#x27;s challenges. They are more likely to seek support from other people and to reinterpret and grow from experiences, and they spend more time planning how to deal with problems. Grateful people rely less on negative coping mechanisms, such as avoidance, self-blame, or substance use. Grateful people also sleep better, because they think more positive thoughts just before going to sleep. They tend to have better relationships, as a person&#x27;s gratitude can positively impact their partner&#x27;s satisfaction in the relationship. Grateful people are more likely to have higher levels of happiness and lower levels of stress and depression.

Although many emotions and personality traits are important to well-being and mental health, gratitude may be especially important. A longitudinal study showed that people who were more grateful coped better with a life transition. Specifically, people who were more grateful before the transition were less stressed, less depressed, and more satisfied with their relationships three months later. Two other studies suggested that gratitude may have a unique relationship with well-being and can explain aspects of well-being that other personality traits cannot. Both studies showed that gratitude was able to explain more well-being than the Big Five and 30 of the most commonly studied personality traits.

Gratitude also has a positive impact on physical well-being. For example, in one study, teens who wrote letters expressing gratitude to other people over the course of a month were more inclined to eat healthier food. This phenomenon might be explained by the notion that when people experience gratitude, they are more motivated to reciprocate the kindness shown by others. Therefore, rather than engaging in behaviors that may undermine their own health, they feel driven to adopt healthier lifestyles as a way of acknowledging the support they have received from others. Moreover, gratitude is known to trigger positive emotions, which in turn direct individuals&#x27; attention towards optimistic possibilities in the future. As a result, people are more likely to embrace behaviors that are conducive to a better future, such as healthy eating.

People who express gratitude also demonstrate improved overall health by way of greater physical activity, better sleep, fewer health care visits, and better nutrition. Practicing gratitude may be correlated with small improvements in cardiovascular health.

===Relationship to altruism===
Gratitude makes people more altruistic. One study found that gratitude correlates with economic generosity. The study used an economic game, and showed increased gratitude to directly mediate increased monetary giving, and that grateful people are more likely to sacrifice individual gains for communal profit. Another study found similar correlations between gratitude and empathy, generosity, and helpfulness towards the creation of social reciprocity, even with strangers, that is beneficial to the individuals in the short and in the middle terms.

===As a motivator of behavior===

Gratitude may reinforce future prosocial behavior in benefactors. For example, one experiment found that customers of a jewelry store who were called and thanked showed a subsequent 70% increase in purchases. In comparison, customers who were called and told about a sale showed only a 30% increase in purchases, while customers who were not called at all showed no increase in purchases. In another study, a restaurant&#x27;s regular patrons gave bigger tips when servers wrote &quot;Thank you&quot; on their checks.

Some starkly distinguish between gratitude and indebtedness. While both emotions may occur in response to help or favors, indebtedness is said to occur when an individual subjectively perceives that they are under an obligation to provide repayment or compensation for the aid. The two emotions then lead to different actions: Indebtedness may motivate the recipient to avoid the person who helped them, whereas gratitude may motivate a recipient to seek out their benefactor and to improve their relationship with them. A study of the feelings of migrant adolescents towards their parents noted that &quot;gratitude serves and indebtedness challenges intergenerational relations after migration&quot;. The study also noted that, &quot;when the expectations of return from the benefactor increase, indebtedness of the beneficiary increases but gratitude decreases&quot;. Unlike compassion or sadness, gratitude decreases cigarette craving suggesting a potential role in public health reductions of appetitive risk behaviors.

===Psychological interventions===

Several psychological interventions have been developed to increase gratitude.

For example, Watkins and colleagues had participants test a number of different gratitude exercises, such as thinking about a living person for whom they are grateful, writing about someone for whom they are grateful, and writing a letter to deliver to someone for whom they are grateful. Participants in the control group were asked to describe their living room. Participants who engaged in a gratitude exercise showed increases in their experiences of positive emotion immediately after the exercise, and this effect was strongest for participants who were asked to think about a person for whom they are grateful. Participants who had grateful personalities to begin with showed the greatest benefit from these gratitude exercises.

In another study, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic intervention conditions designed to improve the participants&#x27; overall quality of life. Of these, the biggest short-term effects came from a &quot;gratitude visit&quot; in which participants wrote and delivered a letter of gratitude to someone in their life. This condition showed a rise in happiness scores by 10 percent and a significant fall in depression scores, results that lasted up to one month after the visit. Of the six conditions, the longest-lasting effects were associated with writing &quot;gratitude journals&quot; of three things they were grateful for every day. These participants&#x27; happiness scores also increased and continued to increase each time they were tested periodically after the experiment. The greatest benefits were usually found to occur around six months after treatment began. This exercise was so successful that although participants were only asked to continue the journal for a week, many participants continued to keep the journal long after the study was over.

Similar results have been found in studies conducted by Emmons and McCullough (2003) and Lyubomirsky &quot;et al.&quot; (2005).

The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, offered awards for dissertation-level research projects with the greatest potential to advance the science and practice of gratitude.

=== Relationship to mental health ===
A study on the benefits of mental health counseling divided approximately 300 college students into three groups prior to their first counseling session. The first group was instructed to write one letter of gratitude a week for three weeks, the second group was asked to write about their negative experiences, and the third group received only counseling. When compared, the first group reported better mental health after completing their writing exercises. The study suggests that practicing gratitude may help the brain react more sensitively to the experience of gratitude in the future, and therefore, may improve mental health.

==Conclusions==

Multiple studies have shown the positive correlation between gratitude and increased well being, not only for the person expressing gratitude, but for all people involved. The positive psychology movement embraced these studies and, in an effort to increase overall well-being, has begun to incorporate mental and emotional exercises to increase gratitude.

<text>The Thacher School is a private co-educational day and boarding school in Ojai, California. Founded in 1889 as a boys&#x27; school, it began admitting girls in 1977 and is California&#x27;s oldest co-educational boarding school, as well as the oldest private boarding school west of the Mississippi River. The school educates approximately 250 students in grades 9–12, who come from 21 states and 12 countries.

Originally a ranch, Thacher&#x27;s 540-acre campus supports formal horse and outdoors programs. School founder Sherman Day Thacher believed in the power of the outdoors to help shape students: “Come West, breathe deep, let these hills be your teachers.” In 2019, the school&#x27;s older buildings were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==History and overview==

=== Origins ===
In 1887, Sherman Day Thacher moved to the Casa de Piedra (&quot;CdeP&quot;) orange ranch in Nordhoff, California (later renamed to Ojai) with his brother, who was seeking a &quot;fresh air&quot; cure for his tuberculosis. Thacher&#x27;s father Thomas was a professor at Yale, and in 1889, Thacher&#x27;s friend Henry W. Farnam (another Yale professor) asked Thacher to tutor his son for Yale&#x27;s entrance exams. Thacher agreed to do so, provided that the son move to California for his lessons. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Thacher is the oldest private boarding school west of the Mississippi.

At CdeP, Thacher tutored the younger Farnam in both academics and maturity, blending classroom studies with outdoor living and horsemanship. Tuition was $14 a week, &quot;washing excluded.&quot; Soon other friends were sending their sons out to California to receive Thacher&#x27;s instruction, and a school was born. By 1900, Thacher educated 45 students and its advertisements counted the presidents of Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley as references.

Sherman Thacher served as an inspiration (direct or indirect) for various other college-preparatory boarding schools. His Yale roommate Horace Dutton Taft visited CdeP in 1889, and Taft&#x27;s experience helped crystallize his decision to found Connecticut&#x27;s Taft School the following year. In addition, Curtis Cate taught English at Thacher in the 1900s before establishing Thacher&#x27;s athletic rival Cate School in 1910. Due to the school&#x27;s popularity, the admissions office was oversubscribed. As a result, Sherman Thacher encouraged Thompson Webb to move from Tennessee to Claremont, California and establish The Webb School of California, which opened in 1922.

Thacher incorporated the school as a nonprofit in 1924, but continued running the school until his death in 1931. He was succeeded by Morgan Barnes, who led the school for five years until Thacher&#x27;s son Anson (CdeP 1923) was ready to take over. Anson Thacher served as head of school from 1936 to 1949, and was the last member of the Thacher family to lead the school. He continued teaching math at Thacher until 1970.

=== Horse and outdoor programs ===
When founding the school, Sherman Thacher imposed &quot;the unusual requirement that each student must care for a horse,&quot; remarking that &quot;there&#x27;s something about the outside of a horse ... that&#x27;s good for the inside of a boy.&quot; (There was also a practical element to the horse program: &quot;students had to ride the five-mile trek into [downtown] Ojai every day just to pick up the mail.&quot;) Today, the Horse Program requires students to ride and care for a horse during all athletic seasons their freshman year at Thacher, while students who join at later grades complete the requirement during one athletic season. An annual gymkhana event provides students the opportunity to demonstrate horsemanship in competition. Though Western-style riding is required, the Horse Program offers an English riding elective in grades 10–12.

As part of the Outdoors Program, students are encouraged to take weekend camping trips into the local mountains, in addition to week-long trips each fall and spring that include backpacking, rock climbing, cycling, sailing, horse camping, canyoneering, backcountry skiing and kayaking.

=== Evolution ===
Under Sherman Thacher, the size of the student body was limited to approximately 60 students. Anson Thacher expanded enrollment to 94 boys by the time of his retirement, but Thacher&#x27;s primary period of expansion came in the 1960s and mid-1970s; the school educated 189 students by 1975. In 1977, Thacher began admitting female students.

=== Recent developments ===
From 1999 to 2008, Thacher conducted a $82 million fundraising campaign that both increased endowments for faculty salaries and student financial aid, and funded new buildings on campus (including a performing arts center, student commons, and dormitories).

The school launched a $160 million fundraising campaign in 2017. In 2018, Thacher reported that the campaign had helped grow the school endowment from $125 to $171 million. In 2020, Thacher further reported that its financial aid budget increased by 50.7% and the percentage of students on financial aid had increased by 5%. The campaign also funded a new academic building and dining hall, improved faculty housing, and a solar power facility that contributes more than 90% of the school&#x27;s energy needs.

== Admissions and student body ==
In 2024, the school&#x27;s admission rate was 16%. 79% of admitted students chose to enroll at Thacher. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked Thacher as the most selective boarding school in the United States; that year, its admission rate was 12%.

In the 2024–25 school year, Thacher educated 225 boarders and 20 non-faculty day students. 45% of boarding students came from outside California, and 14% of students came from abroad. 31% of Thacher students received financial aid. The average award was $64,993, equivalent to 83% of boarding tuition.

== Academics ==

=== Curriculum ===
Thacher students engage in a rigorous, college preparatory curriculum and are required to complete four years of Mathematics and English with three years of Science, History, and a foreign language of choice, plus two years of Art. Students must take five solid courses (defined as classes with substantial written homework) each term. Students are placed in and choose from more than 80 courses, ranging from English I to Advanced Music Theory. Classes such as Latin, Global Crises and Solutions, Astronomy Research, Modern Middle East, Advanced Actors Studio, Multivariable Calculus, Perspectives on Nature, Field Biology and Conservation are on offer.

Thacher uses the Harkness method in its classrooms. &quot;Daily preparation, thoughtful participation, analytical thinking and intellectual rigor&quot; are part of life in the Thacher classroom.

All seniors exhibit mastery on a topic by designing and researching a topic of choice. This Senior Exhibition must have an oral and written component and be presented to the Thacher community.

=== Test scores ===
For the Class of 2023, Thacher reported a middle-50% SAT score range of 1300-1520 and an average ACT score of 30.

=== Observatory program ===
Thacher has an astronomical research program, where students participate in astrophysics research in collaboration with teams at Harvard University, Boston University, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and the Las Cumbres Observatory.

The observatory was brought to campus in 1965 by Caltech and UCLA as part of the Summer Science Program. It was renovated in 2016 into a state-of-the-art, research-grade facility and now houses a PlaneWave CDK-700 telescope with a 0.7m aperture and a fully robotic dome. The observatory uses a flexible dispatch schedule for full automation.

==Campus and facilities==

The campus, located in the foothills in the northeast corner of the Ojai Valley, about 85 miles north of Los Angeles, was originally the Casa de Piedra ranch. Buildings reflect a variety of architectural styles, including California Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival.

In addition to the normal boarding school mix of athletic facilities like a gymnasium, tennis courts, track, three fields, fitness center, and pool (although the pool is not used for athletic events), the campus has barns, pastures, arenas, and fields for equestrian use, including a network of trails that links the campus to the adjacent Los Padres National Forest. The school maintains base camps in the Sespe Wilderness and the Eastern Sierra&#x27;s Golden Trout Wilderness, which it uses for backcountry trips, educational programs and alumni retreats. The school also hosts a game room, sand volleyball courts and two wellness centers.

==Mascot and traditions==
While The Thacher School&#x27;s symbol has always been the pegasus, its mascot is the toad, chosen, according to the founder&#x27;s grandson, Nick Thacher, for its quiet humility and persistence.

== 2021–23 sexual misconduct investigation ==

=== Internal and county investigations ===
In 2020, reports of sexual misconduct at Thacher circulated on social media. In response, the school hired law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson (MTO) to investigate these reports and other allegations of misconduct. Thacher published MTO&#x27;s 91-page report in June 2021 and a 168-page supplemental report in February 2023. As summarized by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, MTO investigators &quot;laid out episodes of alleged rape, groping, unwanted touching and inappropriate comments dating back 40 years in a level of detail surprising for a private institution.&quot; Collectively, the reports identified ten alleged perpetrators by name, collected incidents related to other, unnamed, alleged perpetrators, and disclosed allegations that former school administrators covered up student complaints.

With respect to contemporary incidents, MTO said that it did not receive any &quot;firsthand, credible reports&quot; of sexual misconduct by current school employees. In 2023, Thacher disclosed that in 2021, a current Thacher student had made an allegation of student-on-student physical abuse, and the school administration had inadvertently (that is, &quot;not due to any deliberate effort to obfuscate&quot;) delayed reporting the allegation to law enforcement for a period of months. The same year, the school had promptly reported a contemporary allegation of student-on-student sexual abuse.

In 2023, the Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s Office declined to file criminal charges, citing a variety of reasons, including the statute of limitations, a lack of proof for certain allegations, and victims who declined to press charges. Civil litigation is ongoing.

=== School response ===
Following publication of the 2021 report, the school&#x27;s board of trustees issued a statement acknowledging that &quot;many [students] suffered lasting harm not just from the sexual misconduct itself but also from the school’s handling of the misconduct.&quot; The board added that the school &quot;tolerated and at times fostered a culture that valued the experiences and voices of boys and men over those of girls and women and that allowed sexual misconduct to be minimized, ignored, and dismissed.&quot;

The school created a support fund to help victims pay for therapy. It also revised its sexual misconduct reporting process and hired several outside organizations to train its administrators and staff on how to prevent further instances of abuse in the future. In addition, the board of trustees removed the names of two former heads of school from the campus dining hall, the athletic field, and a hiking trail. The first administrator had &quot;fail[ed] to protect Thacher students from harm,&quot; and the second had been credibly accused of sexual misconduct.

Thacher&#x27;s head of school resigned in August 2022. Jeff Hooper became the acting/interim Head of School in 2021 and the permanent Head of School in 2023.
