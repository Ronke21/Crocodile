<text>In the Western Church of the Early and High Middle Ages, a sacramentary was a book used for liturgical services and the mass by a bishop or priest. Sacramentaries include only the words spoken or sung by him, unlike the missals of later centuries that include all the texts of the mass whether read by the bishop, priest, or others. Also, sacramentaries, unlike missals, include texts for services other than the mass such as ordinations, the consecration of a church or altar, exorcisms, and blessings, all of which were later included in Pontificals and Rituals instead.

In the late 20th century, the word &quot;sacramentary&quot; was used in the United States and some other English-speaking countries for the English translation of the Roman Missal, particularly those that, like earlier sacramentaries, omitted parts of the Mass not said by the priest.

==Decline of the sacramentary==
Other books used in the celebration of Mass included the Graduale (texts mainly from the Psalms, with musical notes added), the Evangeliarium or Gospel Book, and the Epistolary with texts from other parts of the New Testament, mainly the Epistles (letters) of Saint Paul.

In late mediaeval times, these books began to be combined, for the use of priests saying Mass without the assistance of a choir and other ministers. This led to the appearance of the &quot;Missale plenum&quot; (&quot;full or complete Missal&quot;) containing all the texts of the Mass (without the music of the choir parts).

Pope Pius V published in 1570 an official version of such a Missal, known as the Roman Missal.

At the behest of the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI greatly increased the amount of Sacred Scripture read at Mass and, to a lesser extent, the prayer formulas. This necessitated a return to having the readings in a separate book, known as the Lectionary. A separate Book of the Gospels, with texts extracted from the Lectionary, is recommended, but is not obligatory. The Roman Missal continues to include elaborate rubrics, as well as antiphons etc., which were not in sacramentaries.

== Textual groups ==

Of the textual groups of sacramentaries of the Roman Rite still extant, either complete or in part, the most important are the three known by the names Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian.

===The Leonine Sacramentary===

The &quot;Leonine Sacramentary&quot; is the oldest. Only one manuscript of it is known, written in the seventh century. This manuscript was found in the library of the cathedral chapter of Verona, was published by Joseph Bianchini in 1735, and was by him attributed arbitrarily to Pope Leo I (440-61). On the strength of this attribution the book still bears the name Leonine. It represents a pure Roman use with no Gallican elements. But it is not a book compiled for use at the altar. The confusion of its parts shows this. It is a fragment, containing no Canon nor Ordinary of the Mass, but a collection of Propers (Collects, Secrets, Prefaces, Postcommunions, and Orationes super populum), of various Masses with ordination forms, arranged according to the civil year. It begins in the middle of the sixth Mass for April, and ends with a blessing for the font &quot;In ieiunio mensis decimi&quot; (i. e. the winter Ember days). In each month groups of Masses are given, often very large groups, for each feast and occasion. Thus, for instance, in June we find twenty-eight Masses for St Peter and St Paul, one after another, each headed: &quot;Item alia&quot;; there are fourteen for St Lawrence, twenty-three for the anniversary of a bishop&#x27;s consecration, and so on. Evidently the writer has compiled as many alternative Masses for each occasion as he could find. In many cases he shows carelessness. Many of his Masses &quot;in natali episcoporum&quot; have nothing at all to do with that anniversary, and are really Masses for Sundays after Pentecost; in the middle of a Mass of St Cornelius and St Cyprian he has put the preface of a Mass of St Euphemia, a Mass for the new civil year is inserted among those for martyrs; Masses for St Stephen&#x27;s day (26 December) with evident allusions to Christmas are put in August, obviously through a confusion with the feast of the finding of his relics (3 August).

That the collection is Roman is obvious. It is full of local allusions to Rome. For instance, one of the collects to be said by a bishop on the anniversary of his consecration could only be used by the pope of Rome: &quot;Lord God ... who, although Thou dost not cease to enrich with many gifts Thy Church spread throughout the world, nevertheless dost look more favourably upon the see of Thy blessed Apostle Peter, as Thou hast desired that it should be most exalted, etc.&quot; The Preface for St John and St Paul remembers that they are buried within &quot;the boundaries of this city&quot;; the Masses of the Patrons of Rome, St Peter and St Paul, continually allude to the city.

Louis Duchesne concluded that the Leonine book is a private collection of prayers copied without much intelligence from the official books at Rome about the year 538. He arrives at this date especially through an allusion in the Secret of a Mass placed in June (but really an Easter Mass), which refers to a recent deliverance from enemies. This allusion he understands to refer to the raising of the siege of Rome by Vitiges and his Goths at Easter-time, 538. Another writer attributed the allusion to Alaric&#x27;s invasion in 402, and held that the compilation was made between 366 and 461. Another considered that the book was composed under Pope Felix III (483-492). Yet another suggests that the book is a compilation of Roman Masses made in the sixth or seventh century for use in Gaul, so that the composers of Roman books who were at that time introducing the Roman Rite into Gaul might have a source from which to draw their material. He suggests Gregory of Tours (died 594) as possibly the compiler.

=== The Gelasian Sacramentary ===

The &quot;Gelasian Sacramentary&quot; contains everything needed by a priest in charge of a Roman titular or parish church. The archetype, now lost, was likely written in the mid-7th century, possibly for the Church of St Peter in Chains in Rome. It features modifications introduced by Gregory the Great (590–604) in the canon of the Mass (notably the insertion of the prayer &quot;Hanc igitur&quot;), but does not yet contain either the Agnus Dei made official by Pope Sergius I (r. 687–701) or the Masses for the Thursdays in Lent added by Pope Gregory II (r. 715–731).

The oldest extant copy of the sacramentary, a book now often called the &quot;Old Gelasian Sacramentary&quot;, Vatican Reg. lat. 316, was made in the 7th or early 8th century for use in the abbey of St Denis at Paris. It includes five interpolated sections that introduce liturgical practices of Gaul from the time the manuscript was copied, but the interpolations are easily distinguished from the Roman sections of the text.

The Old Gelasian Sacramentary consists of three books. Book I includes masses for feasts and Sundays from Christmas Eve to the octave of Pentecost (there were at the time no special masses for the season after Pentecost), together with ordinations, prayers for all the rites of the catechumenate, blessing of the font and oil at the Easter Vigil, dedication of churches, and reception of nuns. Book II includes the Proper of Saints throughout the year, the Common of Saints, and the Advent Masses. Book III includes a great number of masses marked simply &quot;For Sunday&quot; (i.e., any Sunday), the Canon of the Mass, what would today be called votive masses (e.g., for travellers, in time of trouble, for kings, and so on), masses for the dead, some blessings (of holy water, fruits, trees and so on), and various prayers for special occasions.

The Gelasian Sacramentary was revised in the 8th century at the prompting of Pepin the Short, work that was likely undertaken at Flavigny Abbey and completed between 760 and 770. The sacramentary, now lost, is sometimes called the &quot;Sacrementary of King Pepin&quot;. The family of manuscripts copied from it are generally called &quot;Frankish Gelasian&quot; or &quot;Eighth-Century Gelasian&quot; sacramentaries. The most faithful copy is considered to be the &quot;Sacramentary of Gellone&quot;, Bibliothèque nationale de France MS Latin 12048, copied around 780. About a dozen other manuscripts of the Frankish Gelasian type are extant.

The Frankish Gelasian is a meticulous re-working of material from the Old Gelasian Sacramentary and certain other sacramentaries of the Gregorian type usually called &quot;Type 2 Gregorian&quot; (known today only from a single extant manuscript, the &quot;Paduense Sacramentary&quot;, Padua, Bibl. Cap., cod. D.47). The Gellone Sacramentary is divided into two parts. The first part includes the Temporal and Sanctoral in one continuous series, following the usual Gregorian structure, with the canon of the mass given at Easter. The second part includes the episcopal blessings and other episcopal material, prayers for monastic use, the ordo of baptism, and a summary of the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot;.

The attribution to Pope Gelasius (r. 492–496) likely derives from the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which states that Gelasius wrote various prefaces to the sacraments and prayers, but Gelasius did not compile the later sacramentary that bears his name.

Alongside the sacramentaries of the Gelasian type, all of them hybrids of Roman and Frankish practices, several older Gallican sacramentaries survive from the Merovingian period, all based on a mix of Gallican and some Irish traditions with little emphasis on Roman practices.

=== The Gregorian Sacramentary ===

We know most about the third of these books, the so-called &quot;Gregorian Sacramentary&quot;, which is in three parts:
# The Ordinary of the Mass;
# the Propers for the year beginning with Christmas Eve. They follow the ecclesiastical year; the feasts of saints (days of the month in the civil year) are incorporated in their approximate places in this. The Roman Stations are noted. There are still no Masses for the Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost;
# the prayers for ordinations.

Charlemagne, anxious to introduce the Roman Rite into his kingdom, wrote to Pope Hadrian I between the years 781 and 791 asking him to send him the service-book of the Roman Church. The book sent by the pope is the nucleus of the Gregorian Sacramentary. It was then copied a great number of times, so that there are many versions of it, all containing additions made by the various scribes. The original book sent by Hadrian to Charlemagne is easily distinguished from the different editions because the first to supplement Hadrian&#x27;s book from other sources was a conscientious person who carefully noted where his additions begin, adding a note: &quot;So far the preceding book of Sacraments is certainly that edited by the holy Pope Gregory.&quot; In the earlier versions we may take the first part, down to this note, as being the book sent by Hadrian.

However, its attribution to Pope Gregory I (590-604) shows us that Gregory did much to reform the liturgy. A constant tradition ascribes such a work to him, as to Gelasius. John the Deacon (eighth century) in his &quot;Life of Gregory&quot; expresses this tradition: &quot;He collected the Sacramentary of Gelasius in one book, leaving out much, changing little, adding something.&quot; Pope Adrian himself, in sending the book to Charlemagne, said that it was composed &quot;by our holy predecessor, the divinely speaking Pope Gregory&quot;. The fact that the essential foundation of this sacramentary goes back to St Gregory, indeed to long before his time, is certain. We do not doubt that he made such changes as those that are acclaimed to him by his biographer, and that these changes stand in this book. But his work has not remained untouched, additions have been made to it since his time. For example, the addition of his own feast as well as other feasts that had not been celebrated before the seventh century. The book sent by Pope Adrian to Charlemagne has gone through inevitable development over the centuries since Gregory finished it. It represents the Roman Rite of the time when it was sent - the eighth century. In the Frankish kingdom, copies were made for churches and additions of other Masses and prayers were added according to the specific church&#x27;s requests. These additions were taken partly from the Gelasian book, partly from Gallican sources. Though at first the additions were carefully distinguished from the original book, they were eventually incorporated in it. Between the ninth and eleventh centuries the book, including the additions, returned to Rome, took the place of the original pure Roman Rite, and so became the foundation of the Roman Missal.

==Specific manuscripts==
A non-comprehensive list of significant sacramentaries from the 7th to the 13th centuries.

===6th/7th century=== 
* Verona Sacramentary or Leonine Sacramentary, the &quot;Veronense&quot; or &quot;Leonianum&quot;, Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare Cod. LXXXV (alt 80), attributed to Pope Leo the Great (440-461) but actually copied from Roman pamphlets (&quot;libelli missarum&quot;) of the 5th and 6th centuries. This is the only manuscript of this type.
* Old Gelasian Sacramentary, Vatican Reg. lat. 316, attributed to Pope Gelasius I (492-496) but actually originating in the 6th century and dating from the early 8th century in its current form. This is the only witness to the presbyterial liturgy of Rome in the 6th century, with interpolated sections that introduce liturgical practices of Gaul from the time the manuscript was copied.
* Missale Francorum, Vatican Reg. lat. 257 (7th century), a fragment of an uncial codex of a sacramentary similar to the Old Gelasian. The fragment includes eleven masses. Although Roman in form, it is not free from Gallican interpolation, especially in the rubrics.

===7th century===
* Sacramentary of Pope Gregory the Great, a conjecturally reconstructed early sacramentary, the archetype of the Gregorian family of sacramentaries
* The &quot;Ravenna Roll&quot;, Lugano, Archivio del Principe Pio, no number. It is &quot;extremely difficult&quot; to determine the dates of this fragment, which contains about 40 prayers now associated with Advent. It may originate in the 5th century, in the time of Peter Chrysologus; the extant fragment is from the 7th century.
* &quot;Missale Gallicanum&quot; or so-called &quot;Missale Gothicum&quot;, Vatican Reg. Lat. 317 (c. 700), a sacramentary of the Merovingian-Gallican type
* &quot;Missale Gallicanum Vetus&quot;, Vatican Pal. lat. 493 (c. 700), a sacramentary of the Merovingian-Gallican type possibly related to the Missale Gothicum
* Sacramentary of Padua, Padua, Biblioteca Capitulare cod. D.47 (between 659 and 681). This mid-9th-century copy is the only extant example of the &quot;Type 2 Gregorian&quot; sacramentary

<text>Bartlehiem is a hamlet, located partially in Noardeast-Fryslân, partially in Tytsjerksteradiel, and partially in Leeuwarden. It consists of about 40 houses.

==History==
In 1840, Bartlehiem was home to 40 people. Before 2018, the village was part of the Leeuwarderadeel municipality and before 2019 part of the Ferwerderadiel municipality.

== Monastery ==
The village was first mentioned in 1232 as &quot;in Bethlehem&quot;. It was named after the Premonstratensian monastery Bethlehem, an outpost of , which was at the location between 1170 until 1580. The monastery was named after Bethlehem, Palestina.

== Elfstedentocht ==
Bartlehiem is especially well-known due to the Elfstedentocht for ice skaters, who have to pass through the hamlet twice. Coming from the west from Feinsum through the Feinsumer Feart, a wide ditch. Skaters then pass the famous wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge of Bartlehiem, after the bridge they skate north over the Dokkumer Ie to Dokkum. On return they turn left to the east over the Aldtsjerkster Feart, a similar ditch. From here it is approx 10 km to the finish line on the Bonkefeart in Leeuwarden. Due to this, Bartlehiem is the only place where a spectator can see Elfstedentocht-participants from three directions.

== Factory ==
In 1893 a dairy factory was built but it was closed in the 1950s.
The building was converted to accommodation for people with dementia in 2010.

<text>Disney Village is a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex in Disneyland Paris, located in the town of Marne-la-Vallée, France. Originally named Festival Disney, it opened on April 12, 1992, covering an area of approximately inside what was then known as Euro Disney Resort.

Based on Walt Disney World&#x27;s Disney Village Marketplace (now Disney Springs), Disney Village was designed by architect Frank Gehry with towers of oxidized silver and bronze-colored stainless steel under a canopy of lights. It is adjacent to the two theme parks of Disneyland Paris and the Lake Buena Vista hotel area.

==History==

===Original concept===

Disney specified that the primary focus of the new facility should be entertainment. It was envisioned as an attraction inside of the Euro Disney Resort, as well as a free transitional space for visitors of the Euro Disneyland theme park and train passengers from the TGV/RER station traveling to the resort hotels. The space would include numerous shops, bars, concerts, shows, and nightclubs.

The original concept was a large, open space full of life and music. It would be lit from all sides around a central avenue and include a starry sky as its crowning feature. The columns that would support this sky would be the remnants of an old power station, which had been left standing after the site had been converted.

Gehry noted:
===Changes and alterations===

Although the starry sky was generally well-received, the same could not be said for many other aspects of &quot;Festival Disney&quot;. From the beginning, guests and cast members alike criticized the project, perceiving it as having a cold, industrial, and soulless atmosphere. As a result, many changes were made to Gehry&#x27;s original concept. Metal frames that had been placed on many of the pylons were removed and replaced with statues and food counters.

In 1996, just four years after opening, &quot;Festival Disney&quot; was renamed Disney Village. Popular restaurant chain Planet Hollywood opened in front of the &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show&quot; building, and the following year an eight-screen Gaumont multiplex cinema complex opened next door to Planet Hollywood, blocking the Wild West Show&#x27;s original entrance.

Many changes and adjustments took place in existing buildings over the next 10 years, such as the opening of &quot;Café Mickey&quot; in 2002 (replacing the &quot;Los Angeles Bar &amp; Grill&quot;), the opening of &quot;King Ludwig&#x27;s Castle&quot; in 2003 (replacing &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll America&quot;), and the opening of the &quot;Rainforest Café&quot; in 1999 (replacing &quot;Key West&quot;). On January 25, 1999, a large McDonald&#x27;s fast food restaurant opened with a theme based on Italy&#x27;s Commedia dell&#x27;arte. Later in 2004, a 570-seat IMAX cinema opened as part of the Gaumont multiplex. Finally, on December 3, 2004, an Art Deco themed multi-story parking structure called &quot;VINCI Park&quot; (now Indigo) opened.

In 2004, the resort management team began renovations that would take several years to complete. The neon lights, oversized signs, and central stage were all removed from the main area. Colorfully lit balloons were added to the remaining columns for nighttime lighting. &quot;PanoraMagique&quot;, one of the largest captive balloons in the world, opened in April 2005. It carries up to 30 passengers into the sky. In 2008, resort management added large planters that contained trees, hedges, and flowers to the main thoroughfare. Terraces were added to restaurants and cafés, and the facades of buildings were updated. In the same year, a new beverage stand/snack bar was added near the entrance to Disney Village, and the tourist kiosk nearby was rebuilt in more of a neo-industrial Parisian style. In 2009, the &quot;Buffalo Trading Company&quot; closed and the premises are now occupied by a Starbucks coffee house.

As part of a €2 billion expansion of the resort, which Disney announced back in 2018, it has been confirmed that Disney Village will receive an overhaul and potential expansion. Further details have not yet been confirmed.

<doc id="1165886" wikidata="Q123202" url="?curid=1165886" title="Lehigh Valley">
<text>The Lehigh Valley () is a geographic and metropolitan region formed by the Lehigh River in Lehigh and Northampton counties in eastern Pennsylvania. It is a component valley of the Great Appalachian Valley bounded to its north by Blue Mountain, to its south by South Mountain, to its west by Lebanon Valley, and to its east by the Delaware River and Warren County, New Jersey. The Lehigh Valley is about long and wide. The Lehigh Valley&#x27;s largest city is Allentown, the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and the county seat of Lehigh County, with a population of 125,845 residents as of the 2020 census.

The Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton metropolitan area, which includes the Lehigh Valley, is Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-most populous metropolitan area after those of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and the nation&#x27;s 67th-largest metropolitan area with a population of 873,555 as of 2023. Lehigh County is among Pennsylvania&#x27;s fastest-growing counties, and the Lehigh Valley leads Pennsylvania in terms of population growth in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, which constitutes a significant portion of the labor workforce. The region&#x27;s core population centers are located in southern and central Lehigh and Northampton counties along Interstate 78, Interstate 476, Pennsylvania Route 309, and U.S. Route 22.

The Lehigh Valley has historically been a global leader in steel and other heavy manufacturing industries, which represented a considerable portion of its employment and economic production for most of the 20th century. Beginning in the early 1980s, however, the region&#x27;s heavy manufacturing sector experienced a rapid downfall, highlighted by the downsizing, bankruptcy, and ultimate closure of Bethlehem Steel, the world&#x27;s second-largest steel manufacturer for much of the 20th century, and other Lehigh Valley–based manufacturing companies. Throughout the late 20th century, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s economy struggled considerably, and it was often cited as one of the most prominent examples of the nation&#x27;s emerging Rust Belt. 

In the early 21st century, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s economy began rebounding, and it emerged as a national center for the U.S. logistics industry, especially in warehousing and intermodal transport. As of 2023, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was $ billion, led by its manufacturing sector, which comprised $9 billion, or 16 percent. In March 2024, the Lehigh Valley was named the nation&#x27;s top mid-sized market for economic development by &quot;[[Site Selection]&quot; magazine based on its number of projects that met criteria for job creation, investment, and size over the previous year.

The region&#x27;s primary commercial airport is [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] in [[Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township]], which in 2023 was utilized by 930,946 passengers and trafficked over 275,000 pounds of cargo, an all-time cargo record for the airport. 

The Lehigh Valley is located in the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis|U.S. Northeast megalopolis]], providing ease of access and close proximity to many of the nation&#x27;s largest population centers, airports, terminals, railways, and seaports, including [[New York City]], the [[List of United States cities by population|nation&#x27;s largest city]], which is to its east, and [[Philadelphia]], the nation&#x27;s sixth-most populous city, which is to its southeast. The region is located geographically within a one-day drive to over a third of the U.S. population and over half of [[Canada]]&#x27;s population, which has been a factor in its 21st century emergence as a North American leader in [[light manufacturing]] and [[Distribution (marketing)|commercial distribution]].

Since its settlement in the 18th century, the Lehigh Valley has been the birthplace or home to [[List of people from the Lehigh Valley|several notable Americans]] who have proven influential across a broad range of fields, including academia, art and music, business, government and politics, the military, professional and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athletics, and other fields.

==History==

===Colonial era===

The Lehigh Valley was settled over the first half of the 18th century largely by [[Germans|German]] immigrants fleeing war and [[religious persecution]]. Prior to their arrival, the region was inhabited by [[Lenape]] Indian tribes, who hunted, fished, and quarried [[jasper]] in the region. The region was initially established in 1682 as part of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]]. [[Shelter House]] in [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania|Emmaus]], constructed in 1734 by [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German]] settlers, is the oldest still-standing building structure in the Lehigh Valley and believed to be one of the oldest in the state. 

In 1737, sons of [[Province of Pennsylvania|provincial Pennsylvania]] founder [[William Penn]] acquired much of the Lehigh Valley in the [[Walking Purchase]] during the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial period]]. Lenape Indians subsequently retaliated with raids against European settlers in the region throughout the 1750s and early 1760s, but were moved out of the region by the mid-1760s. In 1752, the region became part of [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], and [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] was later separated from Northampton County and formally established in 1812.

===American Revolutionary War===

Allentown and its surrounding communities played an important and historic role in the emergence of the [[American Revolution]]. Some of the first resistance to [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonialism]] began in Allentown and its surrounding [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] communities in the Lehigh Valley. As early as June 21, 1774, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot forces]] in Allentown began meeting to formulate resistance plans to British colonial governance. On December 21, 1774, a [[Committee of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Observation]] was formally established by Allentown-area patriot militias. Following the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Colonial British government]] in Allentown began dissolving and these patriot militias seized control, pressuring [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] out of the region. 

In recognition of the strong pro-revolutionary sentiment in the region, [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] was one of only three designated locations, along with Philadelphia and [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where the Declaration was read aloud in public for the first time on July 8, 1776 at noon.

Following their victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]] several months later, [[George Washington|Washington]] and his [[Continental Army]] staff traveled through the present-day Lehigh Valley, proceeding up [[Lehigh Street]], which was then called Water Street. Washington and his staff stopped at the foot of Lehigh Street at a large spring on what is the present-day Wire Mill Arboretum in Allentown. They rested there, watered their horses, and then proceeded to their post of duty. Allentown supported the Revolution, establishing the first hospitals for treatment of wounded Continental Army troops at various city locations, including at the current location of the [[Farr Building]] at 739 [[Hamilton Street]].

As the Revolutionary War progressed, Washington and his commanders also established two [[prisoner of war|POW]] camps in Allentown, one at 8th and Hamilton streets and another on Gordon Street, to house captured [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian mercenaries]]. In addition to visiting Allentown after his victory at the Battle of Trenton, Washington returned to the city and region several additional times during and following the Revolution.

Allentown also played a historical role in protecting the [[Liberty Bell]] from British capture following the [[Philadelphia campaign|fall of Philadelphia]] to the [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] on September 26, 1777, concealing the Liberty Bell for nine months from September 1777 to June 1778 under floor boards in Allentown&#x27;s [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion Reformed Church]]. After Washington and the Continental Army&#x27;s defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was left defenseless and [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council]], anticipating Philadelphia&#x27;s fall, ordered that eleven Philadelphia bells, including the Liberty Bell, then known as the State House Bell, be taken down and moved to present-day Allentown, which was then called Northampton Towne. In Allentown, the Liberty Bell and other bells were hidden under floorboards at [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion Reformed Church]] on West Hamilton Street to protect them from being seized and melted down by the British Army for use as munitions.

===American Civil War===

The region again proved influential in the [[American Civil War]]. Following the [[Union Army]]&#x27;s defeat at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] and [[President Lincoln&#x27;s 75,000 volunteers|Lincoln&#x27;s April 15, 1861 proclamation]] calling for state militia to provide 75,000 volunteers to defend the national capital in [[Washington, D.C.]], Allentown immediately deployed its Allen Infantry, which defended Washington, D.C. from [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack following [[Fort Sumter]]&#x27;s fall. Also known as the Allen Guards, the Allen Infantry mustered in for duty on April 18, 1861. During the late summer and early fall of 1861, members of this unit and other volunteers from within and beyond the Lehigh Valley came together to form the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]], which was established on August 5 and later proved influential in expanding the Union Army&#x27;s reach into the [[Deep South]], permitting it to launch successful attacks against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] positions in the [[Battle of St. Johns Bluff]] in 1862 and throughout the [[Red River campaign]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi theater]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]]&#x27;s [[Valley campaigns of 1864|Shenadoah Valley campaign]] across Virginia in 1864. These victories helped to tip the Civil War in the Union&#x27;s favor. 

On October 19, 1899, a monument in honor of the Lehigh Valley men killed in their volunteer service to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]&#x27;s preservation, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, was erected at Seventh and [[Hamilton Street|Hamilton]] streets in [[Center City Allentown]], where it still stands.

===Industrial Revolution===
The opening of the [[Lehigh Canal]] in 1827 contributed significantly to transforming Allentown and the Lehigh Valley from a rural agricultural area dominated by [[German language|German]]-speaking people into one of the nation&#x27;s first urbanized industrialized areas. The Lehigh Valley underwent significant [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] throughout the 19th and most of the 20th centuries and was a major manufacturing hub in the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|American Industrial Revolution]].

The Lehigh Valley is named for the [[Lehigh River]], which runs through the region. It owes much of its development and history to [[anthracite|anthracite coal]], [[lumber|timber]], and [[ore]] that was only commercially possible with the development of the Lehigh Canal and the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s extensive railway infrastructure that permitted these minerals and later the region&#x27;s manufactured steel to be transported for sale in major national and overseas markets. 

The Lehigh Canal operated into the [[Great Depression]], feeding ports up and down the [[Delaware River]], the [[Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division)|Pennsylvania Canal]], and transoceanic demand, and was integral to the industrialization of the greater [[Delaware Valley]] region. [[Morris Canal]], the [[anthracite|anthracite coal]] feeder of [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]]. and locks at [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]] on the [[Delaware Canal]] were built to fuel anthracite energy needs of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and New York City.

In 1899, [[Bethlehem Steel]] was formed in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] in the Lehigh Valley. The company developed into the nation&#x27;s second-largest manufacturer of [[steel]], and its steel was used in developing many of the nation&#x27;s earliest and largest infrastructure and building projects, including the [[Empire State Building]], [[Madison Square Garden]], and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, [[Merchandise Mart]] in [[Chicago]], the [[George Washington Bridge|George Washington]], [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano]], and [[Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate]] Bridges, and [[warship]]s and other military equipment that proved essential in American-led victories in both world wars.

===Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s downfall===

During the 20th century, [[Bethlehem Steel]]&#x27;s ascent was prominently associated with the emergence of the U.S. as both a world leader in global manufacturing and as the world&#x27;s largest economy, and its late 20th century downfall has often been cited as an example of one of the nation&#x27;s most prominent first stumbling points in the face of growing foreign trade competition and other economic challenges that contributed to the nation&#x27;s emergence of its [[Rust Belt]].

In 1982, following nearly a century of global leadership, growth, and profitability in steel manufacturing, Bethlehem Steel abruptly reported operating losses of $1.5 billion, citing foreign competition from [[Asia]]n economies and costly U.S. governmental regulations and labor costs for the losses. The company abruptly reduced operations, resulting in considerable Lehigh Valley layoffs and a dramatic related economic downturn in the region. 

Bethlehem Steel continued functioning on a vastly reduced scale for a period, but ultimately ceased steel manufacturing entirely at its primary [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]-based manufacturing plant in 1995. In 2001, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and, in 2003, the company was dissolved. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the downturn and ultimate demise of Bethlehem Steel, once one of the most iconic and prominent symbols of American global economic power and leadership, emerged as an example cited by those who believe American global economic leadership is now in either gradual or even rapid descent.

===21st century===
In 2023, &quot;[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]&quot; ranked the Lehigh Valley the ninth-best place in the nation to retire. Also in 2023, [[realtor.com]] ranked the Lehigh Valley &quot;the 21st hottest housing market&quot; in the nation.

==Geography==

The Lehigh Valley is [[geology|geologically]] and [[geography|geographically]] part of the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], a geographic region made up of [[limestone]] that stretches along the eastern edge of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The Lehigh Valley is so named because it is located geographically within an actual [[valley]] formed by the [[Lehigh River]] that lies between two mountain ridges, [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] in the Valley&#x27;s north and [[South Mountain (Eastern Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] in the Valley&#x27;s south. The Lehigh Valley is the lower part of the [[drainage basin]] of the Lehigh River.

== Cities and location ==

The Lehigh Valley has three principal cities: Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton. The region is located between two of the nation&#x27;s largest population centers, west of [[New York City]], the nation&#x27;s [[List of United States cities by population|largest]] and [[List of largest cities|world&#x27;s 11th-largest]] city, and north of [[Philadelphia]], the nation&#x27;s [[List of United States cities by population|sixth-largest]] and [[List of largest cities|world&#x27;s 68th-largest]] city.
The region borders [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]] and the [[Coal Region]] to its north, the [[Delaware River]] and [[Warren County, New Jersey]] to its east, [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties in suburban Philadelphia to its south, and [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] and [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill]] Counties to its west.

== Metropolitan and Combined Statistical Areas ==

The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area is a [[Metropolitan statistical area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] that includes [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]] in the [[Coal Region]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] counties in the Lehigh Valley, and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] in the [[Skylands Region|Skylands]] region of northwest [[New Jersey]]. As of 2023 census estimates, it is the [[Metropolitan statistical area|67th-largest metropolitan area]] in the nation with a population of 873,555.

In July 2023, the area was added to the newly created [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]-[[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]-[[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|East Stroudsburg]] PA-NJ [[Combined statistical area|Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA). This area also includes [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] in the [[Pocono Mountains]] region of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the Allentown-Bethlehem-East Stroudsburg, PA-NJ CSA had a population of 1,030,216, the 59th-largest CSA in the nation.

== Climate ==

The Lehigh Valley has four distinct seasons, which typically include hot and humid summers, cold winters, and short and mild springs and falls. It has a [[humid continental climate]] (&quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dfb&quot;) and the [[hardiness zone]] ranges from 5b in higher elevation locations in northern [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]] to 6b (the principal zone in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]], [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]], and southern [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] Counties). The 1991-2020 hardiness zone for the airport and lower elevations is 7a. 
==Demographics==

The Lehigh Valley has a total population of 861,889 residents as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 U.S. census]], making it the [[Pennsylvania metropolitan areas|third-largest metropolitan area in Pennsylvania]] and [[Metropolitan statistical area|68th-largest metropolitan area]] in the nation.

A 2018 [[American Community Survey]] conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] found that 87.1% of the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s population was [[White American]], 4.6% was [[Black people|Black]] or African American, 0.1% was [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]], 2.3% was Asian American, 0.1% was [[Native Hawaiian]], 0.1% were [[Pacific Islander Americans]], 4.3% were of some other race, and 1.5% belonged to two or more races. [[Hispanics]] and Latinos of any race made up 11.3% of the population and represent the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s fastest-growing demographic. [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] is in the top 1% of all U.S. counties for inward migration from international locations, according to [[SelectUSA Investment Summit|Select USA]], a [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] program. The Lehigh Valley as a whole leads Pennsylvania in terms of population growth in the 18-to-34 year old demographic, according to 2020 census data.

The Lehigh Valley&#x27;s population growth is partly a result of a growing influx of residents from [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] drawn to the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s lower cost of living, its employment opportunities, and its close proximity to Philadelphia and New York City, the nation&#x27;s sixth and largest cities, respectively. The Valley&#x27;s population is expected to increase by 227,000 people by 2040, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in the state and nation.

Median household income for the region increased from $57,288 to $81,709 between 2015 and 2024. 

== Economy ==

The Lehigh Valley&#x27;s economy has been known historically and globally for its leadership throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in heavy manufacturing. Beginning in the 1980s, however, the region&#x27;s manufacturing sector declined rapidly as a result of foreign competition, trade practices, operational costs, regulations, and other factors. The most prominent example was the plight of [[Bethlehem Steel]], the world&#x27; second-largest manufacturer of steel for much of the 20th century. Headquartered in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], Bethlehem Steel abruptly suspended most of its operations in the early 1980s, declared bankruptcy in 2001, and was dissolved in 2003.

Since the late 20th century, the Lehigh Valley has recovered and evolved substantially from the loss of its once powerful manufacturing and steel production base with other industry sectors having emerged in the region, providing a much more diversified regional economy. The region has frequently been cited and heralded nationally as a [[rust belt]] success story for this dramatic revitalization. It has been named as one of the top 5 best performing mid-sized markets in the country repeatedly since at least 2014 and the top performing mid-sized market in the country as of 2023 per Site Selection Magazine.

As of 2020, the Valley&#x27;s top five industries were finance, manufacturing, health care and education, professional and business services, and information. Other major industry sectors in the area include transportation, retail trade, and restaurants and hospitality. In 2023 the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s total [[gross domestic product]] was $55.7 billion. The Lehigh Valley boasts a workforce of over 365,900 people residing within the region and over 1.7M people residing within a one-hour commute of the region as of 2023. 

===Bethlehem Steel===

The Lehigh Valley is known historically for its production of [[steel]], [[Portland cement]], [[silk]], and [[clothing|apparel]]. [[Bethlehem Steel]], founded in 1899 and based in Bethlehem, was a foundation of the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s economy for nearly a century from 1899 through the early 1980s. At the pinnacle of its success, Bethlehem Steel was the nation&#x27;s second-largest and one of the world&#x27;s largest steel manufacturers. Bethlehem Steel was instrumental in the development of many of the nation&#x27;s most prominent 20th century infrastructure projects. Its steel was used to build [[28 Liberty Street]], [[Chrysler Building]], the [[Empire State Building]], [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Rockefeller Center]], and the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria]] hotel in New York City and [[Merchandise Mart]] in [[Chicago]]. Among major bridges, the company&#x27;s steel was used to construct the [[George Washington Bridge]] and [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]] in New York City, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco]], and the [[Peace Bridge]] between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Fort Erie, Ontario]]. The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] relied heavily on Bethlehem Steel during [[World War II]], utilizing the company to produce the steel necessary for shipbuilding, ammunition, and other military equipment that proved essential to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]&#x27; ability to prevail in these conflicts.

In the late 20th century, however, a variety of factors, including the practices of foreign competitors, began eroding Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s once historical global leadership in [[steelmaking]]. In 1982, the company announced it was discontinuing most of its operations. In 2001, the company declared bankruptcy. In 2003, it was dissolved. Throughout the late 20th century, other heavy manufacturing companies in the Lehigh Valley that once served as backbones for the region&#x27;s economy suffered similarly, either downsizing significantly or dissolving, which destabilized the region considerably.

In the early 2000s, seeking to replace the heavy manufacturing companies that had been the region&#x27;s foundation for decades, the Lehigh Valley began developing other economic sectors, including financial services, health care, life sciences, and technology. The Lehigh Valley also began emerging as a national warehouse and distribution hub, due in part to its proximity to many of the largest U.S. markets and relatively lower operating costs compared to other [[Northeast United States|Northeast U.S.]] regions. More recently, a movement to reestablish manufacturing activities in the U.S., driven by customer demand for American-made products, faster product delivery, increased overseas wages, and inflated costs and extended timeframes for shipping has led to some renewed growth in the Valley&#x27;s manufacturing sector. Several large companies from [[China]] and [[Germany]] have invested tens of millions of dollars into developing significant operations in the Lehigh Valley, which has generated thousands of new jobs in the region.

=== Largest employers ===
As of 2024, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s five top private sector employers are: 1.) [[Lehigh Valley Health Network]] (headquartered in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]); 2.) [[St. Luke&#x27;s University Health Network|St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital and Health Network]] (headquartered in [[Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania|Fountain Hill]]); 3.) [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] (with a square foot facility in [[Palmer Township, Pennsylvania|Palmer Township]]); 4.) [[Mack Trucks]] (with manufacturing headquarters in [[Macungie, Pennsylvania|Macungie]]); and 5.) [[Air Products]] (globally headquartered in [[Trexlertown, Pennsylvania|Trexlertown]]).

=== Business and economic environment ===
The Lehigh Valley is one of the fastest-growing and largest economies in Pennsylvania and the United States with a total [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of $55.7 billion (as of 2023) that saw a four percent increase between 2022 and 2023 alone driven by strong manufacturing, financial, health care, and professional services industry segments. It was named in March 2024 as the top mid-sized market in America by Site Selection Magazine for economic development based on the number of projects that met certain criteria for job creation, investment and size in 2023.

It is centrally located in the [[Northeast megalopolis]] with ease of access and close proximity to several of the largest U.S. markets, population centers, airports, terminals, railways, and seaports, including the New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. The Lehigh Valley is within a one-day drive to over a third of the U.S. population and to over half the population of [[Canada]]. The Valley has a lower cost of living, more affordable real estate, lower taxes, and a larger and more affordable labor pool than many other [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] metropolitan regions. These attributes and others, including sizable investments in business development incentive programs and a friendlier regulatory environment, provide the area with a comparatively favorable business climate compared to surrounding metropolitan areas.

Due in large part to this comparably favorable business climate and mature business support programs, the Lehigh Valley has been very successful in luring established businesses as well as new [[Startup company|startup companies]] from higher cost areas such as New York and New Jersey, generating thousands of new jobs and significant new investments in the region. Large companies such as [[Amazon.com]] have praised the Lehigh Valley for its commitment to business support, infrastructure investment, and incentive programs, citing these as major reasons for their continuing expansions and increased hiring in the region and [[Allegiant Air]], a low-cost budget airline, opened a new flight base at the [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] in February 2020, noting the area&#x27;s rapid growth, lower operational business costs, and its proximity to popular destinations as significant reasons for expanding their Lehigh Valley International Airport flights.

Other large national and international companies either based in the Lehigh Valley or with significant operations there include [[Broadcom Corporation]] (in Allentown), Avantor Performance Materials (in Allentown), [[Air Products]] (in [[Trexlertown, Pennsylvania|Trexlertown]]), [[Crayola]] (in Easton), [[Buckeye Partners]] (in [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania|Emmaus]]), [[HeidelbergCement]] (in [[Fogelsville, Pennsylvania|Fogelsville]]), [[Just Born]] (in Bethlehem, maker of [[Peeps]] candies), [[Mack Trucks]] (in Allentown), [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin Guitar]] (in [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]]), [[Olympus Corporation]] (in [[Center Valley, Pennsylvania|Center Valley]]), [[OraSure Technologies]] (in Bethlehem), [[PPL Corporation]] (in Allentown), [[Wind Creek Bethlehem]] (in Bethlehem), [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] (in Center Valley), [[Victaulic]] (in Easton), and others.

In 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Lehigh Valley was recognized by &quot;[[Site Selection]]&quot; magazine as the second-best performing region of its size for economic development in the nation and the best performing region in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast U.S.]]. It was ranked by &quot;[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]&quot; in 2015 as one of the top 10 best places in the U.S. to locate corporate [[finance]] and [[information technology]] operations, including call and IT support centers. Allentown, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s largest city, was cited as a &quot;national success story&quot; in April 2016 by the [[Urban Land Institute]] for its downtown redevelopment and transformation that has led to $1 billion worth of new development projects there between 2015 and 2019, one of only six communities nationally to achieve this distinction.

The Lehigh Valley is one of the leading areas on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for [[warehouse]]s and [[distribution center]]s. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as the nation&#x27;s &quot;second [[Inland Empire]]&quot; for freight. Large national companies that own and operate warehouses and distribution centers in the Lehigh Valley include [[Amazon.com]], [[B. Braun Melsungen|B. Braun]], [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Boston Beer Company]] (brewer of [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams]] brand beer), [[BMW]], [[Bridgestone]], [[FedEx SmartPost]], [[FedEx Ground]], [[Home Depot]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Nestlé Purina PetCare|Nestlé Purina]], [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]], [[Stitch Fix]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], Phillips Pet Food and Supplies, [[True Value]], [[Uline]], [[Zulily]], and others. Most of these warehouses and distribution centers are located along the Valley&#x27;s southern [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], [[Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 78]], and [[Interstate 476]] corridors, which provide direct access to numerous major markets throughout the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast U.S.]] and beyond.

In September 2018, [[FedEx Ground]] constructed their largest distribution hub in the country near Lehigh Valley International Airport at a cost of $335 million. This hub can process up to 45,000 packages per hour and employs over 2,000 people. By 2030, it is expected to have a total size of square feet and employ over 3,000 people.

The Boston Beer Company operates its largest U.S. production brewery facility in [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania|Breinigsville]] in the Lehigh Valley, which produces over 2/3rds of all [[Samuel Adams beer]] globally. The company continues to upgrade and expand operations at this facility and has cited the location as central to its overall corporate success. Additionally, [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], a popular maker of juice drinks and other fruit products, produces 40 percent of its total national beverage volume at its Lehigh Valley plant in Breinigsville. Due to Pennsylvania&#x27;s lack of an excise tax on [[cigar]]s and the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s close proximity to major markets, the region is home to some of the nation&#x27;s largest cigar distributors and retailers.

=== Retail shopping ===
The largest retail shopping area in the Lehigh Valley is the [[Pennsylvania Route 145|PA Route 145/MacArthur Road]] corridor, just north of Allentown in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]], which is anchored by [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] and [[Whitehall Mall]].

In October 2006, [[The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley]], located off [[Pennsylvania Route 309|Route 309]] in [[Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]] in the Lehigh Valley, opened. The Promenade is roughly half the size of the Lehigh Valley Mall but features higher end stores not available in Lehigh Valley Mall.

<doc id="1165894" wikidata="Q6533280" url="?curid=1165894" title="Lethbridge-East">
<text>Lethbridge-East is a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, covering the eastern half of the city of Lethbridge. The district is one of 87 in the province mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting.

The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution when the old Lethbridge district was split into this district and Lethbridge-West.

The current representative for Lethbridge-East is United Conservative Nathan Neudorf, who won his first term on April 16, 2019. Prior to him it was held by New Democrat Maria Fitzpatrick, from 2015 to 2019, Liberal-turned-PC Bridget Pastoor from 2004 to 2015 and Liberal Ken Nicol from 1993 to 2004. Progressive Conservatives and Social Credit representatives have also held this district in the past.

==History==
The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution when the old electoral district of Lethbridge was split in half.

The 2010 boundary redistribution made some minor revisions to equalize the population between West and East. North of St. Edward Blvd the boundary was pushed west from 13 Street to Stafford Drive.

===Boundary history===


===Representation history===
The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution. The first election that year saw a hotly contested race between Social Credit candidate John Anderson and Progressive Conservative candidate Richard Barton. Anderson won by just under a thousand votes to pick up the new seat for his party despite Social Credit losing government that year.

Anderson would be defeated in the 1975 general election by Archibald Johnston who won in a landslide. He would be appointed to the provincial cabinet by Premier Peter Lougheed after the election. He was re-elected to his second term in the 1979 election with a smaller majority.

The 1982 general election saw Johnston win the biggest majority of his career and the history of the district. He was re-elected to a fourth term in the 1986 general election and a fifth term in the 1989 general election. He held a cabinet post until 1992 when Ralph Klein became Premier. He retired at dissolution of the assembly in 1993.

The 1993 general election saw Liberal candidate Ken Nicol elected here in a closely contested race. Nicol won re-election in 1997 with a larger majority. He held his seat for a third term in the 2001 election and became Liberal leader later that year. Nicol resigned on May 25, 2004, to run for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2004 Canadian federal election.

The 2004 election saw Liberal candidate Bridget Pastoor win a closely contested race over Rod Fong to hold the district for her party. She was re-elected in 2008 as a Liberal, but crossed the floor to the Tories in 2011 and was reelected as a Tory in 2012. In 2015, Pastoor announced she would not seek re-election in the 2015 general election.

The 2015 election saw Maria Fitzpatrick of the NDP elected as MLA for Lethbridge-East. However, she was defeated after one term in office by Nathan Neudorf of the United Conservative Party on April 16, 2019.

On November 19, 2004, a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="1165897" wikidata="Q2257072" url="?curid=1165897" title="Sweet Oblivion">
<text>Sweet Oblivion is the sixth studio album by Screaming Trees, released on September 8, 1992. It quickly became the band&#x27;s best-selling record, and was the closest they ever came to achieving mainstream success. &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; sold in excess of 300,000 copies on the strength of the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot;. The song benefited from an appearance on &quot;&quot;, a Top Ten, platinum-selling hit album which featured many other popular Seattle-based music acts from the period.

Around the time of the recording of the album, the band’s original drummer Mark Pickerel left to pursue other musical interests, and was replaced with Barrett Martin.

Nearly four years passed in between &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; and the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Dust&quot;, a move that hurt much of the band&#x27;s commercial momentum.

<doc id="1165902" wikidata="Q653790" url="?curid=1165902" title="Law of Singapore">
<text>The legal system of Singapore is based on the English common law system. Major areas of law – particularly administrative law, contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law – are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. However, other areas of law, such as criminal law, company law and family law, are largely statutory in nature.

Apart from referring to relevant Singaporean cases, judges continue to refer to English case law where the issues pertain to a traditional common-law area of law, or involve the interpretation of Singaporean statutes based on English enactments or English statutes applicable in Singapore. In more recent times, there is also a greater tendency to consider decisions of important Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada, as the Singapore Courts tend to consider decisions based on their logic, rather than their provenance.

Certain Singapore statutes are not based on English enactments but on legislation from other jurisdictions. In such situations, court decisions from those jurisdictions on the original legislation are often examined. Thus, Indian law is sometimes consulted in the interpretation of the and the which were based on Indian statutes.

On the other hand, where the interpretation of the is concerned, courts remain reluctant to take into account foreign legal materials on the basis that a constitution should primarily be interpreted within its own four walls rather than in the light of analogies from other jurisdictions; and because economic, political, social and other conditions in foreign countries are perceived as different.

Certain laws such as the (which authorises detention without trial in certain circumstances) and the (which regulates the formation of associations) remain in the statute book, and both corporal and capital punishment are still in use.

Modern Singapore was founded on 6 February 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, an officer of the British East India Company and Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, in an attempt to counter Dutch domination of trade in the East. Permission for the East India Company to set up a &quot;factory&quot; on the island was obtained from the Sultan of Johor and Temenggung of Johor on that date under the terms of the Treaty of Singapore, and outright cession of Singapore took place in 1824. It has been suggested that prior to British acquisition of the island, the Malay chief in charge of Singapore was the Temenggung of Johor. The Johor Sultanate was the successor of the Malacca Sultanate, both of which had their own codes of law. It is also possible that adat law, often inadequately translated as &quot;customary law&quot;, governed the inhabitants of the island prior to its acquisition by the British. However, little, if anything, is known about the laws that were actually applicable. The British have always assumed that no law prevailed on the island of Singapore when it was acquired.

In 1823 Raffles promulgated &quot;Regulations&quot; for the administration of the island. Regulation III of 20 January 1823 established a magistracy which had jurisdiction over &quot;all descriptions of persons resorting under the British flag&quot;. The magistrates were enjoined to &quot;follow the course of the British magistracy, as far as local circumstances permit, avoiding technicalities and unnecessary forms as much as possible, and executing the duties of their office with temper and discretion, according to the best of their judgement and conscience and the principles of substantial justice&quot;. Raffles&#x27; Regulations were most likely illegal as he was acting beyond the scope of his legal powers in making them – although he had power to place the factory at Singapore under the jurisdiction of Bencoolen, he was not vested with power to place the entire island under Bencoolen&#x27;s control. In this respect, he had treated Singapore as if the entire island had been ceded to the British when the Treaty with the Sultan and the Temenggung had only permitted the establishment of a trading factory.

The same year, Raffles appointed John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd doubted the legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident&#x27;s Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on &quot;general principles of English law&quot;, taking into account so far as he could the &quot;character and manners of the different classes&quot; of local inhabitants. Unfortunately, Crawfurd&#x27;s courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, all he could do was to banish them from the island.

Despite the dubious legal status of the courts established in Singapore by Raffles and Crawfurd, they indicate that the &quot;de facto&quot; position was that between 1819 and 1826 English legal principles applied to Singapore.

On 24 June 1824 Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company&#x27;s administration by the Transfer of Singapore to East India Company, etc. Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 108 (UK)). By virtue of the Fort Marlborough in India Act 1802 (42 Geo. 3. c. 29 (UK)). both territories, together with others in the region ceded to Britain by the Netherlands, became subordinate to the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal, and under the Government of India Act 1800 these territories became subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Fort William.

The Indian Salaries and Pensions Act 1825 authorised the East India Company to place Singapore and Malacca under the administration of Prince of Wales&#x27; Island (now Penang). The Company did so, thus creating the Straits Settlements.

===1826–1867: The &quot;Indian period&quot;===
The statute 6 Geo. 4 c. 85 empowered the British Crown to issue letters patent providing for the administration of justice in the Straits Settlements. The East India Company petitioned the Crown for the grant of such letters patent establishing &quot;such Courts and Judicatures for the due administration of Justice and the security of the persons rights and property of the Inhabitants and the Public Revenue of and the Trial and Punishment of Capital and other Offences committed and the repression of vice within the said Settlement of Prince of Wales’ Island Singapore and Malacca…&quot;

Granting the petition, the Crown issued the Second Charter of Justice on 27 November 1826. The Charter established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales&#x27; Island, Singapore and Malacca, which was conferred &quot;full Power and Authority… to give and pass Judgement and Sentence according to Justice and Right&quot;. This key clause was later judicially interpreted to have introduced English law into the Straits Settlements. The present understanding of this clause is that it made all English statutes and principles of English common law and equity in force as at 27 November 1826 applicable in the Straits Settlements (including Singapore), unless they were both unsuitable to local conditions and could not be modified to avoid causing injustice or oppression.

The Charter provided that the Court of Judicature was to be presided over by the Governor of the Straits Settlements and Resident Councillor of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the Recorder. Problems occurred with the first Recorder, Sir John Thomas Claridge. He complained that the Governor and Resident Councillors had refused to take any judicial business, and so responded by also refusing to take on the full business of the Court. He also bemoaned the lack of a &quot;full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters. etc.&quot; Although expected to travel from his base at Prince of Wales&#x27; Island to Singapore and Malacca, due to disputes over travelling expenses and arrangements, Claridge refused to do so. Thus, on 22 May 1828 the Governor Robert Fullerton, together with the Resident Councillor Kenneth Murchison, were obliged to hold the first assizes in Singapore by themselves. Claridge was eventually recalled to the UK in 1829.

The Charter conferred no legislative power on the Governor and Council of Prince of Wales&#x27; Island or, indeed, on any other individual or institution. The general power to make laws was vested with the Supreme Government of India and the British Parliament. By the East India Company Act 1813 (also known as the Charter Act 1813) (53 Geo. 3. c. 155 (UK)), Prince of Wales&#x27; Island itself had been conferred an extremely limited power to issue regulations relating to duties and taxes it was empowered to levy; pursuant to this power, it issued nine regulations that applied to the Straits Settlements. However, on 20 June 1830 the East India Company reduced the status of Prince of Wales&#x27; Island from a Presidency to a Residency. The island thus lost power to legislate for the Straits Settlements, which power was assumed by the Governor General of Bengal. He issued four such regulations applicable to the Straits Settlements.

Upon the downgrading of the Straits Settlements, the offices of Governor and Resident Councillors were abolished. This led Governor Fullerton to conclude that neither he nor the Resident Councillors were empowered any longer to administer justice under the Second Charter. In late 1830, Fullerton closed the courts and dismissed the judicial establishment before leaving for England. This led to legal chaos. Members of the mercantile community were in an uproar as they felt the ensuing confusion and inconvenience of having no local courts would disrupt commercial activity. In Singapore the Deputy Resident Murchison felt compelled to convene a court. However, the Acting Registrar James Loch took the view that the court was illegal, and it was soon closed again. In September 1831 merchants of the Straits Settlements appealed to the British Parliament. By then, the East India Company had already decided that Fullerton had been mistaken. It decided to restore the titles of Governor and Resident Councillor so that these officers could continue to administer justice pursuant to the Charter. On 9 June 1832 the Court of Judicature reopened at Prince of Wales&#x27; Island, and disposed of many outstanding cases that had amassed during the two years when the courts were closed.

In 1833, the Government of India Act 1833 (also known as the Charter Act 1833) (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 85]] (UK)). was passed by the British Parliament for the better government of the East India Company&#x27;s possessions. Sole legislative power was transferred to the Governor General of India in Council, thus inaugurating the period of Straits Settlements history known as the period of the &quot;Indian Acts&quot;.

The Court of Judicature was reorganised by the Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855. The Straits Settlements now had two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales&#x27; Island, the other for Singapore and Malacca.

In 1858 the East India Company was abolished, and territories formerly administered by the Company were transferred to the Crown acting through the recently appointed Secretary of State for India. This was effected by the Government of India Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. 106 (UK)). There was no change to the structure of the legal system – the Governor General of India continued to legislate for the Straits Settlements.

Unfortunately, many Acts passed by the Governor General during this period were not relevant to the Straits Settlements, and it was difficult to determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to inquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts considered in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable forthwith.

===1867–1942: The Straits Settlements as a Crown colony===
On 1 April 1867, the Straits Settlements were detached from India and constituted as a separate Crown colony by way of the Straits Settlements Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 115 (UK)). A separate Legislative Council with the authority to make laws was set up for the Straits Settlements. Pieces of legislation passed by the Legislative Council were known as &quot;ordinances&quot;.

By the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (S.S.), the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements was abolished, and in its place the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. The Governor and Resident Councillors ceased to be judges of the Court.

In 1873, the Supreme Court was reconstituted to consist of the Chief Justice and the Judge at Penang as well as a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge. There were two divisions of the court, one at Singapore and Malacca and the other at Penang. As Singapore had become the Straits Settlements&#x27; centre of government and trade, the Chief Justice and Senior Puisne Judge were required to reside in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge resided in Penang. The Supreme Court was also conferred with jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal in civil matters. Following changes in the court structure in England, in 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court. The first hierarchy of courts was also established, consisting of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Courts of Request, Courts of Two Magistrates, Magistrates&#x27; Courts, Coroners&#x27; Courts and Justices of the Peace. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and then to Her Majesty in Council, the latter appeals being heard by the Judicial Committee of Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council.

Also in 1878, a provision later known as section 5 of the Civil Law Act was introduced into Straits Settlements law. The provision stated that if a question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to mercantile law generally, the law to be administered was to be the same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless other provision had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire. However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally. Despite major amendments to the provision in 1979, the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 (see below).

Under the Courts Ordinance Amendment 1885 (S.S.), the set-up of the Supreme Court was again altered so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. In 1907 the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was given a major overhaul. The Court was split into two divisions – a Civil Division and a Criminal Division, each with both original and appellate jurisdiction. District Courts and Police Courts, which replaced the Magistrates&#x27; Courts, were also established. The Court of Requests, the jurisdiction of which had been drastically reduced in the intervening years, was abolished. The last major changes in the court system before World War II took place in 1934 when a Court of Criminal Appeal, essentially an extension of the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction, was created, and in 1936 when it was declared that the Supreme Court would consist of a High Court and Court of Appeal.

===1942–1946: Singapore under Japanese and British Military Administration===
During World War II, Singapore fell under Japanese Military Administration on 15 February 1942. There is much confusion as to where legislative authority lay, as there were several government or military bodies which had the power to make laws. These were, in order of descending authority, the Supreme Command of the Southern Army Headquarters, the 25th Army Headquarters, the Military Administration Department, the Malay (Malayan) Military Administration Headquarters, and the City Government of Tokubetu-si. Numerous regulations, laws and notices were issued by all these bodies through the Tokubetu-si without adhering to the normal chain of command. Although these laws were often contradictory, the body higher in the hierarchy always prevailed.

When the Japanese occupation of Singapore began, all existing courts ceased to function. By a decree of 7 April 1942, a Military Court of Justice of the Nippon Army was established, and the civil courts were reopened by a proclamation dated 27 May. This Proclamation made all former British laws applicable so long as they did not interfere with the Military Administration. The highest court was the Syonan Koto-Hoin (Syonan Supreme Court) which was opened on 29 May. Although a court of appeal was constituted, it never sat.

There is some disagreement as to the status of judgments handed down by courts during the Japanese Occupation. The view has been taken by some post-Occupation courts that decisions by Japanese tribunals applying the law were valid. Others have held that since the Japanese administration did not set up tribunals in compliance with the requirements of Straits Settlements law, while the law continued to apply there were no proper courts in existence to enforce it.

The Japanese surrendered on 12 September 1945. By Proclamation No. 1 (1945), the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia established the British Military Administration which assumed full judicial, legislative, executive and administrative powers and responsibilities and conclusive jurisdiction over all persons and property throughout such areas of Malaya as were at any given time under the control of forces under his command. The proclamation also declared that all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese Occupation would be respected, except that such of the existing law as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer considered practicable to administer during the period of military administration. Otherwise, all proclamations and legislative enactments of whatever kind issued by or under the authority of the Japanese Military Administration ceased to have effect.

By Proclamation No. 23 (1945), the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer for the Singapore Division provided that every conviction of any offence by a tribunal established by the Japanese Military Administration was quashed, and any judgment convicting or purporting to convict any person or any offence was set aside. Civil proceedings were dealt with by the Japanese Judgements and Civil Proceedings Ordinance 1946 (No. 3 of 1946), which had the effect of permitting post-Occupation courts to review the decrees of Japanese tribunals and to confirm, modify or reverse them.

===1946–1963: The end of the Straits Settlements: Singapore as a separate colony and self-governing state===
The British Military Administration was terminated by Proclamation No. 77 (1946) dated 18 March 1946, and with effect from 1 April, the Straits Settlements were disbanded by the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6 c. 37 (UK)). By the Singapore Colony Order in Council 1946, Singapore was constituted as a new colony under the British Settlements Acts 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 54 (UK)). A Singapore Legislative Council was created with power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Colony. The High Court and Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements became the Colony of Singapore High Court and Court of Appeal.

In 1958 Singapore was granted internal self-government and became the State of Singapore. This change was put into place by the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958 made under powers conferred by the State of Singapore Act 1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2. c. 59 (UK)). The Legislative Council was transformed into a Legislative Assembly consisting mainly of elected members.

During this period, the basic structure of the courts remained much as it had been in the pre-war colonial era, with only minor changes being made such as the redesignation of the Police Courts as Magistrates&#x27; Courts in 1955.

===1963–1965: Independence from the British Empire and merger with Malaysia===
Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, and thus ceased to be a colony of the British empire. The legal arrangements were effected by the enactment of the Malaysia Act 1963 (c. 35 (UK)). the Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963 and the Malaysia Act 1963 (Malaysia). The 1963 Order in Council provided that all laws in force in Singapore continued to apply subject to modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions that might be necessary to bring them into conformity with its new Constitution and the Malaysia Act. With Singapore now a state in a larger federation, the Singapore Legislative Assembly was transformed into the Legislature of Singapore with power to make laws only regarding certain matters set out in the Malaysian Federal Constitution. Article 75 of the Federal Constitution also stated: &quot;If any state law is inconsistent with a federal law, the federal law shall prevail and the state law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.&quot;

During this period, a substantial number of Malaysian laws, including Federated Malay States Enactments and Malayan Union and Federation of Malaya Ordinances, were extended to Singapore. Some of these statutes continue to apply, often in modified form, in Singapore today.

Under the Malaysia Act 1963, the judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a Federal Court, a High Court in Malaya, a High Court in Borneo and a High Court in Singapore. This new structure was officialised with effect from 16 March 1964 through the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (M&#x27;sia), which replaced the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore with the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore. The jurisdiction of the High Court in Singapore was limited to all territory in the State of Singapore.

===1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully independent nation===
Merger with Malaysia did not last: within two years, on 9 August 1965, Singapore was expelled from the Federation and became a fully independent republic. This was effected by the signing of the Independence of Singapore Agreement of 7 August 1965 by Singapore and Malaysia, and the changes consequent to the Agreement were implemented by two Malaysian Acts, the Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 and the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1966; and by two Singapore Acts, the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965 and the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965. Section 5 of the latter Act provided that the legislative powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the supreme ruler of Malaysia, ceased to extend to Singapore, and vested instead in the Head of State (that is, the President of Singapore) and the Legislature of Singapore. Again, all laws were expressed to continue in force with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as might be necessary to bring them into conformity with the independent status of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia. Today, the Parliament of Singapore is an organ of state with plenary power to enact legislation for Singapore.

At the time of independence, the Singapore Parliament did not make any changes to the judicial system. Thus, for an anomalous four-year period, the High Court in Singapore remained part of the Malaysian court structure. This was remedied in 1969, when the Constitution was amended to establish the Supreme Court of Singapore replacing the Federal Court of Malaysia with respect to Singapore, while retaining the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as Singapore&#x27;s court of final appeal. The Supreme Court was divided into two divisions: the upper division consisted of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which respectively dealt with civil and criminal matters; the lower division being the High Court of Singapore.

In 1970 the subordinate courts were re-organised. Since that time, the Subordinate Courts of Singapore have consisted of the District Courts, the Magistrates&#x27; Courts, the Juvenile Courts and the Coroners&#x27; Courts. The Subordinate Courts were renamed the State Courts of Singapore on 7 March 2014.

Steps to restrict appeals to the Privy Council were first taken in 1989. In that year, the law was changed such that appeals to the Privy Council would only be permitted in a civil case if all the parties agreed to such an appeal prior to the hearing of the case by the Court of Appeal. In criminal cases, an appeal to the Privy Council could only be taken if the death penalty was involved and if the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were not unanimous in their decision. These changes came shortly after the Privy Council restored a prominent opposition Member of Parliament, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore after he had been struck off for a criminal conviction for making false statements in a statutory declaration; the court described the conviction as &quot;a grievous injustice&quot;. In 1993, the previous set-up of a separate Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal was done away with, and in their place a unified Court of Appeal was constituted for both civil and criminal appeals. Judges of Appeal appointed to the Court of Appeal were no longer required to engage in High Court work. The Chief Justice sat as the President of the Court of Appeal. The establishment of the permanent Court of Appeal paved the way for the abolition of all appeals to the Privy Council with effect from 8 April 1994. Following this, the Court of Appeal issued a Practice Statement dated 11 July 1994, stating that while the Court would treat its own prior decisions and those of the Privy Council as normally binding, where it appeared that adherence to such decisions &quot;would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore&quot; it would regard itself as free to depart from such decisions. It added that this power would be exercised sparingly, bearing in mind the danger of retrospectively disturbing contractual, proprietary and other legal rights. Today, the Court of Appeal of Singapore is the highest court in the land.

The independent status of Singapore&#x27;s legal system was underlined by the repeal of section 5 of the Civil Law Act (see above) on 12 November 1993 by the Application of English Law Act 1993. The Act aims to clarify the extent of the application of English law in Singapore. It states that the common law of England (including the principles and rules of equity), so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before the commencement of the Act, continues to be part of Singapore law so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require. As for English statutes, only those that are listed in the Schedules to the Act apply or continue to apply in Singapore; no other English enactment is part of Singapore law.

==Sources of law==


Generally, Singapore has three sources of law: legislation, judicial precedents (case law), and custom.

===Legislation===
Legislation, or statutory law, can be divided into statutes and subsidiary legislation. Statutes are written laws enacted by the Singapore Parliament, as well as by other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed. One particularly important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which is the supreme law of Singapore – any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of the Constitution which is inconsistent with it is, to the extent of the inconsistency, void. Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993 (see above), are published in looseleaf form in a series called the &quot;Statutes of the Republic of Singapore&quot; which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from Singapore Statutes Online , a free service provided by the Attorney-General&#x27;s Chambers of Singapore.

Subsidiary legislation, also known as &quot;delegated legislation&quot; or &quot;subordinate legislation&quot;, is written law made by ministers or other administrative agencies such as government departments and statutory boards under the authority of a statute (often called its &quot;parent Act&quot;) or other lawful authority, and not directly by Parliament. Subsidiary legislation currently in force in Singapore is published in looseleaf form in a series called the &quot;Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore&quot; which is gathered in black binders. New subsidiary legislation published in the &quot;Gazette&quot; may be viewed for free online for five days on the Electronic Gazette website.

===Judicial precedent===
As Singapore is a common law jurisdiction, judgements handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgements may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity which have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. Since 1992, judgements of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore have appeared in the &quot;Singapore Law Reports&quot; (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore&#x27;s full independence in 1965 in special volumes of the SLR, and is currently working on a reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported judgements of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called LawNet, which is also managed by the Academy. Outside Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, they are available online from another fee-based service called Justis.

===Custom===
A custom is an established practice or course of behaviour that persons who engaged in it consider law. Customs do not have the force of law unless recognised in a case. &quot;Legal&quot; or &quot;trade&quot; customs are not recognised as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal. In Singapore, custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have judicial recognition.

== Civil Law ==
Since independence, the civil law of Singapore has developed distinctly from the English common law. Nonetheless, much of the Singaporean law is based upon the English law, and although English decisions made before 1827 are not considered binding, they are still persuasive in the judgments of the Singaporean court.

=== Contract ===
The law of contract deals with the rules of contract and dispute resolution pertaining to breaches of contract. 

With regard to remedies in contract, the Singapore court has affirmed the English case of &quot;Hadley v Baxendale&quot; — which establishes two limbs that allow for the establishment of remoteness in cases of breach: natural losses arising from breach, and special knowledge of a plaintiff — in the case of &quot;MXM Restaurants v Fish &amp; Co&quot;. In doing so, the court rejected Lord Hoffman&#x27;s requirement of assumption of liability in the English case of &quot;Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc&quot;.

=== Tort ===
Tort law is the branch of law that concerns private wrongs, including negligence, malpractice, and intentional tort. 

Whilst the current English paradigm for establishing a duty of care in cases of negligence was established in Caparo v Dickman, which formulated a three-stage test for determining duty of care, the Singaporean Court of Appeal has rejected the Caparo test in favour of their own test in Spandeck v DSTA.

Determining medical malpractice and standards of care have also differed from the English common law. 

==Criminal law==


Unlike the common criminal law of England, the criminal law of Singapore is largely statutory in nature, owing largely from the importation of the Indian penal code into Singapore law. The general principles of criminal law, as well as the elements and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide, theft and cheating, are set out in the Penal Code. Other important offences are created by statutes such as the Arms Offences Act, Kidnapping Act, Misuse of Drugs Act and Vandalism Act.

In addition, Singapore society is highly regulated through the criminalisation of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use, littering, jaywalking, the possession of pornography, the sale of chewing gum, and, prior to December 2022, sexual activity such as oral and anal sex between men. Nonetheless, Singapore is one of the countries with the least crime in the world, with a low incidence of violent crimes.

Singapore retains both corporal punishment (in the form of caning) and capital punishment (by hanging) as punishments for serious offences. For some offences, most notably trafficking in drugs above a certain specified quantity, the imposition of these penalties is mandatory.

<text>The Rush River, in the U.S. state of Minnesota, is a waterway located entirely in Sibley County, although its watershed also includes parts of Nicollet and McLeod counties. It is a tributary of the Minnesota River.

The Rush River begins at the junction of its Middle and North Branches, at approximately 94.1W longitude, and 44.5N latitude. It then flows generally to the east, with the South Branch joining it at approximately 94.0W and 44.5N. It continues east until it joins the Minnesota River north-northeast of Le Sueur, Minnesota, which then proceeds generally north and east until it joins the Mississippi River.

==North Branch Rush River==
The North Branch Rush River drains from Titlow Lake east of Gaylord, Minnesota, and flows southeast, joining the Middle Branch Rush River to form the Rush River.

==Middle Branch Rush River==
The Middle Branch Rush River starts northwest of Gibbon, Minnesota and flows east until it joins the North Branch and forms the Rush River.

==South Branch Rush River==
The South Branch Rush River starts between Winthrop and Lafayette, west-southwest of Gaylord near the Sibley-Nicollet county line, and flows east until it joins the Rush River.

<text>Lethbridge-West is an Alberta provincial electoral district, covering the western half of the city of Lethbridge, including all of West Lethbridge.

Under the Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution of 2004, 13 Street forms most of the dividing line between Lethbridge-East and Lethbridge West. Scenic Drive and 16 Avenue South form a small part of the boundary. Clockwise from Lethbridge-East, the constituency is bounded at the city limits by Little Bow, by Livingstone-Macleod and then again by Little Bow.

The Member of the Legislative Assembly for this district is New Democrat Rob Miyashiro.

==History==
The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution from the old electoral district of Lethbridge when it was split in half. It also took in territory from the riding of Macleod from west of the Oldman River. 

The 2010 boundary redistribution made some minor revisions to equalize the population between West and East. North of St. Edward Blvd the boundary was pushed west from 13 Street to Stafford Drive.

===Boundary history===


===Representation history===

The electoral district was created in 1971 from the old Lethbridge district when it was split in half. Prior to 1971 the city returned candidates from a number of different banners. The first representative returned in the election held that year was Social Credit candidate Richard Gruenwald who won the district with well over half of the popular vote.

Gruenwald would run for a second term in the 1975 election and would be defeated finishing a distant second place behind Progressive Conservative candidate John Gogo who took almost 60% of the popular vote. Gogo would win his next two terms in 1979 and 1982 with increasing majorities achieving almost 70% of the popular vote.

Gogo would lose significant popularity upon re-election to his fourth term in 1986. He would fall from 70% the previous election to under half. He would hold his seat for a final term in 1989 when he took just over 45% of the popular vote. In his last term in office Premier Don Getty appointed Gogo as Minister of Advanced education He held that until 1992. Gogo retired from dissolution of the Assembly in 1993.

The 1993 election saw a hotly contested race between Progressive Conservative candidate Clint Dunford and Liberal candidate Michael Dietrich. Dunford won by a razor thin margin of just over 100 votes to hold the seat for his party and taking just over 41% of the popular vote.

Dunford was re-elected in 1997 winning a slightly higher plurality. After the election he was appointed to the provincial cabinet by Premier Ralph Klein as Minister of Advanced Education and Career Development. In 1999 he was shuffled to the Minister of Human Resources and Employment portfolio.

Dunford ran for his third term in 2001 increasing his plurality slightly taking 48% of the popular vote and kept his cabinet post. He ran for his fourth term in office in 2004 and fell to an all-time low holding his seat with just 39% of the popular vote. After that election he was shuffled to the Minister of Economic Development until 2006. Dunford retired from the legislature in 2008.

The fourth representative returned from the riding was Progressive Conservative candidate Greg Weadick who won his first term as MLA in 2008, and was re-elected in 2012, but was defeated in the 2015 general election by Shannon Phillips of the NDP. In 2019, Phillips held onto the riding with a reduced margin of victory over the second-place finishing UCP candidate with just 45% of the popular vote.

On November 19, 2004, a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="1165917" wikidata="Q1083407" url="?curid=1165917" title="Uncle Anesthesia">
<text>Uncle Anesthesia is the fifth studio album by the American band Screaming Trees. It was released in 1991 via Epic Records. It includes three of the four tracks from the band&#x27;s previous Epic release, &quot;Something About Today&quot;. 

&quot;Bed of Roses&quot; was released as a single and peaked at No. 23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band supported the album with a North American tour that included shows with Nirvana and Das Damen; Dan Peters played drums on much of the tour.

==Production==
Recorded at London Bridge Studio, &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; was produced primarily by Terry Date and Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell. Unlike in the past, the band rehearsed for a couple of weeks before recording. The album took six and a half weeks to record.

&quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; was the last to feature drumming by original member Mark Pickerel, who left on amicable terms in 1991. He was replaced by Barrett Martin.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; noted the &quot;strong rockin&#x27; guitars with psychedelic undercurrents and the occasional pause for the pensive cause.&quot; The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; wrote that &quot;vocalist Mark Lanegan croons fairy tale lyrics that melt through a sonic wall of guitars and percussion.&quot; The &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; concluded that &quot;if Jim Morrison had joined a garage band instead of the jazz-trained Doors, it might have sounding something like Screaming Trees.&quot;

&quot;The Province&quot; opined that &quot;Gary Lee Conner resurrects the guitar sound of Syd Barrett and takes the band toward Interstellar Overdrive.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; determined that &quot;Gary Lee Conner can tear off a screeching lead or stomp a wah-wah pedal like any halfway-initiated Black Sabbath disciple, but he&#x27;s not merely a piledriver; his atmospheric playing on tracks like &#x27;Bed of Roses&#x27; give them unexpected delicacy.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; stated that &quot;Lanegan&#x27;s spooky, back-from-the-crypt vocals and Gary Lee Conner&#x27;s luminous guitars give this album an otherworldly glow.&quot;

<doc id="1165929" wikidata="Q3080673" url="?curid=1165929" title="Stanwell">
<text>Stanwell is a village in the Spelthorne district, in Surrey, England. It is west of central London. A small corner of its land is used as industrial land for nearby Heathrow Airport. The rest of the village is made up of residential and recreational land. Historically part of the county of Middlesex, it has, like the rest of Spelthorne, been in Surrey since 1965. The village is to the south of the cargo-handling area of Heathrow Airport and to the east of the Staines Reservoirs. Stanwell is the northernmost settlement in Surrey,
bordering Berkshire and Greater London.

Its recognisable extent has been substantially cut three times – all in the 20th century. Land was taken for reservoirs in about 1900; a few decades later land was taken into Heathrow Airport; and in 1995, after the completion of the M25 motorway, the settlement of Poyle (beyond Stanwell Moor) was detached from the Borough and reassigned to Colnbrook in the Borough of Slough.

Stanwell Moor is near the village and has multiple reservoirs around it. It was recognised as a manor in medieval times. It has a few pasture/horse-riding fields, horticultural businesses and flood meadows. It is centred from the historical nucleus of Stanwell and is part of the same ward and ecclesiastical parish.

==History==

There are two theories regarding the origin of the name &quot;Stanwell&quot;. One is that it was named after St Ann(e)&#x27;s well in the village, but according to all known records the parish church has always been dedicated to St Mary. The second is that it means &#x27;stone well&#x27;, referring to stony soil or the adjoining street to the south. The first few letters of the name are the same as in the name of neighbouring Staines-upon-Thames, which also is said to mean &#x27;stones&#x27;, in the same way as the Great Vowel Shift failed to influence the spelling and pronunciation of the contemporaneously pronounced Stane Streets (i.e. stone streets), the Old English for many of the stone-laid Roman roads in Britain

The Domesday Book of 1086 records &#x27;Stanwelle&#x27; held by Walter, son of Othere. This places it among the large minority of head manors retained by men with Anglo-Saxon names. Its Domesday assets were: 15 hide, 4 mills worth £3 10s 0d and 375 eels, 3 weirs worth 1000 eels, 10 ploughs, meadow for 12 ploughs and woodland worth 12 hogs. It rendered £14 per year to its feudal system overlords. The fruitful watercourse was the western border of the village and of Middlesex, the River Colne West Bedfont may have been a hamlet of Stanwell in 1086; however, the dividing line between West Bedfont hamlet in Stanwell parish and East Bedfont in the parish of Bedfont (now in Greater London) may not have been drawn before the 11th or 12th century. West Bedfont along with Rudsworth are no longer used by residents (as localities, hamlets, neighbourhoods). In the Middle Ages the parish was mostly open fields
In 1603, Thomas Knyvet was granted the manor of Stanwell. Knyvet was the man who arrested Guy Fawkes in his attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. He was created Lord Knyvet in 1607, and in his will left money to found a free school in Stanwell, which was established in 1624. The building is no longer a school and now belongs to a housing association. It is Grade II* listed. However Thomas Knyvett College, bears his name in the twenty-first century.

James VI and I&#x27;s infant daughter Mary died at Stanwell while in the care of the Knyvet household. Several members of the aristocracy lived there in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin was first grown c. 1830 by Richard Cox in his garden on the Bath Road within the parish, see Colnbrook which now has this piece of land.

An unknown species of rose was found in a local garden in 1838, and given the name of Stanwell Perpetual.

Hounslow Heath extended over the area north of Bedfont Road until 1792, and a strip of moorland (Borough Green and Spout Moor) along the present Spout Lane joined it to Hither Moor and Farther Moor, which stretched towards Staines Moor. There were lammas lands in the far east and elsewhere and meadows along many of the river banks, particularly in the north, but the remainder of the parish was largely arable land. Nearly all the land west of Stanwell Moor&#x27;s clustered centre and that around Hammonds Farm was enclosed by the mid-18th century. Borough Field, to the north and west of the manor-house, and another small field nearby were inclosed in 1771 by the lord of the manor. Most of the area south of Stanwell and West Bedfont villages remained open until 1792 on their enclosure.

By the 18th century the remaining common land was generally known as Stanwell Field or Town Field until its enclosure. Orchards and market gardens began to spread over the parish in the second half of the 19th century. The Staines and West Drayton Railway (now closed) was opened in 1884, with Colnbrook railway station in Stanwell parish at Poyle, after the then neighbouring village. The streets of small houses behind the southwest Crooked Billet roundabout (named after a demolished pub) were built in the 1880s. As a community they formed part of Staines, and were transferred to it officially in 1896.

The Staines Union Workhouse was built on the London Road in the mid-19th century. Together with a former boys&#x27; home and a former isolation hospital, both opened about 1913, it became Ashford Hospital. Two cemeteries were opened near the A30 between 1895 and 1910. The Staines Reservoirs were completed in 1902 and started supplying water to London in 1904. Between them they cover .
The two old settlements grew slightly, notably by the building of council housing estates in Stanwell in 1919 and in Stanwell Moor in 1930. A private motor-bus served the village by 1926, and London Transport buses began in 1932. Poyle Halt on the defunct railway opened in 1927 and Poyle Industrial Estate Halt in 1953. Housing society and council house building began after the Second World War, including 300 pre-fabricated homes. From 1930, having formed part of a 19th-century Sanitary District then Rural District, Stanwell was administered by Staines Urban District (of the county of Middlesex) until its 1974 dissolution. In 1965 were it not for special provision Stanwell would have seceded with the rest of Middlesex to London: the Staines, Sunbury and Potters Bar Urban Districts transferred variously to Surrey and Hertfordshire, the most distant parts of the county from London.

The civil parish, with its wider functions than those surviving today. It was relatively active; it intervened with partial success in the negotiations for the building of the reservoirs and saw the provision of allotments in 1918 and of a recreation ground in 1927. Its first complaint about dangerous driving along the London Road was made in 1909. In addition to the overseer, who was unpaid, the council had two salaried assistant overseers, one of whom was also clerk to the council and the other of whom was the rate collector. The council protested against the inclusion of Stanwell in Staines Urban District, which nevertheless took place, so that the council was dissolved. In 1951 the parish had a population of 8148. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

===On Heathrow&#x27;s construction===
In the northwest of the parish, off Spout Lane, Middlesex County Council established 24 small holdings in the early 1930s: Burrows Hill Close estate and Bedfont Court. The part of Stanwell New Road north of Park Road opened as a main north–south route in 1948. The following year, most of the former Hounslow Heath land to the north-east, predominantly in Harmondsworth, became London Airport. The east end of the local road to Bedfont was diverted, and the roads running north were turned over, together with the eastern half of Spout Lane, where houses were demolished.

In 2004, the village of Stanwell won a bronze medal in the national Britain in Bloom competition, in the urban community category.

==Notable buildings==
===Parish church===

The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is a Norman building with a 14th-century Gothic chancel and 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic west tower. The tower has a spire with wood shingles. Inside the church are monuments to members of the Knyvet(t) family who bought Staines manor after their foiling of the planting of the gunpowder and Fawkes.

The church was restored in 1862 under the direction of Samuel Sanders Teulon, and restored again in 1903. The building is Grade I listed.

===Stanwell Place===
Stanwell Place was a grand manor house from the 17th century west of the village church, north of Park Road. The Gibbons family owned the manorial rights from 1754 to 1933, and slowly sold off the estate from the 1800s. Sold to John Watson Gibson in 1933, four years later were sold off to the Metropolitan Water Board for the development of the King George VI Reservoir, now in Staines. After Gibson&#x27;s death in 1947, Stanwell Place was sold to King Faisal II of Iraq who owned it until his assassination in 1958. The estate was then purchased for gravel extraction, and despite local attempts to prevent it, the house was allowed to become derelict, and demolished in the 1960s.

==Economy==

What was the north of the parish is a major industrial, distribution and headquarters zone, bound up now in the broad expression &#x27;the M4 corridor&#x27;. There was little building in the parish before World War I. The first factory/warehouse at Poyle appeared before 1914 another at West Bedfont in the 1920s. By 1956 there were between 70 and 80 at Poyle, and several at West Bedfont. During the 1920s and 1930s ribbon development spread along the main roads: on the A4 Bath Road Colnbrook remains mainly residential. Garages and a few small factories (now motor manufacturer garages and offices) had been built by the 1950s and remain along the A30 London Road, including Del Monte, Ford and Suzuki.

At one time British Mediterranean Airways was headquartered at the Cirrus House within the post town but in the London Borough of Hounslow, near Stanwell.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are Ashford (Surrey) railway station, south of Stanwell High Street, and Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station, east. Heathrow Terminal 4 is also served by the Piccadilly line of London Underground.

Stanwell High Street itself is served by minimal public transport provision, of bus routes that run only once or twice a day. However, Clare Road to the east of Stanwell is served regularly (three buses an hour) by London Buses route 203 between Hounslow and Staines, as well as by route 442 half-hourly between Heathrow Terminal 5 and Staines operated by local bus company Carlone Ltd.

==Politics==
Stanwell has historically been one of the few wards of Surrey County Council held by the Labour Party.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<text>The Jersey Triad was a triumvirate stable active in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from mid-to-late 1999. The group consisted of Diamond Dallas Page, Chris Kanyon and Bam Bam Bigelow. Their name came from the members being billed from New Jersey (although Kanyon was actually from New York).

==History==

===Formation===
Shortly after Slamboree in May 1999, Diamond Dallas Page formed an alliance with fellow New Jerseyan Bam Bam Bigelow and began feuding with Perry Saturn and Raven for the WCW World Tag Team Championship.

On the May 31, 1999 episode of Nitro, Page and Bigelow sent Raven to the hospital after a severe beating, leaving Saturn alone to defend the Tag Team Titles, which Page and Bigelow won later that night with help from Chris Kanyon replacing Raven in the match however he cost the team the championships after Page pinned him.

Page, Bigelow, and Kanyon became known as the Jersey Triad after Kanyon officially joined them on the June 7, 1999 episode of Nitro, when he turned on Saturn after Chris Benoit and Saturn defeated Page and Bigelow for the titles.

The Triad regained the belts six days later at The Great American Bash on June 13, 1999, after Kanyon pinned Benoit.

===&quot;Freebird Rule&quot;===
Due to an affiliation with then &quot;WCW President for Life&quot; Ric Flair, the Triad was permitted to defend these titles in any way possible using the Freebird Rule- any two of the three wrestlers could defend the tag team titles at any time. This even saw the Triad switching members during a title defense, the rule being one member had to be on the floor at all times.

On July 11, 1999, at Bash at the Beach, the Jersey Triad defeated Benoit and Saturn again to retain their Tag Team Titles.

The team held the titles until Road Wild where Kanyon and Bigelow would lose them to Harlem Heat on August 14, 1999. In the same night Chris Benoit defeated Diamond Dallas Page to retain his WCW United States Championship, despite interference from Kanyon and Bigelow

===Break up and aftermath===
The group broke up shortly after Fall Brawl in September 1999, after Goldberg pinned Page. Diamond Dallas Page continued feuding with Hogan again, joining Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner in a team effort to take on Hogan, Sting, and Goldberg. Soon after that feud ended Page turned into a hero again and feuded with both Kanyon and Bigelow before the year ended. Both Page and Bigelow feuded with Kanyon during his Chris &quot;Champagne&quot; Kanyon gimmick.

Page and Kanyon would reunite as a tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during the WCW Invasion storyline, as they were both members of the Alliance in 2001. The pair held the WWF Tag Team Championship once.

<doc id="1165935" wikidata="Q7630597" url="?curid=1165935" title="Sub-Rosa Subway">
<text>&quot;Sub-Rosa Subway&quot; is a song written by the Canadian rock band Klaatu, from their album &quot;3:47 EST&quot;, describing the efforts of Alfred Ely Beach to create the Beach Pneumatic Transit, the New York City Subway&#x27;s precursor. His work is described as secretive (hence &quot;sub rosa&quot;). The song peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977.

Two minutes and fifty seconds into the song, a long message in Morse code plays in the background. John Woloschuk, in an article in the fan magazine &quot;The Morning Sun&quot;, finally provided a translation of the code:

&quot;From Alfred, heed thy sharpened ear — A message we do bring — Starship appears upon our sphere — Through London&#x27;s sky come spring.&quot; 

The harpsichord sound on the song was created by recording a tack piano with the tape recorder running at half-normal speed.

<text>&quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; is the fifth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Jean Lisette Aroeste and directed by Ralph Senensky, it was first broadcast on October 18, 1968.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels with an alien ambassador whose appearance induces madness.

This episode was the second appearance of Diana Muldaur in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. She appeared previously as Dr. Ann Mulhall in the second season episode, &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot; and would later appear as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

A Medusan named Zero would later appear as a main character in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;. The name of the season 2 episode &quot;Is There in Beauty No Truth?,&quot; which focused on Zero, was a homage to this episode.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is assigned to escort Medusan ambassador Kollos and psychologist Dr. Miranda Jones to a rendezvous with a Medusan vessel. Medusans are non-humanoid creatures whose outward appearance is described as being so ugly as to cause humanoids who see them to go insane and then die. Kollos travels in a carrier to hide him from view, and First Officer Spock assists as necessary using a special visor which allows his Vulcan psychology to withstand the sight of Kollos. Jones is also able to observe Kollos with the help of the visor, a fact which she claims is due to Vulcan-style mental discipline.

At a dinner with Captain Kirk and the senior officers, Jones, a telepath, explains that her assignment is to attempt a mind link with Kollos in the hope of allowing Starfleet to utilize the Medusan&#x27;s unique senses and navigational abilities. In the course of the discussion, Jones breaks off, sensing someone nearby with murderous intentions. She then returns to her quarters, where she is visited by her associate Lawrence Marvick. Marvick is in love with Jones, a feeling which she does not reciprocate, and she senses that he is the would-be murderer. He then makes his way to Kollos&#x27;s quarters with a phaser, but is overcome by the sight of the Medusan before he can fire. Now insane, Marvick rushes to Engineering, overpowers and renders unconscious Chief Engineer Scott and other crew members, and takes control of the engines. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; quickly accelerates past Warp Factor 9.5, which takes it far outside of the galaxy and into a strange swirling void. Marvick, now restrained, screams wild accusations at Jones before he dies.

With no navigational references, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew cannot return home. Kirk suggests that Kollos&#x27;s superior navigational abilities could be of use, and Spock volunteers to mind meld with Kollos, allowing the two to pilot the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as one entity. Miranda Jones objects that she is a more logical choice, but McCoy reveals that she is blind and therefore couldn&#x27;t possibly pilot a starship. (Her jeweled wrap, it turns out, is actually an elaborate sensor web designed to compensate for her blindness).

A partition is set up on the bridge to hide Kollos, and Spock, wearing the visor, completes the mind link. Kollos and Spock, acting through Spock&#x27;s body, successfully return the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to known space, and then retire behind the partition to dissolve the link, but forgetting the visor. Kirk shouts a warning, but Spock, unable to look away in time, goes mad and attacks the crew. He is subdued by a phaser blast from Kirk and rushed to Sickbay, where his condition deteriorates. Jones attempts to make mental contact with Spock but is apparently unable to help, and Kirk suggests that she, in her jealousy, does not really wish to. Enraged by the accusation, she makes one more attempt, and succeeds in bringing Spock&#x27;s mind back to reality.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at its destination, and Kollos and Jones prepare to depart. Jones thanks Kirk for his insight, crediting it with ensuring her future. Kollos and Jones are now &quot;one&quot;, and she now knows the joy of the mind link for herself. Kirk gives Jones a rose as they leave, reminding her that every rose has thorns.

==Production and reception==
This was the final episode filmed in the series&#x27; production that featured Eddie Paskey as Lt. Leslie. As the episodes were however shown out of production order, the final episode to feature the character was &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot;.

The title is taken from a line in the poem &quot;Jordan&quot; by George Herbert. The Vulcan philosophy &quot;Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations&quot; first appeared in the episode. Show creator Gene Roddenberry inserted a speech by Kirk praising the philosophy and associated medal. The &quot;pointless&quot; speech was, according to William Shatner, a &quot;thinly-veiled commercial&quot; for replicas of the medal, which Roddenberry&#x27;s company Lincoln Enterprises soon sold to fans.

== Releases ==
This was released on LaserDisc in 1987 in the United States, paired with &quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot; on one double sided 12&quot; disc.

This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<text>Vermilion-Lloydminster was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using first past the post method of voting from 1993 to 2019.

The largest communities in the constituency are City of Lloydminster, Town of Vermilion and Town of Viking.

==History==
The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary re-distribution out of the old Lloydminster and Vermilion-Viking districts.

Under the Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution of 2004, the constituency was bounded by the Saskatchewan border to the east, and clockwise from there is bounded by Battle River-Wainwright, Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville, Lac La Biche-St. Paul and Bonnyville-Cold Lake. The district remained completely unchanged in the 2010 electoral boundary re-distribution.

The electoral district was abolished in the 2017 electoral boundary re-distribution, and redistributed into Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright and Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville electoral districts which would take effect for the 2019 Alberta general election.

===Boundary history===

===Electoral history===
The riding was created in 1993 and has been returning Progressive Conservative MLA&#x27;s with large majorities since it was created. The first member was Steve West who had previously served as MLA for Vermilion-Viking for two terms beginning in 1986. While representing this riding he served a number of cabinet portfolios in the government of Ralph Klein. West retired from office in 2001.

The second representative of the riding is Lloyd Snelgrove who was first elected in 2001 and has since served three terms in office. Snelgrove briefly served as Minister of Finance under the government of Ed Stelmach. He decided to leave the Progressive Conservative caucus on January 27, 2012 and sit is an Independent after becoming disenchanted with Premier Alison Redford.

Dr. Richard Starke won the riding for the Progressive Conservatives in the 2012 election, and was one of only two PC MLAs to win re-election outside of Calgary in the 2015 election. He placed second in the PC leadership election of 2017 on a campaign of remaining an independent party from Wildrose. When the PCs subsequently voted to join the Wildrose and form the United Conservative Party, he announced he would continue to sit as a PC rather than join the new party.

Starke retired at the end of the 29th Legislature. The district was abolished at the same time, and replaced with Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright.

On November 19, 2004 a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="1165943" wikidata="Q912276" url="?curid=1165943" title="Electric Music for the Mind and Body">
<text>Electric Music for the Mind and Body is Country Joe and the Fish&#x27;s debut album. Released in May 1967 on the Vanguard label, it was one of the first psychedelic albums to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Tracks from the LP, especially &quot;Section 43&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, and &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot;, were played on progressive FM rock stations like KSAN and KMPX in San Francisco, often back-to-back. A version of the song &quot;Love&quot; was performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.

==Background==

Country Joe and the Fish were originally formed in 1965 by Country Joe McDonald and Barry Melton as an acoustic folk/jugband duo. This embryonic version of the group, supplemented by Carl Shrager, Bill Steele and Mike Beardslee, recorded an initial EP in September of that year which was released as a &quot;talking issue&quot; of &quot;Rag Baby&quot; magazine a month later. The EP featured early versions of &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin-to-Die Rag&quot; and &quot;Superbird&quot;, both of which would be re-recorded for the first two albums, along with two Peter King tracks. By January 1966 the group had expanded into a semi-electric six-piece, with the transition to a fully electric rock band happening after several members attended a Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Jefferson Airplane show at UC Berkeley on April 16. On June 6, this version of the group cut a self-titled second EP at Berkeley&#x27;s Sierra Sound Laboratories released that July, featuring three songs (&quot;Section 43&quot;, &quot;Thing Called Love&quot;, and &quot;Bass Strings&quot;) which would all be re-recorded for the debut album. The EP was pressed four times and proved very popular, which resulted in record company attention; in early November of 1966 the group were set to record a third EP when they were discovered and signed to Vanguard records by producer Samuel Charters.

==Songs and Recording==

In late November 1966 the group began trial recordings for the album at Sierra Sound Laboratories, but clashes between Joe and drummer John Francis Gunning led to the latter&#x27;s abrupt firing. His replacement, Gary &quot;Chicken&quot; Hirsh, joined the group in time for an extended period of rehearsals at The Barn in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the weeks before Christmas 1966, where the new lineup gelled. 

Recording sessions for the album proper took place on four-track machines during the first week of February 1967 at Sierra Sound, produced by Charters. The instrumental backings to the songs were largely played live in the studio, with Joe&#x27;s later vocal overdubs recorded with the lights out due to his self-consciousness at having the others look at him while singing. 

The first songs recorded on February 1 were &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot;, chosen as the lead single that April, and &quot;Bass Strings&quot;, which had originally appeared on the second EP. According to Joe, the subject of &quot;Lorraine&quot; was a compendium of several different women although he professed to not particularly like the song, and wondered how it became popular. The group were nervous to sing &quot;Bass Strings&quot; as the lyrics admitted they all smoked marijuana, which was a felony at the time; at the end of the track Joe can be heard whispering the letters &quot;L-S-D&quot;. On February 2, &quot;Porpoise Mouth&quot; (known as &quot;Happiness Is A Porpoise Mouth&quot; on the stereo pressing) and &quot;The Masked Marauder&quot; were committed to tape; the former is about an erection and shifts time signatures from 3/4 to 6/8, while the latter is a multi-sectional instrumental which was the newest thing written for the album, developed during the December 1966 Barn rehearsals. The next day, &quot;Death Sound&quot; (known as &quot;Death Sound Blues&quot; on the stereo pressing), &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; were tackled. &quot;Death Sound&quot; was one of the earliest songs penned, an acid-blues number with dark themes of death. &quot;Love&quot; had been another early song written by the whole band and recorded for the self-titled second EP as &quot;Thing Called Love&quot;, although it appears here in a faster rearrangement with a soul backbeat and lead vocal by Melton. &quot;Grace&quot; was Joe&#x27;s ode to Grace Slick, the lead singer of Jefferson Airplane. Joe had met her while she was in her earlier band, The Great Society, and wanted to give her better material to sing. The song was influenced by Japanese music and employed a number of sonic additions including bells, chimes, water sound effects, and increasing echo delay, getting slower as it progresses. 

February 4 was given to re-takes and overdubs to &quot;Lorraine&quot;, &quot;Masked Marauder&quot;, &quot;Bass Strings&quot;, and &quot;Porpoise Mouth&quot;. On February 6 the group reconvened to cut the album opener &quot;Flying High&quot; and lengthy side one closer &quot;Section 43&quot;. &quot;Flying High&quot; was based on a real-life incident where Joe was stuck hitchhiking in the rain in Los Angeles, ignored by all the &quot;straight&quot; cars until finally picked up by two fellow hippies. &quot;Section 43&quot; was another track that had appeared on the second EP, originally begun by Joe on an acoustic guitar and harmonica with more sections added in as it developed, with influences ranging from guitarist John Fahey to classical pieces like &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;. The final recording was edited together from three sections titled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;ragtime&quot;, with Charters fading each one out to complete silence. The last day of recording, on the 7th, saw &quot;Superbird&quot; and &quot;Sad and Lonely Times&quot; completed. &quot;Superbird&quot; was a protest number taking aim at President Johnson that had initially appeared on the first EP from October 1965, transformed from an acoustic jugband number to a soul-infused rocker with added lyrics that promised the commander-in-chief would be made to &quot;eat flowers&quot; and &quot;drop acid&quot;. &quot;Sad And Lonely Times&quot; was an older song with Melton taking lead vocal, although members of the band have since identified it as their least favorite on the album due to its simple C&amp;W arrangement. 

Two other songs were considered for the album: &quot;Thought Dream&quot;, recorded on February 2, was held over for the sophomore effort &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die&quot;, while the &quot;I-Feel- Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die Rag&quot; itself (another song that had appeared on the first Rag Baby EP) was considered too controversial to record by Charters and held over until after it was seen how the similar protest number &quot;Superbird&quot; fared with radio.

When the sessions were finished, Charters took the tapes to Vanguard Studios in New York to edit and mix the album. He tried several different running orders but eventually settled on having each side begin with the more &quot;out&quot; or commercial songs and then gradually going further &quot;in&quot; to the most spiritual, psychedelic material.

==Release==

&quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot; previewed the album that April and was the band&#x27;s only entry on the singles chart, peaking at #95 on Billboard that August. The album was released on May 11, 1967, on the Vanguard label, with a release party thrown at the Fillmore on the same night. Sales were slow at first but picked up after the group&#x27;s appearance at the Monterey International Pop Festival that June (where versions of both &quot;Martha Lorraine&quot; and &quot;Section 43&quot; were filmed, the latter appearing in the movie), eventually peaking at #39 in September. 

Due to deterioration of the original master tapes, the album was remixed in 1982 and this remix was used for the original CD release in 1990. In 2013 a new two-disc deluxe version appeared which included both the original mono and stereo mixes. It is the first time producer Sam Charters’ original stereo mixdown had been issued on compact disc. Both stereo and mono versions of the album, with the mono housed in the original rejected sleeve design, were released on the &quot;Wave of Electrical Sound&quot; box set in 2018. 

==Reception==

The album was received warmly on release with the &quot;Berkeley Gazette&quot; in glowing praise, stating that songs like &quot;Bass Strings&quot; and &quot;Section 43&quot; &quot;employ echo chambers, distortion, and other electronic embellishments to augment the unique versatility of sound mixing the Fish compulsively indulge in...the mood is essentially psychedelic, with the texture of smoky colored glass.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder felt that the album is &quot;one of the most important and enduring documents of the psychedelic era&quot;. Country Joe later boasted &quot;If you want to understand psychedelic music, and you haven&#x27;t heard &quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot;, then you probably don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot; 

The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="1165946" wikidata="Q24039" url="?curid=1165946" title="Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham">
<text>Digby Marritt Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham, (born 28 October 1955) is a British businessman and politician who served as Director General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from 2000 to 2006, and Minister of State for Trade from 2007 to 2008. He sat in the House of Lords as a non-aligned active crossbencher until 2020.

==Career==
===Education and business career===
Jones was born on 28 October 1955 in Birmingham, England. He was educated at Bromsgrove School where he was Head Boy. From 1974 until 1977, Jones read law at University College London on a Royal Navy University Cadetship as a Sub-Lieutenant, graduating with upper second class honours. After graduation, Jones worked for 20 years at Edge &amp; Ellison, a firm of lawyers based in Birmingham, culminating in serving as Senior Partner from 1995 to 1998.

Jones was Chairman of the West Midlands Regional Council of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and became the first serving regional chairman to be appointed CBI&#x27;s Director-General, serving from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2006. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2005 New Year Honours for services to Business. He then acted as an adviser to Barclays Capital, Ford Motor Company, Deloitte and JCB. In November 2006, Jones was appointed &quot;Business Adviser&quot; to the Duke of York, receiving £1,000 a month from the royal payroll for working one day a month. This position ended upon his appointment as a Minister in July 2007.

Jones was a non-executive director for the IT contractor iSOFT from 2000 until his resignation in July 2005, when he stayed on for one year as an adviser.

===Government appointments and peerage===
Jones served as the unpaid UK Skills Envoy from 2006 to 2007, before taking up the role of Minister of State for Trade 29 June 2007. The post was situated in both the newly created Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He was appointed as a minister in a move to create a government of all the talents. As he was not a parliamentarian at the time, Jones was made a life peer, and became a member of the House of Lords. It was suggested that he was taking the Labour whip in the House of Lords, but he chose not to join the Labour Party. He was gazetted as a peer on 10 July 2007 as Baron Jones of Birmingham, &quot;of Alvechurch and of Bromsgrove in the County of Worcestershire&quot;, and took his seat in the House of Lords that same day.

Jones had considered running for Mayor of London after being encouraged by a group of prominent businessmen. He was also approached by the Conservative Party about becoming its candidate, but rejected this idea.

In April 2008, Jones announced his intention to resign as Minister of State for Trade later in the year. He resigned in October 2008 and was appointed to be a UK Business Ambassador for Trade and Investment. In testimony to the Public Administration Committee he said that his time as a junior minister was &quot;one of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences&quot; anyone could have and that he had been amazed by how many civil servants he thought deserved the sack. He was, however, positive about the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform in the October 2008 reshuffle.

===Subsequent political career and retirement ===
Jones sat as a crossbencher until retiring from the House of Lords on 31 August 2020.

On 20 September 2013, Jones spoke at the UK Independence Party conference in London as a guest speaker, addressing the conference on business and economic matters.

On 29 September 2014, it was rumoured that Jones might defect to the Conservative Party after he introduced the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, before his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. He said that Osborne &quot;deserves a personal pat on the back&quot; for having &quot;stuck to your guns and did what was right for our country.&quot; In response to any rumour regarding a possible defection, Jones stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t do party politics&quot; and &quot;business is my constituency.&quot;

In March 2020, Jones moved permanently to Guernsey, serving as Chairman of the Guernsey Policy &amp; Economics Group.

==Political views==
===Trade unions===
In 2006, Jones said of trade unions: &quot;They are in danger of withering on the vine of irrelevance. They are backward looking and not on today&#x27;s agenda. The trade unions put their members first and not the country. Labour is always in thrall to the unions. People keep banging on about cash for peerages, but the unions have bunged money to the government for years.&quot;

===Brexit===
In July 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum, Jones argued that the process of exiting the European Union would have minimal impact on the economy and employment, stating: &quot;There&#x27;s not going to be any economic pain. If there are job losses, they will be very few.&quot; According to &quot;The New European&quot;, he later contradicted this statement, declaring in January 2019 that he had &quot;made it very clear in every speech I gave we would be economically worse off.&quot;

==Media==
Jones was the guest on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, broadcast on 21 May 2006. He won BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; with a 9-point margin finishing on 33 points on 5 January 2011. Jones nominated Winston Churchill on BBC Radio 4 Great Lives.

He presented the BBC Two programme &quot;The New Troubleshooter&quot; where he &quot;helps businesses realise their potential, ruffling feathers and bruising egos along the way as he gets stuck in and delivers his analysis and advice&quot;, taking over the mantle of John Harvey-Jones who presented the original series &quot;Troubleshooter&quot;.

In July 2014 he presented a programme on BBC Radio 4, &quot;The Business Covenant&quot;.

In 2020 presented a programme looking at how businesses are getting ready for Brexit on Times Radio.

===Books===
In 2011 Jones published his first book, &quot;Fixing Britain: The Business of Reshaping Our Nation&quot; (Wiley), which was shortlisted for the 2012 CMI Management Book of the Year.

In 2017 &quot;Fixing Business: Making Profitable Business Work for the Good of All&quot;, was published in April 2017, also with Wiley.

==Honors and interests==

Jones has honorary fellowships from Cardiff University, University College London and Cardiff Metropolitan University; and a number of honorary doctorates from various UK universities.

While an active peer, Jones registered his outside interests with the UK parliament. This consisted of a number of chairmanships, paid speaking engagements, shareholdings, and directorships, and positions as an advisor.

==Personal life==
Jones and his wife, Pat, live in Guernsey.

Jones is a supporter of Leicester Tigers (officially Leicester Football Club), Aston Villa FC and a member of the Reform Club. Jones is also Patron of the Triumph Owners&#x27; Motorcycle Club.

<doc id="1165947" wikidata="Q2369159" url="?curid=1165947" title="Agitators">
<text>The Agitators were a political movement as well as elected representatives of soldiers, including members of the New Model Army under Lord General Fairfax, during the English Civil War. They were also known as &quot;adjutators&quot;. Many of the ideas of the movement were later adopted by the Levellers.

==History==
&quot;Agitators&quot;, or &quot;adjutators&quot;, was the name given to representatives elected in 1647 by the different regiments of the English Parliamentary army. The word really means an agent, but it was confused with &quot;adjutant,&quot; often called &quot;agitant,&quot; a title familiar to the soldiers, and thus the form &quot;adjutator&quot; came into use.

Early in 1647 the Long Parliament wished either to disband many of the regiments or to send them to Ireland. The soldiers, whose pay was largely in arrears, refused to accept either alternative, and eight of the cavalry regiments elected agitators, called at first commissioners, who laid their grievances before the three generals, and whose letter was read in the House of Commons on the 30 April 1647. The other regiments followed the example of the cavalry (nicknamed Ironsides), and the agitators, who belonged to the lower ranks of the army, were supported by many of the officers, who showed their sympathy by signing the &quot;Declaration of the army&quot;.

Fairfax, Cromwell and other generals succeeded to some extent in pacifying the troops by promising the payment of arrears for eight weeks at once; but before the return of the generals to London parliament had again decided to disband the army, and soon afterwards fixed the 1 June as the date on which this process was to begin.

Again alarmed, the agitators decided to resist; a mutiny occurred in one regiment and the attempt at disbandment failed. Then followed the seizure of King Charles I by Cornet Joyce. The Agitators, with two officers from each regiment and the Generals formed a new body called the Army Council which after a meeting near Newmarket, Suffolk on Friday 4 June 1647 issued &quot;A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax&quot; to Parliament on 8 June making their concerns known, and also the constitution of the Army Council so that Parliament would understand that the discontent was army-wide and had the support of both officers and other ranks. This Engagement was read out to the army at a general meeting on 5 June.

A few weeks later, there was another meeting while the army was camped at Thriplow Heath near Royston, the soldiers refused the offers made by Parliament, and the agitators demanded a march towards London and the &quot;purging&quot; of the House of Commons, which did not happen. Subsequent events are part of the general history of England. Gradually the agitators ceased to exist, but many of their ideas were adopted by the Levellers, who may perhaps be regarded as their successors. Gardiner says of them, &quot;Little as it was intended at the time, nothing was more calculated than the existence of this elected body of agitators to give to the army that distinctive political and religious character which it ultimately bore&quot;.

<text>A commercial driver&#x27;s license (CDL) is a driver&#x27;s license required in the United States to operate large and heavy vehicles (including trucks, buses, and trailers) or a vehicle of any size that transports hazardous materials or more than 15 passengers (including the driver).

==United States==
In the United States, the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 established minimum requirements that must be met when a state issues a CDL. While recreational vehicles and farm vehicles are exempt from requiring a CDL, federal law allows states to require a CDL for these vehicles. However, such vehicles are federally exempt from having to obtain a CDL. The following types of CDL licenses are:

*Class A – Any combination of vehicles that has a gross combination weight rating or gross combination weight of 26,001 pounds (11,794 kilograms) or more inclusive of a towed unit(s) with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kilograms).
*Class B – Any single vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of 26,001 pounds (11,794 kilograms) or more, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight that does not exceed 10,000 pounds (4,536 kilograms).
*Class C – Any single vehicle, or combination of vehicles, that does not meet the definition of Class A or Class B, but is either designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver or is transporting material that has been designated as hazardous under 49 U.S.C. 5103 and is required to be placarded under subpart F of 49 CFR Part 172 or is transporting any quantity of a material listed as a select agent or toxin in 42 CFR Part 73.

===Age requirements===
The minimum age for a CDL is determined by state governments. All states, as well as the District of Columbia, have made 18 the minimum age for a CDL to be issued with the exception of Hawaii where the minimum age is 21.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requires drivers to be 21 years or over to drive a commercial vehicle in &quot;interstate commerce&quot; (to move goods across state lines) and transport hazardous materials when placards are required. The FMCSA allows states to issue a CDL to drivers under 21 providing they only drive a commercial vehicle within the state where the CDL was issued, i.e. &quot;intrastate commerce&quot;. Additional age restrictions vary by state law. For example, New Jersey requires drivers to be at least 21 years of age for a passenger endorsement. 

On 15 November 2021, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation to lower the minimum age for a CDL Class A from 21 to 18. Previously, New York State only allowed 18 to 20-year-olds to apply for a CDL Class B or C, but not for a CDL Class A until they turn 21. 

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on 15 November 2021 by President Joe Biden established the &quot;safe driver apprenticeship pilot program&quot; that would allow qualified 18 to 20-year-olds with a CDL to operate in interstate commerce after successful completion of supervised training with an older and experienced driver. This program aims to help alleviate the national truck driver shortage by removing the barrier for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds to become professional bus and truck drivers by exempting them from the age requirement for interstate commerce provided they meet all other requirements as drivers age 21 and over.

===Regulation changes===
Before 1992, driving commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), which are primarily tractor-trailers (or Longer Combination Vehicles (LCVs)), required advanced skills and knowledge above and beyond those required to drive a car or other lightweight vehicle. Before the implementation of the commercial driver&#x27;s license (CDL) in 1992, licensing requirements for driving larger vehicles and buses varied from state to state.

This lack of training resulted in a large number of preventable traffic deaths and accidents.

In 1992, when the Act became law, all drivers were required to have a CDL in order to drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed testing standards for licensing drivers. U.S. states are able to issue CDLs only after a written and practical test have been given by the State or approved testing facility. A driver needs a CDL if the vehicle meets one of the definitions of a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) listed above.

A state may also require a driver to have a CDL to operate certain other vehicles. For example, a driver licensed in New Jersey must have a CDL to drive a bus, limousine, or van that is used for hire and designed to transport 8 to 15 passengers. A driver licensed in New York must have a CDL to legally transport passengers in school buses and other vehicles listed in Article 19-A of the state&#x27;s Vehicle and Traffic Law. Drivers licensed in California must have a CDL if their primary employment is driving, whether or not they actually drive a commercial vehicle. California defines a commercial vehicle as one that transports for hire either people or products. In addition, possession of a CDL in California changes the threshold for a Driving Under the Influence citation from 0.08% to 0.04% blood alcohol content.

Prospective licensees should verify CDL requirements by referencing their state specific CDL Manual.

In most states, a driver&#x27;s license (for cars) is required before a Commercial Driver&#x27;s License can be issued.

===Endorsements===
The following endorsements listed are federal-level endorsements. States are free to enact endorsements at the state level. For example, in New York State, a W endorsement is required to operate a tow truck.

===Endorsements without codes===
These are optional endorsements that do not carry an endorsement code, but may be required for certain CDL holders:

===Restrictions===
M, X, E, K, L, V, N, O, and Z are federal restrictions. Any other restrictions have been promulgated at the state level.

=== Training ===
Educational prerequisites vary by state. Some states, such as Ohio, for example require 160 hours of classroom and on the road training. Training may be obtained by completing a qualified CDL training program through a DMV-approved truck driving school. These training programs specialize in teaching potential truck drivers the necessary skills and knowledge to properly and safely operate a truck, including map reading, trip planning, and compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation laws, as well as backing, turning, hooking a trailer, and road driving. The overall purpose of these training schools is to help truckers-to-be pass the CDL knowledge and skills tests as well as advanced driving techniques such as skid avoidance and recovery and other emergency actions for situations such as a breakaway trailer and hydroplaning. These classes usually go well beyond the training the typical non-commercial driver receives, such as the driver&#x27;s education provided in high school. There are a number of licensed CDL training schools around the United States and many trucking companies operate their own schools as well. 

===Testing===
Although each state may add additional restrictions, there are national requirements which are as follows. A prospective driver must pass a series of written exams for a learner permit, or to add endorsements. The General Knowledge Test, required for a commercial learner permit, consists of 50 questions, where 80 percent of questions must be answered correctly to pass.

The CDL Skills Test must be passed for the applicant to obtain their CDL license. It includes three different sections:
#The first is the Pre-Trip Inspection where the applicant must inspect their vehicle and describe what they would inspect and why.
#The second is a written test on highway safety and a test about different parts of a truck with a minimum of 30 questions on the test. To pass this knowledge test, student drivers must answer at least 80 percent of the questions correctly.
#The third is a driving skills test. To pass the driving skills test, the student driver must successfully perform a set of required driving maneuvers. The driving skill test must be taken in a vehicle that the driver operates or expects to operate. For certain endorsements, such as air (pneumatic) brakes, the driving skills test must be taken in a vehicle equipped with such equipment. If the test is done in a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, a restriction of E will be placed on the license prohibiting the driver from operating a vehicle with a manual transmission. The student driver also needs to show they do in fact show the characteristics of an aware and fully operative driver. This does not exclude certain disabilities; however, standard requirements required by the safety operators must be met.

Employers, training facilities, states, governmental departments, and private institutions may be permitted to administer knowledge and driving test for the state. The test must be the same as those given by the state issuing the CDL, and the instructors must meet the same professional certification as state instructors.

States are required to conduct an inspection of any testing facility and evaluates the programs by taking an actual test as if they were testing driver at least once a year, or by taking a sample of drivers tested by the third party and then comparing pass/fail rates.

In addition, the state&#x27;s agreement with the third party testing centers must allow the FMCSA and the State to conduct random examinations, inspections, and audits without notice.

===Medical certification===
In 2014, the law regarding drivers in pursuit of a CDL was modified and now requires a DOT medical examiner to authorize a person with a medical issue to be able to drive. Prior to the change, a private doctor was able to authorize a driver to obtain a CDL. Most CMV drivers must prove they are healthy enough to safely drive a truck. A valid medical certificate must be filled out by a medical professional listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners at the conclusion of an extensive physical exam, with a copy provided to the state Bureau (or Department) of Motor Vehicles compliance unit. Some examples of an impairment which disqualifies a driver include the inability to grasp a steering wheel or operate foot pedals, insulin use, certain cardiac and respiratory problems, markedly elevated blood pressure, epilepsy, some severe psychiatric disorders, certain color blindness, poor corrected vision in either eye (worse than 20/40), bilateral hearing loss, active alcoholism, and other conditions which significantly increase the risk of a medical emergency behind the wheel. See Physical qualifications for drivers page of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

Not all medical providers are able to test and complete the medical certification form.

===Contents===
===CDLIS Clearinghouse===
The Commercial Driver&#x27;s License Information System (CDLIS) and the National Driver Register (NDR) exchange information on traffic convictions and driver disqualifications of commercial drivers. States have to use both CDLIS and NDR to check a driver&#x27;s record before a CDL can be issued. Trucking companies can use a commercial service that has clearance for providing this information as a means of screening prospective employees.

===Convictions===
*Driving without a CDL, or suspended CDL, incurs a civil penalty of up to $2,500 or, in aggravated cases, criminal penalties of up to $5,000 in fines and/or up to 90 days in prison.
*A conviction for driving while using an electronic device incurs a $2750 fine for the driver and a $11,000 fine for the employer.
*An employer is also subject to a penalty of up to $10,000 if they knowingly permit a driver to operate a CMV without a valid CDL.
*Two or more serious traffic violations, including excessive speeding, reckless driving, improper or erratic lane changes, following the vehicle ahead too closely, and traffic offenses in connection with fatal traffic accidents, within a three-year period: a 90-day to five-year suspension.
*One or more violations of a Motor vehicle declared out of service order within a 10-year period: one-year suspension.
*Driving under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol, or leaving the scene of an accident, or using a CMV to commit a felony: three-year suspension.
*Any of the one-year offenses while operating a CMV for hazardous materials or second offense of any of the one-year or three-year offenses, or using a CMV to commit a felony involving manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances: life suspension.

States can reduce certain lifetime disqualifications to a minimum disqualification period of 10 years if the driver completes a driver rehabilitation program approved by the State. Not all states do this: it is available in Idaho and New York State but not California or New Jersey.

If a CDL holder is disqualified from operating a CMV they cannot be issued a &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;hardship&quot; CDL, but can continue to drive non-commercial vehicles.

Any convictions are reported to the driver&#x27;s home State and Federal Highway Administration and these convictions are treated the same as convictions for violations that are committed in the home State.

The Commercial Drivers License Program collects and stores all convictions a driver receives and transmits this data to the home State so that any disqualification or suspension can be applied.

The FHWA has established 0.04% as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol and subject to lose his/her CDL. Additionally, an operator of a CMV that is found to have &#x27;any detectable amount of BAC above 0.0%&#x27; will be put out of service for a minimum of 24 hours.

A driver must report any driving conviction within 30 days, except parking, to their employer regardless of the nature of the violation.

Employers must be notified if a driver&#x27;s license is suspended, revoked, or canceled. The notification must be made by the end of the next business day following receipt of the notice of the suspension, revocation, cancellation, lost privilege or disqualification.

Employers cannot under any circumstances use a driver who has more than one license or whose license is suspended, revoked or canceled, or is disqualified from driving. Violation of this requirement may result in civil or criminal penalties.

===Occupational outlook===
The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% employment growth rate in Heavy and Tractor-trailer Trucking from 2019 to 2029, slower than the average growth rate of 4% across all professions. Scholarships are being awarded to military veterans at CDL-A schools and truck driving companies.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom the PCV Licence (PCV stands for Passenger Carrying Vehicle) enables the holder to drive buses and/or minibuses, subject to what kind of Practical Driving Test the licence holder passes.
*Category C+E Vehicles over with a trailer over , also known as Large Goods Vehicle, normal max gross weight : minimum age 21. 17 if in the Armed Forces and now 18 if the driver meets certain requirements regarding CPC (Certificate of Professional Competence).
*Category D1 allows the holder to drive a vehicle with between nine and sixteen passenger seats with a trailer up to maximum authorised mass.
*Category D1+E allows the holder to drive a vehicle with between nine and sixteen passenger seats with a trailer over maximum authorised mass, provided that the maximum authorised mass of the trailer does not exceed the unladen mass of the vehicle being driven and the combined maximum authorised mass of both the vehicle and trailer does not exceed .
**For example, a vehicle with an unladen mass of and a MAM of , with a trailer MAM of will give a combined MAM of – and the unladen mass of the vehicle being driven () is greater than the MAM of the trailer () so is acceptable. However, a vehicle with an unladen mass of and a MAM of , with a trailer MAM of will give a combined MAM of – but because the MAM of the trailer () exceeds the unladen weight of the vehicle being driven (), a Category D+E licence is needed to drive that vehicle.
*Category D allows the holder to drive a vehicle with more than eight passenger seats with a trailer up to maximum authorised mass.
*Category D+E allows the holder to drive a vehicle with more than eight passenger seats with a trailer over maximum authorised mass.

== India ==
In India, commercial drivers must obtain a Commercial Driving License (CDL) issued by the Regional Transport Office (RTO). The process generally includes:

# Eligibility: Applicants must be at least 18 years old and hold a valid non-commercial driving license for a minimum period, usually a year.
# Medical Fitness: Applicants must undergo a medical fitness examination to ensure they meet health standards necessary for commercial driving.
# Knowledge Test: A written test covering traffic rules, road signs, and vehicle operation must be passed.
# Skills Test: A practical driving test evaluates the applicant&#x27;s ability to operate a commercial vehicle safely under various road and traffic conditions.
# Endorsements: Additional endorsements may be required for specific vehicle types or hazardous materials transport.
# Application and Issuance: Successful applicants receive a CDL issued by the RTO, specifying the types of vehicles they are authorised to drive and any endorsements held.

Regulatory Framework

Countries regulate commercial driving licenses to ensure safety, efficiency, and compliance with national and international transport standards. Licensing requirements may include age restrictions, medical examinations, knowledge and skills testing, and ongoing professional development to enhance driver competence and road safety.

==Australia==
All places in Australia have a mostly similar driver licence system, although some things can change in each state or territory (e.g. what classes of license are available).

===Australian license classes===

*C Car: A &#x27;Class C&#x27; licence covers vehicles up to gross vehicle mass (GVM)
GVM is the maximum recommended weight a vehicle can be when loaded. A &#x27;Class C&#x27; Licence allows the holder to drive cars, utilities, vans, some light trucks, car-based motor tricycles, tractors and implements such as graders. You can also drive vehicles that seat up to 12 adults, including the driver.

*R Rider: Motorcycle riders require a &#x27;Class R&#x27; licence.
*LR Light Rigid: &#x27;Class LR&#x27; covers a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than but not more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM. This class also includes vehicles with a GVM up to which carry more than 12 adults including the driver and vehicles in class &#x27;C&#x27;.
*MR Medium Rigid: &#x27;Class MR&#x27; covers a rigid vehicle with 2 axles and a GVM of more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM. This class also includes vehicles in class &#x27;LR&#x27;.
*HR Heavy Rigid: &#x27;Class HR&#x27; covers a rigid vehicle with 3 or more axles and a GVM of more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM. This class also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class &#x27;MR&#x27;.
*HC Heavy Combination: This licence covers heavy combination vehicles like a prime mover towing a semi-trailer, or rigid vehicles towing a trailer with a GVM of more than . This class also includes vehicles in class &#x27;HR&#x27;.
*MC Multi-Combination: This licence covers multi-combination vehicles like Road Trains and B-Double Vehicles. It also includes vehicles in class &#x27;HC&#x27;.

===Medical standards===
The medical standards for drivers of commercial vehicles are set by the National Transport Commission and Austroads, and are set out in &#x27;Assessing Fitness to Drive&#x27; (available from the Austroads website).

For those applying for heavy vehicle licence classes MR (Medium Rigid), HR (Heavy Rigid), HC (Heavy Combination) or MC (Multi Combination), it is strongly recommended that the applicant ensures they meet the medical requirements before commencing any training or tests for a heavy vehicle licence.

===Paying passengers===
The driver of a vehicle carrying paying passengers (such as a school bus or tourist coach) requires an appropriate driver licence and a &#x27;Public Passenger Vehicle Driver Authority&#x27; which is issued by the Ministry of Transport.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, driver licensing is controlled by the NZ Transport Agency. There are six classes of motor-vehicle licence and nine licence endorsements. Class 1 governs vehicles with a GLW (gross laden weight) or GCW (gross combined weight) of less than 6,000 kg, and Class 6 governs motorcycles. Classes 2–5 govern heavy vehicles.

A Class 2 licence allows the holder to drive:
* any rigid vehicle (including any tractor) with a GLW of more than but less than 
* any combination vehicle with a GCW of or less
* any combination vehicle consisting of a rigid vehicle with a GLW of or less towing a light trailer (GLW of or less)
* any rigid vehicle with a GLW of more than that has no more than two axles
* any vehicle covered in Class 1.

Class 3 allows the holder to drive:
* any combination vehicle with a GCW of more than but less than 
* any vehicle covered in classes 1 and 2.

Class 4 allows the holder to drive:
* any rigid vehicle (including any tractor) with a GLW of more than 
* any combination vehicle consisting of a rigid vehicle with a GLW of more than towing a light trailer (GLW of or less)
* vehicles covered in classes 1 and 2, but not Class 3.

Class 5 allows the holder to drive:
* any combination vehicle with a GCW of more than 
* vehicles covered by classes 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Before getting a Class 2 licence, a driver must be at least 18 years of age and have held an unrestricted Class 1 licence for at least six months. Gaining a Class 5 is not dependent on holding a Class 3. Once a driver has a Class 2 they can progress straight through to Class 4 and Class 5. Each progression (2 to 3, 2 to 4, or 4 to 5) requires having held an unrestricted licence of the preceding class for at least six months. For drivers aged 25 or over the minimum period for holding the unrestricted time is reduced to three months, or waived entirely on completion of an approved course of instruction.

Additional endorsements on an NZ driver&#x27;s licence govern provision of special commercial services. The endorsements are:
*D - Dangerous Goods: transporting hazardous substances. Must be renewed every five years
*F - Forklift operator
*I - Driving Instructor: An &quot;I&quot; endorsement is awarded for a specific Class of licence, e.g.: 5-I
*O - Testing Officer: Driving assessors who test a person prior to being granted a particular class of licence
*P - Passenger: Transport of fare-paying passengers (bus and taxi drivers, limo-for-hire drivers, and dial-a-driver services)
*R - Roller: Special vehicle equipped with rollers
*T - Tracks: Special vehicle equipped with tracks
*V - Vehicle recovery: Operating a tow truck
*W - Wheels: Special vehicle equipped with wheels, other than fire appliances, buses, tractors, vehicle-recovery vehicles, or trade vehicles.

The F, R, T and W endorsements are for operating special types of vehicle on the road. Where the holder also has a heavy vehicle (Class 2 or Class 4) licence, they are permitted to drive heavy special vehicles. Otherwise the limits for Class 1 () apply.

Being granted an I, O, P and/or V endorsement requires that the applicant passes a &quot;fit and proper person&quot; check, to screen for people with criminal convictions or serious driving infringements. These endorsements are issued for one or five years, at the option of the applicant at the time of purchase.

== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong, Transport Department is responsible for issuing driver licences. Private light bus (class 4), public light bus (class 5), taxi (class 6), private bus (class 9), public bus (class 10), franchised public bus (class 17), medium goods vehicle (class 18), heavy goods vehicle (class 19), articulated vehicle (class 20) and special purpose vehicle (class 21) are vehicles requiring commercial driving licences., whereas private car (class 1), light goods vehicle (class 2), motorcycle (class 3), and motor tricycle (class 22) are considered non-commercial vehicles.

To apply for a commercial driving licence, a driver must:
- be of age 21 or above;
- have obtained a private car or light goods vehicle full driving licence for at least 3 years (2 years if converted from probationary licence) immediately before the application;
- be a Hong Kong permanent resident or not subject to any condition of stay other than a limit of stay;
- have not been convicted of some serious driving offences specified in law within 5 years before the application;
and take a driving test of the class of vehicle the driver is going to apply.

In Hong Kong, driving licences are issued separately for each class of vehicle and printed on the licence, although passing a driving test of a heavier vehicle automatically gives the driver the right to apply for corresponding lighter vehicles:
* 6 (Taxi) — Only a written test has to be taken, including traffic regulations, taxi regulations and places.
* 4 (Private light bus), 5 (Public light bus) — Passenger vehicles with 8 to 19 seats. The driving tests for both are the same, but only class 4 (private light bus) licence can be applied after passing the test. In order to apply for a class 5 (public light bus) licence, a driver has to take an additional Pre-service Training Course for Public Light Bus Drivers before submitting the application
* 9 (Private bus), 10 (Public bus) — Passenger vehicles with 20 seats or more. The driving tests for both are the same, and class 4 (private light bus) licence is issued automatically at the same time when applying class 9, 10 licences after passing the test. In addition, class 5 (public light bus) licence can be applied after taking an additional Pre-service Training Course for Public Light Bus Drivers.
* 17 (Franchised public bus) — This is obtained through training within a franchised bus company, for example, Kowloon Motor Bus. The driving test requirement is the same with public bus (class 10), and is only retained with historical interest. A driver passing a test on a franchised bus will be issued classes 4, 9, 10 in addition to 17, and 5 after taking an additional Pre-service Training Course for Public Light Bus Drivers, enabling him/her to drive any public buses, whereas a driver holding class 10 (public bus) licence can also drive franchised public bus. Class 17 exists because the government had to protect the interests of franchised bus companies, in the past, drivers trained by a franchised bus company could only get a class 17 licence, enabling him/her to drive franchised public bus only but not other public buses. This has been relaxed such that a driver passing test on a franchised public bus can get classes 9, 10 in addition to class 17, and original drivers holding class 17 without classes 9, 10 can also apply them for free without taking tests.
* 18 (Medium goods vehicles) — Goods vehicles with maximum gross weight above and not exceeding . Class 2 (light goods vehicles) licence is issued in addition to class 18 after passing the test.
* 19 (Heavy goods vehicles) — Goods vehicles with maximum gross weight above and not exceeding . Class 2 (light goods vehicles) and class 18 (medium goods vehicles) licences are issued in addition to class 19 after passing the test.
* 20 (Articulated vehicle) — Usually refers to vehicle in the form of truck and trailer combination (hence articulated, but not include tow vehicle), total weight between . The driver has to obtain full licence of class 18 (medium goods vehicles) at least before applying. Class 19 (heavy goods vehicles) licence is issued in addition to class 20 after passing the test.
* 21 (Special purpose vehicle) — Includes street washing vehicles, arrow vehicles, road maintenance vehicles, ice cream vehicles, etc. A driver has to apply with endorsement from his/her company, and holding a full licence of class 2 (light goods vehicle), 18 (medium goods vehicles) or 19 (heavy goods vehicles). Class 21 licence has to be used in conjunction with a class 2, 18 or 19 licence, allowing the driver to drive special purpose vehicles with maximum gross vehicle weight up to the goods vehicle licence the driver holds.

<text>The Fillmore East was rock promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s rock venue on Second Avenue near East 6th Street on the Lower East Side section of Manhattan, now called the East Village, in New York City. The venue was open from March 8, 1968, to June 27, 1971, and featured some of the biggest acts in rock music of that time. The Fillmore East was a companion to Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium, and its successor, the Fillmore West, in San Francisco.

==Pre-Fillmore East==
The theatre at 105 Second Avenue that became the Fillmore East was originally built as a Yiddish theater in 1925–26, designed by Harrison Wiseman in the Medieval Revival style, at a time when that section of Second Avenue was known as the &quot;Yiddish Theater District&quot; and the &quot;Jewish Rialto&quot; because of the numerous theatres that catered to a Yiddish-speaking audience. Called the Commodore Theater, and independently operated, it eventually was taken over by Loews Inc. and became a movie theater, the Loews Commodore. It later became the Village Theatre, owned by Roger Euster, with on-site management by Ben Barenholtz. When Bill Graham took over the theatre in 1968, it was unused and had fallen into disrepair. Despite the deceptively small front marquee and façade, the theater had a substantial capacity of almost 2,700.

==Fillmore East==
The venue provided Graham with an East Coast counterpart to his existing Fillmore in San Francisco, California. Opening on March 8, 1968, the Fillmore East quickly became known as &quot;The Church of Rock and Roll,&quot; with two-show, triple-bill concerts several nights a week. Graham would regularly alternate acts between the East and West Coast venues. Until early 1971, bands were booked to play two shows per night, at 8 pm and 11 pm, on both Friday and Saturday nights.

===Notable acts===
Among the notable acts to play the Fillmore East was Jimi Hendrix. His album &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; was recorded live on New Year&#x27;s Day 1970. British blues-rock trio Cream played the Fillmore East when it was called the &quot;Village Theater&quot; on September 20 &amp; 23, 1967. On Saturday, February 15, Chuck Berry took the stage as headliner with Johnny Winter (billed simply as “Winter”), British blues-rock band Savoy Brown, and Aorta as the supporting acts. It was a treat for New Yorkers to see the legend at their beloved Fillmore East. The evening’s shows were noteworthy not only for Berry’s knock-’em-dead sets, with Reality Sandwich, a NYC rock band, superbly laying down the beat, but also for the rare four-act bill. The following weekend, February 21-22, 1969, The Mothers of Invention, Buddy Miles Express, and Chicago played on the same bill. The Kinks played October 17 &amp; 18, 1969, supported by the Bonzo Dog Band. Ike &amp; Tina Turner played on January 9 &amp; 10, 1970, supported by Fats Domino. 

John Lennon and Yoko Ono sat in with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention at the theater on June 6, 1971. The Allman Brothers Band played so many shows at Fillmore East that they were sometimes called &quot;Bill Graham&#x27;s house band&quot;; additionally, the Grateful Dead played a total of 43 concerts at the theater from June 1968 through April 1971. Jefferson Airplane performed thirty-six shows (with member group Hot Tuna performing an additional four showsand Taj Mahal played eight shows at the venue, while Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young did four shows in September 1969 and six performances in June 1970. Led Zeppelin made four appearances in early 1969, opening for Iron Butterfly. Amateur film footage of their January 31 performance can be viewed at the Led Zeppelin website.

The Joshua Light Show, headed by Joshua White, was an integral part of many performances, with its psychedelic art lighting on a backdrop behind many live bands. From the summer of 1970, the Pig Light Show, under the direction of Marc L. Rubinstein, performed at the theater, becoming the de facto house light show. 

National Educational Television taped a show on September 23, 1970, for broadcast. It featured The Byrds, Elvin Bishop Group, Albert King, Sha Na Na, Van Morrison with psychedelic light show by Joe&#x27;s Lights (what The Joshua Light Show became known as after Joshua left in 1970). The Allman Brothers were also taped for broadcast but due to technical difficulties, the segment with them was not aired. The show, &quot;Welcome To Fillmore East&quot; was aired on WNET channel 13 in NYC and simulcast on WNEW-FM radio on October 10, 1970, at 10:00 pm in the NYC area. A thirty-minute clip from that show of the Allmans can be seen on YouTube.

===Live albums===

As the Bill Graham&#x27;s original Fillmore Auditorium on the West Coast, the Fillmore East quickly became an important venue on the fledgling rock music circuit in the late sixties. Because of its excellent acoustics, the enthusiastic and attentive audiences and Graham&#x27;s innovative way of handling the concert environment, the hall became a favorite spot for the recording of many live albums. Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts, on why they recorded their first live album there: &#x27;We realized that we got a better sound live and that we&#x27;re a live band...And we realized that the audience was a big part of what we did...There was no question about where to record a concert. New York crowds have always been great, but what made the Fillmore special was Bill Graham. He was the best promoter rock has ever had and you could feel his influence in every little single thing at the Fillmore. It was just special. The bands felt it and the crowd felt it and it lit all of us up. The Fillmore was the high octane gig to play in New York - or anywhere else, really...It was a great sounding room with a great crowd...The Fillmores were so professionally run, compared to anything else at the time. And he would gamble on acts, bringing in jazz and blues...and he had taken a chance on the Brothers.&#x27;

The list includes:
* The Allman Brothers Band – &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;. The breakthrough double album of the Allman Brothers Band, recorded on March 12 and 13, 1971, and released on Capricorn Records in July 1971.

* The Allman Brothers Band - &quot;Eat A Peach&quot;. The follow-up double album of studio and further Fillmore East Recordings, dedicated by the band to their lead guitar player Duane Allman, who died in a motor crash shortly after the release and initial success of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;.

===Closing===

Because of changes in the music industry and large growth in the concert industry, as exemplified by the increased prevalence of arena and stadium bookings, Graham closed the Fillmore East after only three years. The final concert took place on June 27, 1971, with three billed acts, The Allman Brothers Band, The J. Geils Band, Albert King, and special surprise guests Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash, Mountain, The Beach Boys, Country Joe McDonald in an invitation-only performance.

The concert was simulcast live by New York City radio stations WPLJ and WNEW-FM, with between-set banter by many of New York City&#x27;s then-trend-setting disc jockeys, including WPLJ&#x27;s Dave Herman and Vin Scelsa and WNEW-FM&#x27;s Scott Muni and Alison Steele.

The Allman Brothers Band set was released as the second disc of the deluxe edition/remastered version of their &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; (1972 and 2006) album. 

In 2014, a six-disc set featuring the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s early and late shows at the Fillmore East from March 12 and 13, 1971, including their performance on the venue&#x27;s final night of June 27, 1971, was issued as &quot;The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings&quot;.

==Afterlife==

On November 17, 1972, the Fillmore East reopened as Villageast with &quot;Virgin: A New Rock Opera Concert by The Mission&quot;. After a short run the Rock Opera closed and on December 15, 1972, Jerry Fuchs presented the opening night of concerts with a performance featuring Bloodrock, Elephants Memory, and Trapeze. On December 16, 1972, the bill was Bloodrock, Foghat and The Fabulous Rhinestones. Fuchs went on to present several other concerts at Villageast, including the New York Dolls and Teenage Lust on December 23, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley on December 27, Steve Miller Band and Seatrain on December 28, and Roy Buchanan and Crazy Horse on December 30 and 31, 1972.

The band KISS, in preparation for their first &quot;official&quot; show as a signed, professional act, rent the Fillmore East for rehearsals on December 24-30, 1973. The band returns to perform a press event to promote the new band on January 8, 1974. According to then manager Bill Aucoin, they were just trying to gauge the press reaction to the new shock rock band. 

On December 7, 1974, Barry Stuart (Stein), reopened the venue as the NFE Theatre (&quot;NFE&quot; stood for &quot;New Fillmore East&quot;) with a concert presenting Bachman-Turner Overdrive. On December 31, 1974, the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue headlined a bill that included Quicksilver Messenger Service and Hidden Strength. It operated through 1975, but was renamed the &quot;Village East&quot;, supposedly due to objections from Bill Graham over the use of the Fillmore name.

From 1980 to 1988, the renovated venue was home to The Saint, an early gay superclub. As of 2013, the former lobby building is owned by Apple Bank, which has a branch at street level, and the rest of the interior of the auditorium has been demolished and replaced with an apartment complex, Hudson East, with its entrance at 225 East 6th Street. The building at 105 Second Avenue is now part of the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District, created in October 2012. 

In October 2014, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation unveiled a historic plaque on the building at a ceremony featuring Joshua White of the Joshua Light Show and critic/guitarist Lenny Kaye.

Live Nation resurrected the Fillmore East name by rebranding the renovated Irving Plaza as &quot;The Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza&quot; on April 11, 2007, with English pop music singer and songwriter Lily Allen as the opening act. However, in May 2010 Live Nation conceded that the new name had not caught on and due to &quot;unrelenting demand&quot; the name &quot;Irving Plaza&quot; was restored beginning on June 23, 2010.

<text>Raymond Gilbert Davis (January 13, 1915 – September 3, 2003) was a United States Marine Corps four-star-general who had served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Davis was decorated several times, he was awarded the Navy Cross during World War II and the Medal of Honor during the Korean War. While serving as the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, he retired with over 33 years service in the Marine Corps on March 31, 1972.

General Davis had a close association with Marine Corps legend, Chesty Puller, having served with General Puller on Guadalcanal during World War II and in Korea during the Korean War. A middle school was built and named the &quot;General Ray Davis Middle School&quot;, in 2006, in Conyers, Georgia, near Stockbridge, where he had resided.

==Early years==

General Davis was born on January 13, 1915, in Fitzgerald, Georgia, and graduated in 1933 from Atlanta Technical High School, Atlanta, Georgia. He then entered the Georgia Institute of Technology, graduating in 1938 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering. While in college he was a member of the ROTC unit. After graduation, he resigned his commission in the U. S. Army Infantry Reserve to accept appointment as a Marine Corps second lieutenant on June 27, 1938.

==Marine Corps career==

===1939–1942===
In May 1939, Second Lieutenant Davis completed the Marine Officers&#x27; Basic School at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and began a year of service with the Marine detachment on board the in the Pacific. He returned to shore duty in July 1940 for weapons and artillery instruction at Quantico, Virginia, and Aberdeen, Maryland. Completing the training in February 1941, he was assigned to the 1st Antiaircraft Machine Gun Battery, 1st Marine Division at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He returned to the United States with the unit in April, and the following month was appointed battery executive officer, serving in that capacity at Parris Island, South Carolina, and Quantico. He was promoted to first lieutenant in August 1941. That September, he moved with the battery to the Marine Barracks, New River (later Camp Lejeune), North Carolina. Upon his promotion to captain in February 1942, he was named battery commander.

===World War II===
During World War II, Captain Davis participated in the Guadalcanal-Tulagi landings, the capture and defense of Guadalcanal, the Eastern New Guinea and Cape Gloucester campaigns, and the Peleliu operation.

Beginning in June 1942, he embarked with his unit for the Pacific area, landing at Guadalcanal two months later. After that campaign, he was appointed executive officer of the 1st Special Weapons Battalion, 1st Marine Division. He was promoted to major on February 28, 1943. In October of that year, he took over command of the battalion and served in that capacity at New Guinea and Cape Gloucester. In April 1944, while on Cape Gloucester, he was named commanding officer, 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division.

Davis&#x27; heroism while commanding the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines at Peleliu in September 1944 earned him the Navy Cross and the Purple Heart Medal. During the first hour of the Peleliu landing he was wounded. He refused evacuation, and on one occasion, due to heavy Marine casualties and point-blank Japanese cannon fire, the Japanese broke through, he personally rallied and led his men in fighting to re-establish defensive positions. In October 1944, he returned to Pavuvu and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

===1944–1950===
Returning to the United States in November 1944, he was assigned to Quantico as Tactical Inspector, Marine Corps Schools. He was named Chief of the Infantry Section, Marine Air-Infantry School, Quantico, in May 1945, and served in that post for two years before returning to the Pacific area in July 1947 to serve with the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade on Guam. He was the 1st Brigade&#x27;s assistant chief of staff, G-3 (Operations and Training), until August 1948, and from then until May 1949, was assistant chief of staff, G-4 (Logistics). Upon his return from Guam in May 1949, he was named Inspector-Instructor of the 9th Marine Corps Reserve Infantry Battalion in Chicago, Illinois. He served there until August 1950 when he embarked for South Korea.

===Korean War===

In South Korea, Davis commanded the 1st Battalion 7th Marines, from August to December 1950. During this time one of his men described him as, &quot;&quot;...from Georgia and soft spoken. No gruff, no bluff. Never talked down to you and made you feel comfortable in his presence.&quot;

During the 1st Marine Division&#x27;s fight to break out of the Chosin Reservoir area in North Korea during the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir on December 1, 1950, Davis led his battalion in and through fierce firefights with the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army from Yudam-ni to Hagru-ri. Davis led in front of his men all the way... marching his battalion at night over mountains in a driving snowstorm, he rescued and saved Fox Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Marines from annihilation at the Toktong Pass. This action also opened the blocked mountain pass to Hagaru-ri allowing two trapped Marine regiments to escape and link up with the rest of the 1st Division at Hagaru-ri. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor. The medal was presented to Davis by President Harry S. Truman in a White House ceremony on November 24, 1952.

Davis was also awarded two Silver Star Medals for gallantry in action, exposing himself to heavy enemy fire while leading and encouraging his men in the face of strong enemy opposition. He received the Legion of Merit with Combat &quot;V&quot; for exceptionally meritorious conduct and professional skill in welding the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines into a highly effective combat team. Later, as executive officer of the 7th Marines, from December 1950 to June 1951, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot; for his part in rebuilding the 7th Regiment in South Korea after the Chosin Reservoir campaign. He returned to the United States in June 1951 and was assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C.

===1952–1959===
Davis served with Headquarters Marine Corps at the Pentagon until June 1954. He served in the Operations Subsection, G-3, Division of Plans and Policies, until February 1952, when he took charge of the subsection. In April 1953, he became head of the Operations and Training Branch, G-3 Division. While serving in this capacity, he was promoted to full Colonel in October 1953.

The following July, he attended the Special Weapons Employment Course, Fleet Training Center, Norfolk, Virginia, under instruction. In September 1954, he entered the Senior Course, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. Upon completing the course in June 1955, he served consecutively as assistant director and, later, director, of the Senior School. In October 1957, he was again transferred to Washington, D. C., and served there as Assistant G-2, Headquarters Marine Corps, until August 1959.

===1960–1966===
In June 1960, Davis completed the course at the National War College in Washington, D.C. Assigned next to Headquarters, United States European Command, in Paris, France, he served from July 1960 through June 1963, as chief, Analysis Branch, J-2, Staff of the Commander in Chief, Europe. On July 1, 1963, he was promoted to Brigadier general while en route to the United States.

Davis&#x27; next assignment was in the Far East, where he served as assistant division commander, 3rd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force, on Okinawa, from October 1963 to November 1964. During this period, he also performed additional duty as commanding general, SEATO Expeditionary Brigade, EXLIGTAS, in the Philippines, during June 1964; and as commanding general, 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, in China Sea Contingency Operations, from August 2, to October 16, 1964.

In December 1964, he was assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps. He served as assistant director of personnel until March 1965, then served as assistant chief of staff, G-1, until March 1968. For his service in the latter capacity, he was awarded a second Legion of Merit medal. He was promoted to Major general in November 1966.

===Vietnam War===

In March 1968, he was sent to the South Vietnam and served until May 1968 as the Deputy Commanding General of the Provisional Corps. He then became commanding general, 3rd Marine Division until April 1969. When he took command of the division, he ordered Marine units to move out of their combat bases and engage the enemy. He had noted that the manning of the bases and the defensive posture they had developed was contrary to their normally aggressive style of fighting. As part of this change in tactics, he would order Operation Dewey Canyon in early 1969 to engage the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam in the A Shau Valley. During this battle, his son Miles Davis, a rifle company platoon commander in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, was wounded in action. For his service as commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division from May 22, 1968, until April 14, 1969, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. The South Vietnam government awarded him several decorations including three Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses.

====1969–1972====
In May 1969, Davis was assigned duty as deputy for education with additional duty as director, Education Center, Marine Corps Development and Education Command, Quantico, Virginia. After his promotion to Lieutenant general on July 1, 1970, he was reassigned duty as commanding general, Marine Corps Development and Education Command.

On February 23, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon nominated Davis for appointment to the grade of general and assignment to the position of Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate and he received his fourth star on March 12, 1971. General Davis served as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps until he retired from active duty on March 31, 1972.

==Post-Marine Corps career==

In 2003, General Davis (Ret.) participated in an independent investigative commission headed by retired Admiral Thomas H. Moorer. This commission investigated the details of the controversial 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident and determined, among other things, that the state of Israel had deliberately attacked an American ship in international waters, killing 34 U.S. sailors in the process and perpetrating an act of war. Also participating in the commission was Rear Admiral Merlin Staring and former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia James E. Akins. The so-called Moorer Commission submitted their findings to the United States government along with a request for a proper Congressional investigation of the attack. No investigation has been conducted.

==Military awards==
Davis&#x27; decorations and awards include:

===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Marine Corps Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Rein.). Place and date: Vicinity Hagaru-ri, Korea, 1 through 4 December 1950. Entered service at: Atlanta, Ga. Born: January 13, 1915, Fitzgerald, Ga.

Citation:
:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, in action against enemy aggressor forces. Although keenly aware that the operation involved breaking through a surrounding enemy and advancing 8 miles along primitive icy trails in the bitter cold with every passage disputed by a savage and determined foe, Lt. Col. Davis boldly led his Battalion into the attack in a daring attempt to relieve a beleaguered rifle company and to seize, hold, and defend a vital mountain pass controlling the only route available for two Marine Regiments in danger of being cut off by numerically superior hostile forces during their re-deployment to the port of Hungnam. When the Battalion immediately encountered strong opposition from entrenched enemy forces commanding high ground in the path of the advance, he promptly spearheaded his unit in a fierce attack up the steep, ice-covered slopes in the face of withering fire and, personally leading the assault groups in a hand-to-hand encounter, drove the hostile troops from their positions, rested his men, and reconnoitered the area under enemy fire to determine the best route for continuing the mission. Always in the thick of the fighting Lt. Col. Davis led his Battalion over 3 successive ridges in the deep snow in continuous attacks against the enemy and, constantly inspiring and encouraging his men throughout the night, brought his unit to a point within 1,500 yards of the surrounded rifle company by daybreak. Although knocked to the ground when a shell fragment struck his helmet and 2 bullets pierced his clothing, he arose and fought his way forward at the head of his men until he reached the isolated Marines. On the following morning, he bravely led his Battalion in securing the vital mountain pass from a strongly entrenched and numerically superior hostile force, carrying all his wounded with him, including 22 litter cases and numerous ambulatory patients. Despite repeated savage and heavy assaults by the enemy, he stubbornly held the vital terrain until the two Regiments of the Division had deployed through the pass and, on the morning of 4 December, led his Battalion into Hagaru-ri intact. By his superb leadership, outstanding courage, and brilliant tactical ability, Lt. Col. Davis was directly instrumental in saving the beleaguered rifle company from complete annihilation and enabled the two Marine Regiments to escape possible destruction. His valiant devotion to duty and unyielding fighting spirit in the face of almost insurmountable odds enhance and sustain the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

===Navy Cross citation===
Citation:
:The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Raymond Gilbert Davis (0–5831), Major, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Peleliu, Palau Islands from 15 to September 22, 1944. Although wounded during the first hour of landing, Major Davis refused evacuation to remain with his Battalion&#x27;s assault elements in many hazardous missions. On one occasion, when large gaps occurred in our front lines as the result of heavy casualties, and his right flank company was disorganized by point-blank enemy cannon fire following a successful nine hundred yard penetration through heavily defended lines, he rallied and personally led combined troops into these gaps to establish contact and maintain hasty defensive positions for the remainder of the night. Despite many casualties from close-range sniper fire, he remained in the vicinity of the front lines, coordinating artillery and Naval gunfire support with such effect that several determined counterattacks were repulsed. His outstanding courage, devotion to duty and leadership were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

===First Silver Star citation===
Citation:

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Gilbert Davis (MCSN: 0-5831), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy in Korea during the period 2 November to 8 November 1950. Lieutenant Colonel Davis was serving as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division on 3 November 1950. At about 0130, 3 November the enemy conducted a fierce, coordinated night attack against the First Battalion, Seventh Marines. Lieutenant Colonel Davis moved from point to point on the line wherever there was danger of the enemy breaking through, continually exposing himself to heavy enemy small arms and mortar fire without personal regard for his own safety. His display of leadership, initiative and courage was a constant inspiration to the officers and men about him. It was through his actions that the lines held and the enemy was repulsed. During the daylight hours of 3 November Lieutenant Colonel Davis maneuvered elements of his command in such a manner as to route the enemy. Once again Lieutenant Colonel Davis&#x27; display of leadership and courage acted as an inspiration to the officers and men of his command. It was a direct result of Lieutenant Colonel Davis&#x27; actions that the First Battalion was able to break through and continue the attack in its zone of action.

===Second Silver Star citation===
Citation:

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Gilbert Davis (MCSN: 0-5831), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 30 September 1950. Assigned the task of seizing two hills located at the southern end of the Seoul-Uijongbu corridor, Lieutenant Colonel Davis boldly led his battalion against a well-entrenched enemy force in the face of hostile small-arms, automatic-weapons and mortar fire. Keenly aware that the unit had been assembled and organized only six weeks previously and that this was its first attack, he advanced with the assault elements and, moving from platoon to platoon to encourage the men, inspired his battalion to rout the enemy and capture its objective quickly. By his marked courage, brilliant leadership and steadfast devotion to duty, Lieutenant Colonel Davis upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

<doc id="1165959" wikidata="Q6786504" url="?curid=1165959" title="Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)">
<text>Mater Dei High School is a private, Catholic, co-educational secondary school in Santa Ana, California, located in and administered by the Diocese of Orange. 

Mater Dei is nationally known for its strong sports programs, especially in football. It is ranked first in the United States for &quot;best high schools for athletes&quot; by school review company Niche. In 2014, Bleacher Report ranked it in the top five high schools in the U.S. for producing professional athletes. Over 68 percent of the student body participates in some role with a team, in one of the 25 different sports sponsored by the school. Altogether they have won 90 CIF, state, and national championships.

==History==
The Archdiocese of Los Angeles opened Mater Dei in 1950, the first Catholic high school in Orange County. The school had 111 students and a faculty of seven, including Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, plus principal Fr. Joseph Eyraud. In 1953 they were joined by the Patrician Brothers, who taught until 2005.

Enrollment grew rapidly. The school was originally designed for 800 students, but by 1964 was serving 1,800. In the 1970s it became the largest Catholic high school west of Chicago. Overcrowding persisted until 1987, when Santa Margarita Catholic High School opened in South Orange County.

In 2000, Mater Dei embarked on a major capital campaign to fund a new parking lot, chapel, library, and service buildings, as well as a spate of athletic facilities and, in 2019, a much-needed parking garage.

== Controversy ==
The school has received mixed attention in local media, due in part to scouting athletes from public high schools and offering scholarships, in order to reinforce their acclaimed football program.

In 2021, a lawsuit was filed alleging that systemic hazing pervaded the football program resulting in a &quot;brutal locker room altercation.&quot; This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in 2023. Another 2021 lawsuit alleged that two Mater Dei football players severely injured a classmate in an orchestrated attack. Orange County bishop Kevin Vann responded with a public statement supporting the school&#x27;s leadership and criticizing the &quot;media frenzy&quot;. The school announced it would commission an independent investigation into the allegations.

In January 2022, a female alumna of Mater Dei filed a lawsuit following the surfacing accusations of hazing, alleging that she was sexually assaulted by a former football coach during the late 1980s.

==Athletics==
Mater Dei High School&#x27;s teams are named the Monarchs, and their colors are red and grey. As of 2023, the school sponsors boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; teams at multiple levels in 25 sports in the Trinity League, part of CIF Southern Section:

* Baseball
* Basketball
* Beach Volleyball
* Cheerleading
* Cross-Country
* Football
* Golf
* Lacrosse
* Soccer
* Sailing
* Softball
* Swimming &amp; Diving
* Tennis
* Track &amp; Field
* Volleyball
* Water Polo
* Wrestling

In addition, boys&#x27; beach volleyball, e-sports, equestrian, ice hockey, and surfing are offered on a club level.

Known for their football and basketball programs, Mater Dei has also graduated professional athletes Robbie Rogers (soccer), Tiki Ghosn (mixed martial arts), and Greg Woepse (pole vault), as well as ten Olympians. A total of 15 players have been named Gatorade California State Players of the Year.

===Football===
The Mater Dei football team plays in CIF Southern Section Division 1. They most recently won the CIF State Championship during the 2024 season, and won national championships in 1994, 1996, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2023. As of 2022, three graduates have won the Heisman Trophy, John Huarte, Matt Leinart, and Bryce Young. 

In 2021 &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited Mater Dei&#x27;s football program and that of rival St. John Bosco for making high school football look like NCAA Division I competition in terms of recruiting, training, and facilities.

<doc id="1165960" wikidata="Q306169" url="?curid=1165960" title="Jim Fitzpatrick (politician)">
<text>James Fitzpatrick (born 4 April 1952) is a British politician and former firefighter who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1997 to 2019, for Poplar and Canning Town until 2010 and for Poplar and Limehouse until his retirement. He is a member of the Labour Party.

Fitzpatrick served as Minister of State for Farming and the Environment at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs during the Brown ministry. In June 2019, he announced that he would not seek re-election to Parliament.

== Early life ==
Fitzpatrick was born at Glasgow, Scotland, and educated locally at the Holyrood R.C. Secondary School in Crosshill. From 1970, he was a trainee with Tytrak in Glasgow, before moving to London in 1973 to become a driver with Mintex. In 1974, he joined the London Fire Brigade as a firefighter, being decorated with the Fire Brigade Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in 1994. He left the fire service when he was elected to the House of Commons in 1997.

Fitzpatrick was elected as Chairman of the Barking Constituency Labour Party, and served as Chairman of the Greater London Labour Party for seven years.

== Parliamentary career ==
=== Member of Parliament ===
Fitzpatrick was selected as the Labour candidate over two sitting MPs, Mildred Gordon and Nigel Spearing.

He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for the newly-created seat of Poplar and Canning Town in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets at the 1997 general election with a majority of 18,915. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 17 June 1997.

Fitzpatrick was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Alan Milburn in 1999, until Milburn became the Secretary of State for Health later in the same year. After the 2001 general election, Fitzpatrick was appointed to government by Tony Blair as an Assistant Government Whip, becoming a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury (Government Whip) in 2002. He was again promoted within the Whips Office in 2003 when he became the Vice-Chamberlain of HM&#x27;s Household.

==== 2005 Parliament ====
Fitzpatrick was re-elected in the 2005 general election, and was then appointed a junior minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, then John Prescott, with the role of Minister for London, a role he took with him on his subsequent move to the Department of Trade and Industry in May 2006. In 2007, he argued against a CWU strike saying it would harm their cause.

On 29 June 2007, he moved to become the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, with shipping, aviation and road safety amongst his responsibilities, and was replaced as Minister for London by Tessa Jowell.

In 2008, during the Christmas period, Fitzpatrick and his wife visited Bangladesh, touring the development projects supported by the Canary Wharf Group. The purpose of the trip was to re-visit the country since 1999, and see the regeneration projects that this group supports. During his visit, he visited the Football Academy in Dhaka, also to Jagannathpur and Sylhet, where many Bangladeshis in the UK originate from including many in his constituency. Fitzpatrick was promoted to Minister of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the June 2009 reshuffle. He kept this role until Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2010 General Election.

In August 2009, Fitzpatrick left a wedding at the London Muslim Centre when he was told it would be segregated by sex (gender). In a local newspaper article, he blamed the Islamic Forum Europe for encouraging segregation, though the couple claimed Fitzpatrick had &quot;hijacked [the wedding] for political gain&quot;. Fitzpatrick stated he had left the wedding as discreetly as possible: &quot;it was never my intention to offend Mr Islam and if he thinks that I done so then of course I will apologise to him&quot;.

==== 2010 Parliament ====
Following boundary changes, Fitzpatrick contested the newly-created Poplar and Limehouse constituency in 2010, and was returned with a 4.7% swing to Labour, contrary to the national swing against the Labour Party.

He was campaign manager for former Labour MP Oona King (Baroness King of Bow) in her unsuccessful attempt to be endorsed as the Labour candidate in the 2012 London Mayoral Election. From 2010 until his resignation in 2013, he served as Shadow Minister of State for Transport, covering aviation, shipping and road safety, his former ministerial brief. Fitzpatrick was a parliamentary supporter of Labour Friends of Israel.

In August 2013, he resigned from his front bench role as Shadow Transport Spokesman in order to vote against both Labour and Government motions on the use of chemical weapons in Syria stating he was &quot;opposed to military intervention in Syria, full stop&quot;.

==== 2015 and 2017 Parliament ====
In December 2015, Fitzpatrick voted for the use of UK air strikes in Syria against ISIS.

Fitzpatrick was one of 13 MPs to vote against triggering the 2017 general election.

Fitzpatrick has spoken of a desire to implement the decision of the 2016 Brexit referendum and was one of five Labour rebels to support Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal in March 2019; he has voted against proposals for softer forms of Brexit such as EEA membership, against party colleague Yvette Cooper&#x27;s amendment to delay Brexit to avoid no deal, and for then chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee Graham Brady&#x27;s amendment to weaken the Northern Irish backstop.

In June 2019, Fitzpatrick announced that he would not stand for re-election to Parliament, having said that the 2017 general election would be his last election.

== Personal life and honours ==

Fitzpatrick married firstly in 1980 Jane Lowe (now divorced), having a son and a daughter.

He married secondly in 2003 Dr Sheila Hunter . 

Admitted as a Freeman of the City of London in 2011, Fitzpatrick was elected to the Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights in 2017. A Younger Brother of Trinity House, Fitzpatrick is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, and in October 2021 was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Tower Hamlets.

<doc id="1165980" wikidata="Q4733578" url="?curid=1165980" title="Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia Vancouver">
<text>The Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia Vancouver, otherwise referred to as the Alma Mater Society or the AMS, is the student society of UBC Vancouver and represents more than 60,000 undergraduate and graduate students at UBC&#x27;s Vancouver campus and their affiliated colleges. The AMS also operates student services, businesses, resource groups and clubs. The AMS is a non-profit organization that exists to advocate for student viewpoints and ensure the needs of students are met by the University Administration and the Provincial and Federal governments. The Alma Mater Society is composed of a number of constituency organizations for undergraduate students, and works closely with the Graduate Student Society of UBC.

==Governance==
The highest decision-making body of the AMS is the Student Council. Meeting every two weeks during the Academic Year, and every three weeks during the summer, this body has representatives from each of the Schools and Faculties of UBC, the affiliate colleges: Regent College, Vancouver School of Theology, and St. Mark&#x27;s College, Vancouver as well as the five members of the Executive, and several non-voting positions including the two representatives of the Student Senate Caucus, the two Vancouver student members of the UBC Board of Governors, the Student Services Manager, and the Ombudsperson. Voting members of Council are the Directors of the Society (as defined under the Society Act of British Columbia) and are responsible for all high-level financial and legal decisions made by the AMS - including the overseeing of internal procedures (known as the Code of Procedure), a $22 million budget, the Student Union Building (known as the AMS Nest Building), and policy statements.

The operations of the AMS are governed by a five-member Executive, as well as a professional Managing Director, and the Student Services Manager. The Executive consists of the President, the Vice-President Academic and University Affairs, the Vice-President Finance, the Vice-President Administration, and the Vice-President External Affairs. Members of the Executive are elected in a campus-wide election each March, along with five Senators-at-Large to the UBC Senate, and two student representatives to the UBC Board of Governors.

===Elections===
Until February 2004, candidates running for Executive positions ran as part of a slate. The 2005 AMS election was the first election which the AMS saw electoral candidates run as independents. Past slates included Students for Students (more right-leaning candidates with strong support from athletes, fraternities and residences), Action Now/Students&#x27; Voice/SPAN-Student Progressive Action Network (more left-leaning candidates with strong support from students living off-campus, the safety community and resource groups) and the Radical Beer Faction (the longest-running slate in AMS history). 

The AMS elections have been characterized by low turnout. A number of initiatives have been undertaken to improve the level of engagement with the student society, and increase turnout levels. Voter Funded Media and the introduction of Condorcet method style voting for executive positions. Turnout in the 2009 election improved to 14.4%. Most recently, a 2013 Elections when the continuation of UPass was put on the referendum, AMS recorded a historic high of voter turnout was 43.9% 

===Student Administrative Commission===
The Student Administrative Commission (SAC) oversees over 350 student clubs within the AMS. It divides the clubs into 9 categories: Academic/Management, Community Service, Cultural/Identity/Social, Leisure/Hobby/Special Interest, Media/Arts/Performance, Rec/Athletic, Political/Social Action, Science, and Spiritual.

The SAC sets out procedures for constituting clubs and manages the space use within the Student Union Building as well as the general operation of AMS Clubs. They have the power to constitute or de-constitute a club, as well as direct a club to take actions in order to ensure rules and regulations are followed accordingly.

The SAC is chaired by the Vice President Administration of the AMS. It also has several AMS Directors and member at large sitting in the committee. The Vice Chair of SAC is an appointed student employee of the AMS.

==Initiatives and services==
One of the major projects that the AMS has undertaken is the New SUB Project in order to increase available space for student activities by 50% compared to the old Student Union Building. The initiative was approved by referendum in April 2008 and construction is slated to begin in 2012. The building is funded by an incremental increase in student fees, which will supply $80 million for the construction of the building. The building, more commonly referred to as the AMS Nest building, has of space, costing about $108.3 million (with $25 million from the university). The building opened during the summer of 2015.

The AMS runs many services for students on the UBC campus, including The Sexual Assault Support Centre (SASC), AMS Peer Support, the AMS Advocacy Office, the AMS Food Bank, AMS Tutoring, AMS Housing, AMS Entrepreneurship Hub (eHub), AMS Health and Dental, and Safewalk, a service for escorting students on campus safely. In addition, the AMS lobbies local and provincial governments and institutions for the benefit of the student body. For example, the AMS lobbied against the $16 million funding cuts to B.C. post-secondary institutions in 2009.

On September 25, 2012, the AMS founded Get OnBoard BC, a coalition of transit stakeholders in the Metro Vancouver region to lobby for increases to public transit funding. The organization continues to exist today as a separate registered not for profit under the BC Societies Act.

==Representation==
By paying student fees, a student becomes a member of the AMS. Membership entitles students to vote in AMS elections and referendums, and utilize the many services that are provided by the student society and the university.

In addition to being a member of the AMS, any UBC student is a member the respective constituent society that represents all the students in a given faculty. These groups, including the Arts Undergraduate Society, Science Undergraduate Society, Commerce Undergraduate Society and Engineering Undergraduate Society (the big four), as well as the hold the elections for their respective seats on AMS Council. Unlike the undergraduate programs with direct elections, Graduate Student seats on AMS council are appointed by the council of the Graduate Student Society, which is recognized by the University as the representative body of graduate students.

The AMS was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. Due to scandal, the AMS withdrew from CASA in the late 1990s, but later rejoined. In 2008, AMS Council voted to step down to Associate Membership, citing concerns over centralized control, costs and value. In October 2009, AMS Council voted to withdraw entirely from the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, however, this decision was overturned on March 31, 2010, until the AMS ultimately withdrew entirely in November 2011. The AMS is currently affiliated with the Undergraduates of Canadian Research Intensive Universities and voted to become a full member of the federal student coalition in May, 2021.

On December 1, 2013, the AMS formally founded the Alliance of British Columbia Students, a not for profit confederation of British Columbia student societies advocating for a better post-secondary landscape in BC. The organization at the time represented nine student associations. The AMS voted to leave the ABCS in 2015. Though the AMS is not affiliated with any provincial student federation, it has worked with the Simon Fraser Student Society and the BC Federation of Students to lobby the provincial government.

<text>Billund () is a town in Jutland, Denmark. With a population of 7,307 (1. January 2024), Billund is the second largest town in Billund Municipality, behind the municipal seat of Grindsted. It is located approximately east of Grindsted and west of Vejle.

Billund is the home of the Lego Group head office. The town&#x27;s economy developed from the 1930s when the Lego factory was established. In the 1960s, Billund grew rapidly, driven by the success of the company and the opening of Billund Airport, which is the second largest airport in Denmark.

Located in the town is the first Legoland theme park, Legoland Billund Resort, which opened in 1968 and attracts two million tourists per year. Other tourist attractions include Lalandia, the largest water park in Scandinavia, and an experience centre named Lego House.

==History==
Billund has long been part of the parish of Grene Kirke (&quot;Grove Church&quot;) whose original Romanesque building was first mentioned in 1291. The town&#x27;s name was first mentioned as &quot;Byllundt&quot; in 1454 and later as &quot;Billund&quot; in 1510 and &quot;Billundt&quot; in 1610. The name combines the words &quot;bee&quot; and &quot;grove&quot;, meaning a grove with bees.

In the mid-19th century, Billund consisted of just eight farms. One building incorporated an inn and a grocery store. By 1875, a blacksmith had been introduced. The town continued to develop with the establishment of a cooperative dairy in 1888 and a utility association in 1894.

In 1880, the town&#x27;s first windmill was built on the road between Vejle and Varde. In 1895, the mill burned to the ground but was rebuilt in 1897, this time in the style of Dutch windmills.

In the early 20th century, the town&#x27;s infrastructure was further developed with the establishment of a telephone line from Vejle in 1902 and an electricity plant in 1917. A road was built through the town and a railway line was built from Vejle to Billund and later extended to Grindsted in 1914.
In 1916, Ole Kirk Christiansen, who later founded The Lego Group, bought Billund Machine Joinery and Carpentry Business from master carpenter Steffen Pedersen, who had originally founded it in 1895. The business constructed houses during the summer and produced furniture in the winter. He invested in the town, creating a new dairy and the Skjoldbjerg church a few miles south of town.

In 1924, after his house and workshop burned down, Kirk Christiansen built a house at Hovedgaden in Billund with two stone lions placed at the entrance. Due to the impact of the Great Depression, people in the town were unable to afford to build houses, so in 1932, he began producing utility items such as ironing boards, stepladders and miniature toys. The toys became the main product of the business and in 1934, he named the toy factory &quot;Lego&quot;.

In the late 1930s Billund experienced growth due to the factories and began to build waterworks, a gymnasium, and the town hall, though the local power station was closed and relocated.

In 1942, during the Nazi German occupation of Denmark in World War II, the old Lego factory was destroyed by fire, but a new one was immediately erected. In 1946, the railway track from Grindsted was extended to the Lego factory. In the same year, the Lego company purchased a plastic moulding machine from an English company. Plastic Lego bricks were first released from the factory in 1949 and near the end of the 1950s wooden toys had fallen out of favour.

The 1950s saw a continued growth in the town&#x27;s population, which had risen from 249 residents in 1930 to 418 by 1950. This growth resulted in further expansion of the town with the construction of detached houses. In addition, Billund Housing Association was founded and, in 1953, created the first affordable housing on Ole Kirks Vej and Tværvej. In 1957, the railway station was closed.

In 1961, the old village school was expanded by joining it with a modern school building to form Billund School. In 1964, Billund Airport was inaugurated and opened to the public. It had been originally built as a private airfield by Lego.
Legoland Billund opened on 7 June 1968 and received 3,000 visitors on its opening day and 625,000 in its first year. It was the only Legoland until 1996, when other Legoland theme parks were built in Carlsbad, California, and Günzburg, Germany. The Esso Motor Hotel, which is now the Legoland Hotel, was designed by Ole Hagens Tegnestue and built in 1968.

Between 1970 and 2006, Billund&#x27;s population rose sharply to 6,020, driven by production at the Lego factories and offices and by the increasing number of tourist hotels. Several companies in the aviation industry also opened.

In 2010, a partnership of organisations that began with the Lego Foundation and the municipal government founded the Capital of Children, which provides opportunities for children to participate in community projects and holds an annual Children&#x27;s General Assembly. In 2020, Billund was the first town in Denmark to be designated as a UNICEF Child Friendly City, which demonstrates a commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

== Geography ==
Billund is located approximately from Grindsted, from Esbjerg, and from Vejle.

Billund Brook runs through the centre of Billund, starting as a small ditch in the westernmost side of Randbøl parish, and continuing west to Grindsted and Varde. The local terrain is mainly flat with sandy soil. To the south-west of Billund is Grene Sand, where inland sand dunes deposited sand onto nearby fields in stormy weather, requiring hedgerows to be planted. Local bogs were used to obtain peat as a source of fuel from ancient times. Local farmers practised heath farming, growing rye to produce bread. To the east and north of Billund, the moors fed large flocks of sheep, which were under attack from wolves, until the last wolf was shot in 1813. As conditions were excellent for beekeeping, beehives producing honey were documented in the fields in the 1650s and 1660s. Beekeeping declined with increasing cultivation of the land by local farmers.

As of August 2022, Billund had 6742 residents. The town has experienced growth due to recent rapid development. Billund Municipality grew to 27,016 in the same month, which was an increase from 26,133 recorded in 2007.

In the Middle Ages, the region was sparsely populated and centred around five or six parish churches that were built in the 12th century. There was no significant development in the population until towards the end of the Middle Ages. Near the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century, several small settlements appeared across the municipality, including Billund.

A period of population growth in the 16th century was followed by stagnation in the 17th century, due to wars and epidemics during this period. By 1700, the population began to grow once more, so that by the time of the census of 1787, there were 1,686 people living in the municipal area consisting of five parishes. By 1850, the municipal population had increased to 2,721.

From 1850 the municipality experienced strong population growth. The number of inhabitants rose from 2,721 to 3,816 in 1870. The population continued to rise to 5,350 in 1890 and 7,929 in 1916. In 1850, Grindsted was the largest town with 42 inhabitants, while Billund only consisted of a number of farms.

Between 1920 and 1970, the population of Billund Municipality doubled from 9,912 inhabitants in 1921 to 12,835 in 1940 and 20,030 in 1965. Driven by strong growth in industry, the population of Grene Parish, including Billund, rose from 994 in 1925 to 2,699 in 1970. In 1930, Billund was still a small village with only 249 residents. In 1950, the population of the village reached 418 residents and after this time that number increased rapidly.

Population growth exploded due to The Lego Group&#x27;s rapid expansion in the mid-1960s. By 1970, Billund Municipality had 21,073 residents. This rose to 24,915 in 1990 and 26,076 in 2005. Billund&#x27;s population also increased from 2,015 in 1970 to 6,034 in 2007. In 2007, the number of commuters was approximately 5,000 as there were twice as many jobs in the town than the local population could fill. This growth was driven by Lego, Legoland and Billund Airport.

== Economy ==
Since it was founded in 1932, The Lego Group has been based in Billund. Its headquarters, offices and factory are all situated in the town, close to Legoland. Historically the prosperity of the town has been closely tied with the success of the company. When Godtfred Kirk Christiansen took over The Lego Group as managing director in 1957 due to his father&#x27;s illness, the company experienced continued international and economic growth over several decades. Employment at the company grew from approximately 200 in 1960 to 1,000 in 1970, 3,000 in 1980, 7,000 in 1990 and 9,000 in the mid-1990s with half of employees living in Billund and the other half internationally. By 2022, the company employed 20,000 people, with over a quarter being employed in Billund. In 2003, local people in Billund faced the possibility of many job losses when the company was on the brink of collapse due to poor business decisions. Kirk Christiansen gave up his position as chief executive and ended the family&#x27;s ownership. The company recovered by selling off assets, including 70% of Legoland theme parks.

In 2010, Billund was ranked as the top place in Denmark with the highest employment in the experience industries (27.3%). One in four people (25.9%) living in the municipality worked in the traditional tourism industry, particularly in local attractions such as Lego, Legoland, Lalandia and Givskud Zoo. Only 1.4% were employed in the creative industries.

== Transport ==

=== Air ===
Billund is served by Billund Airport, which is the second largest airport in Denmark after Copenhagen. It began as a strip of land purchased by the Lego Group in 1962. The company built a private airfield with the aim to reach international customers more easily. In 1964, the ownership of the airfield was transferred to Billund Airport A.m.b.A. When it opened to the public in 1964, it comprised an old hangar, a runway of 1,660 metres in length and a single control tower. In its early years, the airport served approximately 4,000 passengers with only two domestic departures per day. Since then, Billund Airport has experienced major growth and now serves as West Denmark&#x27;s international airport with many flights to countries across the world. The 40,000 sq m passenger terminal has the capacity to serve 3.5 million passengers per year and the 35,000 cargo centre can handle 100,000 tonnes of goods per year. In 2022, 3,712,400 passengers passed through Billund Airport and 76,874 tons of air cargo were transported through the airport.

=== Rail ===
In 2014, a new Billund railway line was planned to connect Billund to the existing Vejle-Herning track at Jelling, with stations at Billund Airport and Legoland. The project was to be funded by the government&#x27;s Train Fund DK and was due to be completed in 2020. By 2021, the project had been cancelled. The old railway station located on Lindevej was demolished in 2018 to make way for the construction of new residential apartments.

== Education ==
Billund School is the municipality&#x27;s largest school. It educates approximately 700 students and has 100 staff employed at the school.

The International School of Billund located on Skolevej opened in 2013 with 60 students. Over the next ten years, the school expanded and in 2023 provided classes for 450 students.

== Religion ==
Grene Church is located near to Billund on Kirkevej. It is the main church in Grene parish, which has one parish council. It was built in 1891 to replace an earlier church using some of the remaining features, such as the bell, font and pulpit. Prior to its construction, the parish priest had worked to have the previous church that was situated in the south-west corner of the parish demolished. Construction began on 1 July 1891 and the church was completed in the summer of 1892. In 1991, the church was renovated and a new bell tower was added. An organ was also donated to the church by the Christiansen family.

Billund Church is part of the Billund Centre and a branch church of Grene Parish. It was conceived by Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, who wanted to fulfil his father&#x27;s wish to build a church in the town centre. In 1969, the Kirk Christiansen family, Ole Kirk&#x27;s foundation and the municipality planned the centre, which comprises other facilities, including a library, leisure centre, theatre and cafeteria. The church was built from 1971 and inaugurated on 15 April 1973. It features a church hall, adjoining congregation hall and a 17 metre high bell tower. In 1991, it was expanded to include a choir rehearsal room, meeting rooms and offices.

== Culture ==

=== Art and sculpture ===

In 1991, a 1.3 km Skulpturpark was established in the heart of Billund. It is a free nature trail maintained by Billund municipality that features a variety of art sculptures. Skulpturpark was developed by a working group with a vision to provide an artistic experience for residents and tourists in a natural environment. The route extends along Billund Brook between Billund Trotbane/Enggårdsskolen and the Skovparken quarter and was later expanded to include the area along the Billund Centre. The first sculpture erected on the route was &quot;Entrance&quot; by Niels Peter Bruun Nielsen. The working group aimed to purchase 25 to 35 sculptures over several years. These sculptures include &quot;The Star Animal&quot; by Harvey Martin, &quot;Three toy sculptures&quot; by Poul Bækhøj, &quot;Standing figure&quot; by Keld Moseholm Jørgensen and &quot;The Garden Wife&quot; by Lotte Olsen.

Billund municipality holds an annual sports and culture gala that takes place every spring to celebrate achievements in sports and culture. Candidates are nominated for the previous year and the awards are presented at an entertainment show.

=== Libraries and cultural facilities ===
Billund Centre is a cultural centre located in the middle of Billund. It was built in 1973 and was a gift from the Kirk Christiansen family and Ole Kirk&#x27;s Foundation to Billund Municipality. The centre incorporates several facilities for local residents, including Billund Library, Billund Church, Citizen Service, Grene Parish history archive and Billund School of Culture.

Billund Library was redesigned by Rosan Bosch to provide a creative space for children to play and learn. It was completed in 2016 and, in the same year, was nominated for a Danish Design Award.

== Sport and leisure ==
Billund Trotting Track provided equestrian sport for 50 years in Billund. In January 2021, the racetrack was purchased by KIRKBI A/S, the majority owner of Lego. The track was closed and the Sydjysk Equestrian Association planned to establish a new arena for equestrian sports. In place of the track, a 200,000 m2 urban district, Billund Travbyen was planned for construction starting in 2024.

Billund Bad, a public swimming pool opened in 1969. An outdoor pool was first opened to the public on 4 July 1969 and was inaugurated on 7 September 1969. The outdoor pool received 40,000 visitors in its first two months. An indoor pool was later inaugurated in 1985. After 35 years, a renovation project of the indoor pool was undertaken, funded by Billund Municipality, Ole Kirk&#x27;s Foundation and local residents and businesses.

== Tourism ==
Billund is a popular tourist destination for families. Many of the town&#x27;s attractions are connected by a Playline trail, which was designed to provide tourists with a safe, child-friendly path around the town. Legoland Billund Resort draws 2 million tourists per year to Billund.
Another visitor attraction, Lego House opened in September 2017. It was designed by Bjarke Ingels Group to have the appearance of a stack of Lego bricks and features restaurants, play zones and a public square.

Billund is also the location of Lalandia, the largest water park in Scandinavia. It is situated close to Legoland and includes a tropical water park named the Aquadome and other leisure activities, such as bowling, ice skating and mini golf. In the centre of town a Teddy Bear Art Museum is also open to visitors and is located in the former home of Godtfred Kirk Christiansen.

A children&#x27;s adventure park named WOW Park is situated ten minutes from Billund. It provides a tree-top adventure experience set within a forest.

<text>The Committee on Public Information (1917–1919), also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States under the Wilson administration created to influence public opinion to support the US in World War I, in particular, the US home front.

In just over 26 months (from April 14, 1917, to June 30, 1919) it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and to enlist public support against the foreign and perceived domestic attempts to stop America&#x27;s participation in the war. It is a notable example of propaganda in the United States.

==Organizational history==
===Establishment===
President Woodrow Wilson (the 28th president) established the Committee on Public Information (CPI) through on April 13, 1917. The committee consisted of George Creel (chairman) and as &quot;ex officio&quot; members the Secretaries of: State (Robert Lansing), War (Newton D. Baker), and the Navy (Josephus Daniels). The CPI was the first state bureau covering propaganda in the history of the United States.

Creel urged Wilson to create a government agency to coordinate &quot;not propaganda as the Germans defined it, but propaganda in the true sense of the word, meaning the &#x27;propagation of faith.&#x27;&quot; He was a journalist with years of experience on the &quot;Denver Post&quot; and the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; before accepting Wilson&#x27;s appointment to the CPI. He had a contentious relationship with Secretary Lansing.

===Activities===
Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the Committee on Public Information (CPI), headed by George Creel. Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda. Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men. CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds. Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels. They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages. Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people. The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs. Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war.

The CPI used material that was based on fact, but spun it to present an upbeat picture of the American war effort. In his memoirs, Creel claimed that the CPI routinely denied false or undocumented atrocity reports, fighting the crude propaganda efforts of &quot;patriotic organizations&quot; like the National Security League and the American Defense Society that preferred &quot;general thundering&quot; and wanted the CPI to &quot;preach a gospel of hate.&quot;

The committee used newsprint, posters, radio, telegraph, and movies to broadcast its message. It recruited about 75,000 &quot;Four Minute Men,&quot; volunteers who spoke about the war at social events for an ideal length of four minutes. They covered the draft, rationing, war bond drives, victory gardens and why America was fighting. They were advised to keep their message positive, always use their own words and avoid &quot;hymns of hate.&quot; For ten days in May 1917, the Four Minute Men were expected to promote &quot;Universal Service by Selective Draft&quot; in advance of national draft registration on June 5, 1917.

The CPI staged events designed for many different ethnic groups, in their language. For instance, Irish-American tenor John McCormack sang at Mount Vernon before an audience representing Irish-American organizations. The committee also targeted the American worker and, endorsed by Samuel Gompers, filled factories and offices with posters designed to promote the critical role of American labor in the success of the war effort.

As the war progressed, the depiction of the enemy evolved in CPI publications. Initially in 1917, CPI pamphlets emphasized the importance of defending democracy and liberty from the German state. Over time the distinction between the German state and the German people was blurred. By 1918, following German military advances, pamphlets depicted individuals of German descent living in the United States as a threat.

The CPI&#x27;s activities were so thorough that historians later stated, using the example of a typical midwestern American farm family, that

Creel wrote about the committee&#x27;s rejection of the word propaganda, saying: &quot;We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of facts.&quot;

A report published in 1940 by the Council on Foreign Relations credits the committee with creating &quot;the most efficient engine of war propaganda which the world had ever seen&quot;, producing a &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in public attitude toward US participation in WWI:

===Organizational structure===
During its lifetime, the organization had over twenty bureaus and divisions, with commissioner&#x27;s offices in nine foreign countries.

Both a News Division and a Films Division were established to help get out the war message. The CPI&#x27;s daily newspaper, called the &quot;Official Bulletin&quot;, began at eight pages and grew to 32. It was distributed to every newspaper, post office, government office, and military base. Stories were designed to report positive news. For example, the CPI promoted an image of well-equipped US troops preparing to face the Germans that were belied by the conditions visiting Congressmen reported. The CPI released three feature-length films: &quot;Pershing&#x27;s Crusaders&quot; (May 1918), &quot;America&#x27;s Answer (to the Hun)&quot; (August 1918), &quot;Under Four Flags&quot; (November 1918). They were unsophisticated attempts to impress the viewer with snippets of footage from the front, far less sensational than the &quot;crudely fantastical&quot; output of Hollywood in the same period.

To reach those Americans who might not read newspapers, attend meetings or watch movies, Creel created the Division of Pictorial Publicity. 
The Division produced 1438 designs for propaganda posters, cards buttons and cartoons in addition to 20000 &quot;lantern pictures&quot; (slides) to be used with the speeches. Charles Dana Gibson was America&#x27;s most popular illustrator and an ardent supporter of the war. When Creel asked him to assemble a group of artists to help design posters for the government, Gibson was more than eager to help. Famous illustrators such as James Montgomery Flagg, Joseph Pennell, Louis D. Fancher, and N. C. Wyeth were brought together to produce some of World War I&#x27;s most lasting images.

===Media incidents===
One early incident demonstrated the dangers of embroidering the truth. The CPI fed newspapers the story that ships escorting the First Division to Europe sank several German submarines, a story discredited when newsmen interviewed the ships&#x27; officers in England. Republican Senator Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania called for an investigation and the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the CPI &quot;the Committee on Public Misinformation.&quot; The incident turned the once compliant news publishing industry into skeptics. There is some confusion as to whether or not the claims are correct based upon subsequent information published by the CPI.

Early in 1918, the CPI made a premature announcement that &quot;the first American built battle planes are today en route to the front in France,&quot; but newspapers learned that the accompanying pictures were fake, there was only one plane, and it was still being tested. At other times, though the CPI could control in large measure what newspapers printed, its exaggerations were challenged and mocked in Congressional hearings. The committee&#x27;s overall tone also changed with time, shifting from its original belief in the power of facts to mobilization based on hate, like the slogan &quot;Stop the Hun!&quot; on posters showing a US soldier taking hold of a German soldier in the act of terrorizing a mother and child, all in support of war bond sales.

===International efforts===
The CPI extended its efforts overseas as well and found it had to tailor its work to its audience. In Latin America, its efforts were led where possible by American journalists with experience in the region, because, said one organizer, &quot;it is essentially a newspaperman&#x27;s job&quot; with the principal aim of keeping the public &quot;informed about war aims and activities.&quot; The Committee found the public bored with the battle pictures and stories of heroism supplied for years by the competing European powers. In Peru it found there was an audience for photos of shipyards and steel mills. In Chile it fielded requests for information about America&#x27;s approach to public health, forest protection, and urban policing. In some countries it provided reading rooms and language education. Twenty Mexican journalists were taken on a tour of the United States.

===Political conflict===
Creel used his overseas operations as a way to gain favor with congressmen who controlled the CPI&#x27;s funding, sending friends of congressmen on brief assignments to Europe. Some of his business arrangements drew congressional criticism as well, particularly his sale by competitive bidding of the sole right to distribute battlefield pictures. Despite hearings to air grievances against the CPI, the investigating committee passed its appropriation unanimously.

Creel also used the CPI&#x27;s ties to the newspaper publishing industry to trace the source of negative stories about Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, a former newsman and a political ally. He tracked them to Louis Howe, assistant to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and threatened to expose him to the President. As a Wilson partisan, Creel showed little respect for his congressional critics, and Wilson enjoyed how Creel expressed sentiments the President could not express himself.

===Termination and disestablishment===
Committee work was curtailed after July 1, 1918. Domestic activities stopped after the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Foreign operations ended June 30, 1919. Wilson abolished the CPI by executive order 3154 on August 21, 1919.

The Committee on Public Information was formally disestablished by an act of Congress on June 30, 1919, although the organization&#x27;s work had been formally completed months before. On August 21, 1919, the disbanded organization&#x27;s records were turned over to the Council of National Defense.

==Memoirs==
Creel later published his memoirs of his service with the CPI, &quot;How We Advertised America&quot;, in which he wrote:

:&quot;In no degree was the Committee an agency of censorship, a machinery of concealment or repression. Its emphasis throughout was on the open and the positive. At no point did it seek or exercise authorities under those war laws that limited the freedom of speech and press. In all things, from first to last, without halt or change, it was a plain publicity proposition, a vast enterprise in salesmanship, the world&#x27;s greatest adventures in advertising... We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of the facts.&quot;

==Criticism==
Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, provides a detailed critique of the Creel Commission in his 2010 book &quot;Death of the Liberal Class&quot;. He describes the CPI&#x27;s work as “a relentless campaign of manipulation of public opinion thinly disguised as journalism,” including manufactured German atrocities and war crimes.

Walter Lippmann, a Wilson adviser, journalist, and co-founder of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, who was influential with Wilson in his advocacy for the establishment of a pro-war propaganda committee in 1917, and who was &quot;associated with CPI propaganda&quot; in Europe in 1918, may have later been a critic of Creel. He had once written an editorial criticizing Creel for violating civil liberties, as Police Commissioner of Denver. Without naming Creel, he wrote in a memo to Wilson that censorship should &quot;never be entrusted to anyone who is not himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of suppression.&quot; After the war, Lippmann criticized the CPI&#x27;s work in Europe: &quot;The general tone of it was one of unmitigated brag accompanied by unmitigated gullibility, giving shell-shocked Europe to understand that a rich bumpkin had come to town with his pockets bulging and no desire except to please.&quot;

The Office of Censorship in World War II did not follow the CPI precedent. It used a system of voluntary co-operation with a code of conduct, and it did not disseminate government propaganda.

==Staff==
Among those who participated in the CPI&#x27;s work were:
* Edward Bernays, a pioneer in public relations and later theorist of the importance of propaganda to democratic governance. He directed the CPI&#x27;s &quot;Latin News Service&quot;. The CPI&#x27;s poor reputation prevented Bernays from handling American publicity at the 1919 Peace Conference as he wanted.
* Carl R. Byoir (18861957), like Bernays, a founding father of public relations in America.
* Maurice Lyons was the Secretary of the committee. Lyons was a journalist who got involved in politics when he became secretary to William F. McCombs, who was Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidential campaign of 1912.
* Charles Edward Merriam, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an adviser to several US Presidents.
* Ernest Poole. Poole was the co Director of the Foreign Press Bureau division. Poole was awarded the very first Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel, &quot;His Family&quot;.
* Dennis J. Sullivan, Manager of Domestic Distribution for films made by the CPI.
* Vira Boarman Whitehouse, director of the CPI&#x27;s office in Switzerland. She repeatedly crossed into Germany to deliver propaganda materials. She later told of her experiences in &quot;A Year as a Government Agent&quot; (1920).

<doc id="1166001" wikidata="Q6304524" url="?curid=1166001" title="Judy Marsales">
<text>Judy Marsales is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2007.

==Background==
Marsales was born and raised in Winnipeg, moving to Hamilton, Ontario in 1972. She began working in real estate in 1980, first as an agent, and then beginning her own business, &quot;Judy Marsales Real Estate Ltd.&quot;, in January 1988. In 1991, she became the first woman president of the Metropolitan Hamilton Real Estate Board. In 1996, president of the Hamilton and District Chamber of Commerce. She was appointed to the Hamilton Port Authority in 2001.

==Politics==
In the 2003 provincial election, Marsales won the riding. The seat was formerly held by NDP David Christopherson who had stepped down to enter the City of Hamilton mayoral race. During the campaign, she faced New Democrat Roy Adams and Progressive Conservative, Doug Brown. She won by just over 2,000 votes.

As a rookie MPP, Marsales proposed an anti-spam measure as private member&#x27;s bill in May, 2004, the province&#x27;s first, and was made a member of the legislature&#x27;s economic affairs and finance committee. She was passed over in the cabinet reshuffle of July 2005, but in March 2006 was made parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade. That appointment lasted less than a month. She was then appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Small Business and Entrepreneurship.

Marsales had been expected to seek re-election in the reapportioned riding of Hamilton Centre against NDP incumbent Andrea Horwath. However, a story ran in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; on July 12, 2007, indicating Marsales had instead decided to retire from provincial politics. She is currently the broker of record at Judy Marsales Real Estate in Hamilton, Ontario.

<doc id="1166014" wikidata="Q4698403" url="?curid=1166014" title="Aira Force">
<text>Aira Force is a waterfall in the English Lake District, in the civil parish of Matterdale and the county of Cumbria. The site of the waterfall is owned by the National Trust.

==Description==
The stream flowing over the waterfall is Aira Beck, which rises on the upper slopes of Stybarrow Dodd at a height of and flows north-easterly before turning south, blocked by the high heather-covered slopes of Gowbarrow Fell. It turns south on its eight-kilometre journey to join Ullswater, at a height of . One kilometre before entering the lake, the beck makes the leap down a rocky and steep sided ravine at the falls known as Aira Force. The water falls approximately to a rocky pool, from where the beck continues through a shallow valley to the lake.

The river name Aira is derived from Old Norse &quot;eyrr&quot;, a gravel bank, and Old Norse &quot;á&quot;, a river, hence &quot;the river at the gravel bank&quot;, a reference to Aira Point, a gravelly spit where the river enters Ullswater. The Old Norse word &quot;fors&quot;, waterfall, has been adopted into several northern English dialects and is widely used for waterfalls, with the English spelling &#x27;Force&#x27;. Thus, &quot;the waterfall on gravel-bank river&quot;.

==Tourism==

Aira Force lies on land owned by the National Trust. The Trust purchased the 750-acre Gowbarrow Park (on which the force lies) in 1906 and has provided facilities, such as car parking, disabled access, graded paths, and viewing platforms to make Aira Force one of the most famous and most visited waterfalls in the Lake District. The National Trust has also provided public lavatories, a café, and a visitor centre. The site is open to visitors throughout the year. A public footpath from the village of Dockray passes the waterfall.

Beside the walk that passes up the glen is located a good example of a Wish Tree, in this case using a large fallen tree trunk. Visitors hammer coins into it using stones from the site.

In 2015, Ullswater &#x27;Steamers&#x27; opened a jetty on the lake shore near Aira Force, making the waterfall accessible by foot passenger ferry from Glenridding. A footpath runs from Aira Force as far as Glencoyne Bay, but only a track exists from this point on.

==Bridges==
A small arched bridge spans the stream just as the beck goes over the falls giving views from the top. There is also a second bridge at the foot of the falls. Both bridges were constructed in honour of members of the Spring family early in the 20th century. Cecil Spring Rice was the British ambassador to the USA during the First World War, while Stephen Spring Rice was a senior civil servant. Lt Gerald Spring Rice of the 11th Battalion, Border Regiment was killed in 1916 during the First World War and buried in France. 

The bridges are of particular interest: the lower is made of vertical stones, not traditional in this area of Cumbria, while the higher has horizontal stones, more in keeping with the dale customs. 

In 2021, the lower bridge was rendered inaccessible after a tree fall during heavy storms. Access was restored by installing steel platforms.

==Poetry==
The Lake Poet William Wordsworth paid many visits to the area around Aira Force; he was probably inspired to write his poem &quot;Daffodils&quot;, with the opening line &quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud&quot;, as he and Dorothy Wordsworth observed daffodils growing on the shore of Ullswater near where Aira Beck enters the lake near Glencoyne Bay. The falls themselves are mentioned in three Wordsworth poems, the most famous reference being in &quot;The Somnambulist&quot;, where in the final verse he writes:

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, Airey Force, to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, refers to a legend that a hermit once lived beneath the falls.

<doc id="1166019" wikidata="Q1191535" url="?curid=1166019" title="RMS Tayleur">
<text>RMS &quot;Tayleur&quot; was a short-lived, full-rigged iron clipper ship chartered by the White Star Line. She was large, fast and technically advanced. She ran aground off Lambay Island and sank, on her maiden voyage, in 1854. Of more than 650 aboard, only 280 survived. She has been described as &quot;the first &quot;Titanic&quot;&quot;.

== History ==

=== Construction ===
&quot;Tayleur&quot; was designed by William Rennie of Liverpool and built at the Charles Tayleur Foundry at Warrington for owners Charles Moore &amp; Company (of Mooresfort, Lattin, Co Tipperary). She was launched in Warrington on the River Mersey on 4 October 1853 - it had taken just six months to build her. Prior to her launch, her future Captain John Noble had fallen into one of the seven holds and injured himself seriously. She was 230 feet in length with a 40-foot beam and displaced 1,750 tons, while 4,000 tons of cargo could be carried in holds 28 feet deep below three decks. &quot;Tayleur&quot; also had a net register tonnage of 2,500. She was named after Charles Tayleur, founder of the Vulcan Engineering Works, Bank Quay, Warrington.

Intended to begin her maiden voyage on November 20 1853, her large size resulted in the delay of her maiden voyage by 2 months. 

The new ship was chartered by White Star to serve the booming Australian trade routes, as transport to and from the colony was in high demand following the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851.

=== Disaster ===
&quot;Tayleur&quot; left Liverpool on 19 January 1854, on her maiden voyage, for Melbourne, Australia, with a complement of 627 passengers and 25 crew. She was mastered by 29-year-old Captain John Noble. During the inquiry, it was determined that her crew of 25 had only had 12 trained seamen amongst them, of which 8 could not speak English. It was reported in newspaper accounts that many of the crew were seeking free passage to Australia. Most of the crew were able to survive.

Her compasses did not work properly because of the iron hull. The crew believed that they were sailing south through the Irish Sea, but were actually travelling west towards Ireland. On 21 January 1854, within 48 hours of sailing, &quot;Tayleur&quot; found herself in a fog and a storm, heading straight for the island of Lambay. The rudder was undersized for her tonnage, so that she was unable to tack around the island. The rigging was also faulty; the ropes had not been properly stretched, so that they became slack, making it nearly impossible to control the sails. Despite dropping both anchors as soon as rocks were sighted, &quot;Tayleur&quot; ran aground on the east coast of Lambay Island, about 5 miles from Dublin Bay

Initially, attempts were made to lower the ship&#x27;s lifeboats, but the first one was smashed on the rocks. The second one drifted out into the Irish Sea; this lifeboat was eventually found in 1856. Then it was deemed that launching further boats was unsafe and unnecessary. &quot;Tayleur&quot; was so close to land that the crew were able to collapse a mast onto the shore, and some people aboard were able to jump onto land by clambering along the collapsed mast. Some who reached shore had carried ropes from the ship, allowing others to pull themselves to safety on the ropes. Captain Noble waited on board &quot;Tayleur&quot; until the last minute, then jumped towards shore, being rescued by one of the passengers.

With the storm and high seas continuing, the ship was then washed into deeper water. She sank to the bottom with only the tops of her masts and flags showing.

A surviving passenger alerted the coastguard station on the island. This passenger and four coast guards launched the coastguard galley. When they reached the wreck, they found the last survivor, William Vivers, who had climbed to the tops of the rigging and spent 14 hours there. He was rescued by the coastguards. On 2 March 1854, George Finlay, the chief boatman, was awarded an RNLI silver medal for this rescue.

Newspaper accounts blamed the crew for negligence, but the official Coroner&#x27;s Inquest absolved Captain Noble and placed the blame on the ship&#x27;s owners, accusing them of neglect for allowing the ship to depart without its compasses being properly adjusted. The Board of Trade, however, did fault the captain for not taking soundings, a standard practice when sailing in low visibility.
The causes of the wreck were complex and included:
* Compass problems due to the placing of an iron river steamer on the deck after the compasses had been swung.
* Absence of a mast head compass placed at a distance from the iron hull.
* Northerly current in the Irish sea similar to that which drove the &quot;Great Britain&quot; northward.
* Slotting effect of the wind in the sails driving the ship sideways.
* Large turning circle making the ship un-maneuverable.
* The anchor chains breaking when they were dropped in final efforts to save the ship.
* The captain being injured in a serious fall and possibly having head injuries as a result.
* Lack of lifebelts (then uncommon) and panic leading to increased loss of life.

&quot;Tayleur&quot; has been compared with RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. They shared similarities in their separate times. Both were RMS ships and White Star Liners (although these were different companies), and both went down on their maiden voyages. Inadequate or faulty equipment contributed to both disasters (faulty compasses and rigging for the &quot;Tayleur&quot;, and lack of life boats for the &quot;Titanic&quot;).

==Inquiries==
There were four official inquiries: 
* The inquest held at Malahide; 
* The Board of Trade Inquiry under Captain Walker; 
* The Admiralty investigation was chaired by Mr. Grantham, Inspector of Iron Ships; 
The Liverpool Maritime Board tried the fitness of Captain Noble to command. There are contradictions between these inquiries.

Estimates of the number of lives lost vary, as do the numbers on board. The latter are between 528 and 680, while the dead are ranged from 100 to 475, depending on source. Out of over 200 women on board, only three survived, possibly in part due to the heavy layers of clothing commonly worn by women of that era. Of the more than 50 children on board, only 2 survived. The survivors were then faced with having to get up an almost sheer 80 foot (24m) cliff to get to shelter. When word of the disaster reached the Irish mainland, the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company sent the steamer &quot;Prince&quot; to look for survivors. Recent research by Dr Edward J Bourke names 662 on board.

A memorial to those killed in the wreck was unveiled at Portrane (53.493441 -6.108558) on 16 May 1999.

In memory of those lost a &quot;Tayleur fund for the succour of shipwrecked strangers&quot;, was set up.

== Diving ==
The remains of the wreck were rediscovered in 1959 by members of the Irish Sub-Aqua Club. Because the wreck is over 100 years old (169 as of 12 July 2023) a license to dive the site must be obtained from the Office of Public Works.

The wreck lies at 17 metres depth some 30m off the southeast corner of Lambay Island in a small indentation at . Substantial wreckage includes the hull, side plates, a donkey engine and the lower mast. The woodwork was salvaged shortly after the wreck. Crockery and several pieces of the wreck are on display at Newbridge House, Donabate.

<text>The Kingston Flyer is a vintage steam train in the South Island of New Zealand at the southern end of Lake Wakatipu. It used 14 kilometres of preserved track that once formed a part of the Kingston Branch. Originally, Kingston Flyer was a passenger express train between Kingston, Gore, Invercargill, and less frequently, Dunedin. It was operated by the New Zealand Railways (NZR) from the 1890s to 1957. In 1971, NZR revitalised the service as a tourist venture, later leasing the locomotives and rolling stock in 1982 to a private company. Since then, the Kingston Flyer has been through a number of owners, most recently being owned by the Kingston Flyer Ltd. A group of volunteers has restored the railway, rolling stock and locomotives to service. In July 2021 the Kingston Flyer received resource consent to operate, initially for tour groups.

==History==

The Kingston Flyer was introduced in the late 1890s as New Zealand recovered from the Long Depression of the 1880s. During the Long Depression, slow mixed trains that carried both passengers and freight had served the Kingston Branch and Waimea Plains Railway, daily in some years and only a few times per week in others. However, as the economy was revitalised, the Railways Department sought to increase services on the two lines. The government acquired the Waimea Plains Railway and incorporated it into the national network. The Kingston Branch ran north–south between Invercargill and Kingston, while the Waimea Plains Railway diverged from the branch in Lumsden and ran eastwards, meeting the Main South Line in Gore. Mixed services operated to a higher frequency, and dedicated passenger trains were introduced. These services came to be known as the Kingston Flyer, especially the Gore-Kingston services across the Waimea Plains.
The Flyer served Kingston every weekday. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it ran Kingston-Gore, where it connected with Main South Line expresses between Dunedin and Invercargill. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it operated Kingston-Invercargill, using the length of the Kingston Branch. In the early years, services were typically operated by K and V class steam locomotives. At peak periods, especially Christmas and Easter, special services had to be operated to cater for demand, with some operating from Dunedin through to Kingston, where they connected with Lake Wakatipu steamboats to the popular holiday destination of Queenstown. For many years, this was the primary means of travelling to Queenstown.

===Demise===
In the 1930s, passenger numbers declined sharply and the Railways Department looked to cancel its services on the Kingston Branch. That occurred on 4 October 1937, bringing an end to the regular Flyers. Until 17 September 1945, an abbreviated service continued to operate across the Waimea Plain to the Kingston Branch junction in Lumsden. Then, on both lines, the service was replaced by buses operated by the New Zealand Railways Road Services.

That was not the end of the Flyers. The timetables retained a &quot;runs as required&quot; Kingston Flyer, which typically operated at peak holiday periods between Gore and sometimes Dunedin to Kingston. For many years, those expresses and excursions operated in conjunction with steamers on Lake Wakatipu, to provide the primary access to Queenstown. Patronage was initially heavy, but it declined through the 1950s. 1956 was the last year when Flyers ran each way in the same day, and the final Flyer operated during the 1957 Easter holiday period.

===Revitalisation===
In 1971, New Zealand Railways announced that it was going to recommence operating a service named the Kingston Flyer as a heritage service. The last use of steam on a regularly scheduled revenue service in New Zealand was on 26 October 1971, and the new Kingston Flyer began operating two months later on 21 December. It utilised the section of the Kingston Branch between Lumsden and Kingston and proved wildly popular. From 1971 until 1979 it operated every summer through to the Easter holiday period and carried over 30,000 people annually. Flooding damage to the line between Lumsden and Garston meant that the last Kingston to Invercargill flyer ran on 17 April 1979 and the damaged section of track in question was formally closed in November of that year. For the next three years, the Kingston Flyer operated from Invercargill to Bluff and Wairio, albeit less successfully.

In 1982, the Kingston Flyer was returned by NZR to Kingston before the remaining line now part of the Mossburn Branch was closed and removed. The initial intention was to utilise the remaining 20 kilometres of track between Garston and Kingston, but the decision was made to end the line in Fairlight and the additional six kilometres to Garston were closed. Although the original Flyers had typically been operated by locomotives of the Rogers K and V classes, two AB class 4-6-2 locomotives, AB 778 and AB 795 were restored specifically for the Kingston Flyer.

The Kingston Flyer normally operated seven months of the year, from 1 October to 30 April. Two trains ran daily, excluding Christmas Day.

In 1992, NZR&#x27;s successor, New Zealand Rail Limited (Tranz Rail from 1995), acquired Kingston Flyer Limited, which was sold again in 2003 by Toll NZ, then owners of Tranz Rail, to a private operator.

=== 2009 bankruptcy ===
In November 2008 the operation was offered for sale at $3 million as a going concern. In late August 2009 it was announced that the train would not operate again in the foreseeable future as mounting debt had forced the operation to close. Kingston Acquisitions tried to sell the train in November 2008 to repay about $4.7 million to Christchurch-based finance company Prudential.

Prudential blocked an initial offer by United States-based company Railmark to buy the operation for $2.25m, the insurers refusing to accept anything less than the whole debt being cleared. Invercargill-based enthusiast Karl Barkley formed the Kingston Flyer Steam Train Trust to preserve the Flyer under the auspices of a charitable trust but was unable to raise the necessary funds to purchase the Flyer from Prudential.

In November 2009, the Flyer&#x27;s owners were put into receivership and the train itself put up for sale.

In 2011 business was listed on the internet auction site TradeMe for sale with a price of NZD$2.5 million. That included the locomotives, all land associated with the railway, including the Kingston and Fairlight stations, and parts of the Kingston wharf, and several other development sites in Kingston which were not related to the railway. The business was purchased in August 2011 by businessman David Bryce who put it back in operation on 29 October 2011.

In December 2012 the Kingston Flyer was again suspended, due to the discovery of leaks in AB 778&#x27;s boiler and owner David Bryce&#x27;s ongoing health problems. The train resumed operation once the extensive overhaul of AB 795 was finished, and the business was once again put up for sale. As at December 2013 no offers had been accepted and the operation remained mothballed, the owner suggested that the Kingston Flyer could be put into a trust.

On 23 February 2017 it was announced that the Kingston Flyer and all associated land and buildings had been sold to a local consortium. Within two months it became apparent that the buyers were interested only in the land that the train runs on. Development West Coast said it was interested in buying the infrastructure and running the train on the West Coast railway network.

On 22 December 2017, it was announced that the train would remain in Kingston, and it was hoped that one AB class locomotive would 
be operational by February 2018.

In January 2018, the &quot;Mountain Scene&quot; newspaper announced that the land of the Kingston Flyer operation would be sold off for property development, but in early February 2018, it was reported that the new owners had &quot;big plans&quot; for the train. At the end of 2018, it was reported that a new operator planned to restart the service &quot;within a year&quot;.

At the start of 2020, it was reported that the train would be back in service at some time during the year. In May 2020 the new owners stated that their intention to restore the service by Summer 2020. In January 2021 the company applied for an operating consent to run trains again, but stated that it had no timeframe for when that might happen. In April 2021 the Kingston Flyer ran trains as part of Great Southern Train Tour, and in July the operation gained resource consent to operate. Initially the train will run only for group bookings during the 2021/2022 summer season, and will not run to a fixed schedule. Director of the Kingston Flyer Limited, Neville Simpson, stated that the train may run for the public on Sundays &quot;as the engine&#x27;s still warm.&quot;

=== Current status ===
On 18 September 2022, a grand reopening was held for services to be run between Kingston and Fairlight on Sundays from September to June. The service is being run voluntarily by a team of experienced train enthusiasts directed by Neville Simpson. 

In the 2023/2024 season, trains were scheduled to run from September to June on Sundays at 10:30AM and 2:00PM. 

==Locomotives and rolling stock==

The Kingston Flyer has been operated since 1971 by two AB class steam locomotives:
*AB 778 (entered service in 1925)
*AB 795 (entered service in 1927 and once pulled the New Zealand Royal Train)

From 2000 until 2003, K 92, a preserved member of the Rogers K class that headed the original Flyers, was based in Kingston and operated services both by itself and together with the AB engines. The locomotive was owned by the Waimea Plains Railway Trust and returned briefly during 2008-09 until the bankruptcy when it was recovered by the WPRT and moved to their base at Mandeville on the old Waimea Plains Railway in November that year and where it remains to date.

The Flyer also has a resident shunting locomotive, TR 350, a 15-tonne 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotive built by A &amp; G Price of Thames. This duty had been filled since the 1990s by 0-6-0DM DSA 551, which was recalled by Tranz Rail in 1999 and replaced by the smaller TR. The TR was used to shunt at Kingston and provide motive power for work trains during the winter shutdown. It remains there with the other locomotives and rolling stock in the compound.

Initially, the Flyer started out with seven wooden-bodied passenger carriages:
An eighth carriage was added by Tranz Rail in 1999. 56-foot steel-panelled passenger carriage A 1958 (TMS A 56595), a former mainline passenger carriage, was transferred from the Tranz Scenic carriage pool to the Kingston Flyer to bolster capacity. That was the only new rolling stock to have been added to the fleet since 1971 when the heritage Flyer began running. It is the most modern carriage in the fleet, although it is out of place with the other carriages.

This carriage was sold separately in 2015, and now can be seen on Huntingdon Street, where the new owners have placed it on a property just down from the railway line.

The Flyer also has a small collection of goods wagons, including three ballast wagons and an EP class plough van. The majority of the goods stock is used for Way and Works purposes, although there are three flat wagons used around the Kingston locomotive depot for maintenance purposes, primarily to hold locomotive parts.

<doc id="1166026" wikidata="Q251137" url="?curid=1166026" title="Knysna">
<text>Knysna (; ) is a town with 76,150 inhabitants (2019 mid-year estimates) in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is one of the destinations on the loosely defined Garden Route tourist route. It is situated 60 kilometres east of the city of George on the N2 highway, and 33 kilometres west of the Plettenberg Bay on the same road.

== Etymology ==
A number of explanations exist for the origins of the name, &#x27;Knysna&#x27; - including &#x27;xthys xna,&#x27; purportedly from a Khoekhoe language term that might have meant &#x27;place of timber&#x27;, &#x27;place of ferns&#x27;, or even &#x27;straight down&#x27; (referring to the cliffs at The Heads).

However, it is also likely that the name is related to, or a derivative of, similar place names that do or have existed in other parts of Africa. In colonial times Lake Malawi was known as Lake Nyasa (very similar to &#x27;Knysna&#x27;), while Webster&#x27;s Universal Unabridged Dictionary defines the word &#x27;nyanza&#x27; as a noun: &quot;(African): An expanse of water, as a lake or wide river&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Forty fossilised hominid footprints, dating to about 90,000 years ago, along with various other archaeological discoveries suggest that humans have lived in Knysna for well over 300,000 years. The first of these were various San Hunter-gatherer peoples who inhabited most of Southern Africa in paleolithic. The San were gradually displaced and absorbed by south migrating Khoekhoe peoples.

===Houtunqua (Outeniqua) Khoe===
The indigenous inhabitants of the Knysna area are a southern Khoekhoe people called the Houtunqua or Outeniqua. Their name means &quot;The People Who Bear Honey&quot;. From the Khoekhoegowab words , , and khoe rendered as qua meaning &quot;people&quot;.

Little is known about Houtunqua society prior to European contact. What little historical sources exist are not elaborate. It is suspected that at the height of the Houtunqua&#x27;s society, their territory stretched from the mouth of the Krom River in the east, along the Outeniqua Mountains which bear their name, up until the mouth of the Grootbrak River in the west.

The Houtunqua seem to have remained autonomous from the Inqua (Hamcumqua) expansion in the north with smaller Khoekhoe tribes like the Gamtobaqua coming into the fold of the Houtunqua to seek protection from the ever expanding Inqua to the north east. The Houtunqua were connected to trades routes with the Attaqua and Hessequa to the west.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the Houtunqua kept livestock and practised Nomadic Pastoralism but made extensive use of the resources in mountain forests. Excavations in the region have unearthed many caves showing signs of pre-colonial occupation.The discovery of shell middens at Knoetzie beach confirms the idea that like other Khoekhoe peoples, the Houtuniqua made use of the ocean for its resources.

Oral tradition among the Houtunqua tells how the Houtunqua held specific superstitions about Europeans and believed them to be &quot;baleful spirits&quot;. Thus the Houtunqua went out of their way to avoid contact with Europeans. Where other Khoekhoe tribes established formal relations and trade with Europeans, the Houtunqua receded deeper and deeper into the mountain forests. As a result the Houtunqua disappeared from the historical record for some time with some Houtunqua eventually assimilating into colonial society of the time. Chief Dikkop, who died in 1816, was the last recorded Chief of the Houtunqua.

===European settlement===

The first Europeans arrived in the area in 1760, and the farm &quot;Melkhoutkraal&quot; (literally translating from Afrikaans as &#x27;milk wood pen&#x27;) was established on the eastern shore of the Knysna Lagoon. Stephanus Terblans, the first European farmer to settle in the area, was given a loan permit to farm here in 1770.

Upon moving to Knysna George Rex, a British-born entrepreneur credited as being the founder of Knysna, acquired the loan rights to Melkhoutkraal in 1804 and later, in 1816, to the farm &quot;Welbedacht&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Eastford&quot;. He gave of Eastford to the Colonial Government, on which the Royal Navy established the township of Melville. Rex&#x27;s properties were sold when he died in 1839.

In April 1817, the transport brig , belonging to the Cape Town Dockyard, was the first European vessel to enter the Knysna Heads. She struck a rock, now known as Emu Rock, and was holed. Her crew ran &quot;Emu&quot; ashore to prevent her sinking. In late April arrived to render assistance. After surveying the area, &quot;Podargus&quot; sailed safely into the Knysna and retrieved &quot;Emu″&quot;s cargo.

The next major settler in Knysna was Captain Thomas Henry Duthie, who married Caroline, George Rex&#x27;s daughter, and bought a portion of the Uitzigt farm from his father-in-law which Rex had named &quot;Belvidere&quot;. The construction of a small Norman-style church was commissioned by Duthie on his property, and was consecrated in 1855. The settlement&#x27;s population grew slowly, and Englishmen such as Henry Barrington and Lt. Col. John Sutherland, who established the settlement of Newhaven on a portion of purchased land, settled in the area. At the time, Knysna was a field cornetcy of Plettenberg Bay within the Magisterial Division of George. In 1858, Knysna became a separate Magisterial Division, new stores and accommodation facilities were opened, and Knysna became the new commercial centre of the region.

On their way to New Zealand, the Thesen family who were travelling from Norway fancied the little hamlet of Knysna so much that they decided to stay, bringing with them their knowledge of commerce and sailing. Soon, timber was being exported to the Cape from the vast areas of forest surrounding Knysna, and a steam sawmill and small shipyard were established. Later, these were relocated to Paarden Island, later known as Thesen&#x27;s Island.

===Millwood Gold Rush===

In 1878, an important discovery was made in the area. A gold nugget was found in the Karatara River, near &quot;Ruigtevlei&quot;. Soon fortune hunters from all over the world arrived at the Millwood Forest in search of gold, and Millwood grew into a bustling town. Millwood was declared a gold field, the first in South Africa. However, soon not enough gold was being recovered to sustain a growing town, and the mining industry in the area collapsed. Some miners relocated to Knysna, bringing their little homes with them. One of the houses, known as &#x27;Millwood House&#x27;, now functions as a museum.

===Amalgamation and timber industry===

By 1880 over 1000 people had settled in Knysna. In 1882, the settlements of Newhaven, Melville and the &quot;wedge&quot; of land between the two villages were amalgamated to form the municipality of &#x27;The Knysna&#x27;, named after the Knysna River.

Knysna&#x27;s timber industry peaked when George Parkes arrived from Britain and saw the opportunity to use the hardwoods of the Knysna Forest for export to elsewhere in the country, and even overseas. He established the Knysna Forest Company, later renamed Geo. Parkes and Sons Ltd., which is still trading to this day.

=== 2017 Knysna fire ===
On June 7, 2017, fuelled by strong winds from a severe storm - the Cape Storm of 2017- coming in from the west, a fire swept through the town and surrounding areas. Killing 9 as a direct result of the fires and another 2 indirectly and displacing around 10,000 people from all walks of life. Initially reported as arson, the cause of the fire was later revealed to have been lightning.

==Geography==
The town is primarily built on the northern shore of a large warm-water estuary, known as the Knysna Lagoon, which is fed by the Knysna River. The estuary opens to the ocean after passing between two large headlands made up of Peninsula Formation quartzites. These are popularly known as &quot;The Heads&quot;, and have become infamous due to the loss of boats and fishermen passing through their treacherous and unpredictable waters. The &quot;Paquita&quot;, a German vessel, sank on the eastern side of the Knysna Heads in 1903. Near them are geological formations, known locally as &quot;The Map Stones.&quot; To the north of Knysna, Afro-Montane or temperate rainforest covers the hilly terrain for 20 km until changing to fynbos or macchia high in the Outeniqua Mountains. The eastern head is heavily developed, while the western head is partially protected by a private nature reserve, Featherbed Nature Reserve, developed and formerly owned by teacher and television presenter William Smith on land he inherited from his father, famed ichthyologist J. L. B. Smith.

===Climate===

Knysna has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). Summers are warm and winters mild. During the summer, the average maximum temperature reaches about and rarely goes above . The average maximum temperature during the winter months ranges in the area of to . Knysna has one of the richest rainfall percentages in South Africa with the wettest time of year being from October to November. Knysna stays green in all seasons, and its temperate climate makes it a tourist destination all year round.

==Tourism==
The town is a popular destination for both tourists and senior citizens entering retirement, especially among the British and former expatriates due to the year-round warm climate. Recently, the town has also become a preferred destination among golfers, as the town boasts several world class golf courses, including Pezula Golf Course, Simola Golf Course and the well established Knysna Golf Course situated on the lagoon. It is near the towns of Plettenberg Bay and George, where there are airports. Knysna is also home to Mitchell&#x27;s Brewery although the company no longer brews beers in the town. The forest, rivers, estuary, and ocean surrounding the town are dotted with hiking trails and plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities. Hikers, runners, kayakers, swimmers, and fishermen are known to be particularly fond of Knysna.

===Annual events===
Knysna hosts a variety of annual events, which draw local and international visitors alike. Such events include the Knysna Oyster Festival in late June and/or early July; the Pink Loerie Mardi Gras and Arts Festival at the end of April and/or beginning of May; the Knysna Speed Festival takes place in the first week of May, the highlight of the week being the Simola Hillclimb. The Rastafarian Earth Festival takes place at the end of July, celebrating Rastafarian religion, culture and lifestyle.

====Knysna Oyster Festival====

The Knysna Oyster Festival, held annually in late June/early July, is the town&#x27;s oldest event. The duration of the festival is ten days. It was first held in 1983. Approximately 200,000 oysters are consumed over the 10-day period. Many sporting activities take place, such as rugby, golf, bowls, squash, cycling and marathons. The Knysna Forest Marathon and Half Marathon, as well as the Rotary Cycle Tour, draw many sporting enthusiasts to the town. The COVID-19 pandemic deferred the 2020 festival to 2021.

===Knysna Speed Festival===
The best-known hillclimb event in South Africa is held annually in early May during the Knysna Speed Festival, currently known as The Simola Hillclimb. It is a four-day event, starting with a four day Fan Fest starting on the Thursday prior to the event, before track action starts with Classic Car Friday reserved for cars built prior to 1990 and restricted to 65 entries. The King of the Hill Challenge (limited to 84 entries), for unrestricted cars in various classes, takes place over the weekend. The Saturday is for practice and pre-qualifying, while Sunday features the &quot;hot&quot; cars taking on final qualifying and the final runs. The course length is up Simola Hill. It is very fast with the 2022 winning average speed being .. 2024 will be the fourteenth running of the event which was founded in 2009. There was no event in 2013 nor 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, it ran without spectators in 2021, with limited spectators in 2022 before returning to an unrestricted event in 2023. Former World Rally, and two-time World Rallycross, Champion Petter Solberg, former Formula One driver, and Le Mans winner, Mika Salo and five-time Finnish Rally champion Henning Solberg competed in the 2023 event.

==Coats of arms==

===Municipal arms===
The Knysna municipality assumed a coat of arms in 1959, and registered them with the Cape Provincial Administration on 24 June 1960.

The arms, which were designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton, are: &quot;Quarterly, I Or a white horse&#x27;s head couped at the neck proper; II Azure a fern frond in bend sinister Argent; III Azure a yellowwood tree Or; IV Or an elephant&#x27;s head caboshed proper&quot; (in layman&#x27;s terms: the shield is quartered, 1 a white horse&#x27;s head on a gold background, 2 a silver fern frond on a blue background, 3 a yellowwood tree on a blue background and 4 an elephant&#x27;s head on a gold background). The crest is a sailing ship, and the motto &quot;Concilio et prudentia&quot;.

===Divisional council arms===
The Knysna divisional council (the local authority for the rural areas outside the town) assumed a coat of arms in 1961 and registered them with the provincial administration on 28 July 1961.

The arms, designed by Schalk Pienaar, were: &quot;Per saltire, I Or on a mount Vert a stinkwood tree proper; II &amp; III Argent three bars wavy Azure; IV Vert the brig Knysna proper the sails charged with two lions rampant Gules and pennants flotant Azure&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms: the shield is divided into four sections by two diagonal lines, the top section displays a stinkwood tree on a golden background, the left and right sections display three wavy blue stripes against a silver background, and the bottom section displays a brig named &#x27;Knysna&#x27; with red lions on the sails and a blue pennant flying from the mast. The motto was &quot;Pulchra terra Dei donum&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Sablefish&quot; (SS/AGSS-303), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the sablefish, a large, dark fish found along North America&#x27;s Pacific coast from California to Alaska.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sablefish&quot; was laid down on 5 June 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company at their site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 4 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Carol S. Burrough, wife of Captain Edmund W. Burrough, the former commanding officer of the light cruiser . &quot;Sablefish&quot; was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia on 18 December 1945.

==Service history==
Following a shakedown cruise from Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, to Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Sablefish&quot; conducted type training in the Panama area until mid-May 1946. She then returned to her home port, New London, and spent the remainder of 1946 supporting antisubmarine warfare exercises off the United States East Coast, participating in fleet exercises off Bermuda, and making a three-week cruise off Greenland.

&quot;Sablefish&quot;′s duty in 1946 established a pattern for her operations during much of her subsequent career. Highlights of her service for the next few years included testing a new type of submarine escape buoy in January 1948 and again in September 1948; participating in ceremonies at Havana, Cuba, on 14 February 1948, the 50th anniversary of the sinking of the battleship ; conversion to a Fleet Snorkel submarine during the first half of 1951; and a starring role in one of Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;See It Now&quot; television shows.

On 15 July 1952, &quot;Sablefish&quot; broadened her experience by departing New London and proceeding to the Mediterranean Sea for her first deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet. After exercises with other U.S. warships and vessels of the navies of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies during the rest of the summer, &quot;Sablefish&quot; returned to New London in October 1952. Thereafter, she made six more deployments to the Mediterranean.

When operating on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Sablefish&quot; was busy with exercises which took her as far north as Nova Scotia, Canada, and south to the Caribbean.

In June 1959, &quot;Sablefish&quot; was one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s representatives at the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada, and she operated in the Great Lakes until mid-August 1959. A second cruise up the St. Lawrence River returned her to the Great Lakes in 1961.

In May 1967, &quot;Sablefish&quot; again headed east across the Atlantic, but this time, instead of transiting the Straits of Gibraltar for service with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, she visited ports in the British Isles and along the Atlantic coast of Europe in France, West Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. On her homeward voyage, she also stopped at Iceland.

&quot;Sablefish&quot; began her last Mediterranean deployment in the fall of 1968 and returned to New London on 1 February 1969. On 30 June 1969, while operating from New London, she was reclassified as an &quot;auxiliary submarine&quot; and accordingly redesignated AGSS-303.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Sablefish&quot; was decommissioned at New London on 1 November 1969 and struck from the Navy list the same day. She was subsequently stripped, then sold for scrap on 29 July 1971.

<text>Owen Sheers (born 20 September 1974) is a Welsh poet, author, playwright and television presenter. He was the first writer-in-residence to be appointed by any national rugby union team.

==Early life==
Owen Sheers was born in Suva, Fiji, and was brought up in Abergavenny, south Wales. He went to school at King Henry VIII School in Abergavenny, before studying at New College, Oxford, and the University of East Anglia, at which point he completed an MA in Creative Writing. During his time at New College, Sheers captained the Oxford University Modern Pentathlon team.

==Career==
In 1999, Sheers received an Eric Gregory Award from the Society of Authors. His first collection of poetry, &quot;The Blue Book&quot;, was published by Seren in 2000. A collection of poems about family, first love and farming life, it was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year and the Forward Prize for &quot;Best First Collection&quot;. Following this first publication, Sheers worked on the light entertainment television show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; as a researcher. His debut prose work, &quot;The Dust Diaries&quot;, was published by Faber in 2004. A non-fiction narrative set in Zimbabwe following the travels of Sheers&#x27; great-great-uncle, Arthur Shearly Cripps, it won the Wales Book of the Year in 2005, and was also shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s Ondaatje Prize.

In 2004, Sheers was Writer in Residence at The Wordsworth Trust and was selected as one of the Poetry Book Society&#x27;s 20 Next Generation Poets. His second collection of poetry, &quot;Skirrid Hill&quot; (Seren, 2005), won a 2006 Somerset Maugham Award. &quot;Unicorns, almost&quot;, his one-man play based on the life and poetry of the WWII poet Keith Douglas, was developed by the Old Vic, New Voices, and performed by Joseph Fiennes.

Sheers&#x27; first novel, &quot;Resistance&quot;, has been translated into ten languages and was short listed for the Writer&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain Best Book Award 2008 and won a 2008 Hospital Club Creative Award. The novel imagines that the D-day landings have failed and Wales has been occupied by the Nazis. While working as a tiler in the South Wales valleys one summer, Sheers had heard about the Auxiliary Units-secret civilian networks that, in the event of an invasion, would have formed a British resistance, but the novel focuses not on fighting &quot;but on the uneasy means of survival open to the women who are left behind&quot;. The film of the novel, which Sheers co-wrote, was released in autumn 2011 and starred Andrea Riseborough. Sheers insisted that the film be shot in and around the Black Mountains.

In 2007, he collaborated with composer Rachel Portman on &quot;The Water Diviner’s Tale&quot;, an oratorio for children, which was premièred at the Royal Albert Hall for the BBC Proms. In 2007/8 Sheers was a Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Fellow at the New York Public Library.

In 2009, he published the novella &quot;White Ravens&quot;, a contemporary response to the myth of Branwen Daughter of Llyr, written as part of Seren&#x27;s series of &quot;New Stories from the Mabinogion&quot;. He published an anthology of British landscape poetry to accompany his TV series of the same title, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;.

Sheers has also written journalism and reportage for a variety of publications including &quot;Granta&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Financial Times&quot;. He wrote a play for BBC Radio 4 about the World War II poet Alun Lewis: &quot;If I Should Go Away&quot;. In 2011, Sheers wrote the script and novelisation (&quot;The Gospel of Us&quot;) of &quot;The Passion&quot; for National Theatre Wales and WildWorks. &quot;The Gospel of Us&quot; has been re-published by Seren Press. Sheers worked with Michael Sheen co-creating the three-day passion play which unfolded over the Easter weekend of 2011 in Sheen&#x27;s hometown of Port Talbot. &quot;In Sheers&#x27;s Neath-flavoured take on the Bible, The Last Supper became pork pies and beer at the Social Club (with music from the Manic Street Preachers), while the Garden of Gethsemane was a scrubby patch of grass on a council estate. &quot; He participated in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty Six Books&quot; where he wrote a short play &quot;The Fair &amp; Tender&quot; based upon the Book of Ezekiel in the &quot;King James Bible&quot;.

In January 2012, Sheers wrote &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie F&quot;, a play based on the experiences of wounded soldiers, many of whom also made up the cast of the production, directed by Stephen Rayne and performed at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. The play has toured the UK and Canada and won the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award at the Edinburgh Festival. In 2014 his site-specific World War I play &quot;Mametz&quot; was produced by the National Theatre of Wales.

His verse drama &quot;Pink Mist&quot; was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and presents an elegy about camaraderie and loss in modern warfare as seen through the stories of serving soldiers in Afghanistan and their families. &quot;Pink Mist&quot; won the 2014 Welsh Book of the Year and was produced as a stage play by the Bristol Old Vic theatre in 2015, winning mentions as a top-ten pick of the year in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. In April 2015, Sheers&#x27; libretto for Mark Bowden&#x27;s oratorio &quot;A Violence of Gifts&quot; was premiered at St David&#x27;s Hall, Cardiff. The oratorio was devised as a contemporary response to Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot; oratorio, and was informed by three days research at CERN.

In 2014, Sheers presented a one-hour BBC documentary about the poetry of Dylan Kyte, for which he was shortlisted for a BAFTA Cymru for Best Presenter.

His novel &quot;I Saw A Man&quot; was published in 2015 in the UK, US and several countries across Europe. The French translation was shortlisted for the Prix Femina Etranger. 

His play &quot;Pink Mist&quot; was first staged at the Bristol Old Vic in 2015. It tells the story of three young Bristolians deployed to Afghanistan. It is their return home to the women in their lives that presents them with their bigger challenges as they all learn to cope with the physical and psychological after effects of war.

Owen is currently Professor of Creativity at Swansea University.

==Rugby union==
In December 2011, Sheers became the first writer-in-residence at the Welsh Rugby Union. Sheers played rugby union, representing Gwent County at scrum half.

==Actor and television presenter==
Sheers has played Wilfred Owen on stage and has presented arts programmes for BBC Wales.

In 2009, he wrote and presented the BBC 4 series about poetry and the British landscape, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;. He has also presented &quot;The Art of the Sea&quot; for BBC 4 and documentaries on the poets Keith Douglas and Dylan Kyte. Sheers has presented several programmes for BBC Radio 3 and 4. In 2008 he presented two episodes of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Open Book&quot; programme.

In October 2016, his &quot;film-poem&quot;, &quot;The Green Hollow&quot;, was broadcast by the BBC to commemorate 50 years since the Aberfan disaster of 1966.

<doc id="1166033" wikidata="Q1186057" url="?curid=1166033" title="Crime prevention through environmental design">
<text>Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is an agenda for manipulating the built environment to create safer neighborhoods.

It originated in the contiguous United States around 1960 when urban designers recognized that urban renewal strategies were risking the social framework needed for self-policing. Architect Oscar Newman created the concept of &quot;defensible space&quot;, developed further by criminologist C. Ray Jeffery, who coined the term &quot;CPTED&quot;. The growing interest in environmental criminology led to a detailed study of specific topics such as natural surveillance, access control, and territoriality. The &quot;broken window&quot; principle, that neglected zones invite crime, reinforced the need for good property maintenance to assert visible ownership of space. Appropriate environmental design can also increase the perceived likelihood of detection and apprehension, the most significant crime deterrent. There has also been a new interest in the interior design of prisons as an environment that significantly affects offending decisions.

Wide-ranging recommendations to architects include planting trees and shrubs, eliminating escape routes, correcting the use of lighting, and encouraging pedestrian and bicycle traffic in streets. Tests show that the application of CPTED measures reduces criminal activity.

==History==
CPTED was coined initially and formulated by criminologist C. Ray Jeffery. A more limited approach, termed defensible space, was developed concurrently by architect Oscar Newman. Both men built on the previous work of Elizabeth Wood, Jane Jacobs and Schlomo Angel. Jeffery&#x27;s book, &quot;Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design&quot; came out in 1971, but his work was ignored throughout the 1970s. Newman&#x27;s book, &quot;Defensible Space: – Crime Prevention through Urban Design&quot; came out in 1972. His principles were widely adopted but with mixed success. The defensible space approach was subsequently revised with additional built environment approaches supported by CPTED. Newman represented this as CPTED and credited Jeffery as the originator of the CPTED term. Newman&#x27;s CPTED-improved defensible space approach enjoyed broader success and resulted in a reexamination of Jeffery&#x27;s work. Jeffery continued to expand the multi-disciplinary aspects of the approach, advances which he published, with the last one published in 1990. The Jeffery CPTED model is more comprehensive than the Newman CPTED model, which limits itself to the built environment. Later, CPTED models were developed based on the Newman Model, with criminologist Tim Crowe being the most popular.

, CPTED is popularly understood to refer strictly to the Newman/Crowe type models, with the Jeffery model treated more as a multi-disciplinary approach to crime prevention that incorporates biology and psychology, a situation accepted even by Jeffery himself. (Robinson, 1996). A revision of CPTED, initiated in 1997 and termed 2nd Generation CPTED, adapts CPTED to offender individuality, further indicating that Jeffery&#x27;s work is not popularly considered to be already a part of CPTED. In 2012, Woodbridge introduced and developed CPTED in prison and showed how design flaws allowed criminals to keep offending.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Elizabeth Wood developed guidelines for addressing security issues while working with the Chicago Housing Authority, emphasizing design features that would support natural survivability. Her guidelines were never implemented, but they stimulated some of the original thinking that led to CPTED.

Jane Jacobs&#x27; book, &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; (1961), argued that urban diversity and vitality were being destroyed by urban planners and their urban renewal strategies. She was challenging the basic tenets of urban planning of the time: that neighborhoods should be isolated from each other, that an empty street is safer than a crowded one, and that the car represents progress over the pedestrian. An editor for Architectural Forum magazine (1952–1964), she had no formal training in urban planning, but her work emerged as a founding text for a new way of seeing cities. She felt that the way cities were being designed and built meant that the general public could not develop the social framework needed for effective self-policing. She pointed out that the new forms of urban design broke down many of the traditional controls on criminal behavior, for example, the ability of residents to watch the street and the presence of people using the street both night and day. She suggested that the lack of &quot;natural guardianship&quot; in the environment promoted crime. Jacobs developed the concept that crime flourishes when people do not meaningfully interact with their neighbors. In &quot;Death and Life&quot;, Jacobs listed the three attributes needed to make a city street safe: a clear distinction between private and public space; diversity of use; and a high level of pedestrian use of the sidewalks.

Schlomo Angel pioneered CPTED and studied under noted planner Christopher Alexander. Angel&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis, &quot;Discouraging Crime Through City Planning&quot;, (1968), was a study of street crime in Oakland, CA. In it, he states: &quot;The physical environment can exert a direct influence on crime settings by delineating territories, reducing or increasing accessibility by the creation or elimination of boundaries and circulation networks, and by facilitating surveillance by the citizenry and the police.&quot; He asserted that crime was inversely related to the level of activity on the street and that the commercial strip environment was particularly vulnerable to crime because it thinned out activity, making it easier for people to commit street crime. Angel developed and published CPTED concepts in 1970 in work supported and widely distributed by the United States Department of Justice (Luedtke, 1970).

===1970s===
The phrase crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) was first used by C. Ray Jeffery, a criminologist from Florida State University. The phrase began to gain acceptance after publishing his 1971 book of the same name.

:Jeffery&#x27;s work was based on the precepts of experimental psychology represented in modern learning theory. (Jeffery and Zahm, 1993:329) Jeffery&#x27;s CPTED concept arose out of his experiences with a rehabilitative project in Washington, D.C., that attempted to control the school environment of juveniles in the area. Rooted deeply in the psychological learning theory of B.F. Skinner, Jeffery&#x27;s CPTED approach emphasized the role of the physical environment in the development of pleasurable and painful experiences for the offender that would have the capacity to alter behavioral outcomes. His original CPTED model was a stimulus-response (S-R) model positing that the organism learned from environmental punishments and reinforcements. Jeffery &quot;emphasized material rewards ... and the use of the physical environment to control behavior&quot; (Jeffery and Zahm, 1993:330). The major idea here was that by removing the reinforcements for crime, it would not occur. (Robinson, 1996)

An often overlooked contribution of Jeffery in his 1971 book is outlining four critical factors in crime prevention that have stood the test of time. These are the degrees to which one can manipulate the opportunity for a crime to occur, the motivation for the crime to occur, the risk to the offender if the crime occurs, and the history of the offender who might consider committing the crime. The first three of these are within the control of the potential victim while the last is not.

Jeffery&#x27;s work was ignored throughout the 1970s for reasons that have received little attention. Jeffery explains that when the world wanted prescriptive design solutions, his work presented a comprehensive theory and used it to identify a wide range of crime prevention functions that should drive design and management standards.

Concurrent with Jeffery&#x27;s essentially theoretical work was Oscar Newman and George Rand&#x27;s empirical study of the crime-environment connection conducted in the early 1970s. As an architect, Newman emphasized the specific design features, an emphasis missing in Jeffery&#x27;s work. Newman&#x27;s &quot;Defensible Space – Crime Prevention through Urban Design (1972) includes an extensive discussion of crime related to the physical form of housing based on crime data analysis from New York City public housing. &quot;Defensible Space&quot; changed the nature of the crime prevention and environmental design field. Within two years of its publication, substantial federal funding became available to demonstrate and study defensible space concepts.

As established by Newman, defensible space must contain two components. First, defensible space should allow people to see and be seen continuously. Ultimately, this diminishes residents&#x27; fear because they know that a potential offender can easily be observed, identified, and apprehended. Second, people must be willing to intervene or report crime when it occurs. Increasing the sense of security in settings where people live, and work encourages people to take control of the areas and assume a role of ownership. When people feel safe in their neighborhoods, they are more likely to interact with one another and intervene when crime occurs. These remain central to most implementations of CPTED .

In 1977, Jeffery&#x27;s second edition of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design expanded his theoretical approach to embrace a more complex model of behavior in which variable physical environments, offender behavior as individuals, and behavior of individual members of the general public have reciprocal influences on one another. This laid the foundation for Jeffery to develop a behavioral model to predict the effects of modifying both the external and internal environments of individual offenders.

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the defensible space prescriptions of the 1970s were determined to have mixed effectiveness. They worked best in residential settings, especially where residents were relatively free to respond to cues to increase social interaction. Defensible space design tools were observed to be marginally effective in institutional and commercial settings. As a result, Newman and others moved to improve defensible space, adding CPTED-based features. They also deemphasized less effective aspects of defensible space. Contributions to the advance of CPTED in the 1980s included:

*The &quot;broken windows&quot; theory, put forth by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in 1982, explored the impact that visible deterioration and neglect in neighborhoods have on behavior. Property maintenance was added as a CPTED strategy on par with surveillance, access control, and territoriality. The Broken Windows theory may go hand in hand with CPTED. Crime is attracted to the areas that are not taken care of or that have been abandoned. CPTED adds a feeling of pride and ownership to the community. With no more &quot;broken windows&quot; in specific neighborhoods, crime will continue to decline and eventually fall out entirely.
*Canadian academicians Patricia and Paul Brantingham published Environmental Criminology in 1981. According to the authors, a crime occurs when all essential elements are present. These elements include a law, an offender, a target, and a place. They characterize these as &quot;the four dimensions of crime,&quot; with environmental criminology studying the last of the four dimensions.
*British criminologists Ronald V. Clarke and Patricia Mayhew developed their &quot;situational crime prevention&quot; approach: reducing the opportunity to offend by improving the design and management of the environment.
*Criminologist Timothy Crowe developed his CPTED training programs.

===1990s===
&quot;Criminology: An Interdisciplinary Approach&quot; (1990) was Jeffery&#x27;s final contribution to CPTED. The Jeffery CPTED model evolved to one which assumes that
:The environment never influences behavior directly, but only through the brain. Any model of crime prevention must include both the brain and the physical environment. ... Because the approach contained in Jeffery&#x27;s CPTED model is today based on many fields, including scientific knowledge of modern brain sciences, a focus on only external environmental crime prevention is inadequate as it ignores another entire dimension of CPTED – i.e., the internal environment. (Robinson, 1996)

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (1991) by criminologist Tim Crowe provided a solid foundation for CPTED&#x27;s progress throughout the 1990s.

From 1994 through 2002, Sparta Consulting Corporation, led by Severin Sorensen, CPP, managed the US Government&#x27;s largest CPTED technical assistance and training program titled Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) in Public Housing Technical Assistance and Training Program, funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. During this period, Sorensen worked with Ronald V. Clarke and the Sparta team to develop a new CPTED Curriculum that used Situational Crime Prevention as an underlying theoretical basis for CPTED measures. A curriculum was developed and trained for public and assisted housing stakeholders, and follow-up CPTED assessments were conducted at various sites. The Sparta-led CPTED projects showed statistical reductions in self-reported FBI UCR Part I crimes between 17% and 76% depending on the basket of CPTED measures employed in specific high-crime, low-income settings in the United States.

In 1996, Oscar Newman published an update to his earlier CPTED works, titled, &quot;Creating Defensible Space&quot;, Institute for Community Design Analysis, Office of Planning and Development Research (PDR), US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In 1997, Greg Saville and Gerry Cleveland, 2nd Generation CPTED, wrote an article exhorting CPTED practitioners to consider the original social ecology origins of CPTED, including social and psychological issues beyond the built environment.

===2000s===
, elements of the CPTED approach had gained wide international acceptance due to law enforcement efforts to embrace it. The CPTED term &quot;environment&quot; is commonly used to refer to the external environment of the place. Jeffery&#x27;s intention that CPTED also embrace the internal environment of the offender seems to have been lost, even on those promoting the expansion of CPTED to include social ecology and psychology under the banner of 2nd Generation CPTED.

In 2012, Woodbridge introduced and developed the concept of CPTED within a prison environment, a place where crime continues after conviction. Jeffery&#x27;s understanding of the criminal mind from his study in rehabilitative facilities over forty years ago was now being used to reduce crime in those same types of facilities. Woodbridge showed how prison design allowed offending to continue and introduced changes to reduce crime.

CPTED techniques are increasingly benefiting from integration with design technologies. For instance, models of proposed buildings developed in Building Information Modeling may be imported into video game engines to assess their resilience to different forms of crime.

==Strategies for the built environment==
CPTED strategies rely on influencing offender decisions that precede criminal acts. Research into criminal behavior shows that the decision to offend or not to offend is more influenced by cues to the perceived risk of being caught than by cues to reward or ease of entry. The certainty of being caught is the central deterrence for criminals, not the severity of the punishment. By emphasizing a certainty of capture, criminal actions can be decreased. Consistent with this research, CPTED-based strategies enhance the perceived risk of detection and apprehension.

Consistent with the widespread implementation of defensible space guidelines in the 1970s, most implementations of CPTED were based solely upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime, and improve the quality of life. Built environment implementations of CPTED seek to dissuade offenders from committing crimes by manipulating the built environment in which those crimes occur. The six main concepts, according to Moffat, are territoriality, surveillance, access control, image/maintenance, activity support, and target hardening. Applying these strategies is crucial when trying to prevent crime in any neighborhood, whether crime-ridden or not.

Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures. Image/maintenance and activity support provide the community with reassurance and the ability to inhibit crime through citizen activities. Target hardening strategies work within CPTED, delaying entry sufficiently to ensure a certainty of capture in the criminal mind.

===Natural surveillance===

Natural surveillance increases the perceived risk of attempting deviant actions by improving the visibility of potential offenders to the general public. Natural surveillance occurs by designing the placement of physical features, activities, and people in such a way as to maximize the visibility of the space and its users, fostering positive social interaction among legitimate users of private and public space. Potential offenders feel increased scrutiny and thus inherently perceive an increase in risk. This perceived increase in risk extends to the perceived lack of viable and covert escape routes.
*Design streets to increase pedestrian and bicycle traffic
*Place windows overlooking sidewalks and parking lots.
*Leave window shades open.
*Use passing vehicular traffic as a surveillance asset.
*Create landscape designs that provide surveillance, especially near designated and opportunistic entry points.
*Use the shortest, least sight-limiting fence appropriate for the situation.
*Use transparent weather vestibules at building entrances.
*When creating lighting design, avoid poorly placed lights that create blind spots for potential observers and miss critical areas. Ensure potential problem areas are well lit: pathways, stairs, entrances/exits, parking areas, ATMs, phone kiosks, mailboxes, bus stops, children&#x27;s play areas, recreation areas, pools, laundry rooms, storage areas, dumpster and recycling areas, etc.
*Avoid too-bright security lighting that creates blinding glare and deep shadows, hindering potential observers&#x27; views. Eyes adapt to night lighting and have trouble adjusting to severe lighting disparities. Using lower-intensity lights often requires more fixtures.
*Use shielded or cut-off luminaires to control glare.
*Place lighting along pathways and other pedestrian-use areas at proper heights for lighting the faces of the people in the space (and to identify the faces of potential attackers).
*Use curved streets with multiple viewpoints to multiple houses&#x27; entrances, making the escape route difficult to follow.

Mechanical and organizational measures can complement natural surveillance measures. For example, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can be added in areas where window surveillance is unavailable.

===Natural access control===

Natural access control limits the opportunity for crime by taking steps to differentiate between public space and private space. Natural access control occurs by selectively placing entrances and exits, fencing, lighting, and landscape to limit access or control flow.
*Use a single, clearly identifiable point of entry
*Use structures to divert persons to reception areas
*Incorporate maze entrances in public restrooms. This avoids the isolation that is produced by an anteroom or double-door entry system
*Use low, thorny bushes beneath ground-level windows. Use rambling or climbing thorny plants next to fences to discourage intrusion.
*Eliminate design features that provide access to roofs or upper levels
*In the front yard, use waist-level, picket-type fencing along residential property lines to control access and encourage surveillance.
*Use a locking gate between the front and backyards.
*Use shoulder-level, open-type fencing along lateral residential property lines between side yards and extending to between backyards. They should be sufficiently unencumbered with landscaping to promote social interaction between neighbors.
*Use substantial, high, closed fencing (for example, masonry) between a backyard and a public alley instead of a wall that blocks the view from all angles.

Natural access control complements mechanical and operational access control measures, such as target hardening.

===Natural territorial reinforcement===

Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through an increased space definition and improved proprietary concern.
An environment designed to delineate private space does two things. First, it creates a sense of ownership. Owners have a vested interest and are more likely to challenge intruders or report them to the police. Second, the sense of owned space creates an environment where &quot;strangers&quot; or &quot;intruders&quot; stand out and are more easily identified. Natural territorial reinforcement uses buildings, fences, pavement, signs, lighting, and landscape to express ownership and define public, semi-public, and private spaces. Additionally, these objectives can be achieved by assignment of space to designated users in previously unassigned locations.

*Maintained premises and landscaping to communicate an alert and active presence occupying the space.
*Provide trees in residential areas. Research results indicate that contrary to traditional views within the law enforcement community, outdoor residential spaces with more trees are seen as significantly more attractive, safer, and more likely to be used than similar spaces without trees.
*Restrict private activities to defined private areas.
*Display security system signage at access points.
*Avoid chain link fencing and razor-wire fence topping, as they communicate the absence of a physical presence and reduce the risk of being detected.
*Placing amenities such as seating or refreshments in common areas in a commercial or institutional setting helps to attract larger numbers of desired users.
*Scheduling activities in common areas increases proper use, attracts more people, and increases the perception that these areas are controlled.
*Motion sensor lights at all entry points into the residence.

Territorial reinforcement measures make the intended user feel safe and make the potential offender aware of a substantial risk of apprehension or scrutiny. When people take pride in what they own and take the proper measures to protect their belongings, crime is deterred from those areas because it makes it more of a challenge.

===Other CPTED elements===
Support and maintenance activities complement physical design elements. 

====Maintenance====
Maintenance is an expression of ownership of property. Deterioration indicates less control by a site&#x27;s intended users and a greater tolerance of disorder. The Broken Windows Theory is a valuable tool in understanding the importance of maintenance in deterring crime. Broken Windows theory proponents support a zero tolerance approach to property maintenance, observing that a broken window will entice vandals to break more nearby windows. The sooner broken windows are fixed, the less likely such vandalism will occur. Vandalism falls into the broken windows category as well. The faster the graffiti is painted over, the less likely one is to repeat it because no one saw what has been done. A positive image in the community shows a sense of pride and self-worth that no one can take away from the property owner.

====Activity support====
Activity support increases the use of a built environment for safe activities to increase the risk of detecting criminal and undesirable activities. Natural surveillance by the intended users is casual, and there is no specific plan for people to watch out for criminal activity. By placing signs cautioning children to play and signs for certain activities in the area, the citizens of that area will be more involved in what is happening around them. They will be more tuned in to who is and is not supposed to be there and what looks suspicious.

==Effectiveness and criticism==
CPTED strategies are most successful when they inconvenience the end user the least and when the CPTED design process relies upon the combined efforts of environmental designers, land managers, community activists, and law enforcement professionals. These strategies cannot be fulfilled without the community&#x27;s help, and they require the whole community in the location to make the environment safer. A meta-analysis of multiple-component CPTED initiatives in the United States has found that they have decreased robberies between 30% and 84% (Casteel and Peek-Asa, 2000).

In terms of effectiveness, a more accurate title for the strategy would be crime &quot;deterrence&quot; through environmental design. Research demonstrates that offenders might not always be prevented from committing some crimes by using CPTED. CPTED relies upon changes to the physical environment that will cause an offender to make certain behavioral decisions, and some of those decisions will include desisting from crime. Those changes deter rather than conclusively &quot;prevent&quot; behavior.

<doc id="1166037" wikidata="Q716620" url="?curid=1166037" title="Formosan clouded leopard">
<text>The Formosan clouded leopard is a clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;) population that was endemic to Taiwan. Camera trapping studies carried out in several protected areas in Taiwan between 1997 and 2012 did not record any clouded leopard. The population is listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis nebulosa&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Edward Griffith in 1821 who first described a skin of a clouded leopard that was brought alive from Guangdong in China to the menagerie at Exeter Exchange in London. &quot;Leopardus brachyurus&quot; was proposed by Robert Swinhoe in 1862 who described a skin of a clouded leopard from Formosa.

It was later considered the clouded leopard subspecies &quot;Neofelis nebulosa brachyurus&quot;. However, genetic analysis of hair samples of &quot;Neofelis&quot; specimens revealed that the Formosan clouded leopard is not distinct from the mainland clouded leopard. The Formosan clouded leopard is therefore currently not recognised as a distinct clouded leopard subspecies.

== Characteristics ==

It was first described in 1862 on the basis of a traded skin with an incomplete tail. Its fur colour is pale to tawny, and it has large cloud-like markings on the shoulders and flanks with a few spots within the clouds. In his first description of four Formosan clouded leopard skins, Swinhoe noted the shortness of its tail, which is about one-half the length of clouded leopard specimens from the Himalayas. Prior to its extirpation, it was Taiwan&#x27;s second-largest carnivore, after the Formosan black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus formosanus&quot;).

== Last efforts==

An interview survey conducted in 1986 among 70 indigenous Taiwanese hunters revealed that they sighted a Formosan clouded leopard in the Tawu Mountain area in 1983 for the last time. In 1989, the skin of a young individual was found in the Taroko National Park area, which is the last confirmed record. Pugmarks reported in the 1990s near Yushan National Park were suspected, but not confirmed to be of a clouded leopard.

It has been assumed that clouded leopards retreated into the Yushan Range and Tawu Mountain after extensive logging of natural habitat. Today, the Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve is a protected area encompassing about . It harbours the largest remaining primary forest in southern Taiwan and comprises tropical and subtropical rainforest as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and temperate coniferous forest.

Between 1997 and 2012, camera trapping surveys were conducted in more than 1,450 sites in potentially suitable habitats across Taiwan, from the seashore to an elevation of , in fragmented lowlands and inside protected areas. This survey also included 13,000 camera trap nights between 2000 and 2004 in Tawu Mountain Nature Reserve and the adjacent Twin Ghost Lake Important Wildlife Area. During a nationwide survey effort of 128,349 camera trap days, 12 potential prey species were recorded, including the sambar (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;), the Formosan serow (&quot;Capricornis swinhoei&quot;), Reeves&#x27;s muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus reevesi&quot;), the Formosan macaque (&quot;Macaca cyclopis&quot;) Swinhoe&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Lophura swinhoii&quot;) and rodents. However, not a single clouded leopard was recorded. It is therefore considered extirpated.
== Alleged sightings ==
In the summer of 2018, two different groups of rangers allegedly sighted a clouded leopard in Taitung County. One group claimed to have seen an individual climbing a tree and hunting goats on a cliff. The other group contended to have observed an individual darting past a scooter on a road and climbing into a tree.

== Cultural influence ==
The clouded leopard is highly respected by the Rukai people culture who believe that their ancestors followed a clouded leopard to their ancestral land. They consider the hunting of clouded leopards a taboo. In Paiwan culture, the pelt of clouded leopard can only be worn by the nobility.

In both cultures, it is believed that the clouded leopard and the Formosan black bear are originally white, until one day they decided to paint each other. The bear meticulously painted the leopard with exquisite patterns. The clouded leopard painted the bear all black, except for the V-shaped area before the chest, which remained white for various reasons depending on the version of the story. As an apology for the bad work, now the clouded leopards only eat a part of their prey, leaving the rest for the bear.

The Taoyuan Leopards professional basketball team&#x27;s name is inspired by the species.

<text>A cordon sanitaire (, French for &quot;sanitary cordon&quot;) is the restriction of movement of people into or out of a defined geographic area, such as a community, region, or country. The term originally denoted a barrier used to stop the spread of infectious diseases. The term is also often used metaphorically, in English, to refer to attempts to prevent the spread of an ideology deemed unwanted or dangerous, such as the containment policy adopted by George F. Kennan against the Soviet Union (see &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; in politics).
== Origin ==
The term &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; dates to 1821, when the Duke de Richelieu deployed French troops to the border between France and Spain, to prevent yellow fever from spreading into France.

==Definition==

A &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; is generally created around an area experiencing an epidemic or an outbreak of infectious disease, or along the border between two nations. Once the cordon is established, people from the affected area are no longer allowed to leave or enter it. In the most extreme form, the cordon is not lifted until the infection is extinguished. Traditionally, the line around a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was quite physical; a fence or wall was built, armed troops patrolled, and inside, inhabitants were left to battle the affliction without help. In some cases, a &quot;reverse &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;&quot; (also known as protective sequestration) may be imposed on healthy communities that are attempting to keep an infection from being introduced. Public health specialists have included &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; along with quarantine and medical isolation as &quot;nonpharmaceutical interventions&quot; designed to prevent the transmission of microbial pathogens through social distancing.

The &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; is not used now in its most extreme historical form, mainly due to our improved understanding of disease transmission, treatment and prevention. Today its function is primarily to facilitate the identification of infectious disease and to prevent its transmission. In its more traditional role, the &quot;cordon&quot; also remains a useful intervention under conditions in which: 1) the infection is highly virulent (contagious and likely to cause illness); 2) the case fatality rate is very high; 3) treatment is nonexistent or difficult; and 4) there is no vaccine, or other means of immunizing large numbers of people (such as needles or syringes) are lacking. During the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot; were imposed on geographic regions around the world in an attempt to contain the infection.

===16th century===
* In 1523, during a plague outbreak in Birgu, the town was cordoned off by guards to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of Malta.

===17th century===
* In 1655, &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was imposed on the town of Żabbar in Malta after a plague outbreak was detected. The disease spread to other settlements and similar restrictive measures were imposed, and the outbreak was successfully contained after causing 20 deaths.
* In May 1666, the English village of Eyam famously imposed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; on itself after an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the community. During the next 14 months almost eighty percent of the inhabitants died. A perimeter of stones was laid out surrounding the village and no one passed the boundary in either direction until November 1667, when the pestilence had run its course. Neighbouring communities provided food for Eyam, leaving supplies in designated locations along the boundary cordon and receiving payment in coins &quot;disinfected&quot; by running water or vinegar.

===18th century===
* During the Great Northern War plague outbreak of 1708–1712, &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot; were established around affected towns like Stralsund, Helsingør, and Königsberg; one was also established around the whole Duchy of Prussia and another one between Scania and the Danish isles along the Sound, with Saltholm as the central quarantine station.
* In 1770 the Empress Maria Theresa set up a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; between Austria and the Ottoman Empire to prevent people and goods infected with plague from crossing the border. Cotton and wool were held in storehouses for weeks, with peasants paid to sleep on the bales and monitored to see if they showed signs of disease. Travelers were quarantined for 21 days under ordinary circumstances and up to 48 days when there was confirmation of plague being active in Ottoman territory. The cordon was maintained until 1871, and there were no major outbreaks of plague in Austrian territory after the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was established, whereas the Ottoman Empire continued to suffer frequent epidemics of plague until the mid-19th century.
* During the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, roads and bridges leading to the city were blocked off by soldiers from the local militia to prevent the illness from spreading. This was before the transmission mechanics of yellow fever were well understood.

===19th century===
* During the 1813–1814 Malta plague epidemic, the main urban settlements of Malta (Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities) and rural settlements with a high mortality rate (Birkirkara, Qormi, Żebbuġ and later Xagħra) were cordoned off by the military to prevent people from entering or leaving.
* The first actual use of the term &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was in 1821, when the Duke de Richelieu deployed 30,000 French troops to the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains, allegedly in order to prevent yellow fever from spreading from Barcelona into France but in fact mainly to prevent the spread of liberal ideas from constitutional Spain.
* The 1821 yellow fever epidemic ravaged Barcelona and a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was set up around the entire city of 150,000 people. Between 18,000 and 20,000 died in four months.
* During the 1830 cholera outbreak in Russia, Moscow was surrounded by a military cordon, most roads leading to the city were dug up to hinder travel, and all but four entrances to the city were sealed.
* During the 1856 yellow fever epidemic a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was implemented in several cities in the state of Georgia with moderate success.
* In 1869, Adrien Proust (father of novelist Marcel Proust) proposed the use of an international &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; to control the spread of cholera, which had emerged from India and was threatening Europe and Africa. Proust proposed that all ships bound for Europe from India and Southeast Asia be quarantined at Suez, however his ideas were not generally embraced.
* In 1882, in response to a virulent outbreak of yellow fever in Brownsville, Texas, and in northern Mexico, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was established 180 miles north of the city, terminating at the Rio Grande to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. People traveling north had to remain quarantined at the cordon for 10 days before they were certified disease-free and could proceed.
* In 1888, during a yellow fever epidemic, the city of Jacksonville, Florida, was surrounded by an armed &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; by order of Governor Edward A. Perry.
* In 1899, an outbreak of the plague in Honolulu was managed by a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around the Chinatown district. In an attempt to control the infection, a barbed wire perimeter was created and people&#x27;s belongings and homes were burned.

===20th century===
* During the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904 San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown was subjected to a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;.
* In 1902, Louisiana imposed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; to prevent Italian immigrants from disembarking at the port of New Orleans. The shipping company sued for damages, but the state&#x27;s right to impose a cordon was upheld in &quot;Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. Louisiana Board of Health&quot;.
* From 1903 to 1914, the Belgian colonial government imposed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; on Uele Province in the Belgian Congo to control outbreaks of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).
* 1918 flu pandemic:
** The 1918 flu spread so rapidly that, in general, there was no time to implement &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot;. However, to prevent an introduction of the infection, residents of Gunnison, Colorado isolated themselves from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of this protective sequestration, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.
** During the 1918 flu pandemic, the then Governor of American Samoa, John Martin Poyer, imposed a reverse &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of the islands from all incoming ships, successfully achieving zero deaths within the territory. In contrast, the neighboring New Zealand-controlled Western Samoa was among the hardest hit, with a 90% infection rate and over 20% of its adults dying from the disease.
** In late 1918, Spain attempted unsuccessfully to prevent the spread of the 1918 flu by imposing border controls, roadblocks, restricted rail travel, and a maritime &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; prohibiting ships with sick passengers from landing, but by then the epidemic was already in progress.
* During the 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak, over 10,000 people were sequestered in &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot; of villages and neighborhoods using roadblocks, and there was a general prohibition of public assembly, a closure of all borders and a prohibition of all non-essential travel.
* In 1995, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was used to control an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Zaire. President Mobutu Sese Seko surrounded the town with troops and suspended all flights into the community. Inside Kikwit, the World Health Organization and Zaire medical teams erected further &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot;, isolating burial and treatment zones from the general population.

===21st century===
* During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada, &quot;community quarantine&quot; was used to successfully reduce transmission of the disease.
* During the 2003 SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, large-scale quarantine was imposed on travelers arriving from other SARS areas, work and school contacts of suspected cases, and, in a few instances, entire apartment complexes where high attack rates of SARS were occurring. In China, entire villages in rural areas were quarantined and no travel was allowed in or out of the villages. One village in Hebei province was quarantined from 12 April 2003 until 13 May. Tens of thousands of individuals fled from areas when they learned of an impending &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, thereby possibly spreading the epidemic.
* In August 2014, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was established around some of the most affected areas of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic. On 19 August 2014, the Liberian government quarantined the entirety of the district of West Point of the capital, Monrovia, and issued a statewide curfew. The &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of the West Point area was lifted on 30 August. The information minister, Lewis Brown, said that this step was taken to ease efforts to screen, test, and treat residents.
* In January 2020, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was drawn around the Chinese city of Wuhan, known as the Wuhan lockdown, due to what became the COVID-19 pandemic. As the outbreak expanded, travel restrictions impacted over half of the Chinese population, creating what may be the largest &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; in history until this was surpassed by the lockdown in India, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population, in March 2020. By April 2020, half of the world&#x27;s population was under some form of lockdown in more than 90 countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the 2020–2021 Malaysian movement control order and a nationwide lockdown in Italy.

== Ethical considerations ==

Guidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in the Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights and adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1984. The Siracusa Principles state that restrictions on human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must meet standards of legality, evidence-based necessity, proportionality, and gradualism, noting that public health can be used as grounds for limiting certain rights if the state needs to take measures &quot;aimed at preventing disease or injury or providing care for the sick and injured.&quot; Limitations on rights (such as a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;) must be &quot;strictly necessary,&quot; meaning that they must:
* respond to a pressing public or social need (health)
* proportionately pursue a legitimate aim (prevent the spread of infectious disease)
* be the least restrictive means required for achieving the purpose of the limitation
* be provided for and carried out in accordance with the law
* be neither arbitrary nor discriminatory
* only limit rights that are within the jurisdiction of the state seeking to impose the limitation.

In addition, when a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; is imposed, public health ethics specify that:
* all restrictive actions must be well-supported by data and scientific evidence
* all information must be made available to the public
* all actions must be explained clearly to those whose rights are restricted and to the public
* all actions must be subject to regular review and reconsideration.

Finally, the state is ethically obligated to guarantee that:
* infected people will not be threatened or abused
* basic needs such as food, water, medical care, and preventive care will be provided
* communication with loved ones and with caretakers will be permitted
* constraints on freedom will be applied equally, regardless of social considerations
* those who are affected will be compensated fairly for economic and material losses, including salary.

==In popular culture==
* A &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was used as a plot device by Albert Camus in his 1947 novel &quot;The Plague&quot;.

<text>The Metropolitan District Railway, also known as the District Railway, was a passenger railway that served London, England, from 1868 to 1933. Established in 1864 to complete an &quot;inner circle&quot; of lines connecting railway termini in London, the first part of the line opened using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The Metropolitan Railway operated all services until the District Railway introduced its own trains in 1871. The railway was soon extended westwards through Earl&#x27;s Court to Fulham, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow. After completing the inner circle and reaching Whitechapel in 1884, it was extended to Upminster in Essex in 1902.

To finance electrification at the beginning of the 20th century, American financier Charles Yerkes took it over and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) group. Electric propulsion was introduced in 1905, and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services. On 1 July 1933, the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital&#x27;s tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board.

Today, former District Railway tracks and stations are used by the London Underground&#x27;s District, Piccadilly and Circle lines.
==History==

===Origins, 1863–1886===

====Inner Circle====
In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) opened the world&#x27;s first underground railway. The line was built from Paddington beneath the New Road, connecting the main line railway termini at , and King&#x27;s Cross. Then it followed Farringdon Road to a station at Farringdon Street in Smithfield, near the capital&#x27;s financial heart in the City.

The Met&#x27;s early success prompted a flurry of applications to Parliament in 1863 for new railways in London, many competing for similar routes. The House of Lords established a select committee that recommended an &quot;inner circuit of railway that should abut, if not actually join, nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis&quot;. For the 1864 parliamentary session, railway schemes were presented that met the recommendation in varying ways and a joint committee composed of members of both Houses of Parliament reviewed the options.
Proposals to extend west and then south from Paddington to South Kensington and east from Moorgate to Tower Hill were accepted and received royal assent on 29 July 1864 in the Metropolitan Railway (Notting Hill and Brompton Extension) Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. ccxci) and the Metropolitan Railway (Tower Hill Extension) Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cccxv) respectively. To complete the circuit, the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two other schemes proposed to run via different routes between Kensington and the City and a combined proposal under the name &quot;Metropolitan District Railway&quot; passed into law on the same day in the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cccxxii). Initially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would soon merge. The Met&#x27;s chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.

Unlike the Metropolitan, the route did not follow an easy alignment under existing roads and land values were higher, so compensation payments for property were much higher. Major landowners, including Lord Kensington, sold parcels of land to the railway company. To ensure ventilation, the line west of Gloucester Road was carried in open cuttings, the rest mainly in a cut and cover tunnel wide and deep; at the stations the platform ends were left open. Construction costs and compensation payments were so high that the cost of the first section of the District from South Kensington to Westminster was £3 million, almost three times the cost of the Met&#x27;s original, longer line. On 24 December 1868, the District opened its line from South Kensington to Westminster, with stations at South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St James&#x27;s Park and Westminster Bridge (now Westminster), the Met extending eastwards from Brompton to a shared station at South Kensington on the same day.

The District also had parliamentary permission to extend westward from Brompton (Gloucester Road) station and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single track line from there to West Brompton on the West London Railway. There were no intermediate stations and this service initially operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 additional tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton (Gloucester Road) and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell Curve connecting Brompton (Gloucester Road) and Kensington (High Street). East of Westminster, the next section ran in the newly constructed Victoria Embankment built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line was opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with stations at Charing Cross (now Embankment), The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars.
The Met initially operated all services, receiving 55 per cent of the gross receipts for a fixed level of service. The District were also charged for any extra trains and the District&#x27;s share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent. The District&#x27;s level of debt meant that merger was no longer attractive to the Met and its directors resigned from the District&#x27;s board. To improve its finances, the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement. Struggling under the burden of high construction costs, the District was unable to continue with the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line one station further east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at Mansion House.

On Saturday 1 July 1871, an opening banquet was attended by prime minister William Gladstone, who was also a shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. From this date, the two companies operated a joint &quot;inner circle&quot; service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran every ten minutes. This was supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton, and Hammersmith &amp; City Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. At the other end of the line, the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl&#x27;s Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871.

====West to Putney Bridge, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow====
The District Railway&#x27;s main expansion was to the west. A small station at Earl&#x27;s Court, between Gloucester Road and West Brompton, opened on 31 October 1871 with three platforms. Lillie Bridge depot, opened in 1872, was built parallel to the West London Joint Railway and initially accessed by a curve onto the West London Line. This curve allowed, from 1 February 1872, the London &amp; North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR) to run a half-hourly &quot;outer circle&quot; service from Broad Street to Mansion House via , Addison Road and Earls Court. From 1 October 1872, the GWR also ran a half-hourly &quot;middle circle&quot; service from the Met&#x27;s Moorgate Street station to Mansion House via Paddington and Earl&#x27;s Court.

Permission to build a railway long to Hammersmith was granted on 7 July 1873, the independent Hammersmith Extension Railway having been formed to raise the necessary capital. The new line started from a junction on the curve to Addison Road and also allowed easier access to Lillie Bridge Depot. It opened on 9 September 1874 with one intermediate station at North End (Fulham) (renamed West Kensington in 1877) and a terminus at Hammersmith, and was served by through trains to Mansion House. West Brompton was now served by a shuttle to Earl&#x27;s Court. Earl&#x27;s Court station burnt down in 1875 and a larger replacement with four tracks and two island platforms opened on 1 February 1878. This was sited to the west of the original station; to the east of the station a flying junction was built to separate traffic to Kensington (High Street) and from Gloucester Road.

In December 1876, six trains per hour ran on the &quot;inner circle&quot; between Mansion House and Aldgate. The District operated four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith. Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR &quot;middle circle&quot; services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L&amp;NWR services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction. Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl&#x27;s Court.

In 1864 the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) had obtained permission for the Kensington and Richmond line. The route headed north from Addison Road on the West London Railway before curving round to serve Hammersmith at a station at (linked to the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway station by footbridge), Turnham Green, Brentford Road (Gunnersbury from 1871) and Kew Gardens and Richmond. The line opened on 1 January 1869, the L&amp;SWR running services from Waterloo and Ludgate Hill via Addison Road, and the L&amp;NWR running services from Broad Street to Richmond from a link at Brentford Road to the North London Line at South Acton. Stations opened on the line at Shaftesbury Road (Ravenscourt Park from 1888) and Shepherds Bush on 1 May 1874.

In 1875 permission was given for a link from the District station at Hammersmith to a junction just east of Ravenscourt Park. As the L&amp;SWR line was on a viaduct and the District line in a cutting, the line rose steeply. On 1 June 1877, the Hammersmith branch was extended to Richmond, initially with a service of one train an hour to Mansion House. The Met and GWR Hammersmith &amp; City line had access by a link just north of their Hammersmith station and diverted a service to Richmond from 1 October 1877.

From 1 May 1878 to 30 September 1880, the Midland Railway operated a circular service from to Earl&#x27;s Court via Dudding Hill, Acton and the L&amp;SWR to Hammersmith. In 1879 the District opened a junction west of L&amp;SWR&#x27;s Turnham Green station for a line to Ealing. With stations at Acton Green (now Chiswick Park), Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town), Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway, the Ealing station was built just north of the GWR station. On 4 July 1878, permission was granted to extend the West Brompton branch as far as the Thames. Stations opened at Walham Green (now Fulham Broadway), Parsons Green. The line terminated at Putney Bridge &amp; Fulham (now Putney Bridge). The line opened on 1 March 1880, in time for the University Boat Race held that year on 22 March. Initially the service was two trains an hour to Mansion House, supplemented from 1 April by two trains an hour to High Street Kensington.

In 1866, permission had been granted to landowners in the Hounslow area for a &quot;Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway&quot; to connect to a proposed Acton &amp; Brentford Railway. However, this had never been built, but with the District now at Acton there was an alternative. Permission was granted in 1880 for a nearly railway from Mill Hill Park station to Hounslow Barracks, with stations at South Ealing, Boston Road and Spring Grove, and agreement reached for the District to work the line. On 1 May 1883 the District started a service to Hounslow Town, calling at South Ealing, Boston Road (now Boston Manor) and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove (replaced by Osterley). A single-track line from junction near Hounslow Town to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West) opened a year later in 1884. Traffic was light and Hounslow Barracks was initially served by a shuttle to Osterley &amp; Spring Grove that connected to an off-peak Hounslow Town to Mill Hill Park train. Hounslow Town station closed in 1886 and Heston Hounslow station (now Hounslow Central) opened.

From 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885, via a connection to the GWR tracks at Ealing, the District ran a service to Windsor.

===Expansion, 1874–1900===

====Completing the circle====

Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed the completion of the &quot;inner circle&quot;. In 1874, frustrated City financiers formed the &quot;Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway Company&quot; with the aim of finishing the route. The company was supported by the District railway and obtained parliamentary authority on 7 August 1874, but struggled with funding. The time allowed was extended in 1876. A meeting between the District and Metropolitan was held in 1877, the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway (SER) via the East London Railway (ELR). Both companies promoted and obtained an act of Parliament, the Metropolitan and District Railways (City Lines and Extensions) Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. cci), for the extension and a link to the ELR. The act also ensured future co-operation by allowing both companies access to the whole circle. A large contribution was made by authorities for road and sewer improvements. In 1882 the Met extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower of London. Two contracts to build joint lines were placed, one from Mansion House to the Tower in 1882 and a second from the circle north of Aldgate to Whitechapel with a curve onto the ELR in 1883. From 1 October 1884 the District and Metropolitan began local services from St Mary&#x27;s via this curve onto the East London Railway to SER&#x27;s New Cross station. After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running, a circular service started on Monday 6 October 1884. On the same day the District extended its services to Whitechapel and over the ELR to New Cross, calling at new joint stations at Aldgate East and St Mary&#x27;s. Joint stations opened on the circle line at Cannon Street, Eastcheap (Monument from 1 November 1884) and Mark Lane. The Met&#x27;s Tower of London station closed on 12 October 1884 after the District refused to sell tickets to the station. After opening the District service from New Cross four trains an hour ran alternately to Hammersmith or Putney, but as passenger demand was low after a month this was reduced to two trains an hour to Ealing. Four trains an hour went from Whitechapel, two to Putney, one to Hammersmith and one to Richmond. The middle and outer circle services continued operating from Mansion House at two per hour each. Initially the &quot;inner circle&quot; service was eight trains an hour, completing the circuit in 81–84 minutes, but this proved impossible to maintain and service was reduced to six trains an hour with a 70-minute timing in 1885. Initially guards were permitted no relief breaks during their shift until September 1885 when they were permitted three 20-minute breaks.

====South to Wimbledon====
Several schemes to cross the Thames at Putney Bridge to Guildford, Surbiton or Wimbledon had been proposed and received approval from Parliament, although the District had been unable to raise the necessary funding. In 1886 the L&amp;SWR replaced these plans with the Wimbledon and Fulham Railway that started on the west side of Wimbledon and crossing Thames to meet the District&#x27;s Putney Bridge station. The line had intermediate stations at Wimbledon Park, Southfields and East Putney and a junction connected the line to the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s Waterloo to Reading Line just north of East Putney station. The District had running rights and extended some Putney services to Wimbledon on 3 June 1889.

===East to East Ham===
In 1897 the nominally independent Whitechapel and Bow Railway received permission for a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) at an above-ground junction at Bow, to the west of Bromley station. The LT&amp;SR and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The &quot;outer circle&quot; continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR&#x27;s &quot;middle circle&quot; having started at Earl&#x27;s Court from 1900.

===Uxbridge===
The District sought to serve Harrow and Uxbridge and in 1892 a route from Ealing to Roxeth (South Harrow) was surveyed and a bill presented in the name of the nominally independent Ealing and South Harrow Railway (E&amp;SHR), becoming law as the (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. ccxv). Construction started in 1897 and by the end of 1899 it was largely complete, but with low traffic prospects remained unopened. To reach Uxbridge a line from South Harrow via Ruislip was authorised in 1897. The District had problems raising the finance and the Metropolitan offered a rescue package whereby they would build a branch from Harrow to Rayners Lane and take over the line to Uxbridge, with the District retaining running rights for up to three trains an hour. The Metropolitan built the railway to Uxbridge and began running services on 4 July 1904.

===Electrification, 1900–1906===

====Development====
At the start of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan railways faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City and South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the &quot;inner circle&quot;. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl&#x27;s Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.

The District found an investor to finance the upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1 million to carry out the electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.

The District had permission for a deep-level tube beneath the sub-surface line between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House and in 1898 bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway with authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. These plans were combined with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway, a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Wood Green, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The section of the District&#x27;s deep-level tube from South Kensington to Mansion house was dropped from plans. In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the Traction Company and paid off the company&#x27;s shareholders with cash and UERL shares.

The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District lines and the underground lines planned. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity at 11 kV Hz, conveyed by high voltage cables to substations that converted this to approximately 550V DC.

While the power station was being built, the District electrified the Ealing to Harrow line that was not yet open. It was equipped with automatic signalling using track circuits and pneumatic semaphore signals, and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town).

After the trials, the line to South Harrow opened in June 1903, from 23 June with a shuttle to Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey (now Park Royal) for that year&#x27;s Royal Agricultural Show. The rest of the line to South Harrow opened the following week on 28 June, with stations at North Ealing, Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey, Perivale-Alperton (now Alperton), Sudbury Town, Sudbury Hill and South Harrow.

====Electric services====

Electric services began on 13 June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton, using the line from Mill Hill Park to South Acton for a passenger service for the first time. Hounslow Town station was reopened, trains reversing at the station before continuing to Hounslow Barracks using a new single track curve. On 1 July 1905 electric trains began running from Ealing to Whitechapel, and on the same day the Metropolitan and District railways both introduced electric units on the &quot;inner circle.&quot; However, a Metropolitan multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District Railway, and investigation showed an incompatibility between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District Railway track, and the Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines. After modification the Met returned and electric trains took over on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from seventy to fifty minutes. By September, after withdrawing services over the unelectrified East London Line and the east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. From December 1905 the L&amp;NWR service was hauled by electric locomotives from Mansion House to Earl&#x27;s Court, where a L&amp;NWR steam locomotive took over.

In 1907 the weekday off-peak service was four trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway, four per hour from Mansion House to alternately Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel. Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl&#x27;s Court, two continuing to High Street Kensington. From South Harrow there were two trains per hour to Mill Hill Park, and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park, two of these continuing to South Acton.

Meanwhile, the UERL&#x27;s GNP&amp;BR tube railway was under construction, surfacing west of West Kensington and entering two terminal platforms on the north side of the District&#x27;s Hammersmith station. A new station, Barons Court, was built with two island platforms, one for each railway. As there was space at Lillie Bridge Depot after the District had moved to Mill Hill Park, the GNP&amp;BR took over part of the site for its depot. Barons Court opened 9 October 1905 and the tube railway opened as the Piccadilly line on 15 December 1906.

===London Underground, 1908–1933===

====Running an electric railway====
In 1908 the UERL and the other underground railway companies in London came to a joint marketing arrangement that included maps, joint publicity and combined ticketing. UD signs were used outside stations in Central London. The UERL eventually controlled all underground railways in London except the Waterloo &amp; City Railway, the Metropolitan Railway and its subsidiary the Great Northern &amp; City Railway, and introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar.

&#x27;Non-stop&#x27; working was introduced on the District in December 1907. Usually just a few stations were missed; trains were marked NON STOP or ALL STATIONS as appropriate and panels beside the doors listed the stations the train would skip. East of Bow Road station the District shared the tracks with steam engines and widening the railway to East Ham was considered essential. Four tracks were laid and two electrified as far as Barking, where the Tilbury and Upminster routes separated. On 1 April 1908 District trains were extended through to Barking and the work was largely finished in July 1908. After 2 May 1909 trains no longer reversed at Hounslow Town after the station was closed and a new Hounslow Town station opened on the direct route.

Since 1904, after the District had notified the Met that it would not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although it paid the £2,000 a year that was due under the enabling act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910.

Between Turnham Green and Ravenscourt Park the District shared tracks with L&amp;SWR steam trains to Richmond, a GWR steam service from Richmond to Ladbroke Grove and Midland coal trains. The District and L&amp;SWR agreed to quadruple the tracks to allow a pair for the District&#x27;s sole use and build a station on the District tracks at Stamford Brook. The line was first used on 3 December 1911 and Stamford Brook opened on 1 February 1912. However, the GWR had already withdrawn their service and L&amp;SWR was to withdraw in 1916. A flying junction separating the Richmond and Hammersmith routes west of Earl&#x27;s Court opened in January 1914.

From 1910 to 1939 the ran through trains between Ealing Broadway and Southend or Shoeburyness, hauled west of Barking by the District&#x27;s electric locomotives that were no longer needed for the L&amp;NWR&#x27;s outer circle service, and east of Barking by steam locomotive. From 1912 two specially built sets of saloon coaches with retention toilets were used. In the 1920s the off-peak weekday service was a train every ten minutes from Wimbledon and Ealing and every fifteen minutes from Richmond. Six trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to High Street Kensington. Trains from Hounslow left every 6–8 minutes, terminating at Acton Town or South Acton. Six trains per hour left Hammersmith for South Harrow, three continuing to Uxbridge. In 1925 the &quot;inner circle&quot; service was ten trains per hour in each direction, but this frequency of service caused problems. A reduction to eight would leave the Kensington High Street to Edgware Road section with too few trains. However the Metropolitan had recently rebuilt it with four platforms as part of an abandoned plan for a tube to Kilburn. The District extended its Putney to High Street service to Edgware Road and the Metropolitan provided all &quot;inner circle&quot; trains at a frequency of eight trains per hour.

In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway had inherited the line to Barking, and in 1929 proposed quadrupling the line to Upminster and electrifying one pair of tracks for use by the District. On 12 September 1932 services started with new stations at Upney and Heathway (now Dagenham Heathway) with platforms only on the District tracks.

====Piccadilly line extension====

In November 1912 a bill was published that included a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s Richmond branch tracks. The bill passed as the London Electric Railway Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. xcvii) on 15 August 1913, although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension.

Powers were renewed in 1926 for the quadruple track from Hammersmith to be extended to west of Acton Town, with the concept of the Piccadilly running non-stop on the inner pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.

With finance guaranteed by the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 7), construction started in 1930. Two additional tracks were built from west of Turnham Green to Northfields on the Hounslow branch. East of Turnham Green a freight loop was built for eastbound coal trains from Richmond to Kensington. Acton Town was rebuilt with five platforms, and a depot was built west of Northfields station.

Several stations were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who was inspired by examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe. This influence can be seen in the bold vertical and horizontal forms, which were combined with the use of traditional materials like brick. Holden called them &#x27;brick boxes with concrete lids&#x27;. Today, several of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II*.

On 4 July 1932 the District service from Acton Town to South Harrow was withdrawn and one in three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields, continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933. District trains continued to run through to Hounslow off-peak, with a shuttle from South Acton.

===London Passenger Transport Board, 1933===
The UERL&#x27;s ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the group.

To protect the UERL group&#x27;s income, its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take control of the LCC&#x27;s tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1933. On this date, ownership of the assets of the District and the other Underground companies transferred to the LPTB.

===Legacy===
The railway became the District line of London Transport. From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service replaced the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) had taken over the L&amp;NWR railway&#x27;s outer circle service from Earl&#x27;s Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an electrified Earl&#x27;s Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended. After the war, to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl&#x27;s Court to Addison Road, now renamed Kensington Olympia.

The off-peak District Hounslow branch shuttle to South Acton was discontinued on 29 April 1935 and replaced by an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle. This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, and the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964. In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport, first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened. Later on 27 March 2008, the branch was extended to Heathrow Terminal 5.
==Rolling stock==

===Steam locomotives===
When in 1871 the District Railway needed its own locomotives, they ordered twenty four condensing steam locomotives from Beyer Peacock similar to the A Class locomotives the Metropolitan Railway was using on the route. As they were intended for an underground railway, the locomotives did not have cabs, but had a weatherboard with a bent-back top. The back plate of the bunker was raised to provide protection when running bunker first. A total of fifty four locomotives were purchased. They were still in service in 1905 when the line was electrified, and all but six were sold the following year.

===Electric locomotives===

In 1905 the District bought ten bogie box cab locomotives that looked similar to their multiple units but were only long. They were manufactured by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company and most had a single cab at one end. Consequently, they were operated in pairs, coupled back to back with the cabs at the outer end.

The locomotives were used to haul L&amp;NWR passenger trains on the electrified section of the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; route between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. After December 1908 these services terminated at Earl&#x27;s Court. The locomotives were used to haul District trains, one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars. From 1910 the locomotives were used on London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) trains extended over the District line, west of Barking. (Steam locomotives were used east of Barking.) 

===Carriages===
The steam carriages were four wheeled, long over the buffers. First, second and third class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof, later by a pressurised oil gas system. At first they were fitted with a chain brake. This was replaced by the simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake.

Initially trains were made up of eight carriages, but after 1879 nine became the standard. At the end of 1905 the District replaced 395 carriages with electric multiple units. A preserved carriage at the Kent and East Sussex Railway was thought to be a District Railway first class, but now thought likely to be a cutdown Metropolitan Railway eight wheeler.

===Electric multiple units===

In 1903 the District tested two seven-car trains with different control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access to the car was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand-operated sliding doors on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.

The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car electric trains in 1903. A third of the vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with an equal number of motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side.

In 1923 fifty motor car bodies were ordered to allow some of the original 1904–05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified &#x27;local stock&#x27; worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.

In 1932 the line to Upminster was electrified and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors to most of the District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.

 a driving motor car built in 1923 is a static exhibit at London Transport Museum at Covent Garden.

<text>The Championship Cup (known as the Northern Rail Cup for sponsorship reasons), previously known as the National League Cup, was a rugby league football competition for clubs in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Rugby League Championships. Although the French club Toulouse Olympique competed in the Championship from 2009 through 2011, they never participated in the cup until 2012 after they had left the Championship. The Cup&#x27;s last season was 2013, after which it was replaced by the 1895 Cup.

==History==
The Trans-Pennine Cup was a short-lived competition for professional British rugby league clubs outside Super League. It was played for during the period in which all non-Super League professional clubs were grouped into a single competition, the Northern Ford Premiership.

As part of the redevelopment of the Northern Ford Premiership competition; the National League cup was first held in 2002. It was known as the Buddies Cup, after its sponsor, a soft drinks manufacturer. Eighteen teams took part divided into three groups of six (East, West and Central).

The Northern Ford Premiership was replaced by National Leagues One and Two in 2003. The competition was known as the Arriva Trains Cup after sponsor Arriva Trains Northern). The twenty National League teams were divided into four groups (North, East, West and Central) of five teams each, while in 2004 there were five groups (North, East, West, Pennine, Yorkshire) of four teams each.

Northern Rail became the competition&#x27;s sponsor in 2005 and the name Northern Rail Cup was adopted. Four teams from the then National League Three also entered the competition. There were no cross-group games in the 2005 competition; each team therefore played only six games in the group stages, with the top team from each of the first five groups progressing to the quarter-final directly. The second-placed team in each of these groups, plus the top team from group six (the group of teams from National League 3) played an additional round to determine the remaining three spots in the quarter-finals.

For 2006 there were seven groups. Groups one to six comprised the 22 teams in National Leagues One and Two and the two southern National League Three teams, Hemel Stags and St Albans Centurions. There were four teams in each regional division. The top two teams from groups one to six and the best three third-placed teams qualified for the last sixteen knock out stage along with the winner of group seven. Group seven comprised northern National League Three teams that choose to enter, and included three teams: Bramley Buffaloes, Warrington Wizards and Dewsbury Celtic.

In 2007, it was announced that the competition would adopt a new points system: Win – three points; Draw – two points; Loss by 12 points or fewer – one point. However, in the group tables only one point was given for a draw.

In 2009, the Northern Rail Nines tournament was started. Teams not involved in the Northern Rail Cup Final entered a rugby league nines event with the trophy and plate final played as curtain raisers to the Northern Rail Cup Final at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool.

<doc id="1166049" wikidata="Q871335" url="?curid=1166049" title="Quenching">
<text>In materials science, quenching is the rapid cooling of a workpiece in water, gas, oil, polymer, air, or other fluids to obtain certain material properties. A type of heat treating, quenching prevents undesired low-temperature processes, such as phase transformations, from occurring. It does this by reducing the window of time during which these undesired reactions are both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible; for instance, quenching can reduce the crystal grain size of both metallic and plastic materials, increasing their hardness.

In metallurgy, quenching is most commonly used to harden steel by inducing a martensite transformation, where the steel must be rapidly cooled through its eutectoid point, the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable. Rapid cooling prevents the formation of cementite structure, instead forcibly dissolving carbon atoms in the ferrite lattice. In steel alloyed with metals such as nickel and manganese, the eutectoid temperature becomes much lower, but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same. This allows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much easier. High-speed steel also has added tungsten, which serves to raise kinetic barriers, which, among other effects, gives material properties (hardness and abrasion resistance) as though the workpiece had been cooled more rapidly than it really has. Even cooling such alloys slowly in the air has most of the desired effects of quenching; high-speed steel weakens much less from heat cycling due to high-speed cutting.

Extremely rapid cooling can prevent the formation of all crystal structures, resulting in amorphous metal or &quot;metallic glass&quot;.

==Quench hardening==
Quench hardening is a mechanical process in which steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened. These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or through-hardening varying on the rate at which the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the quench hardening process. Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks.

=== Purpose ===
Before hardening, cast steels and iron are of a uniform and lamellar (or layered) pearlitic grain structure. This is a mixture of ferrite and cementite formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate. Pearlite is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft. By heating pearlite past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 °C and then rapidly cooling, some of the material&#x27;s crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite. Steels with this martensitic structure are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation, such as the cutting edge of blades. This is very efficient. 

===Process===
The process of quenching is a progression, beginning with heating the sample. Most materials are heated to between , with careful attention paid to keeping temperatures throughout the workpiece uniform. Minimizing uneven heating and overheating is key to imparting desired material properties.

The second step in the quenching process is soaking. Workpieces can be soaked in air (air furnace), a liquid bath, or a vacuum. The recommended time allocation in salt or lead baths is up to 6 minutes. Soaking times can range a little higher within a vacuum. As in the heating step, it is important that the temperature throughout the sample remains as uniform as possible during soaking.

Once the workpiece has finished soaking, it moves on to the cooling step. During this step, the part is submerged into some kind of quenching fluid; different quenching fluids can have a significant effect on the final characteristics of a quenched part. Water is one of the most efficient quenching media where maximum hardness is desired, but there is a small chance that it may cause distortion and tiny cracking. When hardness can be sacrificed, mineral oils are often used. These oil-based fluids often oxidize and form sludge during quenching, which consequently lowers the efficiency of the process. The cooling rate of oil is much less than water. Intermediate rates between water and oil can be obtained with a purpose-formulated quenchant, a substance with an inverse solubility that therefore deposits on the object to slow the rate of cooling.

Quenching can also be accomplished using inert gases, such as nitrogen and noble gases. Nitrogen is commonly used at greater than atmospheric pressure ranging up to 20 bar absolute. Helium is also used because its thermal capacity is greater than nitrogen. Alternatively, argon can be used; however, its density requires significantly more energy to move, and its thermal capacity is less than the alternatives. To minimize distortion in the workpiece, long cylindrical workpieces are quenched vertically; flat workpieces are quenched on the edge; and thick sections should enter the bath first. To prevent steam bubbles the bath is agitated.

Often, after quenching, an iron or steel alloy will be excessively hard and brittle due to an overabundance of martensite. In these cases, another heat treatment technique known as tempering is performed on the quenched material to increase the toughness of iron-based alloys. Tempering is usually performed after hardening, to reduce some of the excess hardness, and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time, then allowing it to cool in still air.

===Mechanism of heat removal during quenching===
Heat is removed in three particular stages:

Stage A: Vapor bubbles formed over metal and starts cooling

During this stage, due to the Leidenfrost effect, the object is fully surrounded by vapor which insulates it from the rest of the liquid.

Stage B: Vapor-transport cooling

Once the temperature has dropped enough, the vapor layer will destabilize and the liquid will be able to fully contact the object and heat will be removed much more quickly.

Stage C: Liquid cooling

This stage occurs when the temperature of the object is below the boiling point of the liquid.

== History ==
There is evidence of the use of quenching processes by blacksmiths stretching back into the middle of the Iron Age, but little detailed information exists related to the development of these techniques and the procedures employed by early smiths. Although early ironworkers must have swiftly noticed that processes of cooling could affect the strength and brittleness of iron, and it can be claimed that heat treatment of steel was known in the Old World from the late second millennium BC, it is hard to identify deliberate uses of quenching archaeologically. Moreover, it appears that, at least in Europe, &quot;quenching and tempering separately do not seem to have become common until the 15th century&quot;; it is helpful to distinguish between &quot;full quenching&quot; of steel, where the quenching is so rapid that only martensite forms, and &quot;slack quenching&quot;, where the quenching is slower or interrupted, which also allows pearlite to form and results in a less brittle product.

The earliest examples of quenched steel may come from ancient Mesopotamia, with a relatively secure example of a fourth-century BC quench-hardened chisel from Al Mina in Turkey. Book 9, lines 389-94 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; is widely cited as an early, possibly the first, written reference to quenching:
as when a man who works as a blacksmith plunges a screaming great axe blade or adze into cold water, treating it for temper, since this is the way steel is made strong, even so Cyclops&#x27; eye sizzled about the beam of the olive.
However, it is not beyond doubt that the passage describes deliberate quench-hardening, rather than simply cooling. Likewise, there is a prospect that the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; refers to the oil-quenching of iron arrowheads, but the evidence is problematic.

Pliny the Elder addressed the topic of quenchants, distinguishing the water of different rivers. Chapters 18-21 of the twelfth-century &quot;De diversis artis&quot; by Theophilus Presbyter mentions quenching, recommending amongst other things that &#x27;tools are also given a harder tempering in the urine of a small, red-headed boy than in ordinary water&#x27;. One of the fuller early discussions of quenching is the first Western printed book on metallurgy, &quot;Von Stahel und Eysen&quot;, published in 1532, which is characteristic of late-medieval technical treatises.

The modern scientific study of quenching began to gain real momentum from the seventeenth century, with a major step being the observation-led discussion by Giambattista della Porta in his 1558 &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot;.

<text>A Boltzmann machine (also called Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model with external field or stochastic Ising model), named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a spin-glass model with an external field, i.e., a Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model, that is a stochastic Ising model. It is a statistical physics technique applied in the context of cognitive science. It is also classified as a Markov random field.

Boltzmann machines are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm (being trained by Hebb&#x27;s rule), and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not been proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.

They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics, which is used in their sampling function. They were heavily popularized and promoted by Geoffrey Hinton, Terry Sejnowski and Yann LeCun in cognitive sciences communities, particularly in machine learning, as part of &quot;energy-based models&quot; (EBM), because Hamiltonians of spin glasses as energy are used as a starting point to define the learning task.

==Structure==
A Boltzmann machine, like a Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model, is a network of units with a total &quot;energy&quot; (Hamiltonian) defined for the overall network. Its units produce binary results. Boltzmann machine weights are stochastic. The global energy formula_1 in a Boltzmann machine is identical in form to that of Hopfield networks and Ising models:

:formula_2

Where:
* formula_3 is the connection strength between unit formula_4 and unit formula_5.
* formula_6 is the state, formula_7, of unit formula_5.
* formula_9 is the bias of unit formula_5 in the global energy function. (formula_11 is the activation threshold for the unit.)

Often the weights formula_3 are represented as a symmetric matrix formula_13 with zeros along the diagonal.

==Unit state probability==
The difference in the global energy that results from a single unit formula_5 equaling 0 (off) versus 1 (on), written formula_15, assuming a symmetric matrix of weights, is given by:

:formula_16

Substituting the energy of each state with its relative probability according to the Boltzmann factor
(the property of a Boltzmann distribution that the energy of a state is proportional to the negative log probability of that state)
yields:

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the Boltzmann constant and is absorbed into the artificial notion of temperature formula_19.
Noting that the probabilities of the unit being &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; sum to formula_20 allows for the simplification:

:formula_21

whence the probability that the formula_5-th unit is given by

:formula_23

where the scalar formula_19 is referred to as the temperature of the system.
This relation is the source of the logistic function found in probability expressions in variants of the Boltzmann machine.

==Equilibrium state==
The network runs by repeatedly choosing a unit and resetting its state. After running for long enough at a certain temperature, the probability of a global state of the network depends only upon that global state&#x27;s energy, according to a Boltzmann distribution, and not on the initial state from which the process was started. This means that log-probabilities of global states become linear in their energies. This relationship is true when the machine is &quot;at thermal equilibrium&quot;, meaning that the probability distribution of global states has converged. Running the network beginning from a high temperature, its temperature gradually decreases until reaching a thermal equilibrium at a lower temperature. It then may converge to a distribution where the energy level fluctuates around the global minimum. This process is called simulated annealing.

To train the network so that the chance it will converge to a global state according to an external distribution over these states, the weights must be set so that the global states with the highest probabilities get the lowest energies. This is done by training.

==Training==
The units in the Boltzmann machine are divided into &#x27;visible&#x27; units, V, and &#x27;hidden&#x27; units, H. The visible units are those that receive information from the &#x27;environment&#x27;, i.e. the training set is a set of binary vectors over the set V. The distribution over the training set is denoted formula_25. 

The distribution over global states converges as the Boltzmann machine reaches thermal equilibrium. We denote this distribution, after we marginalize it over the hidden units, as formula_26.

Our goal is to approximate the &quot;real&quot; distribution formula_25 using the formula_26 produced by the machine. The similarity of the two distributions is measured by the Kullback–Leibler divergence, formula_29:

:formula_30

where the sum is over all the possible states of formula_31. formula_29 is a function of the weights, since they determine the energy of a state, and the energy determines formula_33, as promised by the Boltzmann distribution. A gradient descent algorithm over formula_29 changes a given weight, formula_3, by subtracting the partial derivative of formula_29 with respect to the weight.

Boltzmann machine training involves two alternating phases. One is the &quot;positive&quot; phase where the visible units&#x27; states are clamped to a particular binary state vector sampled from the training set (according to formula_37). The other is the &quot;negative&quot; phase where the network is allowed to run freely, i.e. only the input nodes have their state determined by external data, but the output nodes are allowed to float. The gradient with respect to a given weight, formula_3, is given by the equation:

:formula_39

where:
* formula_40 is the probability that units &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the positive phase.
* formula_41 is the probability that units &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the negative phase.
* formula_42 denotes the learning rate

This result follows from the fact that at thermal equilibrium the probability formula_43 of any global state formula_44 when the network is free-running is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

This learning rule is biologically plausible because the only information needed to change the weights is provided by &quot;local&quot; information. That is, the connection (synapse, biologically) does not need information about anything other than the two neurons it connects. This is more biologically realistic than the information needed by a connection in many other neural network training algorithms, such as backpropagation.

The training of a Boltzmann machine does not use the EM algorithm, which is heavily used in machine learning. By minimizing the KL-divergence, it is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Therefore, the training procedure performs gradient ascent on the log-likelihood of the observed data. This is in contrast to the EM algorithm, where the posterior distribution of the hidden nodes must be calculated before the maximization of the expected value of the complete data likelihood during the M-step.

Training the biases is similar, but uses only single node activity:

:formula_45

==Problems==
Theoretically the Boltzmann machine is a rather general computational medium. For instance, if trained on photographs, the machine would theoretically model the distribution of photographs, and could use that model to, for example, complete a partial photograph.

Unfortunately, Boltzmann machines experience a serious practical problem, namely that it seems to stop learning correctly when the machine is scaled up to anything larger than a trivial size. This is due to important effects, specifically:

* the required time order to collect equilibrium statistics grows exponentially with the machine&#x27;s size, and with the magnitude of the connection strengths
* connection strengths are more plastic when the connected units have activation probabilities intermediate between zero and one, leading to a so-called variance trap. The net effect is that noise causes the connection strengths to follow a random walk until the activities saturate.

==Types==
===Restricted Boltzmann machine===
Although learning is impractical in general Boltzmann machines, it can be made quite efficient in a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which does not allow intralayer connections between hidden units and visible units, i.e. there is no connection between visible to visible and hidden to hidden units. After training one RBM, the activities of its hidden units can be treated as data for training a higher-level RBM. This method of stacking RBMs makes it possible to train many layers of hidden units efficiently and is one of the most common deep learning strategies. As each new layer is added the generative model improves.

An extension to the restricted Boltzmann machine allows using real valued data rather than binary data.

One example of a practical RBM application is in speech recognition.

===Deep Boltzmann machine===
A deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) is a type of binary pairwise Markov random field (undirected probabilistic graphical model) with multiple layers of hidden random variables. It is a network of symmetrically coupled stochastic binary units. It comprises a set of visible units formula_46 and layers of hidden units formula_47. No connection links units of the same layer (like RBM). For the , the probability assigned to vector is
: formula_48
where formula_49 are the set of hidden units, and formula_50 are the model parameters, representing visible-hidden and hidden-hidden interactions. In a DBN only the top two layers form a restricted Boltzmann machine (which is an undirected graphical model), while lower layers form a directed generative model. In a DBM all layers are symmetric and undirected.

Like DBNs, DBMs can learn complex and abstract internal representations of the input in tasks such as object or speech recognition, using limited, labeled data to fine-tune the representations built using a large set of unlabeled sensory input data. However, unlike DBNs and deep convolutional neural networks, they pursue the inference and training procedure in both directions, bottom-up and top-down, which allow the DBM to better unveil the representations of the input structures.

However, the slow speed of DBMs limits their performance and functionality. Because exact maximum likelihood learning is intractable for DBMs, only approximate maximum likelihood learning is possible. Another option is to use mean-field inference to estimate data-dependent expectations and approximate the expected sufficient statistics by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This approximate inference, which must be done for each test input, is about 25 to 50 times slower than a single bottom-up pass in DBMs. This makes joint optimization impractical for large data sets, and restricts the use of DBMs for tasks such as feature representation.

===Spike-and-slab RBMs===
The need for deep learning with real-valued inputs, as in Gaussian RBMs, led to the spike-and-slab RBM (&quot;ss&quot;RBM), which models continuous-valued inputs with binary latent variables. Similar to basic RBMs and its variants, a spike-and-slab RBM is a bipartite graph, while like GRBMs, the visible units (input) are real-valued. The difference is in the hidden layer, where each hidden unit has a binary spike variable and a real-valued slab variable. A spike is a discrete probability mass at zero, while a slab is a density over continuous domain; their mixture forms a prior.

An extension of ssRBM called μ-ssRBM provides extra modeling capacity using additional terms in the energy function. One of these terms enables the model to form a conditional distribution of the spike variables by marginalizing out the slab variables given an observation.

===In mathematics===
In more general mathematical setting, the Boltzmann distribution is also known as the Gibbs measure. In statistics and machine learning it is called a log-linear model. In deep learning the Boltzmann distribution is used in the sampling distribution of stochastic neural networks such as the Boltzmann machine.

==History==
The Boltzmann machine is based on the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick spin glass model by David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick. The seminal publication by John Hopfield (1982) applied methods of statistical mechanics, mainly the recently developed (1970s) theory of spin glasses, to study associative memory (later named the &quot;Hopfield network&quot;).

The original contribution in applying such energy-based models in cognitive science appeared in papers by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski. In a 1995 interview, Hinton stated that in 1983 February or March, he was going to give a talk on simulated annealing in Hopfield networks, so he had to design a learning algorithm for the talk, resulting in the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm.

The idea of applying the Ising model with annealed Gibbs sampling was used in Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s Copycat project (1984).

The explicit analogy drawn with statistical mechanics in the Boltzmann machine formulation led to the use of terminology borrowed from physics (e.g., &quot;energy&quot;), which became standard in the field. The widespread adoption of this terminology may have been encouraged by the fact that its use led to the adoption of a variety of concepts and methods from statistical mechanics. The various proposals to use simulated annealing for inference were apparently independent.

Similar ideas (with a change of sign in the energy function) are found in Paul Smolensky&#x27;s &quot;Harmony Theory&quot;. Ising models can be generalized to Markov random fields, which find widespread application in linguistics, robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence.

In 2024, Hopfield and Hinton were awarded Nobel Prize in Physics for their foundational contributions to machine learning, such as the Boltzmann machine.

<text>Agrapha (; Greek for &quot;non written&quot;; singular ) are sayings of Jesus that are not found in the canonical Gospels. The term was used for the first time by J.G. Körner, a German Bible scholar, in 1776.

==Definition of agrapha==

According to A. J. Maas, supposed agrapha must satisfy three conditions:

* They must be sayings, not discourses – works like the &quot;Didascalia&quot; and the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, that speak of Jesus, but do not quote him, are not considered agrapha
* They must be sayings of Jesus – agrapha are not sayings found in religious romances such as those found in apocryphal Gospels, the apocryphal Acts, or the Letter of Christ to Abgar, etc.
* They must not be in the canonical Gospels

Mere additions to pre-existing sayings are not considered agrapha.

==Examples==

According to A. J. Maas, for agrapha to be genuine, they must be supported by external and internal evidence. This means that early writers, like Papias, Clement, Irenaeus, and Justin Martyr would have quoted them, and the message of the agrapha must not conflict with the teachings of Jesus contained in the canonical Gospels.

=== New Testament===

* Acts 20:35: &quot;Remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.&quot;

===Church Orders===

* Apostolic Church Order, 26: &quot;For he said to us before, when he was teaching: That which is weak shall be saved through that which is strong.&quot;

===Patristic citations===
* Clement of Rome, &quot;First Epistle of Clement&quot;, 13: &quot;For thus He spoke: &#x27;Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same it shall be measured to you.&#x27;&quot;
* Polycarp of Smyrna, &quot;Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians&quot;, 2, &quot;but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: &#x27;Judge not, that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again;&#x27; and once more, &#x27;Blessed are the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness&#x27; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.&#x27;&quot;
*Papias of Hierapolis, &quot;The Expositions of the Saying of the Lord&quot;, 4: &quot;As the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord remembered that they had heard from him how the Lord taught in regard to those times, and said: &#x27;The days will come in which vines shall grow, having each ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.&#x27; In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar proportions; and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.&#x27;&quot;
* Justin Martyr, &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, 47: &quot;Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ said, In whatsoever things I apprehend you, in those I shall judge you.&quot; 
* Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Stromata&quot;, I, 24, 158: &quot;For ask, he says for the great things, and the small shall be added to you.&quot; 
* Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Stromata&quot;, I, 28, 177: &quot;Rightly therefore the Scripture also in its desire to make us such dialecticians, exhorts us: Be approved moneychangers, disapproving some things, but holding fast that which is good.&quot;
* Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Stromata&quot;, V, 10, 64: &quot;For not grudgingly, he saith, did the Lord declare in a certain gospel: My mystery is for me and for the sons of my house.&quot; 
* Origen, &quot;Homily on Jeremiah&quot;, XX, 3: &quot;But the Saviour himself saith: He who is near me is near the fire; he who is far from me, is far from the kingdom.&quot;

<doc id="1166062" wikidata="Q7071980" url="?curid=1166062" title="O(1) scheduler">
<text>An O(1) scheduler (pronounced &quot;O of 1 scheduler&quot;, &quot;Big O of 1 scheduler&quot;, or &quot;constant time scheduler&quot;) is a kernel scheduling design that can schedule processes within a constant amount of time, regardless of how many processes are running on the operating system. This is an improvement over previously used O(n) schedulers, which schedule processes in an amount of time that scales linearly based on the amounts of inputs.

In the realm of real-time operating systems, deterministic execution is key, and an O(1) scheduler is able to provide scheduling services with a fixed upper-bound on execution times.

The O(1) scheduler was used in Linux releases 2.6.0 through 2.6.22 (2003-2007), at which point it was superseded by the Completely Fair Scheduler.

== Overview ==
The Linux scheduler was overhauled completely with the release of kernel 2.6 in 2003. The new scheduler was called the O(1) scheduler. The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to the expired array. Once all the tasks from the active array have exhausted their time quantum and have been moved to the expired array, an array switch takes place. Because the arrays are accessed only via pointer, switching them is as fast as swapping two pointers. This switch makes the active array the new empty expired array, while the expired array becomes the active array.

== About O(1) notation ==

An algorithm operates over an input, and the size of that input usually determines its running time. Big O notation is used to denote the growth rate of an algorithm&#x27;s execution time based on the amount of input. For example, the running time of an O(n) algorithm increases linearly as the input size n grows. The running time of an O(n) algorithm grows quadratically. If it is possible to establish a constant upper bound on the running time of an algorithm, it is considered to be O(1) (one might say it runs in &quot;constant time&quot;). That is, an O(1) algorithm is guaranteed to complete in a certain amount of time regardless of the size of the input.

== Improvement in Linux scheduler performance ==
The Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler did not contain any algorithms that run in worse than O(1) time. That is, every part of the scheduler is guaranteed to execute within a certain constant amount of time regardless of how many tasks are on the system. This allows the Linux kernel to efficiently handle massive numbers of tasks without increasing overhead costs as the number of tasks grows. There are two key data structures in the Linux 2.6.8.1 scheduler that allow for it to perform its duties in O(1) time, and its design revolves around them: runqueues and priority arrays.

== Issues ==
The main issue with this algorithm is the complex heuristics used to mark a task as interactive or non-interactive. The algorithm tries to identify interactive processes by analyzing average sleep time (the amount of time the process spends waiting for input). Processes that sleep for long periods of time probably are waiting for user input, so the scheduler assumes they&#x27;re interactive. The scheduler gives a priority bonus to interactive tasks (for better throughput) while penalizing non-interactive tasks by lowering their priorities. All the calculations to determine the interactivity of tasks are complex and subject to potential miscalculations, causing non-interactive behavior from an interactive process.

== Replacement ==
In 2.6.23 (October 2007), the Completely Fair Scheduler was introduced, replacing the O(1) Scheduler. According to Ingo Molnar, the author of the CFS, its core design can be summed up in single sentence: &quot;CFS basically models an &#x27;ideal, precise multitasking CPU&#x27; on real hardware.&quot;

<doc id="1166071" wikidata="Q6652326" url="?curid=1166071" title="Little Tramp">
<text>: &quot;See The Tramp for the character played by Charlie Chaplin&quot;.

Little Tramp is a musical with a book by David Pomeranz and Steven David Horwich and music and lyrics by David Pomeranz.

Based on the life of comedian Charles Chaplin and named after his most famous character, The Tramp, it opens at the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony at which the aging star, long exiled from the United States, is about to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. The trajectory of the impressive professional career and turbulent private life that leads to this moment is traced via flashbacks in which Chaplin recalls his introduction to Hollywood and silent movies, his failed marriages and problems with the press, his dealings with the FBI, and the creation of his most beloved character, the iconic Little Tramp.
In 1992, in order to create interest in a staged production, Pomeranz gathered together what he referred to as his &quot;dream cast&quot; and recorded a CD of the score. Artists participating in the project included Petula Clark, Lea Salonga, Tim Curry, Mel Brooks, Treat Williams, and Peter Duncan as Chaplin. It was released on the Warner Music UK Ltd. label.

&quot;Little Tramp&quot; received its first staging in 1995 at the prestigious Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Festival in Waterford, Connecticut (Eugene O&#x27;Neill having been the father of Chaplin&#x27;s wife, Oona O&#x27;Neill). The following year, a concert version was presented in St. Petersburg, Russia to inaugurate the world&#x27;s first East/West Musical Theater Conference.

The show was first performed in the UK by Imagine Productions in Preston, and was endorsed by Richard Attenborough, director of the biopic &quot;Chaplin&quot;.

==Synopsis==
At the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, an 82-year-old Charlie Chaplin is about to receive a special Life Achievement award. 20 years earlier, Charlie had been barred from re-entry into the United States on the grounds that he was a Communist (&quot;In America Again&quot;).

Charlie looks back at his life. His mother, a failed music hall performer, trying to make ends meet to support little Charlie and his older brother Sydney, reminds her sons that they have something more than mere material possessions (&quot;Something No One Can Ever Take Away&quot;).

Not able to support her children, Hannah Chaplin is taken to the workhouse. The boys try selling their old clothing on the streets but there are no takers. Hungry and heartbroken, Sydney tries to cheer things up (&quot;When the World Stops Turning&quot;) while the Charlie of 1971 rejoins them.

When Sydney joined the Navy, Charlie is left to fend for himself. Determined to help his mother, Charlie joined a dance troupe called &quot;The Eight Lancashire Lads&quot;, but his mother&#x27;s condition worsens, and she is placed in an insane asylum. Dodging truant officers, Charlie sees a sign, &quot;Blackmore&#x27;s Theatrical Agency&quot; and barges into the agent&#x27;s office (&quot;Number One&quot;).

Now grown up and a consummate English Stage comedian, Charlie is discovered by filmmaker Mack Sennett and signed to a contract at Keystone Studios in California. Sennett&#x27;s style of &quot;pie in the face&quot; comedy is different from Chaplin&#x27;s slower, more deliberate style, and when Charlie tries to assert his ideas, Sennett gives him some strong advice (&quot;Less It Ends with a Chase&quot;).

Charlie is relentless. Sennett finally throws up his hands in frustration and gives Charlie a chance (&quot;The Tramp&quot;/&quot;He&#x27;s Got to be Someone&quot;).

Charlie becomes an overnight sensation. Film distributors, fans and theater owners can&#x27;t get enough of him (&quot;Chaplin Films&quot;).

Charlie opens his own picture studio, and he becomes one of the most beloved public figures. One evening, he is visited by a local chapter of Chaplin Fan Club (&quot;Thank You&quot;).

By this time, Sydney returns as Charlie&#x27;s personal manager. Getting ready for a swank Hollywood party, Sydney reminisces how far they&#x27;ve come (&quot;Heaven&quot;).

Back to 1971, Charlie&#x27;s wife, Oona, is instructed by the show&#x27;s assistant director on how Charlie should play to the camera. Furthermore, a government official then warns her that Charlie should avoid making any political comments. Oona is incensed (&quot;He&#x27;s Got to be Someone (Reprise)&quot;).

The story returns to the 1920s. Charlie&#x27;s career and personal life are at a low point. His mother just died, and he just underwent two bitter divorces. He is overworked, reporters are on to him and to make things worse, talking pictures are threatening his artistic survival (&quot;Too Many Words&quot;).

Nonetheless his success continued, and Charlie revisits England to attend a Royal Premiere of &quot;City Lights&quot;. He wanders through his old neighborhood and is stunned that injustice and poverty still exists. In an effort to improve such degenerate conditions, he decides to speak out on behalf of the Russian War Relief. He contends that it&#x27;s no concern whether or not these people are Communist, they&#x27;re being slaughtered by the Nazis. After one of his speeches, FBI agent Tippy Gray takes notes and reports his finding to Bureau Chief J. Edgar Hoover (&quot;I Got Me a Red&quot;/&quot;There&#x27;s Got to be a Law&quot;).

A paternity suit is filed against Chaplin, giving Hoover ammunition he needed. Although a blood test disproves the allegation, the press crucifies him. His fans turn on him and his films are boycotted. Charlie is dejected. He is convinced that it is just a matter of time before his new wife Oona leaves him too. However. Oona assures him that she won&#x27;t (&quot;This is What I Dreamed&quot;).

The Chaplins decide to cruise Europe, but aboard the ship, Charlie receives a cable from Washington stating that in order to re-enter the U.S., he must answer to political and moral charges. Crestfallen, Charlie decided to spend the next 20 years living in Veney, Switzerland.

Back to 1971, Charlie is escorted to the stage while deeply regarding what he will tell his audience (&quot;Finale&quot;).

<doc id="1166078" wikidata="Q6508605" url="?curid=1166078" title="Leaders' debate">
<text>A leaders&#x27; debate or presidential debate is a public debate held during a general election campaign, where the candidates expose their political opinions and public policy proposals, and criticism of them, to potential voters. They are normally broadcast live on radio, television and the Internet. The events may be organized by media corporations or non-government organizations.

Leaders&#x27; debates are often popular with voters, whose decisions might be greatly influenced by the outcome. Leaders have occasionally attempted to use props (such as charts or signs bearing slogans) during a debate with varying degrees of success.

==History==
Precursors to television debates were the candidate forums broadcast over radio in elections in the 1920s. The success of early televised debates such as the 1960 American presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, viewed by 70 million people, would eventually spur the desire to hold similar, televised debates in countries under the parliamentary system. Television had quickly proven to be an excellent and efficient means of reaching out to large blocs of the electorate. The unique aspect of the parliamentary system which creates the desire to hold leaders&#x27; debates is that the party leader is usually the party&#x27;s presumed candidate to lead the government, because by constitutional convention he or she will usually become prime minister or premier if his or her party is able to obtain a majority, by itself or as part of a coalition government. However, a leaders&#x27; debate is not technically a candidates debate in the same sense that an American presidential debate would be, because in the latter case the American political parties have explicitly nominated the named individuals as their candidates for president and vice president.

==Format==
The exact format for a leaders&#x27; debate varies, but normally the debate will begin with each leader making a short opening statement. Then a panel of well-known journalists will ask sets of prepared questions, which are to be answered either by all of the leaders or by one specific leader. After the leader(s) answer each question, the other leader(s) may get a chance to make a brief response, after which there may be some time allocated for an often heated &quot;free for all&quot; debate. The moderator will usually attempt to exercise some control through all of this, and then stop the debate after time has elapsed so the next question can be asked. After the panelists finish asking questions, each leader will make his or her closing remarks and the debate will end.

Who gets invited to participate in a leaders&#x27; debate is often a sensitive issue. Some jurisdictions may have dozens of fringe political parties which few networks would care to have participating in their debates. For the sake of brevity, and to ensure the leaders of the main parties have adequate time to address voters on a wide range of issues, it is extremely rare for any leaders&#x27; debate to have more than five leaders. A more common number would be three while Australia has two. Leaders&#x27; debates are often restricted to parties which elected representatives in the previous election. Exceptions may be made for parties with close to a full slate of candidates, but this is not always the case. For example, in Canada in the 2004 and 2006 the Green Party of Canada was excluded from the federal leaders&#x27; debates until 2008 when public pressure on the other parties allowed the Green Party to join the debate, and the Alberta Alliance was excluded from the Albertan provincial leaders debate, even though both parties had full slates in their respective elections. Parties that are excluded will often complain bitterly about their exclusion, sometimes claiming that the political establishment has conspired in an effort to keep their party on the political fringe. The inclusion of certain parties in debates can be controversial too. A common complaint about the Canadian debates is voiced by a report from the Centre for the Study of Democracy, which calls for the Bloc Québécois, a party only active in mostly French-speaking Quebec, to be removed from its current position in the English-language debates.

In Georgia, debates were often so heated that the debaters would be placed in separate rooms.

The 2019 Ukrainian presidential election innovated a new approach to the concept of a leaders&#x27; debate, where now-president, then-candidate Volodymyr Zelensky proposed to hold debates publicly in the country&#x27;s largest stadium, the Kyiv Olympic Stadium. After much negotiation, the debates were held 48 hours before the election between then-president Peter Poroshenko and Zelensky, in front of nearly 30,000 spectators.

<text>David Joseph Levac (born April 6, 1954) is a retired Canadian politician who was the 41st speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2011 to 2018. Levac was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1999 as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party. He served as the member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Brant until 2018 and is the Ontario legislature&#x27;s longest serving speaker.

==Background==
Born in Brantford, Ontario, Levac attended Wilfrid Laurier University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1976. He completed teacher&#x27;s college at Queen&#x27;s University in 1977, beginning to work a teacher in the early 1980s, and became a principal in Brantford in 1989. In 1992, he attended Niagara University to complete a master&#x27;s degree in education. Levac received the Canada 125 Medal in 1993, was named OECTA Distinguished Teacher in 1994 for his work in conflict resolution programs, and was named Brantford&#x27;s Citizen of the Year in 1997 by readers of the &quot;Brantford Expositor&quot;. He also served as co-ordinator of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Royal Visit to Brantford in 1997. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. In 2011 he was awarded the Chevalier of the Order of Merit for his educational efforts with respect to the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s.

==Political career==
Levac was elected in the 1999 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate Alayne Sokoloski by 956 votes in the riding of Brant. The PCs won a majority government in this election, and Levac sat as an opposition member for the next four years.

The Liberals won a majority government in the 2003 provincial election and Levac again defeated Sokoloski, this time by over 10,000 votes. Levac was named chief government whip. Levac was re-elected in 2007, 2011, and 2014.

On April 9, 2009 Levac, along with co-sponsors Cheri DiNovo and Frank Klees passed bill 147 – the &quot;Holodomor Memorial Day Act&quot;. This was the first piece of legislation in Ontario history to be introduced with tri-partisan sponsorship. This historic legislation recognizes Ukrainian man-made famine as an act of Genocide.

On January 25, 2010, Levac was named parliamentary assistant to the minister of energy and infrastructure.

After the 2011 election, Levac was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He beat three other Liberal members, David Zimmer, Kevin Flynn, and Donna Cansfield. Cansfield was an early favourite for the position but lost to Levac on a second ballot after the New Democratic Party (NDP) voted in a bloc for Levac. No NDP or PC members put their names forward due to the Liberal government&#x27;s delicate one-seat minority status in the legislature. Levac was re-elected as speaker after the 2014 election defeating four other contenders.

On May 5, 2017, Levac announced he would not run for his seat again in the 2018 Ontario general election after 19 years in the legislature and seven of those years as speaker.

In 2022, Levac was appointed to the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="1166090" wikidata="Q7868025" url="?curid=1166090" title="USS Camden (AS-6)">
<text>USS &quot;Camden&quot; (AS-6) was the first ship of the United States Navy to bear the name Camden, after Camden, New Jersey the city that lies on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Initially a German cargo ship known as Kiel, the vessel was seized during World War I and entered into service with the US Navy in 1917 after having her name changed to &quot;Camden&quot;. She later saw service as a submarine tender and a barracks ship before her sale in 1946.

==United States service history==
===Cargo ship, 1917-1918===
The ship was built in 1900 by Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, Flensburg, Germany, as SS &quot;Kiel&quot;. The vessel was seized by the United States after its entry into World War I in April 1917; transferred from the Shipping Board on 22 May 1917; fitted out as a cargo ship and commissioned on 15 August 1917 as USS &quot;Camden&quot; with the identification number ID-3143.

Clearing New York in September 1917, &quot;Camden&quot; carried coal between Cardiff, Wales, and French ports, with one voyage to the United States, until 25 April 1918, when she again sailed for the U.S. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 3 May for conversion into a submarine tender.

===Submarine tender, 1919-1931===
&quot;Camden&quot; began her many years of service with submarines on 21 February 1919, when she was re-commissioned as a submarine tender with the identification number AS-6. Based out of New London, Connecticut, she was flagship for Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, and Commander, Submarine Division 9 (SubDiv 9) until 15 September 1920. After repairs at Norfolk, Virginia, she followed her division to the Pacific, where she took up tender duties based on San Pedro, Los Angeles on 24 June 1921. She briefly served as flagship of Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Pacific Fleet early in 1922, and in March 1923 returned to the Atlantic for duty. As flagship of SubDiv 4 at New London, and later as flagship of Commander, Control Force, she led in large-scale maneuvers and exercises. Highlights of this period included her participation in determined efforts to raise the submarine in September–October 1925, and her presence at the presidential Naval Review in Hampton Roads in May 1927. &quot;Camden&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1931.

===Barracks ship, 1940-1946===
War called the veteran back from retirement, and on 17 September 1940 &quot;Camden&quot; was reclassified IX-42, and assigned to New York Navy Yard as a barracks ship. Towed by tug &quot;USS Allegheny (AT-19)&quot;, the floating barracks arrived at Pier 92, New York City on 18 September, and performed her humble but essential role of berthing the war-swollen complement of the yard until 23 October 1946, when she was sold.

<doc id="1166091" wikidata="Q714956" url="?curid=1166091" title="John Salazar">
<text>John Tony Salazar (born July 21, 1953) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 until 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was appointed Commissioner of the Colorado Department of Agriculture in the Cabinet of Governor John Hickenlooper in 2011, following his 
electoral defeat in 2010. Salazar announced his retirement as Agriculture Commissioner in November 2014.

==Early life, education and career==
Salazar was born in Alamosa, Colorado, the son of Emma M. (Montoya) and Henry (Enrique) S. Salazar. His younger brother is former Senator Ken Salazar.

Salazar served in the U.S. Army from 1973 to 1976, and is a farmer and rancher. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Adams State College in 1981. Salazar was the owner of an internet company, Spudseed.com, which marketed potatoes, as well as serving as a director of 
Monte Vista Production Credit Union and Agro Engineering, Inc.

Salazar served on several Colorado public bodies including the Governor&#x27;s Economic Development Advisory Board, the Rio Grande Water Conservation District and the Colorado Agricultural Leadership Forum. He also served on the Colorado Agricultural Commission from 1999 to 2002 before being elected to the Colorado House of Representatives from 2003 until 2004.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
**Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
*Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming

==Political positions==
Salazar was concerned with water rights in particular. He said his top priority on Capitol Hill was to ensure that water derived from the snow melt of Colorado&#x27;s Western Slope would stay in his district instead of being sent to California or Nevada.

Though a Democrat, he exhibited conservative leanings. He opposed expanding gun control and supported permanent repeal of the inheritance tax and lower taxes. He also supports allowing Americans to buy cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. He was a member of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats, leading him to oppose Democratic priority measures such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Clean Energy and Security Act in 2009. During consideration of the Affordable Care Act, he voted in favor of the Stupak Amendment restricting federal funding of elective abortions. However, he also voted for the Senate version of the health care bill lacking the Stupak Amendment language.

As a veteran, a son of a veteran, and father of a child serving in the Colorado National Guard as of 2004, Salazar was also vocal against cuts to veterans&#x27; benefits. Salazar introduced the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, designed to protect the integrity of medals, to the House of Representatives, which he has cited as his best achievement in politics.

Salazar was considered for the post of Secretary of Agriculture by Barack Obama but Tom Vilsack was chosen instead.

==Political campaigns==
===2004===
Salazar was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004. His election to succeed retiring Republican Scott McInnis was one of the most contested House elections of the year. Salazar defeated Greg Walcher who had attacked Salazar as being soft on illegal immigration, while Salazar criticised Walcher for his previous support of a failed 2003 referendum which he said would have diverted water from the district, an important issue in western Colorado. In a year when Republicans made gains, John Salazar was only one of three Democratic pick-up seats in the House of Representatives.

===2006===
John Salazar was re-elected in 2006 after his first term in Congress defeating Republican Scott Tipton. John Salazar raised almost three times as much money as Tipton and won over 60% of the vote, including more Republican areas of the district. Salazar had campaigned as a moderate, middle of the road candidate, with the opinion polls having shown him ahead in the election.

===2008===

Salazar won in 2008 with a similar margin as 2006 defeating rancher and county commissioner Wayne Wolf. Salazar had a massive fundraising advantage over Wolf who only had about $16,000 for the campaign.

===2010===

Salazar was defeated for re-election by Republican Scott Tipton. Tipton had unsuccessfully challenged Salazar in 2006. Libertarian Gregory Gilman and Independent Jake Segrest were also on the ballot; Independents John W. Hargis, Sr. and James Fritz qualified as write-in candidates.

==Electoral history==
==Personal life==
Salazar is married to Mary Lou Salazar and has three children: Esteban, Miguel and Jesus. They live in Manassa, Colorado.

Salazar&#x27;s younger brother, Ken Salazar, is a former United States Senator from Colorado and the former Secretary of the Interior appointed by President Barack Obama.

<text>Hetchin&#x27;s, originally Hetchin&#x27;s Lightweight Cycle Specialists, simplified to Hetchin&#x27;s Lightweights since 1993, is a brand of bicycle frame. It takes its name from the founder of the firm, Hyman Hetchin.

==History==
Hyman Hetchin was a Russian Jew who fled the Bolshevik revolution around 1917 and settled in Britain. By 1922, Hetchin had opened a shop in Seven Sisters Road, Tottenham, North London, selling household appliances including gramophones, sheet music, shellac 78 rpm records, and, later, bicycles.
At first Hetchin resold mass-produced bicycles, including Raleigh and Rudge.

Jack Denny was a London frame builder who had a shop at 194 Wandsworth Road, not far from Seven Sisters Road.
Denny had experimented with an innovative design involving curved stays; Hetchin recognized the marketing potential of the design, partnered with Denny, and patented the design in 1934.
From then on, Hetchin stopped re-selling other bicycle marques, and produced and sold only his own.

The partnership soon brought rewards in the form of Olympic and World&#x27;s Championship victories in 1936. Sales were strong thereafter, reaching a pre-war peak of over 600 frames in 1938 and 500 in 1939. The war years saw production fall to below 200 frames per year; sales did not recover until 1953.
These are remarkable figures for a shop which consisted of one man who took care of sales and marketing (Hyman Hetchin) and one frame builder (Jack Denny). In the 1950s, additional help was recruited, consisting of part-time lug cutters (including Ken Janes) and frame builders (chiefly Bob Stratfull and Stan Broom). The partnership endured past Hyman&#x27;s death in 1961, when Hyman&#x27;s son Alfred (&#x27;Alf&#x27;) took over the business.

Apart from the patented curly (or &quot;vibrant&quot;) stays, Hetchin&#x27;s frames were (and still are) known for ornate, and often hand-cut, lugwork. Other design innovations are attributed to Hetchin/Denny, such as a fluted seat tube on six-day racers (this brings the rear wheel closer to the seat tube than on conventional bicycle frames, shortening the wheelbase).
Hetchin supported many racers and racing teams, especially track and six-day contestants, over the years.

In 1974, the shop moved to Southend-On-Sea (forced, due to re-zoning of the Tottenham property). Alf continued to manage the business until his retirement in 1986, when he sold the shop to a London businessman. For a short time, Hetchin&#x27;s and Bob Jackson Cycles (Leeds) were fused, but the two marques separated in 1993. Since 1993, the Hetchin&#x27;s operation has been centered in Preston (UK) under the management of David Miller; the current frame builder is Paul Riley.

Hetchin&#x27;s Lightweights continues to produce bespoke lugged-steel bicycle frames. Approximately 12,000 frames have been produced to date (2015), counting from 1934, of which some 16% are known to have survived. The frames are highly sought by collectors.

<text>Recurrent miscarriage or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is the spontaneous loss of 2-3 pregnancies that is estimated to affect up to 5% of women. The exact number of pregnancy losses and gestational weeks used to define RPL differs among medical societies. In the majority of cases, the exact cause of pregnancy loss is unexplained despite genetic testing and a thorough evaluation. When a cause for RPL is identified, almost half are attributed to a chromosomal abnormality (ie. aneuploidy). RPL has been associated with several risk factors including parental and genetic factors (ie. advanced maternal age, chromosomal abnormalities, sperm DNA fragmentation), congenital and acquired anatomical conditions, lifestyle factors (ie. cigarette smoking, caffeine, alcohol, stress), endocrine disorders, thrombophila (clotting disorders), immunological factors, and infections. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends a thorough evaluation after 2 consecutive pregnancy losses; however, this can differ from recommendations by other medical societies. RPL evaluation can be evaluated by numerous tests and imaging studies depending on the risk factors. These range from cytogenetic studies, blood tests for clotting disorders, hormone levels, diabetes screening, thyroid function tests, sperm analysis, antibody testing, and imaging studies. Treatment is typically tailored to the relevant risk factors and test findings. RPL can have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of couples and has been associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Therefore, it is recommended that appropriate screening and management (ie. pharmacologic, counseling services) be considered by medical providers.   

== Epidemiology ==
Pregnancy loss, also referred to as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, occurs in up to 25% of pregnancies. Recurrent pregnancy loss occurs less frequently and it is estimated that 5% of women experience two consecutive pregnancy losses while only 1% experience three or more.

== Etiology and risk factors ==
The cause of recurrent pregnancy is unknown in about 50% of cases. Risk factors that have been associated with RPL include parental and genetic factors (advanced maternal age, chromosomal abnormalities, sperm DNA fragmentation), anatomical conditions, lifestyle factors, endocrine disorders, thrombophila (bleeding disorders), immunological factors, and infections. Despite thorough evaluation for these risk factors, the exact cause for recurrent pregnancy loss is unknown in about 50% of cases.

=== Parental and genetic factors ===

* Advanced maternal age: Maternal age is associated with increased risk of miscarriage with a rate of 50% in women over 40 years of age. This higher likelihood of pregnancy loss can be attributed to the higher incidence of trisomies, a chromosomal abnormality, seen in women over the age of 35.
* Chromosomal abnormalities: Recurrent pregnancy loss is most commonly found to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. These include structural aberrations (such as chromosomal inversions, insertions, deletions, and translocations) and numerical aberrations, also called aneuploidies (trisomies, monosomy X, and triploidy). These can be detected by cytogenetic testing such as karyotyping (test that analyzes the structure and quantity of chromosomes), FISH, MLPA, aCGH, and SNP array. Some research suggests that chromosomal abnormalities occur more frequently in sporadic pregnancy loss than in recurrent pregnancy loss, and the incidence of RPL is lower in women with 3 or more pregnancy losses. Parental chromosomal abnormalities is a rare cause of RPL, found in approximately 2-4% cases. Studies comparing pregnancy outcomes in couples experiencing RPL with and without chromosomal abnormalities found that parental carriers of chromosomal abnormalities had a lower live birth rate, specifically carriers of a reciprocal/balanced Robertsonian translocation. This evidence suggests that although RPL can occur in both couples with and without chromosomal aberrations, those that do are at higher risk of pregnancy loss. Previous studies produced conflicting results. Genetic evaluation of RPL is generally recommended in order to determine the need for genetic counseling and appropriate treatment. This, however, can differ among medical societies where others recommend against routine cytogenetic testing for couples experiencing RPL as it is of little clinical benefit. It is instead considered after individual risk assessment (ie. family history) and recommended to test parental chromosomes rather than the products of conception.
* Paternal Factors: There is emerging research that suggests male factors may contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. A systematic review found that sperm DNA fragmentation, defined as breaks in the DNA strand of sperm cells, may be associated with RPL. Their findings included higher rates of SDF and other sperm parameters (ie. lower sperm number, motility, or ejaculation volume) in men experiencing RPL. No evidence of a relationship between RPL and paternal age, BMI, smoking, or alcohol use. The European Association of Urology Guidelines on Sexual and Reproductive Health therefore recommends SDF testing in cases of infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss.

=== Anatomical conditions ===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical reason for the inability to complete the pregnancy. The structure of the uterus has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital or acquired.

* Congenital: Congenital uterine malformations include unicornuate, septate, bicornate, didelphic, and arcuate uteri. The relationship between uterine abnormalities that are present from birth and RPL is unclear, however, there is an association with pregnancy loss. These structural anomalies are a result of disruption of the Müllerian tract during development. These can be found in approximately 12.6% of RPL cases with the highest incidences occurring in patients with septate (44.3%), bicornuate (36%), and arcuate (25.7%) uteri. These Structural uterine abnormalities can be visualized by several imaging studies including, hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, and MRI.
* Acquired: Other structural uterine anomalies such as uterine fibroids, polyps, and adhesions (also known as Asherman&#x27;s syndrome) have a less clear association with recurrent pregnancy loss. Cervical weakness has been shown to lead to premature pregnancy loss resulting in miscarriages or preterm deliveries. It has been estimated that cervical insufficiency is a cause in about 8% of women with second trimester recurrent miscarriages.

=== Lifestyle factors ===

While lifestyle factors have been associated with increased risk for miscarriage in general, and are usually not listed as specific causes for RPL. These include cigarette smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol use, BMI, and stress.

* Smoking: There is limited research that directly looks at the association of cigarette smoking and RPL. Recently, a systematic review that looked at studies evaluating the link between RPL and smoking was unable to find a significant difference in risk of recurrent pregnancy loss between people that smoke and non-smokers. This review did not address e-cigarettes and vaping given that the authors did not find any studies that looked into the relationship between these forms of smoking and RPL. The relationship between smoking and the risk of miscarriage has been extensively researched. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, there is some evidence that active cigarette smoking increases the risk of miscarriage and this risk is further increased the more cigarettes that a person smokes a day. This same review highlights that according to the Surgeon General&#x27;s report in 2010, research supports that smoking during pregnancy can also lead to pregnancy complications such as placental abruption, preterm delivery, and low birthweight among other maternal health risks.
* Caffeine: research regarding the association of caffeine intake and spontaneous pregnancy loss has produced inconsistent results in previous years due to the influence of multiple factors and limitations in data collection among the studies. The same systematic review that looked at the relationship between cigarette smoking and RPL in 2021 found that there was no increased risk of RPL with the consumption of caffeine. There have been more recent studies that have assessed the relationship between caffeine and miscarriage. A systematic review found that coffee consumption before and during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. The risk of pregnancy loss increased by 3% with each additional cup of coffee consumed during pregnancy. There was also an increased risk of pregnancy loss of 14-26% with the consumption of an additional 100 mg of caffeine (coffee, tea, soda, cacao) per day during pregnancy. This increased risk was not seen if the caffeine products were consumed prior to pregnancy. The harmful effects of caffeine during pregnancy can be attributed to its ability to absorb rapidly into the bloodstream and cross into the placenta, along with the slowed breakdown of caffeine that occurs during pregnancy which can expose the fetus to caffeine and its metabolites for a prolonged period of time. Caffeine consumption can also lead to maternal cardiovascular effects that reduce placental blood flow, putting the development of the fetus at risk.
* Alcohol Use: Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been shown to have damaging effects on the cognitive development of the fetus and has been associated with low birthweight among other features of Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders due to its teratogenic effects. Similar to smoking and caffeine consumption, research studies assessing the relationship between alcohol use and pregnancy loss have produced inconsistent results. A systematic review that looked at several maternal lifestyle factors and the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss found no statistically significant increased risk in women that consumed any form of alcohol during pregnancy compared to those that did not. These findings are similar to a recent review that looked at alcohol intake in the first and second trimester and found no increased risk of miscarriage. The authors report that this may have been due to a limited number of studies included in the review, considering the exclusion of studies that did not differentiate trimesters or account for other external factors (such as smoking, maternal age, maternal BMI) that have been linked to pregnancy loss. There is evidence that in women that drink 5 or less alcoholic drinks per week, there is a 6% increased risk of miscarriage with each additional alcoholic drink consumed when the specific trimester is not specified. Due to the inability to determine a safe range of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, multiple medical societies recommend avoiding alcohol to prevent the potential harm to the fetus.
* BMI: Maternal obesity and an elevated Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, although no clear cause has been established. Studies suggest that pregnancy loss could be influenced by the downstream effects of the hormonal disruption of the HPA axis and insulin resistance that can be associated with obesity, on the reproductive system disrupting the development of oocytes, embryos, or the integrity of the endometrium (uterine lining). Despite this evidence, research studies aimed to establish a relationship between RPL and BMI, which incorporates height and weight, have produced inconsistent results. A systematic review found that women with a history of RPL had higher BMI&#x27;s by an average difference of 0.9 kg/m² than women without. These findings, however, were not statistically significant and not exclusive to BMI&#x27;s within the overweight and obese range. Another review and meta-analysis found that women with a BMI above 25 were more likely to have RPL and more likely to have a subsequent miscarriage, although the quality of evidence was low given that most of the studies were observational. It is important to consider that BMI can be influenced by numerous other conditions and modifiable risk factors (ie. poor nutrition, activity level, diabetes), therefore should not be regarded as a direct cause of RPL.
* Stress: Research found that there is &quot;increased relative risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.57)...for women experiencing high job stress.&quot; Another research review found that the risk of miscarriage is higher for women with a &quot;history of exposure to psychological stress (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.19–1.70)&quot; However, the authors of these studies also point out that measuring stress is difficult, and that the results must therefore be interpreted with some caution. In addition, one of the studies notes that, while there are no randomized trials to study stress as it relates to pregnancy loss, one study found that a program of structured psychological support increased live birth rate among women with recurrent miscarriage.

=== Endocrine disorders ===

Women with hypothyroidism are at increased risk for pregnancy losses. Unrecognized or poorly treated diabetes mellitus leads to increased miscarriages. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome also have higher loss rates possibly related to hyperinsulinemia or excess androgens. Inadequate production of progesterone in the luteal phase may set the stage for RPL.

* Luteal phase defect: The issue of a luteal phase defect is complex. The theory behind the concept suggests that an inadequate amount of progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum to maintain the early pregnancy. Assessment of this situation was traditionally carried out by an endometrial biopsy, however recent studies have not confirmed that such assessment is valid. Studies about the value of progesterone supplementation remain deficient, however, such supplementation is commonly carried out on an empirical basis.

=== Thrombophilia ===

An important example is the possible increased risk of miscarriage in women with thrombophilia (propensity for blood clots). The most common problem is the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation. Some preliminary studies suggest that anticoagulant medication may improve the chances of carrying pregnancy to term but these studies need to be confirmed before they are adopted in clinical practice. Note that many women with thrombophilia go through one or more pregnancies with no difficulties, while others may have pregnancy complications. Thrombophilia may explain up to 49–65% of recurrent miscarriages.

=== Immune factors ===

A common feature of immune factors in causing recurrent pregnancy loss appears to be a decreased maternal immune tolerance towards the fetus.

* Antiphospholipid syndrome: The antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is a common cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. Around 15% of the women who have recurrent miscarriages have high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies. Women who have had more than one miscarriage in the first trimester, or a miscarriage in the second trimester, may have their blood tested for antibodies, to determine if they have antiphospholipid syndrome. Women diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome generally take aspirin or heparin in subsequent pregnancies, but questions remain due to the lack of high quality trials.
* Thyroid antibodies: Anti-thyroid autoantibodies are associated with an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage with an odds ratio of 2.3 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.5–3.5.
* Increased uterine NK cells: Natural killer cells, a type of white blood cell, are present in uterine tissue. High levels of these cells may be linked to RPL but high numbers or the presence of these cells is not a predictor of pregnancy loss in women who have not have had a miscarriage.
* Male-specific minor histocompatibility: Immunization of mothers against male-specific minor histocompatibility (H-Y) antigens has a pathogenic role in many cases of &quot;secondary recurrent miscarriage&quot;, that is, recurrent miscarriage in pregnancies succeeding a previous live birth. An example of this effect is that the male:female ratio of children born prior and subsequent to secondary recurrent miscarriage is 1.49 and 0.76 respectively.

=== Infection ===
There are numerous bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections that have been associated with risk of pregnancy loss, however, no direct link to recurrent pregnancy loss has been established. Infections known to increase the risk of miscarriage include bacterial vaginosis (&quot;M. hominis&quot; and &quot;U. urealyticum)&quot;, syphilis, CMV, dengue fever, malaria, brucellosis, and HIV. There is mixed evidence regarding the risk of miscarriage with &quot;Chlamydia&quot; &quot;trachomatis&quot;, HPV, Hepatitis B, &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, HSV1/HSV2, and parvovirus B19.

== Assessment ==

Transvaginal ultrasonography has become the primary method of assessment of the health of an early pregnancy.

In non-pregnant patients who are evaluated for recurrent pregnancy loss the following tests are usually performed.
Parental chromosome testing (karyogram) is generally recommended after 2 or 3 pregnancy losses. Blood tests for thrombophilia, ovarian function, thyroid function and diabetes are performed.

== Treatment ==

If the likely cause of recurrent pregnancy loss can be determined treatment is to be directed accordingly. In pregnant women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, anticoagulants seem to increase the live birth rate among those with antiphospholipid syndrome and perhaps those with congenital thrombophilia but not in those with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. One study found that in many women with chronic endometritis, &quot;fertility was restored after appropriate antibiotic treatment.&quot;

For women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, research suggests that specific antenatal counseling and psychological support may result in a higher chance of pregnancy success. Some research finds that for these patients psychological support and ultrasound in early pregnancy &quot;gives &#x27;success rates&#x27; of between 70% and 80%&quot;.

However, each additional loss worsens the prognostic for a successful pregnancy and increases the psychological and physical risks to the mother. Aspirin has no effect in preventing recurrent miscarriage in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Immunotherapy has not been found to help.

In certain chromosomal situations, while treatment may not be available, in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be able to identify embryos with a reduced risk of another pregnancy loss which then would be transferred. However, in vitro fertilization does not improve maternal-fetal tolerance imbalances.

== Psychological Impact ==
Experiencing pregnancy loss can have a significant and at times prolonged psychological impact, including higher levels of stress anxiety, and depression. There is evidence that women struggling with recurrent pregnancy loss in particular may be affected to a greater degree. Grief is a normal and expected response to the loss of a pregnancy. However, prolonged and intense grief can be significantly distressing and detrimental to the mental health of the individual. This can particularly be seen in women that developed maladaptive coping mechanisms following a miscarriage, isolated themselves as a result of the cultural and societal stigma, or received inadequate social support from medical providers, partners, families, and other personal relationships. In heterosexual couples, men also experience grief as a result of pregnancy loss and have reported feeling obligated to disregard their feelings in order to support their partner. The psychological effects of RPL on paternal emotional and mental wellbeing has not been studied extensively, however, there are emerging studies that further look into this. According to a recent meta-analysis that compared the psychological impact among men and women with a history of RPL, women were found to have higher levels of moderate to severe depression, stress, and anxiety than women without RPL and than men who experienced RPL.

Given the impact that RPL can have on the mental health and psychologic well-being of couples, mental health evaluation, anxiety/depression screening, and treatment can be considered. There is also emerging research that suggests that untreated depression and depressive symptoms can lead to adverse outcomes in future pregnancies such as preterm birth and low Apgar scores. Consequently, there has been a rise in antidepressant (ie. SSRI) use during pregnancy over the last few years with a prevalence of 1-8%. This decision should be made with the guidance of a medical provider given the teratogenicity and potential adverse effects of antidepressants on the fetus.

In addition to psychotherapy, psychological care for people experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss can include counseling and other supportive services. There is some evidence to support that women that received bereavement counseling (based on the Guidelines for Medical Professionals Providing Care to the Family Experiencing Perinatal Loss, Neonatal Death, SIDS, or other Infant Death) after pregnancy loss were able to cope better, with women reporting 50% less despair than those that did not receive this intervention.

== Prognosis ==

Recurrent miscarriage in itself is associated with later development of coronary artery disease with an odds ratio of approximately 2, increased risk of ovarian cancer, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and an increased risk of all-cause mortality of 44%, 86%, and 150% for women with a history of 1, 2, or 3 miscarriages, respectively.

Women with a history of recurrent miscarriage are at risk of developing preeclampsia in later pregnancies.

<text>All the King&#x27;s Men is a 2006 American political drama film written, directed and produced by Steven Zaillian based on the 1946 Pulitzer Prize–winning novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren. &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; had previously been adapted into a Best Picture Oscar–winning film by writer-director Robert Rossen in 1949. The film narrates the rise to power and demise of the Governor Willie Stark (played by Sean Penn), taking his office in the American South. The fictional character is loosely based on the life of Louisiana governor Huey Long, in office between 1928 through 1932. Elected as a U.S. senator, he was assassinated in 1935. The film co-stars Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley and Frederic Forrest in his final film appearance.

Produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Phoenix Pictures and Relativity Media, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; was released in the United States on September 22, 2006, by Sony Pictures Releasing.

==Plot==
Jack Burden, a Louisiana news reporter, takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer and parish treasurer. Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for governor. Burden&#x27;s upbringing makes him familiar with the undercurrent of politics – he was raised by his loving godfather Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while his good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and his sister Anne Stanton—also Burden&#x27;s former lover—are the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy&#x27;s advice and travels as a reporter on Stark&#x27;s campaign for governor.

The politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split his party&#x27;s vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to him by Duffy. His vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for his &quot;fellow ignorant hicks&quot;, resulting in Stark winning the election. He manages Duffy by making him his lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for him as an adviser.

Stark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of his new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible graft in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite&#x27;s word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells his crowds that his &quot;crooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty&quot; compared to the elite&#x27;s. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while he begins having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke&#x27;s jealousy and Burden&#x27;s disappointment.

Irwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a bribe that Irwin used to get his appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin himself commits suicide. Burden&#x27;s mother then tells him that Irwin treated him with such love because he was his biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden.

Stark utilizes many methods of corruption to consolidate his power, including patronage and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing him in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when he learns of Stark&#x27;s affair with his sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor&#x27;s bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.

==Cast==

==Production==
Filming took place in New Orleans, Morgan City, Donaldsonville, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge and many other places in Louisiana.

The film garnered strong Oscar &quot;buzz&quot; and was considered a contender by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; even before its initial opening.

The world premiere was held at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2006, where the film was first screened to the press. A special screening was held at the Tulane University in New Orleans on September 16, 2006.

==Reception==
===Box office ===
&quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; grossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $9.5 million, against a production budget of $50 million.

In the film&#x27;s opening weekend it made $3.7 million from 1,514 theaters, finishing seventh. It then dropped to 11th place with a gross of $1.5 million in its second weekend, and by its third weekend fell to 27th place with $285,993.

=== Critical response ===

In spite of its high-profile cast, direction and production team, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; was a massive failure, both with critics and at the box office. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds approval rating of 12% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 4.30/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;With a scenery-chewing performance from Sean Penn, an absence of political insight, and an overall lack of narrative cohesiveness, these &quot;Men&quot; give Oscar bait a bad name.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressed disappointment with the film: &quot;Nothing in the picture works. It is both overwrought and tedious, its complicated narrative bogging down in lyrical voiceover, long flashbacks and endless expository conversations between people speaking radically incompatible accents.&quot; Michael Medved gave &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; two stars (out of four) calling it &quot;depressing and disappointing&quot;, a &quot;stodgy melodrama&quot; and a &quot;pointless, pretentious, plodding period-piece&quot;.

Richard Roeper also gave the film a less than stellar review. Michael Phillips put it on his Worst of 2006 list.

Some reviews were positive. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine liked the movie, arguing that &quot;it&#x27;s much more faithful to the tone of the novel&quot; than the original. Kenneth Turan (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) praised the film&#x27;s &quot;undeniable moral seriousness&quot; and the actors&#x27; &quot;exceptional ensemble work.&quot; He argued that Zaillian&#x27;s script and direction &quot;expertly extracted the core of this greatest of American political novels, a work that is both of its time and outside it.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The film was featured in Nathan Rabin&#x27;s feature for &quot;The Onion&#x27;s&quot; A.V. Club, &quot;My Year of Flops&quot;. Of three categories (failure, fiasco, or secret success), he labeled &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; as a failure and said of the film: &quot;Zaillian’s dud manages the formidable feat of being at once histrionic and agonizingly dull, hysterically over-the-top yet strangely lifeless.&quot;

Zaillian was stunned by the poor critical and box-office results of this film, which opened with only $3.8 million and barely made $7.2 million at the end of its run in US theaters. Another new wide release from the same weekend, the $11.5 million sequel &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, made $28.1 million. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Zaillian said that the film&#x27;s poor performance was &quot;like getting hit by a truck. ... I don&#x27;t know what to make of it. ... We&#x27;re all a bit shellshocked. I feel like Huey Long must have felt -- you try to do good and they shoot you for it.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by James Horner, who had previously worked with Zaillian on &quot;Searching For Bobby Fischer&quot;.

<doc id="1166098" wikidata="Q4917444" url="?curid=1166098" title="Bishop's University Students' Representative Council">
<text>The [[Bishop&#x27;s University]] Students&#x27; Representative Council is a non-profit student-run organization to which all full-time students at Bishop&#x27;s automatically belong.

&quot;The SRC is responsible for a number of services offered to students and provides a variety of both academic and non-academic clubs through which students may become directly involved in Bishop&#x27;s life. It is also responsible for several publications, including The Quad yearbook, The Mitre and the Handbook. In addition to this, the SRC is responsible for organizing events on campus, ranging from Orientation Week to the election of the valedictorian.&quot; 

==History==
One of the oldest student organizations in Canada, the Students&#x27; Executive Council of Bishop&#x27;s University was founded in 1893. 
It was renamed the Students&#x27; Representative Council following a referendum in the spring of 1979 which also re-organised the various vice-President positions, creating the VP Media Affairs to be responsible for Radio Bishop&#x27;s (later CJMQ), the Campus Newspaper, the Mitre, the Quad (yearbook) and the Student Handbook. This constitutional change also removed all club representation from the Council, the clubs being represented by the VP positions. The constitution was subsequently revised in 1983, further structuring it. Following constitutional changes in 2006, the VP portfolios were again restructured, with the Vice-President of Social Affairs taking responsibility for clubs and societies.

Over the course of a three-month internal review process in the Fall 2015 semester, a committee of SRC members worked to evaluate the SRC&#x27;s structure in an effort to improve its efficiency, productivity, inclusivity, legitimacy, transparency, and overall representation of Bishop&#x27;s students. Following a constitutional amendment, the Student Event Coordinator and Student Affairs Representative positions were replaced by General Councillors, who represent Bishop&#x27;s University students on issues relating to their portfolio.

The Bishop&#x27;s University Students&#x27; Representative Council is the official representative of all the students at Bishop&#x27;s University.

== SRC Operations ==

The Operations Department is in charge of the financial viability of the SRC. It also play a primary role in organizing Winterfest with the help of the Rail Jam coordinators. In addition to this, the General Manager of Operations ensures proper hiring protocol and effective performance of the SRC as a whole.

The SRC runs two on-campus operations: The Gait and Doolittle&#x27;s General Store. The Gait opened in 2006, and is unique in that it is run and staffed completely by full-time students. The Gait is open every Thursday and Saturday, and caters to the student population.
The SRC also owns and operates Doolittle&#x27;s General Store, the only depanneur on campus. Doolittle&#x27;s is the place to purchase beer, bus tickets, snacks, ice cream, and event tickets on campus. Doolittle&#x27;s is also run and staffed completely by students. 
Overseeing the two operations is a Director of Finance and Operations. This full-time student is hired by the SRC and is, along with the Director of Communications and Marketing and the Director of Human Resources, one of the three non-elected Directors to sit on the SRC Executive Cabinet.

== Academic Affairs ==

The Academic Affairs Department is made up of 5 Divisional Senators, overseen by the VP Academic Affairs. Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, Education, and Natural Science are each represented by one student, who carries a vote at the Academic Senate of Bishop&#x27;s University. Each of the Senators also sits on their divisional faculty meetings, as well as various sub-committees of the Senate.

==Student life==

The Student Life Department is a recent creation, stemming from a constitutional overhaul during the 2015-2016 academic year. The Vice-President of Student Life is tasked with representing students in all non-academic areas of life at university. This includes students&#x27; health, well-being, safety, and security as they go about their time at Bishop&#x27;s. The Student Life Department works closely with university administration to ensure that students&#x27; needs are met regarding student support services, dining facilities, athletics and recreation, residence, and a whole lot more. The Student Life Department also represents the student body on a number of Bishop&#x27;s University committees, including the Student Services Directors Meeting, Health and Safety, Committee on Life at the University, and the Alcohol Concerns Committee. The department manages all social, cultural, academic, religious, and charity clubs.

<text>Microsoft codenames are given by Microsoft to products it has in development before these products are given the names by which they appear on store shelves. Many of these products (new versions of Windows in particular) are of major significance to the IT community, and so the terms are often widely used in discussions before the official release. Microsoft usually does not announce a final name until shortly before the product is publicly available. It is not uncommon for Microsoft to reuse codenames a few years after a previous usage has been abandoned.

There has been some suggestion that Microsoft may move towards defining the real name of their upcoming products earlier in the product development lifecycle to avoid needing product codenames.

<doc id="1166117" wikidata="Q1645997" url="?curid=1166117" title="Lycidas">
<text>&quot;Lycidas&quot; () is a poem by John Milton, written in 1637 as a pastoral elegy. It first appeared in a 1638 collection of elegies, &quot;Justa Edouardo King Naufrago&quot;, dedicated to the memory of Edward King, a friend of Milton at Cambridge who drowned when his ship sank in the Irish Sea off the coast of Wales in August 1637. The poem is 193 lines in length and is irregularly rhymed. Many of the other poems in the compilation are in Greek and Latin, but &quot;Lycidas&quot; is one of the poems written in English. Milton republished the poem in 1645.

==History of the name Lycidas==
Herodotus in his Book IX (written in the 5th century BC) mentions an Athenian councilor in Salamis, &quot;a man named Lycidas&quot; (), who proposed to his fellow citizens that they submit to a compromise offered by their enemy, Persian King Xerxes I, with whom they were at war. Suspected of collusion with the enemy for suggesting the compromise, Lycidas was stoned to death by &quot;those in the council and those outside, [who] were so enraged... [W]ith all the uproar in Salamis over Lycidas, the Athenian women soon found out what had happened; whereupon, without a word from the men, they got together, and, each one urging on her neighbor and taking her along with the crowd, flocked to Lycidas&#x27; house and stoned his wife and children.&quot;

The name later occurs in Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Idylls&quot;, where Lycidas is most prominently a poet-goatherd encountered on the trip of &quot;Idyll vii.&quot; The name appears several times in Virgil and is a typically Doric shepherd&#x27;s name, appropriate for the pastoral mode. A Lycidas appears in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; as a centaur.

Lycidas also occurs in Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, where in iii.636 a sailor named Lycidas is ripped by an iron hook from the deck of a ship.

==&quot;Lycidas&quot; as pastoral elegy==

By naming Edward King &quot;Lycidas,&quot; Milton follows &quot;the tradition of memorializing a loved one through Pastoral poetry, a practice that may be traced from ancient Greek Sicily through Roman culture and into the Christian Middle Ages and early Renaissance.&quot; Milton describes King as &quot;selfless,&quot; even though he was of the clergy – a statement both bold and, at the time, controversial among lay people: &quot;Through allegory, the speaker accuses God of unjustly punishing the young, selfless King, whose premature death ended a career that would have unfolded in stark contrast to the majority of the ministers and bishops of the Church of England, whom the speaker condemns as depraved, materialistic, and selfish.&quot;

Authors and poets in the Renaissance used the pastoral mode in order to represent an ideal of life in a simple, rural landscape. Literary critics have emphasized the artificial character of pastoral nature: &quot;The pastoral was in its very origin a sort of toy, literature of make-believe.&quot; Milton himself &quot;recognized the pastoral as one of the natural modes of literary expression,&quot; employing it throughout &quot;Lycidas&quot; in order to achieve a strange juxtaposition between death and the remembrance of a loved one.

The poem itself begins with a pastoral image of laurels and myrtles, &quot;symbols of poetic fame; as their berries are not yet ripe, the poet is not yet ready to take up his pen&quot;. However, the speaker is so filled with sorrow for the death of Lycidas that he finally begins to write an elegy. &quot;Yet the untimely death of young Lycidas requires equally untimely verses from the poet. Invoking the muses of poetic inspiration, the shepherd-poet takes up the task, partly, he says, in hope that his own death will not go unlamented.&quot; The speaker continues by recalling the life of the young shepherds together &quot;in the &#x27;pastures&#x27; of Cambridge.&quot; Milton uses the pastoral idiom to allegorize experiences he and King shared as fellow students at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The university is represented as the &quot;self-same hill&quot; upon which the speaker and Lycidas were &quot;nurst&quot;; their studies are likened to the shepherds&#x27; work of &quot;dr[iving] a field&quot; and &quot;Batt’ning… flocks&quot;; classmates are &quot;Rough satyrs&quot; and &quot;fauns with clov’n heel&quot; and the dramatic and comedic pastimes they pursued are &quot;Rural ditties… / Temper’ed to th&#x27; oaten flute&quot;; a Cambridge professor is &quot;old Damoetas [who] lov’d to hear our song&quot;. The poet then notes the &quot;&#x27;heavy change&#x27; suffered by nature now that Lycidas is gone—a ‘pathetic fallacy’ in which the willows, hazel groves, woods, and caves lament Lycidas&#x27;s death.&quot; In the next section of the poem, &quot;The shepherd-poet reflects… that thoughts of how Lycidas might have been saved are futile… turning from lamenting Lycidas’s death to lamenting the futility of all human labor.&quot; This section is followed by an interruption in the swain&#x27;s monologue by the voice of Phoebus, &quot;the sun-god, an image drawn out of the mythology of classical Roman poetry, [who] replies that fame is not mortal but eternal, witnessed by Jove (God) himself on judgment day.&quot; At the end of the poem, King/Lycidas appears as a resurrected figure, being delivered, through the resurrecting power of Christ, by the waters that lead to his death: &quot;Burnished by the sun&#x27;s rays at dawn, King resplendently ascends heavenward to his eternal reward.&quot;

Although on its surface &quot;Lycidas&quot; reads like a straightforward pastoral elegy, a closer reading reveals its complexity. &quot;Lycidas&quot; has been called &quot;&#x27;probably the most perfect piece of pure literature in existence…’ [employing] patterns of structure, prosody, and imagery to maintain a dynamic coherence. The syntax of the poem is full of &#x27;impertinent auxiliary assertions&#x27; that contribute valuably to the experience of the poem.&quot; The piece itself is remarkably dynamic, enabling many different styles and patterns to overlap, so that &quot;the loose ends of any one pattern disappear into the interweavings of the others.&quot;

&quot;Lycidas&quot; also has its detractors, including 18th-century literary critic and polymath Samuel Johnson, who infamously called the pastoral form &quot;easy, vulgar, and therefore disgusting,&quot; and said of Milton&#x27;s elegy:

It is not to be considered as the effusion of real passion; for passion runs not after remote allusions and obscure opinions. Passion plucks no berries from the myrtle and ivy, nor calls upon Arethuse and Mincius, nor tells of rough satyrs and fauns with cloven heel. Where there is leisure for fiction there is little grief.

Johnson was reacting to what he saw as the irrelevance of the pastoral idiom in Milton&#x27;s age and his own, and to its ineffectiveness at conveying genuine emotion. Johnson said that conventional pastoral images—for instance, the representation of the speaker and the deceased as shepherds—were &quot;long ago exhausted,&quot; and so improbable that they &quot;always forc[e] dissatisfaction on the mind.&quot; Johnson also criticized the blending of Christian and pagan images and themes in &quot;Lycidas,&quot; which he saw as the poem&#x27;s &quot;grosser fault.&quot; He said &quot;Lycidas&quot; positions the &quot;trifling fictions&quot; of &quot;heathen deities—Jove and Phoebus, Neptune and Æolus&quot; alongside &quot;the most awful and sacred truths, such as ought never to be polluted with such irreverend combinations.

Johnson concluded: &quot;Surely no man could have fancied that he read Lycidas with pleasure had he not known its author.&quot;

== The Uncouth Swain ==

Though commonly considered to be a monody, &quot;Lycidas&quot; in fact features two distinct voices, the first of which belongs to the uncouth swain (or shepherd). The work opens with the swain, who finds himself grieving for the death of his friend, Lycidas, in an idyllic pastoral world. In his article entitled &quot;Belief and Disbelief in Lycidas,&quot; Lawrence W. Hyman states that the swain is experiencing a &quot;loss of faith in a world order that allows death to strike a young man.&quot; Similarly, Lauren Shohet asserts that the swain is projecting his grief upon the classical images of the pastoral setting at this point in the elegy.

Throughout the poem, the swain uses both Christian and Pagan concepts, and mentally locates Lycidas&#x27; body in both settings, according to Russel Fraser. Examples of this are the mention of Death as an animate being, the &quot;Sisters of the Sacred Well,&quot; Orpheus, the blind Fury that struck Lycidas down, and the scene in which Lycidas is imagined to have become a regional deity (a &quot;genius of the shore&quot;) after drowning. Since Lycidas, like King, drowned, there is no body to be found, and the absence of the corpse is of great concern to the swain.

Ultimately, the swain&#x27;s grief and loss of faith are conquered by a &quot;belief in immortality.&quot; Many scholars have pointed out that there is very little logical basis within the poem for this conclusion, but that a reasonable process is not necessary for &quot;Lycidas&quot; to be effective. Fraser will argue that Milton&#x27;s voice intrudes briefly upon the swain&#x27;s to tell a crowd of fellow swains that Lycidas is not in fact dead (here one sees belief in immortality). This knowledge is inconsistent with the speaker&#x27;s &quot;uncouth&quot; character.

== The Pilot ==

Upon entering the poem at line 109, the voice of the &quot;Pilot of the Galilean lake,&quot; generally believed to represent St. Peter, serves as a judge, condemning the multitude of unworthy members found among the clergy of the Church of England. Similarly, St. Peter fills the position of Old Testament prophet when he speaks of the clergy&#x27;s &quot;moral decay&quot; and the grave consequences of their leadership. He then compares these immoral church leaders to wolves among sheep and warns of the &quot;two-handed engine&quot;. According to E. S. de Beer, this &quot;two-handed engine&quot; is thought to be a powerful weapon and an allusion to a portion of the Book of Zechariah.

Concerning St. Peter&#x27;s role as a &quot;prophet,&quot; the term is meant in the Biblical sense, de Beer claims, and not in the more modern sense of the word. Since Biblical prophets more often served as God&#x27;s messengers than as seers, de Beer states that Milton was not attempting to foretell the likely future of the church via St. Peter.

De Beer continues on to note that St. Peter&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Lycidas&quot; is likely unrelated to his position as head of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither was St. Peter ascribed any particular position within the Church of England. Instead, de Beer argues that St. Peter appears simply as an apostolic authority, through whom Milton might express his frustration with unworthy members of the English clergy. Fraser also agrees that St. Peter, indeed, serves as a vehicle for Milton&#x27;s voice to enter the poem.

The Church was so thrown off by the poem that they banned it for nearly twenty years after Milton&#x27;s death.

==The conclusion==
Several interpretations of the ending have been proposed. Jonathan Post claims the poem ends with a sort of retrospective picture of the poet having &quot;sung&quot; the poem into being. According to critic Lauren Shohet, Lycidas is transcendently leaving the earth, becoming immortal, rising from the pastoral plane in which he is too involved or tangled from the objects that made him. She claims that &quot;he is diffused into, and animates, the last location of his corpse—his experience of body-as-object… neither fully immanent (since his body is lost) nor fully transcendent (since he remains on earth).&quot;

With an ambiguous ending, the poem does not just end with a death, but instead, it just begins. The monody clearly ends with a death and an absolute end but also moves forward and comes full circle because it takes a look back at the pastoral world left behind making the ambivalence of the end a mixture of creation and destruction. Nonetheless &quot;thy large recompense&quot; also has a double meaning. As Paul Alpers states, Lycidias&#x27; gratitude in heaven is a payment for his loss. The word &quot;thy&quot; is both an object and mediator of &quot;large recompense.&quot; Thus, the meaning also maintains the literal meaning which is that of a sacred higher being or the pagan genius.

The final lines of the poem:

:And now the Sun had stretch&#x27;d out all the hills,
:And now was dropt into the Western bay;
:At last he rose, and twitch&#x27;d his Mantle blew:
:To morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new
may refer to Milton&#x27;s imminent departure to Italy, and they are reminiscent of the end of Virgil&#x27;s 10th &quot;Eclogue&quot;,

==&quot;Justa Edouardo King Naufrago&quot;==
&quot;Lycidas&quot; was originally published in a poetic miscellany alongside thirty-five other poems elegizing the death of Edward King. Collected at Cambridge, most of the poems were written by academics at the university who were committed to the conservative church politics of Archbishop Laud. Among the poets were John Cleveland, Joseph Beaumont, and Henry More. Milton, on the other hand, who reported that he had been &quot;Church-outed by the prelates,&quot; had failed to achieve a position at Cambridge after his graduation, and his religious views were becoming more radical. The style and form of his poem also strongly contrasts from the other texts in the collection. While most of the poetry adopts a baroque aesthetic linked to the Laudian ceremonialism that was in vogue in the 1630s, Milton wrote &quot;Lycidas&quot; in the outmoded pastoral style. &quot;Lycidas&quot; may actually be satirizing the poetic work featured throughout the &quot;Justa Edouardo King Naufrago&quot;.

==1645 reprint==
Milton republished the poem in his 1645 collection &quot;Poems of Mr. John Milton&quot;. To this version is added a brief prose preface:
: In this MONODY the Author bewails a learned Friend, unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas, 1637. And by occasion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy, then in their height.

When Milton published this version, in 1645, the Long Parliament, to which Milton held allegiance, was in power; thus Milton could add the prophetic note—in hindsight—about the destruction of the &quot;corrupted clergy,&quot; the &quot;blind mouths&quot; (119) of the poem.

==Influence==
The poem was exceedingly popular. It was hailed as Milton&#x27;s best poem, and by some as the greatest lyrical poem in the English language. Yet it was detested for its artificiality by Samuel Johnson, who found &quot;the diction is harsh, the rhymes uncertain, and the numbers unpleasing&quot; and complained that &quot;in this poem there is no nature, for there is no truth; there is no art, for there is nothing new.&quot;

A line from the poem inspired the title and themes in &quot;Stops of Various Quills&quot;, an 1895 poetry collection by William Dean Howells. Similarly, it is from a line in &quot;Lycidas&quot; that Thomas Wolfe took the name of his novel &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;:

:Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth:
:And, O ye Dolphins&#x27;, waft the hapless youth. (163–164)

The title of Howard Spring&#x27;s 1940 political novel &quot;Fame is the Spur&quot; takes its title from the poem, as does &quot;The Sheep Look Up&quot; by John Brunner which is taken from line 125.

The title of the short story &quot;Wash Far Away&quot; by John Berryman from the collection &quot;Freedom of the Poet&quot; is also taken from this poem:

:Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding Seas
:Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurld, (154–155)

The song &quot;The Alphabet Business Concern (Home of Fadeless Splendour)&quot;, from the album &quot;Heaven Born and Ever Bright&quot; (1992) by Cardiacs, contains the lines:Comes the blind Fury with th&#x27;abhorred shears

And slits the thin spun life. (75–76)

<text>John Jeffrey Leal (born December 13, 1954) is a Canadian politician who serves as the 63rd and current mayor of Peterborough. Previously, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the riding of Peterborough. He served in the cabinet of Kathleen Wynne. On October 24, 2022 he was elected mayor of Peterborough.

==Background==
John Jeffrey Leal was born and raised in Peterborough. He attended Kenner Collegiate and has a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in Economics and Political Science from Trent University (1978) and a degree in Business Administration from the University of Windsor (1981). Leal worked as executive assistant to members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) John Eakins and Larry South in the 1980s. He was a health and safety representative for Coyle Corrugated Containers. He is married to Karan, a teacher and school principal, with two children, Braden and Shanae.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
He served on the Peterborough City Council from 1985 to 2003, representing the Otonabee Ward. At City Hall he was appointed as Deputy Mayor (1993-2003) and chaired the social services committee after the 2000 municipal election. In July 2022, Leal announced his candidacy for mayor of Peterborough, which he would later win.
===Provincial===
Leal ran for provincial office in the 1999 provincial election as the Liberal candidate. He was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Gary Stewart. He defeated Stewart by over six thousand votes in a 2003 rematch, amid a provincial shift to the Liberal Party. Leal was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2014.

During his time in government, he has served as Parliamentary Assistant to several ministers including Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (2004), Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (2005), Ministry of Energy (2005), Ministry of the Environment (2006), and the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (2007–09). In February 2010, he was named the Chief Government Whip.

In February 2013, Premier Kathleen Wynne named Leal to Ontario&#x27;s Cabinet, serving in the role as Minister of Rural Affairs.

Leal has helped secure over $400 million in funding for Peterborough, creating and preserving over 3,700 jobs with investments in infrastructure, transportation, businesses and health care. This included the creation of a new hospital, Peterborough Regional Health Centre, and funding following a damaging flood in 2004.

Leal has championed a number of issues through private member&#x27;s bills, including retirement and income security measures. He introduced a private member&#x27;s bill in 2008 to provide creditor protection for Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs). Two years later, he introduced a separate bill that would require companies with twenty or more employees to offer a savings or pension plan that all employees would automatically join (with the ability to opt out). The stated purpose of this bill, which was supported by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, was to reduce the costs of such insurance plans compared with retail mutual funds.

In June 2014, Leal was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Food and Rural Affairs.

<doc id="1166131" wikidata="Q707056" url="?curid=1166131" title="Tapti River">
<text>The Tapti River (or Tapi) is a river in central India located to the south of the Narmada river that flows westwards before draining into the Arabian Sea. The river has a length of around and flows through the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It flows through the city of Surat, in Gujarat, and is crossed by the Magdalla, ONGC Bridge.
On 7 August 1968, before the construction of the Ukai Dam to bring its waters under control and provide hydroelectric power, the Tapti River overflowed its banks during heavy rains in the monsoon season. More than 1,000 people drowned in the flood, and the city of Surat was submerged beneath 10 feet of water for several days. After the floodwaters receded, at least 1,000 more people died in Gujarat during a cholera epidemic from the contamination of the drinking water. The Tapti basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

== Course ==
The Tapti River rises in Multai, in Madhya Pradesh, and with a total length of 724 km is the second longest west-flowing river in India, after the Narmada River. The Tapti travels east to west and flows through the Indian states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It drains into the Gulf of Khambhat, in the Arabian Sea, in Gujarat. The Tapti River has 14 major tributaries, four are right bank and ten are left bank tributaries. The right bank tributaries originate in the Satpura ranges and include Vaki, Aner, Arunawati, and Gomai. The left bank tributaries include Nesu, Amravati, Buray, Panjhara, Bori, Girna, Waghur, Purna, Mona, and Sipna. They originate in the Gawilgarh hills, Ajanta hills, the Western Ghats, and Satmalas.

==Etymology==
The river is supposedly named after the goddess Tapati, the daughter of Surya, the Sun god and Chhaya. Tapati is the sister of Shani, Bhadra, Yamuna and Yama.

<text>Gwendolynne Sophia Moore (born April 18, 1951) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 2005. In 2016, Moore was elected to serve as caucus whip of the Congressional Black Caucus for the 115th United States Congress. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Her district is based in Milwaukee and as a result of the 2011 redistricting also includes some Milwaukee County suburbs: Bayside, Brown Deer, Cudahy, Fox Point, Glendale, St. Francis, South Milwaukee, West Milwaukee, Shorewood, and Whitefish Bay. Moore is the first woman to represent the district and the second woman after Tammy Baldwin and the first African American elected to Congress from Wisconsin.

Moore is currently Wisconsin&#x27;s longest serving Representative, after Representative Ron Kind retired, in 2023.

==Early life, education and career==
Moore was born in Racine, but has spent most of her life in Milwaukee. She is the eighth of nine children; her father was a factory worker and her mother a public school teacher. Moore attended North Division High School and served as student council president. She later attended Marquette University and became a single mother and welfare recipient. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1973.

As an organizer with AmeriCorps VISTA, Moore worked to establish the Cream City Community Development Credit Union to offer grants and loans to low-income residents to start businesses. For her work, she was awarded the national &quot;VISTA Volunteer of the Decade&quot; award from 1976 to 1986. From 1985 to 1989, she worked for the City of Milwaukee as a neighborhood development strategist and for the state Department of Employment Relations and Health and Social Services. Moore also worked for the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) as a housing officer.

==Wisconsin legislature==
Moore was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1988 and served two terms representing the 7th district. She was a prominent voice calling for an investigation into the case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who lived two blocks from Moore.

In 1992, Moore was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, in which she represented the 4th district from 1993 to 2005. She was the first African-American woman to be elected to the state senate and became a prominent voice against mandatory ID security measures to enter the Capitol. She said, &quot;I am too often reminded [9/11 hijacker] Mohammed Atta had a photo ID. This will not tell people whether I am a terrorist. This disenfranchises people who come to their Capitol.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Moore was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004 with 69.6% of the vote, defeating Republican attorney Gerald Boyle. She was one of a handful of African Americans to be elected to Congress as freshmen in 2004, and the first African American and second woman (after Tammy Baldwin) to represent Wisconsin in Congress.

Moore is a prominent advocate for women&#x27;s rights, releasing frequent statements on topics ranging from domestic abuse awareness to abortion rights. In January 2011, she was elected Democratic co-chair of the Congressional Women&#x27;s Caucus to become a leader on health insurance reform and the protection of reproductive rights. She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

During the congressional debate in February 2011 on the Pence Amendment to defund Planned Parenthood, in response to comments from Paul Broun suggesting that Planned Parenthood promoted racist eugenics because more black women than white women have abortions, Moore spoke about her experience raising children on little money, and why &quot;&quot;planned parenthood&quot; is healthy for women, it&#x27;s healthy for children and it&#x27;s healthy for our society&quot;. She publicly opposed the investigation into Planned Parenthood&#x27;s financial accounting, saying the investigation was &quot;an unfortunate waste of taxpayer dollars&quot;. Moore voted &quot;nay&quot; on Amends Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to Prohibit Abortion Coverage on October 13, 2011. In March 2012, during the House debate over reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, she spoke about her experience of being sexually assaulted and raped as a child and an adult, criticizing the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that voted &quot;no&quot; on the bill.

In the first session of the 109th Congress, Moore earned 90% and higher legislative agenda approval scores from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, and the Service Employees International Union. She has focused legislatively on traditional Democratic and progressive issues, believing that the federal government should play a significant role in the amelioration of poverty and the resolution of difficult local problems. Moore has received support from interest groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (93%), The Human Rights Campaign (100%), The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) (100%), The National Farmers Union (100%) and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (100%). She lacks support from those supporting hunting and sportsmen rights (0% support from Sportsmen&#x27;s and Animal Owners&#x27; Voting Alliance), opponents of abortion rights (0% support from National Right to Life), and conservative tax reform stances (0% support from Americans for Tax Reform).

During her first term, Moore introduced legislation to provide economic incentives and tax cuts to small businesses to promote job creation, and also cosponsored legislation supporting community block grants, continuing and expanding Medicaid funding, amending the Truth in Lending Act to prevent so-called &quot;predatory lending&quot;, and removing troops from Iraq. She also cosponsored two prospective amendments to the US Constitution, providing for uniform national election standards and prohibiting gender discrimination.

On May 6, 2006, Moore and eight fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus were arrested and ticketed for unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct after they stepped onto the grounds of the Embassy of Sudan to call attention to the ongoing Darfur conflict. Moore said the group expected to be arrested but that they were pleased to participate in a &quot;peaceful act of civil disobedience&quot;.

In July 2019, Moore voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider opposing efforts to boycott the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398-17. Moore chose not to attend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s address to the U.S. Congress in July 2024 to protest the Gaza-Israel conflict.

On December 18, 2019, Moore voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

In 2023, Moore was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

Moore was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

==Personal life==
Moore&#x27;s son, Supreme Moore Omokunde (then known as Sowande Ajumoke Omokunde), was arrested in connection with the November 2, 2004, tire-slashing of Republican Party vehicles in Milwaukee. He was charged on January 24, 2005, with a felony in connection with the event, but agreed on January 20, 2006, to plead no contest in exchange for a sentencing recommendation of restitution and probation. On April 26, 2006, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Michael B. Brennan disregarded the sentencing recommendation and sentenced Omokunde to four months in prison and $2,305 in fines and restitution. In response, Moore said, &quot;I love my son very much. I&#x27;m very proud of him. He&#x27;s accepted responsibility.&quot;

Omokunde went on to become a member of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors in 2015, and was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2020.

Moore has become a U.S. delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Moore attended the 2016 Democratic National Convention as a superdelegate, pledging her support to nominee Hillary Clinton.

Moore spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which was centered in Milwaukee.

On December 28, 2020, Moore announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and was self-isolating from others. She traveled to Washington to vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House after announcing that her quarantine period had ended.

Moore is a Baptist.

<doc id="1166157" wikidata="Q260812" url="?curid=1166157" title="G7 howitzer">
<text>The G7 is a South African 105 mm howitzer, produced by Denel Land Systems (DLS). With a maximum range of it outranges all existing 105 mm howitzers, as well as most current 155 mm howitzers (Denel&#x27;s own 155&#x27;s not included). During development, it was known as the &quot;Light Experimental Ordnance&quot; (LEO), with the G7 label being chosen later to fit in with Denel&#x27;s two existing howitzer products, the G5 towed 155 mm howitzer and the G6 self-propelled 155 mm howitzer.

==Potential customers==
In 2004, DLS partnered with General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to offer the gun in self-propelled form to the United States Army. GDLS provided an armoured vehicle (the LAV III), while Denel provided a G7 mounted inside a specially-designed, unmanned turret. The combined system weighs only when fully loaded with ammunition, making it light enough to be transportable inside a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The combination took part in a number of tests for the US Army. Though currently unfunded, the US Army has indicated a requirement for such a system to equip its Stryker Brigade. The Strykers cannot use current self-propelled and towed howitzers as their weight is a limiting factor on the brigade&#x27;s mobility.

Interest in the system has also been exhibited by the militaries of South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. In addition, the United States Army (USA) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) have exhibited interest in the towed version as a possible replacement for their towed 105 mm howitzer stocks.

In parallel with the G7&#x27;s testing on the LAV-III Denel is also planning to fit it and its turret to a Rooikat armoured vehicle for its offer to the South African Army.

==AMLAGC==
In April 2007, it was reported that Armscor, the South African defence procurements agency, was about to award Denel a contract to develop a more advanced version of the G7, to be dubbed the Advanced Multirole Light Artillery Gun Capability (AMLAGC). Under the proposed contract, the G7 would see a &quot;significant increase&quot; in capability, including a weight reduction to or less and the development of V-LAP ammunition to boost the range to .

<text>António Emílio Leite Couto, better known as Mia Couto (born 5 July 1955), is a Mozambican writer. He won the Camões Prize in 2013, the most important literary award in the Portuguese language, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2014.

==Life==
===Early years===
Mia Couto was born in the city of Beira, Mozambique, the country&#x27;s third largest city, where he was also raised and schooled. He is the son of Portuguese emigrants who moved to the Portuguese colony in the 1950s. When he was 14 years old, some of his poetry was published in a local newspaper, &quot;Notícias da Beira&quot;. Three years later, in 1971, he moved to the capital Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) and began to study medicine at the University of Lourenço Marques. During this time, the anti-colonial guerrilla and political movement FRELIMO was struggling to overthrow the Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique.

===After independence of Mozambique===
In April 1974, after the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon and the overthrow of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime, Mozambique was about to become an independent republic. In 1974, FRELIMO asked Couto to suspend his studies for a year to work as a journalist for &quot;Tribuna&quot; until September 1975 and then as the director of the newly created Mozambique Information Agency (AIM). Later, he ran &quot;Tempo&quot; magazine until 1981. His first book of poems, &quot;Raiz de Orvalho&quot;, was published in 1983; it included texts aimed against the dominance of Marxist militant propaganda. Couto continued working for the newspaper &quot;Notícias&quot; until 1985 when he resigned to finish his course of study in biology.

==Literary works and recognition==
Couto is considered one of the most important writers in Mozambique; his works have been published in more than 20 countries and in various languages. In many of his texts, he undertakes to recreate the Portuguese language by infusing it with regional vocabulary and structures from Mozambique, thus producing a new model for the African narrative. Stylistically, his writing is influenced by magical realism, a movement popular in modern Latin American literatures, and his use of language is reminiscent of the Brazilian writer João Guimarães Rosa, but also deeply influenced by the baiano writer Jorge Amado. He has been noted for creating proverbs, sometimes known as &quot;improverbs&quot;, in his fiction, as well as riddles, legends, and metaphors, giving his work a poetic dimension.

An international jury at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair named his first novel, &quot;Sleepwalking Land&quot;, one of the best 12 African books of the 20th century. In 2007, he became the first African author to win the prestigious Latin Union literary prize, which has been awarded annually in Italy since 1990. Mia Couto became only the fourth writer in the Portuguese language to take home this prestigious award. Currently, he is a biologist employed by the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park while continuing his work on other writing projects.

In 1998, Couto was elected into the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the first African writer to receive such an honour.

<doc id="1166223" wikidata="Q431989" url="?curid=1166223" title="Noémia de Sousa">
<text>Carolina Noémia Abranches de Sousa Soares, known as Noémia de Sousa (20 September 1926 – 4 December 2002), was a poet from Mozambique who wrote in the Portuguese language. She was also known as Vera Micaia. She was of mixed Portuguese and Bantu descent. De Sousa&#x27;s poetry and involvement in Moçambicanidade was a large part of the anti-colonial literary movement of Mozambique.

==Life ==
Noémia de Sousa was born of mixed-race heritage in Catembe, on the south side of the bay across from the Mozambican capital Lourenço Marques. Her father was a descended from a Luso-Afro-Indian family from the island of Mozambique; her maternal grandfather was German. Her father taught her to read at the age of four, four years before he died.

De Sousa wrote often in her early years but did not publish her work until the age of 22 in 1948. From that year on, she published her work frequently for the next three years.

Moving to Portugal by the age of 25, de Sousa lived in Lisbon, working as a translator from 1951 to 1964. She then left for Paris, where she worked for the local consulate of Morocco. She went back to Lisbon in 1975 and became a member of the ANOP.

She worked with several newspapers and magazines throughout her life. Some of her most notable collaborations were with &quot;Mensagem&quot; (CEI); &quot;Mensagem&quot; (Luanda); &quot;Itinerário&quot;; &quot;Notícias do Bloqueio&quot; (Porto, 1959); &quot;O Brado Africano&quot;; &quot;Moçambique 58&quot;; &quot;Vértice&quot; (Coimbra), &quot;Sul&quot; (Brazil).

== Writing career ==
In the early 1950s de Sousa became involved in the Moçambicanidade movement. During this period anti-colonial literature in Mozambique was at its peak and de Sousa was one of many Mozambican women writers active in the resistance. One of de Sousa&#x27;s initial contributions to the movement was sharing her literary works with news outlets that supported the resistance. De Sousa wrote an impactful poem, &quot;Poema para uma Infância Distante,&quot; that was published in a resistance news publication. This prominent literary work was one that played an immense role in the spread of cultural identity and awareness in the Moçambicanidade movement.

=== Moçambicanidade ===
Moçambicanidade was the name for a new and revolutionary literature that spread throughout Mozambique during the 1940s and 1950s. The literate culture of Mozambique shifted its focus from European styles to Mozambican cultural awareness, anti-colonialism, and political activism. This literary movement was an open platform for the citizens of Mozambique to open dialogue on issues concerning race, class, and politics. Both men and women were involved in this revolutionary literary movement.

The three major journals in support of and associated with Moçambicanidade were, &quot;O Brado Africano&quot;, &quot;Itinerário&quot;, and &quot;Msabo&quot;.

Noémia de Sousa was regularly published in &quot;O Brado Africano&quot;, and from 1949 she organized, directed, and edited the women&#x27;s columns until she left for Portugal in 1951. During de Sousa&#x27;s time at &quot;O Brado Africano&quot;, she focused the conversation on African identity, black pride, and indigenous feminism. She often published her work under the name, Vera Micaia.
