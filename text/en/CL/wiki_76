<text>Mastercard Maestro is a brand of debit cards and prepaid cards owned by Mastercard that was introduced in 1991. Maestro is accepted at around fifteen million point of sale outlets in 93 countries. 

On July 1, 2023, Mastercard began phasing out Maestro across Europe. European banks and other card issuers are now required to replace expired or lost Maestro cards with a different card.

== Functionality ==
Maestro debit cards are obtained from associate banks and are linked to the cardholder&#x27;s savings account, current account or any of several other types of accounts, while prepaid cards do not require a bank account to operate. Maestro cards can be used at point of sale (POS) and ATMs. Payments are made by swiping cards through the payment terminal, insertion into a chip and PIN device or by a contactless reader. The payment is authorized by the card issuer to ensure that the cardholder has sufficient funds in their account to make the purchase. The cardholder then confirms the payment by either signing the sales receipt or entering their 4- to 6-digit PIN, except with contactless transactions below a specified amount for which no further verification is required.

Maestro often requires on-line electronic authorization for every transaction, although Mastercard&#x27;s rules permit the establishment of floor limits on Maestro EMV chip transactions only. Not only must the information stored in either the chip or the magnetic stripe be read, but this has to be sent from the merchant to the issuing bank, the issuing bank then has to respond with an affirmative authorization. If the information is not read, the issuer will decline the transaction, regardless of any disposable amount on the connected account, except in the Asia Pacific region, where manual keyed entry is permitted under some circumstances. This is different from most other debit and credit cards, where the information can be entered manually into the terminal (i.e. by typing the 13 to 19 digits and the expiry date on the terminal) and still be approved by the issuer or stand-in processor. In most countries, other than those specified in Mastercard&#x27;s rules, a PIN rather than a signature is always required to authorise a Maestro transaction, except where no CVM (Cardholder Verification Method) is required.

==Early life and family==
Falloon was born in Masterton on 17 February 1942, the son of Margaret Falloon (née Woodhead) and Douglas John Falloon. He was educated at Lindisfarne College and Massey University, graduating with a diploma in sheep farm management.

Falloon had three children with his wife Philippa. His cousin, Ian Falloon, was one of the first psychiatrists to have family involved in the treatment of schizophrenia.

==Member of Parliament==



He was first elected to Parliament in the Pahiatua by-election of 1977, replacing Sir Keith Holyoake who had been appointed Governor-General. He retained his seat until he retired.

He held a number of ministerial posts, first in the government of Robert Muldoon, including Postmaster-General, Minister of Statistics, Minister in charge of the Inland Revenue Department and Associate Minister of Finance.

In the government of Jim Bolger, Falloon had posts including Minister of Agriculture, Minister for Forestry, Minister of Friendly Societies, and was the first Minister of Racing.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Falloon was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1997 New Year Honours, Falloon was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services.

==Later life==
After resigning from Parliament at the 1996 election, Falloon worked with at-risk children and pursued business interests, such as becoming chairman of Wairarapa winery &quot;Lintz Estate&quot;.

He had been ill for several weeks after undergoing surgery in Wellington Hospital for a brain tumour and died at his home in Bideford, near Masterton, New Zealand, in 2005.

<doc id="1181401" wikidata="Q3109232" url="?curid=1181401" title="Military Keynesianism">
<text>Military Keynesianism is an economic policy based on the position that government should raise military spending to boost economic growth. It is a fiscal stimulus policy as advocated by John Maynard Keynes. But where Keynes advocated increasing public spending on socially useful items (infrastructure in particular), additional public spending is allocated to the arms industry, the area of defense being that over which the executive exercises greater discretionary power. Typical examples of such policies are Nazi Germany, or the United States during and after World War II, during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. This type of economy is linked to the interdependence between welfare and warfare states, in which the latter feeds the former, in a potentially unlimited spiral. The term is often used pejoratively to refer to politicians who apparently reject Keynesian economics, but use Keynesian arguments in support of excessive military spending.

==Keynesian economics and application==

The most direct economic criticism of military Keynesianism maintains that government expenditures on non-military public goods such as health care, education, mass transit, and infrastructure repair create more jobs than equivalent military expenditures.

Noam Chomsky, a critic of military Keynesianism, contends that &quot;military&quot; Keynesianism offers the state advantages over &quot;non-military&quot; Keynesianism. Specifically, military Keynesianism can be implemented with less public interest and participation. &quot;Social spending may well arouse public interest and participation, thus enhancing the threat of democracy; the public cares about hospitals, roads, neighborhoods, and so on, but has no opinion about the choice of missiles and high-tech fighter planes.&quot; Essentially, when the public is less interested in the details of state spending, it affords the state increased discretion in how it spends money.

=== Nazi Germany ===
Much of the economy of the Third Reich was oriented towards militarization, especially to prepare for a possible war with the Slavic nations, rather than in the production of consumer goods or towards commercial expansion. Nevertheless, the concentration of capital in the arms industry had favored a rapid expansion of German industrial capacity and helped to reduce unemployment rates.

=== United States ===
In the United States this theory was applied during the Second World War, during the presidencies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman, the latter with the document NSC-68. The influence of Military Keynesianism on US economic policy choices lasted until the Vietnam War. Keynesians maintain that government spending should first be used for useful purposes such as infrastructure investment, but that even non-useful spending may be helpful during recessions. John Maynard Keynes advocated that government spending could be used &quot;in the interests of peace and prosperity&quot; instead of &quot;war and destruction&quot;. An example of such policies are the Public Works Administration in the 1930s in the United States.

===Keynes&#x27; 1933 letter to Roosevelt===
In 1933, John Maynard Keynes wrote an open letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging the new president to borrow money to be spent on public works programs.

=== Barney Frank ===
While the idea dates back to Keynes, a similar term is often attributed to Barney Frank, and seems to have been first used around funding the F-22 fighter:

== Forms ==
The following forms of military Keynesianism may be differentiated:
* First, there is the differentiation between the use of military spending as &#x27;pump primer&#x27;, and efforts to achieve long term multiplier effects by the given spending. A government may opt to approve the purchases of fighter planes, warships or other military commodities so as to weather a recession. Alternatively, it may opt to approve the purchase of fighter planes, warships or other military commodities throughout all the years of a given business cycle. Since the construction of large armament systems requires extensive planning and research, capitalist states generally prefer to rely on arms&#x27; purchases or other military allocations for longer-term macro-economic policymaking and regulation.
* A second differentiation that needs to be made is between primary and secondary forms of military Keynesianism. In both cases, the state uses the multiplier mechanism in order to stimulate aggregate demand in society. But the primary form of military Keynesianism refers to a situation where the state uses its military allocations as the principal means to drive the business cycle. In case of a secondary form of military Keynesianism, the given allocations contribute towards generating additional demand, but not to the extent that the economy is fully, or primarily, driven by the military allocations.
* The third differentiation starts from the observation that modern capitalist economies do not function as closed systems but rely on foreign trade and exports as outlets for the sale of a part of their surplus. This general observation applies to the surplus generated in the military sector as well. As the vast amount of data regarding state promotion of arms&#x27; exports do confirm, capitalist states actively try to ensure that their armament corporations gain access to import orders from foreign states, and they do so amongst others in order to generate multiplier effects. Hence, there is a need to also differentiate between the two forms of domestic and &#x27;externalized&#x27; military Keynesianism.

==Permanent war economy==
The concept of permanent war economy originated in 1945 with an article by Trotskyist Ed Sard (alias Frank Demby, Walter S. Oakes and T.N. Vance), a theoretician who predicted a post-war arms race. He argued at the time that the United States would retain the character of a war economy; even in peacetime, US military expenditure would remain large, reducing the percentage of unemployed compared to the 1930s. He extended this analysis in 1950 and 1951. In 1974, this idea was expanded on by Seymour Melman in the book “The Permanent War Economy: American Capitalism in Decline” where Melman describes the downside of having a permanent war economy as “sustained nonproductive use of capital and labor.” Melman goes on to observe that because this issue “is not unique to the United States” that “It is shared by all states that try to sustain permanent war economies.” Melman argues that most of the military production is unnecessary and drains the talents of highly skilled workers due to politicians attempting to create a powerful influx of jobs in their districts, and because of this, most military production is in place to create jobs instead of adding to public safety. Melman suggests that the large sum of money allocated towards unnecessary military spending would be put to better uses by maintaining or improving domestic infrastructure to have an active positive benefit to society.

== Empirical estimates ==
Many economists have attempted to estimate the multiplier effect of military expenditures with mixed results. A meta-analysis of 42 primary studies with 243 effect size, which are aggregated results from multiple studies, found that military expenditures tend to have positive effects on economic growth in developed countries but generally negative effects on growth in less developed countries. The study attributes the negative effects to the diversion of resources from productive sectors such as education and infrastructure.

== Externalities ==
Externalities are rarely if ever considered in estimating a multiplier effect. This can be a serious issue for military expenditures. For example, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) relies mostly on captured weapons. For example, in Mosul between 4 and 10 June 2014 a group of between 500 and 600 ISIL troops &quot;were able to seize six divisions&#x27; worth of strategic weaponry, all of it US-supplied&quot; from a force with a paper strength of 120,000 men. In considering the multiplier effect of military expenditures, the people killed and property destroyed are not considered. The only things that are considered are the increased weapon sales to replace those stolen and the costs associated with combatting ISIL. Those are considered as increasing the Gross Domestic Product of the United States, and that is assumed to be good.

<text>Angoville-au-Plain () is a former commune in the Manche department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Carentan-les-Marais.

It is home to a church that was used by 2 US Army Medics as an aide station during the Battle of Normandy in World War II. Robert Wright and Ken Moore of the 101st Airborne treated a mix of 80 injured American and German wounded soldiers and a child. Blood stains are still visible on the pews. Two stained glass windows commemorate the 101st Airborne Division, the first one is dedicated to the two medics of the 2nd Battalion of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (101st Airborne Division). The second one honoured the American parachutists.

<doc id="1181411" wikidata="Q171455" url="?curid=1181411" title="Ivan Capelli">
<text>Ivan Franco Capelli (born 24 May 1963) is an Italian broadcaster and former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Born and raised in Milan, Capelli began competitive kart racing aged 15. He was widely successful across lower formulae, winning titles in Italian Formula 3, FIA European Formula 3 and International Formula 3000. After making his Formula One debut with Tyrrell at the 1985 European Grand Prix, he made sporadic appearances for Tyrell and AGS before signing for March full-time in . He participated in 98 Grands Prix, achieving three podiums.

After exiting Formula One, Capelli competed in touring car racing until 2017, becoming a race-winner in the Italian GT Championship and the Trofeo Maserati. From 1998 to 2017, he was a commentator and pundit for Rai 1.

==Early life and career==
Ivan Franco Capelli was born on 24 May 1963 in Milan, Italy. Capelli began his career as a kart driver when he was 15 years old, and after four years he moved to the Italian Formula Three Championship.

In 1983 he became Italian Formula Three champion, after dominating the series with nine victories. After that, he moved with the Coloni team to the European Formula Three Championship, and here he was the champion again in 1984.

In 1985 he graduated to the European Formula 3000 Championship with a Genoa Racing March-Cosworth and won one race. After making his Formula One debut in 1985 and failing to sign a full-time contract, he contested the 1986 Formula 3000 Championship, still with Genoa Racing, and also raced a BMW in the European Touring Car Championship.

==Formula One career==
===Tyrrell and AGS (1985–1986)===
In 1985, Capelli debuted in Formula One, driving a Tyrrell at the European Grand Prix, and finished fourth in Australia. Nevertheless, he was not picked up for a full-time Formula One drive in 1986.

Despite not landing a full-time contract for 1986, Capelli started several F1 races for the AGS team. Meanwhile, Cesare Gariboldi, boss of Genoa Racing, was working with Robin Herd of March to create a new Formula One outfit. Capelli was a core component in their plans. By now, Capelli and Gariboldi had an almost father-son relationship.

===March / Leyton House (1987–1991)===

In 1987 Capelli was in Formula One full-time with the March team, led by Gariboldi and running Herd&#x27;s new chassis with a Cosworth V8 normally aspirated engine. Capelli also continued with BMW touring cars for the Schnitzer team, as the March budget was tight (so much that they raced at the Belgian Grand Prix with a detuned 3.3-litre sports car engine rather than the full 3.5l Formula One unit), and the Schnitzer team had works status with BMW, allowing him to be on the German company&#x27;s payroll. Capelli scored March&#x27;s first point with sixth at the Monaco Grand Prix and March&#x27;s return to Formula One was generally seen as competent, professional and promising for the future.

In 1988 Capelli had a March chassis designed by Adrian Newey (later a winner of multiple Constructors&#x27; Championships as a designer at Williams, McLaren and Red Bull) combined with a Judd V8 engine (derived from the Brabham-Honda CART engine and the Judd/Honda F3000 unit). March had hoped to be the favoured development partner for this engine, but they found themselves sharing it with the French Ligier team as well as the defending F1 Constructors&#x27; Champions Williams who had lost their supply of turbocharged Honda engines to McLaren. Capelli was joined in the team by the British Formula 3 Champion, Brazilian rookie Maurício Gugelmin. They made a strong team and the March 881 was the surprise of the year. At Spa-Francorchamps he scored his first podium with a third place behind Ayrton Senna&#x27;s and Alain Prost&#x27;s McLarens (though this was not known until after the season when the Benettons were disqualified for fuel irregularities). Capelli&#x27;s best finish was second place at the Portuguese Grand Prix where he finished behind Prost. Even better was ahead for the Italian when he became the first non-turbo driver since to lead a World Championship Grand Prix. This happened on lap 16 of the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka when Prost missed a gear coming out of the final chicane and Capelli was able to get ahead before the start/finish line and officially lead the lap. However, Prost used Honda&#x27;s superior power and was ahead before turn 1. His Judd V8 suffered an electrical failure just three laps later.

However, the momentum did not continue. March had financial problems and a sponsor, Leyton House, acquired a controlling interest. Gugelmin finished third in his home race at Jacarepaguá in 1989, but this was done in the 1988 car. The definitive 1989 Leyton House March was a disappointment, and neither driver challenged for the top in the rest of the year. Capelli in particular only finished once throughout the season (12th in Belgium) and went far enough to be classified on one further occasion (Monaco where he dropped out from 6th place near the end and was classified 11th). Despite this, he was one of only six drivers to start in all of the 16 races of the 1989 season (the others were the McLaren drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, the Williams duo Riccardo Patrese and Thierry Boutsen, and Benetton&#x27;s Alessandro Nannini). Team spirit remained intact despite the death of Gariboldi in a car crash and midway through the season Capelli felt happy enough in the team to take up his option for 1990. The new decade started poorly, though. Newey&#x27;s car (given the prefix CG in honour of Gariboldi) had excellent aerodynamics and exclusive use of Judd&#x27;s updated V8 engine, but it was intolerant of bumps. It was so bad on the notoriously bumpy Mexico City track that neither driver could control the car and both failed to qualify. Nevertheless, in the next at Paul Ricard in France came a complete turnaround in form. Capelli led Gugelmin in a Leyton House 1–2 throughout much of the race. Gugelmin finally retired, and Capelli was overtaken near the end by the Ferrari of Prost with only 3 laps remaining and went on to finish second. Revisions to the car had made it more competitive (ironically Newey left the team shortly before the race to join Williams), but it was the billiard table-smooth track which allowed the result. Despite some promising showings at Silverstone and Hockenheim, it remained their best race of the season.

In 1991, Leyton House was responsible not only for chassis development but also bankrolled the ambitious Ilmor V10 engine programme. With so many new ingredients, results were again sparse, although Capelli often qualified and raced well. When Leyton House&#x27;s owner Akira Akagi was arrested in connection with the Fuji Bank fraud, the team was in a precarious state. Capelli had signed for Scuderia Ferrari for the &#x27;92 season, so he voluntarily stepped down, allowing pay driver Karl Wendlinger to finish the season and personally paid to attend the races he missed to offer support to the team and advice to his rookie substitute.

===Ferrari and Jordan (1992–1993)===
In 1992, Capelli became the first Italian with a regular drive with Ferrari since Michele Alboreto in 1988, after Gianni Morbidelli&#x27;s one-off race for the team the season before. The Scuderia had gone through a tough time in 1991, but with a new car, the F92A, expectations were high. The new car was not competitive and before the season began Capelli was showing his disappointment. A driver who enjoyed the convivial atmosphere of a family-type team, he struggled to integrate with the bureaucratic structure of the early 1990s Ferrari. Losing motivation, the team in turn lost confidence in him and his teammate Jean Alesi gained the upper hand. Capelli was sacked before the season&#x27;s end. It was the last time until Felipe Massa in 2011 that a Ferrari driver failed to finish on the podium during a season.
This experience seemingly broke his spirit, but those who had worked with him in March still had faith, notably Ian Phillips, then Jordan&#x27;s team manager. Taking a Jordan seat for 1993 alongside young rookie Rubens Barrichello, whom the team hoped would prosper under the more experienced driver, Capelli failed to rediscover the spark that not long ago had marked him as a champion of the future. After failing to qualify for the second race in Brazil, he left the team by mutual consent, being replaced by Thierry Boutsen. He did not race in Formula One again.

==Other ventures==
===Touring car racing===
Following his exit from Formula One, Capelli raced from 1994 to 1996 with a Nissan Primera with mixed results in the German Super Tourenwagen Cup for BMS Scuderia Italia and in some rounds of the Spanish Touring Car Championship in 1995 and 1996. 

===Broadcasting===
Capelli became a Formula One commentator from 1998 until 2017 on the Italian TV station Rai 1.

<doc id="1181414" wikidata="Q1997703" url="?curid=1181414" title="Bandeiras (Madalena)">
<text>is a civil parish in the municipality of Madalena on the island of Pico in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 626, in an area of 22.21 km².

==History==
The parish is the home of the Island&#x27;s first judiciary. The area was named &quot;Bandeiras&quot; after the magistrates&#x27; official flags raised on the site&#x27;s many buildings (&quot;bandeiras&quot; is the plural form of &quot;flag&quot; in Portuguese).

The settlers initially focused on animal husbandry, agriculture and a fledgling winery, although some commerce and services developed concurrently. During the 18th and 19th centuries its viticulture expanded dramatically, owing to its micro-climate. The Church Matriz of Nossa Senhora da Boa Nova (), a three-nave temple, was inaugurated in 1871. Today the church is in a state of disrepair, due to the July 9, 1988, earthquake that struck the island of Pico.

==Geography==
The parish is located along the northwestern coast of the municipality and connected to the regional road that encircles the island. The area is relatively hilly along the coast, and gradually slopes towards the interior, where it reaches its peak (literally) in the stratovolcano of Pico. Its borders conform to an irregular pie-shaped wedge between the parishes of Madalena and Santa Luzia (in the municipality of São Roque do Pico); its widest portion is approximately 1.5 kilometres and about 5 kilometres long from the coast to Ponta do Pico. Most cultivatable lands are close to the roadways, and the community is predominantly rural. Forests dominate the mid-elevations, while scrub, mosses and smaller tree species are exist along the slopes of the mountain.

Although Bandeiras is primarily concentrated along the Regional Road ER.1-1ª, there are different agglomerations that comprise the settlement; Lajes, Bandeiras and Lajinhas follow the road, Cachorro, Portal da Fonte, Cais do Mourato and Baixio Pequeno skirt the coast, and north of the road the smaller hamlets of Gafeira or Farrobo are mostly abandoned.

Bandeiras, together with Santa Luzia, is the site of Pico Airport.

<text>Gene Chandler (born Eugene Drake Dixon; July 6, 1937) is an American singer, songwriter, music producer, and record-label executive. Chandler is nicknamed &quot;the Duke of Earl&quot; or, simply, &quot;the Duke.&quot; He is best known for his most successful songs, &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; and &quot;Groovy Situation&quot;, and his association with the Dukays, the Impressions, and Curtis Mayfield.

Chandler is a Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and a recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation&#x27;s Pioneer Award. He is one of the few singers to achieve chart success spanning the doo-wop, rhythm and blues, soul and disco musical eras, with some top-40 pop and R&amp;B chart hits between 1961 and 1986. Chandler was inducted as a performer into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame on August 24, 2014. In 2016, he became a double inductee in the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame with his induction as an R&amp;B music pioneer.

==Early years==
Chandler was born Eugene Drake Dixon in Chicago on July 6, 1937. He attended Englewood High School on the city&#x27;s South Side. Chandler began performing during the early 1950s with the Gaytones. He joined the Dukays with James Lowe, Shirley Jones, Earl Edwards and Ben Broyles in 1957, soon becoming their lead singer. After being drafted into the U.S. Army, Chandler returned to Chicago in 1960 and rejoined the Dukays.

==Career==
The Dukays were offered a recording contract by Nat Records and recorded a single, &quot;The Girl Is a Devil&quot; (1961), with producers Carl Davis and Bill &quot;Bunky&quot; Sheppard. This was followed by a session in August 1961 which resulted in four songs, including &quot;Nite Owl&quot; and &quot;Duke of Earl&quot;. Nat Records released &quot;Nite Owl&quot;, and it became an R&amp;B success by the end of the year. Davis and Sheppard shopped &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; to Vee-Jay Records, which released it in 1962 by Dixon (known as Gene Chandler).

&quot;Duke of Earl&quot; sold one million copies in a little over a month, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. After the song spent three weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, Chandler purchased a cape, monocle, cane and top hat and advertised himself as the Duke of Earl. He appeared in costume singing &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; in &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Twist&quot;, a 1962 film featuring Chubby Checker. Chandler&#x27;s concerts became popular, and he performed encoresusually &quot;Rainbow&quot;, a Curtis Mayfield song.

Chandler left Vee-Jay in the autumn of 1963 and recorded for Constellation Records, another Chicago company. After Constellation went bankrupt in 1966, he was contracted to Chess and then to Brunswick Records; for a time, Chess and Brunswick alternated in releasing Chandler&#x27;s recordings. He had Top-20 hits with Constellation with &quot;Just Be True&quot; (1964) and &quot;Nothing Can Stop Me&quot; (1965), both written by Curtis Mayfield and produced by Carl Davis.

Other successes included &quot;What Now,&quot; &quot;Rainbow,&quot; &quot;I Fooled You This Time,&quot; &quot;Think Nothing About It,&quot; &quot;A Man&#x27;s Temptation,&quot; &quot;To Be a Lover,&quot; &quot;Rainbow &#x27;65&quot; (recorded live at Chicago&#x27;s Regal Theater), &quot;Bless Our Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurt Me No More.&quot; Chandler was also successful with his cover version of James Brown&#x27;s &quot;There Was a Time&quot; and &quot;You Threw a Lucky Punch&quot;, released as an answer song to Mary Wells&#x27; Motown hit &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot;.

After several years performing concerts, Chandler decided to become more involved with music production. He formed a production company and two record labels: Bamboo and Mister Chand. Chandler produced a hit with &quot;Groovy Situation&quot;, released on Mercury Records in 1970, which reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts: his second-greatest success, after &quot;Duke of Earl&quot;. &quot;Groovy Situation&quot; sold over a million copies and was certified gold by the RIAA in November of that year.

Chandler had produced &quot;Backfield in Motion&quot; in 1969 for Mel and Tim on Bamboo Records, which reached number three on the R&amp;B chart and the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. He followed this in 1970 with &quot;Good Guys Only Win in the Movies&quot; for the duo; the song reached number 17 on the R&amp;B chart and number 45 on the pop-music chart.

Later that year, Chandler recorded the album &quot;Gene and Jerry: One on One&quot; with fellow Chicago artist Jerry Butler. He also was featured along with the Impressions, LeRoy Hutson and Curtis Mayfield on the live album &quot;Curtis in Chicago&quot; (1973). Chandler sang on Arthur Louis&#x27;s album &quot;Knocking on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; (1974), with Eric Clapton. A period with Curtom Records, a label co-founded by Mayfield, resulted in four self-produced singles; none charted.

Chandler had some success with disco-style music during the late 1970s, making records with his former producer Carl Davis which included &quot;Get Down&quot;, &quot;When You&#x27;re #1&quot; and &quot;Does She Have a Friend?&quot; Appointed executive vice-president of Davis&#x27; Chi-Sound Records, he worked with reggae singer Johnny Nash. During the mid to late 1970s, a resurgence of interest in 1950s music and pop culture inspired disc jockey Wolfman Jack to organize a tour by vintage acts, including Chandler.

&quot;Duke of Earl&quot; was sampled by Cypress Hill on &quot;Hand on the Pump&quot; from their album &quot;Cypress Hill&quot; (1991), and Chandler&#x27;s song &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot; was sampled on their album &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1993). In 1997, he received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation.

In 1988, &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; was included on the soundtrack of &quot;Hairspray&quot;; &quot;Groovy Situation&quot; appeared on &quot;&quot; (2004). In 2002, &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; was selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of its &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2016, Chandler was honored in his hometown of Chicago by having a street named after him for his industry accomplishments, hit records, and his civic and philanthropic efforts for the city and its people.

His son, Defrantz Forest, sings with the Motown group The Originals.

<text>A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments, often but not exclusively at a professional level of proficiency.

Also known as [[woodwind doubler|doubling]], the practice allows greater ensemble flexibility and more efficient employment of musicians, where a particular instrument may be employed only briefly or sporadically during a performance. Doubling is not uncommon in orchestra (e.g., flutists who double on piccolo) and jazz (saxophone/flute players); double bass players might also perform on electric bass. In music theatre, a pit orchestra&#x27;s reed players might be required to perform on multiple instruments. Church piano players are often expected to play the church&#x27;s pipe organ or Hammond organ as well.

In popular music it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be proficient on instruments not from the same family, for instance to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians&#x27; unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay, for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.

==Early music==
The European &quot;Piffari&quot;, &quot;Stadtpfeifer&quot; and &quot;Waits&quot; were multi-instrumentalists, who played trumpet, sackbut, shawm, cornett, recorder and string-instruments. Musicians with an education of a &quot;Stadtpfeifer&quot; were Gottfried Reiche, Johann Joachim Quantz, Johann Christof Pezel and Sigmund Theophil Staden. Also many European church musicians of the 17th and 18th centuries were multi-instrumentalists, who played several instruments. Georg Philipp Telemann for example played violin, viola da gamba, recorder, flauto traverso, oboe, shawm, sackbut and double bass.

==Classical music==
Some famous classical composer-performers could play multiple instruments at a high level, such as Mozart, who was a virtuoso on the keyboard and violin. Music written for symphony orchestra usually calls for a percussion section featuring a number of musicians who might each play a variety of different instruments during a performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, call for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score. Similarly, clarinet players may double on bass clarinet, oboe players on cor anglais, and bassoon players on contrabassoon. Trumpet players may switch to piccolo trumpet for certain Baroque literature, and first trombone players may switch to alto trombone. Bass trombone players are sometimes required to double on contrabass trombone, most notably in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; operas. Organ players are also commonly expected to master the harpsichord as well. Doubling elsewhere in the orchestra is rare. With musical theatre pit orchestras, woodwind players are expected to play a large number of woodwind instruments.

==Jazz, modern, and contemporary music==
In the swing era of big band music, woodwind players were often expected to play multiple woodwind instruments; saxophonists might be offered gigs where they were also required to play clarinet, for example.

The different types of saxophone use similar designs, varying mainly only in size (and therefore pitch), meaning that once a player has learned to play one it is relatively easy for them to translate the skills into another. As a result, many jazz saxophone players have made careers playing several different instruments, such as John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, both of whom have frequently used both tenor and soprano saxophones. To a lesser extent this is also the case across the range of woodwind instruments: Jazz flute players often play other instruments as well, such as Eric Dolphy and Herbie Mann, both of whom frequently played flute and saxophone; Dolphy also recorded on bass clarinet. In the early years of jazz, when the genre was still linked to the marching band genre, many double-bass players doubled on tuba.

From the 1950s onwards and particularly since the development of jazz-rock fusion in the late 1960s, many double-bass players doubled on electric bass, e.g. Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci.

Another famous multi-instrumentalist is Jacob Collier. His career started off with split-screen YouTube videos that caught the eye of music legends like Herbie Hancock. With his help, Collier recorded his debut album &quot;In My Room&quot; and then went on to write many more albums. He is proficient on many different instruments, including vocals, piano, keyboards, bass guitar, upright bass, drums, percussion, guitar, and more. 

Some jazz instrumentalists whose main instrument is a horn or bass also play jazz piano, because piano is an excellent instrument for composing and arranging, and for developing greater harmonic knowledge.

Many famous jazz musicians, including James Morrison, Don Burrows, and Brian Landrus, are multi-instrumentalists.

==Rock and pop music==

In popular music styles, many musicians and songwriters are multi-instrumentalists. Songwriters often play both piano, a key instrument for arranging and composing, and popular pop or rock instruments such as guitar. A backing band member who doubles will be instructed by the bandleader when to switch instruments (e.g., from bass to Hammond organ). When playing live, most multi-instrumentalists will concentrate on their main instrument and/or vocals, and hire or recruit backing musicians (or use a sequencer) to play the other instruments, thus benefiting from economies of scope.

===Examples=== 
Some musicians have pushed the limits of human musical skill on different instruments. British entertainer Roy Castle once set a world record by playing the same tune on 43 different instruments in four minutes. Anton Newcombe, frontman for The Brian Jonestown Massacre, has claimed to be able to play 80 different instruments. Brian Jones, late founder and guitarist of The Rolling Stones was well known to experiment with, and utilize various instruments, both Western and exotic. By the time of his death, Jones had played a multitude of instruments on released recordings ranging from traditional blues hallmarks – like the Harmonica, Slide Guitar and the Piano – to more exotic ones such as the Sitar, Mellotron and the Appalachian Dulcimer. Another famous multi-instrumentalist is Paul McCartney; on his album &quot;McCartney&quot;, for example, he is credited with vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, piano, organ, percussion, wineglasses, Mellotron, and effects; the only other credited performer is his wife Linda who provided harmony vocals. Progressive rock composer Mike Oldfield plays many types of guitars, organ, piano, mandolin, timpani, and bouzouki (among others) with proficiency. However, he considers himself primarily a guitarist. 

== Bluegrass ==

In bluegrass music, it is very common for musicians to be skilled on a number of different instruments, including guitar, banjo, fiddle and upright bass.

From the coast, for about , the parish comprises cultivatable lands and settlements, which starts sloping into higher altitudes, reaching its extreme at Ponta do Pico; the parish is basically a pie-shaped wedge, with at its extreme, along the coast. Settled areas are divided equally between hedge-row-divided parcels and forested patches of land, with scrub and natural vegetation occupying higher altitudes.

In addition to central Candelária (which also encompasses the communities of Biscoitos, Alto and Eira) there are smaller hamlets within the borders that follow the regional roadway, such as: Monte, Mirateca and Campo Raso.

<text>Candelária is a civil parish in the municipality of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,079, in an area of 8.63 km². It is situated along the southwest flank of the Sete Cidades massif.

==History==

The history of the parish extends back to the 15th century, and was first chronicled in &quot;Saudades da Terra&quot; by Gaspar Frutuoso. It is unclear when the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora do Socorro was built, although a legend exists that the small chapel was constructed by the crew of a ship that escaped disaster on the high seas. Arriving in the safe waters of Candelária they fired a shot into the air towards shore, and promised to construct a hermitage to Virgin Mary where the bullet fell. Much later, August Loureiro served as the locale for several scenes in his regional novel &quot;A Bruxa&quot;.

The construction of the current church took place before 1535 in a place that, legend suggests, was not the site originally selected. Most of the builders wanted to rebuild this church on a new site, but after some discussion a decision was made to build on the site of the older hermitage. However, the materials continued to disappear from the build site, and miraculously re-appear on the site where the church is located today. Rumour spread of a veiled woman, who transported the materials nightly after the workers abandoned the site for the evening; strangely, the image of the Virgin was covered in soot every morning, and the townsfolk assumed that it was through the intervention of the saint.

The letter dated 20 July 1568 by the diocese of Angra, raised the stipend of the local vicar from 10$000 to 20$000 cruzados. But, even this document did not refer to the local parochial church of Nossa Senhora das Candeis, but actually to the Church of Nossa Senhora da Purificação of Sete Cidades, suggesting that the parish was part of the parish of Sete Cidades. The first documented reference to Candeis came ion 26 March 1556.

By 1634, the local priest received an annual stipend of 25$000 cruzados and another 3% from the contributions to the Chapel of the Infantes. This remained the standard income for the priests as late as 1730. Between 1632 and 1690, 138$500 cruzados were spent on the church, with several projects in stone alone completed in 1697 for 56$000 cruzados.

This was nothing in comparison with the post-1811 earthquake which damaged the temple, resulting in the Bishop of Angra visiting the site. He ordered the beginning of a new phase of construction that included rebuilding the frontispiece, the installation of a new ceiling, construction of tower and sacristy. Yet, even by 1826, the project had still not been completed.

==Geography==

It is located in the southwestern part of the island of São Miguel, connected by a regional road network (the &quot;Estrada Regional E.R.1-1ª&quot;) to regional centres of Mosteiros, Ginetes (both to the west), Feteiras (to the east) and indirectly to Ponta Delgada, accessed daily by bus transport. The parish extends from the flanks of the Sete Cidades Massif towards the Atlantic cliffs, and begins in the locality of Chão da Lomba Cruz and extends to village of Socorro (location of the original settlement).

In addition to Chão da Lomba da Cruz and Socorro, there are several other small hamlets or neighbourhoods including: Pinheiros (along the &quot;Ribeira do Ferreiro&quot;); Lombinha; Albinos; Canto Redondo; Vale; Paríso; Pico; Ramal do Pico; and Canada dos Arrifes. The region is divided between farmlands, which predominate, and forest vegetation along the rim of the Sete Cidades crater (which it borders to the interior).

<text>Criação Velha is a civil parish in the municipality of Madalena on the island of Pico in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 768, in an area of 18.36 km2. It contains the localities Alto da Cêrca, Canada de Beatriz, Canada de Pedro Nunes, Canada do Bacelo, Canada do Costa, Canada do Japão, Canada do Monte, João Lima, Lajidos, Rosário and Tapadas.

== History ==
Historical evidence, from the municipality of Madalena, relates that the name Criação Velha comes from an agricultural reference: it was an area where cattle (no distinction) were raised long ago. The term criação means &quot;raising&quot;, and Velha is old, referring to historical records that the area was (and continues to be) important in this pursuit. Owing to the rich fertile lands the early settlers occupied most of their time with agriculture and wine production, slowly developing a commerce sector and industry later into its existence.

== Geography ==
The parish is located in the western coast of the municipality, sandwiched between the parishes of Madalena and Candelária; a pie-shaped wedge that extends just to the base of Ponte do Pico to an area of about 2.75 kilometers at its maximum width. Unlike the other parishes with the municipality of Madalena, Criação Velha&#x27;s borders does not extend to the top of Pico (its limit stops about 2 kilometers from the summit of the stratovolcano). The area is relatively hilly, sloping gradually from forested parcels into an area of semi-cultivatable land and then scrub pasture-lands. Most practical farming occurs around the central parish, since the forested lands are dense and impractical. The area is recognized for a series of grottos, with about 5 kilometers of extensions, carved from the dykes and subterranean lava fields along the island&#x27;s history.

== Sights ==

The parish church of Nossa Senhora das Dores consisting of only one nave was constructed in 1728. The church is united to the main street by a representative avenue consisting of plane trees. The Chapel of the Holy Spirit close to the church was built in 1902. In the village center several well-preserved residential buildings dating from the 19th and from the beginning of the 20th centuries can be seen.

The parish is surrounded by vineyards. The Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004.

<text>Rupertswood railway station was located on the Melbourne – Bendigo railway in the north-western Melbourne suburb of Sunbury in Victoria, Australia. It was the last station in the state that operated only to service school traffic, with services only stopping to pick up and drop off passengers for the adjacent Salesian College.

== History ==
Rupertswood was first opened in 1879 as a private platform on the down line, for the convenience of guests at &quot;Rupertswood&quot;, the country residence of William John Clarke, who became Australia&#x27;s first baronet. His townhouse was &quot;Cliveden&quot;, in Wellington Parade, Melbourne.

In addition to people attending garden parties at Rupertswood, the platform was used on approximately 15 occasions between July 1879 and February 1890, for various groups, such as Sunday school excursions. The Findon Harriers and the Sunbury Racing Club also used the platform for their fox hunts and race meetings.

In 1889, the Victorian Railways traffic manager recommended the construction of a second platform, because of the number of people who had to cross the tracks. For example, during a medical congress in January 1889, over 800 people had to do so. There was also the problem of having to work the system as a single line between Sunbury and the only platform. The cost of the second platform was debited to maintenance rather than Sir William Clarke.

In 1927, Rupertswood mansion was acquired by the Salesian Order who established a boys&#x27; boarding school there. From about 1930, an annual Eucharistic Festival was held at the school, with a number of special trains being run, requiring temporary intermediate block posts to be established between St Albans and Sunbury. The last Eucharistic Festival was held in 1980.

In 1940, the second platform was removed. After 1962, the station was used daily by students attending the college. In the early 2000s, the Victorian government&#x27;s Regional Fast Rail project involved the rebuilding of much of the Bendigo line. Because Rupertswood station only catered for school traffic it was decided to close it, and that occurred in December 2004.

<text>is a civil parish in the municipality of Madalena along the southwestern coast of the island of Pico, the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 480, in an area of 23.88 km2.

==History==
The settlement of the region of São Caetano began with natives from the north of Portugal, after a period of settlement in Terceira and Graciosa, that included many slaves and Africans. These first settlers were devoted to the Saint Caetano, including Father Vicenza, and Francisco Pires of Flores, who ordered the construction of the first hermitage to the saint. During this period, it was part of the settlement of São Mateus, founded in 1482.

In the early period of discovery, the island of Pico was to have its own Captain-Donatário, Álvaro de Ornelas, but never achieved this position, owing to the island&#x27;s incorporation in the Captaincy of Faial and Pico, under Josse de Huertre&#x27;s administration.

Initially, oriented to the cultivation of wheat and corn, while exporting woad, over time the population began to cultivate vineyards and began fishing.

The parish of São Caetano is also known as Prainha do Sul or Galeão, in honour of Garcia Gonçalves Madruga who built here in the 16th century, as payment to King John III, for his debits.

Another point of interest occurred during the construction of the parochial church, by Manuel da Silveira de Melo; there was a shortage of timer, which greatly retarded the construction of the church, also aggravated by a strong storm that affect the entire island. At the same time a ship wrecked laden with wheat and timber, which ended-up being used for the construction of the parochial temple. The local populous attributed these to acts of God and a miracle, as it occurred at a timely point the parish&#x27;s life.

==Geography==
The parish is located in the southern part of the municipality and borders the neighbouring municipality of Lajes do Pico, from the municipal seat. It is a geologically accented region marked by evidence of lava fields and landslides extending from the coast to the summit of Ponta do Pico. Most of the land is covered in dense forests, and most settlements has tended to follow the Regional Road E.R. 1-1ª. Most agriculture is concentrated around São Caetano principally, while parcels along the coast have been used for wine vineyards.

In addition to São Caetano, which is located in the western portion of the parish, the other principal settlement is the village of Terra de Pão, located in the opposite end. Other localities in the parish are Baixas, Cabeço, Caminho de Cima, Fontes, Prainha do Galeão, Queimadas, Rua de Cima and Santa Margarida.

==Architecture==
The most significant built-up patrimony in the parish include the parochial church, the hermitage of Santa Margarida, the tidal pools, &quot;Casa do Povo&quot; and some older &quot;adegas&quot; (or wine-cellars). The national directory of patrimony has classified the following, as national monuments or properties of public interest:
* Church of São Caetano (), a two-storey church with a facade of arched windows and principal doorway, topped by steeple, erected in 1878;
* Império of São Caetano (), 20th century religious architecture, consisting of a rectangular império/chapel and building, with an arched facade flanked by pilasters, with polychromatic structural elements;

<text>The Institute Giovanni Treccani for the publication of the Italian Encyclopedia (), also known as the Treccani Institute or simply Treccani, is a cultural institution of national interest, active in the publishing field, founded by Giovanni Treccani and Giovanni Gentile in 1925. It is renowned for publishing the first edition and the subsequent ten supplements of the &quot;Italian Encyclopaedia of Science, Literature and Arts&quot; (), considered one of the most important encyclopaedias of the 20th century.
==History==
The Institute of the Italian Encyclopaedia was founded in Rome in 1925 by Giovanni Treccani, with the philosopher Giovanni Gentile as editor-in-chief. The first publication by the Institute was the Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere e Arti (). This encyclopaedia, best known as Enciclopedia Italiana or the Great Encyclopaedia, is an Italian-language encyclopaedia and is regarded as one of the great encyclopaedias, being international in scope, alongside &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and others.

Since the 1990s, Treccani has been playing a leading role as a high profile publisher, both in the art publishing market and in the facsimile editions industry, reproducing many medieval manuscripts from the most prestigious italian and european libraries. Alongside these traditional activities Treccani has gained a consistent presence in digital publishing, with the publication of e-books, apps and, above all the Treccani.it portal, which had been visited in 2022 by more than 80 million unique users.

==Publishing and works==
The first edition of the Great Encyclopaedia was published serially between 1929 and 1937. The encyclopaedia&#x27;s 35 volumes (plus one index volume) included 60,000 articles and 50 million words. Each volume is approximately 1,015 pages, and supplementary volumes were published between 1938 and 2020. 

10th Appendix

An update to the Great Encyclopaedia, the 10th Appendix is a reflection by Treccani on contemporaneity. Its challenges and problematic issues are analyzed in a language of great clarity and readability through over 350 keywords assigned to authors of the highest scientific profile and to young scholars who have now established themselves at the international level.

Biographical Dictionary of Italians

A monumental national biography reconstructed through over forty thousand biographies of Italians who have contributed to the artistic, cultural, political, scientific, religious, literary and economic history of the country, from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the present day.

Contemporary art

A work in 4 volumes edited by Vincenzo Trione and Valeria Della Valle, supported by an international scientific committee: a survey of the art of our time, with the aim of documenting, in the broadest and most inclusive perspective, the various components that make up the system of art throughout the world.

Italian Enterprise

In two volumes, edited by Franco Amatori and Marco D&#x27;Alberti, it recounts the most significant entrepreneurial, technological and scientific developments in the history of our country. &quot;The Stories&quot;, with its wide selection of biographies of the most representative industrial enterprises, aims to provide a picture of Italian companies in their great variety of size, territory, sector, and governance. &quot;The Context&quot; frames thematic essays that recount the eventful history of the Italian enterprise in its complex operating context, in its relationship with institutions and politics, in the competitive scene of globalization.

Fac-simile reproductions

Fac-simile reproductions of illuminated manuscripts kept in the most important European libraries contributes to the conservation and diffusion of an immense common artistic and literary heritage. The latest publications are that of the magnificent code preserved in Florence in the Laurentian Library, with the signature Plut. 6.23 an 11th-12th century Gospel book, accompanied by a systematic illustrative apparatus. The 237 folios contain 285 illustrations. As Tania Velmans defines it in the essay published in the volume accompanying the facsimile (&quot;Il Tetravangelo della Laurenziana&quot;, Florence, Laur. Plut. 6.23, 2020), it is &quot;an almost unique specimen for the abundance of his illustrations, fidelity to the evangelical texts, the will to reconstruct the evangelical story through the image, in an almost integral way&quot; (p. 36).

<text>Italian comics, also known as &quot;fumetto&quot; , plural form &quot;fumetti&quot; , are comics that originate in Italy. The most popular Italian comics have been translated into many languages. The term &quot;fumetto&quot; (literally &quot;little puff of smoke&quot;) refers to the distinctive word balloons that contain the dialogue in comics (also called &quot;nuvoletta&quot;, &quot;little cloud&quot;, in Italian).

In English, the term &quot;fumetti&quot; can refer to photo comics, regardless of origin or language.

== History ==

Italian &quot;fumetto&quot; has its roots in periodicals aimed at younger readers and in the satirical publications of the 19th century. These magazines published cartoons and illustrations for educational and propagandist purposes. The first illustrated satirical publication appeared in 1848, in &quot;L&#x27;Arlecchino&quot;, a daily paper published in Naples. Other noteworthy examples of satirical papers of the period include &quot;Lo Spirito Folletto&quot; published in Milan, Turin&#x27;s &quot;Il Fischietto&quot; and &quot;Il Fanfulla&quot;, established in Rome in 1872. As far as publications for kids, some of the most significant titles of the period are &quot;Il Giornale per i Fanciulli&quot; (1834), &quot;Il Giovinetto Italiano&quot; (1849), and &quot;Giornale per i bambini&quot; (1881).In 1899 &quot;Il Novellino&quot; debuted. The paper was the first to publish Outcault&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Kid&quot; in Italy in 1904, but the first Italian comic did not appear until four years later.

=== Birth ===
On December 27, 1908, the first mainstream publication primarily for comics, &quot;Il Corriere dei Piccoli&quot;, appeared on Italian newstands. The first issue introduced readers to the adventures of Bilbolbul by Attilio Mussino, featuring a little black kid who is considered the first Italian comic character.

Despite being officially considered the birthplace of &quot;fumetto&quot;, the &quot;Corrierino&quot;, as it was nicknamed, did not use balloons in the stories that it publishes, opting instead for captions in verse. Regardless, the sequential narration and the recurring characters made the publication the first Italian comic magazine.

The most prolific comics illustrator before World War I was Antonio Rubino. Both Mussino and Rubino based their strips on parodies of school learning: Bilbolbul is a parody of idioms, while &quot;Quadratino&quot; (literally &quot;Little Square&quot;) is a parody of geometry.

&quot;Il Corrierino&quot; introduced American comics to an Italian audience: &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot; was renamed &quot;Fortunello&quot;, &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; became &quot;Bibì e Bibò&quot;, Bringing Up Father was &quot;Arcibaldo e Petronilla&quot;, &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; became &quot;Mio Mao&quot;.

Following &quot;Il Corrierino&quot;&#x27;s spectacular success (reaching 700 000 copies), several other periodicals appeared during the following years: &quot;Il Giornaletto&quot; (1910), &quot;Donnina&quot; (1914), &quot;L&#x27;Intrepido&quot; (1920), and &quot;Piccolo mondo&quot; (1924).

=== Fumetto during Fascism ===
The fascist regime was quick to recognize the potential for propaganda through the new medium. During the 1920s several periodicals published educational comics for Italian youth, including &quot;Il Giornale dei Balilla&quot; (1923) and &quot;La piccola italiana&quot; (1927).

The three most popular characters of the period, reprinted for decades on &quot;Corrierino&quot;, were:
*&quot;Il Signor Bonaventura&quot; by Sergio Tofano (1917), was the Italian response to &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;, with a big difference: if the latter is always unlucky, at the end of every story Bonaventura wins a million liras.
*&quot;Sor Pampurio&quot; (an Italian equivalent of &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;) by Carlo Bisi (1925), was a parody of parvenus: not really Fascist, it expresses bourgeois classism.
*&quot;Marmittone&quot; by Bruno Angoletta (1929), was a mildly antimilitaristic strip, the maximum anti-authoritarianism allowed by Fascism.

Beginning January 1, 1939, the publication of foreign comics was forbidden, and Italian material was required to follow a strict standard, exalting heroism, patriotism, and the superiority of the Italian race. To work around these restrictions, some publishers simply renamed American heroes with Italian names. The only exception to the censorship was &quot;Topolino&quot;, the Italian name for &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, published by Nerbini starting on December 31, 1931. Apparently, the reason behind this special treatment for Walt Disney&#x27;s character was Benito Mussolini&#x27;s children&#x27;s passion for the little mouse. In 1935 Nerbini sold &quot;Topolino&quot; to Mondadori, which published it with great success until 1988.

In 1932 Milan publisher Lotario Vecchi started &quot;Jumbo&quot;, a weekly magazine that many consider the first true Italian comics publication. The magazine reached a circulation of 350,000 copies, sanctioning comics as a mainstream medium with broad appeal.

In 1937 &quot;Il Vittorioso&quot; appeared, a Catholic magazine entirely composed of Italian comics. It was an attempt to compete with similar secular publications like &quot;L&#x27;Avventuroso&quot; (1934), &quot;Il Monello&quot; (1933), and &quot;L&#x27;Audace&quot; (1937).

=== After World War II: Bonelli and the rise of the comic book ===
The end of World War II marked a flurry of activity in the Italian comic press: many titles that were forced to suspend publication during the war came back to saturate the newsstands, joined by new publications often backed by improvised publishers looking for a quick buck. Finally this oversupply of comic material resulted in a crisis of the traditional comic magazine. Among the numerous publications of the period were &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; (1944), a Roman magazine that presented American adventure strips like &quot;Mandrake&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Uomo Mascherato (The Phantom)&quot;, and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. Another Roman publication appeared in 1945: &quot;Robinson&quot;, a first attempt to target a more adult audience. It introduced several American characters like &quot;Prince Valiant, Tarzan, Secret Agent X-9, Rip Kirby, Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. &quot;Robinson&quot; lasted until 1947, publishing 90 issues.

In 1945, one of the most original magazines of the period was born: &quot;L&#x27;asso di Picche&quot; published in Venice as a result of the work of a group of young Venetian artists, including Alberto Ongaro, Damiano Damiani, Dino Battaglia, Rinaldo D&#x27;Ami, and above all Fernando Carcupino and Hugo Pratt. Their distinctive approach to the art form earned them the name of &quot;Venetian School&quot; of comics. Among the characters created for the magazine were Pratt&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Asso di Picche&quot;, Battaglia&#x27;s &quot;Junglemen, Draky&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.

Inspired by the success of the Catholic &quot;Il Vittorioso&quot;, the Italian Communist party decided to use the comic medium for their own purposes: in 1949 &quot;Il Pioniere&quot; was born. Aimed at a very young audience, the new publication presented fantasy material as well as adventures, with an eye to the social issues of the period.

On &quot;Il Vittorioso&quot; began the career of the most famous satirical comic writer of post-war Italy, Benito Jacovitti. However, his most popular character, Cocco Bill (1957), a parody of Western comics, was published in the newspaper &quot;Il Giorno&quot; and then in the other Catholic comic magazine &quot;Il Giornalino&quot;.

In 1954 &quot;Il Disco Volante&quot; began publication. It is the Italian version of British weekly &quot;Eagle&quot;, and introduced &quot;Dan Dare&quot; to the Italian public. In 1955 &quot;Tintin&quot; appeared, adapted from the French &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, which first presented Franco-Belgian comics to the Italian public.

But the most significant phenomenon of the period was the appearance of comics books. Printed in a variety of formats, from strip size to booklets to giant size, they presented collected stories from the periodicals as well as new adventures of Italian characters. It is on the comic books pages that heroes &quot;made in Italy&quot; gained popularity, eventually overshadowing their American counterparts.

Among the host of Italian series that were created during these years, &quot;Tex Willer&quot; is without doubt the most renowned. Born on September 30, 1948, from the imagination of Gian Luigi Bonelli and from the pencil of Aurelio Galleppini, &quot;Tex Willer&quot; became the model for a line of publications that became known as &quot;Bonelliano&quot;, from the name of the publisher. These comic books presented complete stories in 100+ black and white pages in a pocket book format. The subject matter was always adventure, whether western, horror, mystery or science fiction. The &quot;bonelliani&quot; are to date the most popular form of comics in the country.

Some of the series that followed &quot;Tex Willer&quot; were &quot;Zagor&quot; (1961), a tomahawk-wielding hero who protects the imaginary Darkwood forest in eastern US, &quot;Comandante Mark&quot; (1966), featuring a soldier in the American independence war, and more recently &quot;Mister No&quot; (1975), about an American pilot who operates a small tourist flying agency in the Amazonian jungle, and &quot;Martin Mystère&quot; (1982), featuring an anthropologist/archaeologist/art historian who investigates paranormal phenomena and archaeological mysteries.

Another popular series, &quot;Diabolik&quot; featuring a criminal mastermind, has been published since the 1960s, and influenced later series such as &quot;Kriminal&quot; and &quot;Satanik&quot; (see &quot;Fumetti neri&quot;). The latter was created in the 1960s by one of the most famous duos of comics history, Magnus &amp; Bunker, whose most outstanding creation, however, is the humorous espionage series &quot;Alan Ford&quot; (1969).

Another famous author of humouristic strips is Franco Bonvicini, whose &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; met wide success abroad.

In the 1970s and early &#x27;80s, many young intellectual artists centred around the famous student city of Bologna began to be influenced by the underground comic scene of the United States, typified by the work of Robert Crumb. Artists such as Andrea Pazienza, Filippo Scòzzari, Stefano Tamburini, Tanino Liberatore, and Massimo Mattioli published stories with dark and surreal themes, ranging from political activism, to struggles with drug addiction and the &quot;disagio&quot; and disillusionment of youth culture in Italy. Many of the comics were extremely violent and sexual and attempted to stretch the comic genre to its vary limits in both style and &quot;good taste.&quot; Satirical magazines such as &quot;Frigidaire&quot; and &quot;Il Male&quot; often printed these stories in episodic formats or as vignettes in their monthly publications.

Though read by a more restricted audience, in the past years comics series with the greatest critical success are &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;, by Hugo Pratt, and &quot;Valentina&quot; by Guido Crepax. While the former is a kind of &quot;summa&quot; of the evolution into an adult form of the classic adventure comics, the latter gave birth to that special kind of erotic comics quite typical of the Italian scene, and whose main pupils have been in more recent years Milo Manara and Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri.

===Disney Italia===
Italy also produces many Disney comics, i.e., stories featuring Disney characters (from Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes). After the 1960s, American artists of Disney comics, such as Carl Barks and Floyd Gottfredson did not produce as many stories as in the past. At present American production of new stories has dwindled (Don Rosa publishes in Europe), and this niche has been filled by companies in South America, Denmark and Italy. The Italian &#x27;Scuola disneyana&#x27; has produced several innovations: building the Italian standard length for stories (30 pages), a pocket book format with 3 strips a page, reinterpreting famous works of literature in &#x27;Parodie&#x27;, long stories up to 400 pages.

Among the most important artists and authors are Marco Rota, Romano Scarpa, Giorgio Cavazzano, Massimo De Vita, Giovan Battista Carpi and Guido Martina. The best known Disney character created in Italy is &quot;Paperinik&quot; (known as Duck Avenger or Phantom Duck to English audiences).

Italy prints around 8000 pages of new Disney stories per year, exported worldwide (it makes up 50% of the total production). The main publication, digest size &quot;Topolino&quot;, prints only new stories every week, but there exist 32 different series of reprints going on, for 30 million of copies sold each year.
Since the late 1990s, Disney Italia produced innovative series like &quot;PK&quot; (Paperinik stories with an American superheroes flavour), &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; or &quot;Monster Allergy&quot;.

<doc id="1181469" wikidata="Q1797740" url="?curid=1181469" title="RMS Republic (1903)">
<text>RMS &quot;Republic&quot; was a steam-powered ocean liner built in 1903 by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, and lost at sea in a collision in 1909 while sailing for the White Star Line. The ship was equipped with a new Marconi wireless telegraphy transmitter, and issued a CQD distress call, resulting in the saving of around 1,500 lives. Known as the &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Ship&quot; because of the number of wealthy Americans who traveled by her, she was described as a &quot;palatial liner&quot; and was the flagship of White Star Line&#x27;s Boston service. This was the first important marine rescue made possible by radio, and brought worldwide attention to this new technology.

==History==

===White Star acquisition===
The ship was originally built in Belfast, Ireland, for the International Mercantile Marine&#x27;s Dominion Line (a sister company to the White Star Line) and was named . She was launched on 26 February 1903, and made her maiden voyage in October 1903 from Liverpool to Boston. After two voyages with the Dominion Line, &quot;Columbus&quot;, along with three other Dominion liners: &quot;New England&quot;, , and , were sold to the White Star Line for use on their new service between Liverpool and Boston. &quot;Columbus&quot; was renamed &quot;Republic&quot;, the second ship under White Star livery to hold the name (White Star&#x27;s original of 1872 had been sold to the Holland America Line in 1889 and renamed &quot;Maasdam&quot;), while her three fellow former Dominion liners were renamed &quot;Romanic&quot;, &quot;Canopic&quot;, and &quot;Cretic&quot;, respectively.

===Collision with SS &quot;Florida&quot;===

In the early morning of 23 January 1909, while sailing from New York City to Gibraltar and Mediterranean ports with 742 passengers and crew and Captain Inman Sealby (1862–1942) in command, &quot;Republic&quot; entered a thick fog off the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Amongst the passengers were some illustrious people, such as James Ross Mellon, his wife Rachel Hughey Larimer Mellon, their daughter Sarah of the Mellon banking family and family maid, Mrs. Sophie Mansfield Curtis, wife of George Munson Curtis (treasurer of the International Silver Company), Mrs. Mary Harriman Severance, wife of Cordenio A. Severance, Professor John M. Coulter with wife and children, General Brayton Ives, St. Louis millionaire Samuel Cupples, historian Alice Morse Earle, and Mildred Montague, Countess Pasolini. Travelling in first class were also Mr. Leonard L. McMurray, who, in 1915, would survive the sinking of the Cunard liner , and Mrs. Bessie Armstead Davis, daughter-in-law of senator Henry G. Davis of West Virginia with two children.

Taking standard precautions and maintaining her speed, the steamer regularly signaled her presence in the outbound shipping traffic lane by whistle. At 5:47 a.m., another whistle was heard and &quot;Republic&quot;″s engines were ordered to full reverse, and the helm put &quot;hard-a-port&quot;. Out of the fog, the Lloyd Italiano liner SS &quot;Florida&quot; appeared and hit &quot;Republic&quot; amidships on her portside, at about a right angle. Two passengers asleep in their cabins on &quot;Republic&quot; were killed when &quot;Florida&quot;″s bow sliced into her, liquor wholesale manager Eugene Lynch&#x27;s wife Mary and banker William J. Mooney. Eugene Lynch was critically injured and died as a result of his injuries at Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, 26 January. On &quot;Florida&quot;, three crewmen were also killed when the bow was crushed back to a collision bulkhead. Six people died in total.

The engine and boiler rooms on &quot;Republic&quot; began to flood, and the ship listed. Captain Sealby led the crew in calmly organizing the passengers on deck for evacuation. &quot;Republic&quot; was equipped with the new Marconi wireless telegraph system, and became the first ship in history to issue a CQD distress signal, sent by John R. Binns. &quot;Florida&quot; came about to rescue &quot;Republic&quot;″s complement, and the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service cutter responded to the distress signal as well. Passengers were distributed between the two ships, with &quot;Florida&quot; taking the bulk of them, but with 900 Italian immigrants already on board, this left the ship dangerously overloaded.

The White Star liner , commanded by Captain J. B. Ranson, also responded to the CQD call, but due to the persistent fog, &quot;Baltic&quot; was not able to locate the drifting &quot;Republic&quot; until that evening. Once on-scene, the rescued passengers were transferred from &quot;Gresham&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot; to &quot;Baltic&quot;. Because of the damage to &quot;Florida&quot;, that ship&#x27;s immigrant passengers were also transferred to &quot;Baltic&quot;, but a riot nearly broke out when they had to wait until first-class &quot;Republic&quot; passengers were transferred. Once everyone was on board, &quot;Baltic&quot; sailed for New York.

At the time of &quot;Republic&quot;″s sinking, ocean liners were not required to have a full capacity of lifeboats for their passengers, officers, and crew. On the busy North Atlantic route, assistance from at least one ship was believed to be ever-present and that lifeboats would be needed only to ferry all aboard to their rescue vessels and back until everyone was safely evacuated. That scenario, unlike during the &quot;RMS Titanic&quot; sinking, played out flawlessly during the ship&#x27;s sinking, and the six people who died were lost in the collision, not the sinking itself.
Captain Sealby and a skeleton crew remained on board &quot;Republic&quot; to make an effort to save her. Crewmen from the &quot;Gresham&quot; tried using collision mats to stem the flooding, but to no avail. By this time, the steamers &quot;New York&quot; and (from Cunard) had also arrived and waited while a futile attempt was made by &quot;Gresham&quot; to take &quot;Republic&quot; under tow. On 24 January, &quot;Republic&quot; sank stern first; at 15,378 tons, she was the largest ship to have sunk until then. All the remaining crew were evacuated before she sank.

====Reported cargoes====
Some reports indicate that &quot;Republic&quot; was carrying gold and other valuables when she sank. One report is that she was carrying gold worth $250,000 in American gold coins to be used as payroll for the US Navy&#x27;s Great White Fleet.
In addition to the US Navy coin-monies shipment, various sources reported on a much larger cargo, $3,000,000 in US gold double eagles ($20). Among these, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;Three million dollars in gold coins lie in the rotting hulk of the White Star liner Republic, lost off Nantucket in January, 1909. The &quot;Republic&quot;, damaged in a collision, was being towed toward New York by the Coast Guard cutter&quot; Gresham&quot;, when she sank in 240 feet of water. A salvage attempt in 1919 was unsuccessful.&quot; And again one year later, &quot;In 1909, the [White] Star Liner Republic was damaged in a collision. While being towed to safety, she sank in over 200 feet of water. At the present, all attempts to salvage the $3,000,000 in her holds have been unsuccessful.&quot; The New York Times reported, &quot;The White Star Liner Republic, lost off Nantucket Shoals in 1909, carried $3,000,000 in gold eagles. However, the Republic rests in 185 [270] feet of water.&quot;

== Rediscovery ==
The wreck of &quot;Republic&quot; was found by Captain Martin Bayerle in 1981. the wreck lies upright roughly south of Nantucket Island at in a depth of around of water.

<text>Laura Pauline Veirs (born October 24, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter based in Portland, Oregon. She is known for her folk and alternative country records and live performances as well as her collaboration with Neko Case and k.d. lang on the case/lang/veirs project. Veirs has written a children&#x27;s book and hosts a podcast about parenting and performing.

== Early life and education ==
Veirs graduated from General William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In 1997, Veirs graduated from Carleton College, where she was a geology major and studied Mandarin Chinese. During this time, she worked as a translator for a geological expedition in China.

== Career ==

Growing up, Veirs heard folk-country, classical, and pop music at home. However, accord to herself, she did not &quot;listen seriously,&quot; until she was in her twenties.

At Carleton, she joined all-girl punk band, Rair Kx! After graduation, her taste moved to older country and folk, and during her time in China she began writing lyrics.

In 1999, Veirs released her eponymous debut studio album, which was recorded live and featuring just herself and guitar. 2003 saw the release of &quot;Troubled by the Fire&quot;, accompanied by veteran musicians such as Bill Frisell. She then signed to Nonesuch and released &quot;Carbon Glacier&quot; (2004). She also signed to Bella Union for European distribution. &quot;Year of Meteors&quot; followed in August 2005, and was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;critic&#x27;s choice&quot;.

Veirs released her final studio album for Nonesuch, &quot;Saltbreakers&quot;, in 2007.

In January 2010, Veirs released &quot;July Flame&quot; on her own Raven Marching Band Records. The album received praise from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; among other publications.

In November 2011, Veirs released the album &quot;Tumble Bee: Laura Veirs Sings Folk Songs for Children&quot;. The album presented mostly traditional songs, and featured an array of guest musicians, including Colin Meloy, Jim James and Béla Fleck. &quot;Tumble Bee&quot; won a Parents&#x27; Choice Award in 2012.

In September 2012, her first feature film soundtrack was released: &quot;Hello I Must Be Going&quot;, for the movie of the same name. The exclusive soundtrack featured eight instrumental versions of previously released songs, five catalog favorites and one new vocal track, &quot;Spring Song&quot;.

In August 2013, she released &quot;Warp &amp; Weft&quot;. In 2015, she worked on the album &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot; by Sufjan Stevens. Veirs&#x27; long term collaborator and then husband, Tucker Martine, engineered some of the album.

Veirs was lead songwriter for the 2016 album &quot;case/lang/veirs&quot;, a collaborative project between Veirs, k.d. lang and Neko Case. The album received positive reviews and a Metacritic rating of 82.

In April 2018, she released her tenth studio album &quot;The Lookout&quot; on her own label Raven Marching Band in North American and Bella Union in the rest of the world. It was a concept album about the fragility of precious things. It featured contributions from Sufjan Stevens, Jim James and was produced by Tucker Martine. Earlier, in January 2018, she had launched a podcast, &quot;Midnight Lightning&quot;, about the lives of musician parents. The first season featured weekly interviews with 14 mother musicians such as Corin Tucker (Sleater-Kinney), Carol Kaye, Rosanne Cash, Rhiannon Giddens, Meshell Ndegeocello, Amanda Bergman among others. In early 2018, Chronicle Books published her first picture book, &quot;Libba: The Magnificent Musical Life of Elizabeth Cotten&quot;. A story about the influential American folk and blues musician Elizabeth Cotten (aka &quot;Libba&quot;) it was illustrated by Tatyana Fazlalizadeh. &quot;Libba&quot; was a Junior Library Guild selection and received the Parents&#x27; Choice Award.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2020, Veirs released the song &quot;I Was a Fool&quot;, exploring her divorce. In July, her eleventh studio album &quot;My Echo&quot; was made available for pre-order with a scheduled release in October. Veirs continued to write and record, finishing most of an album&#x27;s worth of material by the time, &quot;My Echo&quot;, was released. In 2022, Veirs co-produced her first studio album &quot;Found Light&quot; with Shahzad Ismaily.

&quot;Phone Orphans&quot; was released in 2023 – this is an album of demos Veirs recorded on her iPhone. In the same year she recorded a live album at a show at Brooklyn&#x27;s The Owl Parlor. It was released 2024, called &quot;Laura Veirs and Her Band – Live in Brooklyn.&quot; It featured her band mates Shahzad Ismaily, Sam Amidon, Karl Blau and Charlotte Greve. Veirs was inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in October, 2024.

== Touring band members ==
* Laura Veirs – vocals, guitar, banjo
* Eli Moore – bass, guitar, synthesizers
* Eyvind Kang – viola
* Karl Blau – guitar, bass, saxophone, keyboards, vocals 
* Steve Moore – piano, keyboards, bells, euphonium, vocals

=== Production ===

Tucker Martine was a producer on many of the albums including &quot;Carbon Glacier, Year of Meteors,&quot; &quot;Saltbreakers&quot;, &quot;July Flame&quot;, &quot;Tumble Bee and&quot; &quot;Warp &amp; Weft&quot;.

== Raven Marching Band Records ==
Veirs runs a record label, Raven Marching Band Records, that has released her own and other artists&#x27; music. In 2016, the label released &quot;Introducing Karl Blau&quot;, which was crowdfunded.

== Style ==
In 2007, Veirs said about her lyrics, &quot;I like to be personal in my writing, but not overly confessional.&quot;

Many of her lyrics are inspired by literary works. The song &quot;Saltbreakers&quot; on her sixth studio album &quot;Saltbreakers&quot; (2007) was partially inspired by A. S. Byatt&#x27;s &quot;Possession&quot; (1990). Another song on the same album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Yourself&quot;, was partially inspired by José Saramago&#x27;s novel, &quot;Blindness&quot; (1995). T. S. Eliot was an inspiration for the song &quot;Margaret Sands&quot; on &quot;The Lookout&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Veirs lives in Portland, Oregon. Around 2000, Veirs married Tucker Martine, who has collaborated with her musically. Veirs and Martine had two children, born 2010 and 2013. In November 2019, Veirs announced she and Martine were divorcing. In the summer of 2024, Veirs announced her engagement to Reed College music professor and ethnomusicologist Morgan Luker.

<doc id="1181475" wikidata="Q1051868" url="?curid=1181475" title="Albanian literature">
<text>Albanian literature stretches back to the Middle Ages and comprises those literary texts and works written in Albanian. It may also refer to literature written by Albanians in Albania, Kosovo and the Albanian diaspora particularly in Italy. Albanian occupies an independent branch within the Indo-European family and does not have any other closely related language. The origin of Albanian is not entirely known, but it may be a successor of the ancient Illyrian language.

The Archbishop of Antivari Guillaume Adam wrote a report in 1332 in which he said that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from the Latin language.

The oldest surviving documents written in Albanian are the &quot;Formula e pagëzimit&quot; (Baptismal formula) recorded by Pal Engjëlli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some New Testament verses from that period.

== Medieval period ==

=== 15th century ===
The expansion of the Ottoman Empire pushed many Albanians from their homeland during the period of the Western European Renaissance humanism. Among the Albanian émigrés that became known in the humanist world are historian Marin Barleti (1460–1513) who in 1510 published in Rome a history of Skanderbeg, which was translated into many other European languages, or Marino Becichemi (1468–1526), Gjon Gazulli (1400–1455), Leonicus Thomeus (1456–1531), Michele Maruli (15th century), Michele Artioti (1480–1556) and many others who were distinguished in various fields of science, art and philosophy.

=== 16th century ===

The cultural resistance was first of all expressed through the elaboration of Albanian in the area of church sacrifices and publications, mainly of the Catholic confessional region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku translated the Catholic liturgy into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what Luther did for German.

&quot;Meshari&quot; (The Missal) by Gjon Buzuku, published by him in 1555, is the first literary work published in Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be a result of an earlier tradition of writing Albanian, a tradition that is not known. But there is some fragmented evidence, dating earlier than Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written at least since the 14th century AD. The first known evidence dates from 1332 AD and deals with the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who in a report in Latin writes that Albanians use Latin letters in their books although their language is quite different from Latin. Of special importance in supporting this are: a baptizing formula (&quot;Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit&quot;) of 1462, written in Albanian within a text in Latin by the bishop of Durrës, Pal Engjëlli; a glossary with Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment from the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but in Greek letters.

Albanian writings of these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist Marin Barleti, who, in his book &quot;The Siege of Shkodra&quot; (&quot;De Obsidione Scodrensi&quot;) (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (&quot;in vernacula lingua&quot;). Despite the obstacles generated by the Counter-Reformation which was opposed to the development of national languages in Christian liturgy, this process went on uninterrupted. During the 16th to 17th centuries, the catechism &quot;E mbësuame krishterë&quot; (Christian Teachings) (1592) by Lekë Matrënga, &quot;Doktrina e krishterë&quot; (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and &quot;Rituale romanum&quot; (1621) by Pjetër Budi, the first writer of original Albanian prose and poetry, an apology for George Castriot (1636) by Frang Bardhi, who also published a dictionary and folklore creations, the theological-philosophical treaty &quot;Cuneus Prophetarum&quot; (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by Pjetër Bogdani, the most universal personality of Albanian Middle Ages, were published in Albanian.

Bogdani&#x27;s work is a theological-philosophical treatise that considers with originality, by merging data from various sources, principal issues of theology, a full biblical history and the complicated problems of scholasticism, cosmogony, astronomy, pedagogy, etc. Bogdani brought into Albanian culture the humanist spirit and praised the role of knowledge and culture in the life of man; with his written work in a language of polished style, he marked a turning point in the history of Albanian literature.

Another important writer of the Early Albanian Literature was Jul Variboba.

=== 17th century ===

During 17th and 18th centuries, the literature of Orthodox and Muslim confessional cultural circles witnessed a greater development. An anonymous writer from Elbasan translated into Albanian a number of sections from the Bible; T. H. Filipi, also from Elbasan, brings the &quot;Dhiata e Vjetër dhe e Re&quot; (The Old and the New Testament). These efforts multiplied in the following century with the publication in 1827 of the integral text of the &quot;Dhiata e Re&quot; (The New Testament) by G. Gjirokastriti and with the big corpus of (Christian) religious translations by Kostandin Kristoforidhi (1830–1895), in both main dialects of Albanian, publications which helped in the process of integrating the two dialects into a unified literary language and in setting up the basis for the establishment of the National Church of the Albanians with the liturgy in their own language.

Although in opposite direction with this tendency, the culture of Voskopoja is also to be mentioned, a culture that during the 17th century became a great hearth of civilization and a metropolis of the Balkan peninsula, with an Academy and a printing press and with personalities like T. Kavaljoti, Dh. Haxhiu, G. Voskopojari, whose works of knowledge, philology, theology and philosophy assisted objectively in the writing and recognition of Albanian. Although the literature that evolved in Voskopoja was mainly in Greek, the need to erect obstacles to Islamization made necessary the use of national languages, encouraging the development of national cultures. Walachian and Albanian were also used for the teaching of Greek in the schools of Voskopoja, and books in Walachian were also printed in its printing presses. The works of Voskopoja writers and savants have brought in some elements of the ideas of the European Enlightenment. The most distinguished of them was Teodor Kavaljoti. According to the notes of H.E. Thunman, the work of Kavaljoti, which remained unpublished, in most part deals with issues from almost all branches of philosophy. It shows the influence of Plato, Descartes, Malebranche and Leibniz.

== Early Modern period ==
One of the results of the influence of Islam and particularly Sufi orders, and the culture of the invader, was the emergence of a school of poetry known as the school of the bejtexhinj during the 18th century, or of a literature written in Albanian but by means of an Arabic alphabet. Its authors such as Nezim Frakulla, Sulejman Naibi, Hasan Zyko Kamberi, Shahin and Dalip Frashëri, and others dealt in their works with motifs borrowed from Oriental literature, wrote religious texts and poetry in a language suffocated by orientalisms and developed religious lyric and epic. The poetry of the bejtexhinj was strongly influenced by Turkish, Persian and Arabic literary models in fashion at the time both in Istanbul and the Middle east. Most of the genres and forms prevalent in Turkish and Persian verse are to be encountered in Albanian. There are either as isolated poems or within the divans: the murabba&#x27;, quatrain; the ilahi, religious hymns; the qaside, the longer panegyric odes favoured by the Arabs; and the ghazal, shorter poems, often love lyrics which were favoured by the Turks and Persians. The subject matter was often religious, either meditatively intimate or openly didactic, serving to spread the faith. The speculative character of much of this verse derived its inspiration from the currents of Islam: from Sunnite spirituality to the intense mystical spheres of Shi&#x27;ite Sufism and later, to the more liberal, though equally mystical reflections of Bektashi pantheism. Secular verses occur as well: love lyrics, nature poetry and historical and philosophical verse.

The first major poet among the bejtexhinj was Nezim Frakulla (1680–1760) who wrote his first poetry in Turkish, Persian and Arabic including two divans. Between 1731 and 1735 he composed a divan and various other poetry in Albanian, as well as an Albanian- Turkish dictionary in verse form. His divan include verse ranging from panegyrics on local pashas and military campaigns, to odes on friends and patrons, poems on separation from and longing for his friends and lovers, description of nature in the springtime, religious verse, and in particular, love lyrics.

Another famous bejtexhinj is Hasan Zyko Kamberi who was one of the most commanding representatives of the Muslim tradition in Albanian literature, through his main work, a 200-page (verse collection). Kamberi&#x27;s secular verse covers a wide range of themes.

=== 19th century ===
The 19th century, the century of national movements in the Balkans, found Albanians without a sufficient tradition of a unitary development of the state, language and culture but, instead, with an individualistic and regionalist mentality inherited from the supremacy of clan and kinship and consequently with an underdeveloped national conscience, though with a spirit of spontaneous rebellion. In this historical cultural situation emerged and fully developed an organized ideological, military and literary movement, called &quot;Rilindja Kombëtare&quot; (National Renaissance). It was inspired by the ideas of National Romanticism and Enlightenment, which were cultivated among the circles of Albanian intelligentsia, mainly émigrés in the old settlements in Italy and the more recent ones in Istanbul, Bucharest, United States, Sofia and Cairo.

National Renaissance, nurturing the Albanian as a language of culture, the organization of national education and the establishment of a national literature on the cultural level as well as the creation of the independent state – these were the goals of this movement which gave birth to the school of Albanian Romanticism. It was imbued with the spirit of national liberation, with the nostalgia of the émigré and the rhetorical pathos of past heroic wars. This literary school developed the poetry most. Regarding the motifs and poetical forms, its hero was the ethical man, the fighting Albanian, and to a lesser degree the tragic man. It is closely linked with the folklore tradition.

The pursuit of this tradition and the publications of &quot;Rapsodi të një poeme arbëreshe&quot; (Rhapsody of an Arbëresh Poem) in 1866 by Jeronim De Rada, of &quot;Përmbledhje të këngëve popullore dhe rapsodi të poemave shqiptare&quot; (Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies of Albanian Poems) in 1871 by Zef Jubani, &quot;Bleta shqiptare&quot; (Albanian Bee) in 1878 by Thimi Mitko, etc., were part of the cultural programme of the National Renaissance for establishing a compact ethnic and cultural identity of Albanians.

Two are the greatest representatives of Albanian Romanticism of 19th century: Jeronim De Rada (1814–1903), and Naim Frashëri (1846–1900), born in Albania, educated at Zosimea of Ioannina, but emigrated and deceased in Istanbul. The first is the Albanian romantic poet brought up in the climate of European Romanticism, the second is the Albanian romanticist and pantheist who merges in his poetry the influence of Eastern poetry, especially Persian, with the spirit of the poetry of Western Romanticism.

De Rada wrote a cycle of epical-lyrical poems in the style of Albanian rhapsodies: &quot;Këngët e Milosaos&quot; (The Songs of Milosao), 1836, &quot;Serafina Topia&quot; 1839, &quot;Skënderbeu i pafat&quot; (Unlucky Skanderbeg) 1872–1874 etc. with the ambition of creating the national epos for the century of Skanderbeg. Following the traces of Johann Gottfried Herder, De Rada raised the love for folk songs in his poetry and painted it in ethnographic colours. His works reflect both Albanian life with its characteristic customs and mentalities, and the Albanian drama of the 15th century, when Albania came under Ottoman rule. The conflict between the happiness of the individual and the tragedy of the nation, the scenes by the riversides, women gathering wheat in the fields, the man going to war and the wife embroidering his belt, all represented with a delicate lyrical feeling.

Naim Frashëri wrote a pastoral poem &quot;Bagëti e bujqësia&quot; (Shepherds and Farmers) (1886), a collection of philosophical, patriotic and love lyrics &quot;Lulet e verës&quot; (Summer Flowers), (1890), an epical poem on Skanderbeg &quot;Histori e Skënderbeut&quot; (The History of Skanderbeg) (1898), a religious epical poem &quot;Qerbelaja&quot; (1898), two poems in Greek &quot;O Eros&quot; (i.e. O Love) and (i.e. The True Desire of Albanians), some lyrics in Persian &quot;Tehajylat&quot; (The Dream) and many erudite works in Albanian. He is recognised as the greatest national poet of Albanians. Frashëri established modern lyrics in Albanian poetry. In the spirit of &quot;Bucolics&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil, in his (Shepherds and Farmers) he sang to the works of the land tiller and shepherd by writing a hymn to the beauties of his fatherland and expressing the nostalgia of the émigré poet and the pride of being Albanian. The longing for his birthplace, the mountains and fields of Albania, the graves of his ancestors, the memories of his childhood, feed his inspiration with lyrical strength and impulse.

The inner experiences of the individual freed from the chains of medieval, Oriental mentality on one hand and the philosophical pantheism imbued with the poetical pantheism of the European Romanticism on the other hand, give to the lyrical meditations of Frashëri a universal human and philosophical dimension. The most beautiful poems of &quot;Lulet e verës&quot; (Summer Flowers) collection are the philosophical lyrics on life and death, on time that goes by and never comes back leaving behind tormenting memories in the heart of man, on the Creator melt with the Universe. Naim Frashëri is the founder of the national literature of the Albanians and of the national literary language. He raised Albanian to a modern language of culture, evolving it in the model of the popular speech.

The world of the romantic hero with its vehement feelings is brought to Albanian Romanticism by the poetry of Zef Serembe. The poetry of Ndre Mjeda and Andon Zako Çajupi, who lived at the end of Renaissance, bears the signs of disintegration of the artistic system of Romanticism in Albanian literature.

Çajupi (1866–1930) is a rustic poet, the type of a folk bard, called the Mistral of Albania; he brought to Albanian literature the comedy of customs and the tragedy of historical themes. Graduated from a French college in Alexandria and the Geneva University, a good connoisseur of French literature, Çajupi was among the first translate La Fontaine&#x27;s fables into Albanian, thus opening the way to the translation and adoption of works of world literature into Albanian, which has been and remains one of the major ways of communication with the world culture.

Distinguished writers of this period are: Naum Veqilharxhi, Sami Frashëri, Vaso Pasha, Jeronim de Rada, Gavril Dara the Younger, Zef Serembe, Naim Frashëri, Dora d&#x27;Istria, Andon Zako Çajupi, Ndre Mjeda, Luigj Gurakuqi, Filip Shiroka, Mihal Grameno, Risto Siliqi, Aleksandër Stavre Drenova, etc.

== Modern period ==

=== Independence ===

The main direction taken by the Albanian literature between the two World Wars was realism, but it also bore remnants of romanticism.

Gjergj Fishta (1871–1940), wrote a poem of national epos breadth &quot;The Highland Lute&quot; (&quot;Lahuta e malësisë&quot;) in 17.000 verses, in the spirit of Albanian historical and legendary epos, depicting the struggles of Northern highlanders against Slav onslaughts. With this work he remains the greatest epical poet of Albanians. A Franciscan priest, erudite and a member of the Italian Academy, Gjergj Fishta is a multifaceted personality of Albanian culture: epical and lyrical poet, publicist and satirist, dramatist and translator, active participant in the Albanian cultural and political life between the two Wars. His major work, &quot;The Highland Lute&quot; (1937, english edition 2005), is a reflection of the Albanian life and mentality, a poetical mosaic of historic and legendary exploits, traditions and customs of the highlands, a live fresco of the history of an old people, which places on its center the type of Albanian carved in the calvary of his life along the stream of centuries which had been savage to him. Fishta&#x27;s poem is distinguished by its vast linguistic wealth, is a receptacle for the richness of the popular speech of the highlands, the live and infinite phraseology and the diversity of clear syntax constructions, which give vitality and strength to the poetic expression. The poetical collections &quot;Mrizi i Zanave&quot; (The Fairies&#x27; Mead) with patriotic verse and &quot;Vallja e Parrizit&quot; (Paris&#x27;s Dance) with verses of a religious spirit, represent Fishta as a refined lyrical poet, while his other works &quot;Anzat e Parnasit&quot; (Parnassus&#x27; Anises) and &quot;Gomari i Babatasit&quot; (Babatas&#x27; Donkey) represent him as an unrepeatable satirical poet. In the field of drama, &quot;Juda Makabe&quot; and &quot;Ifigjenia n&#x27; Aulli&quot; may be mentioned along his tragedies with biblical and mythological themes.
The typical representative of realism was Millosh Gjergj Nikolla, Migjeni (1913–1938). His poetry &quot;Free Verse&quot; (&quot;Vargjet e lira&quot;, 1936; English, 2015), and prose are permeated by a severe socialist realism on the misery and tragic position of the individual in the society of the time. The characters of his works are people from the lowest strata of Albanian society. Some of Migjeni&#x27;s stories are novels in miniature; their themes represent the conflict of the individual with institutions and the patriarchal and conservative morality. The rebellious nature of Migjeni&#x27;s talent broke the traditionalism of Albanian poetry and prose by bringing a new style and forms in poetry and narrative. He is one of the greatest reformers of Albanian literature, the first great modern Albanian writer.

Lasgush Poradeci (1899–1987), a poetical talent of a different nature, a brilliant lyrical poet, wrote soft and warm poetry, but with a deep thinking and a charming musicality &quot;Vallja e yjeve&quot; (The Dance of Stars), 1933, &quot;Ylli i zemrës&quot; (The Star of Heart), 1937.

Fan Stilian Noli (1882–1965) F.S. Noli is one of the most versatile figures—he was a distinguished poet, historian, dramatist, aesthete and musicologist, publicist, translator and master of Albanian. With his poetry, non-fiction, scientific and religious prose, as well as with his translations, Noli has played a fundamental role in the development of the modern Albanian. His introductions to his own translations of world literature made him Albania&#x27;s foremost literary critic of the inter-war period. He wrote the plays &quot;The Awakening&quot; and &quot;Israelites and Philistines&quot; and in 1947 he published in English the study &quot;Beethoven and the French Revolution&quot;.

Albanian literature between the two Wars did not lack manifestations of sentimentalism (Foqion Postoli, Mihal Grameno) and of belated classicism, especially in drama (Et&#x27;hem Haxhiademi). Manifestations of the modern trends, impressionism, Symbolism, etc. were isolated phenomena in the works of some writers (Migjeni, Poradeci, and Asdreni), that did not succeed in forming a school. Deep changes were seen in the system of genres; prose (Migjeni, F. S. Noli, Faik Konitza, Ernest Koliqi, Mitrush Kuteli, etc.) drama and satire (Gjergj Fishta, Kristo Floqi) developed parallel to poetry. Ernest Koliqi wrote subtle prose, full of coloring from his town of Shkodër, (&quot;Tregtar flamujsh&quot;, (Trader of Flags), 1935. Mitrush Kuteli is a magician of Albanian, the writer that cultivated the folk style of narration into a charming prose, &quot;Net shqiptare&quot; (Albanian Nights) 1938; &quot;Ago Jakupi&quot; 1943; &quot;Kapllan aga i Shaban Shpatës&quot; (Kapllan Aga of Shaban Shpata), 1944.

Faik Konica is the master who gave Albanian prose a modern image. Coming from a renowned family, inheriting the conscience of belonging to an elite, which he manifested strongly in his life and work, he discarded Oriental mentality, inherited from the Ottoman occupation, with a joking smile that he translated into a cutting sarcasm in his work. Erudite, knowledgeable in all major European languages and some Eastern ones, a friend of Guillaume Apollinaire, called by foreigners &quot;a walking encyclopaedia&quot;, Konitza became the model of Western intellectual for the Albanian culture. Since his youth he was dedicated to the national movement, but contrary to the mythical, idealising and romanticising feeling of the Renaissance, he brought in it the spirit of criticism and experienced the perennial pain of the idealist who suffers for his own thoughts. He established the &quot;Albania&quot; magazine (Brussels 1897–1900, London 1902–1909), that became the most important Albanian press organ of the Renaissance. Publicist, essayist, poet, prose writer, translator and literary critic, he, among others, is the author of the studies &quot;L&#x27;Albanie et les Turcs&quot; (Paris 1895), &quot;Memoire sur le mouvement national Albanais&quot; (Brussels, 1899), of novels &quot;Një ambasadë e zulluve në Paris&quot; (An Embassy of the Zulu in Paris) (1922) and &quot;Doktor Gjilpëra&quot; (Doctor Needle) (1924), as well as of the historical-cultural work &quot;Albania—the Rock Garden of South-Eastern Europe&quot; published posthumously in Massachusetts in 1957.

The literature of the Albanians of Italy in the period between the two Wars continued the tradition of the romanticist school of the 19th century. Zef Skiro (1865–1927) through his work &quot;Kthimi&quot; (Return), 1913, &quot;Te dheu i huaj&quot; (In Foreign Soil), 1940, wanted to recover the historical memory of Albanians emigrated since the 15th century after the death of Skanderbeg.

Also another distinguished writer of Albanian Romanticism who was published in Albania and abroad was, Lazar Eftimiadhi. A graduate of Sorbone, he wrote several articles introducing the Albanian reader to major works of western literature. He also translated works of writers like Hans Christian Andersen, and collaborated with at Gjergj Fishta and others in many important translations. His collection of short stories titled &quot;Merushja&quot; is a pearl of Albanian Romanticism and Humanity and was published by several houses including a 1932 London Edition.

Distinguished writers of this period are: Fan Stilian Noli, Gjergj Fishta, Faik Konitza, Haki Stërmilli, Lasgush Poradeci, Mitrush Kuteli, Migjeni, etc.

== Socialism==
The drastic political change after the Communist takeover in Albania interrupted connections to pre-WWII literary traditions. The new regime had an extremely suspicious attitude towards intellectuals and writers, who were seen as representatives of the &quot;old regime&quot;. Those years were characterized by notorious witch hunts against writers. The practices and policies undertaken by Stalin in the 1930s in the Soviet Union were applied in Albania throughout the 46 years of Communist rule.

In the political and cultural context of Communist Albania, writers could choose either complete obedience and service to the regime, compromise with clans in the Albanian Writers Union, or stop publishing their works. The later option led to the creation of the &quot;literature of the drawers&quot;. Yet very few writers were able to hide their works due to the strict surveillance from the Communist authorities, and no one was able to circulate their works illegally, so samizdat were non-existent throughout the Communist period in Albania. Any writers deemed suspicious by the authorities were arrested, imprisoned, or executed, with or without trial.

The literature of this period developed within the framework of Socialist Realism, the only direction allowed by official policy. Albanian writers had to focus on the partisan war and the efforts to build socialism, and also prevent the influence of &quot;decadent&quot; Western culture. Subjects which did not contribute to Communist ideology and politics were deemed taboo. The very treatment of taboo subjects in a conformist manner amounted to extreme dissent.

The most elaborate type of novel was the novel of Socialist Realism of ethical and historical character, with a linear subject matter (Jakov Xoxa, Sterjo Spasse, Fatmir Gjata), but novels with a rugged composition, open poetics, and a philosophical substratum issuing from association of ideas and historical analogies (Ismail Kadare, Petro Marko) as well as the satirical novel are not lacking. A satirical novel is &quot;The Rise and Fall of Comrade Zylo&quot; by Dritëro Agolli.

The short story and novel were developed by Dhimitër Shuteriqi, Teodor Laço, Dhimitër Xhuvani, Petraq Zoto, and others; poetry by Ismail Kadare, Dritëro Agolli, Fatos Arapi, Xhevahir Spahiu, Mimoza Ahmeti, and others. Drama and comedy (by Spiro Çomora, &quot;Karnavalet e Korçës&quot; (The Carnival of Korça), 1961) developed to a lesser degree.

== Contemporary period ==

Albania&#x27;s best-known contemporary writer is Ismail Kadare (1936–2024) whose novels have been translated into 45 languages. With his novels &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot; (1963), &quot;The Siege&quot; (1970), &quot;Chronicle in Stone&quot; (1971), &quot;The Three-Arched Bridge&quot; (1978), &quot;Broken April&quot; (1980), &quot;The File on H.&quot; (1981), &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; (1981), &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (1992); and &quot;The Successor&quot; (2002), Kadare brought Albanian literature into the mainstream of modern European literature.

The central theme of Kadare&#x27;s works is totalitarianism and its mechanisms. His work represents an artistic encyclopedia of Albanian life. The philosophy, beliefs, dramas, and historical and cultural traditions of Albania, filtered through the artistry of the writer, in Kadare&#x27;s work, express the vitality of the spiritual culture of the Albanian people. Kadare creates a modern prose making wide use of historical analogies, parables and associations, Albanian legends and mythology. Starting from the epic world of medieval legends and ballads, the prose of Kadare brings ancient folk traditions &#x27;up to date&#x27; by showing their relevance to the modern world.

In 1992 Kadare was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca; in 1998, the Herder Prize; in 2005, the inaugural Man Booker International Prize; in 2009, the Prince of Asturias Award of Arts; and in 2015, the Jerusalem Prize. He was awarded the Park Kyong-ni Prize in 2019, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2020. In 1996, France made him a foreign associate of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France, and in 2016, he was a &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; recipient. He has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 15 times. Since the 1990s, Kadare has been asked by both major political parties in Albania to become a consensual President of Albania, but has declined.

His nominating juror for the Neustadt Prize wrote: &quot;Kadare is the successor of Franz Kafka. No one since Kafka has delved into the infernal mechanism of totalitarian power and its impact on the human soul in as much hypnotic depth as Kadare.&quot; His writing has also been compared to that of Nikolai Gogol, George Orwell, Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera, and Balzac. Living in Albania during a time of strict censorship, Kadare devised cunning stratagems to outwit Communist censors who had banned three of his books, using devices such as parable, myth, fable, folk-tale, allegory, and legend, sprinkled with double-entendre, allusion, insinuation, satire, and coded messages. In 1990, to escape the Communist regime and its &quot;Sigurimi&quot; secret police he defected to Paris. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he was a national figure in Albania comparable in popularity perhaps to Mark Twain in the United States, and that &quot;there is hardly an Albanian household without a Kadare book.&quot; Kadare is regarded by some as one of the greatest writers and intellectuals of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Ridvan Dibra is a leading figure of contemporary Albanian literature, and author of several innovative works. He has been rewarded with several national and international prizes, including the &quot;Rexhai Surroi Prize&quot; for the best Albanian novel of the year 2012, for his novel, &quot;Legjenda e vetmisë&quot; (The Legend of Solitude).

Luljeta Lleshanaku is one of the most important and most acclaimed Albanian poets today. She&#x27;s the author of seven volumes of poetry, a couple of which have been translated in various languages. English translations include: &quot;Fresco&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot;Child of Nature&quot;(2010), &quot;Haywire: New and Selected Poems&quot; (2011) and &quot;Negative Space&quot;&quot;(2018), the translation of which by Ani Gjika has been shortlisted for the 2019 Griffin Poetry Prize. She received the 2009 Crystal Vilenica Award for European poets. 

Fatos Kongoli, born in 1944 in Elbasan, is considered to be one of the most &quot;forceful and convincing&quot; representatives of contemporary Albanian literature. During the Stalinist dictatorship in Albania he did not write or publish any important works. He came to prominence after the regime fell, with his novel &quot;The Loser&quot; (1992). His novels deal with the years of the Hoxha regime and the aftermath, as Albanian society transitions into a democracy without being able to shake off the demons of the past.

Other important writers include Ben Blushi, whose debut novel &quot;Living on an Island&quot; (2008), dealing with the Islamization of Albanians, went on to become a best-selling book after the fall of Communism in Albania. His second novel, &quot;Otello, the Moor of Vlora&quot; (2009), was awarded the European Union Prize for Literature. His later novels went on to become national bestsellers.

Ag Apolloni (born 13 June 1982) is an Albanian writer, poet, playwright, scholar, and essay writer. He is a professor at the University of Prishtina, Kosovo. His literary works are widely acclaimed for their dramatic dimension, philosophical treatment, and critical attitude towards history, politics, and society.
In 2020 he was granted citizenship of Albania.

<doc id="1181481" wikidata="Q2300560" url="?curid=1181481" title="Clip (firearms)">
<text>A clip is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit for insertion into the magazine or cylinder of a firearm. This speeds up the process by loading the firearm with multiple rounds simultaneously, rather than individually, as with loose rounds of ammunition. There are several types, most made of inexpensive stamped sheet metal, generally they are intended to be disposable, but they are more often retained and reused.

==Types==
===Stripper===

A stripper clip (American English) or charger clip (Commonwealth English) is a speedloader that holds several pistol or rifle cartridges as a unit for easier loading into a firearm&#x27;s internal box magazine. After the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally in a slot on the receiver or bolt), the cartridges are pressed down, removing or &quot;stripping&quot; them off the clip and into the magazine. The clip is then either removed and tossed away, or the bolt is thrown forward, expelling the clip automatically. However, some weapons, such as the Mosin–Nagant, require the operator to manually remove the empty clip. Some weapons designed for stripper clip use include the Mannlicher M1894, Mauser C96, Roth–Steyr M1907, Lee-Enfield, Mosin–Nagant, Gewehr 98, M1903 Springfield, SKS, Vz. 58 and T48 rifle. Detachable magazines may also be loaded with stripper clips provided they have a special guide attached, as in the M14 rifle or M16 rifle.

===&quot;En bloc&quot;===

Several rifle designs utilize an &quot;en bloc&quot; clip for loading. With this design, both the cartridges and clip are inserted as a unit into a fixed magazine within the rifle, and the clip is usually ejected or falls from the rifle upon firing or chambering of the last round. The &quot;en bloc&quot; clip was invented by Ferdinand Mannlicher for use in his Model 1885, Model 1886, and 1888 rifles.

Other rifles utilizing &quot;en bloc&quot; clips include the German Gewehr 88 (since 1905 replaced by stripper clips), the Mexican Mondragón, the French Berthier Mle 1890 and RSC Mle 1917, the Italian M1870/87 Vetterli-Vitali, and M1891 Carcano, the various (Romanian, Dutch, and Portuguese) turn-bolt Mannlichers, the Austro-Hungarian straight-pull Steyr-Mannlicher M1895, the Hungarian FÉG 35M, and the American M1895 Lee Navy, M1 Garand, and Pedersen T1E3. Original Austrian Mannlicher clips were often uni-directional, but already the Gewehr 88 and subsequently the M1891 Carcano used symmetrical clips. John Pedersen at first developed a irreversible clip for his rifle, later he redesigned the clip to be reversible. This design was also utilized for the competing designs by John Garand.

===Moon and half-moon===

A moon clip is a ring-shaped or stellate piece of metal designed to hold a full cylinder of ammunition for a revolver (commonly 6 rounds) together as a unit. Therefore, instead of loading or extracting one round at a time, a full cylinder of ammunition or spent cases can be loaded or extracted at once, speeding the loading process. A similar device known as a &quot;half-moon clip&quot; is semi-circular and designed to hold a half cylinder of ammunition (commonly 3 rounds) in which case two clips are necessary to fully load the cylinder. Such devices have most often been used to chamber rimless semi-automatic pistol cartridges into a revolver, but they can also be used with rimmed cartridges to allow for the faster loading and/or unloading of a revolver.

<doc id="1181487" wikidata="Q137802" url="?curid=1181487" title="Halo 3">
<text>Halo 3 is a 2007 first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie for the Xbox 360 console. The third installment in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise following &quot;&quot; (2001) and &quot;Halo 2&quot; (2004), the game&#x27;s story centers on the interstellar war between 26th-century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite known as the Flood. The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. In cooperative play, other human players assume the role of allied alien soldiers. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements familiar and new to the series, as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor—a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.

&quot;Halo 2&quot; had originally been intended to wrap up the story begun with &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, but development difficulties led to a cliffhanger ending. Bungie began developing &quot;Halo 3&quot; shortly after &quot;Halo 2&quot; shipped. The game was officially announced at E3 2006, and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game &quot;Crackdown&quot;. Microsoft spent $40million on marketing the game, in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established &quot;Halo&quot; fanbase. Marketing included cross-promotions and an alternate reality game. 

&quot;Halo 3&quot; was released on September 25 and grossed US$170million on its first day of release, rising to $300million in its first week. The game sold in excess of 14.5 million copies and was the best-selling video game of 2007 in the United States. More than one million people played &quot;Halo 3&quot; on Xbox Live in the first twenty hours. Overall, the game was well received by critics, with the Forge and multiplayer offerings singled out as strong features; however, some reviewers criticized single-player aspects, especially the plot and campaign layout. &quot;Halo 3&quot; is frequently listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. A sequel, &quot;Halo 4&quot;, released in November 2012, was developed by 343 Industries. &quot;Halo 3&quot; was re-released as part of &quot;&quot; for the Xbox One in November 2014 and for Windows on July 14, 2020.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Halo 3&quot; is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. Gameplay focuses on the &quot;Golden Triangle of &quot;Halo&quot;&quot;: players utilize weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons for additional firepower, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks. Unlike previous installments, the player&#x27;s secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player&#x27;s back. &quot;Halo 3&quot; introduces support weapons, cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player when carried, but offer greatly increased firepower in return.

In addition to weapons, &quot;Halo 3&quot; contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game&#x27;s vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.

&quot;Halo 3&quot; contains non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables players to insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates, and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects can be placed and moved on maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time. A budget limits the number of objects that can be placed. Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360&#x27;s hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. &quot;Halo 3&quot; offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie&#x27;s official website. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie&#x27;s website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on &quot;Halo 3&quot;.

=== Modes ===
&quot;Halo 3&quot;″s story or campaign mode can be played alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of each player being an identical character in cooperative play, as in previous &quot;Halo&quot; games, the first player plays as Master Chief, the second player as the Arbiter, and the final two players controlling the Covenant Elites N&#x27;tho &#x27;Sraom and Usze &#x27;Taham. Each player has identical abilities, although their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, as well as the difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.

Local area network or Xbox Live supports up to sixteen players in multiplayer matches, with game modes including variations of deathmatch and Capture the Flag. Players must actively seek out other players through their Xbox Live Friends list, using the party invite system, or the LAN search feature to play multiplayer matches with their own custom rules and customized maps. If they are connected to Xbox Live however, a player can choose to have the game decide for them the exact rules and map to play on, as well as finding additional people to play against or with, using the &quot;Matchmaking&quot; system (the automated grouping of players of similar skill). A player will decide from a selection of developer designed &quot;playlists&quot; which each contain a certain way to experience the game.

Like other multiplayer Xbox 360 titles, &quot;Halo 3&quot; uses a customized version of TrueSkill ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis. A linear measure of a player&#x27;s experience with the matchmade portion of the game and each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as EXP). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player&#x27;s service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Halo 3&quot; supports downloadable content and updates. The online services for the original Xbox 360 version of the game went offline in January 2022.

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting and characters ===

&quot;Halo 3&quot; is set in a science fiction setting during the years 2552 and 2553. Humanity is at war with a genocidal alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. After years of conflict, a Covenant fleet discovers Earth during &quot;Halo 2&quot;. &quot;Halos&quot; are massive ringworlds, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, scattered across the galaxy. These rings were constructed thousands of years ago by a race known as the Forerunners as weapons of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the Flood. When activated, the Halos would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of its food. The Forerunners disappeared after they activated the rings. In &quot;&quot;, whilst fleeing the Covenant, the UNSC ship &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; stumbled upon one of these ringworlds, Installation 04. Against the wishes of the ring&#x27;s artificial intelligence (AI) caretaker, 343 Guilty Spark, the human supersoldier Master Chief destroyed the ring to stop the threat from Halo and the Flood. The Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, during &quot;Halo 2&quot; in order to fulfill their religious prophecy. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with humanity in order to stop the installation&#x27;s firing. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the Ark. Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.

&quot;Halo 3&quot;″s protagonist is Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, an enhanced supersoldier known as a &quot;Spartan&quot;. Master Chief fights alongside the Arbiter, a disgraced Covenant Elite commander. Two other Elite characters, N&#x27;tho &#x27;Sraom and Usze &#x27;Taham, appear as the third and fourth players in cooperative play. Supporting characters from previous games return, including human soldiers Avery Johnson and Miranda Keyes. Also playing a role in the story is the Flood leader known as the &quot;Gravemind&quot;. In &quot;Halo 2&quot;, the Gravemind escapes from confinement, invades the Covenant mobile capital city of &quot;High Charity&quot;, and captures the human AI Cortana.

=== Plot ===
After the events of the comic tie-in &quot;&quot;, the Master Chief arrives on Earth in east Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief and company return to a UNSC outpost where Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact the Covenant have excavated. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth&#x27;s ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify the Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.

Traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard &quot;High Charity&quot; in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth and defeat the remainder of his army, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations&#x27; activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.

The Chief, Arbiter, and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from &quot;High Charity&quot; and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo&#x27;s control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect &quot;his&quot; ring. Although the Chief destroys Guilty Spark, Johnson soon dies of his injuries. Chief activates the ring, and escapes the ring&#x27;s self-destruction on the UNSC frigate &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot;. However, the force of Halo&#x27;s blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot;, carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth.

A memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet. Meanwhile, the rear half of the &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot; drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. As the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him, but he comforts her by telling her &quot;wake me when you need me.&quot; If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot; drifting towards an unknown planet, setting up the events of &quot;Halo 4&quot;.

== Development ==
&quot;Halo 2&quot; was a critical and commercial success, but its development had taken a toll on Bungie. The game&#x27;s development was fraught and rushed, resulting in the final act of the game&#x27;s campaign being cut. Bungie was openly critical of the game&#x27;s shortcomings, and viewed a third &quot;Halo&quot; game as a chance to do right by fans for &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s problems, as well as the final &quot;Halo&quot; game the studio would make before moving onto other projects. Lingering dissatisfaction with Bungie&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft in 2000 and a desire for more favorable profit-sharing on &quot;Halo 3&quot; led to an agreement where Bungie would become an independent studio after shipping a set number of new &quot;Halo&quot; games.

After &quot;Halo 2&quot; shipped, Bungie cofounder Jason Jones went on sabbatical, leaving the &quot;Halo 3&quot; team with little direction or leadership; different staff members wrestled over who would take on creative positions for the new game, and no clear creative direction was decided upon. Story writer Joseph Staten took a vacation after coming into conflict with other staff members, meaning there was no clear person who was responsible for the game&#x27;s story for a portion of development. The story was drafted by a committee, then presented to senior Bungie members. Composer Martin O&#x27;Donnell recalled he did not feel the draft would work, as it left out previous characters and plot threads. Having recently seen the film &quot;Serenity&quot;, he insisted that characters should die to increase the stakes. Staten returned to do edits after the plot had been established.

&quot;Halo 2&quot; had popularized online multiplayer matchmaking and social features like player parties and voice chat. The Xbox 360 integrated many similar features into Xbox Live, but changed the underlying system. Designer Max Hoberman recalled that instead of creating new features, he spent a year fixing broken features to get back to parity with &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

Compared to the harried pace of &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s development which necessitated painful cuts to ship the game on time, Bungie staffers recalled &quot;Halo 3&quot;″s development as much more smooth, with more time to add features like Forge mode.

Bungie remained quiet as to what their new project was, leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a &quot;new project&quot;. The game was officially announced with a real-time cinematic trailer at E3 2006.

In comparison with &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s tight-lipped development, Bungie was more transparent about the process for &quot;Halo 3&quot;. Bungie kept the public informed on game development via weekly updates on their web site. During development, the game was divided into single player and multiplayer builds; this made debugging and testing the much smaller multiplayer files quicker. While details of &quot;Halo 3&quot;″s multiplayer were widely disseminated in the sixteen months leading up to the release, the single-player aspect of the storyline was kept relatively secret throughout much of the development to build up interest. The first campaign screenshots did not appear until a year after the announcement trailer, on July 5, 2007, as a &quot;tease&quot; for the planned pace of marketing.

A public beta test of the game&#x27;s online multiplayer features, as well as saved films and file share, took place four months before the full release. Players required a &quot;Crackdown&quot; disc to play the beta.

AI behavior was enhanced and improved; the behavior of enemy Brutes the player faces was modified, giving them a &quot;pack mentality&quot; that causes the aliens to perform similar actions at the same time and altering gameplay.

=== Graphics ===
&quot;Halo 3&quot; utilizes a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. It employs graphics technologies such as high dynamic range, global lighting, and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but was added to the final game. Most dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game&#x27;s plant life. &quot;Halo 3&quot; uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to away, all fully three-dimensional. The engine is capable of real-time reflections, but are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources. &quot;Halo 3&quot; uses two frame buffers instead of the usual single buffer, allowing Bungie to preserve as much of dynamic range as possible for the game&#x27;s lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. As a consequence, the game natively renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of 720p. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360. &quot;Halo 3&quot; has also been enhanced for Xbox One X, rendering at 1920p upscaled to 2160p in HDR at a solid 30fps.

=== Audio ===
As with all titles on the Xbox 360, &quot;Halo 3&quot; fully supports 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, there are over 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This is far more than in either of the preceding &quot;Halo&quot; titles; &quot;Halo 2&quot; had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like pre-recorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.

Marty O&#x27;Donnell again composed the original score for the game. Some pieces of the game&#x27;s music are produced with a much larger real orchestra than any pieces in the prior two games. For example, the music for the announcement trailer was recorded with a 60-piece orchestra and a 24-piece choir. &quot;Halo 3&quot; is the first game in the series to feature custom soundtracks, allowing players to replace in-game music with their own choices. The &quot;Halo 3 Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on November 20, 2007. Included on the soundtrack is an original composition submitted by fans and judged by Nile Rodgers, Michael Ostin, and Marty O&#x27;Donnell.

Voice actors returning to reprise their roles in &quot;Halo 3&quot; include Jen Taylor as Cortana, David Scully as Sergeant Johnson and the Elites, Keith David as the Arbiter, Tim Dadabo as 343 Guilty Spark, Ron Perlman as Lord Hood, Robert Davi as Rtas &#x27;Vadum, and Steve Downes as the voice of Master Chief. The game also features new voices, with Terence Stamp and Justis Bolding replacing &quot;Halo 2&quot; voice actors Michael Wincott and Julie Benz as the Prophet of Truth and Miranda Keyes respectively. Additional voices include celebrity presenter Jonathan Ross, Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, Katee Sackhoff, and John DiMaggio. Members of the &quot;Halo&quot; machinima &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; (Burnie Burns, Gus Sorola, Matt Hullum, Jason Saldaña, Geoff Ramsey, and Joel Heyman) have cameo roles.

== Release ==
Microsoft spent more than $40million marketing &quot;Halo 3&quot;. The goal of the campaign was to sell more Xbox 360 consoles and widen the appeal of the game beyond the &quot;&quot;Halo&quot; faithful&quot; to casual as well as hardcore gamers. Marketing took the form of stages, including trailers of the game, real-time cinematics, recorded gameplay sequences, pre-rendered CGI, and live action film. On September 12, 2007, the &quot;Believe&quot; &quot;Halo 3&quot; ad campaign, focused on the epic nature of the story and heroism told through dioramas and third party accounts of Master Chief&#x27;s service, began with the video &quot;Museum&quot; and continued on past the game&#x27;s release.

Throughout the course of development Bungie released four &quot;developer documentaries&quot; that explained the processes behind creating parts of the game. A large-scale multiplayer beta test was played on Xbox Live with more than 800,000 members of the public being able to take part and experience the game for themselves. Beginning in June 2007, an alternate reality game called &quot;Iris&quot; involved players in slowly revealing background information for the game. The actual release was met with worldwide launch parties.

&quot;Halo 3&quot; also had marketing tie-ins and promotions. PepsiCo announced a new line of soft drink, a variant of Mountain Dew named Game Fuel, branded with the &quot;Halo 3&quot; logo and the Master Chief. Much of the advertising focused on appealing to the general public, rather than just hardcore fans of the game; for example, some 7-Eleven stores advertised &quot;Halo 3&quot; and sold specialty cups and copies of the game. Gamestation stores in the UK offered a limited edition Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 preorders.

The game&#x27;s final testing copy before its gold release—codenamed &quot;Epsilon&quot; and confirmed by Bungie to be almost complete—was leaked to the Internet months before the game&#x27;s release date. Microsoft reacted to this leak by having the Xbox Live accounts of gamers caught playing the leaked copy banned until the year 9999. Retail copies of the game, complete with photographs of the open game box, started to appear on the internet auction site eBay weeks before release, followed by UK catalog retailer Argos accidentally releasing some of their copies a week early. Microsoft&#x27;s Entertainment and Devices division were quoted as being &quot;disappointed&quot; that the Argos leak happened, but stated they had no intention for punishing them for an &quot;honest mistake&quot;. The retail copy was also leaked online over a week before release, with the 6.14 gigabyte file of the game ripped from a disc and downloaded by thousands of people within 24 hours. Videos of the ending of &quot;Halo 3&quot;, obtained from the leaked copy, were captured and posted on video sharing sites.

&quot;Halo 3&quot; was released on September 25, 2007, in three separate retail versions: &quot;Standard&quot;, &quot;Limited&quot;, and &quot;Legendary&quot;. The Standard Edition contains the game disc, manual, and a small poster with the game&#x27;s control-map and artwork. The Limited Edition, contained in a metal case, contains the game disc, manual, poster, Xbox 360 bonus disc with featurettes, and a hardcover-bound &quot;Bestiarum&quot;, a collection of information and art covering the species, cultures, and civilizations of &quot;Halo 3&quot;. The Legendary Edition contains the game disc, manual, poster, interactive bonus disc, the Bestiarum on a DVD, Legendary DVD containing exclusive content, and a scale replica of the Master Chief&#x27;s helmet as a case for the three discs. The slip-cover packaging unfolds into a large heavy-stock poster of Master Chief. Some of the Limited Edition versions of &quot;Halo 3&quot; were found to have a defect in the hub that kept the discs in place, which could lead to scratched discs. Microsoft introduced a disc replacement program in response.

On the day before its official release, 4.2 million units of &quot;Halo 3&quot; were in retail outlets.

&quot;Halo 3&quot; was made a free download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers through the &quot;Games with Gold&quot; program in October 2013. It became playable on the Xbox One via backwards compatibility in 2017. An Xbox One-native version of the game, presenting the graphics at 1080p and 60 frames per second, was included as part of &quot;&quot; for the Xbox One in 2014. &quot;Halo 3&quot; was re-released again as part of the Windows version of &quot;The Master Chief Collection&quot; in 2020.

==Downloadable content==
&quot;Halo 3&quot; supports multiplayer map downloadable content as well as game updates via Xbox Live. The first three post-release multiplayer maps, &quot;Standoff&quot;, &quot;Rat&#x27;s Nest&quot;, and &quot;Foundry&quot;, were released as a pack on December 11, 2007, collectively known as the &quot;Heroic Map Pack&quot;. A second group of three maps including a remake of &quot;Halo 2&quot; map &quot;Lockout&quot;, titled &quot;Blackout&quot;, a new map &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and a remake of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; map &quot;Sidewinder&quot;, titled &quot;Avalanche&quot; were bundled as the &quot;Legendary Map Pack&quot;, on April 15, 2008. These maps introduced visual filters to the Forge pallet, which change the way the maps look. A remake of the &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; map &quot;Chill Out&quot;, titled &quot;Cold Storage&quot;, was released as a free download on &quot;Bungie Day&quot;, July 7, 2008. The third multiplayer map pack, titled the &quot;Mythic Map Pack&quot; and consisting of the maps &quot;Orbital&quot;, &quot;Assembly&quot;, and &quot;Sandbox&quot;, was included with the Limited Collectors Edition of &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. The map pack was released over the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 9, 2009. The fourth and final multiplayer map pack, &quot;Mythic II Map Pack&quot;, was released on February 2, 2010. The map pack includes the three new maps from &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;: &quot;Citadel&quot;, &quot;Longshore&quot;, and a remake of &quot;Halo 2&quot; map &quot;Midship&quot;, titled &quot;Heretic&quot;.

The first version update for &quot;Halo 3&quot; was released on February 19, 2008, and addressed various bugs such as melee contest resolution and saved-film theater errors. The next update (called a Title Update) was released September 23, 2008, and includes new Achievements, a new XP ranking system, and various new ways to detect and stop cheating in the game. No further &quot;Halo 3&quot; updates were planned.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===

First-day sales of &quot;Halo 3&quot; reached $170million in the U.S., setting a record for highest gross of a video game within 24 hours of its release. The performance beat the previous record setter—&quot;Halo 2&quot;—which earned $125million within 24 hours of its launch. The game was preordered by more than one million people in North America. Worldwide more than US$300million worth were sold in the first week, helping to more than double the sales of the Xbox 360 when compared with the weekly average before the &quot;Halo 3&quot; launch. By 2010, Microsoft reported total grosses at $600 million.

In the U.S., &quot;Halo 3&quot; sold 3.3 million copies in its first 12 days on sale, increasing to 3.7 million copies by November 15, 2007. &quot;Reuters UK&quot; estimated that &quot;Halo 3&quot; may have sold up to 5.2 million copies worldwide in the first two weeks after launch. By November 30, 2007, &quot;Halo 3&quot; had sold 5million copies worldwide, and as of that point, was the best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S., even though the game is only available on one console. On January 3, 2008, Microsoft announced that &quot;Halo 3&quot; had sold copies. The game drew over a million Xbox Live members to play online in the first 20 hours, making it the biggest day for Xbox Live gaming in history. The game returned to the top 20 sales charts more than a year after its release in February 2009; &quot;Gamasutra&quot; reported that the boost might have been due to the release of &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. According to Microsoft, &quot;Halo 3&quot; had sold 14.5 million copies . In the U.S., the game was the best-selling video game of 2007 and the fourteenth best-selling game of the 2000s decade.

&quot;Advertising Age&quot; reported that movie studio executives were convinced the release of &quot;Halo 3&quot; harmed box office receipts; the week&#x27;s take was 27% less than the previous year&#x27;s yield. While some executives decided the disparity in estimated and actual gross for films like &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; was due more to the film&#x27;s poor reception, other analysts believed that &quot;the audience on [&quot;Halo 3&quot;] is the 18-to-34 demographic, similar to what you&#x27;d see in cinemas&quot; and that this led to a decrease in receipts. Later research suggested that the &quot;Halo 3&quot; players still watched the same amount of television and movies, regardless of the time they spent playing the game.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Halo 3&quot; received critical acclaim upon its release. It holds an average of 94/100 on aggregate website Metacritic. &quot;Pro-G&quot;″s Wesley Yin-Poole assured readers that &quot;Halo 3&quot; lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it, writing that the game was &quot;everything we hoped it would be, and much, much, more&quot;. Reviewers including &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Rob Fahey, &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s Charlie Barrett, and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann felt that the underlying formula of previous &quot;Halo&quot; games was unchanged, but that this was not a detriment. &quot;Every type of Halo fan, from the hardcore to the casual to the brand new, will find something to satisfy them in Master Chief&#x27;s third adventure,&quot; Barrett asserted, while &quot;IGN&quot;″s Hilary Goldstein referred to &quot;Halo 3&quot; as &quot;the most complete game available on any console&quot;, specifically stating &quot;the Forge and the replay functionality raise the bar for console shooters so high, it may never be surpassed this generation.&quot; The gameplay additions to the game, such as equipment and new vehicles, were praised; Gerstmann and Goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than the campaign.

Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole wrote that while the cliffhanger ending of &quot;Halo 2&quot; was disappointing, the campaign of &quot;Halo 3&quot; was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was highly critical of the eighth level, stating &quot;the penultimate chapter is so bad, just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Charles Herold said the game had a &quot;throwaway&quot; plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game&#x27;s story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

Most publications agreed that multiplayer was by far one of the best features; &quot;IGN&quot; said that the multiplayer map lineup was the strongest of the series, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; added that &quot;each [multiplayer] map is extremely well-tuned&quot;. The Forge level editor and saved films features were singled out as particularly strong features, in addition to superb voice acting and Martin O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s rich score.

Other complaints focused on the artificial intelligence; critics praised the enemy AI but complained that the intelligence of the player&#x27;s allies was far poorer. Bryan Vore of &quot;Game Informer&quot; said that human faces and some textures were just &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

&quot;Halo 3&quot; was nominated for seven awards from the Spike TV Awards, of which it won &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; and &quot;Most Addictive Video Game Fueled by Dew&quot;. It won &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot; chose it as the Best Xbox 360 Online Multiplayer Game and Innovative Design of 2007. The Visual Effects Society awarded Bungie the &quot;Best Real Time Visuals in a Video Game&quot; for &quot;Halo 3&quot;. &quot;Halo 3&quot; took the &quot;Calvin Award&quot; for &quot;Best Videogame&quot; as selected by Box Office Prophets. &quot;Halo 3&quot; also took the award for Xbox 360 Game of the Year 2007 from &quot;GameTrailers&quot;, and was voted by fans as Game of the Year on G-Phoria. &quot;Halo 3&quot; won the &quot;Edge&quot; Award For Interactive Innovation in August 2008. During the 11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Halo 3&quot; for &quot;Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay&quot;. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Jac Holzman (born September 15, 1931) is an American record executive. He is the founder of the record labels Elektra Records and Nonesuch Records. Holzman helped commercially launch the CD and home video formats, as well as the pilot program which became MTV. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

== Early life ==
Holzman was born to a Jewish family, the son of a Manhattan doctor. He founded Elektra Entertainment as a small independent folk label in his St. John&#x27;s College dormitory room in 1950, with $600 ($ in dollars). That same year, the first record released was &quot;New Songs&quot; by John Gruen, initially a flop but a big learning lesson; 500 copies were pressed with fewer than a quarter of them sold. He held amateur radio callsign K2VEH around this time. In 1968, he approved Elektra Records&#x27; Paxton Lodge, the experimental recording studio where Jackson Browne first recorded. By 1957, Elektra was $90,000 in debt ($ in dollars), but finally found success with folk artist Theodore Bikel.

==Career==
He signed such acts as the Doors, Queen (US only), Love, Josh White, Tim Buckley, Carly Simon, the Stooges, MC5, Harry Chapin, and Bread to Elektra and discovered folk singer Judy Collins. In 1964, Holzman served as executive producer for 13 stock sound effect libraries titled &quot;Authentic Sound Effects&quot; which generated $1.5 million ($ in dollars) in sales giving Elektra further financial security; that same year he also founded Nonesuch Records as a classical music budget label.
In 1970, he merged his music interests with Warner Communications (then known as Kinney International) over a $10 million deal ($ in dollars) and continued his association with the labels he created for three additional years. While a part of the Warner Music Group, Holzman helped to establish both the WEA Distributing Corp (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Distributing Corp) and WEA International.

In 1973, Holzman was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for WCI. Holzman guided the company into home video and the first interactive cable television system, QUBE. Until 1972, he was a director of Pioneer Electronics Japan, helping that company, and Warner Bros., adopt the compact disc and Laserdisc. Holzman was a member of the board of Atari, one of the first video game companies, which was acquired by WCI in 1976; during this time the revolutionary Atari 2600 was released.

In 1979, Holzman became the nexus between ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith and John Lack of Warner Cable. He persuaded Lack to meet with Nesmith who had been nursing an idea for a program he called &quot;PopClips&quot;. Holzman thought that Nesmith&#x27;s notion of building a TV structure around that idea made real sense.

In 1982, following the death of president and founder Robert Gottschalk, Holzman took charge of Panavision, a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery and turned that financially troubled company around.

In 1986, he formed FirstMedia, an investment firm which acquired Cinema Products Corporation, the maker of the Oscar-winning Steadicam camera stabilization system.

In 1991, through FirstMedia, Holzman acquired the Discovery, Trend and Musicraft jazz labels from the estate of Albert Marx, which was also acquired by Warner Music Group in 1993.

After Edgar Bronfman Jr. and a group of investors acquired Warner Music Group from Time Warner Inc. in 2004, Bronfman brought Holzman back to WMG, reuniting him with the company that he had helped to found with Ahmet Ertegun and Mo Ostin. Although Holzman&#x27;s work at Warner Music covers a range from mentoring executives and future planning, his first project was the creation of an on-line label, Cordless Recordings, introduced in late 2005. Cordless gave bands space to hone their art and grow without the expectations and cash outlays associated with a major label.

===Current===
In April 2016, Steve Cooper, CEO of Warner Music Group, announced Jac Holzman as the Senior Technology Advisor to WMG: &quot;a wide-ranging technology &#x27;scout&#x27;, exploring new digital developments and identifying possible partners.&quot;

In June 2018, Holzman launched a new venture named &quot;Cosmic Ringtones &amp; Sonic Realms... Your Universe Is Calling&quot;. Curated and produced by Holzman, the collection included a series of instrumental pieces composed, performed, and recorded by his son Adam. The album was released on Holzman&#x27;s FM Group Music label, distributed by ADA.

==Awards and honours==
In 2008, Holzman received the NARAS Grammy Trustees Award.

On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Holzman would be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with Specialty Records founder Art Rupe) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Holzman was inducted into the non-performer category of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 14, 2011, with the induction speech given by Doors member John Densmore.

==Personal life==
Holzman is the father of Adam Holzman, a jazz-rock keyboardist who has played with Miles Davis; Jaclyn Easton, a writer and Internet entrepreneur; and Marin Sander-Holzman, an editor and filmmaker.

In 1973 he built a home in Hawaii, after Elektra merged with Warner. The move was inspired by the film &quot;Holiday&quot;, where at that time he was mostly reading instead of listening to music.

<doc id="1181493" wikidata="Q1462548" url="?curid=1181493" title="L'homme armé">
<text>&quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; () is a secular song from the Late Middle Ages, of the Burgundian School. According to Allan W. Atlas, &quot;the tune circulated in both the Mixolydian mode and Dorian mode (transposed to G).&quot; It was the most popular tune used for musical settings of the Ordinary of the Mass: over 40 separate compositions entitled &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé&quot; survive from the period.

==Music==

==Lyrics==
==Origin==

The origins of the popularity of the song and the importance of the armed man are the subject of various theories. Some have suggested that the &#x27;armed man&#x27; represents St Michael the Archangel. The composer Johannes Regis ( – ) seems to have intended that allusion in his &quot;Dum sacrum mysterium/Missa l&#x27;homme armé&quot; based upon the melody, which incorporates various additional trope texts and cantus firmus plainchants in honour of St Michael the Archangel. Others have suggested it merely represents the name of a popular tavern (Maison L&#x27;Homme Arme) near Du Fay&#x27;s rooms in Cambrai. It may also represent the arming for a new crusade against the Turks. There is ample evidence to indicate that it held special significance for the Order of the Golden Fleece. It is useful to note that the first appearance of the song was exactly contemporaneous with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks (1453), an event which had a huge psychological effect in Europe; composers such as Guillaume Du Fay composed laments for the occasion. Yet another possibility is that all three theories are true, given the feeling of urgency, pervasive in central and northern Europe at the time, in organizing a military opposition to the recently victorious Ottomans.

Another recently proposed theory for the origin of the tune is that it is a stylised combination of a street cry and a trumpet call, and may have originated as early as the late 14th century, or perhaps early 15th, due to its use of the major prolation, which was the most common metre at the time. Richard Taruskin noted that the tune was a special favourite of Charles the Bold and suggested that it may have been composed for him (or, at very least, that he had identified himself with the titular man at arms). This however has been refuted by researchers who show it was used before Charles the Bold&#x27;s ascension as Duke of Burgundy.

==Use in the Latin Mass==

&quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; is especially well remembered today because it was so widely used by Renaissance composers as a cantus firmus for the Latin Mass. It was probably used for this purpose more than any other secular song: over 40 settings are known. Many composers of the Renaissance set at least one mass on this melody; the two settings by Josquin, the &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé super voces musicales&quot;, and the &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé sexti toni&quot; are among the best known. Other composers who wrote more than one setting include Matthaeus Pipelare, Pierre de la Rue, Cristóbal de Morales, Guillaume Du Fay and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (two settings). A cycle of six settings, all anonymous but probably by the same composer, survives in a Neapolitan manuscript which was supposedly a gift to Beatrice of Aragon of some of the favorite music of Charles the Bold.
While the practice of writing masses on the tune lasted into the seventeenth century, including a late setting by Carissimi, the majority of mass settings of &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot;, approximately 30, are from the period between 1450 and 1510.

One of the earliest datable uses of the melody itself was in the combinative chanson &quot;Il sera pour vous conbatu/L&#x27;homme armé&quot; ascribed to Robert Morton, which now is believed probably to date from around 1463, owing to historical references in the text. Another possibly earlier version of the tune is an anonymous three-voice setting from the Mellon Chansonnier, which also cannot be precisely dated. In 1523 Pietro Aron, in his treatise &quot;Thoscanello&quot; suggested that Antoine Busnois was the composer of the tune; while tantalizing, since the tune is stylistically consistent with Busnois, there is no other source to corroborate Aron, and he was writing approximately 70 years after the first appearance of the melody. Taruskin has argued that Busnois wrote the earliest known mass on the melody, but this is disputed, many scholars preferring to see the older Guillaume Du Fay as the creator of the first &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; Mass. Other composers whose settings of the tune may date from the 1450s include Guillaume Faugues, Johannes Regis, and Johannes Ockeghem.

The tune is singularly well-adapted to contrapuntal treatment. The phrases are clearly delineated, and there are several obvious ways to construct canons. It is also unusually easy to recognize within a contrapuntal texture.

==Modern treatments==

Composers still occasionally turn to this song for spiritual or thematic inspiration.
*British composer Peter Maxwell Davies: parody mass &quot;Missa super l&#x27;homme armé&quot; (1968, revised 1971).
* Welsh composer Karl Jenkins drew heavily on &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; for his 1999 mass, &quot;The Armed Man - A Mass for Peace&quot;, composed for SATB chorus, soloists and symphonic orchestra and dedicated to the victims of the 1998-1999 Kosovo War. 
* Throughout his work, &quot;Seven Last Words of the Unarmed&quot;, Joel Thompson uses &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; as a thematic motif.

<doc id="1181494" wikidata="Q5331186" url="?curid=1181494" title="Easy rider (slang)">
<text>Easy rider is an archaic United States slang expression whose meaning has varied with time.

==History==
===Origins===
Easy rider originally meant an expert horseman or a horse that was easy to ride.

===1900s===
In the early 1900s the term took on the meaning of &quot;freeloader&quot; as found in the old song &quot;We Don&#x27;t Care What Mr. Crump Don&#x27;t Allow&quot;, based on &quot;We Don&#x27;t Care What Mama Don&#x27;t Allow&quot;:
:Mr. Crump won&#x27;t &#x27;low no easy riders here,
:Mr. Crump won&#x27;t &#x27;low no easy riders here,
:We don&#x27;t care what Mr. Crump don&#x27;t &#x27;low,
:We goin&#x27; to bar&#x27;l-house anyhow—
:Mr. Crump can go and catch hisself some air!

&quot;Easy rider&quot; in blues came to denote a lover, male or female. If it refers to a man, it usually implies he is unscrupulous, is a prostitute&#x27;s lover and lives off her earnings. It can also mean a male lover whose movements are easy and satisfying. 

To the easily titillated, the term referred to a woman who had liberal sexual views, had been married more than once, or someone skilled at sex. The term appears in numerous blues lyrics of the 1920s and many popular early folk-blues tunes such as &quot;See See Rider&quot;, first recorded by Ma Rainey in 1924, and later recorded by Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins when with Aladdin Records. Early uses of the term include the 1925 jazz recording by Johnny Bayersdorffer&#x27;s Jazzola Novelty Orchestra entitled &quot;I Wonder Where My Easy Rider&#x27;s Riding Now&quot; (later covered by Mae West) and &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Allow No Easy Riders Here&quot; in 1929 by Tampa Red. 

===Great Depression===
During the Great Depression a large population of Americans driven by poverty rode the railroad system and the term easy rider (along with hobo and bum) found its way into slang vocabulary to mean a slow moving train and the men that, even after the great depression, continued to live and travel along the rails. The majority of these trains, commissioned in the early 1920s, had the letters C.C. (for Colorado Central) or S.C. (for Southern Coastal) stenciled on them in bold white letters. This is most likely where the term C.C. rider originated.

===World War II===
In the World War II era the slang term re-emerged with a modified meaning, where G.I.s on extended deployment in Asia or Europe (unofficially) employed children to perform the daily mundane tasks so common in the military like tending to barracks, shining boots, and the like, so a G.I. who employed a houseboy coasted through this work and had an &quot;easy ride&quot;.

Eventually young native women were hired to tend to individual living quarters and soon became lovers as well as maids.

When these men left and other G.I.s took their place, the women, accustomed to the workload, would remain to perform the same services, sometimes preparing gear or a living area for inspection better than the soldier could.

===1960s===

The term had a different meaning in the &quot;free love&quot; cultural era of the 1960s and was first applied to women who practiced free love. A man who lived with this type of woman had a free or easy ride, since the woman still did most of the chores even though Second-wave feminism began to have a major influence on women at this time.

The term soon acquired a negative connotation however as it became a derogatory way to describe a woman with whom a hippie could live, then leave abruptly and who would not get angry if he came back later. Soon it was applied to prostitutes whom it was easy to fool or steal from or who simply traded their charms for a small amount of food or drugs.

==Effects on entertainment==
The term appears in the famous &quot;See See Rider Blues&quot; song recorded by Ma Rainey in 1925. The song and others like it used the loneliness of a rider of the rails or wanderer as a theme in their music.

The 1969 movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was in 1967 initially conceived as &quot;The Loners&quot; with Hopper directing, Fonda producing, and both starring and writing. They brought in Texan screenwriter Terry Southern, who came up with the new title, even though others claim credit, too. The film had wandering motorcycle riders as its characters, and due to the notoriety of the movie the term again acquired another meaning to fit into the cultural mores of the time, to mean Harley-Davidson chopper motorcycles and their riders.

Dennis Hopper, the director of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, said in its making-of documentary Shaking the Cage:
&quot;An easy rider is a person that is not a pimp, but he lives off a woman; he lives off a whore. He&#x27;s her easy rider. He&#x27;s the one that she loves and she gives money to. He doesn&#x27;t pimp her, but he&#x27;s her easy rider.&quot;

Led Zeppelin, although a rock band, was heavily influenced by early jazz and blues and make reference in numerous songs to an &quot;easy rider.&quot; Most notably the song &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; makes reference to this free love practice and the cultural impact of it as he is both proud and ashamed to be seen with a woman known to be an &quot;easy rider&quot; while at the same time trying to hitchhike a ride.

After his music was used in the motion picture soundtrack of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, Jimi Hendrix was inspired to write the song &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot;, on his album &quot;The Cry of Love&quot; originally released in 1971. Already in 1970, &quot;Easy Rider (Let the Wind Pay the Way)&quot; from the album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was Iron Butterfly&#x27;s second biggest hit.

<text>Thomas Ellis Owen (1805–1862) was an English architect and developer responsible for many of the buildings that still exist in Southsea and Gosport. He designed many churches in Hampshire and some of his work that still stands today can be found in Shropshire, Dorset and Pembrokeshire.

==Biography==
===Early life and training===
Owen was born in Middlesex, the son of Mary and Jacob Owen, an architect for the Royal Engineers Ordnance Department in Portsmouth. He trained as an architect and, although his architecture was probably influenced by John Nash, Owen had a lighter touch that belonged more to his Georgian roots than the Victorian times he mainly practiced in. On completing his articles, Owen travelled through Italy studying its architectural history and development. Returning to England, Thomas married Catherine, the daughter of one of his father&#x27;s colleagues J.W Higgins, surveyor of Government Works.

===Early career===
In the 1820s he entered into a private practice with his father, Messrs Jacob Owen and Son. Many of the ecclesiastical and civic works undertaken by the father and son is hard to clearly attribute to either one during this period, although it seems likely that there was a high degree of collaboration between them in buildings such as All Saint&#x27;s Church, Portsea (1825-1828), Holy Trinity Church, Gosport (1828-30) and St John the Baptist, Rowlands Castle (1837). In the 1830s Owen, along with his father and father-in-law, began developing the land around Southsea as a business venture.

===Development of Southsea===
Owen was instrumental in shaping the development of Southsea during the middle part of the 19th century, developing it from poorly drained farmland into a garden suburb. He designed and built 106 villas and 54 terrace houses in Southsea, including Queens Terrace, Beach Road, Portland Terrace, and Eastern Parade. In addition, he designed a range of commercial, religious, and civic buildings, including St Jude&#x27;s Church in central Southsea.

Owen&#x27;s early developments began as an extension of the Dockyard Garrison, but soon drew the attention of the nobility and gentry of Portsea Island, who were attracted to the fashionable terraces which included Kings Terrace and Bellevue Terrace. In the early 1830s, Owen completed developments in the Grove Road and surrounding area, later extending towards the Kent Road area with Swiss Cottage (1837) and Queens Terrace (1837-40). Further works followed. Owen&#x27;s works include Kent Road (Kent Lodge), Grove Road South (The Shrubbery), The Thicket (1844/6), Portland Terrace (1846), Queens Place (1847), Dovercourt (1848). In the 1850s he completed St Jude&#x27;s Church (1851), Sussex Terrace (1854/5) and 30-34 Sussex Road (1857). Along with his father, Jacob Owen, and his brother Jeremiah Owen, he lent his entrepreneurial hand to infrastructural projects in the areas including gas supply, the Portsea Canal, railways, the Camber Docks and hospitals.

===Politics and Portsmouth mayoralty===
In addition to his work as an architect and developer, Owen was a prominent civic figure.Owen&#x27;s politics, like that of his brother-in-law Sir Charles Lanyon were instinctively conservative. Historian Norman Gordon has noted that Owen&#x27;s rise in Portsmouth politics was meteoric in comparison to other civic leaders in Portsmouth. Despite this, his first attempts to enter politics were unsuccessful. In 1835, Owen entered his name for election of the new Borough Council, perceiving a political biased because only Reform or Whig supporters were chosen. At the election the entire nine candidates of the &#x27;Reform&#x27; group were elected. Owen came eleventh with 95 votes. Following the Alderman elections of 31 December 1835 a vacancy opened in St Thomas&#x27; Ward. Owen found himself facing off against Benjamin Bramble but lost by 177 votes to 111.

Despite these losses, Owen remained a keen political commentator in Portsmouth politics through his development work. He became Mayor of Portsmouth twice (in 1847 and 1862) and also served as a magistrate. 

===Memorials===

In 2010 a statue of Owen was unveiled, located near the University Library, Cambridge Road, Portsmouth. An English Heritage Blue Plaque was placed at Dovercourt, 36 Kent Road, Southsea, Owen&#x27;s former home, inscribed with &#x27;Thomas Ellis Owen, 1805–1862, Architect and Developer of Southsea lived here from 1849&#x27;.

<text>Shivkumar Sharma (13 January 1938 – 10 May 2022) was an Indian classical musician and santoor player who is credited with adapting the santoor for Indian classical music. As a music composer, he collaborated with Indian flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia under the collaborative name Shiv–Hari and composed music for such hit Indian films as &quot;Faasle&quot; (1985), &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), and &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991).

Sharma was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1986 and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan (India&#x27;s fourth and second highest civilian awards) in 1991 and 2001.

==Early life==
Sharma was born to a Dogra family on 13 January 1938, in Jammu in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in British India. His father Uma Dutt Sharma was a vocalist and a tabla player. His father started teaching him vocals and tabla, when he was just five. His father saw an opportunity to introduce him to the santoor, a hammered dulcimer, which was a folk instrument that traced its origins to ancient Persia, but was played in Kashmir. He saw the styles that integrated Sufi notes with traditional Kashmiri folk music and had his son play the instrument that was then new to Indian classical music. Sharma started learning santoor at the age of thirteen and gave his first public performance in Mumbai in 1955. The one-hour-long rendition of Raga Yaman at his first live performance in 1955, left his audience in Mumbai shouting ‘Encore!’ 

==Career==
Starting his career playing the santoor with his father, Sharma is credited with introducing the santoor as a popular Indian classical music instrument. He recorded his first solo album in 1960. Sharma took the santoor as an Indian classical musical instrument playing at various music venues. He collaborated with Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain and with flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia on many of his performances as well as on his albums. In 1967, he teamed up with Chaurasia and guitarist Brij Bhushan Kabra to produce a concept album, &quot;Call of the Valley&quot; (1967), which turned out to be one of Indian classical music&#x27;s greatest hits.

Sharma composed the background music for one of the scenes in V. Shantaram&#x27;s film &quot;Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje&quot; (1955) where Gopi Krishna performed a Kathak dance piece. Further, he composed music for many Hindi films in collaboration with Chaurasia, starting with &quot;Silsila&quot; (1981). They came to be known as the Shiv–Hari music duo. Some of the movies they composed music for were musical hits, such as &quot;Faasle&quot; (1985), &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991), and &quot;Darr&quot; (1993). Sharma also played tabla including in the popular song &quot;Mo Se Chhal Kiye Jaaye&quot; sung by Lata Mangeshkar in the 1965 film &quot;Guide&quot;, on the insistence of music director S. D. Burman. However, Sharma&#x27;s focus remained on classic music rather than film songs; he said, &quot;Classical music is not for entertainment. It is to take you on a meditative journey, &quot;ye toh mehsoos karne ki cheez hai&quot; (This has to be experienced).&quot; Sharma’s 1968 concert in Los Angeles was his first performance abroad. He followed this with a tour of England in 1970. In 1996, Sharma and his son Rahul played the santoor on a stage in Norway, as &#x27;equals&#x27; for the first time. 

Sharma was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akadeemi Award in 1986, the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award in 1991, and the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian award in 2001.

== Personal life ==
Sharma married Manorama and had two sons, Rohit, who learned Sitar and is currently an executive with Sony India and Rahul, who started learning at the age of 13 to become a santoor player, and they performed together since 1996. In a 1999 interview, Sharma stated that he chose Rahul as his &quot;shishya&quot;, because he thought he had the &quot;gift of God&quot;. He became a staunch devotee and follower of Sathya Sai Baba after starting off as a sceptic.

Sharma died on 10 May 2022 from a cardiac arrest. He was 84 years old. He had kidney failure for the last few months and went through regular dialysis. He received a state funeral at Pawan Hans Juhu aerodrome, Mumbai, on 11 May 2022.

<doc id="1181505" wikidata="Q1752956" url="?curid=1181505" title="Fade to Black (Metallica song)">
<text>&quot;Fade to Black&quot; is a song and the first power ballad by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released as the first promotional single from their second studio album, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (1984). The song was ranked as having the 24th-best guitar solo ever by &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers.

The song peaked at number 100 on Swiss Singles Chart in 2008. The song is certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. In March 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Fade to Black&quot; at number 35 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list.

== Background ==
In an interview on the set of the production &quot;MTV Icon: Metallica&quot; in 2003, drummer Lars Ulrich recalls how he and vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield were &quot;obsessed with death&quot; at the time the album and song were produced. Hetfield later admitted that a break-in to their gear truck resulting in the loss of his favorite Marshall amplifier also contributed to the mood of the song.

The song&#x27;s lyrics address suicidal feelings. It begins with an acoustic guitar introduction and becomes progressively heavier as the song goes on, similar to their future songs, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;The Day That Never Comes&quot;. James Hetfield commented on the song in a 1991 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;:

A review by Gina Boldman described &quot;Fade to Black&quot; as &quot;one of the few Metallica tracks to get radio airplay in the mid- to late &#x27;80s.&quot;

Since its release, &quot;Fade to Black&quot; has been a fixture in Metallica&#x27;s live performances. It was also the last song that Metallica performed live with former bassist Jason Newsted before he left the band, which occurred at the VH1 Music Awards on November 30, 2000. It was one of his favorite Metallica songs, and was said to be of great sentimental value to him, although it had been written before he had joined the band. His previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, performed a song called &quot;Fade to Black&quot; on their 1986 album &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot; before he left to join Metallica.

While on the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour on August 8, 1992, Hetfield accidentally stepped into the path of one of the chemical flames that had been rigged to shoot from the lip of the stage while playing &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. Hetfield&#x27;s 12/6 double-neck horizon guitar protected him from the full force of the blast; however, the fire engulfed most of his left side, burning his hand, both arms, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second- and third-degree burns, but he was back on stage 17 days later, although his guitar duties were delegated to former guitar tech and Metal Church guitarist John Marshall for four weeks while he made a full recovery.

&quot;Fade to Black&quot; was the last song to be played on the Los Angeles heavy metal radio station KNAC, which went off the air on February 15, 1995. It would later sign off fellow longtime rock stations 94 WYSP in Philadelphia on September 2, 2011, and Power 97 in Winnipeg on January 29, 2015.

<text>The Val Trompia (also: &quot;Valle Trompia&quot;) is a slightly more than 50 km long valley in the Province of Brescia, northern Italy. It consists of the valleys of the river Mella and its tributaries, north of the city of Brescia. It is situated between Val Camonica, Val Sabbia and Lake Iseo.

The name originates from the ancient Rhaetian people, the Trumpilini, the conquest of which by part of the Romans was more difficult than that of Cenomani of Brixia. Trumpilini people was listed as first in the Trophy of Augustus, a Roman monument erected between 25-14 BC near La Turbie in honor of Emperor Augustus, who subdued the Alpine tribes.

The presence in the high part of the valley of mineral veins promoted since the antiquity an important mining activity. This encouraged the development of a remarkable iron manufacturing even for the production of weapons. For this reason, under the Venetian domination, the valley was given a special autonomy and a lighter tax regime.

The Val Trompia is known for its suburban sprawl starting north of Brescia. Suburban sprawl continues for more than 20 kilometers northwards although the area is not densely populated.

==Local councils==
The valley includes the &quot;comuni&quot; of:
* Bovegno
* Concesio
* Collebeato
* Gardone Val Trompia
* Lodrino
* Marcheno
* Marmentino 
* Sarezzo 
* Tavernole sul Mella 
* Villa Carcina

<text>AOLpress is a discontinued HTML editor that was available from America Online (AOL). It was originally developed as NaviPress by the company NaviSoft before being bought by AOL. It was discontinued in 2000. However, the last version (2.0) may still be found on some Web sites for downloading.

AOLpress was rather strict about enforcing legal HTML: when saving edited pages that were created outside AOLpress, code that did not conform to the HTML 3.2 standard and specifications may have been changed to do so. Today, the HTML code used is very outdated and may not work correctly in modern browsers. Several features common in current browsers, such as png images, are not supported.

==History==
In February 1994, NaviSoft Inc. released NaviPress, which was a Web browser with an integrated HTML editor. NaviPress was very similar to the first Web browser, WorldWideWeb, created by Tim Berners-Lee, for the classic Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. According to Berners-Lee, &quot;NaviPress was a true browser and editor, which produced clean HTML.&quot;

In late 1995, AOL acquired NaviSoft, and the package was renamed &quot;GNNPress&quot;, then later &quot;AOLpress&quot;, and made available for downloading on AOL&#x27;s Global Network Navigator site. AOL then allowed each username to publish up to 2 megs on the web.

In &quot;Weaving the Web&quot;, Berners-Lee attributes the death of AOLpress to the release of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1996. AOL&#x27;s Steve Case reached an agreement with Bill Gates so that AOL users could use a version of the Internet Explorer browser, which did not have HTML editing functionality. This agreement led to the decline of AOLpress. According to Berners-Lee, AOLpress was, at the time, &quot;one of the few commercial browsers that provided simple online editing.&quot;

In 1998, AOLpress made &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Best Products of the Year&quot; issue. The editors describe it as &quot;the only program that combines WYSIWYG Web page editing, HTML source code editing, Web site management, and Web browsing in a single interface.&quot; The article goes on to say that AOLpress &quot;isn&#x27;t simply an editor that looks like a browser. It &quot;is&quot; a browser.&quot;

==System requirements==
AOLpress 2.0 requires 8 megabytes of RAM, with more recommended, a display capable of at least 256 colors, an Intel 80386 CPU, 8 megabytes of free disk space, and either Windows NT or Windows 95 operating system.

While the installer is 16-bit and will not work under 64-bit Windows to install the software, AOLpress is capable of launching even under Windows 8, though it generally crashes within a short time after starting. Although the program is not accepted by Windows 7, it will run in compatibility mode in Windows 10.

<text>The Illyrian Wars were a series of wars fought between the Roman Republic and the Illyrian kingdom under the Ardiaei and Labeatae. In the &quot;First Illyrian War&quot;, which lasted from 229 BC to 228 BC, Rome&#x27;s concern was that the trade across the Adriatic Sea increased after the First Punic War at a time when Ardiaei power increased under queen Teuta. Attacks on trading vessels of Rome&#x27;s Italic allies by Illyrian pirates and the death of a Roman envoy named Coruncanius on Teuta&#x27;s orders, prompted the Roman senate to dispatch a Roman army under the command of the consuls Lucius Postumius Albinus and Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus. Rome expelled Illyrian garrisons from a number of Greek cities including Epidamnus, Apollonia, Corcyra, Pharos and established a protectorate over these Greek towns. The Romans also set up Demetrius of Pharos as a power in Illyria to counterbalance the power of Teuta.

The &quot;Second Illyrian War&quot; lasted from 220 BC to 219 BC. In 219 BC, the Roman Republic was at war with the Celts of Cisalpine Gaul, and the Second Punic War with Carthage was beginning. These distractions gave Demetrius the time he needed to build a new Illyrian war fleet. Leading this fleet of 90 ships, Demetrius sailed south of Lissus, violating his earlier treaty and starting the war. Demetrius&#x27; fleet first attacked Pylos, where he captured 50 ships after several attempts. From Pylos, the fleet sailed to the Cyclades, quelling any resistance that they found on the way. Demetrius foolishly sent a fleet across the Adriatic, and, with the Illyrian forces divided, the fortified city of Dimale was captured by the Roman fleet under Lucius Aemilius Paulus. From Dimale the navy went towards Pharos. The forces of Rome routed the Illyrians and Demetrius fled to Macedon, where he became a trusted councillor at the court of Philip V of Macedon, and remained there until his death at Messene in 214 BC.

In 171 BC, the Illyrian king Gentius of the Labeatae was allied with the Romans against the Macedonians. But in 169 BC he changed sides and allied himself with Perseus of Macedon. During the &quot;Third Illyrian War&quot;, in 168 BC, he arrested two Roman legati and destroyed the cities of Apollonia and Dyrrhachium, which were allied to Rome. He was defeated at Scodra by a Roman force under L. Anicius Gallus, and in 167 BC he was brought to Rome as a captive to participate in Gallus&#x27; triumph, after which he was interned at Iguvium.

==Prelude==

===Expansion under Agron===
In the second half of the third century BC, the Ardiaei kingdom was transformed into a formidable power under the leadership of Agron. During this time, Agron invaded part of Corcyra, Epidamnos and Pharos in succession, establishing garrisons in them. An invasion towards Epirus was repulsed. The new force disposed of &#x27;the most powerful which could carry 50 soldiers in addition to the rowersforce, both by land and sea, of any of the kings who had reigned in Illyria before him&#x27;, according to Polybius (2.2). The Illyrians used the lembus, a small and fast warship with a single bank of oars. Raids by sea from the Adriatic and Ionian were probably a familiar threat to the north-western Greeks. What was new was the use of a land army to follow up and profit from the victories gained by the navy. The Greek cities (&quot;poleis&quot;) on the coast of Illyria were systematically attacked and perhaps already conquered by Agron&#x27;s forces. Rome answered an appeal from the island of Issa, threatened by Agron, by sending envoys. They never got there. They were attacked en route by Illyrian vessels, and one of them was killed, together with an Issaean ambassador.

That time a number of political events marked the adjacent Greek states. In 234 BC, the royal succession in Epirus came to an end, and a federal republic was instituted. In the south, the western part of Acarnania seceded from this arrangement. Their independence was soon threatened by the Aetolians, who began to occupy territory around the Gulf of Ambracia, including Pyrrhus&#x27; old capital, Ambracia, which forced the Epirotes to establish a new center at Phoenice. Besieged at Medion, the Acarnanians sought assistance from Demetrius II of Macedonia, who for the most of his reign had been at war with the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues. In response, the king requested assistance from Agron to relieve the siege.

The Illyrian attack under Agron was mounted in either 232 or 231 BC. One hundred lembi, with 5000 men on board, sailed up to land at Medion. They then formed up in the order that was usual in their own country, and advanced in their several companies against the Aetolian lines. The Aetolians drew up the greater part of their hoplites and cavalry in front of their own lines on the level ground and, with a portion of their cavalry and their light infantry, they hastened to occupy some rising ground in front of their camp, which nature had made easily defensible. A single charge, however, by the Illyrians, whose numbers and close order gave them irresistible weight, served to dislodge the light-armed troops, and forced the cavalry who were on the ground with them to retire to the hoplites. The Medionians joined the action by sallying out of the town and charging the Aetolians, thus, after killing a great number, and taking a still greater number prisoners, and becoming masters also of their arms and baggage, the Illyrians, having carried out the orders of Agron, conveyed their baggage and the rest of their booty to their boats and immediately set sail for their own country. This defeat of the Aetolians, who were famed for their victory over the invading Gauls a generation before, caused a sensation in Greece.

===Raid against Phoenice===

Illyrian success continued when command passed to Agron&#x27;s widow Teuta, who granted individual ships a license to universal plunder. In 231 BC, the fleet and army attacked Elis and Messenia in the Peloponnese. On the way home, Teuta sent her general Scerdilaidas to capture the city of Phoenice in Epirus. The city was captured and the ensuing battle was won. A truce was agreed and Phoenice was returned for a price, along with the release of prisoners. The continued Illyrian success was another shock for the Greeks. The Epirotes signified their acceptance of the Illyrian victory by sending envoys to Teuta promising cooperation with them and hostility towards the Leagues of Greece. Phoenice was the most prosperous city in Epirus, and the centre for the growing commerce with Italy. It was Illyrian interference with that commerce that brought Roman forces across the Adriatic for the first time. Nevertheless, the Illyrians had to withdraw from Phoenice in order to deal with an internal rebellion.

==First Illyrian War==

Even before the war with Carthage (264–241 BC), the Romans had been aware of the danger to the Adriatic coast of Italy from seaborne attack. In 246 BC, a colony of Roman citizens was settled at Brundisium to keep a watch on the Ionian gulf. During their occupation of Phoenice, a number of Illyrian ships had engaged in privateering against Italian merchants. So many were robbed, murdered or captured that the Roman Senate, after ignoring earlier complaints, realized that something had to be done. Polybius (2.8) furnishes a suspiciously vivid account of a Roman embassy to Teuta, a version of events that was intended to justify the Roman invasion of Illyria. It was led by the brothers L. and C. Coruncanius. On arrival, they found Teuta celebrating the end of a rebellion in Illyria and engaged in laying siege to the Greek island of Issa, &#x27;the last town which held out&#x27;. When the ambassadors complained of injuries to Romans, Teuta promised that no royal forces would harm them, but said that she was unable to put an end to the tradition of private enterprise. One of the ambassadors lost his temper; in response, the queen arranged for the insolent envoy to be murdered on his homeward voyage. News of this caused the Romans to prepare for war: legions were raised and a fleet assembled, and there was general indignation at &#x27;the queen&#x27;s violation of the law of nations&#x27;.

===Corcyra and Paxos (229 BC)===

The Roman invasion of Illyria in 229 BC appears to have caught Teuta completely off guard. As soon as the weather permitted, Teuta had ordered south a naval expedition even larger than those of previous years, with most of the ships heading to attack Corcyra. Some landed at Epidamnos, entered the city, with weapons concealed, to procure food and water, almost capturing it; but were thrown out after a fight. These ships now joined the main Illyrian force in the siege of Corcyra. The Corcyraeans, along with Appolonia and Epidamnos, sought assistance from the Leagues of Greece. Ten Achaean ships were engaged by the Illyrian fleet, reinforced by seven warships of the Acarnanians, off the island Paxos south of Corcyra. By superior tactics, the Illyrians took four triremes and sank a quinquereme, while the rest of the Greeks managed to escape. Corcyra was surrendered and was occupied by a garrison under the command of Demetrius of Pharos. The main Illyrian force sailed north for another attack on Epidamnos. The Illyrians were now on the point of controlling all of the coastline north of the Gulf of Corinth, including all of the sea routes to Sicily and Italy via Corcyra.

===Roman offensive===
The Roman consul Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus sailed his 200 ships to Corcyra to raise the siege, despite having learned that the island had already surrendered. He was in secret negotiations with Demetrius, who had fallen out of favour with Teuta, so Corcyra welcomed the Romans and, with the aid of Demetrius, surrendered its garrison. The city became a &#x27;friend of Rome&#x27; and would henceforward rely on Roman protection from the Illyrians. Demetrius now served as an adviser to the Roman commanders for the rest of the war. Meanwhile, the consul Lucius Postumius Albinus brought an army of 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry across from Brundisium to Apollonia, which now joined the Roman alliance. The fleet under Fulvius reached Apollonia and the two forces advanced toward Epidamnos, causing the Illyrians to abandon the siege and disperse. The city was received into Roman protection and the army now moved inland among the Illyrian peoples of the hinterland. Here, the Romans received delegations from many peoples, including the Atintani and Parthini, from whom a formal surrender was accepted. At sea, the blockade of Issa was raised and the city also received Roman protection. As the Romans approached the Illyrian heartlands, opposition stiffened. The fleet moved northwards and attacked coastal towns, one of which being the unidentified Noutria. Roman losses included a magistrate of the Republic and some military tribunes, although 20 ships laden with plunder were intercepted. The besiegers of Issa fled to Arbo and Teuta retreated to her capital, Rhizon in the Gulf of Kotor. The Romans decided enough had been achieved and hostilities ceased. The consuls handed over the kingdom to Demetrius and withdrew the fleet and army to Italy under Fulvius. Having assembled 40 ships and some troops from allies in the area, the other consul remained in Illyria to keep watch on the Ardiaei and the peoples under Roman protection.

===Peace treaty (228 BC)===
Before the end of winter, Teuta&#x27;s envoys appeared in Rome and a treaty was concluded. According to its terms, the queen would pay tribute (or perhaps an indemnity) to Rome, abandon Illyria, except for a few places, and promise not to sail south of Lissus at the mouth of the Drin with more than two ships, and even those had to be unarmed. The terms of the settlement were conveyed to the Leagues in Greece, where they were well received. The Illyrians had been forced to give up all their recent conquests south of the Drin. The Romans had gained control of the strategic ports of Epidamnos, Apollonia and Corcyra. In the hinterland, several of the Illyrian tribes now had the status of Rome clients, as was certainly the case with the Parthini in the Gensus (Shkumbin) valley and the Atintani further south. Moreover, not only were the Ardiaei prevented from moving at will by land and sea into Epirus and western Greece, but they were now cut off from the inland route to Macedonia, their patron and ally against the Greek Leagues.

==Second Illyrian War==
===Revival of power===
The decade after 229 BC witnessed a revival of Illyrian power under Demetrius, who succeeded Teuta. Following the war, Demetrius married Triteuta, Agron&#x27;s first wife and mother of Pinnes, in or around 222 BC, which consolidated his position. His marriage to Triteuta meant that Demetrius formally took over the regency of the Ardiaean Kingdom. Demetrius&#x27; own influence was thereby greatly extended, and the fundamental weakness of the Ardiaean Kingdom after 229 BC, that there was no competent regent for Pinnes, was relieved. The king began to renew traditional Illyrian ties with Macedonia. In 222 BC, an Illyrian corps of 1,600 men fought with distinction under the command of Demetrius at Sellasia, where the Macedonians won a conclusive victory over the Spartans. After Sellasia, Demetrius began attempting to extend his control over Illyria at the expense of Rome.

Before then, when Rome was preoccupied with a war against the Celtic peoples of the Po Valley in northern Italy from 225 to 222 BC, Demetrius detached the Illyrian Atintani from their Roman alliance. In addition, he sailed south of Lissus, Lezhë in present-day Albania, and engaged in piracy in contravention of the settlement in 228 BC. In 221 BC, Demetrius also created an alliance with the Illyrian Histri at the head of the Adriatic, which tribe was interfering with Roman supply ships. A Roman fleet soon attacked the Histri. Early in the summer of 221 BC, when tension was rising in Greece as Macedonia made an alliance with the Achaean League against the Aetolian League, the Illyrians attacked in their traditional manner.

In 220 BC, Demetrius and the Illyrian commander, Scerdilaidas, sailed south of Lissus with 90 lembi. An assault on Pylos in the western Peloponnese initially failed, but Demetrius eventually captured 50 ships. Afterwards, the Illyrians separated their forces; Demetrius and his forces plundered the Cyclades, while Scerdilaidas&#x27; forces returned north to Illyria. On putting in at Naupactus with forty ships, Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his brother-in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join the Aetolians in their planned invasion of Achaea. With help from Cynaethan traitors, they attacked, seized and burned Cynaetha, a town in northern Arcadia located on the northern slope of the Aroanian Mountains. They also attacked, but failed to take, Cleitor. Meanwhile, Demetrius continued on into the Aegean with 50 ships. He sailed to the Cyclades, where he extorted tribute from some of the islands and plundered the others. Chased by Rhodian warships, Demetrius put into Cenchreae, the Aegean port of Corinth. At the same time, the Macedonian commander in Corinth, Taurion, learned of the invasion by Scerdilaidas and the Aetolians. Taking his cue from the Aetolians, Taurion agreed to drag Demetrius&#x27; ships across the Isthmus to bring them into play in the Gulf of Corinth, in return for Demetrius&#x27; assistance against the Aetolians. Although Demetrius conducted a few raids on the Aetolian coast, he was too late to hinder the Aetolians&#x27; return from Achaea.

After returning to the Ardiaean Kingdom, Demetrius continued operations during the following winter, attacking and seizing Roman allied cities and communities in southern Illyria. The Romans, who had hitherto ignored the activities of their former ally, decided that the harbors on the Ardiaean Kingdom&#x27;s coast now had to be made secure, in view of the threat of another war with Carthage. These events precipitated the Second Illyrian War.

===Surrender of Dimallum (219 BC)===
Unlike Teuta in 229 BC, Demetrius was well prepared for the Roman invasion. He first placed a garrison in Dimallum, an Illyrian city-fortress from Apollonia. He eliminated his opponents in other places, those Illyrians who opposed his rule, and stationed 6,000 of his best forces on his home island of Pharos. As before, both consuls of the year accompanied the Roman expedition, but the leading role was played by Aemilius Paullus, who was to be killed in the great Roman disaster at Cannae three years later. The Adriatic took on particular importance in Rome&#x27;s preparations for the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC. Anticipating a long and difficult war far away from Rome, the Roman Senate decided first to set matters right in Illyria.

In 219 BC, having decided that Dimallum was crucial to Demetrius&#x27; power in the region, the consul prepared to besiege the city, but was able to take it by direct assault within seven days. As a result, all the Illyrian towns and cities of the area submitted to Roman protection, each receiving the appropriate terms and conditions. Next, the Romans moved against Demetrius on the island of Pharos, who awaited the attack with good troops, ample provisions and war materials behind strong fortifications, that of the modern port city of Stari Grad. To avoid a long siege, Aemilius decided to risk another frontal attack. The Roman army moved from the mainland to a wooded area of the island. Meanwhile, the next day, a small force of ships was sent out to tempt Demetrius from behind his fortifications. Demetrius marched down to the harbor to oppose the Roman landing. The strategy worked, and when the main Roman army appeared from another direction on the island, the Illyrian army was forced to give battle, as they were cut off from their city. Attacked on two sides, and cut off from the protection of the city walls, the battle was lost. In 218 BC, the Illyrian forces soon surrendered, while Demetrius deserted the island and fled to Macedonia, making his way to the court of Philip V of Macedon, who was now the Macedonian king following the death of Antigonus.

===Aftermath===
The Romans destroyed the fortifications of Pharos and before the summer was over Aemilius was back in Rome receiving congratulations for a job well done. Any threat to Roman holdings in Illyria had been eliminated, all the gains of the First Illyrian War had been secured, and the old restrictions on movement imposed on Illyrian kings. Demetrius may have returned to the Ardiaeian State and have been attacked by another Roman force, although the regime of Pinnes, now confirmed as king, was left intact. Rome supported a small Ardiaeian State ruled by Pinnes and his successors. The Roman Republic called for the extradition of Demetrius, but Phillip refused. Pinnes was ordered to pay the arrears of tribute, reparations imposed after the war. The weak Ardiaeian state soon fell prey to Macedonia, while the partial destruction brought onto the scene the urban koina of the Parthini, Byllines, Amantini and others.

==Third Illyrian War==

===Relations with Rome===
By 181 BC, the loyal Pleuratus III had been succeeded by his son Gentius. During his reign, relations with the Ardiaean State and Rome started to deteriorate. The coast and hinterland south of the Drin remained under Roman control since the First Illyrian War against Teuta. Gentius moved to increase Illyrian power over kindred peoples living to the north and west. Among the islands, the Greek city of Issa had retained some form of independence under Roman protection but Pharos remained an Illyrian possession. On the mainland, the Delmatae and the Daorsi were at one time subjects, but the former defected soon after the accession of Gentius. Illyrian strength lay in its navy and it was their interference with Adriatic shipping that once more aroused Roman interest in the area.

In 180 BC, a Roman praetor responsible for coastal protection arrived in Brundisium with some of Gentius&#x27;s ships that were said to have been caught in the act of piracy. An embassy to Illyria failed to locate the king; but the praetor discovered that Romans were being held for ransom at Corcyra Nigra. No outcome of the affair is reported and it may well be that the Senate accepted a claim by Gentius&#x27; envoys that the charges were false. Ten years later, when Rome was gripped with war fever against Perseus of Macedon, Issa accused Gentius of plotting war with the king and so the Illyrian envoys were denied a hearing before the Senate. Instead, the Romans seized 54 Illyrian lembi at anchor in the harbor of Epidamnus. On the eve of war, a Roman senator was sent to Illyria to remind Gentius of his formal friendship with the Roman Republic.

===Alliance with Dardania and Macedonia===
In 169 BC, Gentius arranged the murder of his brother, Plator, because Plator&#x27;s plan to marry Etuta, daughter of the Dardanian king, Monunius II of Dardania, would have made him too powerful. Gentius then married Plator&#x27;s fiancée for himself, securing the alliance of the powerful Dardanian State.

Perseus of Macedon, having recaptured several Roman outposts in Roman occupied Illyria, controlled the route leading west to the Ardiaean State. At this point, Perseus sent his first embassy to Gentius, consisting of the Illyrian exile Pleuratus, for his command of the Illyrian language, and the Macedonians Adaeus and Beroea. They found Gentius at Lissus and informed him of Perseus&#x27; successes against the Romans and Dardanians and his recent victory against the Penestae. Gentius replied that he lacked not the will to fight the Romans, but only the money. No promises were made on this point either by this embassy or another sent from Stuberra shortly afterwards. Perseus continued his efforts to involve Gentius in the war—preferably, it was said, at no cost to his treasury. The Illyrian exile Pleuratus raised 1,000 infantry and 200 cavalry from the Penestae. The Roman invasion of Macedonia in 168 BC forced the king to promise a subsidy to Gentius, whose ships might be employed to attack the Romans. A sum of 300 talents was mentioned and Perseus sent his companion Pantauchus to make the arrangements. In the city of Meteon, hostages were agreed and Gentius accepted the oath of the king. He sent Olympio with a delegation to Perseus to collect the money, and the treaty was concluded with some ceremony at Dium on the Thermaic Gulf. A formal parade of the Macedonian cavalry was held, which may have impressed the Illyrians; the cavalry may have represented the Macedonians in the ratification of the treaty.

The 300 talents were counted out of the royal treasure at Pella and the Illyrians were permitted to mark it with their own stamp. An advance of this money was forwarded to Gentius; and when this was passed over by Pantauchus, the king was urged to commence hostilities against the Romans. When Gentius imprisoned two Roman envoys sent by Appius Claudius at Lychnidus, Perseus recalled the rest of the subsidy in the belief that Gentius was now his ally, come what may.

===Anti-Roman policy===

Gentius accompanied the new anti-Roman orientation in Illyrian foreign policy with a series of measures to strengthen the Ardiaean State. First, he concentrated the finances by establishing a single tax over all the subjects and by taking royal control of the monetary workshops, or mints, of Lissus and Scodra, the two cities where he resided. At this time, Gentius was issuing bronze coins. In the Selcë hoard, there are two coins of Gentius with Macedonian emblems. The other coins of Gentius have what is probably his head with a cap not unlike the petasos, and a torc around his head, and on the reverse in one case a thunderbolt and in the other a lembus, the typical Illyrian warship. Thus, according to an inventory made by the Romans, the state treasury had 27 pounds of gold, 19 of silver, 120,000 Illyrian drachmas and 13,000 Roman denarii on the eve of the war with Rome.

Gentius and Perseus sent a joined embassy to invite Rhodes to join in the war against Rome. Gentius also built up a fleet of 270 lembi, a fact showing that the enemy he was prepared to face would come across the Adriatic. An army of 15,000 men completed the military machine of the Ardiaean State. Gentius was now prepared to go to war with Rome.

===Destruction of the Illyrian kingdom (168 BC)===

Having mustered his force of 15,000 men and his fleet of lembi at Lissus, the southernmost city of the State, Gentius advanced into Roman territory in January/February of 168 BC and laid siege to the Illyrian city of Bassania, a Roman ally that refused to yield, although it was only 5 miles from Lissus. His half-brother Caravantius detached 1,000 infantry and 50 horsemen and attacked the Cavii, failing to capture one of their cities while ravaging the fields of the city of Caravandis. A fleet of eight lembi set off a little later to attack the coastal colonial cities of Epidamnus and Appolonia. Meanwhile, the Romans under Appius Claudius had heard of the alliance that Gentius had made with Perseus of Macedon and the arrest of the Roman envoys. He therefore moved his army out of their winter quarters at Nymphaeum, added to it troops from Byllis, Epidamnus, and Appolonia, as he marched north, and encamped by the river Genesus. There, he met with the new Roman commander, Lucius Anicius Gallus, a praetor. Anicius had crossed over from Italy to Apollonia with two legions totalling 600 cavalry and 10,400 infantry and of Italian allies, 800 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. His fleet, the size of which is not known, was strengthened by a draft of 5,000 sailors. To this imposing force, he added 200 cavalry and 2,000 infantry of the Parthini, an Illyrian kingdom allied to the Romans. These combined forces outnumbered those of Gentius&#x27;s by two to one.

As a folio of Livy&#x27;s text is missing, little is known of this campaign. It seems that Anicius&#x27;s fleets engaged Gentius&#x27; lembi and captured a number of them. Next, the Illyrian forces were defeated on land, allowing the Romans to advance to the heart of the state, where they won over the cities by humane and clement methods. Gentius concentrated his forces in his capital Shkodra, a well-fortified city in a strong natural position. When Anicius approached with his army in battle formation, Gentius fled into the city in panic. Gentius asked for, and was given, a three-day truce hoping that Caravantius would come at any moment with a large relieving army, but it did not happen. After his defeat, Gentius sent two prominent tribal leaders, Teuticus and Bellus, as envoys to negotiate with the Roman commander. On the third day of the truce, Gentius surrendered to the Romans, who gave him a dinner with full honours and then put him under arrest. The Illyrians in Shkodra surrendered and the Roman envoys were liberated. The Roman army marched north of Scutari Lake where, at Meteon, they captured Gentius&#x27; queen Etuta, his brother Caravantius, his sons Scerdilaides and Pleuratus along with leading Illyrians.

The fall of the Ardiaean State is transmitted by Livy in a ceremonial manner of the triumph of Anicius in Rome: 

&quot;In a few days, both on land and sea did he defeat the brave Illyrian tribe, who had relied on their knowledge of their own territory and fortifications&quot;
This part of the campaign had only lasted 30 days. There were certainly further operations in the northern part of the Ardiaean State, for Anicius placed garrisons in some towns, citadels and fortresses. These include the cities of Issa, Rhizon and Olcinium and the tribal states of the Daorsi and the Pirustae. Some came over to Rome on their own accord, while other places, such as Pharos, were reduced by force and their property looted.

===Aftermath===
Rome&#x27;s triumph included the capture of many royal flags, other booty, the furniture of the king himself and the treasure mentioned above. Millions of sestercii were gained from the sale of the booty, in addition to the gold and silver that went to the state treasury.

By decision of the Senate, Gentius and his family were sent to Spoletum, to be kept under observation. The other captives were imprisoned in Rome. But the inhabitants of Spoletum refused to keep the royal family under watch, so they were transferred to Iguvium. The booty seized in Illyria included 220 vessels. By decree of the Senate, C. Cassius Longinus gave these vessels taken from Gentius to the inhabitants of Corcyra, Appolonia and Epidamnus. The year of Gentius&#x27; death is not known, but there are ruins of what is perhaps his tomb.

The Roman punishment of Illyria spared only those kingdoms that had backed Rome openly in the war. For those who had been enemies, their cities, buildings and public institutions were burned and thoroughly looted. Those spared retained their previous manner of administration, with officials elected every year, and paid Rome only half the taxes that they had previously paid to Gentius. The federation-based kingdoms were dissolved and each unit was recognized as a separate kingdom, enjoying local autonomy and often the right to mint its own coins.

While the southern Illyrian lands had been subjected once and for all, the Roman legions continued for about another hundred years with attempts to conquer the northern and eastern territories.

<text>International Community Radio Taipei (ICRT; ) is Taiwan&#x27;s only English-language radio station and first radio station in Taiwan that caters to foreigners. Prior to 1979, the station served the U.S. military personnel in Taiwan as the Armed Forces Network Taiwan (AFNT). When the United States broke diplomatic ties with the Republic of China in 1979, the American business community, with the help of the ROC government, reorganized the station into ICRT.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

From 1957 to 1979, the station served the US military community in Taiwan as the Armed Forces Network Taiwan (AFNT). After the United States broke diplomatic ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan in 1979, Rear Admiral James B. Linder, last commander of the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC), informed a letter to the Taiwanese Government Information Office (GIO) pointing out that equipments of the AFNT be transferred to the ROC Government by the US Federal Government without compensation. The new radio station, under the name of ICRT, was reorganized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) and the ROC government.

=== Early period ===

ICRT enjoyed immense popularity during its first fifteen years. The station offered two channels: AM 200 and FM 989. Both channels provided similar content of foreign pop and rock, with the difference that FM100 also had daily five-minute news at the top of every hour, one-hour morning and evening news programs, and three hours of classical music on Sunday nights.

ICRT&#x27;s news coverage was renowned. Live top-of-the-hour news segments were broadcast 24 hours-a-day. Members of the news team were often dispatched to report live from the scene of an event. ICRT&#x27;s news coverage was also noted for covering controversial or sensitive political topics at a time when Taiwan was just coming out of martial law. In a period heavily dominated by a KMT-leaning media, ICRT gave a voice to the opposition party, facilitating a fair exchange of ideas.

=== 1990s ===

The station started to suffer from operating challenges in the 1990s. The ROC government liberalized the radio market, forcing ICRT to face competition from other radio stations. AM576&#x27;s programming lineup became weaker and lacked DJs to cover the entire twenty-four hours of air time, resulting in an automated jukebox system to replace the DJ. Eventually AM576 only broadcast the BBC World Service and CNN Radio and then went permanently off the air in 1999. News coverage in FM100 was gradually downsized. In 2000, ICRT moved from its original location on Yangmingshan to Taipei City.

== ICRT today ==

=== News and current affairs ===

ICRT provides news throughout the day, beginning with content from the BBC, then moving into an hour-long morning news special, in which the morning crew cover local, international, sport and business news.

==== &quot;Taiwan Talk&quot; ====

In 2012, ICRT launched a new feature called &quot;Taiwan Talk&quot;, a twice-weekly program designed to enhance ICRT&#x27;s local news coverage. Hosted by reporter Eryk Smith up until the end of 2013, the news segment features interviews with members of the local community. Notable past interviewees include Taiwan 2012 presidential candidate Tsai Ying-wen, Indian novelist Pankaj Mishra, National Immigration Agency Director, Hsieh Li-kung (謝立功), and William Stanton (diplomat), the director of the American Institute in Taiwan. Currently the program is hosted by Alex Lewis.

==== &quot;EZ News&quot; ====

As part of ICRT&#x27;s role as a bridge between the foreign and domestic community, two news broadcasts per day are designated &quot;EZ News&quot;. The vocabulary is deliberately simplified, the reading speed is lowered, and a transcript is provided to aid English learners. In 2012, an extra podcast was added featuring the EZ News broadcast read at an even slower speed.

==== &quot;Game On!&quot; ====

&quot;Game On!&quot; is a segment focused on developments in the world of videogames. It ran from 2009 to 2014.

=== Cultural exchange ===

==== &quot;A-Fu&#x27;s Taxi&quot; ====

&quot;A-Fu&#x27;s Taxi&quot; is a short feature designed to teach simple Chinese. The format is always the same: a foreigner gets into A-Fu&#x27;s taxi cab and strikes up a conversation centered on the intended destination. Over the course of this dialogue, A-Fu teaches the foreigner a few Mandarin Chinese words or phrases.

==== &quot;Language Links&quot; ====

&quot;Language Links&quot; is a short program designed to teach English vocabulary. It features a dialogue, often humorous in nature, centered on a theme. Key words are then explained in English and Mandarin Chinese. &quot;Language Links&quot; is also published as an English-learning textbook, in which the dialogues are presented in cartoon form, and extended explanations and information on the same theme is given.

==== &quot;We Love Hakka&quot; ====

&quot;We Love Hakka&quot; is a special program, presented in Mandarin Chinese and English, which aims to introduce Hakka language and culture. Hakka sights, proverbs and cultural events are described in the program, along with a few words in the Hakka language.

=== Notable programming ===

==== &quot;Jazz Flavors&quot; ====

&quot;Jazz Flavors&quot; is a 2-hour, Sunday night show. It is the longest-running program on ICRT.
The show features the very latest music by the top jazz artists of the day. While mostly consisting of modern jazz, the blues, R&amp;B, and Latin are also programmed.

==== Radio plays ====

In 2012, ICRT teamed up with a Taipei-based drama group, Red Room Radio Redux, to begin production of radio plays. The inaugural production was Charles Dickens’ &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which aired on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Planned future productions include Orson Welles’ &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

== Events ==

=== ICRT Bike Day ===

ICRT regularly holds &quot;bike days&quot;: public events in which hundreds of people gather to cycle on scenic routes across Taiwan. The events are curated by station DJs. ICRT held its first bike day in Tainan in June 2009. Since then, each year a bike day event is held in Northern, Central and Southern Taiwan respectively. In the four years since its inception, the ICRT Bike Day has been held 11 times.

=== Battle of the Bands ===

The ICRT Battle of the Bands event has been held six times, beginning in 2007. Local bands are invited to compete in front of a panel of judges and a live audience. The winning band receives a cash prize, musical equipment and the chance to be championed on ICRT. Previous winners of the competition have included High Tide (2008), who went on to perform at the Fuji Rock festival; I.O. (2009), later nominated for &quot;Best Band&quot; and &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; at the Golden Melody Awards; and most recently Trash (2012).

<text>Floating Power was a technology developed in the 1920s by the United States automobile firm Chrysler. It is credited mostly to the engineering of Owen Ray Skelton. It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, with the intention of reducing vibration. Four-cylinder engines of the day transmitted torque to the entire chassis, producing considerable vibration. Attaching the engine at only two points (&quot;fore-and-aft&quot;), defining an axis that passes through the engine&#x27;s center of mass, allowed the engine to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis. One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump. The rear mount was under the transmission case. A transverse spring went from the bottom of the engine to a snubber bracket on the frame rail to limit the engine&#x27;s rotational travel. The bracket was lined with rubber.

Advertisers gave this concept a meaningful name. It was used on the Plymouth and other Chrysler Corporation cars starting in the 1930s. The French firm Citroën leased the technology for its front-wheel drive car of the 1930s.

<text>Jacques Charles François Sturm (29 September 1803 – 15 December 1855) was a French mathematician, who made a significant addition to equation theory with his work, Sturm&#x27;s theorem.

== Early life ==
Sturm was born in Geneva, France in 1803. The family of his father, Jean-Henri Sturm, had emigrated from Strasbourg around 1760—about 50 years before Charles-François&#x27;s birth. His mother&#x27;s name was Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Gremay.

In 1818, he started to follow the lectures of the academy of Geneva. The death of his father forced Sturm to give lessons to children of the rich in order to support his own family the following year. In 1823, he became tutor to the son of Madame de Staël.

At the end of that year, Sturm stayed in Paris for a short time following the family of his student. He resolved, with his school-fellow Jean-Daniel Colladon, to try his fortune in Paris, and obtained employment on the &quot;Bulletin universel&quot;.

== Discovery ==
In 1829, he discovered the theorem that bears his name, and concerns real-root isolation, that is the determination of the number and the localization of the real roots of a polynomial.

== Work ==
Sturm benefited from the 1830 revolution, as his Protestant faith ceased to be an obstacle to employment in public high schools. At the end of 1830, he was thus appointed as a professor of Mathématiques Spéciales at the collège Rollin.

He was chosen a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1836, filling the seat of André-Marie Ampère. Sturm became &quot;répétiteur&quot; in 1838, and in 1840 professor in the École Polytechnique. The same year, after the death of Poisson, Sturm was appointed as mechanics professor of the . His works, &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;école polytechnique&quot; (1857–1863) and &quot;Cours de mécanique de l&#x27;école polytechnique&quot; (1861), were published after his death in Paris, and were regularly republished.

He was the co-eponym of the Sturm–Liouville theory with Joseph Liouville.

In 1826, with his colleague Jean-Daniel Colladon, Sturm helped make the first experimental determination of the speed of sound in water.

== Death ==
In 1851 his health began to fail. He was able to return to teaching for a while during his long illness, but died in 1855.

The asteroid 31043 Sturm is named for him. Sturm&#x27;s name is one of the 72 names engraved at the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="1181555" wikidata="Q1067778" url="?curid=1181555" title="Banner blindness">
<text>Banner blindness is a phenomenon in web usability where visitors to a website consciously or unconsciously ignore banner-like information. A broader term covering all forms of advertising is ad blindness, and the mass of banners that people ignore is called banner noise.

The term &quot;banner blindness&quot; was coined in 1998 as a result of website usability tests where a majority of the test subjects either consciously or unconsciously ignored information that was presented in banners. The information that was overlooked included both external advertisement banners and internal navigational banners, often called &quot;quick links&quot;.

This does not, however, mean that banner ads do not influence viewers. Website viewers may not be consciously aware of an ad, but it does have an unconscious influence on their behavior. A banner&#x27;s content affects both businesses and visitors of the site. Native advertising and social media are used to avoid banner blindness.

== Factors ==

=== Human behavior ===

==== User goals ====
When searching for specific information on a website, users focus only on the parts of the page where they expect that information will be, e.g. small text and hyperlinks. A 2011 study investigated via eye-tracking analysis whether users avoided looking at ads inserted on a non-search website, and whether they retained ad content in memory. The study found that most participants fixated (looked at) ads at least once during their website visit. When a viewer is working on a task, ads may cause a disturbance, eventually leading to ad avoidance. If a user wants to find something on the web page and ads disrupt or delay their search, they will try to avoid the source of interference.

==== Clutter aversion ====
A higher than expected number of advertisements may cause a user to view the page as cluttered. The number of adverts and annoyances on a webpage contribute to this perception of clutter. As users can concentrate on only one stimulus at a time, having too many objects in their field of vision causes them to lose focus. This contributes to behaviors such as ad avoidance or banner blindness.

==== Website familiarity ====
As a user becomes familiar with a webpage, they learn where to expect content, and where to expect adverts, and learn to ignore banner ads without looking at them. Usability tests that compared the perception of banners between subjects searching for specific information and subjects aimlessly browsing seem to support this theory. A 2014 eye-tracking study examined how right-side images (in contrast to plain text) in Google AdWords affect users&#x27; visual behavior. The analysis concludes that the appearance of images does not change user interaction with ads.

==== Brand recognition ====
If a user is already aware of a brand, viewing an ad banner for that brand would reconfirm their existing attitudes towards it, whether positive or negative. A banner ad may only leave a positive impression in the viewer if they already have a positive perception of the brand. Similarly, someone seeing an ad for a brand they have a negative perception of may further dissuade them from buying from that brand.

If viewers have a neutral or no opinion about a brand, then a banner ad for that brand could leave a positive impression, due to the mere-exposure effect: A tendency to develop a preference for something due to familiarity.

=== Banner aspects ===
==== Shared space ====
Unlike advertisements in television or radio, which completely interrupt and temporarily replace the content, banner adverts exist alongside the content. Websites typically contain various elements in different sizes, shapes, and colours. As a banner ad only occupies part of a website, it cannot hold the user&#x27;s complete attention.

==== Perceived usefulness ====
Banner ads that seem to contain useful information, and which are easy for the viewer to comprehend, are more likely to be viewed and clicked on than adverts the user does not find useful, or finds difficult to understand.

Prices and promotions, when mentioned in banner ads, do not have a major impact on their perceived usefulness. Users assume that all ads signify promotions of some sort and hence do not give much weight to it.

==== Congruence ====
Congruity is the relationship of an advert with the surrounding web content. There have been mixed results of congruity on users. Click through rates increased when the ads shown on a website were similar to the products or services of that website. A banner with colour schemes incongruent with the rest of website does grab the viewer&#x27;s attention, but they tend to respond negatively to it, compared with banners whose color schemes were congruent.

Congruency has more impact when the user browses fewer web pages. When users were given specific web tasks in a 2013 study, incongruent ads grabbed their attention, but they displayed ad avoidance behaviors. The relevance of the ad&#x27;s content to the user&#x27;s goal and to the website does not affect view time due to the expectation that an advert will be irrelevant.

Congruency between the advert and the web content has no effect on view duration, according to a 2011 study.

==== Calls to action ====
Banners with phrases that invite action, such as &quot;click here&quot;, do not attract views or clicks.

== Prevention and subversion ==

Advertisers and webmasters may attempt to prevent or subvert banner blindness by eliminating one or more possible causes:

=== Location ===
Users generally read webpage from top left to bottom right, so adverts in this path may be more noticeable. As viewers are less likely to notice something in their peripheral vision, adverts to the right of the page content will be seen less than adverts to the left. Banner ads just below the navigation area may be viewed more, as users expect content at the top of the page. Confusion about whether the top of page has content or advertisement results in more views of the advert.

=== Animation ===
Users dislike animated ads since they can cause loss of focus. This distraction may increase the attention of some users when they are involved in free browsing (not seeking to complete a specific goal). Users involved in a specific task typically fail to recall animated ads, take longer to complete their task, and experience an increased perceived workload. Moderate animation can increase recognition rates. Rapidly animated banner ads can cause lower recognition rates of the advert itself, and negative attitudes toward the advertiser.

In visual search tasks, animated ads did not impact the performance of users and did not capture more views than static ads. Animations signal to users of the existence of ads and lead to ad avoidance behavior, but repetitive exposure to them can induce the mere exposure effect.

=== Personalization and relevance ===
Personalized ads use and include information about viewers, like demographics, PII, and purchasing habits. An ad is noticed more if it has a higher degree of personalization, even if it causes discomfort in users. Personalized ads are found to be clicked more often than other ads. If a user is involved in a demanding task, more attention is paid to a personalized ad than an unpersonalised ad.

Such ads do, however, increase privacy concerns and can appear &#x27;creepy&#x27;. An individual with greater existing privacy concerns will avoid personalised ads, primarily due to concerns over their data being shared with third parties. Users are more likely to accept behavior tracking if they have faith in the company that permitted the ad. Though this can be an effective method for advertisers, users do not always prefer their behaviors be used to personalize ads. Ads are more often clicked when they show something relevant to the user&#x27;s search but if the purchase has been made, and the ad continues to appear, it causes frustration.

Personalization enhanced recognition for the content of banners while the effect on attention was weaker and less significant, in the studies conducted by Koster et al. Exploration of web pages and recognition of task-relevant information was not influenced. Visual exploration of banners typically proceeds from the picture to the logo and finally to the slogan.

If a website serves ads unrelated to its viewers&#x27; interests, about 75% of viewers experience frustration with the website. Advertising efforts must focus on the user&#x27;s current intention and interest and not just previous searches. Publishing fewer, but more relative, ads is more effective.

Advertisers may use data analytics and campaign management tools to categorise viewers and serve ads that are more likely to be relevant to the user&#x27;s interests. Information about users could be gained through gamification tools which could reward them for providing that information. Such tools could be quizzes, calculators, chats, or questionnaires.

=== Native ads ===
Native advertising often places adverts inline with expected, non-ad content. For example, video advertisements playing within a video-streaming website before, during, or after the main video feature. Another common format is a text or image advert within a social media feed, formatted to resemble posts made by users.

Native ads are designed to resemble the user&#x27;s expected experience. They can have greater viewability than other forms of advertising because they are less easy to distinguish from expected, non-advert content.

=== Social media ===
Through social media, advertisers can transfer feelings of trust in known individuals to adverts, thereby validating the ads. Peer pressure can encourage users to change attitudes or behavior regarding advertising to adapt to group customs. Advertisement through known people piqued interests of users and increased ad views much more effectively than banner ads.

<text>Griselio Torresola Roura (July 19, 1925 – November 1, 1950) was a Puerto Rican militant of the Nationalist Party. He and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate United States President Harry Truman on November 1, 1950. Torresola mortally wounded White House policeman Private Leslie Coffelt and wounded two other law enforcement officers. Torresola was killed by a return shot from Coffelt.

== Early life and political background ==
Torresola was born in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. His family believed in the Puerto Rican independence cause. They had participated in many of the island&#x27;s past revolts. At the age of 23 Torresola moved to New York City in August 1948 to gain work. He was employed by a New York stationery and perfume store. Affected by a separation from his first wife, he lost his job. A member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Torresola joined the New York City chapter of the party, where he met fellow Nationalist Oscar Collazo.

He lived with his new love Carmen Dolores Otero, who was pregnant with their second child, and their young daughter Rebecca, on a welfare check of $125 a month.

==Jayuya Uprising==
Nationalists had been angered by what they viewed as great injustices during previous decades, including the Ponce massacre (1937), the extrajudicial murders of some members, and the jailing of Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Nationalist Party, for his advocacy of violent resistance. They felt the impending changes of Puerto Rico&#x27;s status from a non-autonomous territory to a partially self-governing commonwealth were a continuation of United States imperialism. They viewed Puerto Rico as a colony demanding independence from the United States.

On October 30, 1950, Torresola&#x27;s brother and sister participated in the Jayuya Uprising, part of insurgent efforts across Puerto Rico by Nationalists. They attacked police headquarters and other facilities. The island government declared martial law and attacked the town with U.S. P-47 Thunderbolt fighter planes, land-based artillery, mortar fire, grenades, and the Puerto Rican National Guard. The planes machine-gunned nearly every rooftop in the town. The Nationalists held the town for two days; after they were overcome, the government made mass arrests. In New York City, Torresola was angered by the situation. He later learned that an extensive part of his hometown was destroyed, but the scale of military response was not reported outside of Puerto Rico. The American media reported President Truman as saying it was an &quot;incident between Puerto Ricans.&quot; Torresola learned that his sister was wounded and his brother arrested in the uprising.

== Assassination attempt ==

Together Torresola and Collazo decided they needed to act quickly to bring the cause of independence to world attention. Having learned that President Truman was living at Blair House while the White House was being renovated, they thought security would be less. They decided to assassinate him to gain publicity for their cause. 

The two men took the train from New York south to Washington, DC. On November 1, 1950, they approached Blair House. Torresola walked up Pennsylvania Avenue from the west side while his partner, Oscar Collazo, engaged Secret Service special agents and White House policemen from the east. Torresola approached a guard booth at the west corner of the Blair house, and noted an officer, sitting inside. Torresola quickly fired four shots from his 9 mm German Luger, semi-automatic pistol at close range at the officer, who was Leslie Coffelt, before he could react. Three of the shots struck Coffelt in the chest and abdomen, and the fourth went through his policeman&#x27;s tunic. Coffelt slumped down in his chair, mortally wounded.

Torresola saw that a plainclothes White House policeman named Joseph Downs had turned back toward him. Torresola shot him in the hip before he could draw his weapon, and twice more. Wounded, Downs escaped through the basement door and locked it to prevent Torresola from entering. Torresola then turned his attention to a firefight between Collazo and several law enforcement officers. Torresola shot District of Columbia policeman Donald Birdzell in the left knee from a distance of approximately 40 feet, incapacitating him and preventing him from shooting Collazo.

Standing to the left of the Blair House steps as he reloaded, Torresola was only 30 feet from President Truman, who had been awakened by the gunfire and looked outside. Agents yelled at him to get away from the window. The dying officer Coffelt struggled outside the guard booth and shot Torresola in the head. Coffelt&#x27;s bullet went through Torresola&#x27;s head and blew out a portion of his brain, killing him instantly.

Coffelt died of his three bullet wounds several hours later. The overall gunfight lasted less than 40 seconds. Torresola was survived by his wife and two children. He was buried at the Jayuya Municipal Cemetery in Jayuya, Puerto Rico.

==Aftermath==
Oscar Collazo survived his wounds despite being shot multiple times by the officers, was convicted at trial of murder, and sentenced to death. President Truman commuted his sentence to life. After serving 27 years in Leavenworth Federal Prison in Kansas, Collazo had his sentence commuted to time served by President Jimmy Carter. Collazo was released in 1979 and soon returned to Puerto Rico where he continued to support the independence movement. He died in 1994 at age 80. Collazo is quoted as saying, &quot;It would not be justice to Griselio if we merely remembered him for his ability with weapons. We must remember the brave and expert guerrilla of the mountains of Jayuya as the patriot who never had doubts when his country called him to completion of his duty.&quot;

<doc id="1181559" wikidata="Q6688761" url="?curid=1181559" title="Louise Goffin">
<text>Louise Goffin (born March 23, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter and producer of the 2011 album &quot;A Holiday Carole&quot;. Signed by record executive Lenny Waronker to DreamWorks in 1999, Goffin released &quot;Sometimes a Circle&quot; in 2002. She went on to release five albums, an EP, and several singles independently through her own label Majority of One Records, which was launched May 2008. She teaches songwriting to teen girls from disadvantaged backgrounds in partnership with the charitable organization WriteGirl.

== Early life ==
Goffin&#x27;s parents are songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin. At the age of 14 she and her sister, Sherry, provided vocals for the song &quot;Nightingale&quot;, on her mother Carole King&#x27;s album &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot;, which was released in 1974. She also sang backing vocals on Carole King&#x27;s 1975 release &quot;Really Rosie&quot; and her 1977 release &quot;Simple Things&quot;. At Los Angeles&#x27; University High School&#x27;s Interdisciplinary Program School (1975), she used the name Lakshme.

== Career as recording artist ==
Goffin&#x27;s debut public performance was opening for Jackson Browne at the Troubadour when she was 17 years old. Her debut album &quot;Kid Blue,&quot; produced by Danny Kortchmar, was released on Elektra Records in 1979.
Goffin was the youngest artist on the soundtrack to &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. She lived in England in 1984–1994 and made two records while signed to WEA. &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, released in 1988, included the VH1 video hit &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot;. The following UK album was recorded 1990–1 at Astoria Studios, a houseboat, built in 1911 for and once owned by impresario Fred Karno, now a recording studio owned by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. The rare UK Eastwest Records recordings include a version of the U2 song &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot;, with additional lyrics by Bono.

In 2002 Goffin released the album &quot;Sometimes a Circle&quot;, produced by Greg Wells through the DreamWorks label.

In 2008, Goffin launched her own label Majority Of One Records to put out her first independent release, the eight-song &quot;Bad Little Animals&quot;. She has continued to release her recordings through Majority Of One, including &quot;Songs From The Mine&quot;, which features backing vocals from Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp on &quot;Watching The Sky Turn Blue&quot;; &quot;Appleonfire&quot;, a tribute EP to her late father; &quot;The Essential Louise Goffin, Vol. 1&quot;, combining highlights from her previous three records with new recordings; and many singles. Her album &quot;All These Hellos&quot;, co-produced with Dave Way and featuring performances by Chris Difford from Squeeze, Rufus Wainwright, Van Dyke Parks and Billy Harvey, was released in fall 2018. Her subsequent album &quot;Two Different Movies,&quot; released in 2020, was also co-produced by Dave Way and featured contributions from Billy Harvey, Van Dyke Parks, Benmont Tench, and Greg Leisz. The album cover art is a sketch of Louise drawn by Joni Mitchell.

Goffin sang on the theme song for the TV show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, dueting with her mother on King&#x27;s song &quot;Where You Lead&quot;. Goffin didn&#x27;t realize how popular the show was until many years later, but embraced its impact and appeared at the Gilmore Girls Fan Fest.

== Other work ==
Goffin produced Carole King&#x27;s first holiday record &quot;A Holiday Carole&quot;. Goffin co-wrote all three original songs &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Christmas Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Christmas In The Air&quot;. There is a jazz arrangement of a classic Chanukah prayer, co-arranged with musician and horn player Lee Curreri. The album was nominated for a Grammy.

Goffin has played with other known musicians as a side-woman. She appeared playing banjo with Bryan Ferry in his video &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;. She went on to play guitar on tour with Tears for Fears in 1997.

Goffin leads songwriting masterclasses and mentors teen girls in songwriting in partnership with the organization WriteGirl.

In 2018, she and co-host Paul Zollo launched the podcast &quot;The Great Song Adventure&quot;, where they interview notable songwriters and other music industry influencers.

In 2020, Goffin launched her own songwriter interview podcast called &quot;Song Chronicles.&quot;

Goffin is the creative director of The Goffin &amp; King Foundation, which seeks to preserve her parents&#x27; legacy through empowering rising songwriters with educational opportunities.

<doc id="1181564" wikidata="Q4671147" url="?curid=1181564" title="Academic Performance Index (California public schools)">
<text>The Academic Performance Index (API) was a measurement of academic performance and progress of individual schools in California, United States. The API was one of the main components of the Public Schools Accountability Act passed by the California State Legislature in 1999. It was last updated for the 2012–2013 school year, and on March 15, 2017, the California State Board of Education and the California Department of Education launched a new accountability system to replace the Academic Performance Index to better measure California&#x27;s education goals. The replacement reporting interface is the California School Dashboard.

==API scores==

===Numeric Index===
A numeric API score ranged from a low of 200 to a high of 1000. The interim statewide API performance target for all schools was 800. A school&#x27;s growth was measured by how well it was moving toward or past that goal.

An API score was calculated for all students in a school as well as numerous API scores for each subgroup at the school (such as by race, English Learner Status, students with disabilities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged pupils).

===Rankings===
The API Statewide Rank score ranked a school with all schools in California based on API score, while the API Similar Schools score ranked a school with 100 other schools in the state with similar demographic profiles (including parent education level, poverty level, student mobility, student ethnicity).

Each rank ranged from 1 to 10, with a score of 10 meaning that the school&#x27;s API fell into the top 10%.

==Indicator of performance==
A school&#x27;s score or placement on the API was designed to be an indicator of a school&#x27;s performance level and was calculated annually by the California Department of Education, primarily based on CST and CAHSEE tests.

Due to the API&#x27;s heavy reliance on standardized testing (although some factors such as attendance and graduation rates were considered), many criticisms of standardized testing could also be leveled at the reliability and accuracy of API scores as an indicator of a school&#x27;s level of &quot;academic achievement.&quot;

== Accountability==
The API was closely tied to monetary and incentive awards by setting Annual Percent Growth Targets for each school and whether the school met or exceeded this goal. The Public Schools Accountability Act also established The Immediate Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program and the Governor&#x27;s High Achieving/Improving Schools Program.

In addition, the API was used to determine Adequate Yearly Progress as a part of the No Child Left Behind Act.

<text>Eleanor Atwood Arnason (born December 28, 1942) is an American author of science fiction novels and short stories.

Arnason&#x27;s earliest published story, &quot;A Clear Day in the Motor City&quot;, appeared in &quot;New Worlds&quot; in 1973. Her work often depicts cultural change and conflict, usually from the viewpoint of characters who cannot or will not live by their own societies&#x27; rules. This anthropological focus has led many to compare her fiction to that of Ursula K. Le Guin.

Arnason won the inaugural James Tiptree Jr. Award in 1991 and the 1992 Mythopoeic Award for &quot;A Woman of the Iron People&quot; and in 2000 won the Gaylactic Spectrum Award for Best Short Fiction for &quot;Dapple&quot; and the HOMer Award for her novelette &quot;Stellar Harvest&quot;. &quot;Stellar Harvest&quot; was also nominated for a Hugo Award in 2000. In 2003, she was nominated for two Nebula Awards for her novella &quot;Potter of Bones&quot; and her short story &quot;Knapsack Poems&quot;. In 2004, she was guest of honor at Wiscon. She lives in Minnesota.

==Background==

Eleanor Arnason is the daughter of H. Harvard Arnason, a Canadian-born man of Icelandic descent, who worked as an art historian and became the director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1951, and Elizabeth Hickcox Yard Arnason, a social worker by profession who spent her childhood in a missionary community in western China. Arnason is the niece of the American feminist Molly Yard and her maternal grandparents were both Methodist missionaries. This Methodist influence would be visible in her works, most notably in &quot;Ring of Swords&quot;.

From 1949 to 1960, Arnason and her parents lived in Walker&#x27;s &quot;Idea House #2&quot;, a futuristic dwelling built next to the Walker Art Center. Arnason has said that her experience growing up around avant-garde artists in a futurist house, in addition to the influence of her feminist, socialist mother contributed to her preoccupation with the future, and consequently science fiction. Prior to 1949, Arnason&#x27;s family moved frequently: from New York City to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; London; Paris; and St. Paul, Minnesota.

She graduated from Swarthmore College in 1964, with a B.A. in art history, and continued her education in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, until 1967. She spent the next seven years working as an office clerk in Brooklyn and then Detroit. Her time in these blue-collar, racially diverse areas helped to shape her understanding about class consciousness, conflict, and revolution—notions that are reflected in her works. Arnason moved back to Minneapolis–Saint Paul in 1974 and continued to work in offices, warehouses, a large art museum, and more recently, a series of small nonprofits devoted to history, peace, justice, and art.

Since 1994, she has shifted her literary focus from novels to short fiction. She retired in 2009 and now writes full-time.

==Politics==

The issues that transpire most in Arnason&#x27;s life and writings encompass feminism, peace, social justice, support for the union movement and a deep belief that racism and all forms of prejudice should be opposed. &quot;City Pages&quot; labelled Arnason as a political radical.

Having come of age during Second-wave feminism, Arnason included gender and sexuality as central themes in her work, notably in her collection of stories, in which she &quot;wanted to create a society in which homosexual love was normal and heterosexual love was abnormal, sort of as a thought experiment. And because contemporary Americans have very rigid ideas of what is normal.&quot; The stories also addressed issues of gender roles and reproductive rights.

She was profoundly affected by the McCarthy period, particularly because of the ways that children were taught to securitize against nuclear annihilation. She became involved in the Student Peace Union and attended demonstrations during the Cuban Missile Crisis. &quot;Ring of Swords&quot;, Arnason&#x27;s novel, illustrates peacebuilding after a long war; an endeavor both representative of Arnason&#x27;s peace beliefs and of the make love, not war politics of the 1960s.

In 1963, Arnason went to the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom with her mother. This had a profound impact that would be reflected in her story &quot;Big Brown Mama and Brer Rabbit&quot; in which Brer Rabbit transforms into an African-American man in the early 20th century. Arnason has often opted for racially diverse characters, including, but not limited to, a heroine of Chinese descent in &quot;A Woman of the Iron People&quot; and a Hispanic heroine in Ring of Swords. In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.

Arnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the National Writers Union and engaging in Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party precinct politics.

<doc id="1181584" wikidata="Q248283" url="?curid=1181584" title="Metal Hammer">
<text>Metal Hammer is a heavy metal music magazine and website founded in 1983, published in the United Kingdom by Future, with other language editions published by different companies available in numerous other countries. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; features news, reviews and long-form articles covering both major and underground bands in heavy metal, as well as covering rock, punk, grunge and other alternative music genres.

==Publication history==
Wilfried F. Rimensberger conceived &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in 1983, taking the idea of a rock magazine publishing in different languages to Jürgen Wigginghaus, publisher of the German magazine &quot;MusikSzene&quot;, where Rimensberger was chief editor. Wigginghaus helped launch the German edition of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; soon after, while Rimensberger launched the flagship, English language version from London in November 1986, installing Harry Doherty, formerly of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, as editor. The magazine would grow to be published in 11 different languages around the world, including local language editions in Israel, Japan, Serbia, Spain, The Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Hungary and France, also becoming the first Western youth publication in the Soviet Union.

&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; UK changed owners several times between the early 90s and late 2010s. It was bought by Dennis Publishing in 1994, where it remained for six years before being sold to Future in 2000. In 2013, start-up publisher TeamRock bought the magazine alongside sister titles &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Prog&quot;, before Future bought all three brands back following the collapse of TeamRock in December 2016.

In 2018, Future renamed the Teamrock.com website as &quot;Louder&quot;, a continuation of the &#x27;parent brand&#x27; model for &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Prog&quot; that would house all three magazines&#x27; respective websites.

&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; Germany was sold separately to Axel Springer SE in 1999.

== Brand extensions ==
=== Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards ===

The Golden Gods Awards were established in 2003 by then-editor Chris Ingham, designed to commemorate the biggest and most exciting names in heavy metal. The annual ceremony, featuring band performances in front of a live crowd, took place from 2003-2018. Over the course of 15 years, the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Motörhead, Slipknot, Tony Iommi, Brian May, Dave Mustaine, Rob Zombie, Bill Bailey, Chris Jericho and more either performed or appeared at the awards.

=== Podcasts and radio shows ===
&quot;The Metal Hammer Podcast&quot; was launched in 2009, originally presented by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; staff members James Gill and Terry Bezer and covering weekly news and events from the world of metal, as well as reviews of new albums from prominent artists. It&#x27;d go on to be presented by Merlin Alderslade, Stephen Hill and Amit Sharma, before being put on hold in 2013 as &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; launched &quot;The Metal Hammer Radio Show&quot; on TeamRock&#x27;s newly founded digital radio station. The radio show continued until 2018, when it was taken off air.

In 2016, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; launched a limited &quot;...In Residence&quot; series in partnership with Spotify, presented by Alderslade, Luke Morton and then-&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; editor-in-chief, Alexander Milas. The show produced six episodes featuring exclusive interviews with major metal artists, including Iron Maiden and Bring Me The Horizon.

After a five-year hiatus, &quot;The Metal Hammer Podcast&quot; returned in 2018, hosted by Alderslade, Morton and Eleanor Goodman, staying on air for four more years before going back on hiatus in 2022.

=== Magazines in other territories ===
There are independently owned Greek and Italian &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; publications, while Portuguese and Japanese (licensed from the &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; UK/Future) editions of the publication were launched in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

In Germany, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; is still published by Axel Springer SE.

<doc id="1181585" wikidata="Q3111767" url="?curid=1181585" title="Troy Percival">
<text>Troy Eugene Percival (born August 9, 1969) is an American baseball coach and former professional baseball pitcher. He gained fame as a closer. He is currently the manager of the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer League. During a 14-year baseball career spanning from 1995 to 2009, he pitched for four Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, primarily with the California/Anaheim Angels. He was an integral part of that franchise&#x27;s 2002 World Series championship team.

==Early career==
Percival started playing baseball at Moreno Valley Youth Federation (MVYF). Percival played on the Moreno Valley High School baseball team, before attending the University of California, Riverside, where he played college baseball for the Highlanders from 1987–1990. He was then drafted by the California Angels in the 6th round of the 1990 amateur draft as a catcher. He batted .203 in his only season as a catcher with the Boise Hawks and was converted to a pitcher when coaches noticed that his return throws to the mound were actually faster than the pitches he caught. He made his Major League debut as a reliever in , and was mostly used as a setup man for Lee Smith. He was coached by his father Richard Percival for all of his childhood years.

==Closer career==
In , he became the regular closer for the Angels and had 36 saves with 100 strikeouts in 74 innings. He is one of only six pitchers in the Angels&#x27; 44-year history to strike out at least 100 batters in a season without starting a game. The others are Mark Clear (105, ), DeWayne Buice (109, ), Bryan Harvey (101, ) Scot Shields (109, ) and Francisco Rodríguez (123, 2004).

He had a career-high 42 saves in , and enjoyed his best season in with a 4–1 record, 40 saves, 68 strikeouts, and a 1.92 ERA. That year en route to winning the World Series, he was 7 for 7 in save opportunities, tying John Wetteland for most saves in one postseason (since tied by Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 but blew one on the eighth opportunity).

A four-time All-Star, Percival compiled a 29–38 record with a 2.99 ERA in 586.2 innings for the Angels. His 355 saves grant him inclusion in the 300 save club. However, his strikeouts per nine innings went down considerably after his years as an elite closer. In , his K/9 rate was 11.08 and decreased to 5.98 in 2004. His fastball, once clocked consistently at 96–100 MPH, was down to about 92–93 MPH in 2004, due to a degenerative hip condition that first appeared in 2003, which forced him to alter his pitching delivery.

Percival&#x27;s contract with the Angels expired in 2004 and he became a free agent at the end of that season. Rather than bring Percival back, the Angels decided to turn to young phenom Francisco Rodríguez to close, motivated largely by Rodríguez&#x27;s much lower price tag and concerns about Percival&#x27;s age and health. The Angels offered to negotiate a reduced role (at a correspondingly reduced salary) for Percival to return as a setup man, but Percival decided to seek opportunities elsewhere that would allow him to remain a closer.

==Later career and retirement==
Percival signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent for the season. However, after a mediocre start to his career at Comerica Park, during which he converted eight saves from 11 opportunities and posted an ERA of 5.76, Percival suffered a serious injury to his right forearm in early July. The severity of the injury ended his season, and put the rest of his career in doubt.

After attempting to recuperate, Percival reported to spring training for the Tigers in . However, on his first outing he again suffered significant pain and left the team. After spending the entire 2006 season on the Tigers&#x27; disabled list and working for the team as an advance scout, Percival&#x27;s contract with the Tigers expired at the end of the 2006 season.

Though he didn&#x27;t pitch a game during the Tigers&#x27; run to the American League Championship, the team voted Percival a ring and a full playoff share. Appreciative of this gesture, he used the money to buy a suite at Comerica Park for his teammates&#x27; wives.

In November and December 2006, during his time off from baseball, Percival funded and personally built a new clubhouse at the Riverside Sports Complex, the home venue of his college baseball program, UC Riverside.

==Comeback and second retirement==

On January 19, , the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim hired Percival as a special assignment pitching instructor. However, believing his arm to have finally healed, he requested his release from his minor league coaching contract to pursue a comeback. Percival signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and joined the big league team on June 26, 2007. Percival was the fourth member of the 2002 championship Angels team to play for the 2007 Cardinals, joining David Eckstein, Scott Spiezio, and Adam Kennedy, as well as former Angels teammate Jim Edmonds.

Percival made his first appearance in the Majors since 2005 on June 29, 2007, against the Cincinnati Reds. He struck out the first batter he faced, David Ross, and was also credited with the win.

On November 29, 2007, he signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. The contract contained up to $4 million in performance-based incentives. Percival was the team&#x27;s primary closer in .

On May 22, 2009, a day after allowing two runs in 1/3 of an inning against the Oakland Athletics, Percival was placed on Tampa Bay&#x27;s disabled list. On August 11, 2009, he announced that he was likely to retire, and would cease his attempts at coming back from his injury.

==Coaching career==
From 2010 to 2012, Percival was a volunteer pitching coach at Riverside Polytechnic High School. On September 24, 2012, Percival was hired as head varsity baseball coach at his alma mater, Moreno Valley High School. On July 26, 2014, he was named head coach of the UC Riverside baseball team. On November 11, 2020, Percival resigned as head coach of the Highlanders, citing the desire to help his son through the professional ranks as his reason for resignation.

On January 12, 2024, Percival was announced as the manager of the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer League.

==Head coaching record==




==Personal life==
Percival&#x27;s son, Cole, was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 31st round of the 2017 MLB Draft.

<text>The Terak 8510/a was a graphical desktop workstation developed by the Terak Corporation in 1977. It was among the first desktop personal computers with a bitmap graphics display. It was a desktop workstation with an LSI-11 compatible processor, a graphical framebuffer, and a text mode with downloadable fonts. The combined weight of processor, display, and keyboard was approximately 50lb. Despite the lack of an MMU, it was capable of running a stripped version of UNIX version 6. It was the first personal machine on which the UCSD p-System was widely used. Various universities in the USA used it in the late 1970s through mid-1980s to teach Pascal programming. It provided immediate graphic feedback from simple programs encouraging students to learn. 

Three entrepreneurs started the Terak Corporation in 1975: Brian Benzar, William Mayberry and Dennis Kodimer. Terak products were manufactured in Scottsdale, Arizona from 1976 thru 1984. Sales reached $10M and Terak was publicly traded in 1983-84. Besides the original frame-buffer-centric 8510/a, other products were developed: color graphics and a Unix workstation. A Terak computer was on display at the Boston Museum of Science and also the Jefferson Computer Museum.

<doc id="1181595" wikidata="Q217021" url="?curid=1181595" title="Live aus Berlin">
<text>Live aus Berlin (, &quot;Live from Berlin&quot;) is a recording of a concert by the German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, performed in 1998 and released a year later. The release contains live performances of nearly every song from the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; (9 out of 11 songs, omitting &quot;Der Meister&quot; and &quot;Das Alte Leid&quot;), and most of the songs from their second album, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; (8 out of 11 songs, omitting &quot;Alter Mann&quot;, &quot;Eifersucht&quot;, and &quot;Küss Mich (Fellfrosch)&quot;). It also includes a full-band rendition of the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; b-side &quot;Wilder Wein&quot;.

The album has been released in several formats:

* CD (15 tracks)
* 2 CD Limited Edition (18 tracks + multimedia content)
* Censored VHS/DVD (without &quot;Bück dich&quot;)
* Uncensored VHS (with &quot;Bück dich&quot;)
* Uncensored DVD (released in 2020)
The performance of &quot;Bück dich&quot; (&quot;Bend down&quot;, &quot;Bend over&quot;) is controversial. The mimed portrayal of anal sex using a water-squirting dildo led to the video being given an 18 certificate in Europe. The first DVD release of the concert does not include the performance, although it is included on the uncensored version of the VHS and CD releases and the 2020 reissue of the DVD.

==Track listing==

* Audio cassette version is available (Side A = 1-8; B = 9-15)
* Some editions contains a hidden track in the pregap, rewind about 58 seconds before track 1.

===Limited edition===

===Video===

*The DVD version also contains a subtitled 1997 interview, with the band&#x27;s members, discussing Rammstein in general, and a multi-angle area featuring &quot;Tier&quot;, &quot;Du hast&quot;, and &quot;Rammstein&quot;. There is also a 2-stage quiz accessible through PCs.

===Easter eggs===
*When accessing the number pad feature at the menu of the original DVD and entering &#x27;23&#x27; anywhere in the main menu, the music video Stripped will play. The song is a cover of the Depeche Mode song and is also featured as a bonus track on Rammstein&#x27;s second album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;.
*After winning the second part of the quiz, a weblink and secret password is given in order to download a Rammstein screensaver. The webpage is no longer available.

<text>Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Stanley Magnuski is an American engineer and was the co-founder and CEO of GammaLink, an early pioneer in PC-to-fax technology. He also founded Internet Video Services, a video service provider; MediaMart, an electronic commerce site; and NCast, a presentation technology company.

Magnuski graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a BSEE in Electrical Engineering in 1965, and an MSEE from MIT in 1966. He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from MIT and conducted postdoctoral work at Stanford University.

In 1995, Magnuski received the Fax Industry Award from BIS, now Giga Information Group, Inc. 

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Illinois, in 1998, recognized Magnuski as a Distinguished Alumni &quot;In recognition of outstanding contributions to the telecommunications industry, including pioneering work in the area of PC-fax Technology.&quot;

In 1980 Magnuski established the first packet repeater for amateur radio in the US. This repeater, KA6M/R, located in the San Francisco Bay area, created interest in packet radio technology and led to the establishment of the Pacific Packet Radio Society.

Magnuski and his wife, Cynthia Jose, established the &quot;Henry Magnuski Endowed Professorship&quot; at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois in honor of his father, Henryk Magnuski.

A patent in multicast videoconferencing was granted to Magnuski in 2007.

<text>JBL is an American audio equipment manufacturer headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The company was founded in 1946 by James Bullough Lansing, an American audio engineer and loudspeaker designer. JBL currently serves the home and professional audio markets. Their professional products include live PA systems, studio monitors, and loudspeakers for cinema. Their home products include home audio speakers, waterproof Bluetooth speakers, and high-end car audio. JBL is owned by Harman International, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics.

==History==
James Bullough Lansing and his business partner Ken Decker started a company in 1927 in Los Angeles, manufacturing speaker drivers for radio consoles and radio sets. The firm was named &quot;Lansing Manufacturing Company&quot;, from March 1, 1927.

In 1933, head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) sound department, Douglas Shearer, dissatisfied with the loudspeakers of Western Electric and RCA, decided to develop his own. John Hilliard, Robert Stephens, and John F. Blackburn were part of the team that developed the Shearer Horn, with Lansing Manufacturing producing the 285 compression driver and the 15XS bass driver. The Shearer Horn gave the desired improvements and Western Electric and RCA received the contracts to each build 75 units. Western Electric named them &quot;Diaphonics&quot;, and RCA used them in their RCA Photophones. Lansing Manufacturing was the only firm selling them as Shearer Horns. In 1936, the Shearer Horn received the Academy Scientific and Technical Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Based on the experience developed with the Shearer Horn, Lansing produced the Iconic System loudspeaker for cinemas. The Iconic was a two-way speaker using a woofer for the low frequencies and a compression driver for the highs.

In 1939, Decker was killed in an airplane crash. The company soon began having financial troubles. In 1941, Lansing Manufacturing Company was bought by Altec Service Corporation, after which the name changed to &quot;Altec Lansing.&quot; After Lansing&#x27;s contract expired in 1946, he left Altec Lansing and founded Lansing Sound, which later changed to &quot;James B. Lansing Sound&quot; and was further shortened to &quot;JBL Sound.&quot;

In 1946, JBL produced their first products, the model D101 15-inch loudspeaker and the model D175 high-frequency driver. The D175 remained in the JBL catalog through the 1970s. Both of these were near-copies of Altec Lansing products. The first original product was the D130, a 15-inch transducer for which a variant remained in production for the next 55 years. The D130 featured a flat ribbon wire voice coil and Alnico V magnet. Two other products were the D131 and the D208 cone drivers.

The Marquardt Corporation gave the company early manufacturing space and a modest investment. William H. Thomas, the treasurer of Marquardt Corporation, represented Marquardt on Lansing&#x27;s board of directors. In 1948, Marquardt took over the operation of JBL. In 1949, Marquardt was purchased by General Tire Company. The new company, not interested in the loudspeaker business, severed ties with Lansing. Lansing was reincorporated as James B. Lansing and moved the newly formed company to its first private location, on 2439 Fletcher Drive, Los Angeles.

A key to JBL&#x27;s early development was Lansing&#x27;s close business relationship with its primary supplier of Alnico V magnetic material, Robert Arnold of Arnold Engineering. Arnold saw JBL as an opportunity to sell Alnico V magnetic materials into a new market.

Lansing was noted as an innovative engineer but a poor businessman. Decker, his business partner, had died in 1939 in an airplane crash. In the late 1940s, Lansing struggled to pay invoices and ship products. Possibly as a result of deteriorating business conditions and personal issues, he committed suicide on September 4, 1949. The company then passed into the hands of Bill Thomas, JBL&#x27;s vice president. Lansing had taken out a life insurance policy, naming the company as the beneficiary, a decision that allowed Thomas to continue the company after Lansing&#x27;s death. Soon after, Thomas purchased Mrs. Lansing&#x27;s one-third interest in the company and became the sole owner. Thomas is credited with revitalizing the company and spearheading a period of strong growth for the two decades following the founding of JBL.

Early products included the model 375 high-frequency driver and the 075 ultra-high frequency (UHF) ring-radiator driver. The ring-radiator drivers are also known as &quot;JBL bullets&quot; because of their distinctive shape. The 375 was a re-invention of the Western Electric 594 driver but with an Alnico V magnet and a four-inch voice coil. The 375 shared the same basic magnet structure as the D-130 woofer. JBL engineers Ed May and Bart N. Locanthi created these designs.

Two products from that era, the Hartsfield and the Paragon, continue to be highly desired on the collectors&#x27; market.

In 1955, the brand name JBL was introduced to resolve ongoing disputes with Altec Lansing Corporation. The company name, &quot;James B. Lansing Sound, Incorporated,&quot; was retained, but the logo name was changed to JBL with its distinctive exclamation point.

The JBL 4320 series studio monitor was introduced through Capitol Records in Hollywood and became the standard monitor worldwide for its parent company, EMI. JBL&#x27;s introduction to rock and roll music came via the adoption of the D130 loudspeaker by Leo Fender&#x27;s Fender Guitar Company as the ideal driver for electric guitars.

In 1969, Thomas sold JBL to the Jervis Corporation (later renamed &quot;Harman International&quot;), headed by Sidney Harman. The 1970s saw JBL become a household brand, starting with the famous L-100, which was the bestselling loudspeaker model of any company at that time. The 1970s were also a time of major JBL expansion in the professional audio field from their studio monitors. By 1977, more recording studios were using JBL monitors than all other brands combined, according to a &quot;Billboard&quot; survey. The JBL L-100 and 4310 control monitors were popular home speakers. In the late 1970s, the new L-series designs L15, L26, L46, L56, L86, L96, L112, L150, and later the L150A and flagship L250 were introduced with improved crossovers, ceramic magnet woofers, updated midrange drivers, and aluminum-deposition phenolic resin tweeters. In the mid-1980s, the designs were again updated and redesigned with a new titanium-deposition tweeter diaphragm. The new L-series designations being the L20T, L40T, L60T, L80T, L100T, the Ti-series 18Ti, 120Ti, 240Ti, and the flagship 250Ti. To test speaker drivers, JBL in Glendale and Northridge used the roof as an outdoor equivalent to an anechoic chamber.

Over the next two decades, JBL went more mass-market with their consumer (Northridge) line of loudspeakers. At the same time, they made an entry into the high-end market with their project speakers, consisting of the Everest and K2 lines. JBL became a prominent supplier to the tour sound industry, their loudspeakers being employed by touring rock acts and music festivals. JBL products were the basis for the development of THX loudspeaker standard, which resulted in JBL becoming a popular cinema loudspeaker manufacturer.

<doc id="1181621" wikidata="Q5898705" url="?curid=1181621" title="Hooterville">
<text>Hooterville is a fictional agricultural community that is the setting for the American situation comedies &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; (1963–70) and &quot;Green Acres&quot; (1965–1971), two rural-oriented television series created or produced by Paul Henning for Filmways and CBS. 

==Description==
Prior to the airing of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, Hooterville is mentioned in an early episode in the first season of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, another Paul Henning sitcom. In this episode, Jethrine Bodine, Jethro Bodine&#x27;s sister (also played by Max Baer, Jr.), has a budding romance with a slick traveling salesman, Jasper, who invites her to a dance in Hooterville. Hooterville is a town, a valley, and a county, and has been described as &quot;a place simultaneously Southern and Midwestern, but in a vague sort of way&quot;. Little concrete or reliable information can be gleaned from the two shows about the place, as references in individual episodes are rife with inconsistencies, contradictions, geographic impossibilities and continuity errors. The writers of the two shows often changed the details about the Hooterville community at will for the purpose of cracking a joke, and they left certain details (such as its home state) intentionally vague and unexplained.

==Citizens==
The known citizens of Hooterville include:

* Oliver Wendell Douglas and Lisa Douglas - The new residents from New York City.
* Eb Dawson - The Douglas&#x27; farmhand.
* Newt Kiley - A farmer who farms over 80 acres (32 ha).
* Ben Miller - An apple farmer.
* Mr. Haney (first name disputed, Eustace or Charlton) - The county antiques dealer and grifter.
* Hank Kimball - The dimwitted repetitiously conversational county agent.
* Sam Drucker - The proprietor of Sam Drucker&#x27;s General Store.
* Sarah Hotchkiss Trendell - The telephone operator.
* Alf and Ralph Monroe - Two siblings who work as carpenters. Despite Ralph&#x27;s name and status as a brother, Ralph is a woman. Only Oliver Wendell Douglas questions the bizarre contradiction.
* Fred Ziffel - A pig farmer.
* Doris &quot;Ruthie&quot; Ziffel - Fred&#x27;s shrewish wife.
* Arnold Ziffel - Fred and Doris&#x27;s porcine &quot;son&quot;.
* Charley Pratt and Floyd Smoot - The engineer and conductor, respectively, of the local train, the &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot;.

Kate Bradley, her Uncle Joe Carson, and her three daughters Betty Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Billie Jo reside at the Shady Rest Hotel which is 25 miles outside of Hooterville.

The citizens of Hooterville are out of touch with the times to the point of thinking that Calvin Coolidge is still President, although they later believe the current President to be Coolidge&#x27;s successor Herbert Hoover. They are also quite provincial: they have never heard of the Federal income tax or tax refunds.

==Known locations==
===Drucker&#x27;s Store===
Sam Drucker is the proprietor of Hooterville&#x27;s general store. It is the kind of old-fashioned store where the grocer retrieves many of the items from shelves behind the counter. Drucker sells typical food and household goods, and at times sells such oddities as nail polish that&#x27;s also a bathtub sealant, as well as dehydrated chickens: &quot;Just add water and bones, and let it sit for a couple hours.&quot; He also keeps a pickle barrel full of plastic pickles. Customers are allowed to shop on credit, although Drucker frequently (and exasperatedly) reminds them of their outstanding bills. Drucker&#x27;s Store is the closest thing Hooterville has to a social club. The locals often come in to chit-chat, or to play checkers, or to rant and rave about community issues. And, on election day, they cast their votes at Drucker&#x27;s. Exterior shots of the store show a sign that says &quot;Sam Drucker&#x27;s General Store&quot;, but everyone (including Sam Drucker) mostly calls the store either &quot;Drucker&#x27;s Store&quot; or just &quot;Drucker&#x27;s&quot;.

====Post office====
The Hooterville post office is located in Drucker&#x27;s Store. One of Sam Drucker&#x27;s quirks is that he insists on putting on his official postal worker hat and standing behind a small regulation post office grille next to the register whenever his role switches from storekeeper to postmaster. Drucker takes great pride in his association with the Post Office Department, and he&#x27;s also very pleased that his patrons must come to his store to get their mail. In the 1960s, rural post offices were often located in stores, and some still exist even today. The &quot;Green Acres&quot; fourth-season episode &quot;Old Mail Day&quot; is about the day when Sam Drucker cleans his store and Hootervillians gather to receive the lost old mail that he finds. A lost letter from 1917 informs Fred Ziffel that he has been drafted into the army to fight in World War I. There is no Rural Free Delivery (RFD) in Hooterville; when new resident Oliver Douglas petitions his Congressman for it to be initiated, Drucker is shocked to learn that an obscure (and fictitious) postal regulation requires him to carry the entire route himself— by bicycle. (This situation is, obviously, soon corrected.) In the 1990 made-for-television film &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;, actor Frank Cady in character as Sam Drucker states that the Hooterville ZIP Code is 40516½; the real-life ZIP codes 40516 and 40517 are used by the city of Lexington, Kentucky.

===Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department===
The volunteer fire department is run by Fire Chief &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Carson. The firefighters include Joe, Sam Drucker, Ralph and Alf Monroe, Mr. Haney and an assortment of other Hootervillians. Joe is also the conductor of the Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department Band, which is a brass ensemble marching band that includes Charley Pratt (trumpet), Floyd Smoot (tuba), Ben Miller (French horn), Grandpa Miller (cymbals), and Sam Drucker (bass drum). The only song the band ever plays is &quot;Hot Time In The Old Town Tonight&quot;, and no matter how many times they rehearse it, they always play the song at half-speed and somewhat off-key. In the &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Raise My Husband to be a Fireman&quot;, Oliver Douglas learns that a person has to be able to play an instrument in order to join the fire department. Joe Carson says this is because Hooterville has more parades than fires. Indeed, the Fire Department Band is seen more often on the shows than actual fire emergencies. The band actually pre-dates the fire department; it was used in fundraisers to help establish the department.

===Tourist attractions and events===
The local tourist attractions and events seen and referred to on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot; give a (sometimes humorous) picture of old-fashioned small-town life:

* Newt Kiley&#x27;s two-headed rooster (before it died)
* Mr. Haney&#x27;s monkey racing track
* The Shady Rest Hotel&#x27;s annual Horseshoe Tournament
* Kate Bradley&#x27;s annual Shady Rest Jamboree
* The Hooterville Centennial Celebration (1968)
* Old Mail Day at Drucker&#x27;s Store
* The Spring Festival
* The annual Hooterville Founders&#x27; Day Celebration
* The Hooterville County Fair

&quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; (1963–1970) is based on the Burris Hotel, a real hotel that existed in Eldon, Missouri. Paul Henning, the producer and creator of the show, was married to the granddaughter of the owner of the hotel and often visited. The Burris hotel became the &quot;Shady Rest Hotel&quot; on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. The Shady Rest is located down the tracks from &quot;downtown&quot; Hooterville, just inside the Hooterville county line. In one episode, it is revealed that the Shady Rest was built right on the county line between Hooterville county and Pixley county. The situation is solved when the &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot; tows the hotel several feet until it is fully within the Hooterville boundary. The hotel is run by widow Kate Bradley (played by Bea Benaderet) and her lazy-but-lovable uncle, Uncle Joe Carson (Edgar Buchanan). Kate has three daughters, &quot;boy crazy&quot; Billie Jo (Jeannine Riley, 1963–1965; Gunilla Hutton, 1965–1966; Meredith MacRae, 1967–1970), sexy bookworm Bobbie Jo (Pat Woodell, 1963–1965; Lori Saunders, 1965–1970), and &quot;tomboy&quot; Betty Jo (Linda Kaye Henning, 1963–1970). From 1968 to 1970, actress June Lockhart played Dr. Janet Craig, whose office was behind the register desk of the Shady Rest.

===&quot;Green Acres&quot;===

&quot;Green Acres&quot; (1965–1971) is about a wealthy New York City couple, lawyer Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert) and his diamond-clad wife, Lisa (Eva Gabor), who give up their Park Avenue penthouse for a run-down farm, &quot;The Old Haney Place&quot;. In &quot;Green Acres&quot; Hooterville is portrayed as a much more wacky, surreal place than it is in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. Though the shows share some characters, the humor in &quot;Green Acres&quot; is often far broader. The major overlap between the two shows is shopkeeper–postman–newsman Sam Drucker. In this series, the town is said to be named after Horace Hooter, who founded the town in 1868. According to &quot;Green Acres&quot;, Hooterville is in &quot;the kangaroo state&quot;. When Oliver visits the governor, the governor gives him a plushie kangaroo as state memorabilia. Lisa consistently mispronounces the name of the town as &quot;Hootersville&quot;. A running gag is that Hooterville is so remote that the only way to get there is by parachute. However, a plot hole shows that Hooterville is connected on a railroad and has a nearby airport in Pixley.

==Population and elevation inconsistencies==
On the series &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, Hooterville appears to be a fairly large town, able to support a high school and several other institutions. In 1963, the county has a population of around 3,000 citizens. And the sign at the Hooterville railroad station says that the town is situated at an elevation of 1,427 feet. However, on &quot;Green Acres&quot;, the population of Hooterville is said to be much smaller and the elevation much lower. In the episode &quot;The Youth Center&quot;, general store owner Sam Drucker says that a sign showing the population as 48 and the elevation as 23 inches is incorrect since two young people recently moved away and the elevation is down to 18 inches. When Oliver Douglas asks him how the elevation could change, Sam explains that &quot;Hooterville is subject to sinking spells.&quot; Oliver refers to Hooterville as being &quot;2 inches above sea level&quot; in the &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Jam Session&quot;.

==Location of Hooterville==
The exact location of Hooterville is never stated on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; or &quot;Green Acres&quot;. &quot;The weather in Texas&quot; is mentioned in the episode &quot;A Cottage for Two: Part 3&quot;, when Kate is talking to the girls about their father. He would go fishing, pitch horseshoes, and talk about the weather in Texas, she tells them in a conversation. The shows are rife with conflicting clues, so assigning a location will never be decisive. It cannot even be determined if Hooterville is in the east or the west of the United States. In the &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode &quot;Music to Milk By&quot;, the call letters of the nearby Pixley radio station that Eb Dawson listens to begin with the letter W, rather than K, suggesting that Pixley and Hooterville are east of the Mississippi River. The Pixley television station&#x27;s call letters are WPIXL, which would put it east of the river. (There were some early exceptions to the W and K nomenclature.) Even the outsiders within the fictional world of the shows have a hard time locating the town. Hooterville is so obscure that in one episode a fly covers it on a map; in another episode the only way a government bureaucrat can get to Hooterville is by parachute. In season 2, episode 9 – &quot;The Hooterville Image&quot; – Mr. Haney is talking with Mr. Ziffel, Mr. Kiley, and Mr. Drucker about the suits that Oliver wears while farming. Mr. Haney states that tourists see Oliver and think they are still in the outskirts of Chicago.

During the Jethrine Bodine &quot;crossover,&quot; Jed Clampett noted that he had never heard of the town before Granny mentioned it, indicating it is nowhere near the Clampett family&#x27;s original shack (the location of which has also been the subject of speculation).

===Possible Hooterville locations===
;Missouri
The original inspiration for &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; came from Paul Henning&#x27;s wife, Ruth. As a child, Ruth traveled by train to her grandparents&#x27; hotel in Eldon, Missouri. Other than the hotel and the train, though, there is little resemblance between Hooterville and Eldon, Missouri. One of the pre-production working titles for &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was &quot;Ozark Widow&quot;. In one episode, the characters on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; go back home to find a husband for Elly Mae. &quot;Back home&quot; turns out to be the Missouri Ozarks theme park Silver Dollar City, which is treated as a real town on the show.

;Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi or Arkansas
At one point, Granny from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; visits Hooterville and wants to marry Sam Drucker. When she is asked how she knows Sam Drucker, she replies &quot;We is neighbors!&quot; and then explains that Hooterville is just over the state line from her home state of Tennessee. According to this clue, Hooterville is in one of the eight states that border Tennessee.

;North Carolina
Of the eight states that border Tennessee, only North Carolina includes the Great Smoky Mountains, where Granny says she is from: &quot;When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys&#x27; hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods The Smoky Mountains.&quot; So is it Hooterville, North Carolina? It is not the most popular guess, or the only guess, but it does follow a major bit of storyline affecting two different shows. It is worth mentioning that the town of Hendersonville, North Carolina, which is in about the right location, actually refers to itself as &quot;Hooterville&quot;. (Although that may or may not be because of &quot;Green Acres&quot;. The link leads to one local author&#x27;s explanation of why they call themselves &quot;Hooterville,&quot; in which he states that the origin of the name pre-dates the show.)

;Kentucky
In some ways, the best argument is for Kentucky. Sam Drucker, Hooterville grocer and postmaster, gives the ZIP Code for Hooterville as 40516½ in the 1990 reunion movie &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;. 40516 is a ZIP Code for Lexington, Kentucky, a city from Chicago. The character Mr. Haney on &quot;Green Acres&quot; says that Chicago is nearly 300 miles (480 km) away from Hooterville. Mr. Haney mentioned the &quot;High Flyer Diner&quot; — owned by one of his cousins — being on &quot;Highway 27&quot;. US Route 27 passes through Lexington, Kentucky, and most importantly, right along the boundary of ZIP Code 40516. In the &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; episode &quot;Betty Jo&#x27;s Dog&quot;, they talk of sending the dog back on the train to Louisville. Also, Lexington, Kentucky, is near Springfield, Kentucky, and a nearby town of Hooterville is called &quot;Springfield&quot;. That is the most common place name in the U.S., but the shows have frequent references to Bug Tussle or Bugtussle (sometimes identified as Granny&#x27;s hometown), and that is the name of a place on KY 87 in Monroe County, Kentucky, on the Tennessee border west of Gamaliel. One argument against Kentucky is that one episode says the county seat is 75 miles from Hooterville, and no Kentucky county is that large.

;Pennsylvania
The name Hooterville approximates Hooverville, a term used for the shantytowns that emerged during the Great Depression. But it also approximates Hooversville, Pennsylvania, a bucolic town on railroad tracks in western Pennsylvania. Also, characters on &quot;Green Acres&quot; visit New York City on occasion and apparently return within a day&#x27;s time.

;South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, (and Missouri and Kentucky)
In the &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; episode &quot;The Valley&#x27;s New Owner&quot;, it is revealed that Hooterville was in a Confederate state during the Civil War. Missouri and Kentucky were Union states during the war, but they were claimed and for a time partially controlled by the Confederacy, which gave them stars in its battle flag. Florida and Louisiana were part of the Confederacy, but are excluded from this list because their elevations are too low (see below).

;North Dakota
An early scene in the 90-minute series pilot (a two-hour presentation with commercials) takes place in the board room of the C&amp;FW Railroad Company, which operates the steam-powered Hooterville Cannonball and the 50-mile spur between the hamlets of Hooterville and Pixley upon which it runs. The senior management team of the C&amp;FW are gathered for a presentation by (presumably) the president of the company, Norman Curtis, in which he proudly exclaims that the &quot;super-charged diesel locomotive,&quot; a large model of which is on the conference room table, &quot;is now standard equipment on the entire C&amp;FW system.&quot; The curtains are then pulled on the back wall of the conference room (by none other than Homer Bedloe) to reveal a map of the C&amp;FW Railroad line. The map shows that the C&amp;FW system serves the northern Great Plains area of the United States, from Lake Superior in the east, into Montana and Wyoming in the west, as far south (but no farther) than Nebraska, and as far north as the Dakotas. The newly-updated C&amp;FW system is indicated with broad lines on the map, with all of the towns along the mainline indicated with white dots. As Curtis proudly points to the map, calling the C&amp;FW the &quot;most modern, most progressive ...,&quot; he is stopped short by a small scrawl on the map. When the camera zooms in, the scrawl turns out to be the cut-off spur line between the towns of Hooterville and Pixley, which the map clearly registers as being in south-central North Dakota.

===Hooterville is not in these states===
Hooterville is not in New York, based on two episodes from season one of &quot;Green Acres&quot;. In episode 21, &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name?&quot;, Ralph Monroe wishes to have her name changed to Sophia. When Oliver presents his petition to the court, he is informed by the judge that &quot;this state does not have a reciprocal agreement with New York State. Therefore, your credentials are not acceptable. You are not authorized to practice law in this state.&quot; In episode 24, &quot;The Deputy&quot;, Oliver points out the license plate on his Lincoln Continental to Officer Heston Haney, a blue and yellow New York plate 4G-8561. Officer Haney says &quot;Oh, New York plates, huh. You live there?&quot; to which Oliver replies &quot;No, I live here&quot;. When Officer Haney finds out that Oliver has lived in the state for 7 months he writes Oliver a citation stating &quot;We have a law. All out-of-state residents who reside in state more than six months are required to replace their out-of-state plates with in-state.&quot; When handing Oliver the ticket Officer Haney says &quot;Now there you are, there&#x27;s your in-state traffic citation for havin&#x27; out-of-state plates.&quot;

Hooterville is not in Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Connecticut, or Indiana, based on character comments in the third season of &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Each of these states is referred to by characters as being elsewhere. Also, given its elevation of 1,427 feet (as seen on the sign in the railroad station), Hooterville is too low to be in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, or Wyoming, and too high to be in Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, or Rhode Island.

Hooterville is not in any state that didn&#x27;t exist prior to the end of the American Civil War, nor any state that wasn&#x27;t part of the Confederacy, with the possible exceptions of Missouri, Kentucky, or West Virginia. This is proven in the episode of Petticoat Junction entitled &quot;The Valley&#x27;s New Owner&quot; (S7 Ep18). While discussing a deed showing Orrin Pike was the owner of the entire Hooterville Valley, Dr. Janet Craig says to Orrin Pike &quot;the Confederate governor that signed this, gave away land that he didn&#x27;t own.&quot;

===Real cities within 500 miles===
In numerous episodes, it is said that they are close to Chicago. In one &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode, Mr. Haney says that Chicago is nearly 300 miles (480 km) away. Eldon, Missouri, the inspiration for the show, is right at , as the crow flies, from Chicago. Numerous cities and towns are nearly 300 miles from Chicago in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Kentucky. In one &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; episode, Billie Jo talks about going to the big city Omaha, Nebraska, and in another Uncle Joe talks about going to Sioux City, Iowa. In the first episode of the series a map shows the railroad line surrounding Hooterville, it appears to be a branch line with the two closes cities on the main line being Skidmore and Melton both locations in Missouri with the first being a city and the latter an unincorporated town in the Ozarks. In Season 5, episode 20, Uncle Joe talks about a time when a &quot;hayseed&quot; from Mason City ran off with a girl that owned a factory in Dubuque, both of which are real towns in Iowa. Also, later in Season 5, in episode 29, Sam Drucker mentions a guy from Cedar Falls which is a real Iowa town 75 miles to the South-East of Mason City and 100 miles due West of Dubuque. Additionally, it is often said that a nearby town is called Springfield, which could mean Springfield, Illinois, Springfield, Missouri, or the Springfield Township, Cedar County, Iowa. However, &quot;Springfield&quot; is a common (and geographically ambiguous) fictional city name on television, as seen in such shows as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;.

===Fictional nearby towns===
A larger nearby town is called &quot;Pixley&quot;, and there is an ongoing rivalry between the two communities. Pixley is the closest town to Hooterville, about 50 miles away. Pixley comically boasts several things that no small farm town in America would have. Among them are a very tiny international airport (Pixley International Airport, the hub of Trans Pixley Airlines) and a television station, WPIXL, Channel 5. Other towns in the area include Crabwell Corners (about 5– away), Stankwell Falls (distance never stated), Bug Tussle or Bugtussle (about 20– away), Bleedswell (distance never stated), the unnamed county seat (about away), Springfield (distance never stated), Appleville (300 miles away), and the unnamed state capital (500 miles away).

In Season 4, Episode 12 of &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;How to Get from Hooterville to Pixley Without Moving&quot;, the Douglas&#x27; farmhouse is thought to be in Pixley and the barn in Hooterville. By the episode&#x27;s end, we learn there was an error and the farmhouse &quot;is&quot; in Hooterville after all. The barn is in Pixley and much to Oliver&#x27;s surprise, the rest of his farm is in Crabwell Corners, so the three towns must be of large physical areas. It is possible one or more of these were not &quot;towns&quot; as such but &quot;Census Designated Places&quot;; a CDP can cover a very large area yet only have a few dozen residents, whose street address, PO Box, and phone will be listed in that &quot;town&quot;.

In one episode of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, surveyors determine that the Shady Rest Hotel was built on top of the city boundary line between Hooterville and Pixley. This could imply that the two towns are much closer together than originally thought, but it may also reflect the geography of the northeastern or midwestern U.S., in which most of the land area is assigned to a town. Or, it could refer to separate districts on the county legislative body.
There is a story that Hooterville is actually a Hollywood reinterpretation of “Porterville” in Tulare County, a farming community north of Los Angeles. This seems likely as the actual town of Pixley is not far from Porterville, and there is even a named place listed on some maps, south of Porterville, that is called Green Acres.

==Popular culture==
An episode of the television series &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; is titled &quot;It Never Rains in Hooterville&quot;. In the episode, Alan Harper tells his brother Charlie about his disastrous rainy camp night with his son Jake. Charlie asks where Jake is now, and Alan says that he went with his friends to Hooterville, to which Charlie replies &quot;It never rains in Hooterville&quot;.

In the song &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, singer Gil Scott-Heron refers to &quot;Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville Junction&quot; as symbols of mainstream viewing habits that &quot;will no longer be so damned relevant&quot; when the &quot;Revolution&quot; comes.

<text>Sikkim Janata Party was a political party in Sikkim. The party was founded in Gangtok on December 18, 1969 founded by Lal Bahadur Basnet. The party was formed after a split in the Sikkim National Congress. Basnet, a well-known journalist and former general secretary of the Sikkim National Congress, served as the president of the party. K.C. Pradhan was the general secretary of the party.

Ideologically the party was committed to socialism, democracy and the unity of the Sikkimese people. The party was active in the struggle for democratic reforms. It demanded Sikkim adopt a written constitution.

The party was mainly supported by Nepali community. The party suffered from weak organization and lack of financial backing. The party contested four seats in the fourth general election of 1970. Basnet had himself contested two seats in the election. Compared to other opposition parties, the Sikkim Janata Party took more radical postures. During the election campaign the party called for revision of the 1950 India-Sikkim Peace Treaty, calling for greater autonomy for Sikkim (positions shared with the Sikkim National Congress and the Sikkim State Congress). The party condemned the 1950 treaty as a &#x27;slander on Sikkim&#x27;.

Karma Lama of the Sikkim Janata Party contested the Sangha seat, finishing in second place with 46 votes (10.31%).

Following the election, in which the party failed to win any seats, Basnet resigned from the party presidency and left the party. Another key leader of the party, B.B. Gurung, also renounced his membership. After these departures, K.C. Pradhan became the main leader of the party.

On August 15, 1972 SJP reached an agreement with the Sikkim State Congress to merge the two parties. The merger was completed on October 26, 1972, with the formation of the Sikkim Janata Congress.

<text>The Sikkim State Congress, or &quot;SSC&quot;, was an annexationist political party in the Kingdom of Sikkim. It was founded in 1947 and worked closely with the Indian National Congress (INC) to successfully achieve the annexation of Sikkim to India. Other parties established by the INC to serve India&#x27;s interests in its near abroad included the Nepal State Congress Party and the Bhutan State Congress Party.

==History==

Sikkim State Congress was formed on 7th December 1947 after localised organisations Praja Sudharak Samaj, Praja Sammelan and Praja Mandal jointly decided to form a unified party. Tashi Tshering was the President of the newly formed party. The SSC&#x27;s main constituents were Nepalese, while its opponent, the Sikkim National Party, had support among the Bhutia and Lepcha people. It campaigned to change the election system from a confessional system to a &quot;one man, one vote&quot; system. When that reform happened in 1974, the numerically superior Nepalese made the Congress Sikkim&#x27;s dominant political party. Some anti-clerical and other modernizing elites within the Bhutia-Lepcha community joined the Sikkim State Congress, because of its desire to abolish landlordism. Kazi Lhendup Dorjee, one of these, was president of the party between 1953 and 1958.

Tashi Tshering, Gobardhan Pradhan, DB Tiwari, CD Rai, DS Lepcha, Sonam Tshering, LD Kazi, Roy Choudhary and Helen Lepcha are among the founder members of the party. Tashi Tshering, Kashiraj Pradhan, Nahakul Pradhan and Chandra Das Rai were other prominent leaders who have led the party before the merger with India. 

After the formation of the Congress, Tshering organised its first public meeting in 7 December 1947 at Gangtok demanding abolishing landlordism, forming an interim government and accession to India. The Congress started fresh agitation in February,1949 demanding the formation of an interim government and democratic reforms following which Chandra Das Rai and five others were arrested. This was followed by Congress supporters encircling the Palace on 1 May, 1949. On 8 May 1949, Chogyal appointed Sikkim&#x27;s first interim government led by Chief Minister Tashi Tshering and his popular ministry. However the government was dismissed within 29 days by the Indian Political Officer Harishwar Dayal.

By late 1950s to the 1970s the party was led by Kashiraj Pradhan and his nephew Nahakul Pradhan, both serving as President of the party in different decades. Under their leadership the party greatly moderated it’s anti-Chogyal stand and participated in the Royal Sikkimese administration through subsequent wins in elections to the State Council. By the early 1970s, Nahakul Pradhan led party demanded for a responsible government under the Chogyal opposing the demands of Kazi Lhendup Dorjee led Sikkim National Congress.
The party was part of Sikkimese administration throughout the pre merger period with subsequent wins in all elections to the State council. Later SSC merged with Sikkim Janata Party in 1972, forming the Sikkim Janata Congress.

<text>Sikkim National Party was a political party in the Kingdom of Sikkim, formed in 1950. The Sikkim National Party was in favour of the monarchy and advocated independence for Sikkim. The party was founded to counter the growing influence of the pro-Indian parties Sikkim State Congress and Rajya Praja Sammelan, that had been formed after the independence of India in 1947.

In the last elections for the Sikkim State Council before the fall of the monarchy in 1975, NP only won the seat of Kabi-Tingda (the sole seat not won by Dorjee&#x27;s unified Congress party).

<doc id="1181646" wikidata="Q185517" url="?curid=1181646" title="War on drugs">
<text>The war on drugs is a global anti-narcotics campaign led by the United States federal government, including drug prohibition, foreign assistance, and military intervention, with the aim of reducing the illegal drug trade in the US. The initiative includes a set of drug policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments, through United Nations treaties, have made illegal.

The term &quot;war on drugs&quot; was popularized by the media after a press conference, given on June 17, 1971, during which President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse &quot;public enemy number one&quot;. He stated, &quot;In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive... This will be a worldwide offensive... It will be government-wide... and it will be nationwide.&quot; Earlier that day, Nixon had presented a special message to the US Congress on &quot;Drug Abuse Prevention and Control&quot;, which included text about devoting more federal resources to the &quot;prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted&quot;; that aspect did not receive the same media attention as the term &quot;war on drugs&quot;.

In the years since, presidential administrations and Congress have generally maintained or expanded Nixon&#x27;s original initiatives, with the emphasis on law enforcement and interdiction over public health and treatment. Cannabis presents a special case; it came under federal restriction in the 1930s, and since 1970 has been classified as having a high potential for abuse and no medical value, with the same level of prohibition as heroin. Multiple mainstream studies and findings since the 1930s have recommended against such a severe classification. Beginning in the 1990s, cannabis has been legalized for medical use in 38 states, and also for recreational use in 24, creating a policy gap with federal law and non-compliance with the UN drug treaties.

In June 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy released a critical report, declaring: &quot;The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world.&quot; In 2023, the UN high commissioner for Human Rights stated that &quot;decades of punitive, &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; strategies had failed to prevent an increasing range and quantity of substances from being produced and consumed.&quot; That year, the annual US federal drug war budget reached $39 billion, with cumulative spending since 1971 estimated at $1 trillion.

, the war on drugs continues, with a focus on fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.

Starting in 2025, the war on drugs will adopt a new approach focused on counterterrorism after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding that several drug cartels and other criminal organizations be added to the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. With the cartels being officially classified as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S., it is believed to have imposed a new paradigm in the war on drugs. 

== History ==
Drugs in the US were largely unregulated until the early 20th century. Opium had been used to relieve pain since the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), particularly in the treatment of soldiers during wartime. In the 1800s, the international opium trade was large-scale enterprise: Britain, and to a lesser degree the other European colonial powers and the US, gained immense profits from selling opium in China and southeast Asia; two opium wars were fought mid-century by Britain and allies against China to ensure the trade continued to serve millions of Chinese opium users. In America, the use of opiates in the civilian population began to increase dramatically, and cocaine use became prevalent. Alcohol consumption steadily grew, as did the temperance movement, well-supported by the middle class, promoting moderation or abstinence. The practice of smoking cannabis began to be noticed in the early 1900s. State and local governments began enacting drug laws in the mid-1800s. Under the US Constitution, the authority to control dangerous drugs exists separately at both the federal and state level. Federal drug legislation arrived after the turn of the century.

=== Mid-1800s–1909: Proliferation of unregulated drug use ===

The latter half of the 19th century saw a ramping up of opiate use in America. Early in the century, morphine had been isolated from opium, decades later, heroin was created from morphine, each more potent than the previous form. With the invention of the hypodermic syringe, introduced in America mid-century, opiates were easily administered and became a preferred medical treatment. During the Civil War (1861–1865), millions of doses of opiates were distributed to sick and wounded soldiers, addicting some; domestic poppy fields were planted in an attempt to meet shortages (the crops proved to be of poor quality). In the civilian population, physicians treated opiates like a wonder drug, prescribing them widely, for chronic pain, irritable babies, asthma, bronchitis, insomnia, &quot;nervous conditions&quot;, hysteria, menstrual cramps, morning sickness, gastrointestinal disease, &quot;vapors&quot;, and on.

Drugs were also sold over-the-counter as home remedies, and in refreshments. Laudanum, a powdered opium solution, was commonly found in the home medicine cabinet. Heroin was available as a cough syrup. Cocaine was introduced as a surgical anesthetic, and more popularly as a pick-me-up, found in soft drinks, cigarettes, blended with wine, in snuff, and other forms. Brand names appeared: Coca-Cola contained cocaine until 1903; Bayer created the trademark name &quot;Heroin&quot; for their diamorphine product. In the 1890s, the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog, distributed to millions of American homes, offered a syringe and a small amount of heroin for $1.50.

==== America&#x27;s &quot;first opioid crisis&quot; ====
The 1880s saw opiate addiction surge among among housewives, doctors, and Civil War veterans, creating America&#x27;s &quot;first opioid crisis.&quot; By the end of the century, an estimated one in 200 Americans were addicted to opiates, 60% of them women, typically white and middle- to upper-class. Medical journals of the later 1800s were replete with warnings against overprescription. As medical advances like the x-ray, vaccines, and germ theory presented better treatment options, prescribed opiate use began to decline. Meanwhile, opium smoking remained popular among Chinese immigrant laborers, thousands of whom had arrived during the California gold rush; opium dens were established in Chinatowns in cities and towns across America. The public face of opiate use began to change, from affluent white Americans, to &quot;Chinese, gamblers, and prostitutes.&quot;

During this period, states and municipalities began enacting laws banning or regulating certain drugs. In Pennsylvania, an anti-morphine law was passed in 1860. In 1875, San Francisco enacted an anti-opium ordinance, vigorously enforced, imposing stiff fines and jail for visiting opium dens. The rationale held that &quot;many women and young girls, as well as young men of a respectable family, were being induced to visit the Chinese opium-smoking dens, where they were ruined morally and otherwise.&quot; The law catered to resentment towards the Chinese laborer population who were being accused of taking jobs; other uses of opiates or other drugs were unaffected. Similar laws were enacted in other states and cities. The federal government became involved, selectively raising the import tariff on the smoking grade of opium. None of these measures proved effective in significantly reducing opium use (the anti-Chinese fervor led to Congress halting Chinese laborer immigration for 10 years with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882). In the following years, opioids, cocaine, and cannabis were associated with various ethnic minorities and targeted in other local jurisdictions.

In 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act, also known as the Wiley Act, addressed problems with tainted and adulterated food in the growing industrial food system, and with drug quality, by mandating ingredient labels and prohibiting false or misleading labeling. For drugs, a listing of active ingredients was required; a set of drugs deemed addictive or dangerous, that included opium, morphine, cocaine, caffeine, and cannabis, was specified. Oversight of the act was assigned to the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Bureau of Chemistry, which evolved into the Food and Drug Administration in 1930.

=== 1909–1971: Rise of federal drug prohibition ===

On February 9, 1909, the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act, &quot;to prohibit the importation and use of opium for other than medicinal purposes&quot;, became the first US federal law to ban the non-medical use of a substance. This was soon followed by the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, that regulated and taxed the production, importation, and distribution of opiates and coca products. Amending the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act, the Anti-Heroin Act of 1924 specifically outlawed the manufacture, importation and sale of heroin.

During World War I (1914–1918), soldiers were commonly treated with morphine, giving rise to addiction among veterans. An international wartime focus on military use of opiates and cocaine for medical treatment and performance enhancement, and concern over potential abuse, led to the global adoption of the International Opium Convention, through its incorporation into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, with administration by the newly established League of Nations. The treaty, originally formulated in 1912 but not widely implemented, became the basis of current international drug control policy. It was initially concerned with regulating the free trade of drugs, without affecting production or use. The US, one of the most prohibitionist countries, felt these provisions did not go far enough in restricting drugs.

In 1919, the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution was ratified, prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of &quot;intoxicating liquors&quot;, with exceptions for religious and medical use. To enforce the amendment, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act. By the 1930s, the policy was seen as a failure: production and consumption of alcohol persisted, organized crime flourished in the alcohol black market, and tax revenue, particularly needed after the start of the Great Depression in 1929, was lost. Prohibition was repealed by passage of the 21st Amendment in 1933, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945) asking Americans not to abuse &quot;this return to personal freedom.&quot;

In 1922, the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act broadened federal regulation of opiates and coca products by prohibiting import and export for non-medical use, and established the Federal Narcotics Control Board (FNCB) to administrate.

==== Anslinger era begins ====

The Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) was established as an agency of the US Department of the Treasury by an act of June 14, 1930, with Harry J. Anslinger appointed as commissioner, a position he held for 32 years, until 1962. Anslinger supported Prohibition and the criminalization of all drugs, and spearheaded anti-drug policy campaigns. He did not support a public health and treatment approach, instead urging courts to &quot;jail offenders, then throw away the key.&quot; He has been characterized as the first architect of the punitive war on drugs. According to a report prepared for the Senate of Canada, Anslinger was &quot;utterly devoted to prohibition and the control of drug supplies at the source&quot; and is &quot;widely recognized as having had one of the more powerful impacts on the development of US drug policy, and, by extension, international drug control into the early 1970s.&quot;

During his three decades heading the FBN, Anslinger zealously and effectively pursued harsh drug penalties, with a particular focus on cannabis. He used his stature as the head of a federal agency to draft legislation, discredit critics, discount medical opinion and scientific findings, and convince lawmakers. Publicly, he used the media and speaking engagements to introduce hyperbolic messages about the evils of drug use. In the 1930s, he referred to a collection of news reports of horrific crimes, making unsubstantiated claims attributing them to drugs, particularly cannabis. He announced that youth become &quot;slaves&quot; to cannabis, &quot;continuing addiction until they deteriorate mentally, become insane, turn to violent crime and murder.&quot; He promoted a racialized view of drug use, saying that blacks and Latinos were the primary abusers. In Congressional testimony, he declared &quot;of all the offenses committed against the laws of this country, the narcotic addict is the most frequent offender.&quot; He was also an effective administrator and diplomat, attending international drug conferences and steadily expanding the FBN&#x27;s influence.

In 1935, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on President Roosevelt&#x27;s public support of the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act under the headline, &quot;Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid&quot;. The Uniform Law Commission developed the act to address the 1914 Harrison Act&#x27;s lack of state-level enforcement provisions, creating a model law reflecting the Harrison Act that states could adopt to replace the existing patchwork of state laws. Anslinger and the FBN were centrally involved in drafting the act, and in convincing states to adopt it.

==== Cannabis effectively outlawed, prescription drugs ====
With the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, federal law reflected state lawby 1936, the non-medical use of cannabis had been banned in every state. That year, the first two arrests for tax non-payment under the act, for possession of a quarter-ounce (7g), and trafficking of four pounds (1.8 kg), resulted in sentences of nearly 18 months and four years respectively. The American Medical Association (AMA) had opposed the tax act on grounds that it unduly affected the medical use of cannabis. The AMA&#x27;s legislative counsel, a physician, testified that the claims about cannabis addiction, violence and overdoses were not supported by evidence. Scholars have posited that the act was orchestrated by powerful business interests – Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family – to head off cheap competition to pulp and timber and plastics from the hemp industry. After the act, cannabis research and medical testing became rare.

In 1939, New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, an opponent of the Marihuana Tax Act, formed the LaGuardia Committee to conduct the first US in-depth study of cannabis use. The report, produced by the New York Academy of Medicine and released in 1944, systematically contradicted government claims, finding that cannabis is not physically addictive, and its use does not lead to using other drugs or to crime. The FBN&#x27;s Anslinger branded the study &quot;unscientific&quot;, denounced all involved, and disrupted other cannabis studies at the time.

In the late 1930s, questions emerged from League of Nations&#x27; Opium Advisory Committee concerning the focus on drug prohibition over public health measures such as mental health treatment, drug dispensaries and education. Anslinger, backed by his Canadian counterpart and policy ally, Charles Henry Ludovic Sharman, successfully argued against this view, and kept the focus on increasing global prohibition and supply control measures.

While narcotics were under the jurisdiction of the FBN, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 required the FDA to ensure that non-narcotic drugs were labeled for safe use. The act determined that certain drugs, including amphetamines, commercialized in the later 1930s, and barbiturates, were unsafe to use without medical supervision and could only be obtained by doctor&#x27;s prescription. This marked the beginning of the federal distinction between over-the-counter and prescription drugs (clarified in the Durham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951).
==== Amphetamines, harsher penalties, international obligations ====
During World War II (1939–1945), in addition to the widespread use of morphine, amphetamines entered military use to combat fatigue and improve morale. In the US, the Benzedrine brand was widely used in the military, and quickly became popular in the public for a variety of medical and recreational applications. Beginning in 1943, American soldiers could buy Benzedrine directly from the army on demand. Post-war, amphetamines were promoted as mood elevators and diet pills to great success; by 1945, an estimated 750 million tablets a year were being produced in the US, enough to provide a million people with a daily supply, a trend that grew during the 1950s and 1960s.

Having failed to preserve world peace, the League of Nations ended post-war, transferring responsibilities to its successor, the United Nations. Anslinger, supported by Sharman, successfully campaigned to ensure that law enforcement and the prohibitionist view remained central to international drug policy. With the 1946 Lake Success Protocol, he helped to make sure that law enforcement was represented on the UN&#x27;s new drug policy Supervisory Body (today&#x27;s International Narcotics Control Board), and that it did not fall under a public health-oriented agency like the WHO.

In the early 1950s, responding to &quot;white suburban grassroots movements&quot; concerned about dealers preying on teenagers, liberal politicians at state level cracked down on drugs. California, Illinois, and New York passed the first mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses; Congress followed with the Boggs Act of 1951, creating the first federal mandatory minimums for drugs. The act unified penalties for the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act and the Marihuana Tax Act, effectively criminalizing cannabis. Anslinger testified in favor of the inclusion of cannabis, describing a &quot;stepping-stone&quot; path leading from cannabis to harder drugs and crime. First-offense possession of cannabis carried a 2–10 year minimum and a fine of up to $20,000. This marked a change in Congress&#x27;s approach to mandatory minimums, increasing their number, severity, and the crimes they covered. According to the United States Sentencing Commission, reporting in 2012: &quot;Before 1951, mandatory minimum penalties typically punished offenses concerning treason, murder, piracy, rape, slave trafficking, internal revenue collection, and counterfeiting. Today, the majority of convictions under statutes carrying mandatory minimum penalties relate to controlled substances, firearms, identity theft, and child sex offenses.&quot;.

In 1961, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs became the first of three UN treaties that together form the legal framework for international drug control, and require that domestic drug laws in member countries comply with the conventions. The Single Convention unified existing international drug agreements, and limited possession and use of opiates, cannabis and cocaine to &quot;medicinal and scientific purposes&quot;, prohibiting recreational use. Sixty-four countries initially joined; it was ratified and came into force in the US in 1967. The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 added synthetic, prescription and hallucinogenic drugs. The Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 addressed international drug trafficking and &quot;criminalized the entire drug market chain, from cultivation/production to shipment, sale, and possession.&quot;

In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–69) decided that the government needed to make an effort to curtail the social unrest that blanketed the country at the time. He focused on illegal drug use, an approach that was in line with expert opinion on the subject at the time. In the 1960s, it was believed that at least half of the crime in the US was drug-related, and this estimate grew as high as 90% in the next decade. He created the Reorganization Plan of 1968 which merged the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs within the Department of Justice.

==== Federal drug schedule system introduced ====
The Richard Nixon presidency (1969–74) incorporated his predecessor&#x27;s anti-drug initiative in a tough-on-crime platform. In his 1968 presidential nomination acceptance speech, Nixon promised, &quot;Our new Attorney General will ... launch a war against organized crime in this country. ... will be an active belligerent against the loan sharks and the numbers racketeers that rob the urban poor. ... will open a new front against the filth peddlers and the narcotics peddlers who are corrupting the lives of the children of this country.&quot; In a 1969 special message to Congress, he identified drug abuse as &quot;a serious national threat&quot;.

On October 27, 1970, Nixon signed into law the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, establishing his approach to drug control. The act largely repealed mandatory minimum sentences: simple possession was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, the first offense carried a maximum of one year in prison, and judges had the latitude to assign probation, parole or dismissal. Penalties for trafficking were increased, up to life depending on the quantity and type of drug. Funding was authorized for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to provide treatment, rehabilitation and education. Additional federal drug agents were provided, and a &quot;no-knock&quot; power was instituted, that allowed entry into homes without warning to prevent evidence from being destroyed. Licensing and stricter reporting and record-keeping for pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors occurred under the act. Title II of Act, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), helped align US law with the UN Single Convention, with &quot;many of the provisions of the CSA ... enacted by Congress for the specific purpose of ensuring U.S. compliance with the treaty.&quot; The CSA&#x27;s five drug Schedules, an implementation of the Single Convention&#x27;s four schedule system, categorized drugs based on medical value and potential for abuse.

Under the new drug schedules, cannabis was provisionally placed by the administration in the most restrictive Schedule I, &quot;until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue.&quot; As mandated by the CSA, Nixon appointed the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, known as the Shafer Commission, to investigate.

=== 1971–present: The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; ===
On May 27, 1971, after a trip to Vietnam, two congressmen, Morgan F. Murphy (Democrat) and Robert H. Steele (Republican), released a report describing a &quot;rapid increase in heroin addiction within the United States military forces in South Vietnam&quot;. They estimated that &quot;as many as 10 to 15 percent of our servicemen are addicted to heroin in one form or another.&quot; On June 6, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;It&#x27;s Always A Dead End on &#x27;Scag Alley, cited the Murphy-Steele report in a discussion of heroin addiction. The article stated that, in the US, &quot;the number of addicts is estimated at 200,000 to 250,000, only about one‐tenth of 1 per cent of the population but troublesome out of all proportion.&quot; It also noted, &quot;Heroin is not the only drug problem in the United States. &#x27;Speed&#x27; pillsamong them, amphetaminesare another problem, and not least in the suburbs where they are taken by the housewife (to cure her of the daily &#x27;blues&#x27;) and by her husband (to keep his weight down).&quot;

On June 17, 1971, Nixon presented to Congress a plan for expanded anti-drug abuse measures. He painted a dire picture: &quot;Present efforts to control drug abuse are not sufficient in themselves. The problem has assumed the dimensions of a national emergency. ... If we cannot destroy the drug menace in America, then it will surely in time destroy us.&quot; His strategy involved both treatment and interdiction: &quot;I am proposing the appropriation of additional funds to meet the cost of rehabilitating drug users, and I will ask for additional funds to increase our enforcement efforts to further tighten the noose around the necks of drug peddlers, and thereby loosen the noose around the necks of drug users.&quot; He singled out heroin and broadened the scope beyond the US: &quot;To wage an effective war against heroin addiction, we must have international cooperation. In order to secure such cooperation, I am initiating a worldwide escalation in our existing programs for the control of narcotics traffic.&quot;

Later the same day, Nixon held a news conference at the White House, where he described drug abuse as &quot;America&#x27;s public enemy number one.&quot; He announced, &quot;In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive. ... This will be a worldwide offensive dealing with the problems of sources of supply ... It will be government wide, pulling together the nine different fragmented areas within the government in which this problem is now being handled, and it will be nationwide in terms of a new educational program.&quot; Nixon also stated that the problem wouldn&#x27;t end with the addiction of soldiers in the Vietnam War. He pledged to ask Congress for a minimum of $350 million for the anti-drug effort (when he took office in 1969, the federal drug budget was $81 million).

The news media focused on Nixon&#x27;s militaristic tone, describing his announcement with variations of the phrase &quot;war on drugs&quot;. The day after Nixon&#x27;s press conference, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; proclaimed, &quot;Nixon Declares War on Narcotics Use in US&quot;. In England, &quot;The Guardian&quot; headlined, &quot;Nixon declares war on drug addicts.&quot; The US anti-drug campaign came to be commonly referred to as the war on drugs; the term also became used to refer to any government&#x27;s prosecution of a US-style prohibition-based drug policy.

Facing reelection, with drug control as a campaign centerpiece, Nixon formed the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE) in late 1971. ODALE, armed with new federal enforcement powers, began orchestrating drug raids nationwide to improve the administration&#x27;s watchdog reputation. In a private conversation while helicoptering over Brooklyn, Nixon was reported to have commented, &quot;You and I care about treatment. But those people down there, they want those criminals off the streets.&quot; From 1972 to 1973, ODALE performed 6,000 drug arrests in 18 months, the majority of the arrested black.

In 1972, the Shafer Commission released its report, &quot;Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding&quot;, comprising a review of the medical literature and a national drug survey. It recommended decriminalization for personal possession and use of small amounts of cannabis, and prohibition only of supply. The conclusion was not acted on by Nixon or by Congress. Citing the Shafer report, a lobbying campaign from 1973 to 1978, spearheaded by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), convinced 11 states to decriminalize cannabis for personal use.

In 1973, Nixon created the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) by an executive order accepted by Congress, to &quot;establish a single unified command to combat an all-out global war on the drug menace.&quot; The agency was charged with enforcing US controlled substances laws and regulations nationally and internationally, coordinating with federal, state and local agencies and foreign governments, and overseeing legally-produced controlled substances. The DEA absorbed the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, ODALE, and other drug-related federal agencies or personnel from them.

==== Nixon&#x27;s role reviewed ====
Decades later, a controversial quote attributed to John Ehrlichman, Nixon&#x27;s domestic policy advisor, claimed that the war on drugs was fabricated to undermine the anti-war movement and African-Americans. In a 2016 &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; cover story, Ehrlichman, who died in 1999, was quoted from journalist Dan Baum&#x27;s 1994 interview notes: &quot;... by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot; The veracity of the quote was challenged by Ehrlichman&#x27;s children, and Nixon-era officials. In the end, the increasingly punitive reshaping of US drug policy by later administrations was most responsible for creating some of the conditions Ehrlichman described.

In a 2011 commentary, Robert DuPont, Nixon&#x27;s drug czar, argued that the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Act had represented a degree of drug reform. He noted that the act had rolled back mandatory minimum sentencing and balanced the &quot;long-dominant law enforcement approach to drug policy, known as &#x27;supply reduction&#x27;&quot; with an &quot;entirely new and massive commitment to prevention, intervention and treatment, known as &#x27;demand reduction&#x27;&quot;. Thus, Nixon was not in fact the originator of what came to be called the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. During Nixon&#x27;s term, some 70% of federal anti-drug money was spent on demand-side public health measures, and 30% on supply-side interdiction and punishment, a funding ratio not repeated under subsequent administrations.

The war on drugs under the next two presidents, Gerald Ford (1974–77) and Jimmy Carter (1977–81), was essentially a continuation of their predecessors&#x27; policies. Carter&#x27;s campaign platform included decriminalization of cannabis and an end to federal penalties for possession of up to one ounce. In a 1977 &quot;Drug Abuse Message to the Congress&quot;, Carter stated, &quot;Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself.&quot; None of his advocacy was translated into law.

==== Reagan escalation, militarization, and &quot;Just Say No&quot; ====
The presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89) saw an increase in federal focus on interdiction and prosecution. Shortly after his inauguration, Reagan announced, &quot;We&#x27;re taking down the surrender flag that has flown over so many drug efforts; we&#x27;re running up a battle flag.&quot; From 1980 to 1984, the annual budget of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) drug enforcement units went from $8 million to $95 million. In 1982, Vice President George H. W. Bush and his aides began pushing for the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the US military in drug interdiction efforts.

Early in the Reagan term, First Lady Nancy Reagan, with the help of an advertising agency, began her youth-oriented &quot;Just Say No&quot; anti-drug campaign. Propelled by the First Lady&#x27;s tireless promotional efforts through the 1980s, &quot;Just Say No&quot; entered the American vernacular. Later research found that the campaign had little or no impact on youth drug use. One striking change attributed to the effort: public perception of drug abuse as America&#x27;s most serious problem, in the 2-6% range in 1985, rose to 64% in 1989.

In January 1982, Reagan established the South Florida Task Force, chaired by Bush, targeting a surge of cocaine and cannabis entering through the Miami region, and the sharp rise in related crime. The project involved the DEA, the Customs Service, the FBI and other agencies, and Armed Forces ships and planes. It was called the &quot;most ambitious and expensive drug enforcement operation&quot; in US history; critics called it an election year political stunt. By 1986, the task force had made over 15,000 arrests and seized over six million pounds of cannabis and 100,000 pounds of cocaine, doubling cocaine seizures annuallyadministration officials called it Reagan&#x27;s biggest drug enforcement success. However, law enforcement agents at the time said their impact was minimal; cocaine imports had increased by 10%, to an estimated 75-80% of America&#x27;s supply. According to the head of the task force&#x27;s investigative unit, &quot;Law enforcement just can&#x27;t stop the drugs from coming in.&quot; A Bush spokesperson emphasized disrupting smuggling routes rather than seizure quantities as the measure of success.&quot;

In 1984, Reagan signed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which included harsher penalties for cannabis cultivation, possession, and distribution. It also established equitable sharing, a new civil asset forfeiture program that allowed state and local law enforcement to share the proceeds from asset seizures made in collaboration with federal agencies. Under the controversial program, up to 80% of seizure proceeds can go to local law enforcement, expanding their budgets. , $36.5 billion worth of assets had been seized, much of it drug-related, much of it distributed to state and local agencies.

==== Crackdown on crack ====
As the media focused on the emergence of crack cocaine in the early 1980s, the Reagan administration shored up negative public opinion, encouraging the DEA to emphasize the harmful effects of the drug. Stories of &quot;crack whores&quot; and &quot;crack babies&quot; became commonplace. In the summer of 1986, crack dominated the news. &quot;Time&quot; declared crack the issue of the year. &quot;Newsweek&quot; compared the magnitude of the crack story to Vietnam and Watergate. The cocaine overdose deaths of rising basketball star Len Bias, and young NFL football player Don Rogers, both in June, received wide coverage. Riding the wave of public fervor, that October Reagan signed into law much harsher sentencing for crack through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, commonly known as the Len Bias law. According to historian Elizabeth Hinton, &quot;[Reagan] led Congress in criminalizing drug users, especially African American drug users, by concentrating and stiffening penalties for the possession of the crystalline rock form of cocaine, known as &#x27;crack&#x27;, rather than the crystallized methamphetamine that White House officials recognized was as much of a problem among low-income white Americans&quot;.

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act appropriated an additional $1.7 billion to drug war funding, and established 29 new mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses (until then, the American legal system had seen 55 minimum sentences in total). Of particular note, the act made sentences for larger amounts of cocaine 100 times more severe for crack than for the powder form. With the 100:1 ratio, conviction in federal court for possession of 5 grams of crack would receive the same 5-year mandatory minimum as possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine. Debate at the time considered whether crack, generally used by blacks, was more addictive than the powder form, generally used by whites, comparing the effects of snorting powder cocaine with the briefer, more intense high from smoking crack; pharmacologically, there is no difference between the two. According to the DEA, at first crack &quot;was not fully appreciated as a major threat because it was primarily being consumed by middle class users who were not associated with cocaine addicts ... However, partly because crack sold for as little as $5 a rock, it ultimately spread to less affluent neighborhoods.&quot;

Support for Reagan&#x27;s drug crime legislation was bipartisan. According to historian Hinton, Democrats supported drug legislation as they had since the Johnson administration, though Reagan was a Republican.

Internationally, the Reagan term saw a huge increase in US military anti-drug activity in other countries. The Department of Defense budget for interdiction increased from $4.9 million in 1982 to $397 million by 1987. The DEA also expanded its foreign presence. Countries were encouraged to adopt the same type of punitive drug approach that was in place in the US, with the threat of economic sanctions for non-compliance. The UN Single Convention provided a legal framework, and in 1988, the Convention against Illicit Traffic expanded that framework, working the US-style punitive approach into international law.

By the end of Reagan&#x27;s presidency in 1989, illicit drugs were more readily available and cheaper than at the start of his first term in 1981.

==== Hard line maintained and a new opioid crisis ====

Next to occupy the Oval Office, Reagan protégé and former VP George H. W. Bush (1989–93) maintained the hard line drawn by his predecessor and former boss. In his first prime-time address to the nation, Bush held up a plastic bag of crack &quot;seized a few days ago in a park across the street from the White House&quot; (it was later revealed that DEA agents had to lure the seller to Lafayette Park to make the requested arrest). The administration increased narcotics regulation in the first National Drug Control Strategy, issued by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in 1989. The director of ONDCP became commonly known as the US drug czar. In the National Defense Authorization Act for 1990–91, Congress included Section 1208the 1208 Program, expanded into the 1033 Program in 1996authorizing the Department of Defense to transfer surplus military equipment that the DoD determined to be &quot;suitable for use in counter-drug activities&quot;, to local law enforcement agencies.

As president, Bill Clinton (1993–2001), seeking to reposition the Democratic Party as tough on crime, dramatically raised the stakes for drug felonies with his signing of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The act introduced the federal &quot;three-strikes&quot; provision that mandated life imprisonment for violent offenders with two prior convictions for violent crimes or drugs, and provided billions of dollars in funding for states to expand their prison systems and increase law enforcement. During this period, state and local governments initiated controversial drug policies that demonstrated racial biases, such as the stop-and-frisk police practice in New York City, and state-level &quot;three strikes&quot; felony laws, which began with California in 1994.

During the 1990s, opioid use in the US dramatically rose, leading to the ongoing situation commonly called the opioid epidemic. A loose consensus of observers describe three main phases to date: overprescription of legal opioids beginning in the early to mid-1990s; a rise in heroin use in the later 2000s as prescription opioids became more difficult to obtain; and the rise of more powerful fentanyl and other synthetic opioids around the mid-2010s. Prior to 1990s, the use of opioids to treat chronic pain in the US was limited; some scholars suggest there was hesitation to prescribe opioids due to historical problems with addiction dating back to the 1800s. A critical point in the development of the epidemic is often seen as the release in 1996 of OxyContin (oxicodone) by Purdue Pharma, and the subsequent aggressive and deceptive opioid marketing efforts by Purdue and other pharma companies, conducted without sufficient official oversight. Thus the problem emerged from within the healthcare system: the DEA initially targeted doctors, pharmacists, pill mills, and pharmaceutical companies. As law enforcement cracked down on the pharmaceutical supply, illicit drug trafficking in opioids grew to meet demand.

The George W. Bush (2001–2009) administration maintained the hard line approach. In a TV interview in February 2001, Bush&#x27;s new attorney general, John Ashcroft, said about the war on drugs, &quot;I want to renew it. I want to refresh it, relaunch it if you will.&quot; In 2001, after 9/11 and the Patriot Act, the DEA began highlighting the tie between drug trafficking and international terrorism, gaining the agency expanded funding to increase its global presence.

==== Growing dissent ====


In the summer of 2001, a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), &quot;The Drug War is the New Jim Crow&quot;, tied the vastly disproportionate rate of African American incarceration to the range of rights lost once convicted. It stated that, while &quot;whites and blacks use drugs at almost exactly the same rates ... African-Americans are admitted to state prisons at a rate that is 13.4 times greater than whites, a disparity driven largely by the grossly racial targeting of drug laws.&quot; Between federal and state laws, those convicted of even simple possession could lose the right to vote, eligibility for educational assistance including loans and work-study programs, custody of their children, and personal property including homes. The report concluded that the cumulative effect of the war on drugs amounted to &quot;the US apartheid, the new Jim Crow&quot;. This view was further developed by lawyer and civil rights advocate Michelle Alexander in her 2010 book, &quot;The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness&quot;.

In the year 2000, the US drug-control budget reached $18.4 billion, nearly half of which was spent financing law enforcement while only one-sixth was spent on treatment. In the year 2003, 53% of the requested drug control budget was for enforcement, 29% for treatment, and 18% for prevention.

During his presidency, Barack Obama (2009–2017) implemented his &quot;tough but smart&quot; approach to the war on drugs. While he claimed that his method differed from those of previous presidents, in reality, his practices were similar. In May 2009, Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the ONDCPObama&#x27;s drug czarindicated that the Obama administration did not plan to significantly alter drug enforcement policy, but that it would not use the term &quot;war on drugs&quot;, considering it to be &quot;counter-productive&quot;. In August 2010, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law, reducing the 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine to 18:1 for pending and future cases. In 2013, Obama&#x27;s Justice Department issued a policy memorandum known as the Cole Memo, stating that it would defer to state laws that authorize the production, distribution and possession of cannabis, &quot;based on assurances that those states will impose an appropriately strict regulatory system.&quot;

In 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, an international non-governmental group composed primarily of former heads of state and government, and leaders from various sectors, released a report that stated, &quot;The global war on drugs has failed.&quot; It recommended a paradigm shift, to a public health focus, with decriminalization for possession and personal use. Obama&#x27;s ONDCP did not support the report, stating: &quot;Drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated. Making drugs more available ... will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe.&quot;

==== International divisions, state-level changes ====
In May 2012, the ONDCP published &quot;Principles of Modern Drug Policy&quot;, broadly focusing on public health, human rights, and criminal justice reform, while targeting drug traffickers. According to ONDCP director Kerlikowske, drug legalization is not the &quot;silver bullet&quot; solution to drug control, and success is not measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built. That month, a joint statement, &quot;For a humane and balanced drug policy&quot;, was signed by Italy, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the US, promoting a combination of &quot;enforcement to restrict the supply of drugs, with efforts to reduce demand and build recovery.&quot; Meanwhile, at the state level, 2012 saw Colorado and Washington become the first two states to legalize the recreational use of cannabis with the passage of Amendment 64 and Initiative 502 respectively.

A 2013 ACLU report declared the anti-marijuana crusade a &quot;war on people of color&quot;. The report found that &quot;African Americans [were] 3.73 times more likely than whites to be apprehended despite nearly identical usage rates, and marijuana violations accounting for more than half of drug arrests nationwide during the previous decade&quot;. Under Obama&#x27;s policies, nonwhite drug offenders received less excessive criminal sanctions, but by examining criminals as strictly violent or nonviolent, mass incarceration persisted.

In March 2016, the International Narcotics Control Board stated that the UN&#x27;s international drug treaties do not mandate a &quot;war on drugs&quot; and that the choice is not between &quot;&#x27;militarized&#x27; drug law enforcement on one hand and the legalization of non-medical use of drugs on the other&quot;, health and welfare should be the focus of drug policy. That April, the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on the &quot;World Drug Problem&quot; was held. The &quot;Wall Street&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; assessed the attendees&#x27; positions as &quot;somewhat&quot; in two camps: &quot;Some European and South American countries as well as the U.S. favored softer approaches. Eastern countries such as China and Russia and most Muslim nations like Iran, Indonesia and Pakistan remained staunchly opposed.&quot; The outcome document recommended treatment, prevention and other public health measures, and committed to &quot;intensifying our efforts to prevent and counter&quot; drug production and trafficking, through, &quot;inter alia, more effective drug-related crime prevention and law enforcement measures.&quot;

Under President Donald Trump (2017–2021), Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed the previous Justice Department&#x27;s cannabis policies, rescinding the Cole Memo that deferred federal enforcement in states where cannabis had been legalized He instructed federal prosecutors to &quot;charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense&quot; in drug cases, regardless of whether mandatory minimum sentences applied, which could trigger mandatory minimums for lower-level charges. With cannabis legalized to some degree in over 30 states, Sessions&#x27; directive was seen by both Democrats and Republicans as a rogue throwback action, and there was a bipartisan outcry. Trump fired Sessions in 2018 over other issues.

==== Some policy reversal attempts and successes ====
In 2018, Trump signed into law the First Step Act which, among other federal prison reforms, made the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act retroactive. A US Supreme Court decision in 2021 determined that retroactivity applied to cases where mandatory minimum penalties had been imposed.

In 2020, both the ACLU and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Republicans and Democrats were in agreement that it was time to end the war on drugs. While on the presidential campaign trail, President Joe Biden (2021–present) stated that he would take the steps to alleviate the war on drugs and end the opioid epidemic.

On December 4, 2020, during the Trump administration, the House of Representatives passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act), which would decriminalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the list of scheduled substances, expunge past convictions and arrests, and tax cannabis to &quot;reinvest in communities targeted by the war on drugs&quot;. The MORE Act was received in the Senate in December 2020 where it remained. In April 2022, the act was again passed by the House, and awaits Senate action.

Over time, states in the US have approached drug liberalization at a varying pace. Initially, in the 1930s, the states were ahead of the federal government in prohibiting cannabis; in recent decades, the trend has reversed. Beginning with cannabis for medical use in California in 1996, states began to legalize cannabis. , 38 states, four US territories, and the District of Columbia (DC) had legalized cannabis for medical use; for non-medical use, 24 of the states, three territories, and DC, had legalized it, and seven states decriminalized. Decriminalization in this context usually refers to first-time offenses and small quantities, such as, in the case of cannabis, under an ounce (28g). In November 2020, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize a number of drugs, including heroin, methamphetamine, PCP, LSD and oxycodone, shifting from a criminal approach to a public health approach; portions of that policy were reversed in April 2024.

In 2022, Biden signed into law the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, to allow cannabis to be more easily researched for medical purposes. It is the first standalone cannabis reform bill enacted at the federal level. That October, Biden stated on social media, &quot;We classify marijuana at the same level as heroin – and more serious than fentanyl. It makes no sense,&quot; and pledged to start a review by the Attorney General on how cannabis is classified. On October 6, he pardoned all those with federal convictions for simple cannabis possession (to a degree symbolic, as none of those affected were imprisoned at the time), and urged the states, where the large majority of convictions rest, to do the same. His action affected 6,500 people convicted from 1992 to 2021, and thousands convicted in the District of Columbia.

==== Focus on fentanyl ====
In 2023, the US State Department announced plans to launch a &quot;global coalition to address synthetic drug threats&quot;, with more than 80 countries expected to join. That April, Anne Milgram, head of the DEA since 2021, stated to Congress that two Mexican drug cartels posed &quot;the greatest criminal threat the United States has ever faced.&quot; Supporting a DEA budget request of $3.7 billion for 2024, Milgram cited fentanyl in the &quot;most devastating drug crisis in our nation&#x27;s history.&quot;

In January 2024, the DEA confirmed that it was reviewing the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I narcotic. Days later, documents were released from the Department of Health and Human Services stating that cannabis has &quot;a currently accepted medical use&quot; in the US and a &quot;potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in Schedules I and II.&quot; On April 30, indicating a DEA decision, the Justice Department announced, &quot;Today, the Attorney General circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. Once published by the Federal Register, it will initiate a formal rulemaking process as prescribed by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act.&quot; Schedule III drugs, considered to have moderate to low potential for dependence, include ketamine, anabolic steroids, testosterone, and Tylenol with codeine.

In the DEA&#x27;s &quot;National Drug Threat Assessment 2024&quot;, director Milgram outlined the &quot;most dangerous and deadly crisis&quot;, involving synthetic drugs including fentanyl and methamphetamine. She singled out the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in Mexico, which manufacture the synthetics in Mexican labs supplied with precursor chemicals and machinery from China, sell through &quot;vast distribution networks&quot; in the US, and use Chinese money laundering operations to return the proceeds to Mexico. Milgram states, &quot;As the lead law enforcement agency in the Administration&#x27;s whole-of-government response to defeat the Cartels and combat the drug poisoning epidemic in our communities, DEA will continue to collaborate on strategic counterdrug initiatives with our law enforcement partners across the United States and the world.&quot;

==== Focus on counterterrorism ====
In January 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding that various drug cartels and criminal organizations (Sinaloa Cartel, Gulf Cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Northeast Cartel, United Cartels, Tren de Aragua and Mara Salvatrucha) be added to the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists, which was officially enacted on February 20, 2025, making such groups officially terrorist organizations. Similarly, Canada has also joined in designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups.

==Foreign involvement==

US international involvement in drug control rests on the premise that assisting foreign governments in their anti-drug efforts reduces drug supply within the US.

Scholars have claimed that the war on drugs, a metaphorical war, is propaganda cloaking an extension of earlier military or paramilitary operations. Others have argued that large amounts anti-drug foreign aid money, training, and equipment actually goes to fighting leftist insurgencies and is often provided to groups who themselves are involved in large-scale narco-trafficking, such as corrupt members of the Colombian military.

=== UN treaties and US influence ===
The three UN drug control conventions, adopted by over 180 countries, provide a legal framework for cooperation between countries. Each state is obligated to incorporate the treaty provisions in their domestic laws. While there is a degree of interpretative flexibility, &quot;each of the treaties encourages – and often requires – that member countries put in place strong domestic penal provisions&quot; to deal with illicit drugs; punitive policies have been the common approach. The US, emerging as the dominant power after WWII, exerted considerable influence over how the conventions were adopted by other nations, promoting a prohibitionist and criminalizing view. Historically, the US has been &quot;the key player in most multilateral negotiations&quot; and the prohibitionist approach &quot;derives largely from U.S. policy – the various forms, past and present, of the U.S. &#x27;war on drugs&#x27;&quot;.

US economic power is focused on the war on drugs through the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). Enacted in 1961, the FAA integrated various federal foreign aid initiatives under the new US Agency for International Development (USAID), and has remained the core legislation governing foreign financial assistance. In 1972, reacting to concerns over illicit drugs from foreign sources, Congress added an &quot;International Narcotics Control&quot; chapter to the FAA, which allowed the president to enter into agreements and provide assistance for counternarcotic activities in foreign countries. It also made US economic and military aid, including arms sales, dependent on countries aligning with US anti-drug policies. Later, the terms &quot;major illicit drug-producing country&quot; and &quot;major drug-transit country&quot; were defined in the act; as of 1986, the president has been required to annually determine which countries fit those definitions. Those not adequately cooperating with counter-drug efforts would not be eligible to receive US financial aid, although the president could and has provided waivers to individual countries. The so-called &quot;majors list&quot; has influenced how US assistance money is used internationally in the war on drugs, although in recent years, it has remained relatively static and lost a degree of relevancy. In September 2023, President Biden added China to the majors list, citing its production of precursor chemicals.

Foreign anti-drug initiatives initially focused on Latin America, and expanded globally over time. Since the 1970s, billions of US aid dollars have been directed to anti-drug activity in Latin America. The US initially treated drug control as a law enforcement issue in foreign countries, providing assistance to police forces. In the 1980s, the US increasingly involved the military and private security firms, to provide training and support to armed forces in drug-producing and transit countries. , the DEA has, in addition to 241 domestic offices, 93 foreign offices in 69 countries. In addition to numerous cooperative law enforcement actions worldwide against drug trafficking and money laundering, the DEA and other agencies, and the US military, have been involved in multi-year foreign drug campaigns, including in Colombia, Mexico and Afghanistan.

=== Latin America ===
In 2021, Gustavo Gorriti, journalist and founder of corruption-focused &quot;IDL-Reporteros&quot; news media, wrote a sharply critical editorial in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; on the impact of 50 years of the war on drugs on Latin America. He described the flow of drugs to the US as an &quot;unstoppable industry&quot; that triggered an economic revolution throughout the region, where the illegal drug trade with its high profit margins far exceeded the potential of legitimate businesses. Corruption among politicians and anti-drug forces soared, even as those in charge were &quot;cultivating close relationships with U.S. enforcement and intelligence agencies.&quot; An underclass of poor farmers became economic hostages, depending on drug crops for their survival. The big winners were &quot;the systems built to wage a fight that they soon realized would have no end. ... [The war on drugs] became a source for endless resources, inflated budgets, contracts, purchase orders, power, influence – new economies battling drug trafficking but also dependent on it.&quot;

At a meeting in Guatemala in 2012, three former presidents from Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia said that the war on drugs had failed and that they would propose a discussion on alternatives, including decriminalization, at the Summit of the Americas in April of that year. Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina said that the war on drugs was exacting too high a price on the lives of Central Americans and that it was time to &quot;end the taboo on discussing decriminalization&quot;. At the summit, the government of Colombia pushed for far-reaching changes to drugs policy, citing the catastrophic effects of the war on drugs in Colombia.

==== Colombia ====
Historically, the illicit drug trade in Colombia had strong connections to right-wing paramilitaries like the United Self-Defenders of Colombia (AUC) and leftist guerilla groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), thus US anti-drug efforts in the country overlapped with support for counterinsurgency efforts. In the late 1960s, when drug smuggling to the US from Mexico rose to a major scale, the two governments cooperated in the launch of the Mexican war on drugs; the market disruption gave Colombian traffickers an opportunity to fill US demand for cannabis.

Until the 1970s, Colombia &quot;had played no major role in the production and circulation of illegal drugs in the hemisphere&quot;. After a military coup in Chile in 1973 and the spread of political repression through the Southern Cone countries disrupted cocaine smuggling from Peru and Bolivia, Colombia stepped in to fill the demand for cocaine. Pressed by the US, the Colombian government, under president Misael Pastrana (1970–1974), worked with the newly formed DEA to establish the future path for the country&#x27;s war on drugs.

During the 1970s, the &quot;marijuana boom&quot; dominated Colombia&#x27;s drug trade, peaking mid-decade. That soon gave way to cocaine and the rise of the infamous Medellin and Cali cartels that grew through the 1980s and early 1990s to dominate the global cocaine market. By the end of the century, the brutal anti-drug war left the security situation in Colombia in critical condition. Through the Plan Colombia program, between 2000 and 2015, the US provided Colombia with $10 billion in funding, primarily for military aid, training, and equipment, to fight both drugs and left-wing guerrillas such as FARC (which had been accused of participation in drug trafficking).

The Clinton administration initially waived all but one of the human rights conditions attached to Plan Colombia, considering such aid as crucial to national security at the time. Private US military contractors, including the former DynCorp, were contracted by the State and Defense Departments, to carry out anti-drug initiatives as part of Plan Colombia. Colombian military personnel received extensive counterinsurgency training from US military and law enforcement agencies, including the School of Americas (SOA). US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in multiple massacres during the 1990s, including the Trujillo Massacre and the 1997 Mapiripán Massacre.

The efforts of the US and Colombian governments have been criticized for focusing on fighting leftist guerrillas in southern regions without applying enough pressure on right-wing paramilitaries and continuing drug smuggling operations in the north of the country. Human Rights Watch, congressional committees and other entities have documented connections between members of the Colombian military and the AUC, which the US government has listed as a terrorist group, and that Colombian military personnel have committed human rights abuses which would make them ineligible for US aid under current laws.

Coca eradication by aerial spraying of herbicides such as glyphosate was a controversial element of Plan Colombia. Environmental consequences resulting from spraying have been criticized as detrimental to some of the world&#x27;s most fragile ecosystems; the same spraying practices are further credited with causing health problems in local populations.

A report by the RAND Corporation, examining the Colombian experience for insights applicable to the Mexican drug war, noted that &quot;Plan Colombia has been widely hailed as a success, and some analysts believe that, by 2010, Colombian security forces had finally gained the upper hand once and for all.&quot; The report cited dramatic reductions in kidnappings and terrorist acts, and the recapture of territory, attributed to &quot;a reinforced military and reinvigorated police force.&quot; It also found that, as of 2010, &quot;Colombia is still a major source country for illicit narcotics. Moreover, the state continues to share sovereignty with a range of violent nonstate actors, including rebel groups and rightwing paramilitaries allied with drug traffickers and wealthy landowners.&quot; The Washington Office on Latin America concluded in 2010 that both Plan Colombia and the Colombian government&#x27;s security strategy &quot;came at a high cost in lives and resources, only did part of the job, are yielding diminishing returns and have left important institutions weaker.&quot;

==== Mexico ====

One of the first anti-drug efforts in the realm of foreign policy was Nixon&#x27;s Operation Intercept, announced in September 1969, aiming to severely reduce the amount of cannabis entering the US from Mexico, by government estimates the source of 80% of the US supply. The effort began with an intense inspection crackdown that resulted in a near shutdown of cross-border traffic. The US Air Force and Navy were also on alert to pursue traffickers in the air and at sea. The burden on border crossings was controversial in border states; the effort lasted only 20 days.

The Mérida Initiative, launched in 2008, was a security cooperation program between the US and Mexico, aimed at combating drug trafficking and transnational crime. From 2008 to 2021, the US provided $3.5 billion in funding. The initial focus was anti-drug and rule-of-law measures, later broadened to include US-Mexico border activities. Components included military and law enforcement training and equipment, and technical advice and training to strengthen the national justice systems. In 2021, it was replaced by the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities.

In 2013, a Pew Research Center poll found that 85% of Mexican citizens supported using the Mexican army against drug cartels, 74% supported US training assistance for their police and military, 55% supported the US supplying of weapons and financial aid, and 59% were against deploying US troops on Mexican soil. Anti-drug efforts were seen as making progress by 37%, losing ground by 29%, and staying the same by 30%; 56% believed that the US and Mexico are both to blame for drug violence in Mexico.

, the DEA considers the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, tied to materials and services from China, as the major source of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine, posing the biggest threat to the US.

==== Central America ====
The countries of Central America – Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama – are major transit and storage points for drugs headed to Mexico and the US that annually appear on the American &quot;majors list&quot;. The US has had varying levels of direct anti-drug involvement in each of these countries, particularly since the late 2000s when concern over trafficking activity increased. Beginning in 2008, the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) has provided the seven countries with equipment, training, and technical support for law enforcement efforts, and the US has advised taking an intelligence-based approach.

During the 1980s civil war in Nicaragua, the drug situation was intertwined with the US backing of the anti-leftist rebel force known as the Contras. Senator John Kerry&#x27;s 1988 Senate Committee on Foreign Relations report on Contra drug links concluded that members of the State Department &quot;who provided support for the Contras are involved in drug trafficking ... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly receive financial and material assistance from drug traffickers.&quot; The involvement included payments to drug traffickers from funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.&quot;
On December 20, 1989, the US invaded Panama with 25,000 American troops in Operation Just Cause, to depose and arrest the Panamanian head of government, Manuel Noriega. Noriega had been providing military assistance to Contra groups in Nicaragua at the request of the US, which in turn paid him and tolerated his drug trafficking activities, known since the 1960s. Relations with the US deteriorated in the mid-1980s, and his dealings with the US government were exposed in the US news media. The killing of a US soldier in Panama was the final act leading to the invasion. Noriega surrendered to US soldiers on January 3, 1990. He was indicted by the DEA and sentenced by a US court to 45 years in prison for racketeering, drug smuggling, and money laundering. The UN General Assembly resolved that the invasion was a &quot;flagrant violation of international law.&quot;

Ecuador, located between the world&#x27;s two largest cocaine-producing countries, Colombia and Peru,has long been a major drug transit point. From 1999, the Manta air base was the US military&#x27;s most prominent South American presence, originating some 100 drug surveillance flights monthly. In 2009, citing unwanted internal influence by the CIA, Ecuador declined to renew the base&#x27;s lease, ending official US military presence. Since 2018, drug activity and anti-drug efforts in Ecuador have dramatically intensified. In 2023, the US-Ecuador Defense Bilateral Working Group was formed to address the Ecuadorian situation, and a memorandum of agreement to help strengthen the Ecuadorian military was signed. A drug-related wider conflict broke out in 2024.

In 2012, the US sent DEA agents to Honduras to assist security forces in counternarcotic operations. Honduras has been a major stop for drug traffickers, who use small planes and landing strips hidden throughout the country to transport drugs. The DEA, working with other US agencies such as the State Department, the CBP, and Joint Task Force-Bravo, assisted Honduran troops in conducting raids on traffickers&#x27; sites of operation.

==== Impact on growers ====
The US-supported coca eradication policy has been criticized for its negative impact on the livelihood of South American coca growers, in a region where the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed and used in tea and for religious, medicinal and nutritional purposes by locals Making traditional coca cultivation illegal is viewed as unjust. In areas where forced eradication also destroyed other food or market crops, without providing an alternative, farmers were left starving and destitute.
=== Afghanistan ===

In 2001, a US-led military coalition invaded Afghanistan and toppled the ruling Taliban as part of the war on terror response to 9/11. For generations, Afghanistan had been producing opium; the Taliban, in power since 1996, banned opium in 2000, reducing domestic production by 90% within a year, cutting the world opium supply by an estimated 65%. With the invasion, poppy cultivation and opium manufacture resumed, and the war on drugs became an element of the US presence.

Initially, &quot;everyone did their own thing, not thinking how it fit in with the larger effort. State was trying to eradicate, USAID was marginally trying to do livelihoods, and DEA was going after bad guys,&quot; a senior Department of Defense official stated in a later report. In 2004, opium production dramatically increased and eradication became the focus. The DEA operating budget in Afghanistan grew from $3.7 million in 2004 to $40.6 million in 2008. In 2009, eradication was halteda senior US official called it &quot;the least effective program ever&quot;in favor of an &quot;alternative livelihoods&quot; approach that encouraged farmers to grow other crops. In 2017, eradication once again became the main initiative; the US military launched an aerial campaign involving B-52 bombers and F-22 fighters striking a network of drug labs that turned out to be mostly empty compounds, though there were significant civilian casualties.

Undermining US efforts, the prohibitionist policies encouraged a flourishing opium black market, which in turn incentivized widespread, systemic corruption in the Afghan government. In 2018, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction called the counternarcotics operation to date &quot;a total failure&quot;. As the US military presence neared an end in 2020, Afghanistan was producing an estimated 85% of the world&#x27;s opium. Having spent some $9 billion in the 20-year anti-drug campaign, US forces left Afghanistan in 2021, and the Taliban returned to power.

=== China ===

In the mid-2010s, the US identified China as a primary source of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. American anti-drug intervention regarding China is influenced and constrained by the geopolitical sensitivities of US-China relations. The US employs several approaches: exerting diplomatic pressure on China to impose internal controls on illicit drugs; seeking cooperation in US and international law enforcement efforts; unilaterally imposing targeted sanctions; and bringing criminal indictments against Chinese companies and individuals. The effectiveness of these approaches depends significantly on China&#x27;s level of implementation and enforcement, which is directly related to the fluctuating state of overall US-China relations.

Following China&#x27;s scheduling of fentanyl-class substances in 2019, the flow of synthetic opioids from China to the US appeared to subside; trafficking from China shifted to precursor chemicals and related equipment, and Mexico&#x27;s drug cartels emerged as major clients.

In November 2023, President Biden announced an agreement with General Secretary Xi Jinping for China to crack down on the export of precursor chemicals and pill presses to the Western Hemisphere. A US House committee report released in April 2024 found companies making fentanyl precursors in China can still apply for Chinese state tax rebates and other financial benefits after exporting the product. According to the US, in 2024, China continues to be the primary supplier of chemical precursors to Mexican drug cartels, and Chinese money launderers have become central to the global drug trade.

In December 2024, a Chinese national in Chicago was sentenced to 10 years in prison laundering $62 million in drug money for Mexican traffickers involving currency swaps between United States and China, and China and Mexico. In January 2025, two former executives of a Chinese chemical company were convicted of a scheme to import fentanyl precursor chemicals into the United States.

== Domestic impact ==

The social consequences of the drug war have been widely criticized by such organizations as the ACLU as being racially biased against minorities and disproportionately responsible for the exploding United States prison population. Critics have compared the wholesale incarceration of the dissenting minority of drug users to the wholesale incarceration of other minorities in history. Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz wrote in 1997, &quot;Over the past thirty years, we have replaced the medical-political persecution of illegal sex users (&#x27;perverts&#x27; and &#x27;psychopaths&#x27;) with the even more ferocious medical-political persecution of illegal drug users.&quot; Assessing from a health perspective, a study in the &quot;Annals of Medicine&quot; noted: &quot;The U.S. war on drugs has subjected millions to criminalisation, incarceration, and lifelong criminal records, disrupting or altogether eliminating their access to adequate resources and supports to live healthy lives.&quot;

=== Arrest and incarceration ===

The war on drugs caused soaring arrest rates in the US that disproportionately targeted African Americans due to various factors. Anti-drug and tough-on-crime policies from the 1970s through the 1990s created a situation where the US, with less than 5% of the world population, houses nearly 25% of the world&#x27;s prisoners. Increased demand lead to the development of privatization and the for-profit prison industry. , the US prison population rate was 716 per 100,000 people, the highest in the world, six times higher than Canada and six to nine times higher than Western European countries.
In the 1980s, while the number of arrests for all crimes had risen by 28%, the number of arrests for drug offenses rose 126%. In 1994, the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; reported that the war on drugs resulted in the incarceration of one million Americans each year. In 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that of 1.5 million Americans arrested each year for drug offenses, half a million would be incarcerated, and one in five black Americans would spend time behind bars due to drug laws. In 2019, the FBI estimated about 1.5 million drug arrests nationally, 32.1% for cannabis and 31% for &quot;other dangerous nonnarcotic drugs&quot;.

Federal and state policies also impose collateral consequences on those convicted of drug offenses, separate from fines and prison time, that are not applicable to other types of crime. In order to comply with a federal law known as the Solomon–Lautenberg amendment, a number of states require a six-months driver&#x27;s license suspension for anyone convicted of a drug offense. Other examples of collateral consequences for drug offenses, or for felony offenses in general, include loss of professional license, loss of ability to legally purchase a firearm under Federal law, loss of eligibility for food stamps, loss of eligibility for Federal Student Aid, loss of eligibility to live in public housing, loss of ability to vote, and deportation, a total of over 460 benefits at risk at the federal level alone. The US provides for the deportation of non-citizens convicted of drug offenses.

==== Prison overcrowding ====
One consequence of the war on drugs policy has been the overcrowding of American prisons. The policy&#x27;s approach to prosecuting drug-related crimes led to a surge in incarcerated individuals for nonviolent drug offenses. As a result, many prisons have become overburdened, often operating at capacities far beyond their intended limits. Overcrowding strains the prison system and raises questions about the effectiveness of incarceration as a solution to drug-related issues. Resources that could be allocated to address the root causes of drug abuse, provide rehabilitation and treatment programs, or support communities affected by drug-related issues, are instead used to manage the considerable prison population. Critics argue that focusing solely on incarceration fails to address the underlying social factors contributing to drug abuse and perpetuates a cycle of criminality without offering pathways to recovery and reintegration into society.

==== Racial disparities in sentencing ====

Racial disparities have been a prominent and contentious aspect of the war on drugs in the US. In 1957, a belief at the time about drug use was summarized by journalist Max Lerner in his work, &quot;America as a Civilization&quot;: &quot;As a case in point we may take the known fact of the prevalence of reefer and dope addiction in Negro areas. This is essentially explained in terms of poverty, slum living, and broken families, yet it would be easy to show the lack of drug addiction among other ethnic groups where the same conditions apply.&quot;

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 created a 100:1 sentencing disparity in the US for the trafficking or possession of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine. The bill had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine. In 1994, studying the effects of the 100:1 sentencing ratio, the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) found that nearly two-thirds of crack users were white or Hispanic, while nearly 85% of those convicted for possession were black, with similar numbers for trafficking. Powder cocaine offenders were more equally divided across race. The USSC noted that these disparities resulted in African Americans serving longer prison sentences than other ethnicities. In a 1995 report to Congress, the USSC recommended against the 100:1 sentencing ratio. In 2010, the 100:1 sentencing ratio was reduced to 18:1.

Other studies indicated similarly dramatic racial differences in enforcement and sentencing. Statistics from 1998 show that there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes. Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races, even though they supposedly constituted only 13% of regular drug users. Human Rights Watch&#x27;s report, &quot;Race and the Drug War&quot; (2000), provided extensive documentation of racial disparities, citing statistics and case studies highlighting the unequal treatment of racial and ethnic groups by law enforcement agencies, particularly in drug arrests. According to the report, in the US in 1999, compared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.

Reporting on the effects of state initiatives, the Department of Justice found that, from 1990 through 2000, &quot;the increasing number of drug offenses accounted for 27% of the total growth among black inmates, 7% of the total growth among Hispanic inmates, and 15% of the growth among white inmates.&quot;

In &quot;Malign Neglect – Race Crime and Punishment in America&quot; (1995), criminologist Michael Tonry wrote, &quot;The War on Drugs foreseeably and unnecessarily blighted the lives of hundreds and thousands of young disadvantaged black Americans and undermined decades of effort to improve the life chances of members of the urban black underclass.&quot;

==== Permanent underclass creation ====

Penalties for drug crimes among American youth almost always involve permanent or semi-permanent removal from opportunities for education, strip them of voting rights, and later involve creation of criminal records which make employment more difficult. One-fifth of the US prison population are incarcerated for a drug offence. Thus, some authors maintain that the War on Drugs has resulted in the creation of a permanent underclass of people who have few educational or job opportunities, often as a result of being punished for drug offenses which in turn have resulted from attempts to earn a living in spite of having no education or job opportunities.

In her 2010 book, &quot;The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness&quot;, Michelle Alexander argues that the war on drugs has effectively perpetuated a racial caste system, with African American and Hispanic individuals experiencing disproportionately high rates of arrest, conviction, and incarceration for drug-related offenses. This system functions as a modern form of racial control, stripping individuals of their rights and opportunities, and reinforcing societal inequalities. According to Alexander, the consequences extend beyond criminal justice, affecting economic opportunities, access to education, and overall social mobility for affected individuals and communities.

=== Drug testing in the workplace ===
Workplace drug testing has been widespread and controversial in the US since the late 1980s: there is no clear measure of its effectiveness in improving safety and productivity, and testing affects significantly more non-whites than whites. Testing is more prevalent in the US than elsewhere in the world. Most common is urine analysis for amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, opioids and PCP; usually with no practical discrimination between the effects of the different drugs. Workplace testing rapidly gained popularity after the Reagan administration made it mandatory for federal workers, peaking in 1996, with 81% of companies reporting drug screening, up from 21% in 1987.

In the 1980s, testing had been promoted to business as a way to reclaim what were said to be huge losses in productivity caused by drug use. Studies released in the 1990s refuted these claims; a 1994 report from the National Academy of Sciences, &quot;Under the Influence? Drugs and the American Work Force&quot;, concluded that &quot;the data... do not provide clear evidence of the deleterious effects of drugs other than alcohol on safety and other job performance indicators.&quot; By 2004, workplace testing was down to 62% of companies, in 2015, it was reported as below 50%. Drug use continues to be blamed for productivity losses, and testing remains common.

In 2021, some companies began to reduce drug testing in order to improve hiring prospects in a tight labor market. Amazon, America&#x27;s second largest employer, eliminated cannabis testing in job pre-screening, where not required by government regulations, stating, &quot;Pre-employment marijuana testing has disproportionately affected communities of color by stalling job placement.&quot; In a survey of 45,000 companies worldwide, 9% reported the elimination of testing in order to improve hiring. In 2022, thousands of US truck drivers were taken off the road after testing positive for cannabis, contributing to a severe driver shortage; a conflict between the majority of states with some form of cannabis legalization, and the federal Department of Transportation&#x27;s zero-tolerance cannabis policy, even for medical use, is cited as a problem.

=== Public opinion ===
In the 21st century, according to polling, a majority of Americans have been skeptical about the methods and effectiveness of the war on drugs. In 2014, a Pew Research Center poll found that 67% of Americans feel that a movement towards treatment for drugs like cocaine and heroin is better versus 26% who feel that prosecution is the better route. Moving away from mandatory prison terms for drug crimes was favored by two-thirds of the population, a substantial shift from a fifty-fifty split in 2001. A large majority saw alcohol as a greater danger to health (69%) and society (63%) than cannabis. In Gallup polls on whether cannabis should be legal, 15% of Americans agreed in March 1972, rising to 28% in April 1977, where it roughly stayed until 2000, when it began rising again, to 68% in October 2021. In May 2021, a Bully Pulpit Interactive/ACLU poll found that 83% of Americans, across party lines, considered the war on drugs a failure, and 12% considered it a success.

=== Legality ===
The legality of drug prohibition within the US has been challenged on various grounds. One argument holds that drug prohibition, as presently implemented, violates the substantive due process doctrine in that its benefits do not justify the encroachments on rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. Another argument interprets the Commerce Clause to mean that drugs should be regulated in state law not federal law. A third argument states that the reverse burden of proof in drug-possession cases is incompatible with the rule of law, in that the power to convict is effectively taken from the courts and given to those who are willing to plant evidence.

== Efficacy ==
There is no clear measure of the effectiveness of the war on drugs, and it has been widely called a policy failure. Thirty years into the campaign, a National Research Council report, &quot;Informing America&#x27;s Policy on Illegal Drugs&quot; (2001), found that &quot;existing drug-use monitoring systems are strikingly inadequate to support the full range of policy decisions that the nation must make.&quot; The report noted that studies of efforts to address drug usage and smuggling, from US military operations to eradicate coca fields in Colombia, to domestic drug treatment centers, had all been inconclusive, if the programs had been evaluated at all: It concluded, &quot;It is unconscionable for this country to continue to carry out a public policy of this magnitude and cost without any way of knowing whether and to what extent it is having the desired effect.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;New Statesmen&quot; in 2021, journalist James Bloodworth stated, &quot;The war on drugs is a failure. We know this. We&#x27;ve long known it. In fact, there is such an abundance of evidence for its failure that we have more certainty here than in most areas of policy. ... According to the International Drug Policy Consortium there was a 31 per cent global increase in drug taking between 2011 and 2016. ... It is impossible to suppress the demand for drugs.&quot; He quoted Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand and head of the Global Commission on Drug Policy: &quot;The total elimination of drugs? Dream on, there&#x27;s never been a time in human history where human beings haven&#x27;t resorted to some kind of substances that will take them out of their current reality for whatever reason.&quot;

=== Interdiction ===

In 1988, the RAND Corporation released a Department of Defense-funded two-year study, &quot;Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction&quot;. It concluded that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the US would have little or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. It noted that seven prior studies, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions.

In mid-1995, the US government tried to reduce the supply of methamphetamine precursors to disrupt the market of this drug. According to a 2009 study, this effort was successful, but its effects were largely temporary.

In the six years from 2000 to 2006, the US spent $4.7 billion on Plan Colombia, an effort to eradicate coca production in Colombia. The main result of this effort was to shift coca production into more remote areas and force other forms of adaptation. The overall acreage cultivated for coca in Colombia at the end of the six years was found to be the same, after the US Drug Czar&#x27;s office announced a change in measuring methodology in 2005 and included new areas in its surveys. Cultivation in the neighboring countries of Peru and Bolivia increased, some would describe this effect like squeezing a balloon.

Richard Davenport-Hines, in his book &quot;The Pursuit of Oblivion&quot;, criticized the efficacy of the war on drugs by pointing out that &quot;10–15% of illicit heroin and 30% of illicit cocaine is intercepted. Drug traffickers have gross profit margins of up to 300%. At least 75% of illicit drug shipments would have to be intercepted before the traffickers&#x27; profits were hurt.&quot;

Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, described US foreign drug policy as &quot;failed&quot;: &quot;For 10 years, there has been a considerable sum invested by the Peruvian government and another sum on the part of the American government, and this has not led to a reduction in the supply of coca leaf offered for sale. Rather, in the 10 years from 1980 to 1990, it grew 10-fold.&quot;

According to a report commissioned by the Drug Policy Alliance, and released in March 2006 by the Justice Policy Institute, harsher sentences for drug offenses committed in drug-free school zones are ineffective at keeping youths away from drugs and instead create strong racial disparities in the judicial system.

According to data collected by the Federal Bureau of Prisons 45.3% of all criminal charges were drug related and 25.5% of sentences for all charges last 5–10 years. Furthermore, non-whites make up 41.4% of the federal prison system&#x27;s population and over half are under the age of 40. The Bureau of Justice Statistics states that over 80% of all drug related charges are for mere possession rather than the sale or manufacture of drugs.

=== Drug use ===
In 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future annual survey reported about 85% of high school seniors found marijuana &quot;easy to obtain&quot;, virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys. The DEA stated that the number of users of cannabis in the US declined between 2000 and 2005, even with many states passing new medical cannabis laws, making access easier, though usage rates remain higher than they were in the 1990s according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

The ONDCP stated in April 2011 that there had been a 46% drop in cocaine use among young adults over the previous five years, and a 65% drop in the rate of people testing positive for cocaine in the workplace since 2006. At the same time, a 2007 study found that up to 35% of college undergraduates used stimulants not prescribed to them.

A 2013 study found that prices of heroin, cocaine and cannabis had decreased from 1990 to 2007, while the purity of these drugs had increased.

The National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 2019 found that 1.7% of US adults over 25 had used cocaine in the previous 12 months, compared to 1.8% in 2002, and cannabis use went from 7% in 2002 to 15.2%. The DEA&#x27;s 2021 National Drug Threat Assessment stated that &quot;a steady supply of cocaine was available throughout domestic markets&quot; in 2019 and 2020.

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), drug abuse fatalities in 2021 reached an all-time high of 108,000 deaths, a 15% increase from 2020 (93,000) which, at the time, was the highest number of deaths and a 30% increase from 2019.

During alcohol prohibition, from 1920 to 1933, alcohol use initially fell but began to increase as early as 1922. It has been extrapolated that even if prohibition had not been repealed in 1933, alcohol consumption would have surpassed pre-prohibition levels. One argument against the war on drugs is that it uses similar measures as Prohibition and is no more effective.

=== Government efficiency ===
In 1997, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published a comprehensive snapshot of the US government&#x27;s implementation of the war on drugs, spanning 44 federal agencies and hundreds of thousands of government workers, and without unified management, oversight, or cohesive strategy. Among the agencies there were over a dozen separate drug intelligence operations. The White House&#x27;s Office of National Drug Control Policy, home of the drug czar and ostensibly the coordinating agency, had a staff of 150, and a $36 million budget; the overall federal drug war budget for 1998 was $16 billion. Most of the agencies involved did not report to the ONDCP, instead to one of 13 congressional appropriations subcommittees. The largest single share of the budget, $2 billion, went to the Bureau of Prisons. Federal agencies also passed on billions of anti-drug dollars to the states, with little oversight or accountability. In 2024, the ONDCP requested $461 million of a $46 billion federal budget allocated across some 50 federal agencies.

==Alternatives==

Alternatives to the predominantly punitive, law enforcement approach to the war on drugs in the US fall under two broad categories: a public health orientation built around education, prevention and treatment, and decriminalization or legalization with regulation similar to the handling of alcohol. Jefferson Fish has edited scholarly collections of articles offering a wide variety of public health-based and rights-based alternative drug policies.

=== A public-health approach ===
A common critical view holds that the war on drugs has been costly and ineffective largely because US federal and state governments have chosen the wrong methods, focusing on interdiction and punishment rather than regulation and treatment of drug abuse and addiction. In the US, current public health-oriented interventions include harm reduction, drug courts, and Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) programs which give police treatment or social services options rather than arrest with minor drug offenses. Harm reduction approaches include provision of sterile syringes, medically supervised injection sites (SIF), and availability of the opioid overdose-countering drug naloxone.

As an alternative to imprisonment, drug courts in the US identify substance-abusing offenders and place them under strict court monitoring and community supervision, as well as provide them with long-term treatment services. According to a National Drug Court Institute report, 16.4% of the nation&#x27;s drug court graduates are rearrested and charged with a felony within one year of completing the program; overall 44.1% of released prisoners end up back in prison within one year. The drug court program is also significantly cheaper than imprisonment. Annual per offender cost is $20,000–$50,000 for imprisonment, and $2,500–$4,000 in the drug court system.

A survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that substance abusers who remain in treatment longer are less likely to resume their former drug habits. Of the people studied, 66% were cocaine users. After experiencing long-term in-patient treatment, only 22% returned to the use of cocaine.

During the 1990s, the Clinton administration commissioned a major cocaine policy study by the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. The report recommended that $3 billion be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment, concluding that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use, and twenty-three times more effective than the supply-side war on drugs.

=== Decriminalization and legalization ===
In a 2023 UN report, the UN high commissioner for Human Rights stated that &quot;decades of punitive, &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; strategies had failed to prevent an increasing range and quantity of substances from being produced and consumed&quot;, described punitive drug policies as a failure, and called for an approach &quot;based on health and human rights, including through the legal regulation of drugs.&quot;

Considering outright legalization of recreational drugs, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Eduardo Porter noted: Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard who studies drug policy closely, has suggested that legalizing all illicit drugs would produce net benefits to the United States of some $65 billion a year, mostly by cutting public spending on enforcement as well as through reduced crime and corruption. A study by analysts at the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, suggested that if marijuana were legalized in California and the drug spilled from there to other states, Mexican drug cartels would lose about a fifth of their annual income of some $6.5 billion from illegal exports to the United States.

In 2007, &quot;An Open Letter to the President, Congress, Governors, and State Legislatures&quot; signed by over 550 economists, including Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, George Akerlof and Vernon L. Smith, endorsed the findings of a 2006 paper, &quot;The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition,&quot; by Harvard economist Jeffrey A. Miron. Comparing the cost of prohibition to the tax revenue if cannabis was taxed as regular consumer good, or similarly to alcohol, the letter stated that the budgetary impact, considered alongside evidence that &quot;suggests prohibition has minimal benefits and may itself cause substantial harm&quot;, favors &quot;a regime in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other goods.&quot; According to a 2010 report on co-authored by Miron, the annual savings on enforcement and incarceration costs from the legalization of drugs would amount to roughly $41.3 billion, with $25.7 billion being saved among the states and over $15.6 billion accrued for the federal government. Miron further estimated at least $46.7 billion in tax revenue based on rates comparable to those on tobacco and alcohol: $8.7 billion from marijuana, $32.6 billion from cocaine and heroin, and $5.4 billion from other drugs.

Regarding economic arguments for legalization that make a comparison with alcohol, a 2013 study noted that the $14.6 billion in annual alcohol tax collected at the US federal and state levels represented less than 10% of the estimated $185 billion of alcohol-related health care, criminal justice and lost productivity costs.

<text>Bebenhausen is a village (pop. 347) in the Tübingen district, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Since 1974 it is a district of the city of Tübingen, its least populous one. It is located 3 km north of Tübingen proper (about 5 km northeast of the city centre), in the southeastern part of the protected landscape of the Schönbuch, a dense forest. Bebenhausen is famous for its monastery, Bebenhausen Abbey, founded in 1183 by Count Palatine Rudolph of Tübingen.

In the early 19th century the monastery became a hunting palace for the kings of Württemberg. King William II of Württemberg lived there until his death in 1921, his wife Princess Charlotte of Schaumburg-Lippe until her death in 1946. It became the seat of Württemberg-Hohenzollern from 1947 and until 1952 when Baden-Württemberg was created. In 1974, Bebenhausen became a district of Tübingen.

<doc id="1181649" wikidata="Q2630069" url="?curid=1181649" title="Recorder of deeds">
<text>Recorder of deeds or deeds registry is a government office tasked with maintaining public records and documents, especially records relating to real estate ownership that provide persons other than the owner of a property with real rights over that property.

==Background==
The offices with similar duties (varying by jurisdiction) include registrar general, register of deeds, registrar of deeds, registrar of titles. The office of such an official may be referred to as the deeds registry or deeds office. In the United States, the recorder of deeds is often an elected county office and is called the county recorder. In some U.S. states, the functions of a recorder of deeds are a responsibility of the county clerk (or the county&#x27;s clerk of court), and the official may be called a clerk-recorder or recorder-clerk.

The recorder of deeds provides a single location in which records of real property rights are recorded and may be researched by interested parties. The record of deeds often maintains documents regularly recorded by the recorder of deeds, including deeds, mortgages, mechanic&#x27;s liens, releases and plats, among others. To allow full access to deeds recorded throughout the office history, several indexes may be maintained, which include grantor–grantee indexes, tract indexes, and plat maps. Storage methods to record registry entries include paper, microform, and computer.

The principles of statutory, case, and common law are given effect by the recorder of deeds, insofar as it relates to vested ownership in land and other real rights. Because estate in land can be held in so many complex ways, a single deeds registry provides some clarity, even though it cannot &quot;guarantee&quot; those real property rights.

The legal certainty provided by a title deed issued under the registration of the recorder of deeds is of great significance to all parties who hold, or wish to acquire rights in real property. Certainty of title is the basis for the investment of massive amounts of money in real estate development for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural use each year. This is why the meticulous recording of registration information by the recorder of deeds is so important.

Each document recorded against title to real estate can be examined and the portion of the bundle of rights that it includes can be determined. These records can assist interested parties in researching the history of land and the chain of title for any property and purpose.

==Philippines: Registry of Deeds==
The Registry of Deeds exists in almost all cities and municipalities in the Philippines and it has a primary duty of registering and keeping all documents pertaining to transfer of real property and issuance of certificates of land title, whether original, transfer or condominium as well as chattel mortgage papers. The said agency is under the supervision of the Land Registration Authority, Department of Justice.

==South Africa: Deeds Registry==
The South African system of deeds registry is unique in that it is associated with tenure security. When conveyancers transfer title, they are expected to follow rigid procedures which involve ensuring the title and the property comply with all the relevant legislation and regulations, leading to a high degree of certainty and accuracy. Recent concerns about the standard of legal education in South Africa, however, has raised concerns about whether this is still the case. The South African Registrar of Deeds is responsible for the national system of deeds offices which, through a juristic foundation and long-standing practices and procedures, has the effect of “guaranteeing” title.

The Deeds Registries Act and Sectional Titles Act are applied to regulate the deeds registry system, and form the foundation of land registration in South Africa.

==United States: Recorders of Deeds==
In the U.S., most recorders of deeds are elected officials who serve the area of a county or equivalent jurisdiction.

In some states, the recorder of deeds may also act as a public posting place for documents that are not directly related to estates in land, such as corporate charters, military discharges, Uniform Commercial Code records, applications for marriage licenses, and judgments.

Deeds in a few states of the U.S. are maintained under the Torrens title system or some limited implementation of it. (For example: Minnesota, some property in Massachusetts, Colorado, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.)

Other U.S. states maintain their deeds under the common law system of record title. Typically, they are filed in chronological order with a grantor/grantee index.

He played college football for the Illinois Fighting Illini, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft. Lloyd also played for the Washington Redskins, Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, St. Louis Rams and New England Patriots.

==College career==
Lloyd attended the University of Illinois, and played for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team beginning in 1999. After a promising freshman season, Lloyd missed all of the 2000 season with a broken femur. He returned healthily and had outstanding seasons in both 2001 and 2002. He was a consensus first-team All-Big Ten performer after his sophomore season in 2001, helping lead the Fighting Illini to a 10–2 record and a BCS berth in the 2002 Sugar Bowl against LSU.

After his junior season in 2002, Lloyd declared his eligibility for the NFL Draft. Of the seven children in the Lloyd family, he was the only one who started a career without finishing college. According to Brandon, &quot;I saw [my mom] cry was when I told her I wasn&#x27;t going back to school. She just thought that was the end of everything.&quot;

Lloyd finished his college career having the second-most receiving yards (2,835) and touchdown catches (31) in Illinois history, and ranking third in all-time receptions (160).

==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers (first stint)===
Lloyd was drafted in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft with the 124th overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers. In his first game, he blocked a punt against the Chicago Bears on September 7, 2003. On November 2, 2003, he caught his first touchdown pass against the St. Louis Rams. He finished the season with 14 receptions for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns.

In 2004, Lloyd started and appeared in 13 games and finished the season with 43 catches for 565 yards and six touchdowns.

During the 2005 season, Lloyd started 15 games and had 48 receptions 733 yards receiving and had five touchdowns. In Week 3against the Dallas Cowboys, he recorded four catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns, including an 89-yard touchdown catch.

===Washington Redskins===
On Saturday March 11, 2006, the San Francisco 49ers traded Lloyd to Washington Redskins in exchange for a third-round draft pick in the 2006 NFL draft and a fourth-round pick in the 2007 NFL draft. His first season in Washington is widely considered a failure, as he caught 23 passes for no touchdowns. According to Howard Bryant of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, citing NFL.com, &quot;Lloyd suffered through the worst season for a starting receiver in the Super Bowl era... No starting No. 2 wide receivers in the NFL started more games (12) while producing less (23 catches, 365 yards).&quot;

Lloyd never made it out of Joe Gibbs&#x27; doghouse, due to a questionable attitude and alleged poor work ethic. Later, Lloyd admitted as much, that he was in fact disrespectful to the Hall of Fame head coach. On Sunday, November 4, 2007, Lloyd was listed among Redskins inactive as the team travelled to play against the New York Jets. Citing the reason behind the move, Gibbs said that Lloyd had been told to remain behind in Washington as disciplinary action for missing important team meetings. Lloyd would spend the latter part of the 2007 season on injured reserve after having snapped his collar bone while making a diving touchdown catch during team practice.

On February 26, 2008, the Redskins released Lloyd.

===Chicago Bears===
On March 7, 2008, Lloyd signed a one-year deal with the Chicago Bears after the release of Muhsin Muhammad and the loss of Bernard Berrian to free agency. The move reunited him with Bears offensive coordinator Ron Turner, who was Lloyd&#x27;s head coach at the University of Illinois. Lloyd had a successful start to his career in Chicago, establishing himself as a favourite target of quarterback Kyle Orton, with 15 catches in his first four games. An injury forced him to miss several weeks, and he fell out of favour with the coaching staff as a result. He returned to the field in week 11. He finished the season with 26 receptions for 364 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 11 games and five starts.

===Denver Broncos===

Lloyd&#x27;s contract with the Chicago Bears expired after the end of the 2008 season. In early April, Bears quarterback Kyle Orton was traded to the Denver Broncos in a deal involving Jay Cutler. As the offseason progressed, the Bears did not make any efforts to re-sign Lloyd. Lloyd signed with the Denver Broncos on June 15, 2009. Lloyd re-signed with the Broncos on March 15, 2010.

During the Broncos&#x27; 24–20 loss to the Jets on October 17, Lloyd was subjected to a helmet-to-helmet tackle/hit by New York safety Jim Leonhard, resulting in a 15-yard penalty. This hit, along with several other helmet-to-helmet hits during NFL games that weekend, led the league to announce such future &#x27;devastating hits&#x27; or &#x27;head shots&#x27; will be met with possible suspensions even for first-time offenders, a significant change in league policy, especially during an ongoing season.

He led the NFL in receiving yards with 1,448 yards for the 2010 season. He was also named 2nd Team All-Pro and invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl. He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

===St. Louis Rams===
On October 17, 2011, Lloyd was traded to the St. Louis Rams. He finished the season with a total of 70 catches, 51 with the Rams. The Rams gave up a conditional sixth-round pick that was upgraded to a fifth-round pick because Lloyd ended up having 30 receptions.

===New England Patriots===
On March 17, 2012, Lloyd signed a three-year deal with the New England Patriots. This deal reunited Lloyd with Josh McDaniels, his coach in Denver and Offensive Coordinator with the Rams. In Week 4, he scored his first touchdown as a Patriot in arguably the most famous catch of his career. In Week 8, he faced the St. Louis Rams, his former team, in London. He finished the game with two receptions, both for touchdowns, in the 45–7 victory. He finished the season with 74 catches for 911 yards and four touchdowns. He was released by the Patriots on March 16, 2013.

===San Francisco 49ers (second stint)===
After taking a year off from football, Lloyd signed a one-year deal with the 49ers on April 15, 2014. In the 2014 season, he would record 14 receptions for 294 yards and one touchdown.

===Retirement===
On October 22, 2015, Lloyd announced his retirement from professional football.

== NFL career statistics ==

== Music career ==
In addition to his football career, Lloyd has recorded music and attempted to launch a career as a rapper. In 2008 his single &quot;She All Mine&quot; made the Billboard R&amp;B chart, and his song &quot;Heavy&quot; was featured on the Spike TV show &quot;Blue Mountain State&quot;. His single &quot;Take It To The Hoop&quot; is featured on NBA Ballers 2. Lloyd has received criticism for trying to balance careers in football and rap, but he says that making music is important to expressing who he really is. Quoted in a 2011 article, Lloyd said, &quot;I have the guts to stand out and do something I&#x27;m passionate about, go against the grain and go against the conventional wisdom that the athlete-rap thing is unsuccessful. Yet I&#x27;m going to do it. People will say: &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re doing hip-hop music? Who does he think he is, a rapper? He&#x27;s trying to be someone he&#x27;s not.&#x27; When in reality, I&#x27;d be someone I&#x27;m not by not expressing myself in music.&quot;

==Acting career==
Lloyd appeared in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;After Effect&quot;, alongside Daniel Baldwin. Lloyd had one speaking line, and less than a minute of screen time. The film was available online starting October 28, 2013.

<text>In Irish mythology Neit (Néit, Nét, Neith) was a god of war. He was the husband of Nemain and/or Fea, and sometimes of Badb. Also grandfather of Balor, he was killed at the legendary Second Battle of Moytura.

== Etymology ==

The name probably derives from the proto-Celtic *&quot;nei-t-&quot; meaning fighting or passion. A similarly named deity appears on two Celtiberian inscriptions, as a Romanized &quot;Mars Neto&quot; and as &quot;Neito&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Neit is described as the uncle of the Dagda, who gave him &quot;Ailech Neit&quot; (Neit&#x27;s Stonehouse), which is elsewhere described as the grave of Ahd, son of the Dagda. &quot;Ailech Imchell,&quot; described as the &quot;bright home of horses&quot; and an envied stronghold, is another place where Aed is said to be buried and which is said to be in the &quot;precinct where dwelt Nemain and Neit.&quot; Neit is described as &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;son of Indui, king of the north country, lord of horse breeding peoples.&quot; Neit&#x27;s sons include Delbáeth, the father of Elatha, and Esarg, the father of Dian Cecht.

<doc id="1181663" wikidata="Q128391" url="?curid=1181663" title="Comic book collecting">
<text>Comic book collecting is a hobby that treats comic books and related items as collectibles or artwork to be sought after and preserved. Though considerably more recent than the collecting of postage stamps (philately) or books (bibliophilia), it has a major following around the world today and is partially responsible for the increased interest in comics after the temporary slump experienced during the 1980s.

==Overview==
Comics are collected for several possible reasons, including appreciation, nostalgia, financial profit, and completion of the collection. The comic book came to light in the pop culture arena in the 1930s due to the popularity of superhero characters Superman, Batman, and Captain Marvel. Since the 1960s, two publishers have dominated the American comic book industry: Marvel Comics, publisher of such comics as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and DC Comics, which publishes titles such as &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. Other large non-manga publishers include Image Comics, IDW, Valiant Comics, and Dark Horse Comics.

As comic books regained their popularity in the 1960s during the boom of the Silver Age, fans organized comic book conventions, where they could meet to discuss their favorite comics with each other and eventually with the creators themselves. , numerous conventions and festivals are held around the world, with Comic-Con International, held annually in San Diego, being the largest and best-known convention in the United States.

While some people collect comic books for personal interest in the medium or characters, others prefer to collect for profit. To assist both types of comic book collector, comic book price guides are available and provide estimates of comic book values as well as information on comic book creators and characters. The price guides assign values for comic books based on demand, availability, and the copy&#x27;s condition. The longest running price guide is the annual &quot;Overstreet Price Guide&quot;, first published in 1970. Another current monthly price guide is &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. The growth of the Internet in the late 1990s saw development of online databases to track creator, character appearances, and storylines, as well as websites combining comic book price guides with personalized collection tracking to provide collection values in real-time. The Grand Comics Database is a popular online resource for comic book creator and character information. Popular online price guide and collection tracking services include comicbookrealm.com, comicspriceguide.com, and GPAnalysis. The increased popularity of online auctioning services like eBay or Heritage Auctions for buying and selling comic books has greatly increased the visibility of actual comic book sale prices, leading to improved price guide accuracy, particularly for online price guides such as comicspriceguide.com and GPAnalysis. GPA only tracks sales of slabbed books, and therefore is not an accurate indicator of overall comic sales.

In response to collectors&#x27; interest in preserving their collections, products designed for the protection and storage of comic books became available, including special bags; boxes; and acid-free &quot;backing boards&quot;, designed to keep the comic book flat.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Before the late 1960s, virtually no specialized comic stores existed and the notion of comics as collectible art was in its infancy. A few collector-based retail establishments existed, most notably Pop Hollinger&#x27;s retail and mail order shop for new and used comics in Concordia, Kansas, which was in full swing by 1940. Claude Held had followed suit in Buffalo, New York, by 1946.

The origins of comic book collecting as an organized hobby has its roots in early science fiction fandom and comic book letters pages. In the early 1960s, DC Comics began publishing the full addresses of the people writing in, which allowed comic fans to reach out to each other.

Adzines like &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot; (&quot;RBCC&quot;), launched in 1964, brought fans together for the purpose of adding to their comic book collections. &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide for Comic Fandom&quot;, launched in 1971, served a similar purpose.

In the U.S. a few specialist shops had opened their doors by the 1960s — such as Gary Arlington&#x27;s San Francisco Comic Book Company in Apri 1968 — but were still a small market. The number of shops grew in the 1970s but remained relatively minimal — this is a list of notable early such retailers in the U.S. and the year they opened:
* 1972 (August) Comics and Comix, Berkeley, California
* 1974 Mile High Comics (Chuck Rozanski), Boulder, Colorado
* 1974 Pacific Comics, Pacific Beach, California
* mid-1970s Comic Kingdom (Richard Alf), San Diego, California
* mid-1970s King&#x27;s Baseball Cards and Comic Books (Dennis King), Berkeley, California
* 1976 Fat Jack&#x27;s Comicrypt, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* 1979 Golden Apple Comics, Los Angeles, California
* 1980 That&#x27;s Entertainment, Worcester, Massachusetts

Amsterdam&#x27;s Lambiek store opened in November 1968.

In the UK, the only distribution channels available were ordinary newsstands and mail order publications like &quot;Exchange and Mart&quot; or through zines run by the early panelologists themselves. Two early London-based comics speciality shops were Dark They Were and Golden Eyed (opened ( 1969) and Forbidden Planet (1978).

Two manga specialty shops opened in Tokyo, Japan, in 1979–1980: 
* Comic Takaoka, Tokyo, Japan (1979) — originally opened in 1880; shifted focus exclusively to manga in 1979
* Mandarake, Tokyo, Japan (1980)

=== Growth of the direct market ===
Denver, Colorado-based retailer Chuck Rozanski played a large role in the growth of the comics speculation market in 1977 when he acquired the high-value &quot;Mile High Collection&quot; – 16,000 comic books dating from 1937 to 1955 – and slowly began releasing select books into the marketplace.

During the late 1970s–early 1980s major comic publishers like Marvel and DC Comics started to recognize the new movements and started publishing material that was intended for sale in specialist shops only. When Marvel tested the new comics specialty market with the title &quot;Dazzler&quot; in 1981, the comic sold over 400,000 copies, a very respectable figure and one that astounded the company. Hereafter, comics publishers started tailoring ever-increasing percentages of marketing and production solely for the sale in specialist stores. While the bulk of the revenues still came from sales through regular channels, the ability to focus more specifically on specific target groups as well as distributing comics not on a sale-or-return basis, but in limited runs according to sales predictions from the retailers themselves, over-printing and overhead costs could be drastically reduced. From the 1970s to the present day, comics publishers have been targeting more and more of their titles to collector audiences with features such as limited editions, the use of high quality paper, or the inclusion of novelty items.

===The speculator boom===
From roughly 1985 through 1993, comic book speculation reached its highest peaks. This boom period began with the publication of titles like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;summer crossover epics&quot; like &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. After &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; made their mark, mainstream attention returned to the comic book industry in 1989 with the success of the movie &quot;Batman&quot; and again in 1992 with &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; storyline.

Once aware of this niche market, the mainstream press focused on its potential for making money. Features appeared in newspapers, magazines and television shows detailing how rare, high-demand comics such as &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 and &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #181 (the first appearances of Superman and Wolverine, respectively) had sold for thousands of dollars, with &quot;Action&quot; #1 breaking the $1 million mark.

During this time, mainstream comic book publishers began to pander specifically to the collectors&#x27; market. Techniques used included variant covers, polybags, and gimmick covers. When a comic was polybagged, the collector had to choose between either reading the comic book or keeping it in pristine condition for potential financial gain, or buying two or more copies to do both. Gimmicks included glow-in-the-dark, hologram-enhanced, die-cut, embossing, foil stamped or foil-embossed covers. Gimmicks were almost entirely cosmetic in nature, and almost never extended to improved content of the comics. However, many speculators would buy multiple copies of these issues, anticipating that demand would allow them to sell them for a substantial profit in the future.

Low-budget independent publishers also proliferated during this period. The low price of producing comics, and the ease and efficiency of the direct market enabled fly-by-night publishers to flood the market with product, much of it of low quality. A number of these publishers attempted to cash in on current trends – for every &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (itself a nod to the popularity of the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;), there were multitudes of blatant rip-offs like &quot;Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters&quot;, &quot;Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils&quot;, and &quot;Pre-Teen Dirty Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos&quot;.

This period also saw a corresponding expansion in price guide publications, most notably &quot;Wizard&quot; Magazine, which helped fuel the speculator boom with monthly columns such as the &quot;Wizard Top 10&quot; (highlighting the &quot;hottest&quot; back-issues of the month), &quot;Market Watch&quot; (which not only reported back-issue market trends, but also predicted future price trends), and &quot;Comic Watch&quot; (highlighting key &quot;undervalued&quot; back-issues).

The speculators who made a profit or at least broke even on their comic book &quot;investments&quot; did so only by selling to other speculators. In truth, very few of the comics produced in the early 1990s have retained their value in the current market; with hundreds of thousands (or, in several prominent cases, over ten million) copies produced of certain issues, the value of these comics has all but disappeared. &quot;Hot&quot; comics like &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 and &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 can today be found selling for under a dollar apiece.

Veteran comic book fans pointed out an important fact about the collectors market that was largely overlooked by speculators: popular Golden Age comic books were valuable because they were genuinely rare. Since comic books were originally marketed to children and not viewed as collectible until much later, most Golden Age comics didn&#x27;t survive to the present era. And before the 1990s, comic books were typically printed on cheap paper stock that aged very poorly. As a result, popular comic books published from the 1940s through the 1960s are extremely difficult to find and thus highly prized by collectors. By contrast, the speculator boom of the 1990s saw large print runs of comics on high-grade paper that were carefully stored by multitudes of collectors, creating a glut of product in the collectors market.

===Bust of the speculator market===
The comic book speculator market reached a saturation point in the early 1990s, and finally collapsed between 1993 through 1997. Two-thirds of all comic book specialty stores closed in this period, and numerous publishers were driven out of business. Even industry giant Marvel Comics was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997, although they were able to continue publishing. It is surmised that one of the main factors in Marvel&#x27;s downfall was the decision to switch to self-distribution (via their purchase of Heroes World Distribution). Until then, many publishers went through secondary distributors (such as the current and only mass distributor, Diamond Comic Distributors), and Marvel felt it could preserve some of its cash flow if it made the move to becoming one of the few publishers to also distribute directly to the comic market. This backfired terribly when the bottom fell out of the market, as they were stocked with multiple printings of variant and &quot;collectible&quot; issues that were no longer in high demand, and they could not cover the costs of their distribution service.

The bust can also be linked back to some of the series that caused the boom a few years earlier. DC&#x27;s decision to publish two blockbuster stories depicting the loss of their two major superheroes (&quot;&quot; – the breaking of the Batman – and &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;), and their subsequent flooding of the press as to their supposed finality, is considered by some collectors to have started a slow decay within the non-regular buyer comic community which then led to drops in sales. Many comic retailers believe that numerous comic speculators took the death and crippling of two major characters to signify the end of the Batman and Superman series. As many comic readers and retailers knew full well, very little in comics actually changes with any finality. Many aspects of the status quo returned after the story arcs were over (Superman died, but was resurrected, and Batman was crippled, but eventually recovered).

Many comic speculators who were only in the market to see important comics mature, then sell them for a profit, did not quite understand how quick the turnaround would be on the story recant, and many rushed out to scoop up as many copies of whatever issues were to be deemed significant. Comic shops received not only staggering sales during the week that Superman died, but also had to try to meet the demand. This led to the saturation of the market and the devaluing of what was thought to be the end of an American icon. Some comic book retailers and theorists deem DC&#x27;s practices in the press forum, and their relationship with the non-specialized consumer, to be grossly negligent of the status of the market, and that their marketing campaign, most likely not malicious in intent, spelled doom for the speculator market and comic sales in general. Others place the blame for the comic market crash on Marvel (whose product line had bloated to hundreds of separate titles by late 1993, including the poorly received &quot;Marvel UK&quot; and &quot;2099&quot; lines), or creator-owned upstart Image Comics, who fed the speculator feeding frenzy more than any other comics publisher.

Other publishing houses had different problems. Valiant Comics – at one point the third-largest comic book publisher – was sold to the video game giant Acclaim Entertainment for $65 million in June 1994. Acclaim renamed the line Acclaim Comics in 1996. Their primary motivation was to make the properties more suitable for use in video game development. Eventually, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy following the collapse of its video game business. The miniseries &quot;Deathmate&quot; – a crossover between Image Comics and Valiant Comics – is often considered to have been the final nail in the speculation market&#x27;s coffin; although heavily hyped and highly anticipated when initially solicited, the books from the Image Comics side shipped so many months late that reader interest disappeared by the time the series finally materialized, leaving some retailers holding hundreds of unsellable copies of the various &quot;Deathmate&quot; books. Other companies, such as Broadway Comics, , Continuity Comics, Defiant Comics, Eclipse Comics, First Comics, and Malibu Comics also ceased publication in the period between 1993 and 1997.

===Post-bubble speculation===
Since 1997, comic book sales have fallen to a fraction of early-1990s levels, with print runs of many popular titles down as much as 90% from their peaks. Currently, most of the hype generated around the major companies&#x27; comics involves changes to the characters, well-known creators writing or illustrating a title, and media coverage surrounding an adaptation to another medium such as film or television.

The remaining bastion of comic speculation consists of online auction sites such as eBay; but even there, comic books remain a buyer&#x27;s market. In the 2000s, prices for genuinely rare near-mint comics rose steadily, doubling in some cases. This was aided in part by newly established comic book grading companies, such as Comic Guaranty LLC (CGC) and Professional Grading eXperts LLC (PGX). Improved accountability has increased collector confidence, although some collectors have complained that the market has once again become more about speculation than being focused on the art and stories.

Until February 2002, the highest price paid for a comic book was $350,000 for &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1, bought by Jay Parrino (USA) in November 2001. The sale of a CGC-graded 8.0 &quot;very fine&quot; issue of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 reportedly sold between an undisclosed buyer and seller on the comic book online auction site &quot;Comic Connect&quot; for $1,000,000 topped the list for a few days. It was quickly eclipsed by a CGC-graded 8.0 Very Fine &quot;Detective&quot; #27 (the first Batman comic book) at Heritage Auctions, which realized $1,075,500. In July 2010, another &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, a CGC-graded 8.5, was reportedly sold by an undisclosed buyer to an undisclosed seller on &quot;Comics Connect&quot; for $1.5 million, thus setting the current record for the highest sum ever paid for a comic book.

==Conservation of comics==
To preserve comics, which are a printed medium, it is prescribed that they be stored in cool, dark places, as sunlight can bleach the inks and yellow the paper stock. Some collectors advise against storing comics in cardboard boxes, or using backing boards, as these are both sources of acid which can react with the fibers of the paper of comics, eventually destroying a comic. If these products are used to store comics, these collectors advise using products marked as acid-free.

PET film, polyethylene or polypropylene storage bags are popular, and allow a comic to be &quot;bagged&quot; in a contained environment, and have become the traditional way of storing comics. Some comic shops now sell comics already in bags, although the quality of the bag can vary. These types of bags are not considered &quot;archival safe&quot; because various plastic compositions may contain elements or have other properties that could harm the comic in years to come. Mylars are the only bags available that are archival safe. Corrugated plastic boxes, preferred by some collectors, offer greater protection against acid while also offering better protection against moisture damage and vermin damage.

Original art, typically 11x17 bristol boards with the pencils and ink, can be protected against direct sunlight as well as acid deterioration by using an archival quality frame coupled with glass which has been treated to protect against ultraviolet rays.

In the column &quot;Comic Book Vitamins&quot; on the Project Fanboy website, Steven Sykora discussed preserving collections by submitting comic books to the CGC, where comics are inspected for flaws, graded accordingly and placed in an inner well – a sealed sleeve of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. Then, the comics are sealed through a combination of compression and ultrasonic vibration in a transparent, hard plastic capsule. This process is often referred to in slang as &quot;slabbing&quot; and there is debate as to whether this provides better protection for the books than an acid-free backing board and Mylar sleeve.

Storing a comic as a computer file (scanning and saving the comic as a comic book file or .cbz/.cbr) is also an option, allowing those without access to the comic itself a chance to see at the least the story for themselves. However, as with other digital means of storing media, this also allows for the possibility of copyright infringement via unauthorized digital distribution, such as peer-to-peer file sharing networks.

=== Subscription crease ===
A subscription crease describes a specific flaw in the condition of a comic book, particularly a crease through the entire book running from top to bottom. It is a term commonly used by comic book collectors. When comic book publishers began mailing comics directly to monthly subscribers they would simply fold the comic in half and stuff it into a standard #10 business envelope. This method was expedient and cost effective – the comic book business survived on razor-thin margins – but resulted in a clearly visible line running from top to bottom of a comic. The &quot;memory&quot; factor inherent in paper assured that this crease would be visible forever. Consequently, collectors, who prize condition, consider this a defect that lowers the desirability of a particular issue. This practice faded away in the early 1970s when publishers found a marketing opportunity in mailing comics in larger envelopes, unfolded. Hence the appearance of in-issue ads touting that monthly comics were &quot;Mailed flat!&quot;

==Related collecting==
Collecting original art is the collecting of the artists&#x27; production pencils and inks used in the creation of comic books. Unlike mass-produced comic books, there is only one piece of original art for each individual comic book page or cover.

A Mike Zeck original page of the 1984 &quot;Marvel Superheroes Secret Wars&quot;, showing Spider-Man wearing his black suit for the first time, was sold by Heritage Auctions in January 2022 for over $3 million. As of 2022, it is the most expensive page of a comic book ever sold.

==List of comic collections==
Many private collections of comics exist, and they have also started to find their way onto the shelves of public libraries. Museums and universities with notable collections of comics include:
* Allen and John Saunders Collection at Bowling Green State University&#x27;s Popular Culture Library.
* British Comics Collection at The British Library.
* Comic art collection of Michigan State University.
* Comic Book Research Guide of The New York Public Library.
* The Comics Collection, including the Sol Davidson Collection at the University of Florida.
* Cartoon Research Library of Ohio State University
* CartoonHub, the website of the British Cartoon Archive, University of Kent
* James Cabell Library at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, Virginia
* The United States Library of Congress holds many collections of comic strips, comic books and periodicals.

==Comic collectors==
Comic collectors are people who collect comics or comic books. Many comic readers keep their comics for an indefinite period and have large accumulations, but a true collector differs in enthusiasm and degree; collectors will generally at least seek past issues rather than being content to read what new comics come along.

As comic book characters become more mainstream through adaptations in other media (primarily television and film), a number of notable people have professed to be comic book collectors, such as:
*Actor Nicolas Cage, who changed his original last name of Coppola (part of an extended family working in film, including his uncle Francis Ford Coppola) to the stage name &quot;Cage&quot;, based on the Marvel Comics character Luke Cage, to avoid the appearance of nepotism when he entered the film industry. A longtime comics fan, Cage amassed an impressive collection over the years, but in October 2002, he auctioned off most of his collection for combined proceeds of over $1.68 million through Heritage Auctions. Heritage sold Nicolas Cage&#x27;s remaining comics privately over the next year for approximately another $325,000, and in 2009 they also auctioned part of Cage&#x27;s movie poster collection. Cage also starred in the 2007 film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; and its 2012 sequel &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;.
*Actor Ben Affleck, who has named &quot;Daredevil&quot; as his favorite comic from his childhood. Affleck played that series&#x27; title character in the 2003 film of the same name, and played Batman in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot;.
*Writer, director and actor Kevin Smith, whose love for comics has been reflected in much of his film work in the so-called &quot;View Askewniverse&quot;, particularly the film &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Smith has also written stories for comics published by Marvel and DC; as a nod to his work on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; comic, he had a cameo in the film adaptation as a morgue worker.
*Actor Samuel L. Jackson is a reader and collector well into middle age, stating as recently as a July 2006 interview that he was reading currently-published comic books. Jackson gave Marvel Comics permission to use his likeness for the re-imagined &quot;Ultimate&quot; version of Nick Fury, and later played a similar version of Fury in several of the film and television projects comprising the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
*British TV and radio presenter Jonathan Ross is a long time collector of comic books. He donated his copy of &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 to charity, and presented a TV documentary on Steve Ditko called &quot;In Search of Steve Ditko&quot;.
*Jimmy Jacobs, the handball player who later managed Mike Tyson, owned one of the world&#x27;s largest comic book collections, including six copies of a rare 1938 issue of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;.

==Comic collecting websites==
With comics being a popular topic on the Internet, many websites dedicated to helping users manage their comic collections have been created. These websites also contain a platform for communication to assist with discussions between collectors. Some websites allow purchasing and reading comic books online.

<text>The Mitchell U-2 Superwing is an American tailless ultralight aircraft that was designed by Don Mitchell for amateur construction.

==Design and development==
Although the aircraft was designed before the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules came into force, the U-2 Superwing complies with them anyway (including the category&#x27;s maximum empty weight of ). The aircraft has a standard empty weight of . It features a cantilever mid-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The U-2 is a development of the high-wing B-10.

The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tube, while the wing is of wood and foam, with doped aircraft fabric covering. Its span wing employs a modified Wortmann FX05-191 airfoil. The flight controls are unconventional; pitch and roll are controlled by elevons and yaw is controlled by the wing tip rudders. The main landing gear has suspension and the nose wheel is steerable and equipped with a brake.

The U-2 can accept a variety of engines ranging from mounted in pusher configuration.

<text>A private candidate, also known as an external candidate, in the UK examination system is a person who enters an examination but is not enrolled as a student at the centre (school or college) where he or she sits the exam. They may have trained themselves for the exam, been taught privately, or studied at an institution which is not a registered examination centre. Centres are not compelled to accept private candidates, and many do not.

The main English examination boards - AQA, OCR, and Edexcel - all accept private candidates. CAIE also accepts private candidates. AQA does not allow private candidates to sit their examinations outside the UK.

The Welsh examination board WJEC allows private candidates. The Northern Irish CCEA uses the term &quot;external candidate&quot; to refer to people in the same situation.

<doc id="1181687" wikidata="Q3242586" url="?curid=1181687" title="International General Certificate of Secondary Education">
<text>The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) is an English language based secondary qualification similar to the GCSE and is recognised in the United Kingdom as being equivalent to the GCSE for the purposes of recognising prior attainment. It was developed by Cambridge Assessment International Education. The examination boards Edexcel, Learning Resource Network (LRN), and Oxford AQA also offer their own versions of International GCSEs. Students normally begin studying the syllabus at the beginning of Year 10 and take the test at the end of Year 11. However, in some international schools, students can begin studying the syllabus at the beginning of Year 9 and take the test at the end of Year 10.

The qualifications are based on individual subjects of study, which means that one receives an “IGCSE” qualification for each subject one takes. Typical “core” subjects for IGCSE candidates include a First Language, Second Language, Mathematics and one or more subjects in the Sciences.

==Examination boards==
Traditionally, Pearson Edexcel and especially Cambridge have a dominance in International GCSEs.

===Cambridge IGCSE===

Cambridge IGCSE exams are conducted in three sessions: February/March (India only), May/June and October/November, and the results are released in May, August and January respectively. The exams are set by Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), which is part of Cambridge Assessment that also includes OCR, a UK GCSE examination board. As of January 2021, there are over 70 subjects available and schools can offer them in any combination.

The Cambridge examination board offers an ICE (International Certificate in Education) group qualification for candidates who achieve 7 subject passes across the following groups: 
*Group 1: Languages
*Group 2: Humanities and Social Sciences
*Group 3: Sciences
*Group 4: Mathematics
*Group 5: Creative and Vocational (Professional and Creative)
The certificate is awarded to candidates who pass in seven IGCSE subjects — two Group 1 subjects, one subject from each of Groups 2–5, and a seventh subject which can be selected from any Group.

The ICE is awarded in three categories:

* Distinction (Grade A or better in five subjects and Grade C or better in two subjects)
* Merit (Grade C or better in five subjects and Grade F or better in two subjects)
* Pass (Grade G or better in seven subjects)

In addition, to award top candidates, Cambridge awards &quot;Outstanding Achievement Awards&quot; in the categories of &quot;top in country&quot; and &quot;top in world&quot; for each subject.

===Pearson Edexcel International GCSE===
Edexcel International GCSE exams used to be conducted in June and January. From the academic year starting September 2023, Edexcel International GCSE exams are conducted in June and November. The last session for January Exams is January 2023 (Academic Year September 2022 to August 2023) and the first session for November Exams is November 2023 (Academic Year September 2023 to August 2024). The exams are set by Edexcel which also sets GCSE exams in the UK.

===Oxford AQA International GCSE===
Oxford AQA International GCSE exams are conducted in May/June and November. The exams are set by Oxford AQA(Oxford International AQA Examinations), which is a joint venture between AQA which sets GCSE exams in the UK and Oxford University Press (OUP).

===LRN International GCSE===
LRN International GCSE exams are conducted in December, March and June.

==Comparisons with GCSE==
Before changes to GCSE first taken in 2017, the IGCSE was often considered to be more similar to the older O-Levels qualification than the current GCSE in England, and for this reason was often argued to be a more rigorous and more difficult examination. Before the early 2010s, most schools offering the IGCSE were private international schools for expatriate children around the world. However, in the 2010s, an increasing number of independent schools within the United Kingdom also began offering IGCSEs as an alternative to conventional English GCSEs for international IGCSE subjects, on the supposed basis that it is more challenging than the national curriculum.
A comparison between GCSEs and IGCSEs was conducted by the Department of Education in 2019. The study found that it was easier to achieve a grade A in English Language and English Literature in IGCSEs but harder to achieve a grade A in science subjects. Most other subjects were roughly equivalent.

*The change from an A*-G grading system to a 9-1 grading system by English GCSE qualifications has led to a 9-1 grade International General Certificate of Secondary Education being made available. Before, this qualification was graded on an 8-point scale from A* to G with a 9th grade “U” signifying “Ungraded”. This measure of grading was also found in the UK GCSE. Most IGCSE subjects offer a choice of tiered examinations: Core or Extended papers (in Cambridge International), and Foundation or Higher papers (in Edexcel). This is designed to make IGCSE suitable for students with varying levels of ability. In some subjects, IGCSE can be taken with or without coursework.

At one point in time, the “A*” grade in the GCSE did not exist but was later added to recognise the very top end of achievement. In the case of Further Mathematics, an extra A* grade was added for students that can “demonstrate sustained performance in higher-level maths skills such as reasoning, proof and problem-solving.”

==Recognition and equivalence==
The qualification is recognised by many institutions in the world. It also allows further vocational education and is often considered the baseline for employment.

Its academic worth is comparable to many secondary school curricula worldwide, such as England&#x27;s GCSE, the North American GED or high school diploma, Hong Kong&#x27;s HKCEE, Singapore&#x27;s O-Level, and the Indian ICSE courses. The IGCSE prepares students for further academic study, including progression to A Level and BTEC Level 3 study, LRN Pre-U, IB Diploma Programme and other equivalents. It is recognised by academic institutions and employers around the world and is considered by many institutions as equivalent to the standard GCSE.

===Hong Kong===
The IGCSE exam is widely used in international schools. Students in Hong Kong can take the Cambridge exam board as well as the Edexcel exam board, either at their school or registering through the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) as individual candidates.

=== Macao ===
The IGCSE exam is widely used in schools where the teaching medium is English and which adopt the IGCSE curriculum. Students in some international schools (Macau Anglican College, School of Nations, and Generations International School) can take the Cambridge exam board, as well as the Edexcel exam board at their schools (Pui Ching Middle School (Coloane Campus), Instituto Salesiano, Yuet Wah College, Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section), Escola Santa Rosa de Lima (English Section), and Chan Shui Ki Perpetual Help College).

===Singapore and Malaysia===
The IGCSE exam is predominantly used in international schools, while other schools offer it as an alternative to O Level exams.

===United Kingdom===

The official status of IGCSEs has changed several times in the UK.

In 2013 the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) allowed more use of IGCSE subjects in state-funded schools. Ofqual allowed the use of Cambridge IGCSE exams under the name of &quot;Cambridge International Certificates&quot;. Initially, 16 Cambridge IGCSE syllabuses received UK government accreditation. Following that, the UK government announced that the 16 accredited Cambridge IGCSE syllabuses could also be funded in state-maintained schools. Subsequently, Cambridge IGCSE German and Spanish were also accredited and funded, taking the total number of accredited and funded Cambridge IGCSEs to 18. For accreditation purposes, the syllabuses are referenced as &quot;Cambridge International Certificates&quot; in the UK, although they are known across the world as Cambridge IGCSEs. The IGCSE is offered by two examination boards in the UK, one being Edexcel, and the other one being AQA.

However, from 2017 the government decided to exclude IGCSEs from official performance tables, and consequentially entries from state schools have fallen. So that whilst &quot;international GCSEs no longer meet the condition of funding; however, they do continue to count as equivalent to GCSEs for the purposes of recognising prior attainment.&quot;

In 2018, 91% of IGCSE UK entries in core subjects were in private schools, and about 75% for all subjects.

===United States===
While the number of North American schools offering the IGCSE remains small, some homeschooling educators are said to be choosing the IGCSE instead of a typical North American high school curriculum. According to many of these educators, the IGCSE curriculum may be more advanced than a typical North American secondary school course by at least one year.

===Italy===
For some years in Italy many high schools have joined a Cambridge Schools Network, becoming Cambridge International Schools.
The aim of these schools is to get students IGCSE and As &amp; A Level certifications. 
Some Italian Universities as well accept both IGCSE and AS &amp; A Level certifications, but a minimum of grade is often required for the admission.

== Cancellations ==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, all IGCSE examinations due to take place in May/June 2020 were cancelled, along with GCSE and A-Level exams that year. As of 31 March 2020, the CAIE had decided to guide schools to predict students&#x27; grades through evidence like mock examination results.

On 30 April 2020, Pearson Edexcel announced that grades for the May/June 2020 exam would be calculated using information from schools. Schools were asked to provide an assessment grade for each student, as well as a ranked order of students within each grade by 29 May 2020.

For the June 2021 exam series, CAIE plans for exams to go ahead in countries that are permitted and safe, and countries where exams cannot take place due to government directives will switch to school-assessed grades using evidence like student coursework and mock exam results. There are also adjustments, exemptions, and special considerations available for schools that applies for them.

<doc id="1181691" wikidata="Q233282" url="?curid=1181691" title="Lyudmila Putina">
<text>Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya (formerly Putina; ; born 6 January 1958) is a Russian linguist who served as the First Lady of Russia from 2000 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2014 while married to her then-husband, Vladimir Putin, the current president and former prime minister of Russia.

== Early life and education ==
Lyudmila was born in Kaliningrad, as the daughter of Alexander (his patronym is reported variously as either Abramovich or Avramovich) Shkrebnev and Yekaterina Tikhonovna Shkrebneva. Her father worked at Kaliningrad Mechanical Plant. 

She was educated as a linguist. In 1986, Lyudmila graduated from the branch of Spanish language and philology of the Department of Philology of Leningrad State University.

== Later life and marriage ==
In her early adult years, Lyudmila was a flight attendant for the Kaliningrad branch of Aeroflot. She met Vladimir Putin at a Arkady Raikin concert in Leningrad, and they married on 28 July 1983. The couple has two daughters, Maria (born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad, Soviet Union) and Katerina (born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany).

From 1990 to 1994, Lyudmila taught German at the Department of Philology of Leningrad State University. For a few years prior to Vladimir&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister of Russia in August 1999, she was a Moscow representative of the company Telecominvest from 1998 to 1999 where she, as the only employee in the Moscow office, answered phone calls and organized meetings.

== First Lady ==
After Vladimir&#x27;s rise to political power, Lyudmila maintained a low profile on the Russian political stage, generally avoiding the limelight except as required by protocol and restricting her public role to supportive statements about her husband.

As First Lady, Lyudmila Putina was a curator of a fund that aimed to develop the Russian language and sometimes produced statements concerning Russian language and education. Her preference for &quot;maintaining and preserving&quot; the Russian language led her to make public statements against orthographic reform. The Russian Academy of Science sponsored a commission to study the orthography of the Russian language and propose changes. Their recommendations were made public in 2002 after eight years of work, but were subsequently rejected by Putina, who used Russia&#x27;s burgeoning economy as one of her reasons why the orthographic reform was not just unnecessary but untimely. However, although one newspaper in Moscow alleged that &quot;Lyudmila Putina &quot;de facto&quot; cancelled any attempts to reform spelling&quot;, the fact remains that public and academic reaction to the reforms was sufficiently negative to have that particular reform attempt abandoned.

== Divorce and remarriage ==
On 6 June 2013, she and Putin publicly announced the termination of their marriage based on a mutual decision. The divorce announcement was made on camera for the Russian news media at the State Kremlin Palace during the intermission of a performance by the Kremlin Ballet, ending years of speculation about their relationship. In April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that their divorce had been finalized.

In January 2016, a number of media outlets reported that Lyudmila married Artur Ocheretny in early 2015. In documents on the ownership of her former St. Petersburg apartment, she was referred to as Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya.

== Property and business ==
According to Reuters, Lyudmila helped create and supports the foundation called the Centre for the Development of Inter-personal Communications (CDIC) which generates millions of dollars. The CDIC&#x27;s offices are located in the center of Moscow, on Vozdvizhenka Street in the building previously known as Volkonsky House, which is its own property. The building, which once belonged to Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s grandfather, was listed in Russian cultural heritage register but was completely rebuilt in 2013, raising its height from two stories to four, despite numerous objections and protests by Moscow citizens including an unanswered appeal to Vladimir Putin signed by 200 famous science and cultural persons of the city.

The building is mainly occupied by commercial tenants, including VTB Bank, Sberbank, a construction company called Severstroygroup, a sushi restaurant, and a Burger King. Total rent from the building is about $3–4 million.

Tenants pay their rent to a company known as Meridian, which is in turn owned by a company known as Intererservis, which is wholly owned by Lyudmila. Her sister, Olga Alexandrovna Tsomayeva, was previously General Director of Intererservis. Artur Ocheretny, Lyudmila&#x27;s second husband, chairs the CDIC&#x27;s management board.

==Sanctions==
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lyudmila was sanctioned by the United Kingdom on 13 May 2022. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office stated that Lyudmila has &quot;benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities&quot;.

<doc id="1181693" wikidata="Q458835" url="?curid=1181693" title="Orgetorix">
<text>Orgetorix was a wealthy aristocrat among the Helvetii, a Celtic-speaking people residing in what is now Switzerland during the consulship of Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic.

==Planned migration==
In 61 BC, he convinced the Helvetians to attempt to migrate from Helvetian territory to southwestern Gaul (modern-day France). He was also party to a clandestine arrangement with Dumnorix of the Aedui and Casticus of the Sequani to seize control of their respective tribes by arms and between them rule most of Gaul. The conspiracy was denounced, Orgetorix was called to a hearing in chains before the government of the Helvetii. He arrived with a small army and was released but died mysteriously in a rumoured suicide. The Helvetians went on with their plans for migration but were defeated in 58 BC and returned by Julius Caesar. The incident was the beginning of the Gallic War in which Caesar subjugated Gaul.

==Etymology==
Julius Pokorny segments the name &quot;[P]orgeto-rix&quot; in which the first element contains Gallic &quot;orge&quot; &quot;kill&quot;, related to Old Irish &quot;orcaid&quot; &quot;kill&quot;, from the Indo-European root *per-g-, &quot;to hit.&quot; The second element is manifestly Celtic &quot;rīx&quot;, &quot;king:&quot; &quot;warrior-king&quot;, which does not imply that the owner of the name is necessarily a legal ruler. Although Orgetorix had aspirations in that direction, he was not a legal ruler.

==Social position==
According to Caesar&#x27;s I.2 of &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, Orgetorix was by far the wealthiest and noblest. He made himself an ambassador on behalf of the Helvetians to the other Gallic tribes, and he gave his own daughter to Dumnorix as a &quot;bona fide&quot; gesture. Orgetorix failed in his attempt to become one of three ruling triumvirs of Gaul.

==Plan for migration==
The Helvetians made elaborate plans for making such a journey. According to Caesar, they spent two years sowing crops and buying beasts of burden and intended for the migration to start in the third year. The effort came by way of marital exchange and individual alliances among some of the young nobles from all three tribes.

==Conspiracy==
Orgetorix was intending to make an unlawful attempt in seizing control of all of Gaul, with Dumnorix and Casticus as his other triumvirs. Unknown to the Helvetians, Orgetorix was making a deal to involve the use of Helvetian soldiers to seize control of all of Gaul, instead of a mere migration. If the conspiracy had been carried out, the Aeduans, Sequanians and Helvetians, under the threesome, would have all of Gaul at their disposal.

==Trial and death==
Rivals among the Helvetii discovered Orgetorix&#x27;s plot and moved to put him on trial, with the penalty of death by burning if he was found guilty. In assisting his efforts to avoid that fate, Orgetorix had meanwhile acquired a significant personal retinue, in addition to having called up an army of more than 10,000 men at arms in addition to their mobilized clients, followers and dependents.

Many Helvetians suspected that Orgetorix committed suicide, rather than face death by burning. According to Roman accounts, he managed to evade pleading his case, but as the magistrates forced away the crowd of persons from the fields, Orgetorix died. Nonetheless, the Helvetians continued their attempt to migrate.

<text>Chris Latham (born 8 September 1975) is an Australian rugby union coach and former representative player for Australia. He is currently head coach of Major League Rugby team the Chicago Hounds and was previously head coach of the Utah Warriors.

As a player, Latham enjoyed a distinguished representative career with the Queensland Reds and Australia between 1998 and 2007 before signing with Worcester Warriors in the UK and later Japanese club Kyuden Voltex.

He stands as the second highest try scorer in Wallaby history with 40 international tries, only bettered by David Campese.

== Career ==
Latham began began his career playing at the Wests Bulldogs club in Brisbane before signing a Super Rugby contract with the New South Wales Waratahs. He moved to the Queensland Reds in 1998 and cemented his place as a starting No. 15. He went on to become the first player to win the Australian Super Rugby Player of the Year award four times (2000, 2003, 2004, 2005).

Latham made his international debut against France on the 1998 Spring Tour and represented the Wallabies at three Rugby World Cups (1999, 2003 and 2007). At the 2003 tournament, he racked up an Australian record five-try haul against Namibia in Adelaide.

At the Northern Hemisphere v Southern Hemisphere Tsunami Relief match held at Twickenham in March 2005, he scored two tries and was named man of the match.

The following March, he represented the Australian Rugby Sevens team at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, but his campaign was cut short when he suffered a rib injury.

On 12 September 2006, he became the first backline player to be awarded the John Eales Medal and was later nominated by the International Rugby Board for Player of the Year, edged out for the award by New Zealand&#x27;s Richie McCaw.

Latham suffered misfortune in early 2007 when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season training with the Queensland Reds but managed to return for his third Rugby World Cup in October that year.

After a frustrating end to 2007 and start to the 2008 Super Rugby season where he battled a knee injury his representative career in Australia came to an untimely close in his return match against the Crusaders. In what should have been his penultimate appearance for the Queensland Reds, he ruptured his pectoral muscle 13 minutes into the game, drawing an end to his playing days on Australian soil as he&#x27;d already announced a move to Worcester for the following two seasons.

After leaving Worcester, he joined Kyuden Voltex, a second-division club in Japan, on a two-year contract. He was also involved in skills training and backs coaching at Kyuden, and helped them win promotion to the top division for 2012–13 before retiring in 2012.

Stephen Jones, chief rugby correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, rated Latham as the finest fullback he has ever seen.

<text>Wayne Arthurs (born 18 March 1971) is a retired Australian professional tennis player.

==Career==
His serve was his strongest weapon by far, and had been referred to as the &quot;best in the world&quot; by several of his fellow players, including Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Thomas Johansson, and Ivo Karlović. He consistently had one of the highest ace counts on the ATP Tour and favours a serve-and-volley style of play.
Arthurs has won 12 ATP doubles titles in his career. In February 2005 he achieved a belated breakthrough in singles by winning the ATP event in Scottsdale, United States, the Tennis Channel Open, in straight sets over Croat Mario Ančić. No other player in history had won his first ATP singles title at such an advanced age (Arthurs was almost 34 at the time). He also was a runner-up there for doubles with Paul Hanley, and lost to American team Bob and Mike Bryan. He is an Australian hero when it comes to Davis Cup, winning countless doubles rubbers for Australia. Throughout his singles career Arthurs experienced victory over no fewer than six players who have reached the number 1 world ranking: Pete Sampras, Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Patrick Rafter, Andy Roddick and Gustavo Kuerten. He also beat Stefan Edberg (another former number 1) in a money tournament in England on Grass – at the time, Arthurs&#x27; singles ranking was 1100 and Edberg&#x27;s was 2, making for one of the biggest differences in ranking between winner and loser on the Tour that year.

In his last ever Australian Open match the Aussie retired just three games into his third-round match against American Mardy Fish due to a rare reaction to a local anaesthetic. In practice that morning he tried out a short-term local anaesthetic that worked well against his sore hip. Just before the match began, he took another shot that was supposed to last for the duration of the match. The stronger dose deadened his leg and he could not co-ordinate his movements. He refused to blame his doctors who said that this adverse reaction happens to about 1 in 1000 patients. Arthurs became emotional during the match once he realised he couldn&#x27;t compete. After the in-between-game break, down 3–0 he waved to the crowd who thanked him for an outstanding career. It was the last Australian Open match of his career. At the time, he was the oldest participant in the Australian Open.

Arthurs played his final tournament at Wimbledon in 2007. He won qualifying matches to advance to the main draw of the major tournament. In the first round he came back from two sets down to finally win in five sets against Dutch teenager Thiemo de Bakker. In the second round Arthurs caused a major boilover by defeating the 11th-seeded Spaniard Tommy Robredo in straight sets. Arthurs was defeated in the third round by 19th seed Jonas Björkman in straight sets.

Following his retirement, Arthurs coached Queensland player Oliver Anderson.

In January 2019 Arthurs received the OLY post-nominal title at the Brisbane International tournament.

On 30 August 2000, Arthurs was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his strong commitment to tennis.

<text>FlashGet (formerly JetCar, from the literal translation of the Chinese name ) was a freeware download manager for Microsoft Windows. It was originally available in either paid or ad-supported versions, the latter of which included an Internet Explorer Browser Helper Object (BHO).

==Features==
FlashGet can be integrated with web browsers such as Avant Browser, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Netscape, Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Maxthon and SeaMonkey.
It can download a sequence of files and it can download a file from multiple locations.
It can split files to download into sections, and download each section simultaneously.
It has an integrated offline reader.
It supports HTTP, FTP, Microsoft Media Services, RTSP, BitTorrent and since version 1.8.4 eDonkey downloads.

==Malware concerns==
FlashGet has suffered from security flaws in its update mechanism which caused users to become infected with trojan viruses.

There is also some concern about FlashGet downloading every file indicated by its FGUpdate3.ini file that is downloaded from the developer every time FlashGet is started. A malicious FGUpdate3.ini modified for exploit and introduced directly through the developer&#x27;s server could cause FlashGet to download malware to the computer without alerting the user.

On April 4, 2010, FlashGet 3.4 was released containing adware and other undisclosed and unauthorized Chinese applications. Some of the ads were aggressively popping out of the system tray, causing much inconvenience. The installer was also converted to Chinese making it difficult for many users to install and remove the software.

<doc id="1181712" wikidata="Q940531" url="?curid=1181712" title="Hiroshi Abe (actor)">
<text>is a Japanese model and actor. He is known for his roles in &quot;TRICK&quot; and &quot;Godzilla 2000: Millennium&quot;.

==Biography==
Modelling period

Abe was born in Yokohama as the youngest in a family of three children. He attended Yokohama Mitsuzawa elementary school, then Yokohama City Matsumoto Junior High School, then Kanagawa Prefectural Hakusan High School. After retaking the university entrance examinations once, he attended the Department for Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Science and Technology of Chuo University in Tokyo and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. In 1985 while in college he applied to the &quot;Shueisha 3rd Nonno Boyfriend Award&quot; and won the championship because his sister recommended the award. Since then, during his university days, he was a charismatic model for magazines such as Men&#x27;s Non-no and &quot;Nonno&quot;. He later transitioned from modelling into acting.

Unfavourable times

He made his debut as an actor in the movie &quot;Haikara-San: Here Comes Miss Modern&quot; (1987) - in which he co-starred with Yoko Minamino, a popular idol of the time whom Abe himself was a fan of, and received an autograph. He also released an album in 1988 as a pop idol.
After that year he mainly worked as an actor, but because of his title and appearance as a model he was given only secondary and mundane roles (he said he was &quot;riding with a Ferrari&quot;). Furthermore, there was the problem that it was difficult to take a double shot with a woman because of his height. Gradually, the work in drama decreased, and he suffered from a big feeling of impatience. 
He was not blessed with work for three years and made a living from pachinko. Around this time he started ancient martial arts which led to later work. Also he invested in an apartment. Due to the decline in real estate values as a result of the bursting of the bubble economy, and the decline in his popularity, he was left with a large debt. He was the target of the variety show &quot;What is that person now?&quot; which searched for &quot;the celebrity that once dominated the world&quot;. According to his book, when he heard that Ken Takakura starred in the NHK drama &quot;Chihoru&#x27;s Elegy&quot; in 1992, he wanted to appear even in an unnamed bit part, and he tried to get it even though it was a small part.

Turning Point

In 1993 he starred as a bisexual detective director in &quot;Atami Murder Case Monte Carlo Illusion&quot; written and directed by Kohei Tsuka. 
In 1994 he co-starred in &quot;Shinoidare&quot; (directed by Tatsuoki Hosono) with Koji Yakusho and received the Special Award at the Japanese Professional Movie Awards in combination with film &quot;Kyouju Luger P08&quot;.
Starting with playing the role of the talented Rōjū Matsudaira Norisato in the 1995 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Hachidai Shogun Yoshimune&quot;, the number of appearances in historical dramas increased over time, especially in the Taiga dramas &quot;Genroku Ryoran&quot;(1999), &quot;Musashi MUSASH&quot; (2003), &quot;Yoshitsune&quot; (2005) and &quot;Tenchijin&quot; (2009).

Another breakthrough

In 2000, he secured a leading role in the drama &quot;TRICK&quot;, in which he co-starred with Yukie Nakama, he played the role thoroughly and used many photographs of his modelling era as self-deprecation material. In addition, he starred in the movie &quot;The Summer of the Ubume&quot; which was based on the novel of the same name written by Natsuhiko Kyogoku, and as a result, he help working on postwork of Natsuhiko Kyogoku&#x27;s book &quot;Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro - Ame&quot; which is also inspired by the movie. He wrote his impressions of appearing in this movie.

His performance in the TV drama &quot;The Man Who Can&#x27;t Get Married&quot; won the FNS Good Work Grand Prize in 2006.

Popular at the time of the economy bubble, he appeared in the movie &quot;Bubble Fiction: Boom or Bust&quot; released in 2007.

He took the voicing role of Kenshiro for the animated movie &quot;Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior&quot; released on 11 March 2006.

In 2009, Abe won the Best Actor award in the 63rd Mainichi Film Award for his performances in &quot;Still Walking&quot; and &quot;Aoi Tori&quot;. Abe also starred in Hideki Takeuchi&#x27;s &quot;Thermae Romae&quot;. He then played a supporting role in Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s &quot;I Wish&quot;.

<doc id="1181718" wikidata="Q1199974" url="?curid=1181718" title="MV Derbyshire">
<text>MV &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was a British ore-bulk-oil combination carrier built in 1976 by Swan Hunter, as the last in the series of the sextet. She was registered at Liverpool and owned by Bibby Line.

&quot;Derbyshire&quot; was lost on 9 September 1980 during Typhoon Orchid, south of Japan. All 42 crew members and 2 of their wives were killed in the sinking. At 91,655 gross register tons, she is the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea.

==History==
MV &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was launched in late 1975 and entered service in June 1976, as the last ship of the &quot;Bridge&quot;-class combination carrier, originally named &quot;Liverpool Bridge&quot;. She and &quot;English Bridge&quot; (later &quot;Worcestershire&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Bridge&quot;) were built by the Seabridge Shipping Ltd. consortium for Bibby Line. The ship was laid up for two of its four years of service life.

In 1978, &quot;Liverpool Bridge&quot; was renamed &quot;Derbyshire&quot;, the fourth ship to carry the name in the company&#x27;s fleet. On 11 July 1980, on what turned out to be the ship&#x27;s final voyage, &quot;Derbyshire&quot; left Sept-Îles, Quebec, Canada, her destination being Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, though she foundered near Okinawa, in southern Japan. &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was carrying a cargo of 157,446 tonnes of iron ore.

On 9 September 1980, &quot;Derbyshire&quot; hove-to in Typhoon Orchid, some from Okinawa, and was overwhelmed by the tropical storm, killing all aboard. She never issued a mayday distress message. The ship had been following weather routing advice by Ocean Routes, a commercial weather routing company.

The search for &quot;Derbyshire&quot; began on 15 September 1980 and was called off six days later. When no trace of the vessel was found, it was declared lost. Six weeks after &quot;Derbyshire&quot; sank, one of the vessel&#x27;s lifeboats was sighted by a Japanese tanker.

&quot;Derbyshire&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Kowloon Bridge&quot; was lost off the coast of Ireland in 1986, following the observation of deck cracking, first discovered after an Atlantic crossing. In the wake of this second disaster, Nautilus International, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation funded a new investigation, sought by relatives of the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; victims.

== Further investigation ==
In 1994, a deep-water search began. In June 1994, the wreck of &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was found at a depth of , spread over . A subsequent expedition spent over 40 days photographing and examining the debris field, looking for evidence of what sank the ship. Ultimately, it was determined that waves crashing over the bow of the ship had earlier sheared off the covers of small ventilation pipes near the bow. Over the next two days, seawater had entered through the exposed pipes into the forward section of the ship, causing the bow to slowly ride lower and lower in the water. Eventually, the bow was made vulnerable to the full force of the rough waves, which caused the massive hatch on the first cargo hold to buckle inward, allowing hundreds of tons of water to enter within seconds. As the ship started to sink, the second, then third hatches also failed, dragging the ship underwater. As the ship sank, the increasing water pressure caused the ship to be twisted and torn apart by implosion/explosion, a property of double-hulled ships in which the compression of the air between the hulls causes a secondary explosive decompression.

The formal forensic investigation concluded that the ship sank because of structural failure and absolved the crew of any responsibility. Most notably, the report determined the detailed sequence of events that led to the structural failure of the vessel. A third comprehensive analysis was subsequently done by Douglas Faulkner, professor of marine architecture and ocean engineering at the University of Glasgow. His 2001 report linked the loss of the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; with the emerging science on freak waves, concluding that the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was almost certainly destroyed by a rogue wave.

Work by sailor and author Craig B. Smith in 2007 confirmed prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 and determined that the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a &quot;static head&quot; of water of about with a resultant static pressure of . This is in effect of seawater (possibly a &quot;super rogue wave&quot;) flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; were determined to be the key point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than of water or , meaning that the typhoon load on the hatches was more than ten times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; is now widely regarded as irrefutable.

Fast-moving waves are now known to &quot;also&quot; exert extremely high dynamic pressure. It is known that plunging or breaking waves can cause short-lived impulse pressure spikes called &quot;Gifle peaks&quot;. These can reach pressures of (or more) for milliseconds, which is sufficient pressure to lead to brittle fracture of mild steel. Evidence of failure by this mechanism was also found on the &quot;Derbyshire&quot;. Smith has documented scenarios where hydrodynamic pressure of up to or over 500 metric tonnes per square metre could occur.

==Memorials==

A bronze plaque was placed on the wreckage as a memorial to those who were lost.

On 21 September 1980, the Bibby Line vessel &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; held a memorial service for &quot;Derbyshire&quot; in the area the vessel was lost.

The 20th anniversary of the vessel&#x27;s loss was marked by a memorial service in Liverpool, England, which was attended by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, himself a former merchant seaman. Ten years later a memorial service was held in the vessel&#x27;s home port of Liverpool on the 30th anniversary of &quot;Derbyshire&quot;″s loss.

A permanent monument was dedicated on 15 September 2018 in the garden of the Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool.

<text>The Monongahela Railway was a coal-hauling Class II railroad in Pennsylvania and West Virginia in the United States. It was jointly controlled originally by the Pennsylvania Railroad, New York Central subsidiary Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, with NYC and PRR later succeeded by Penn Central Transportation. The company operated its own line until it was merged into Conrail on May 1, 1993.

The primary connection to both controlling systems was at Brownsville, Pennsylvania - with the south end of the P&amp;LE&#x27;s Pittsburgh, McKeesport and Youghiogheny Railroad and with the PRR&#x27;s ex-Brownsville Railway. The PRR also interchanged traffic at Hoover, Pennsylvania, the end of its Coal Lick Run Branch. The B&amp;O Railroad interchanged at Leckrone, Pennsylvania, and Rivesville, West Virginia.

At the end of 1970 it operated 193 miles of road on 281 miles of track; that year it reported 446 million ton-miles of revenue freight.

== History ==
The Monongahela Railroad&#x27;s headquarters and base of operations was Brownsville, Pennsylvania. &quot;As early as 1883, the Pittsburgh, Virginia &amp; Charleston Railway served Brownsville as evidenced by an old lithograph of the Three Towns showing a diamond stacked locomotive coupled to four passenger cars, ready for a northward move, sitting on the track close to the Snowden House and the United States Post Office. However, the June, 1893, Official Guide (page 324), does not indicate any passenger service to Brownsville off the Redstone Branch.&quot; 

The Monongahela Railroad was a joint venture of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&amp;LE), both of which had plans to extend their lines in the area. Each company appointed four of their members to the board of directors, who held their first meeting in January 1901. The newly formed Monongahela Railroad acquired many lines in the area from the PV&amp;C as well as the Southwest Pennsylvania Railway Company, as well as the 19 mile (30 km) right of way from Brownsville to Adah from the PRR, for the sum of $519,696.13.

In 1905 the Dunlap Creek branch opened, serving several mines and coke works and also connecting with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The last move on this line was on November 6, 1975; the track was removed and the real estate disposed.

In 1909 the Rush Run branch was constructed, and a patch town (Sarah, Pennsylvania) was constructed to house the workers at what was to have been a coal mine. It was later determined that the coal did not belong to the mine developer, and the line was abandoned, the town was scrapped. Only four trains ever ran on this line, those carrying the ballast to complete the track.

In 1910 the federal government condemned the low-clearance covered bridge in Bridgeport (now South Brownsville), and the Monongahela Railroad bought the bridge company and removed the bridge. In the same year they installed a 10-stall roundhouse in Bridgeport. This was to be the main yard for the railroad throughout its history.
In 1911 the railroad served seven mines and fifty one coke works (with 34 coke works and 1 mine being on the Dunlap Creek Division) The daily rated output was 1,395 cars of coke and 280 cars of coal. In 1911-1912 the big push was the state line extension, to make a connection with the Buckhannon and Northern Railway (B&amp;N). It involved a major river crossing and two large creek crossings.

On July 1, 1915 the Monongahela Railroad consolidated with the Buckhannon and Northern Railway to form the Monongahela Railway Company (MRY), still under the control of the parent companies (PRR and P&amp;LE).

In 1927 the Baltimore and Ohio railroad acquired 1/3 (1/6 from each the PRR and P&amp;LE) of the capital stock of the Monongahela Railway, securing their interests in the coal-producing area it served.

On January 1, 1930 the Ten Mile Run branch opened. This branch still serves one major coal mine, the Emerald Mine in Waynesburg, as of 2015.

On October 21, 1950 the Monongahela Railway discontinued passenger service.

On November 25, 1952 the Monongahela Railway ran its first Baldwin S-12 diesel locomotive. This marked the beginning of the end of their fleet of steam locomotives, the last one of which being used on May 26, 1954.

In June 1968 the Waynesburg Southern Railroad Company (organized in the interest of the PRR) opened a line from Waynesburg to Consolidated Coal Company&#x27;s Blacksville No. 1 mine and Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel Company&#x27;s Federal No. 2 mine. This line is still in service as of 2015, although Blacksville No. 1 has closed while a third mine in the same area, Blacksville No. 2, is active.

On May 1, 1993 the Monongahela Railway was merged into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), which had previously bought out the shares of B&amp;O successor CSX Transportation and Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie. Conrail would be bought in 1998 by Norfolk Southern and CSX. Eleven GE Class B23-7Rs (sometimes referred to as Super 7s), the Monongahela&#x27;s final locomotive fleet numbered 2300–2310, were renumbered 2030-2040 by Conrail, then divided between NS and CSX when they operationally took over Conrail operations in 1999.

== Heritage unit ==
In 2012, Norfolk Southern celebrated 30 years of being formed, and painted 20 locomotives in predecessor schemes to honor its heritage. Nineteen of them were new deliveries, but when NS decided to included the Monongahela in the program, it selected GE ES44AC #8025 (already in service in standard NS paint) to be painted into the Monongahela scheme.

<doc id="1181722" wikidata="Q335703" url="?curid=1181722" title="Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton">
<text>Frederick James Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton, (23 August 1883 – 14 December 1964), was an English businessman and politician who served as chairman of the Conservative Party from 1946 to 1955.

In April 1940, he was appointed Minister of Food and established the rationing system. During this time, he maintained food imports from America and organised a programme of free school meals. The vegetarian Woolton pie was named after Woolton, as one of the recipes commended to the British public due to a shortage of meat, fish, and dairy products during the Second World War. In 1943, Woolton was appointed Minister of Reconstruction, planning for post-war Britain.

==Early career==
Lord Woolton was born at 163 West Park Street in Ordsall, Salford, Lancashire, in 1883. He was the only surviving child of a saddler, Thomas Robert Marquis (1857–1944), and his wife, Margaret Marquis, &quot;née&quot; Ormerod (1854–1923). Educated at Ardwick Higher Elementary School, then at Manchester Grammar School and the University of Manchester, Woolton was an active member of the Unitarian Church. He was active in social work in Liverpool (1906–1918).

Woolton hoped to pursue an academic career in the social sciences, but his wish was frustrated by his family&#x27;s financial circumstances, and he became a mathematics teacher at Burnley Grammar School. He was forced to turn down a research fellowship in Sociology at the University of London but was elected a research fellow in Economics at the University of Manchester in 1910, where he took the degree of MA in 1912.

Having been judged unfit for military service, Woolton became a civil servant, first in the War Office, then at the Leather Control Board, where he served as a civilian boot controller. At the end of the war, he became secretary of the Boot Manufacturers&#x27; Federation, joining Lewis&#x27;s department store in Liverpool, where he was an executive (1928–1951), becoming director in 1928 and chairman in 1936. In 1938, he responded to the Anschluss by announcing that his stores would boycott Nazi German goods. Despite public support, he was reprimanded by Horace Wilson on behalf of Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s National Government for diverging from its European policy of appeasement. 

Woolton was knighted in 1935 and was raised to the peerage in 1939 for his contribution to British industry. Despite his wishes, Garter King of Arms informed him that it was not possible to take the title of &quot;Baron Marquis&quot; (because &quot;Marquess&quot;, or &quot;Marquis&quot;, constitutes a rank of British peerages), so he was created Baron Woolton after the Liverpool suburb of Woolton in which he had lived. He subsequently served on several government committees (including the Cadman Committee). He refused to affiliate himself with any political party.

==Second World War==

In April 1940, Woolton was appointed as Minister of Food by Neville Chamberlain, one of several ministerial appointments from outside politics. Woolton retained this position until 1943. He supervised 50,000 employees and over a thousand local offices where people could obtain ration cards. His ministry had a virtual monopoly of all food sold in Britain, whether imported or local. His mission was to guarantee adequate nutrition for everyone. With food supplies cut sharply because of enemy action and the needs of the services, rationing was essential. Woolton and his advisors had one scheme in mind, but economists convinced them to instead try point rationing. Everyone would have a certain number of points a month that they could allocate any way they wanted. The experimental approach to food rationing has been considered successful; indeed, food rationing was a major success story in Britain&#x27;s war.

In late June 1940, with a German invasion threatened, Woolton reassured the public that emergency food stocks were in place that would last &quot;for weeks and weeks&quot; even if the shipping could not get through. He said &quot;iron rations&quot; were stored for use only in great emergency. Other rations were stored in the outskirts of cities liable to German bombing. When the Blitz began in late summer 1940, he was ready with more than 200 feeding stations in London and other cities under attack.

Woolton had the task of overseeing rationing due to wartime shortages. He took the view that it was insufficient to merely impose restrictions but that a programme of advertising to support it was also required. He warned that meat and cheese, as well as bacon and eggs, were in very short supply and would remain that way. Calling for a simpler diet, he noted that there was plenty of bread, potatoes, vegetable oils, fats, and milk.

By January 1941, the usual overseas food supply had fallen in half. By 1942, however, ample food supplies were arriving through Lend Lease from the U.S. and a similar Canadian programme. Worried about children, he made sure that by 1942 Britain was providing 650,000 children with free school meals; about 3,500,000 children received milk at school, in addition to priority supplies at home. However, his national loaf of wholemeal brown bread replaced the ordinary white variety, to the distaste of most housewives. Children learned that sweets supplies were reduced to save shipping space.

Woolton kept food prices down by subsidizing eggs and other items. He promoted recipes that worked well with the rationing system, including the &quot;Woolton pie,&quot; which consisted of carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and turnips in oatmeal, with a pastry or potato crust, and served with brown gravy. Woolton&#x27;s business skills made the Ministry of Food&#x27;s job a success, and he earned a strong personal popularity despite the shortages.

Sworn of the Privy Council in 1940, Lord Woolton was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1942. In 1943, Woolton joined the War Cabinet as Minister of Reconstruction, taking charge of the difficult task of planning for post-war Britain and in this role, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on the issue of 26 March 1945. In May 1945, he was a member of Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Caretaker&quot; Government as Lord President of the Council.

==Conservative Party Chairman==
In July 1945, Churchill lost the 1945 general election, and his government fell. The next day, Woolton joined the Conservative Party and was soon appointed party chairman, with the job of improving the party&#x27;s organisation in the country and revitalising it for future elections. Under Woolton, many sweeping reforms were carried out, and when the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, Woolton served in the Cabinet for the next four years.

Woolton rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton also proposed changing the name of the party to the Union Party and later emphasised a rhetoric that characterised opponents as &quot;Socialist&quot; rather than &quot;Labour&quot;. He was given credit for the Conservative victory in 1951, their first since 1935.

In May 1950, Woolton, with Churchill&#x27;s approval, called for a form of coalition with the Liberal Party based on nine principles he said they agreed upon:
# Opposition to &quot;the over-encroaching power of the State over the lives of individuals and of the processes which this commercial nation lives&quot;
# Opposition to the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, &quot;which is the creed of socialism&quot;;
# Opposition to &quot;the centralisation of government in Whitehall and the weakening of the influence of local authorities&quot;;
# Belief in &quot;the establishment, under private enterprise, of partnership in industry, whereby all ranks engaged in it shall … share in the increased yield that comes from greater effort or increased skill&quot;;
# Belief in the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment,
# Belief that &quot;the best purposes of the State are served when there is economy in public administration and when Government conducted with rigorous avoidance of waste&quot;;
# Belief in high standards of health, housing, and education, coupled with religious freedom;
# Recognition of the national duty of maintaining sufficient defense forces, of the danger of militant Communism, and of the necessity for close economic and political cooperation with America and Western Europe;
# &quot;Tolerance, comradeship and unity among all classes.&quot;

The Liberal leadership rejected the coalition proposal as one that the Conservatives would control. Labour had recently narrowly won the 1950 general election. The Conservatives without Liberal help won the 1951 general election.

In the 1953 Coronation Honours, he elevated as Viscount Woolton. And in 1956, he was advanced as Earl of Woolton taking the subsidiary title Viscount Walberton.

==Civic service==
In November 1945, Woolton gave his inaugural address as President of the Royal Statistical Society.

From 1943 until 1963 he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Red Cross Society and was appointed a Knight of the Order of St John in 1947.

A Freeman of the City of London, Lord Woolton served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters for 1951/52.

==Death==
Woolton died 14 December 1964 at his home, Walberton House, in Arundel, Sussex, when his titles devolved upon his son, Roger. 

Lord Woolton is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Walberton, Sussex.

<text>Epping is a London Underground station in the suburban town of Epping in Essex, England. The station serves as the north-eastern terminus of the Central line and the next station towards London is Theydon Bois. Located in Travelcard Zone 6, it is one of eight London Underground stations in the Epping Forest District. 

==History==
In 1856, the Eastern Counties Railway opened a double-track railway between Stratford and Loughton. In 1865, its successor, the Great Eastern Railway, added a single-track extension from Loughton to Ongar. The popularity of the line led to the doubling of the track between Loughton and Epping in 1892. The line was well served, with 50 trains operating between Liverpool Street and Loughton each day, a further 22 continuing to Epping and 14 more to Ongar.

Loughton to Epping became part of the London Underground Central line on 25 September 1949, leaving the single track line from Epping to Ongar as the last steam-worked section. British Railways continued running Ongar services until 1957 when the line was electrified and became part of the Central line. However, services did not run through to the rest of the Central line except for occasional depot workings, so passengers to/from stations beyond Epping normally had to change platforms for the single-track line to Ongar, North Weald or Blake Hall stations. On 2 November 1981, Blake Hall closed and trains passed through the station. On 30 September 1994 London Underground withdrew the service between Epping and Ongar and subsequently sold off that section of the Central line.

On 11 May 2008 an e-petition calling for the reopening of North Weald and Ongar stations was created on the Downing Street website. It closed on 11 December 2008 with 1012 signatures. Part of the Epping-Ongar line is now a heritage railway, the Epping Ongar Railway. Subject to finance and planning, the heritage railway propose to build a new station close to the tube station called Epping Forest as the heritage line cannot run in to the original station.

Epping Station was to be the terminus of the proposed London Underground Chelsea-Hackney line (Crossrail 2). However, since 2013, the route options for this proposed line have been amended to terminate at New Southgate instead and no longer include the Epping branch.

Epping station saw a growth in passenger numbers in the mid 1990s due to the closures of nearby North Weald, Blake Hall and Ongar stations. This growth has continued due to significant development in Epping itself and surrounding villages. Another major contributing factor is that many people living in not too distant towns such as Harlow, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, and Chelmsford use the station instead of their own National Rail stations, because it is considerably cheaper to travel to London by London Underground than it is to use National Rail services. Growth is now at such a point where the station&#x27;s car park is full by 6:30 am on weekdays, and parking around the station (as with other stations on this part of the line, e.g. Theydon Bois and Debden) has become a serious problem for local residents, which in turn has caused many residents and local groups to call for the re-opening of North Weald and Ongar stations to help ease demand on Epping station.

==Trivia==
* The longest possible journey on the London Underground without changing trains is the Central line route between West Ruislip and Epping (34.1 miles / 54.9 km).
* In , Epping station had an annual usage of million and was the station on the London Underground.
* Epping has the largest public London Underground station car park with 519 spaces.
* It is the only London Underground station located outside the M25 motorway that is not served by the Metropolitan line.
* According to Attitude magazine, it has the highest daily number of homosexual passengers of any Travelcard Zone 6 station.

<text>The Garden of Allah was a mid-20th century gay cabaret that opened in 1946 in the basement of the Victorian-era Arlington Hotel in Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square. It was Seattle&#x27;s most popular gay cabaret in the late 1940s and 1950s and one of the first gay-owned gay bars in the United States. Prior to becoming a cabaret, the space had been a speakeasy, during Prohibition, and then a tavern.

The Garden catered to all factions of the LGBT community, though heterosexual patrons, tourists and military personnel on leave also visited. Acts were primarily female impersonation, though some male impersonators also performed; the former sometimes included striptease. One act was the professional female-impersonation Jewel Box Revue, though that act was largely geared to and supported by hetero people.

Patrons report that the cabaret became like a &quot;family&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;, and Don Paulson, author of &quot;An Evening at the Garden of Allah: A Gay Cabaret in Seattle&quot;, noted that he believes the sense of community and group consciousness produced by the Garden was what made the gay rights movement of later decades possible.

The Garden closed in 1956, when a combination of a rate raise from the musicians&#x27; union and a raise in city taxes on locales that provided both entertainment and alcohol put it out of business.

<text>The Kabardians (Kabardian: Къэбэрдей адыгэхэр; Adyghe: Къэбэртай адыгэхэр; ) or Kabardinians are one of the twelve major Circassian tribes, representing one of the twelve stars on the green-and-gold Circassian flag. They are also commonly known by the plural terms Kabardin, Kebertei, or Kabarday. Along with the Besleney tribe, they speak a distinctive dialect of Circassian. Historically the Kabardians lived in Kabardia, a region of the north Caucasus. In modern times the Kabardians live mostly in the Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which partly corresponds to the historic region.

Despite the Soviet administrative divisions that placed Circassians under four different designations and political units, namely &quot;Adygeans&quot; (Circassians in Adygea), &quot;Cherkessians&quot; (Circassians in Karachay-Cherkessia), &quot;Kabardians&quot; (Circassians in Kabardino-Balkaria), and &quot;Shapsugs&quot; (Circassians in Krasnodar Krai), all four groups are essentially the same people (Circassians). Furthermore, Cherkessians are mostly of the Kabardian and Besleney tribes.

== Population ==

Kabardians are the largest Circassian group in the world in general and form the largest group in Russia, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries. Kabardians numbered around 520,000 in Kabardino-Balkaria, Russia, and about 50,000 in Karachay-Cherkessia in Russia. In Turkey, where more than 1 million live, they are concentrated on the Uzunyayla plateau of Kayseri Province and around central Turkey. However, there are Kabardian villages in Balıkesir, Düzce, Eskişehir in northwest Turkey, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in the Black Sea region, amongst many others. Significant populations of Kabardians also live in Jordan, and there are communities in the United States. In Israel and Jordan, respectively, Shapsugs and Abzakhs are the largest groups.

== Religion ==
Religions historically practiced by Kabardians include the native Adyghe Xabze faith, Christianity and Islam. The majority of Kabardians had converted to Islam by the early 19th century. There are also still some adherents to traditional Xabze beliefs, with 1.8% being practiced in Kabardino-Balkaria, although most Kabardians are either Non-denominational or Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school

Kabardians also constituted one of the earliest Christian communities in Europe, converting in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. Kabardians living in Mozdoksky District in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania are Orthodox Christians. Some of the Kabardians living in the southern part of the neighbouring Kursky district of Stavropol Krai are also Orthodox Christians.
There are also some Roman Catholic Kabardians (possibly descended from families who reportedly converted from Orthodoxy during the 13th century). According to the 2012 survey census, of the 240,000 Catholics who lived in Russia, 1.8% were Kabardians.
