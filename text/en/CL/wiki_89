<text>Natural history in the Indian subcontinent has a long heritage with a recorded history going back to the Vedic era. Natural history research in early times included the broad fields of palaeontology, zoology and botany. These studies would today be considered under field of ecology but in former times, such research was undertaken mainly by amateurs, often physicians, civil servants and army officers.

Although the growth of modern natural history in India can be attributed to British colonialism and the growth of natural history in Britain, there is considerable evidence to suggest that India with its diverse landscapes, fauna and flora along with other tropical colonies helped in creating an increased interest in natural history in Britain and elsewhere in the world. Natural history in India was also enriched by older traditions of conservation, folklore, nature study and the arts.

==Indus Valley Civilization==

Over a thousand sites of the Indus Valley civilisation across north west South Asia, before 1700 BC have been studied to date. A large number of animal bones have been found at these sites; one-fifth of these comprising bones of wild fauna, such as the jackal, hare, chital, rhinoceros and elephant. Most seeds found in the dwellings of some western Indian sites are of wild plants now extinct in the region.

The fauna and flora of those times are richly represented in the clay pottery and tablets excavated from these sites. Clay tablets document many species of now locally extinct wildlife including rhinoceros and elephant. A tiger seal has been found in Harrappa dating back to 3000 BC.

The swamp deer or &quot;barasingha&quot; was found in Mehrgarh in Baluchistan till 300 BC and probably became locally extinct due to over-hunting and loss of riverine habitat to cultivation. A species of wild cattle, &quot;Bos primegenius nomadicus&quot; or the zebu vanished early on from its range in the Indus basin and western India, possibly due to inter-breeding with domestic cattle and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.

The first recorded domestication of the elephant was in Harappan times and the animal ultimately went on to serve as a siege engine, mount in war, status symbol, work animal, and an elevated platform for hunting.

==Vedic period==
The Vedas represent some of the oldest historical records available (1500 – 500 BC) and they list the names of nearly 250 kinds of birds besides many other notes on various other fauna and flora. In the vedic texts, &quot;Aryavarta&quot;, the land of the Aryans, was considered to be co-terminous with the range of the blackbuck. Sometimes, these referred to the lands North of the Vindhyas; at others times, it included lands to the South. A notable piece of information mentioned in the Vedas is the knowledge of brood parasitism in the Indian koel, a habit known well ahead of Aristotle (384 – 322 BC). This is possibly because both the Indian koel and its host the house crow were common and easy to observe.

The medical treatises of Charaka and Sushruta mention wildlife from the point of view of the meats the forests yielded and their associated attributes. The stratification of Hindu society into the caste system saw the warrior caste or &quot;kshatriya&quot; setting itself apart on hereditary lines; one assertion of which was the right to eat certain animals. The treatises espoused rules as to when, and who could or could not eat flesh of particular animals; for example, the flesh of the lion and tiger were to be consumed solely by regents and that too on rare occasions.

The elephant was another well studied wild animal and the capture, training and maintenance of elephants was documented in the 2000-year-old text &quot;Gajashastra&quot; written in the Pāli script.

The Tamil literature of the &quot;Sangam&quot; period, depicts a classification of land into 5 eco-types; ranging from the littoral to wet paddy fields. These landscapes were named after specific species of plants, named after their flowers (Strobilanthes spp., Jasminus spp., Lagerstroemia reginae, Wrightia tinctoria and Nymphaea. The Tamils also designated specific faunal assemblages for each of these 5 landscapes. Unlike most of the natural history information in Indian poetry, the Sangam poems contain realistic descriptions of morphology, behaviour and ecology of various species, besides astonishing comparison of flora (or floral parts) with fauna (or their parts).

==The Maurya period==
The protection of animals became serious business by the time of the Maurya dynasty in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. The first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas towards forests, its denizens and fauna in general is of interest.

The Mauryas firstly looked at forests as a resource. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of Seleucus, Alexander&#x27;s governor of the Punjab. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was more cost and time-effective to catch, tame and train wild elephants than raise them. Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the &quot;Protector of the Elephant Forests&quot;:

The Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers, for skins. Elsewhere the &quot;Protector of Animals&quot; also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.

The Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or &quot;aranyaca&quot; to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.

The Mauryan emperor Ashoka (304 – 232 BC), embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign and brought about significant changes in his style of governance. He provided protection to fauna and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was perhaps the first ruler to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king&#x27;s example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:
However, the edicts of Ashoka and the contents of Arthashastra reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 &#x27;panas&#x27; fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the freedoms exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.

==Chalukya period==
Arguably, the best treatise on hunting in Sanskrit was the &quot;Manasollasa&quot; composed in the times of the Chalukyas, the 12th century rulers of the Deccan. Another work from this period was &quot;Mriga Pakshi Shastra&quot;, a treatise on mammals and birds written in the 13th century by a Jain poet, Hamsadeva. The accuracy of the content has however been critiqued by many including Salim Ali. 

==Mughal period==
The Moghul emperors not only led a leisurely life but also pursued gardening and art. They decorated their gardens with their private zoos and hired artists to paint many subjects including plants and animals. Hunting and falconry were also extensively practised. They also employed scribes and were among the first to document their observations of nature in India. The foremost of the observers were Jehangir (1569–1627) and Babur (1483–1530) (See also Baburnama).

===Babur===

The notes of Babur for instance indicate the former distribution of the rhinoceros as far west as the Indus:

Salim Ali provides more details of this incident:
===Jahangir===
Jahangir also kept detailed records of his hunts. From the ages of 12 (1580) to 48, 28,532 animals had been hunted with 17,167 by himself. These included 86 tigers (and lions), 9 bears, leopards, foxes, otters (&quot;ubdilao&quot;) and hyaenas, 889 – blue bulls (nilgai) and 35 &quot;mhaka&quot;. Salim Ali suggests that the mhaka must refer to swamp deer.

Salim Ali in his 1927 article &quot;The Moghul emperors of India and naturalists and sportsmen&quot; notes:
Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist of Jehangir, was the first man to accurately paint the Siberian crane. The dodo was brought to Jehangir&#x27;s court via Portuguese controlled Goa and an unsigned painting of it in the Hermitage Museum is attributed to Mansur.

==Pre-colonial period==

&quot;Hortus indicus malabaricus&quot; was the oldest regional flora for any part of the world and was published in India in the 18th century by the Dutch East India Company through the work of Hendrik van Rheede (1636–1691).

==Colonial period==
With cabinets of curiosity already popular in European homes, trade and movement of natural history specimens around the world grew with the growth of shipping. The East India Company was quick to note the interest in natural curiosities and set up the first museum in London. The collections grew rapidly. With the establishment of colonies in India, there were also attempts to set up menageries in India. An early attempt was the Barrackpore menagerie established by Richard Wellesley in 1801 through the Institution for Promoting the Natural History of India. 
The Indian Civil Services, whose selection procedure included tests in the knowledge of botany, zoology and geology, brought many British naturalists to India. Some collected species on behalf of British and other European naturalists and museums, while others carried out their studies entirely on their own. Historians have linked the birth of museums to colonialism. These massive collections and their documentation led to the production of numerous works including &quot;The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma&quot; series.

The earliest effort to document the fauna of India was perhaps that of Thomas Hardwicke (1755–1835), a military officer in India who hired local artists to produce a huge collection of illustrations of Indian animals. This was subsequently studied by John Edward Gray (1800–1875) and led to the publication of &quot;Illustrations of Indian zoology: chiefly selected from the collection of Major-General Hardwicke&quot; and consisted of 202 colour plates.

A large and growing number of naturalists with an interest in sharing observations led to the founding of the Bombay Natural History Society in 1883.
During this era many Indian princes also took to large scale hunting and together with British hunters, many species of wildlife were hunted to near extinction while some species such as the Cheetah became extinct.

===Paleontology===
The study of geology was of great interest during the colonial period. Rich coal bearing seams, gold and other minerals became much sought after resources. This led to the formation of the Geological Survey of India, the first superintendent of which was Thomas Oldham (1816–1878). With his interest in fossils, especially after his discovery of &quot;Oldhamia&quot;, he took considerable interest in the palaeontological aspects of India. He recruited Ferdinand Stoliczka to work on the Jurassic beds of Kutch. The work of this generation of geologists led to globally significant discoveries including support for continental drift and the idea of a Gondwana supercontinent.

===Birds===

The study of birds in India during the colonial period began with hunting and it was only later that more careful observations were made. Many civil servants and army officers took an interest in hunting for sport and often made notes on the birds that they shot while some of the more interesting species were skinned and sent back to museums in England for identification.

Early studies were made by Major Franklin in 1831 (Proc. Zool. Soc., 1831) followed by Colonel W. H. Sykes with a Catalogue of the Birds of the Bombay Deccan (Proc. Zool. Soc., 1832) and Samuel Tickell with a List of the Birds of Borabhum and Dholbum (Journal. Asiat. Society, 1833). Most of the identification work was however done back in England.

Local systematic ornithology began with Thomas C. Jerdon (1811–1872) in southern India and later Allan Octavian Hume (1829–1912) who established a network of ornithologists in India, with the help of an ornithological journal for the region, &quot;Stray Feathers&quot;, in which he described new species and edited notes from contributors across the region.

The large and widespread collection efforts of ornithologists spread around the region were deposited in the British Museum and in 1889, Blanford commented on the importance of the collection for Indian ornithology:
The famous names in the ornithology of the Indian subcontinent during this era include 
* Andrew Leith Adams (1827–1882),
* Edward Blyth (1810–1873),
* Edward Arthur Butler (1843–1916),
* Douglas Dewar (1875–1957),
* N. F. Frome (1899–1982),
* Hugh Whistler (1889–1943)
* H. H. Godwin-Austen (1834–1923)
* Col. W. H. Sykes(1790–1872)
* C. M. Inglis (1870–1954)
* Frank Ludlow (1885–1972)
* E. C. Stuart Baker (1864–1944)
* Henry Edwin Barnes (1848–1896)
* F. N. Betts (1906–1973)
* H. R. Baker (1869-1949)
* W. E. Brooks (1828–1899)
* Margaret Cockburn (1829–1928)
* James A. Murray
* E. W. Oates (1845–1911)
* Ferdinand Stoliczka (1838–1874)
* Valentine Ball (1843–1894)
* W. T. Blanford (1832–1905)
* J. K. Stanford (1892–1971)
* Charles Swinhoe (1836–1923)
* Robert Swinhoe (1836–1877)
* C. H. T. Marshall (1841–1927)
* G. F. L. Marshall (1843–1934)
* R. S. P. Bates (1897–1961)
* James Franklin (1783–1834)
* Satya Churn Law
* Arthur Edward Osmaston (1885–1961)
* Bertram Beresford Osmaston (1868–1961)
* Wardlaw Ramsay (1852–1921)
* Samuel Tickell (1811–1875).

Several comprehensive works were written by Jerdon, Hume, Marshall and E. C. S. Baker. Popular works were also written by Frank Finn, Douglas Dewar and Hugh Whistler. Those who joined the Indian Civil Services in later years had access to these works and this period was mostly dominated by their short notes in journals published by organisations such as the BNHS, Asiatic Society and the BOU.

===Mammals===
Like the birds, the study of mammals was largely driven by hunters and for a while it was largely restricted to trophy hunting. It was perhaps when R. C. Wroughton, a forest officer who began a concerted study of the small mammals of India through the network of members of the Bombay Natural History Society, that mammalogy in India began in real earnest. He was initially interested in Hymenoptera, especially ants and later scorpions. His interest in scorpions led him to R. I. Pocock. At the time, Pocock was in charge of the Arachnida although he was interested in mammals. Attempts to start a large scale collection effort did not take off. In 1904 Captain Glen Liston of the Indian Medical Service read a paper on &quot;Plague, Rats and Fleas&quot; in which he noted the lack of information on rodents. Another paper by Dr Hossack of the plague department appeared. This interest in plague suddenly enabled the BNHS to raise funds for collection of small mammals. While hunters sent in many specimens for identification, there were a few who studied the habits of species in the wild. A major study of the rodents and bats was conducted by George Edward Dobson (1848–1895) a medical doctor by profession. Other notable mammalologists included Richard Lydekker (1849–1915), Robert Armitage Sterndale, Stanley Henry Prater (1890–1960) and Brian Houghton Hodgson (1800–1894). Richard Lydekker worked with the Geological survey of India and his primary focus during the period was on the fossil mammals of India.

Live animals were sent from India to collections in Britain. The famous rhinoceros Clara came from Assam through the Nawab of Dhaka to Jan_Albert_Sichterman. Two rhinoceroses were sent from Chittagong in 1872 at the cost of £1,250. The Indian aristocracy who maintained their own menageries became contributors to such collections. Rajah Rajendra Mullick of Calcutta was made a Corresponding Member of the Zoological Society of London around 1860. In 1901 His Highness Sir Prabhu Narani Singh, Bahadur, G.C.I.E., Maharajah of Benares, who promised a supply of Indian elephants when required was elected an Honorary Member of the Society.

Some work was also done on captive animals in the few zoos of the time. The foremost among these zoos was Alipore Zoological Gardens and significant work in captive breeding was done by the first superintendent of the zoo, Ram Brahma Sanyal (1858–1908).
===Reptiles and amphibians===

The study of reptiles and amphibians were not as advanced as those of the mammals and birds. Only the poisonous reptiles were of some interest to the British army and the attached physicians. Major contributions to the study of species and their distributions were made by Patrick Russell (1726–1805), the &quot;father of Indian ophiology&quot;, Colonel R. H. Beddome (1830–1911), Frank Wall (1868–1950), Joseph Fayrer (1824–1907) and H. S. Ferguson (1852–1921).

===Invertebrates===

The earliest entomological studies in India were on termites in 1779 by Koenig and lac (1781 by James Kerr) insects. The amateur study of insects in India was initially restricted to the butterflies thanks to the collection craze back in England. An early example being Edward Donovan&#x27;s &quot;An epitome of the insects of India&quot;. A great number army officers and civil servants maintained collections. Sir Winston Churchill for instance made a small collection of 65 butterfly species during a short stint in Bangalore. Lepidopterists include Edward Yerbury Watson (?–1897) who took an interest in the Hesperiidae, Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1906–1963), T. R. Bell (1863–1948) and Charles B. Antram (1864–1955). However entomology beyond butterfly collection gained importance due to the growing economic importance of agriculture. The position of an Imperial Entomologist was created at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute (later the Indian Agricultural Research Institute). Entomologists who left a mark include William Stephen Atkinson (1820–1876), E. Brunetti (1862–1927), Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher (1878–1950), Sir George Hampson (1860–1936), H. E. Andrewes (1863–1950), G. M. Henry (1891–1983), Colonel C. T. Bingham (1848–1908), William Monad Crawford (1872–1941), W. H. Evans (1876–1956), Michael Lloyd Ferrar, F. C. Fraser (1880–1963), Harold Maxwell-Lefroy (1877–1925), Frederic Moore (1830–1907), Samarendra Maulik (1881–1950), Lionel de Nicéville (1852–1901), Ronald A. Senior-White ( 1891–1954), Edwin Felix Thomas Atkinson (1840–1890) and Charles Swinhoe (1836–1923). With forests being of major economic value, there was an interest in forest entomology. Forest entomology started with E. P. Stebbing (1870–1960) and he was followed by many including A. D. Imms (1880–1949), who is better known for his entomology textbook that continues with new revisions to remain a standard reference. Other entomologists associated with forest entomology included C. F. C. Beeson. Malaria was a widespread disease and studies on mosquitoes gained special importance. Ronald Ross (1857–1932) established the link between mosquitoes and malaria during his researches when positioned at Bangalore, Ootacamund and Secunderabad. Sir S. R. Christophers (1873–1978) pioneered in the study of mosquitoes and was involved in the creation of the &quot;Malaria Survey of India&quot;. Others involved in this field included J. A. Sinton (1884–1956).

There was also considerable interest in molluscs partly due to their importance in palaeontology and also due to the economic importance of the damage they caused to ships. Work on these areas was carried out by several malacologists including Baini Prashad.

===Fish===

The study of fish in India was also initially restricted to that which was of commercial value. Sport fishing was also popular but restricted to major hill areas. Not much is documented of the sport fishing beyond record catches reported in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Notable publications on the fishes of India were made by Sir Francis Day (1829–1889), Captain Robert Cecil Beavan (1841–1870) and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829). Some works on sport fishing were also published with several notable works by Henry Sullivan Thomas.

===Flora and forests===
The forests of India were some of the richest resources in the British colonies. The value of forests was realised very early and forest management was introduced early on the sub-continent. The links between water, climate and forest cover were noted particularly early and warnings on deforestation were sounded as early as 1840 by surgeons in the East India Company like Edward Balfour. This was to lead to forest conservation measures although the later policies of forest management were aimed at the production of commercial products such as teak timber. The post of a &quot;conservationist&quot; was created and this term was related to the patches of forests that they managed, called &quot;conservancies&quot;, and was not related to &quot;biodiversity conservation&quot;. Even today, vast tracts of Indian forests are covered with teak plantations, low in biodiversity and seasonally ravaged by forest fires. The first foresters in India were highly influenced by forest management in Germany and many forest officers in India were trained in the German school of thought brought into India by Dietrich Brandis (1824–1907)-&quot;the father of tropical forestry&quot;. Numerous officers including James Sykes Gamble (1847–1925), Alexander Gibson and Hugh Francis Cleghorn in the Indian Forest service added information on the flora of India. Several &quot;amateurs&quot; also worked alongside from other civil services and they were assisted by professional botanists such as Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911), John Gerard Koenig (1728–1785), Robert Wight (1796–1872), Nathaniel Wallich (1786–1854) and William Roxburgh (1751–1815), the &quot;Father of Indian Botany&quot;. Another area of interest was the introduction of plants of economic importance to India. Many of these introductions were tried in botanical gardens at Sibpur, Poona, Madras and Saharanpur. The Chinese monopoly on tea was ended when tea was introduced in Darjeeling and Sri Lanka through the work of Robert Fortune (1812–1880). The botanical garden at Sibpur in Calcutta was started in 1787 by Col. Robert Kyd (1746–1793). Sir George King (1840–1904) who was in charge of the garden from 1871 was instrumental in the creation of a herbarium at the garden and founded the Botanical Survey of India in 1890. Later botanical workers include the paleobotanist Birbal Sahni (1891–1949).

Some of the other prominent names associated with botany and forests of India include William Carey (1761–1834), Sir Henry Collett (1836–1901), Ethelbert Blatter (1877—1934), T. F. Bourdillon, Sir Harry Champion and his brother F. W. Champion (1893–1970), A. A. Dunbar-Brander (Conservator of Forests in the Central Provinces), Sir Walter Elliot (1803–1887), Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1765–1837), Charles McCann (1899–1980), Hugh Falconer( 1808–1865), Philip Furley Fyson (1877–1947), Lt. Col. Heber Drury, William Griffith (1810–1845), Sir David Prain (1857–1944), J. F. Duthie, P. D. Stracey, Richard Strachey (1817–1908), Thomas Thomson (1817–1878), J. E. Winterbottom, W. Moorcroft and J.F. Royle (1799–1858). Naturalists associated with the Bombay Natural History Society like W. S. Millard (1864–1952) helped popularise the study of trees with books such as &quot;Some Beautiful Indian Trees&quot; (coauthored with Ethelbert Blatter). Similar attempts were made by civil servants like Alexander Kyd Nairne in his &quot;Flowering plants of Western India&quot; (1894).

Several herbaria were created during this time and one of the largest and still surviving ones is the Blatter Herbarium.

===Hunter-naturalists===
Hunting was a way of life in colonial India and people from different walks of life wrote about their hunts and their observations in the wild. Many of them were talented writers who left behind their hunting lore in various publications. These include Kenneth Anderson (1910–1974) and Douglas Hamilton (1818–1892) in southern India, F. M. Bailey (1882–1967) and Major R. W. G. Hingston (1887–1966) in the Himalayas, Jim Corbett (1875–1955) in the foothills of the Himalayas, R. C. Morris (1894–1977) in the Biligirirangan Hills and George P. Sanderson in central India. Lieutenant Colonel R. W. Burton along with Colonel R. C. Morris, later became involved in conservation and participated in the early discussions of the Indian Board for Wildlife.
There were also much travelled hunters like Richard Meinertzhagen (1878–1967) who contributed to various other fields such as ornithology. Numerous other hunters wrote to the BNHS journal and not all of their observations were accurate.

===Travelling naturalists and collectors===
India was on the route for explorers and travellers in the region and many collectors from different countries travelled through India. These include such naturalists as Jean de Thévenot (1633–1667), Pierre Sonnerat (1748–1814), Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour (1773–1826), Alfred Duvaucel (1793–1825), William Doherty (1857–1901), Victor Jacquemont (1801–1832) and Frank Kingdon-Ward (1885–1958).

===Popularizers===
There were a few naturalists who were especially gifted writers and made the study of natural history immensely more popular. The foremost among these writers was Edward Hamilton Aitken (1851–1909) who wrote under the pen name of Eha. The novelist Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) also captured the imagination of many with &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Others like H. M. Phipson (1850–1936) helped build organisations like the BNHS and museums such as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India.
===Museum workers===
Several museums were started in India including one at the Asiatic Society in Calcutta. There were also many who worked in the British Museum in London and received specimens collected from India. They made significant contributions by their publications. Edward Blyth (1810–1873) and Nelson Annandale (1876–1924) made great contributions working out of the Asiatic Society while Sir Norman Boyd Kinnear (1882–1957) worked at the BNHS. Other notable museum curators and workers include Alfred William Alcock (1859–1933), John Anderson (1833–1900), George Albert Boulenger (1858–1937), W. L. Distant (1845–1922), Frederic Henry Gravely (1885–?), John Gould (1804–1881), Albert C. L. G. Günther (1830–1914), Frank Finn (1868–1932), Charles McFarlane Inglis (1870–1954), Stanley Wells Kemp (1882–1945), James Wood-Mason (1846–1893), Reginald Innes Pocock (1863–1947), Richard Bowdler Sharpe (1847–1909), Malcolm A. Smith (1875–1958) and Nathaniel Wallich (1786–1854).

==Post-Independence (1947–1970)==

===Ornithologists===

Post independence ornithology was dominated by Salim Ali and his cousin Humayun Abdulali who worked with the Bombay Natural History Society. Salim Ali worked with American collaborators like Sidney Dillon Ripley and Walter Norman Koelz to produce what is still the most comprehensive handbook of Indian ornithology. Another major contribution was the introduction of field ornithology and pioneers included Horace Alexander. The Zoological Survey of India also conducted its own collection surveys and they were led by Biswamoy Biswas. Eastern India and Burma was covered by ornithologists like Bertram E. Smythies.

===Entomologists===
The tradition of entomology started in the colonial era continued with numerous entomologists especially specialising on economically important insects (mostly pests). Notable entomologists of this era include M. S. Mani and B. K. Tikader. The latter contributed greatly to Indian arachnology.

===Ichthyologists===
One of the foremost ichthyologist of India was Sunderlal Hora, famous for his &quot;Satpura hypothesis&quot; a biogeographical hypothesis based on his observations on the adaptations of hill stream fishes. P. R. Awati and D. V. Bal worked on marine fishes of the Western Coastal Plains. Other prominent ichthyologists included C. V. Kulkarni and S. B. Setna.

===Herpetologists===
C. R. Narayan Rao worked on the frogs of southern India. Romulus Whitaker and J. C. Daniel studied various aspects of the reptile fauna of India.

===Scientists from other disciplines===
A large number of scientists from various other fields contributed to the study of plants and animals in India. Among these were some who worked in interdisciplinary areas. Foremost among these was J. B. S. Haldane, the British scientist who encouraged field biology in India on the basis that it was useful while at the same time requiring low investment unlike other branches of science. He was among the first to popularise quantitative approaches to biology in India.

===Popularizers===
Natural history in India was made more popular through publications in the mass media. In southern India M. Krishnan who was a pioneering black-and-white wildlife photographer and artist wrote articles on various aspects of natural history in Tamil and English. His articles were well illustrated with his photographs and artwork. He wrote in a humorous style much like that of EHA before him. Professor K. K. Neelakantan was another writer who popularised the study of birds in Kerala by writing books and articles in Malayalam. Others like Harry Miller wrote in English in the local newspapers. Some others like Ruskin Bond wrote about the wilderness, the hills and the wildlife in a more romantic style.

Zafar Futehally started the first birdwatchers&#x27; newsletter in the 1950s and this helped network the birdwatcher community spread across India. Of this newsletter, Horace Alexander wrote:
Wildlife photography has also helped in popularizing natural history. Numerous photographers have contributed to this and prominent names include Loke Wan Tho, E. Hanumantha Rao, M. Krishnan and T. N. A. Perumal. They followed in the footsteps of the early pioneers of photography such as E. H. N. Lowther, O. C. Edwards and F. W. Champion.

===Conservationists===
In the post-independence era the urgent need to preserve the little remaining wildlife was realised by the politicians of the time. Conservationists of fame included E. P. Gee (1904–1968) who worked on the Indian Board of Wildlife. In later times, large numbers of people became involved in conservation and its various aspects – scientific, social, legal and political. (See also Conservation movement)

<text>HM Prison Bendigo was a medium security prison facility located in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia. Constructed in the early 1863, the prison officially closed in 2004, and has since been converted into Ulumbarra Theatre, one of the city&#x27;s largest performing arts venues. Construction on the prison began in the late 1850s and was originally housed both male and female inmates before they were relocated in 1896. In 1942, the prison was handed over to the Commonwealth Government for use as a military prison, though this arrangement ended in 1947. In 1950, the facility underwent refurbishment to be reopened as a state government prison again.

<text>Captain David Reginald Younger, VC (17 March 1871 – 11 July 1900) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background and early military career==

He was the son of David Younger (1844–1883) and his wife Menie Isadora Younger (1849–1931). His father died when he was only 12 years old.

Younger was educated at St Ninian&#x27;s School, Moffat and Malvern College (1885 – 1890). He was commissioned in 1891 and transferred to the Gordon Highlanders on 23 December 1893. Promoted to lieutenant during the mid 1890s, he left for active service in South Africa following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, and was promoted to captain on 14 December 1899.

==Details==

Younger was 29 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, the Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the Second Boer War when the deed described below took place near Krugersdorp for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (posthumously) after he died of injuries received during the Battle of Dwarsvlei on 11 July 1900:
The Gordon Highlanders under Major-General Smith-Dorrien were ordered to march from Krugersdorp towards Hekpoot. About 15 km from Krugersdorp they were encountered by a commando under Vecht-Generaal Oosthuizen who opened fire from mountain ridges above the road. The battle was fierce and it was only after dark that the British managed to extricate their guns, wagons and wounded and limped back to Krugersdorp. The engagement was described by Major-General Horace Smith-Dorrien as their &#x27;most trying fight of the whole war&#x27;.

His citation in the London Gazette reads:
The Victoria Cross was awarded by King George V on his coronation day, 9 August 1902, the king giving the medal to his widowed mother. D R Younger is also memorialised on his parents grave in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh.

<doc id="1186519" wikidata="Q6082043" url="?curid=1186519" title="Islam in the United Arab Emirates">
<text>Islam is the official religion of the United Arab Emirates. Of the total population, 76.9% are Muslims as of a 2010 estimate by the Pew Research Center. Although no official statistics are available for the breakdown between Sunni and Shia Muslims among noncitizen residents, media estimates suggest less than 20 percent of the noncitizen Muslim population are Shia.

== History ==
The arrival of envoys from the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 632 heralded the conversion of the region to Islam. After prophet Muhammad&#x27;s death, one of the major battles of the Ridda Wars was fought at Dibba, to the east coast of the present-day Emirates. The defeat of the non-Muslims, including Laqit bin Malik Al-Azdi, in this battle resulted in the triumph of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula.

The Bani Yas, which today form the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Emirate of Dubai, traditionally adhere to the Sunni Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence from the Uyunid dynasty, who spread the Maliki school by the command of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni. The four emirates of Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah, and Ajman follow the Hanbali school, and the Emirate of Fujairah follows the Shafi&#x27;i school.

== Structure ==
The federal General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (Awqaf) oversee the administration of Sunni mosques, except in Dubai, where they are administered by the Dubai’s Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD). The Awqaf distributes weekly guidance to Sunni imams regarding the themes and content of khutbah with a published script every week. The khutbas get posted on the Awqaf website. The Awqaf applies a three-tier system in which junior imams follows the Awqaf khutbah script closely; midlevel imams prepare khutbas according to the topic or subject matter selected by Awqaf authorities; and senior imams have the flexibility to choose their own subject for their khutbas. Some Shia religious leaders in Shia majority mosques choose to follow Awqaf-approved weekly addresses, while others write their own khutbah. The government funds and supports Sunni mosques, with the exception of those considered private, and employs all Sunni imams as employees.

Islamic studies are mandatory for all students in public schools and for Muslim students in private schools. The government-funded public schools do not provide instruction in any religion other than Islam. In private schools, non-Muslim students are not required to attend Islamic study classes. As an alternative, private schools are available for non-Muslims. Christian-affiliated schools are authorized to provide instruction tailored to the religious background of the student such as Christian instruction for Christian students, and ethics or other religions.

The Awqaf operates official toll-free call centers and text messaging service for fatwas. The fatwas in the United Arab Emirates are available in three languages (Arabic, English, and Urdu). Fatwas are given based on the questions asked and includes fatwas in areas of belief and worship, business, family, women’s issues, and other issues. Callers explain their question directly to an official mufti, who then issue a fatwa based on the caller&#x27;s question. Both female (muftiya) and male (mufti) religious scholars are available.

For Muslims, the Sharia is the principal source of legislation. However, the judicial system allows for different types of law, depending on the case. Sharia forms the basis for judicial decisions in most family law matters for Muslims, such as marriage and divorce, and inheritance for Muslims. However, in the case of non-Muslims and noncitizens, the laws of their home country apply, rather than Sharia. The law does not directly prohibit Muslims from converting to other religions; however, the penal code defers to Sharia on matters defined as crimes in Islamic doctrine, which in many interpretations prohibits apostasy.

== Shia==

The Jaafari Affairs Council manages the Shia affairs for all of the country, including overseeing mosques and endowments. The council also issues additional instructions on khutbas to Shia mosques. The government does not appoint religious leaders for Shia mosques. Shia adherents worship and maintain their own mosques and the government considers Shia mosques to be private. However, Shia mosques are eligible to receive funding from the government upon request. The government allows Shia mosques to broadcast the Shia adhan from their minarets. Shia Muslims have their own council, the Jaafari Affairs Council, to manage Shia
affairs, including overseeing mosques and community activities, managing financial affairs, and hiring preachers. The government permits Shia Muslims to observe Ashura in private gatherings, but not in public rallies.

Shia Islam is practiced by approximately 5-10% of Emiratis. It is also practiced among expatriate Muslim communities living in the country, most notably Iranians, as well as some Arabs, Pakistanis, Indians, and other nationalities. Non-Twelver Shia branches such as Ismailis and the Dawoodi Bohras are also present.

== Month of Ramadan ==
During the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to publicly eat, drink, chew or smoke between dawn and sunset. Exceptions are made for pregnant women, children, and diabetics or anyone else who cannot fast. The law applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and failure to respect the Islamic tradition results in fines. Designated cafes and restaurants operate in the morning but with decreased operation hours and cater to non-Muslims or people who are not fasting.

<text>Sati Pradha Mela (pattharon ka mela) is an annual fair celebrated in the formerly princely state of Dhami, currently part of the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. The fair is celebrated a day after Diwali in Halog, the erstwhile capital of the princely state, along with members of the Jamog, a neighboring village. 

== History ==
The exact date or year of the fair&#x27;s origin is unknown. The locals believe that the fair goes back a few centuries. Some sources say that the festival originated in the early 18th century when human sacrifice was common in the worship of goddess Kali. The practice was stopped in the later years when a queen of the Rana family of the Dhami kingdom committed &quot;sati&quot; to prevent human sacrifice and instead asked for the two warring groups to pelt stones at each other, and the blood of the wounded person was to be applied as &quot;tilak&quot; to the goddess&#x27; idol as a symbol of sacrifice.

As per another legend, a girl from the Halog village was engaged to be married to the prince of the Rangoli state but the residents of the Jamog village poisoned the prince right before the wedding was to be solemnized. The girl jumped on the funeral pyre of the prince and committed &quot;sati&quot;.

== Rituals ==
The fair and festival begins a day after Diwali. Two teams are created: one team consists of the &quot;Halogis&quot; and clan members from &quot;Tundu&quot;, &quot;Dhagoi&quot;, and &quot;Katedu&quot;, and the second team consists of the &quot;Jamogis&quot;. Only the village warriors, known as &quot;Khunds&quot;, and the members of the royal family can participate in the rituals. From the temple seat of god Narsingh located within the Dhami palace, the &quot;Halogis&quot; take out a procession along with the &quot;Jamogis&quot; and proceed towards the temple grounds of goddess Kali where the queen is believed to have had committed &quot;sati&quot;. It is here that both the warrior groups symbolically shower stones at each other from a distance of 160 to 200 meters. The duration could be from a couple of minutes to an hour. Members of the royal family pelt the first stone after completing &quot;puja&quot; at the temple and it stops only when a person starts bleeding. The blood from the injured person is used to apply &quot;tilak&quot; on the idol of the goddess. People from Shimla and adjoining villages come to watch the rituals.

Women are allowed to participate as spectators only. Local police and doctors are available in modern times to manage the crowd and treat the injured. The royal family of Dhami, along with local members, continues to oversee and organize the fair and its traditions through their local committee.

== Fair ==
Apart from the traditional fair customs and rituals, exhibition of farming equipment and artefacts are also organized during the time to give a boost to the local economy and improve the livelihood of local potters, artisans, and farmers.

For the first time in almost 250 years, the Sati Pradha Mela was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All rituals, possessions, gatherings, and exhibitions were brought to a halt.

<doc id="1186524" wikidata="Q5635234" url="?curid=1186524" title="HM Prison Morwell River">
<text>A nursery and workers camp was established by the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) in 1949 at Olsens Bridge at the head of the Morwell River, which is just east of Boolarra in Victoria. 

The nursery was established to grow mountain ash seedlings for the Strzelecki Ranges reforestation scheme.

The scheme, which began in the early 1930s, ran quietly and successfully for nearly 60 years and is believed to have been the largest and most sustained reforestation project of its type in Australia. 

The FCV workers camp was later to become the HM Morwell River Prison in May 1961, where up to 80 inmates worked in the nursery and planted seedlings across the Strzeleckis under the guidance of FCV employees.

The Prison was a &quot;Minimum Security&quot; facility and escapes occurred in 1962, 1967 and 1968. 

Reputation has it that prisoners often secretly made their way to the Boolarra Hotel, and even as far as Morwell Shopping Centre. It&#x27;s also rumoured the inmates brewed moonshine in the nearby bush.. 

Guards were, at times, not above joining prisoners in their illicit meals. On at least one occasion in 1968, staff and inmates at Morwell River Camp stole a number of sheep from a neighbour’s paddock. This misdemeanour was taken very seriously and resulted in a prosecution by the Forests Commission.

Probably its most notable inmates were media commentator Derryn Hinch in 1987, followed by prominent football umpire Harry Beitzel in 1994.

The nursery was run separately by the Forests Commission, and at it height in the mid-1970s produced in excess of one million seedlings each year.

However an internal review of the Department‘s extensive nursery operations in 1991 recommended the closure of Olsens Bridge, which ceased soon after. Seedlings were then sourced from HM Won Wron Prison nursery near Yarram.

The Morwell River Prison closed in 1997 and the remaining inmates transferred to a newly built Fulham Correctional Centre near Sale. 

The prison complex was then used briefly, and unsuccessfully, as a school adventure camp but the site deteriorated quickly and became overgrown with blackberries and scrub, so that by 2006 only a few dilapidated buildings and bare concrete slabs remained visible. The land was sold in 2008.

<doc id="1186526" wikidata="Q1726234" url="?curid=1186526" title="Robert E. White">
<text>Robert Edward White (September 21, 1926 – January 14, 2015) was an American career diplomat who served as US Ambassador to Paraguay (1977–1980) and to El Salvador (1980–1981). He was recalled from El Salvador by incoming US President Ronald Reagan due to White&#x27;s opposition to killings committed by the El Salvadoran military. He then became president of the Center for International Policy.

==Background and family life==
He was born in Melrose, Massachusetts. White served in the US Navy from 1944 to 1946, and after the war benefitted from the G.I. Bill. He graduated from Saint Michael&#x27;s College in 1952, and after a Fulbright Scholarship graduated from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1954.

White died at a hospice on January 14, 2015, aged 88, due to bladder and prostate cancer. He was married to Mary-Anne White and had five children and three grandchildren.

==Career==
Joining the United States Foreign Service in 1955, White served in a variety of positions at the State Department and in US delegations, primarily in Latin America. Postings included Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Nicaragua. From 1968 to 1970 he served as Peace Corps deputy regional director and then regional director, for the Latin America region. From 1975 to 1977 he was Deputy U.S. Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States. In October 1977 he was nominated by President Jimmy Carter as US Ambassador to Paraguay.

Throughout his career, White provided the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Trainings with an oral history of his various duties in Latin America.

===Paraguay (1977–1980)===

==== 1978 cable concerning operation Condor ====
On March 6, 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the existence of a recently declassified 1978 cable from Robert White, at the time the U.S. ambassador to Paraguay. Professor J. Patrice McSherry of Long Island University described the discovery as &quot;another piece of increasingly weighty evidence suggesting that U.S. military and intelligence officials supported and collaborated with Condor as a secret partner or sponsor&quot;.

In the cable, Ambassador White relates a conversation with General Alejandro Fretes Dávalos, chief of staff of Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces, who told him that the South American intelligence chiefs involved in Condor &quot;keep in touch with one another through a U.S. communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone which covers all of Latin America&quot;. This installation was &quot;employed to co-ordinate intelligence information among the southern cone countries&quot;. White, whose message was sent to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, was concerned that the US connection to Condor might be revealed during the then ongoing investigation into the deaths of Orlando Letelier and his American colleague, Ronni Moffitt. &quot;It would seem advisable&quot;, he suggests, &quot;to review this arrangement to ensure that its continuation is in US interest&quot;.

===El Salvador (1980–1981)===
In 1980–81, he was posted to El Salvador during the first years of that country&#x27;s brutal 12-year civil war. He was harshly critical of the Salvadorian government and accused the military and paramilitaries (widely alleged to have close ties) of committing widespread atrocities against civilians, many of which were later factually confirmed. He once called prominent military figure Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson a &quot;pathological killer&quot;. D&#x27;Aubuisson was widely suspected of collaboration with death squad killings including the assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero. White also accused José Napoleón Duarte, El Salvador&#x27;s president from 1984 to 1989 of being a CIA asset.

He was dismissed by the new Reagan administration in 1981. He wrote of his ouster:

In 1981, as the ambassador to El Salvador, I refused a demand by the secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr., that I use official channels to cover up the Salvadoran military&#x27;s responsibility for the murders of four American churchwomen. I was fired and forced out of the Foreign Service.

===Post-diplomatic career===
After retiring from the Foreign Service in 1981, White served as a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He was also Professor of International Relations at Simmons College in Boston, and an election observer in Haiti&#x27;s 1987 general election. He was at one time President of the International Center for Development Policy, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank.

In 1990, he joined the Center for International Policy as the President and presided at conferences, led delegations to several Latin American and Caribbean countries and published numerous studies regarding U.S. policy towards the region. In 1999, he stated his criticism of U.S. policy:In the name of anticommunism, U.S.-supported armies suppressed democracy, free speech, and human rights in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Torture and assassination of democratic leaders, including presidential candidates, journalists, priests and union officials became commonplace.
Additionally, White led an ongoing effort to reform U.S. intelligence agencies.

==Awards==
* St. Michael&#x27;s Col. Cook award.
* Honorary degree of Doctor of Political Science from Providence College

==In popular culture==
In the 1983 TV movie dramatizing the murder of the four missionaries &quot;Choices of the Heart&quot;, Ambassador White is portrayed by Mike Farrell.

In Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1986 film dramatization of the Salvadoran Civil War, &quot;Salvador&quot;, the character &quot;Ambassador Tom Kelly&quot; (played by Michael Murphy) is based on Robert White, who appeared in the 62-minute retrospective documentary &quot;Into the Valley of Death&quot;, which was included on the 2001 DVD release of &quot;Salvador&quot;. Despite pointing out some of the fictional aspects of &quot;Salvador&quot;, White was complimentary of Stone&#x27;s film overall by noting that it captured the pervading sense of doom that surrounded the real-life events. In the documentary, White also re-iterated his criticisms of the activities of US intelligence and the Reagan administration in El Salvador.

<doc id="1186527" wikidata="Q7419177" url="?curid=1186527" title="Santa Ana Winds Youth Band">
<text>The Santa Ana Winds Youth Band was a community youth marching band in Orange County, California. The band&#x27;s name was derived from the Santa Ana winds weather pattern, and is a reference to the fact that the many performers use wind instruments.

== Band history ==
The band was started in 1971 by Robert Ward (d. May 31, 2008) and quickly grew to become a staple group in parades across Southern California.

On October 20, 1971, the Board of Managers of the Santa Ana/Tustin Y.M.C.A. approved the band as an affiliate club. The Winds were appointed as the &quot;Official Ambassadors of Music for Orange County&quot; by the Board of Supervisors of Orange County, and still hold that distinguished title.

The 2007-2008 season was the 37th season of The Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, and was under the direction of Greg Rochford. The 2010-2011 season was under the direction of Anna Sintora and Abel Acosta as Co-Band Directors.

== Performances ==
The Santa Ana Winds have performed in hundreds of events over their 35 years serving the community. They have performed in parades, field shows, and concerts throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.

The band has marched in the Hollywood Christmas Parade for over thirty-two years. They have appeared in such films as Coneheads, First Daughter, a Sprung Monkey video, S.F.W., Witch Hunt (1994 film), and an episode of Boston Public, among other events.

The group was a two-time national field show champion. They recorded a record in London during one of their European tours.

==Membership==
No audition was required, and membership was open to any youth ages 14–21. The band accepted all wind instruments, percussion, flag spinners, baton twirlers, drum majors, and banner carriers. Members come from Orange County, Los Angeles County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and some from Imperial County, San Diego County and Ventura County.

<text>The Fauves are an Australian rock band formed in 1988. The band are known for their witty lyrics, melodic pop-rock and often satirical or evocative exploration of Australian themes.

Their album &quot;Future Spa&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Album in the 1997 ARIA awards but lost to Spiderbait&#x27;s &quot;Ivy and the Big Apples&quot;. They played at the Big Day Out in both 1993 and 1997.

In 2007, they played their 1,000th Show and in 2008 they celebrated their 20th Anniversary Gig at The Espy in Melbourne.

==History==
The Fauves were formed in 1988 by four students of Mt Eliza High School, Mornington Peninsula. They were Andrew Cox on guitar and vocals; Andrew &quot;Jack&quot; Dyer on bass guitar; Philip Leonard on guitar, vocals and brass; and Adam Newey on drums. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they &quot;took their name from the short-lived French art movement, Fauvism, which was characterised by both its intensity and infatuation with colour.&quot; Neither Cox nor Leonard had formal music lessons.

Their first gig was on 23 July 1988, at a local football club, Cox later recalled &quot;We learnt more about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in that one night than the entire preceding 20 years. We sucked piss, made eyes at the cheap football tarts and bonded like four buckets of superglue. We also learnt how to compromise, how to sell out, and how to get fucked over. There was no rider, we were underpaid and no one got laid. It was a microcosm of an entire career.&quot; McFarlane declared that the group&#x27;s &quot;early sound was an energetic distillation of garage-punk rock riffs and surreal lyrics.&quot;

In March 1990, the band released their debut five-track extended play, &quot;This Mood Has Passed&quot;, on Timbertop Records. It had been recorded in the previous year at Timbertop Studios, Ringwood, with Peter Carrodus producing. McFarlane felt the EP &quot;reflected the frantic, primal elements of early Hunters &amp; Collectors or Moodists.&quot; They followed in October with a 7&quot; single, &quot;Fireman 451&quot;, on Shock Records, produced by Doug Saunders.

In 1991, they issued two singles, &quot;When Luck Ran Out&quot; and &quot;Daughter Aboard&quot;. In the following year two EPs, both with six-tracks, were issued on Shock Records, &quot;The Scissors Within&quot; (April) and &quot;Tight White Ballhugger&quot; (September), each was produced by Robbie Rowlands. The EPs &quot;kept up the experimental energy and humour.&quot; In 1992 the Fauves featured on a split CD, &quot;Dress Ups&quot; (Shock Records), with other Melbourne bands The Glory Box and Pray TV with each band performing a track from the others&#x27; repertoire, as well as contributing one original track.

Nic Haygarth of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; caught their gig in October 1992, he found &quot;the bald heads of [Dyer] and [Leonard] give them a fiercer appearance, but nothing could be friendlier than the melody of &#x27;Fracture in the Sky&#x27; and Leonard&#x27;s trumpet on their best track &#x27;Wilding&#x27;. The Fauves played strong material from &quot;The Scissors Within&quot; and quirky new stuff from latest EP &quot;Tight White Ballhugger&quot;, including mandolin tempered &#x27;Archimedes&#x27; Crown&#x27;. Doomy distorted guitars powered their set, but the Fauves nearly lost their audience with a couple of extended thrash routines which not even the Brady Bunch theme could redeem.&quot;

During a gig at Sydney&#x27;s Annandale Hotel late in 1992 &quot;they detoured into a freeform noise epic during which Cox washed Newey&#x27;s hair with Vegemite and shampoo.&quot; &quot;The Age&quot;″s Craig Mathieson described their support slot on the Church&#x27;s national tour, &quot;They rehearsed extensively, mindful of the opportunity they had been given. The result? Church fans ignored them.&quot;

The band came to wider attention when they appeared on the bill of the first Big Day Out tour in January 1993. They signed to Polydor Records and, in October of that year, they released their debut long player, &quot;Drive Through Charisma&quot;. It was produced by Rowlands, who had them &quot;recorded in a mud-brick house in Daylesford.&quot; The original version included a 22-track bonus disc featuring early demos and some live songs, which Mathieson felt were &quot;often horrendous early recordings.&quot; It was accompanied by a separate booklet, &quot;22 Reasons Why a Band Shouldn&#x27;t Put an Album Out in Its First Few Years&quot;, written by Newey who provided critical analysis for each track: Mathieson noticed he &quot;ridiculed every song.&quot;

The 1994 computer game Quarantine featured the band&#x27;s song &quot;The Driver Is You&quot; on its soundtrack. Their second album &quot;The Young Need Discipline&quot; was released in 1994. In 1995 the band released a non-album single &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Getting a 3 Piece Together&quot;. The song was later included on the band&#x27;s next album as a secret track.

The Fauves&#x27;s most successful album to date &quot;Future Spa&quot; was released in July 1996. The album yielded considerable radio success with singles &quot;Dogs Are the Best People&quot; and &quot;Self Abuser&quot; coming in at No. 20 and No. 30 respectively in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1996. Between the release of &quot;Future Spa&quot; and their album &quot;Lazy Highways&quot;, the band were filmed for Vanessa Stuart&#x27;s one-hour documentary, &quot;The Fauves: 15 Minutes to Rock&quot;, which has since aired on SBS and was also screened at the Document Film Festival in October 2004.

The band toured heavily throughout the 90s and undertook support slots for overseas touring acts including Morphine, Weezer, Live, The Grifters and Mr. Bungle.

By the end of 1999, however the band was dropped from Polydor after the label&#x27;s merger with Universal. Following their departure from the major label, the band wrote two songs, &quot;Bigger Than Tina&quot; and &quot;Bigger Than Tina II&quot;, for the Australian movie &quot;Bigger Than Tina&quot; which were released as a single on Festival. Since then the group has released seven albums independently. They had further success on the Triple J Hottest 100 with &quot;Bigger Than Tina&quot; at No. 50 in 1999, and &quot;Give Up Your Day Job&quot; at No. 58 in 2000.

The Fauves released their ninth studio album, &quot;When Good Times Go Good&quot;, on 6 September 2008. It was recorded with longtime collaborator Wayne Connolly, who has worked on five of the band&#x27;s nine albums, and co-produced by Jim Moginie from Midnight Oil. A video-clip was made of the &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;.

After a three-year break the band debuted tracks from their tenth album &quot;Japanese Engines&quot; on 10 November 2011 in Geelong. The album was followed only five months later by an eight-track EP &quot;German Engines&quot; launched at The Toff in Town. Andrew Cox announced on stage: &quot;&quot;Japanese Engines&quot; was kind of the poppier record. &quot;German Engines&quot; has a much darker soul, it&#x27;s a bit heavier, it&#x27;s a bit rougher.&quot;

A double album, titled &quot;Driveway Heart Attack&quot;, was released in 2019, their 12th studio album.

In July 2022, the band headlined a Melbourne show. The press releases labeled it &quot;last show till the next one&quot;, the &quot;first show since the last one.&quot;

On 1 September 2023, the Fauves reissued their first two EPs as they were originally intended to be, a full-length album titled &quot;Faematronic.&quot;

The band released their 13th album, &quot;Tropical Strength&quot;, on 1 November 2024. They recorded the album in Indonesia and in the accompanying press, they explained: &quot;Very few Australians have ever been to Bali so we relished the sense of outpost exoticism and a culture completely untouched by Western influence. Here we could work in relative anonymity, far from the complete anonymity that tracks our every move at home.&quot;

<doc id="1186530" wikidata="Q66514" url="?curid=1186530" title="Leonhard Rauwolf">
<text>Leonhard Rauwolf (also spelled Leonhart Rauwolff) (21 June 1535 – 15 September 1596) was a German physician, botanist, and traveller. His main notability arises from a trip he made through the Levant and Mesopotamia in 1573–75. The motive of the trip was to search for herbal medicine supplies. Shortly after he returned, he published a set of new botanical descriptions with an herbarium. Later he published a general travel narrative about his visit.

==Early years==
The young Rauwolff studied initially at University of Wittenberg and then studied botany and medicine at two universities in southern France, University of Montpellier and University of Valence. He was a pupil of Guillaume Rondelet in Montpellier in 1560. In 1564 he had the benefit of visiting the renowned botanist Carolus Clusius (who once had been a student of Rondelet too). In 1565 he set up a medical practice in his hometown, Augsburg, in Bavaria. In that year he married.

==Travel through Levant and Mesopotamia==
Rauwolff&#x27;s travel in the Near East was made possible by his brother-in-law Melchior Manlich, who hoped Rauwolff would come back with new plants and drugs that could be traded profitably by his firm. The Manlich firm already had trading relations with exporters in Tripoli in Lebanon. Rauwolff started his journey by going from Augsburg to Marseilles in southern France, from which he sailed in 1573 to Tripoli in Lebanon. From Tripoli he went to Aleppo, where he stayed for many months. In 1574 he went from Aleppo to Baghdad and Mosul. In 1575 he went back to Aleppo and Tripoli and then on to Jerusalem. He was back in Augsburg in 1576. Rauwolff was the first European botanist of the post-medieval era to travel in Syria and Mesopotamia. Very shortly after his return he published the results of his botanic expeditions in his fourth herbarium &quot;Viertes Kreutterbuech -- darein vil schoene und frembde Kreutter&quot;.
In addition to botanical investigations, Rauwolff observed and recorded his impressions of the people, customs, and sights of the Levantine region. In 1582 he published these as a book in German, &quot;Aigentliche Beschreibung der Raiß inn die Morgenländerin&quot;. The English translation, &quot;Dr. Leonhart Rauwolf&#x27;s Travels into the Eastern Countries&quot; (340 pages) was published in 1693 in a collection of travel narratives compiled by John Ray. Another translation was published in Dutch. Rauwolff was among the first Europeans to describe the drinking of coffee (which was unknown in Europe at the time): &quot;A very good drink they call &quot;Chaube&quot; that is almost as black as ink and very good in illness, especially of the stomach. This they drink in the morning early in the open places before everybody, without any fear or regard, out of China cups, as hot as they can, sipping it a little at a time.&quot; Here is an extract from Rauwolff&#x27;s description of Tripoli in Lebanon:

::The town of Tripoli is pretty large, full of people, and of good account, because of the great deposition of merchandises that are brought thither daily both by sea and land. It is situated in a pleasant country, near the promontory of the high mountain &quot;Libanus&quot;, in a great plain toward the sea-shore, where you may see abundance of vineyards, and very fine gardens, enclosed with hedges for the most part, the hedges consisting chiefly of &quot;Rhamnus, Paliurus, Oxyacantha, Phillyrea, Lycium, Balaustium, Rubus&quot;, and little &quot;Palm-trees&quot;, that are low, and so sprout and spread themselves. In these gardens, as we came in, we found all sorts of salads and kitchen-herbs, such as Endive, Lettuce, Ruckoli, Asparagus, Celery... Tarragon..., Cabbages, Cauliflowers, Turnips, Horseradishes, Carrots, of the greater sort of Fennel, Onions, Garlic, etc. And also fruit, as Water-melons, Melons, Gourds, Citruls, Melongena, Sesamum (by the natives called &quot;samsaim&quot;, the seeds whereof are very much used to strew upon their bread) and many more; but especially the Colocasia, which is very common there, and sold all the year long... In great plenty there are citrons, lemons and oranges... At Tripoli they have no want of water, for several rivers flow down from the mountains, and run partly through the town, and partly through the gardens, so that they want no water neither in the gardens nor in their houses.

==Later years==
In 1588, the leaders of Augsburg reverted to Catholicism, and Rauwolf, a leader of the Protestant opposition, left. He next served as city physician in Linz for 8 years. In 1596 he joined the imperial troops fighting the Turks in Hungary, where he died. He died at Waitzen, the year before a battle there between the Austrians and Turks in 1597.

The plant genus &quot;Rauvolfia&quot; Plum. ex L. was named in his honor in the 18th century. The plant genus Alhagi, including its Arabic name, has it origin in Rauwolff&#x27;s botany writings.

<text>Eleanor Wachtel (born 1947 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian writer and broadcaster. She was the host of the flagship literary show &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot; on CBC Radio One, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in October 2015. Her interviews for &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot; are in-depth portraits of literary figures which over the years have included Saul Bellow, Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje and Mordecai Richler. Kazuo Ishiguro, author of &quot;Remains of the Day&quot;, has called Wachtel &quot;one of the very finest interviewers of authors I&#x27;ve come across anywhere in the world.&quot; At the end of their conversation in 2013, John le Carré told her, &quot;You do it better than anyone I know.&quot;

==Early life==
Wachtel was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1947. Interested in books and reading from an early age, she was introduced by her Grade 8 teacher to the works of Shakespeare and Emily Brontë. She found high school intellectually stimulating, &quot;surrounded by gifted classmates with diverse backgrounds&quot;. She studied English literature at McGill University, where she worked for the student newspaper and was on the executive of the Undergraduate Literary Society.

Following McGill, Wachtel enrolled (&quot;partly by default&quot;, she says) in a master&#x27;s in journalism at Syracuse University. On graduation from the journalism program she accompanied her anthropologist husband to Kenya.

==Career==
After living in Kenya, and the United States, she moved in the mid-1970s to Vancouver, where she worked as a freelance writer and broadcaster. During this time, she was adjunct professor of women&#x27;s studies at Simon Fraser University. In the fall of 1987, Wachtel became literary commentator on CBC Stereo&#x27;s &quot;State of the Arts&quot; in Toronto. Her next assignment was as writer-broadcaster for &quot;The Arts Tonight&quot;, reporter for &quot;The Arts Report&quot;. She hosted &quot;The Arts Today&quot; from 1996 to 2007. Wachtel has been host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot; since its inception in 1990.

A selection of Wachtel&#x27;s interviews called &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot; was published in 1993; &quot;More Writers &amp; Company&quot; was published by Knopf Canada in the fall of 1996. In 2003, another selection of her interviews, titled &quot;Original Minds&quot;, was brought out by HarperCollins. In 2016, Biblioasis published &quot;The Best of Writers &amp; Company&quot;.

She is a contributor to the best-selling &quot;Dropped Threads&quot; (2001), edited by Carol Shields and Marjorie Anderson, and &quot;Lost Classics&quot; (2000), edited by Michael Ondaatje and others. In 2007, Wachtel published &quot;Random Illuminations: Conversations With Carol Shields&quot;. Wachtel has co-edited two books: &quot;The Expo Story&quot; (1986), and &quot;Language in Her Eye&quot; (1990), and is the co-author of &quot;A Feminist Guide to the Canadian Constitution&quot; (1992).

Since 2007, Wachtel has also hosted &quot;Wachtel on the Arts&quot; on &quot;Ideas&quot;.

After 33 years hosting &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot;, she announced her retirement in the spring of 2023.

She subsequently served as the jury chair for the 2024 International Booker Prize.

==Awards and honours==
In 2002, Wachtel won the Jack Award for the promotion of Canadian books and authors.

In 2011, &quot;Writers &amp; Company&quot; won a Silver Prize at the New York Festivals for World&#x27;s Best Radio Programs.

Wachtel has been awarded nine honorary degrees, including a Doctor of Literature from Carleton University in Ottawa (2017), a Doctor of Laws from Concordia University in Montreal (2010), a Doctor of Letters from McGill University in Montreal (2009), a Doctor of Laws, from Dalhousie University in Halifax (2007), and the Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C. (2007); Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax (2002); Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver (2001); Athabasca University, Athabasca, Alberta (2000); St. Thomas University, Fredericton (1999). In 2004, Eleanor Wachtel was named to the Order of Canada, and in 2014 she was promoted from Member to Officer.

In 2015, Wachtel was named to the Women&#x27;s Executive Network&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women list in the Arts &amp; Communication field.

<text>The Melbourne Assessment Prison (MAP) is an Australian remand and reception prison located in Spencer Street, West Melbourne, Victoria. The facility is operated by Corrections Victoria.

==Function and history==
The prison is also known by the nickname &#x27;The Map&#x27;. Previously known as the Melbourne Remand Centre, the Melbourne Assessment Prison was originally built to accommodate Melbourne&#x27;s remand prisoners and sits on the site of the former Western Hotel on the corner of Spencer Street and La Trobe Street just west of the Melbourne central business district.

The primary purpose of the facility is to provide statewide assessment and orientation services for all male prisoners received into the prison system.

In 1997 the prison became the main reception prison for all male prisoners in Victoria. Initial planning for the prison commenced in 1974. Construction commenced in December 1983 and was completed in 1989 at a cost of A$80m. The prison was officially opened on 6 April 1989, and received its first prisoners on 29 May 1989.

At least two prisoners have escaped from the Melbourne Assessment Prison. In one incident explosives smuggled into the unit were used to blow open the armoured plastic windows of a cell, while the two inmates hid behind mattresses (see Peter Gibb). Since then steel bars have been added to the windows to prevent a repetition.

The prison has seen a small expansion of its capacity over the years and as of June 2017 it held 305 prisoners.

<doc id="1186538" wikidata="Q5619057" url="?curid=1186538" title="Gunnar Kaasen">
<text>Gunnar Kaasen (March 11, 1882 – November 27, 1960) was a Norwegian-born musher who delivered a cylinder containing 300,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, as the last leg of a dog sled relay that saved the U.S. city from an epidemic.

==Background==
Gunnar E. Kaasen was born the son of Hans and Anna Kaasen in Burfjorddalen, in Troms county, Norway. He went to the United States to mine for gold in 1903, in the wake of the discovery of gold-bearing sands on Cape Nome in 1898, which triggered one of several gold rushes in the state between 1891 and 1898. Kaasen became an experienced musher and a resident of Nome. While the boom was spent by 1905, the port of Nome sits on Norton Sound, which is usually ice locked and inaccessible by ship between October and June. Dog sledding remained the primary transportation and communication link to the outside world during the winter months.

== Last leg of the Great Race of Mercy ==
In 1925, an outbreak of diphtheria threatened Kaasen&#x27;s adopted home, and the disease could easily spread across the northern Alaska villages of which Nome was the hub. The Iñupiaq children in particular had no immunity to the &quot;white man&#x27;s disease&quot;. The port was frozen. No train routes or regular roads extended to the northern coast of Alaska. Bush piloting was in its infancy; the only two aircraft in the state had open-cockpits, and had never been flown in the winter. Given the choices, Governor Scott Bone authorized the transport of 300,000 units of serum in Anchorage to Nenana by train, where it was picked up by the first of twenty mushers and more than one hundred dogs who relayed the serum the remaining 674 miles (1,085 km) to Nome. 
Kaasen was scheduled to transport the 20 pound (9 kg) cylinder of serum along the next-to-last leg of the relay, from Bluff to Point Safety, Alaska. At Bluff, Charlie Olson passed the serum to Kaasen, who left with a team of 13 dogs, led by the husky, Balto. Kaasen traveled through the night, in the middle of winds so severe that his sled flipped over and he almost lost the cylinder containing the serum. Visibility was so poor he could not always see the dogs harnessed closest to the sled.

Kaasen reached Port Safety ahead of schedule on February 2, at 2 Alaska Standard Time. Ed Rohn, the next musher in the relay, was sleeping, so Kaasen pressed on the remaining 25 miles (40 km) to Nome, reaching Front Street at 5:30 . Kaasen traveled a total of 54.3 miles (87 km).

Kaasen gave the serum to Dr. Curtis Welch, the only physician in Nome, who distributed the serum. No further deaths from the disease were reported. A second batch of serum, from Seattle, Washington, arrived in Seward, Alaska, five days later, and was transported to Nome in the same fashion. Prior to 1925, the disease killed 20,000 people a year in the U.S. The worldwide publicity the event received helped spur widespread diphtheria inoculations, which greatly reduced that number.

== Celebrity ==
Like all mushers who participated, Kaasen was given a citation by the Governor of the Alaska Territory. All mushers also received a daily wage from a public fund of between US$30 and $40. H. K. Mulford Company, which manufactured the antitoxin, awarded medals to all participants in the first relay.

Unlike the other mushers, Kaasen became a celebrity. In addition to the medal, the H.K. Mulford Company awarded him $1,000, and he was even offered a role in a movie. Balto became even more famous. On December 17, 1925, a bronze statue of the large black dog was unveiled in Central Park in New York City. Although news sources promoted the idea that this was a statue of Balto, his name does not appear on the dedication plaque, but instead reads, &quot;Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925. Endurance · Fidelity · Intelligence&quot;.

Balto appeared in Madison Square Garden before a crowd of 20,000 people. Another statue was erected in downtown Anchorage, Alaska as well, depicting a sled dog in mid-stride, and though most consider this to be another likeness of Balto, the plaque itself, like the NYC statue never mentions the famous dog and instead is dedicated “to all dog mushers and their heroic dogs.”

Kaasen lived in Everett, Washington, from 1952 to 1960. He was 78 when he died of cancer in 1960. He was buried at Everett&#x27;s Cypress Lawn Memorial Park next to his wife, Anna.

<doc id="1186542" wikidata="Q5635162" url="?curid=1186542" title="HM Prison Dhurringile">
<text>HM Prison Dhurringile was a minimum security prison located in Dhurringile, Victoria, Australia. Situated 160 km north of Melbourne near Murchison, it was based around the historic Dhurringile estate.

==Facilities==
The Dhurringile mansion had not been used to house prisoners since 2007, when new buildings were opened. The main unit was called Kyabram and housed 54 prisoners in cell accommodations. The unit had two sides, South and North. South was the reception side, where all new arrivals were housed prior to being moved into cottage accommodation. The North side was for medical hold prisoners who needed to be located within the unit on a permanent basis.

The prison also contained cottages in both C1 and C2 classifications. The C1 cottages were: Merrigum (1, 2, and 3), Kyouga (1 and 2), Echuca (1, 2, and 3), Tatchera (1, 2, and 3), and Tallygaroopna (1 and 2). Each C1 cottage housed six prisoners, each with their own bedroom. There was a main lounge area with a TV and other amenities. The prisoners in these accommodations collected their meals from the main mess hall every day, as there were no cooking facilities located within the cottages. There were also three C1 self-catered units where cooking was done within the unit.

There were three main C2 units called Garnya (1, 2, and 3), Dhugalla (1, 2, and 3), and Benalla (1, 2, and 3); these units were fully self-catered. Each prisoner had their own bedroom, and there was a large kitchen and living area. The units had two bathrooms and two toilets. Food for these units was ordered off a grocery list, and the unit was allocated $275 per week to buy groceries. Prisoners from these units were not permitted to attend the mess hall for any meals.

There was a 12-bed unit called &#x27;Wyuna&#x27; for long-term C2 prisoners nearing the end of their sentences. Selection was required to enter this unit; prisoners could not simply request placement. The unit was composed of bedrooms with en suites. Like any C2 unit, it was unlocked at night, but prisoners obtained their meals from the mess hall.

===Upgrades===
A new kitchen, medical, library, and administration building was opened in mid-2010. It was a state-of-the-art facility. Musters were then conducted on the balcony of this building instead of in the mansion, where they had previously been held. Most musters at the jail were held at the prisoners&#x27; units or by their doors if they were located in Kyabram. However, all work musters from Monday through Friday were held on this balcony.

A 54-bed expansion was opened by Andrew McIntosh, Minister for Corrections on 31 July 2012.

The prison continued to expand. In January 2014, 50 converted shipping containers were established on-site to house 100 prisoners. Other expansion works were underway in early 2014 to build more permanent accommodation for Victoria&#x27;s growing prisoner population.

==Work==
All prisoners were expected to work while located at the prison. There were a variety of work opportunities. The main two industries were wooden products and metal fabrication, where most prisoners were placed upon reception. Other areas of work included Horticulture (working in the main orchards), Maintenance, Gardening, or &quot;Billet&quot; (cleaner) jobs. 

The prison was also a working dairy farm, with about 15 prisoners working in the dairy. This work involved being woken and let out of their units at 5:30 am to milk the cows. The dairy workers also milked again at about 4 pm. They worked a six-day week with one day off. Dairy workers had their own special canteen times, as they were working during the hours when other prisoners were able to attend the canteen and similar activities.

==History==

HM Prison Dhurringile was established in 1965 when the Government of Victoria acquired the Dhurringile mansion and former estate from the Presbyterian Church of Australia, who had used the site for the then recently-defunct Dhurringile Rural Training Farm. The site had earlier operated as an internment camp and prisoner of war camp during World War II.

==Escapes==
On 15 February 2010, 36-year-old, convicted armed robber Jason Campbell, escaped from the prison.

On 20 September 2013, 35-year-old Eray Aslan escaped but was found on 1 October 2013 in a Footscray home.

On 1 August 2014, 28-year-old Vikramjit Singh escaped from the prison.

==Closure==
Dhurringile Prison closed on 31 August 2024 following a significant reduction in demand for minimum-security beds. People in custody were transferred to other suitable prison locations as part of major reforms to Victoria&#x27;s men’s prison system. Corrections Victoria committed to providing a range of supports for Dhurringile staff, including opportunities to transfer to roles at other prisons, within the Department of Justice and Community Safety (DJCS), or the broader Victorian Public Service

<doc id="1186543" wikidata="Q1531475" url="?curid=1186543" title="Kingston-class coastal defence vessel">
<text>The &quot;Kingston&quot; class consists of 12 coastal defence vessels operated by the Royal Canadian Navy. The class is the name for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project (MCDV). These multi-role vessels were built and launched from the mid- to late-1990s and are crewed by a combination of Naval Reserve and Regular Force personnel. The main missions of the vessels are reservist training, coastal patrol, minesweeping, law enforcement, pollution surveillance and search and rescue. The multi-purpose nature of the vessels led to their mixed construction between commercial and naval standards. The &quot;Kingston&quot; class is split between the east and west coasts of Canada and regularly deploy overseas to West Africa, Europe, Central America and the Caribbean.

In August 2023 it was reported that the Canadian Department of National Defence had &quot;initiated the project to inform timely governmental decision-making about a potential replacement for the Kingston-class.&quot;

==Background==
The &quot;Kingston&quot; class was the result of the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project (MCDV) in the late 1980s. The project came about due to four influences, along with restrictions. The vessels in use by the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve were ageing and needed replacement. At the time, the Maritime Command was using old s, s and s to train reservists, with the vast majority of the ships having begun service in the 1950s and early 1960s. The navy lacked a mine warfare capability. Furthermore, the new s were not capable of inshore and restricted area patrol and finally, the government sought to keep the shipbuilding efforts ongoing, as the frigate program was already well underway.

The MCDV project was also the culmination of a series of political promises offered by then Minister of National Defence Gilles Lamontagne. The government sought to move the National Reserve Headquarters from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Quebec City, Quebec, as part of their effort to increase French representation in the armed forces. The move was to provide a site where French-Canadians could live and work in their native language. Lamontagne faced opposition within the Forces due to Quebec City being far from the existing naval bases and the waters around it freezing during winter months. Lamontagne promised to replace the ships for naval reserve training in order to move the project forward. The program began in the 1987 National Defence White Paper under the concept of &quot;Total Force&quot;. This was intended to mask reductions in the regular force by increasing the capabilities of the reserve forces. This led the navy to add minesweeping and coastal patrol duties to the reserve force&#x27;s list of duties.

==Design and description==
There were five main criteria for the design. The ships had to be built in Canada, they had to be inexpensive to build, they had to be operable by naval reservists, the design had to have role flexibility included, and they had to be inexpensive to operate. This was exemplified by the Royal Navy&#x27;s which was operated by the Royal Navy Reserve. The design originally called for steel-hulled mine countermeasures vessels and training ships. The &quot;Kingston&quot; class was built to naval standards in stability and maneuverability, and in the magazines; but otherwise only to commercial standards, to reduce costs. The ships&#x27; mixed construction is visible in their two square, separated funnels, which were cheaper to manufacture, and their poor seakeeping and large radar signature. The vessels were re-designated MCDV from MM (General Mine Warfare Vessel) when two follow-on programmes of purely minesweeper/hunters were cancelled, denoting their mixed duties.

The ships have a standard displacement of light and fully loaded. During sea trials, the vessels were found to be top heavy and a further of permanent ballast was added. The &quot;Kingston&quot; class measure long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The vessels have a maximum crew of 47, with crew sizes changing depending on the vessel&#x27;s task. The crew is a mix of reservists and regular force personnel, with the regular force personnel assigned to engine room and electronics tasks. The &quot;Kingston&quot; class are equipped with Kelvin Hughes Nucleus S-band surface search radar.

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class use an electric drive system that is powered by four Wärtsilä UD 23V12 diesel engines which are coupled to four Jeumont ANR 53-50-4 alternators, creating 715 kilowatts each. Two Jeumont C1 560 L electric motors provide power to the two LIPS FS-100 Z-drive azimuth thrusters which are fitted with fixed-pitch reversing propellers. In total the system creates and a maximum speed of . When minesweeping, the vessels have a maximum speed of . The &quot;Kingston&quot; class have a range of at and have an endurance of 18 days.

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class were initially armed with a single Bofors /60 calibre Mk 1N/1 anti-aircraft gun mounted in a Mk 5C Boffin mount and two single Browning M2 machine guns. The Bofors guns were refurbished World War II models that had been previously used by the Canadian Army for air defence in Europe. The Bofors gun was mounted on the forecastle deck until their removal in 2014. The machine guns are mounted on either side at the front of the bridge deck. The 40 mm guns were used as monuments after being dismounted. In October 2006, Maritime Command experimented with mounting a remote controlled heavy machine gun station, the OTO Melara 12.7 mm RCHMG, in place of the 40 mm Bofors cannon aboard . The Nanuk .50 calibre RCWS from Rheinmetall was trialled as a replacement aboard in 2018. All twelve ships have degaussing coil arrays fitted, but only the first three ships have the control system, with it situated between the two funnels.

===Modular payload===
On the aft sweep deck, there are three positions that can receive a variety of mission payloads in the form of ISO containers. The Royal Canadian Navy has a limited number of each mission payload;

* Two Indal Technologies AN/SLQ-38 deep mechanical minesweeping systems
* Four MDA Ltd. AN/SQS-511 heavyweight high-definition Route Survey System
* One ISE Ltd. Trailblazer bottom object inspection vehicle
* One ISE Ltd. HYSUB 50 deep seabed intervention system
* Fullerton and Sherwood Ltd. six-man, two-compartment containerised diving systems
* MDA Ltd. Interim Remote Minehunting and Disposal System control van

Furthermore, the vessels have additional systems not in an ISO container format that can be fitted, including;
* Two L3/Klein K 5500 high definition side scan sonars
* Four L3/Klein K 3000 dual frequency side scan sonars
* Two Deep Ocean Engineering Inc. Phantom 4 remotely operated vehicles (ROV)

The modules are split between the naval bases on each coast. The Trailblazer module is based at CFB Esquimalt, there are two route survey modules per coast, and the two minesweeping modules are located at CFB Halifax. In November 2009, the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle was successfully trialled aboard a &quot;Kingston&quot;-class vessel.

===Modernisation===
The Royal Canadian Navy discarded a $100-million mid-life refit plan for the twelve vessels in this class. It was intended to retain the &quot;mid-lifed&quot; vessels through 2045–2055. While the RCN concluded that the money would be better spent in acquiring a new platform, the Liberal Government&#x27;s 2017 defence policy statement, &quot;Strong, Secure and Engaged&quot;, did not reference replacing these vessels. The RCN review listed low speed and small size as reasons for the MCDV being inadequate for patrol duties (both are factors of the original specification). Notwithstanding the success of the ships in their deployment, critics suggest that patrol and training were tacked onto the mine-countermeasures role and that the platform lacks serious armament for a sovereignty enforcement role.

In October 2011, L-3 MAPPS was awarded a contract to supply degaussing systems for the &quot;Kingston&quot;-class ships. The advanced degaussing systems were to be delivered and supported locally in collaboration with SAM Electronics. In November 2012 MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates was awarded a two-year $13.4 million contract to repair and upgrade the deployable sonar systems.

In 2018 the Royal Canadian Navy acquired the UAV AeroVironment Puma II AE with Mantis i45 Sensor for use on the &quot;Kingston&quot; class.

==Construction and career==
In May 1992, a $650 million contract was awarded to Halifax Shipyards of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to construct twelve ships of the class. The vessels would be tasked with coastal patrol, minesweeping, law enforcement, pollution surveillance and search and rescue duties. Steel cutting for the first ship begin in December 1993, and by July 1999 all twelve &quot;Kingston&quot;-class ships were in service. 

The ships are evenly distributed between the east and west coasts. One vessel on each coast is maintained for rapid deployment: this responsibility is rotated amongst the ships. The &quot;Kingston&quot;-class ships deploy regularly as part of Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea and the Central American Pacific coast. The ships also deploy to the Arctic as part of Operation Nanook, and in naval exercises off the west coast of Africa and in the Baltic Sea among others. On 13 May 2010, it was announced that six of the twelve MCDVs would be placed in extended readiness due to lack of funds and the inability of the Naval Reserve to provide sufficient personnel to man the ships. However, on 14 May that order was rescinded.

<text>Eulalio Gutiérrez Ortiz (February 2, 1881 – August 12, 1939) was a general in the Mexican Revolution from state of Coahuila. He is most notable for his election as provisional president of Mexico during the Aguascalientes Convention and led the country for a few months between 6 November 1914 and 16 January 1915. The Convention was convened by revolutionaries who had successfully ousted the regime of Victoriano Huerta after more than a year of conflict. Gutiérrez rather than &quot;First Chief&quot; (&quot;Primer Jefe&quot;) Venustiano Carranza was chosen president of Mexico and a new round of violence broke out as revolutionary factions previously united turned against each other. &quot;The high point of Gutiérrez&#x27;s career occurred when he moved with the Conventionist army to shoulder the responsibilities of his new office [of president].&quot; Gutiérrez&#x27;s government was weak and he could not control the two main generals of the Army of the Convention, Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Gutiérrez moved the capital of his government from Mexico City to San Luis Potosí. He resigned as president and made peace with Carranza. He went into exile in the United States, but later returned to Mexico. He died in 1939, outliving many other major figures of the Mexican Revolution.

==Biography==
===Early life and political career===
He was born on the Hacienda de Santo Domingo, in the municipality of Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila. In his youth he was a shepherd and a miner in Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, where after some years he was named mayor of the municipality.

After joining Ricardo Flores Magón&#x27;s Mexican Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Mexicano&quot;) for a short period, he affiliated with the Anti-reelectionist Party (&quot;Partido Antirreleccionista&quot;) of Francisco I. Madero in 1909.

As with many revolutionaries, Gutiérrez was not a trained soldier, but combat in the Mexican Revolution showed his skill. He participated in the Mexican Revolution, after which he returned to his native state where he was elected mayor of Ramos Arizpe. After the coup d&#x27;état of Victoriano Huerta, he took up arms again and placed himself under the orders of Pablo González Garza in the Constitutionalist Army of Venustiano Carranza.

During the Aguascalientes Convention, he was named the provisional president of the Republic on November 1, 1914, and assumed the position two days later. His cabinet was composed of Lucio Blanco as Interior Minister; José Vasconcelos as Minister for Public Instruction and Fine Arts; Valentín Gama as Minister for Public Works; Felícitos Villarreal as Finance Minister; José Isabel Robles as Minister of War (&quot;Guerra y Marina&quot;); Manuel Palafox as Agriculture Minister; Manuel Chao as Mayor of the Distrito Federal; Mateo Almanza as Commander of the National Guard (&quot;Guarnición de México&quot;), and Pánfilo Natera as president of the Supreme Military Tribunal.
A month after he took office, revolutionary leaders Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata took Mexico City. Gutiérrez&#x27;s government was moved to the national capital, now in the hands of the Army of the Convention. Relations with Villa were strained to the point Villa had ordered the Minister of War (his superior), to execute President Gutiérrez in January 1915. In 1915, Gutiérrez told Vasconcelos that &quot;The Mexican landscape smells of blood.&quot; Gutiérrez decided to leave the capital on January 16, 1915, and moved his government to San Luis Potosí, where he declared both Villa and Carranza traitors to the &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; and formally resigned the presidency on July 2, 1915. Another source gives the date of his resignation as May 1915.

===Later years===
After exiling himself to the United States, he returned to Mexico in 1920 under the amnesty of Álvaro Obregón and was elected senator and governor of Coahuila in 1928. Later on, he publicly criticized the re-election of Álvaro Obregón in 1928 (assassinated before he could take office) and the Maximato of former president Plutarco Elías Calles (the period during which Calles was &quot;Jefe Máximo&quot;, &quot;Maximum Chief&quot;, and ruled via puppet presidents). He joined the rebellion of José Gonzalo Escobar.

After the defeat of that rebellion, he exiled himself to San Antonio, Texas, U.S., and did not return to Mexico until 1935. Four years later, he died in the city of Saltillo.

<doc id="1186548" wikidata="Q3115181" url="?curid=1186548" title="Islam in Cambodia">
<text>Islam is the religion of a majority of the Cham and Malay minorities in Cambodia. According to activist Po Dharma, there were 150,000 to 200,000 Muslims in Cambodia as late as 1975, although this may have been an exaggeration. Persecution under the Khmer Rouge eroded their numbers, however, and by the late 1980s they probably had not regained their former strength. In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that 1.6% of the population, or 236,000 people were Muslims. In 2021, the State Department estimated the Islamic population at less than 1%. Like other Muslim Cham people, those in Cambodia are Sunni Muslims of the Shafi&#x27;i denomination and following the Maturidi doctrine. Po Dharma divides the Muslim Cham in Cambodia into a traditionalist branch and an orthodox branch. (see Islam in Vietnam)

== Demography ==
In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that 1.6% of the population, or 236,000 people were Muslims. According to from general Population census results of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2019, there are around 311,045 Muslims in the country as of 2019. As of 2016, data from the Ministry also recorded 884 mosques scattered all throughout Cambodia. Tboung Khmum is a province where the percentage of Muslims is the largest among other provinces, namely 11.8%.

==Background of early Islam==
The Chams originated from the Kingdom of Champa. After Vietnam invaded and conquered Champa, Cambodia granted refuge to Cham Muslims escaping from Vietnamese conquest. According to some accounts, the Chams first contacted Islam in one of the fathers-in-law of Prophet Muhammad. He is Jahsh, the father of Zaynab bint Jahsh. It was in the wake of many Sahabas who arrived in Indo-China in 617-18 from Abyssinia by sea route. In 1642, King Ramathipadi I ascended the throne of Cambodia and converted to Islam, becoming the only Muslim ruler of Cambodia. After the massacre of Dutch VOC representatives and the expulsion of the VOC from Cambodia, popular discontentment from the majority Buddhist populace deposed him with the aid of the Nguyen lords in 1658, causing much instability in Cambodia in the years following his reign.

==Cham Muslims==

The Cham have their own mosques. In 1962, there were about 100 mosques in the country. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Muslims in Cambodia formed a unified community under the authority of four religious dignitaries — &quot;mupti&quot; (mufti), &quot;tuk kalih&quot;, &quot;raja kalik&quot;, and &quot;tvan pake&quot;. A council of notables in Cham villages consisted of one &quot;hakem&quot; (judge) and several &quot;katip&quot; (preacher), &quot;bilal&quot; (rinse), and &quot;labi&quot;. The four high dignitaries and the hakem were exempt from personal taxes, and they were invited to take part in major national ceremonies at the royal court. When Cambodia became independent, the Islamic community was placed under the control of a five-member council that represented the community in official functions and in contacts with other Islamic communities. Each Muslim community has a hakem who leads the community and the mosque, an imam who leads the prayers, and a &quot;bilal&quot; who calls the faithful to the daily prayers. The peninsula of Chrouy Changvar near Phnom Penh is considered the spiritual center of the Cham, and several high Muslim officials reside there. Each year some of the Cham go to study the Qur&#x27;an at Kelantan in Malaysia, and some go on to study in, or make a pilgrimage to, Mecca. According to figures from the late 1950s, about 7 percent of the Cham had completed the pilgrimage and could wear the fez or turban as a sign of their accomplishment.

The traditional Cham retain many ancient Muslim or pre-Muslim traditions and rites. They consider Allah as the all-powerful God, but they also recognize other non-Islamic practices. They are closer, in many respects, to the Cham of coastal Vietnam than they are to other Muslims. The religious dignitaries of the traditional Cham (and of the Cham in Vietnam) dress completely in white, and they shave their heads and faces. These Cham believe in the power of magic and sorcery, and they attach great importance to magical practices in order to avoid sickness or slow or violent death. They believe in many supernatural powers. Although they show little interest in the pilgrimage to Mecca and in the five daily prayers, the traditional Cham do celebrate many Muslim festivals and rituals.

The orthodox Cham have adopted a more conformist religion largely because of their close contacts with, and intermarriages with, the Malay community. In fact, the orthodox Cham have adopted Malay customs and family organization, and many speak the Malay language. They send pilgrims to Mecca, and they attend international Islamic conferences. Conflicts between the traditional and the orthodox Cham increased between 1954 and 1975. For example, the two groups polarized the population of one village, and each group eventually had its own mosque and separate religious organization.

==Chvea Muslims== 
The Chvea (literally &quot;Java&quot;) arrived in Cambodia in the 14th century from the Malay Peninsula and Indonesian Archipelago, and traditionally occupied the coastal part of the country. Some scholars argue that intermarriage between these groups has served to form a separate Muslim community, while other scholars identify them as the Cham people.

==Khmer Muslims==
Khmer is the largest ethnicity in Cambodia which the majority follows to Theravada Buddhism. There are also Khmer Muslim converts from Buddhism and these can be found in Kwan village, Kampong Speu. Where Islam was spread by Abdul Amit a Cham farmer to the villagers of Kwan.

==Persecution==

Persecution of the Cham in Cambodia took place mainly during the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. The Khmer Rouge gained had control over the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) after defeating the Khmer Republic forces in 1975. Under its leader Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge – formally known as the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) – set to redefine the policies of the Democratic Kampuchea through its agrarian and inward-looking economic-political outlook. This resulted in the massive relocation of the masses from urban areas to the countryside where they were forced to work in the fields every day with little food and rest. On top of that, the Khmer Rouge regime began to systematically dismantle the socioeconomic structures of the people and screen them based on their political, religious, and ethnic backgrounds in order to maintain socio-political order based on Pol Pot’s communist ideals. Buddhism, which was then the dominant faith group in Cambodian society, was repressed; the monks were made to be defrocked and sent to work in the fields. Scholars and historians have differed in the definite number of victims, but have estimated that nearly one-third of the Cambodian population than were estimated to have been killed by the regime or died out of starvation and disease - bringing the total number to be between the ranges of 1.05 million to 2.2 million lives. The Cham were also not spared from persecution, torture, and death under the hands of the regime.

David Chandler opined that, although ethnic minorities fell victim to the Khmer Rouge regime, they were not targeted specifically because of their ethnic backgrounds, but rather because they were mostly enemies of the revolution (Kiernan, 2002:252; see also the footnote on Chandler’s &quot;The Tragedy of Cambodian History&quot;, pp. 4, 263–65, 285). Furthermore, Chandler also rejects the use of the terms “chauvinism” and “genocide” just to avoid drawing possible parallels to Hitler. This indicates that Chandler does not believe in the argument of charging the Khmer Rouge regime with the crime of genocide. Similarly, Michael Vickery holds a similar position to Chandler’s, and refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime as genocide; Vickery regarded the Khmer Rouge a “chauvinist” regime, due to its anti-Vietnam and anti-religion policies (Kiernan, 2002:252; see Vickery’s &quot;Cambodia 1975-1982&quot;, pp. 181–82, 255, 258, 264–65). Stephen Heder also conceded that the Khmer Rouge were not guilty of genocide, stating that the atrocities of the regime were not motivated by race (Kiernan, 2002:252; see Heder’s &quot;From Pol Pot to Pen Sovan to the Villages&quot;, p. 1).

Ben Kiernan makes the argument that it was indeed genocide and disagrees with the three scholars, by bringing forth examples from the history of the Cham people in Cambodia, as did an international tribunal finding Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan guilty 92 and 87 counts of said crime respectively According to Ben Kiernan, the racialization of the Cham during the colonial and post-colonial eras could be the main reason behind the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s hatred of the Cham people. Misinformation and racial stereotypes were used to disconnect the Cham from their ancestral homelands, including the Cham extinction theory that was proposed by colonial scholars, according to that theory, the &quot;real&quot; Cham were extinct. Kiernan writes: &quot;In the twentieth century, Chams have suffered from two myths: the glory of their &quot;empire&quot; has been exaggerated, and so has their present plight. A romanticized view of Cham doom helped deprive them of rights in 1975–79. They were called &quot;Malays&quot; by the French, and after Cambodia&#x27;s independence, received a new, equally inaccurate label: &quot;Islamic Khmers.&quot; Again their ethnic origin was denied, in the perverse sense, Chams became victims of History.&quot; Scholars also compare the denial of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s racist motivation for its genocide against the Cham to the denial of the Holocaust, both forms of genocide denial are analogous narrational canards that seek to use victims&#x27; religions to justify the actions of genocide perpetrators but they ignore wider race and ethnic hatreds and discriminatory backgrounds

==Today==
Islam is an officially recognised religion in the country, and Muslims practice their religion normally and out in the open. The term Khmer Muslims as a whole is considered discrimination against minorities, especially the Cham. This commenced in the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea era, where religions were restored and allowed to be practiced again. The Chams also enjoy democratic rights like all Khmer citizens, with the right to vote and be elected as politicians. The government also sponsors annual &quot;iftar&quot; gatherings during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan. In 2018, the leader of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) called Cambodia a &quot;beacon for Muslim coexistence&quot;.

In 2016, amateur football club was founded by the Cambodian Youth Muslim Alliance, namely CMYA FC, which is to accommodate Muslim youth, especially in the field of sports.

<text>William Young VC (1 January 1876 – 27 August 1916) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 39 years old, and a private in the 8th (S) Battalion, The East Lancashire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 December 1915, east of Foncquevillers, France, Private Young saw from his trench that one of his company&#x27;s NCOs was lying wounded in front of the wire. Acting without orders and heedless of his exposure to enemy fire, he climbed over the parapet and went to the rescue of his sergeant. He was hit by two bullets, one shattered his jaw and the other entered his chest. Undeterred, he went on and, with another soldier who came to assist, brought the wounded sergeant back to safety. Later Private Young walked back to the village dressing station to have his injuries attended to. He spent the next four months in the hospital, but died in August 1916 when undergoing surgery.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Lancashire at War exhibition at The Museum of Lancashire in Preston, Lancashire, England.

<doc id="1186563" wikidata="Q17143966" url="?curid=1186563" title="Petition to make special">
<text>In United States patent law, a petition to make special (PTMS) is a formal request submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) asking that a patent application be examined ahead of the other pending applications in the same technological art.

== Background and rationale ==

Normally patent applications in a given technological art are examined in the order that they are filed in under the &quot;first come, first served&quot; principle. The patent office has realized, however, that some inventions deserve special attention and that patent applications covering these inventions should be examined as quickly as possible. If an invention falls into one of the special categories, the applicant (e.g. inventor) can petition to have it examined early.

A petition to make special can be granted because:

* one of the inventors is over the age of 65 or is ill to the point where they may not be available to assist in the prosecution of the patent,
* the head of a government agency requests that the application be made special,
* the patent relates to certain areas including: quality of the environment, development of energy resources, or terrorism,
* the applicant wishes to take part in accelerated examination as described below, or
* the applicant has received a positive indication of allowability in another jurisdiction and is participating in the Patent Prosecution Highway.

== Accelerated examination ==

Effective in August 2006, the USPTO introduced an accelerated patent examination procedure in an effort to allow inventors a speedy evaluation of an application with a final disposition within 12 months. The procedure requires additional information to be submitted with the application and also includes an interview with the examiner. The first accelerated patent was granted on March 15, 2007, with a 6-month issuance time.

== Petitions to make special and business methods==

Petitions to make special are particularly important for timely examination of business method patents. Projected delays in examination of business method patents range from 4 to 14 years. This is primarily due to the step change in business method filings after the 1998 &quot;State Street Bank decision&quot; combined with the difficulty in hiring and training qualified patent examiners in the financial services arts (e.g. insurance and banking).

It is reported that a PTMS for Accelerated Examination can cut the time to get a patent to issue in the business method area from more than five years to less than two. First office actions can issue in as little as six months from the filing date of the application and notices of allowable subject matter have issued in just over a year.

<text>Sergeant Thomas Young (born as Thomas Morrell) VC (28 January 1895 − 15 October 1966) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Thomas was from High Spen in what is now the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. He was 23 years old, and a private in the 9th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the period 25/31 March 1918 at Bucquoy, France, Private Young, a stretcher-bearer, worked unceasingly evacuating the wounded from seemingly impossible places. On nine occasions he went out in front of British lines in broad daylight, under heavy rifle, machine-gun and shell fire and brought back wounded to safety. Those too badly wounded to be moved before dressing, he dressed under fire and then carried them back unaided. He saved nine lives in this manner.

A memorial to Thomas Young and Frederick William Dobson another VC recipient from High Spen was unveiled in July 2007 and can be seen in the grounds of High Spen primary school.

==Legacy==
His VC was displayed at the Durham Light Infantry Museum &amp; Durham Art Gallery in Durham City.

Statues by the sculptor, Roger Andrews, depicting Young and Lieutenant Richard Annand VC, who served with the Durham Light Infantry in the Second World War, were unveiled inside South Shields Town Hall in May 2007.

<text>Captain Thomas James Young, VC (1827 – 20 March 1869) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was approximately 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, serving with a Naval Brigade from during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 November 1857 at Lucknow, British India, naval guns were brought up close to the Shah Nujeff mosque, and the gun crews kept up a steady fire in an attempt to breach the walls, while a hail of musket balls and grenades from the mutineers inside the mosque caused heavy casualties. Lieutenant Young moved from gun to gun giving encouragement, and when he and Able Seaman William Hall were the only survivors, all the rest being killed or wounded, Lieutenant Young took the last gunner&#x27;s place and between them they loaded and fired the gun. The joint citation reads:
He later achieved the rank of captain. He married Louisa Mary Boyes, the sister of Duncan Gordon Boyes, who also won the Victoria Cross.

Young died in Caen, France, and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery there. 

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London.

== Viticulture ==
Te Kauwhata lies at the centre of one of New Zealand&#x27;s smaller wine-producing regions, which stretches from Pukekohe, just south of Auckland, across to Thames and Paeroa at the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula. The region is particularly notable for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc wines.

A government research station was set up in 1886 to explore different crop options. Romeo Bragato took over the running of this station in 1901, with the first wine produced there in 1903. The research station was in private hands, as part of Rongopai wines, and has been subsequently bought out by Babich Wines, but the original buildings are still in use as a cellar door. In February 2016, Invivo Wines, producer of Graham Norton&#x27;s Own Sauvignon Blanc, announced it had secured a 10-year lease of this winery.

<text>John Francis Young (14 January 1893 – 7 November 1929) was a Canadian soldier who served in the First World War. Young was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Young was one of the seven Canadians who were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Metcalf, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck and Walter Leigh Rayfield.

==Early life==
John Francis Young was born in Kidderminster, England on 14 January 1893. He was the son of Robert Charles Young and Mary Ann Cooper. He had two brothers: Robert Peart Young born in 1896 and Reginald H. Young born 1903. He emigrated to Canada before World War I and worked in Montreal as a packer for Imperial Tobacco.

==Victoria Cross==
John Francis Young was 25 years old, and a private in the 87th (Canadian Grenadier Guards) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 2 September 1918 in the Dury-Arras Sector, France, when his company had suffered heavy casualties, Private Young, a stretcher-bearer, went forward to dress the wounded in open ground swept by machine-gun and rifle fire. He did this for over an hour displaying absolute fearlessness, and on more than one occasion, having used up all his stock of dressings, he made his way to company headquarters for a further supply before returning to the battlefield. Later in the day he organised and led stretcher-bearers to bring in the wounded whom he had dressed. He spent a full hour rescuing well over a dozen men.

Mustard gas was present in the battle which damaged one of Young&#x27;s lungs. This later contributed to his contracting tuberculosis.

The citation reads:

He received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 30 April 1919.


==Later life==
After the war, Young continued to serve in the Regiment, rising to the rank of Sergeant. He subsequently returned to his old job in Montreal. Some years later he developed tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Quebec, where he died on 7 November 1929. He was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal. His grave, marked with a somewhat weather-worn headstone, is in Section L/2, plot 2019.

==Legacy==
The Canadian Grenadier Guards&#x27; Junior Ranks mess has been renamed the &quot;John Francis Young Club&quot; in his honour and still bears his name. In Young&#x27;s honour, members are required to execute a proper halt, briefly coming to attention, upon entering the club. There is a memorial plaque to him in the Sergeants&#x27; mess. He is remembered still and honoured as one of the outstanding heroes of the Regiment&#x27;s history.

==The Medal==
His VC is held by the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.

<doc id="1186581" wikidata="Q54979" url="?curid=1186581" title="Teddy Bear (1981 film)">
<text>Teddy Bear is the English title of Miś , a 1981 Polish comedy film directed by Stanisław Bareja. &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, along with &quot;The Cruise&quot; &quot;(Rejs)&quot;, was a reflection of contemporary Polish society using surreal humor to somehow get past the censorship at the time. It gained cult status in its native country. Later, the film was reappraised by critics and it has been regarded as one of the best Polish films ever made.

==Plot==

Rysiek (Stanisław Tym, who also co-wrote the screenplay), the shrewd manager of a state-sponsored sports club, has to travel to London before his ex-wife Irena (Barbara Burska) gets there to collect a large sum of money from their joint savings account.
However, getting out of a communist country is never easy, even for a well-connected operator like Rysiek. After his wife destroys Rysiek&#x27;s hard to get passport he is stranded in Warsaw while she&#x27;s off to London. The circumstances force him to plot a Byzantine scheme with support of his equally cunning friend. Their plan involves a movie production as well as tracking down a look-alike (also played by Tym) to &quot;borrow&quot; their passport.

Hilarity ensues as Bareja gives the audience a guided tour of the corruption, absurd bureaucracy, pervasive bribery and flourishing black market that pervaded socialism in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

The titular (teddy) bear is a nickname given to the main character, but also a big straw-bear used in a corruption scheme. Perhaps playing on the well-established Russian Bear trope, Misha is the mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, the same year as the film.

<text>Shelagh Rogers, OC, is a Canadian broadcast journalist based in British Columbia. She is the current chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston. She is also the host and producer of CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;The Next Chapter&quot;, and the former chancellor of the University of Victoria.

== Background ==

Rogers grew up in Ottawa, Ontario. Rogers began in broadcasting at CFRC, the campus radio station of Queen&#x27;s University. She also worked at Kingston, Ontario&#x27;s CKWS, hosting a country music program while still a student at Queen&#x27;s. She later went on to produce a daily current affairs TV show and served as the station&#x27;s late-night weather presenter.

Rogers graduated from Queen&#x27;s University&#x27;s arts program (B.A., art history) in 1977.

Rogers is a member of the Métis Nation of Greater Victoria, a chartered community of the Métis Nation British Columbia.

==CBC Radio==
In 1980, she joined CBC Radio in Ottawa, hosting local current affairs programs and jazz and classical music broadcasts. In 1982, she became host of the national classical concert program &quot;Mostly Music&quot;.

In 1984, she moved to CBC Toronto. In addition to hosting local programs, she became a frequent contributor to many national shows, including &quot;Morningside,&quot; &quot;The Max Ferguson Show&quot; and &quot;Basic Black&quot;. She was also the founding host of &quot;The Arts Tonight&quot;.

She became a frequent guest host of &quot;Morningside&quot;, and in 1995 the program&#x27;s host, Peter Gzowski, named Rogers the show&#x27;s permanent guest host.

In 1997, Rogers moved to CBC Radio Two as host of &quot;Take Five&quot;. During this time, Rogers was also a contributor to TVOntario&#x27;s book program, &quot;Imprint&quot;, and host of &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;.

In 2000, Rogers returned to Radio One as host of &quot;This Morning&quot;, which she hosted for two years. In 2002, she became host of &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;.

Rogers left &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot; at the end of May 2008. She is now the host and a producer of &quot;The Next Chapter&quot;, an award-winning weekly show about writers and writing in Canada. On May 13, 2023, she announced that her final episode as host of &quot;The Next Chapter&quot; will air on June 24, 2023.

In June 2011, she was inducted as an honorary witness for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.

Also in 2011, she was named an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for her contributions as a promoter of Canadian culture, and for her volunteer work in the fields of mental health and literacy.&quot; Her Order of Canada citation reads: &quot;Shelagh Rogers is a passionate journalist, activist and promoter of all things Canadian. A nationally renowned radio broadcaster, she is best known for hosting the CBC’s “This Morning” and “Sounds Like Canada.” Also highly regarded for her advocacy work, she has spoken out to help destigmatize mental illness, and has raised awareness and funds for adult literacy initiatives. She now champions reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people as an honorary witness to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.&quot;

Rogers is the co-editor of &quot;Speaking My Truth: Reflections on Reconciliation and Residential School&quot; (2012), &quot;Reconciliation and the Way Forward&quot; (2014) and &quot;Speaking My Truth: A Journey to Reconciliation&quot; (2018).

In May 2023, Rogers announced her retirement from CBC Radio, effective June 24.

<text>The Mathematische Arbeitstagung taking place annually in Bonn since 1957, and founded by Friedrich Hirzebruch, was an international meeting of mathematicians intended to act in clearing-house fashion, by disseminating current research ideas; and, at the same time, to bring mathematics in West Germany back into its place in European trends. It proved highly successful in attracting the cream of younger mathematicians, partly because its structure was not that of the conventional international conference. The programme of talks was decided &#x27;in real time&#x27; only, rather than in advance.

For example, in 1962 the meeting was dominated by talks on K-theory, at that time the breaking news. The early participants included Jean-Pierre Serre, Jacques Tits, Alexander Grothendieck, Hans Grauert, Nicolaas Kuiper, Raoul Bott, John Milnor, Stephen Smale, Armand Borel, Shiing-Shen Chern, Kunihiko Kodaira, Donald Spencer, Michael Atiyah, Isadore Singer, Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar, Michel Kervaire, Marcel Berger, Karl Stein, Reinhold Remmert, René Thom, Serge Lang and Frank Adams.

The institutional structure was reinforced from 1969 by the &quot;Sonderforschungsbereich Theoretische Mathematik&quot; programme, and from 1980 by the founding of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.

<doc id="1186596" wikidata="Q7402053" url="?curid=1186596" title="Saint Paul Sunday">
<text>Saint Paul Sunday is a Peabody Award-winning weekly classical music radio program that aired from 1980 to 2007, with encore broadcasts airing through 2012. It was hosted by Bill McGlaughlin for its entire run. At its height, it was America&#x27;s most widely listened to weekly classical music program produced by public radio, and aired on approximately 200 stations nationwide. Programs since 1997 are also available as archived audio on the Internet. The hour-long show featured live, in-studio performances by and interviews with the world&#x27;s top classical musicians, both soloists and ensembles.

For each hour-long show, McGlaughlin invited a virtuoso soloist or ensemble into the studio to discuss and perform music. The music on the program generally fit under the wide umbrella of classical music, and the pieces performed ran the gamut from late medieval through to contemporary music.

&quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; was distributed by American Public Media, and produced in the St. Paul, Minnesota studios of Minnesota Public Radio, American Public Media&#x27;s main subsidiary.

==Format==

===Premise===

According to the &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; website, the show&#x27;s premise was, &quot;What would it be like to hear the Juilliard String Quartet perform in your living room? Or to invite violinist Joshua Bell over for brunch and Bach?&quot; Host Bill McGlaughlin opened the studio to the world&#x27;s best classical musicians, of every conceivable style and mix, for both discussion and performance — giving listeners intimate access to how excellent music was created. McGlaughlin engaged each soloist or ensemble in spontaneous live questioning and conversation, so that insights, anecdotes, and commentary alternated with live performances by the guest musicians.

One of the show&#x27;s intentions was to disprove the misconception that chamber music is open only to connoisseurs. McGlaughlin aims to dispel this view, and to make the music fresh, lively, and fun.

===Outreach===

To keep the music and performances contemporary and relevant to today&#x27;s audiences, &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; expanded the definition of chamber music. The show included a diverse and eclectic mix of performers and music from around the world — music and musicians which have included Brazilian &quot;choro&quot; music from the Robison-Lubambo-Baptista Trio, American gospel group the Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers, Latin-American and African carols and folk dances from Andrew Lawrence-King and The Harp Consort, the viol quartet Phantasm, jazz trumpeter Art Farmer, Bolivian Andean music specialists Rumillajta, eclectic composer Mark O&#x27;Connor and the Appalachia Waltz Trio, and African-American Latino wind group Imani Winds.

&quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; often hosted performances of recent music by living composers — composers which have included Thomas Adès, George Tsontakis, Osvaldo Golijov, Fred Lerdahl, Derek Bermel, Frederic Rzewski, and dozens of others. In addition, &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; has itself commissioned new works from composers such as Pierre Jalbert, Aaron Jay Kernis, Nicholas Maw (in partnership with PRI), Kenneth Frazelle, Gabriela Lena Frank, and Edgar Meyer, among others.

For physical outreach, from time to time McGlaughlin and &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; have traveled to do on-site programs with notable classical musical ensembles at various venues around the U.S. These concerts have generated much excitement from local audiences. To further make classical music more accessible to more people, &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; has also done residencies at primary and secondary schools in the Midwest — which include recording sessions, performances, and question-and-answer sessions with McGlaughlin, the musicians, and the students.

==Inception and history==

During the late 1970s, Pennsylvania native Bill McGlaughlin, a trombonist and conductor, was engaged as Associate Conductor of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. Before conducting a performance he often spoke to the audience, informally explaining the program and what to listen for. Garrison Keillor heard him, and invited McGlaughlin to fill in occasionally as host of his daily morning radio show on Minnesota Public Radio (MPR).

Around this same time, National Public Radio gained access to a communications satellite, which meant that production was no longer limited to New York, Los Angeles, or Washington, D.C. Cities with uplinks, like St. Paul, could finally produce their own national shows. Consequently, in 1979 the Mellon Foundation provided MPR with seed money to make several pilot programs.

In early 1980, via local benefactors, Minnesota Public Radio also built a new studio — the Maud Moon Weyerhaeuser Studio (&quot;Studio M&quot;) — a beautiful space with 20-foot windows overlooking St. Paul&#x27;s cathedral district. This inspired producer Tom Voegeli, then working in national programming for MPR, to create a new show that would play to the studio&#x27;s strengths. Voegeli came up with the idea for &quot;Saint Paul Sunday Morning&quot;, with McGlaughlin as host — a distinctive, intimate program which would present world-class musicians, live, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin to sound like a musician rather than like a broadcaster, and to share his own spontaneous, animated enthusiasm with listeners.

The show debuted on MPR in 1980, and was picked up nationally in 1981, eventually shortening its name to &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; to allow stations to broadcast it at any time of the day on Sunday. The series&#x27; unique approach and sense of exuberance and curiosity won it hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic listeners, and the 1995 Peabody Award.

==Notable guests==

&quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; played host to hundreds of musicians of international repute. These have included many singers, both ensemble and solo; many quartets and trios and various other sizes and combinations of chamber groups; many pianists and other soloists; small orchestras and choruses; and traditional and non-traditional musical groups from around the world.

A small sampling of guests includes such artists as:
*Gil Shaham
*Chanticleer
*Anonymous 4
*Garrick Ohlsson
*Guarneri Quartet
*eighth blackbird
*Joshua Bell

*Anne-Sophie Mutter
==Impact and reception==

In 1995 the Peabody Award, the highest honor in broadcasting, was awarded to &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot;. The foundation stated:

:For 15 years Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; has provided listeners with extraordinary access to the world&#x27;s finest classical musicians. The luminaries presented by Bill McGlaughlin, host since the show&#x27;s inception, ... [are numerous]. &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; presents emerging new talent as well as commissioned classical works, including those by new composers Aaron Jay Kernis, Kenneth Frazelle, and Edgar Meyer. Through the program&#x27;s music and discussion format, listeners get to know the people behind the music and gain insight into the creative process. For an excellent series showcasing classical music, a Peabody to Minnesota Public Radio for &quot;Saint Paul Sunday.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reports that:

:&quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; has a history of [listener] loyalty ... Ask these people what inspires their devotion, and the answers are all variations on one theme: The show achieves an inside look at world-class music-making that is intimate, welcoming, and ultimately addictive.

==Listening==

&quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; aired on approximately 200 public and commercial radio stations in the U.S. Past, current, and future shows can also be listened to on the show&#x27;s website. Current shows can also be listened to at various times of day on 31 online radio stations. The show also airs in New Zealand on Radio New Zealand Concert, and on XM Satellite Radio Channel 133 Mondays at 4:00 AM Eastern Time. Online program notes, playlists, and artist profiles for each show — past, present, and future — are provided on the &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot; website.

<doc id="1186607" wikidata="Q3366746" url="?curid=1186607" title="Socialist Workers Party (Algeria)">
<text>The Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, PST; ; ) is an Algerian political party. Founded in 1989 by the Revolutionary Communist Group, itself established by a group of Trotskyist students in 1974, the PST remains affiliated with Fourth International, a Trotskyist international.

In the 2007 Algerian parliamentary election, the PST won 0.75% of the vote, meaning it did not receive any of the 389 seats available.

==History==
In 2019, the PST joined the Forces of the Democratic Alternative (FDA), a secular alliance of political and civil opposition during the pro-democracy Hirak movement. As part of the FDA, it boycotted the 2021 Algerian parliamentary elections, which subsequently had the lowest turnout of an Algerian election, at 22.99%.

In January 2022, the Council of State order the freezing of all PST activities, as well as the closure of its headquarters, following a complaint filed by the Ministry of the Interior. THE PST denounced this as &quot;a blatant attack on partisan pluralism and democratic freedoms in Algeria&quot;.

<doc id="1186614" wikidata="Q450400" url="?curid=1186614" title="Eric Woolfson">
<text>Eric Norman Woolfson (18 March 1945 – 2 December 2009) was a Scottish songwriter, lyricist, vocalist, executive producer, pianist, and co-creator of the band the Alan Parsons Project, who sold over 50 million albums worldwide. Woolfson also pursued a career in musical theatre.

== Early life ==
Woolfson was born into a Jewish family in the Charing Cross area of Glasgow, where his family owned the Elders furniture store. He was raised in the Pollokshields area on the south side of the city and educated at the High School of Glasgow. Woolfson&#x27;s interest in music was inspired by an uncle and he taught himself to play the piano. After leaving school, he briefly flirted with becoming an accountant before moving to London to seek opportunities in the music industry.

==Early career==
Arriving in London in 1963, he found work as a session pianist. The then current record producer for the Rolling Stones, Andrew Loog Oldham, signed him as a songwriter. During the following years, Woolfson wrote songs for artists such as Marianne Faithfull, Frank Ifield, Joe Dassin, the Tremeloes, Marie (French singer), Marmalade, Dave Berry, Peter Noone, and the Poets. In due course Woolfson signed other publishing deals as more of his songs were adopted by leading recording artists, throughout Europe and America. He also signed a deal with Southern Music, where he worked alongside composers and lyricists such as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.

In 1971, with the assistance of Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, Lol Creme and Graham Gouldman (who later became 10cc), a single was produced under the name of Eric Elder (&quot;San Tokay&quot; b/w &quot;Sunflower&quot;) and issued on UK Philips 6006 081 and US Philips 40699. Woolfson then produced a single by Graham Gouldman (&quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; b/w &quot;Growing Older&quot;) which was issued in 1972 on UK CBS 7739. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Woolfson was an independent record producer for several record companies, and worked with artists including Dave Berry, the Equals, the Tremeloes and, in 1973, Darren Burn. Despite his success, he found that earning a living as a songwriter was not easy and decided to try artist management.

His move into management was instantly successful. His first two signings were Carl Douglas (whose record &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; (1974) was one of the biggest selling hits of all time) and engineer/record producer Alan Parsons.

==The Alan Parsons Project==
In 1974, Woolfson met record producer Alan Parsons at the Abbey Road Studios in London where both were working on different projects. Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager and they worked together with a number of bands and artists including Pilot, Cockney Rebel, John Miles, Al Stewart, Ambrosia and the Hollies.

Subsequently, Woolfson and Parsons formed the Alan Parsons Project, the name originally being intended as a working title for their collaborative project. From 1976 to 1987, Woolfson and Parsons collaborated on the conception and lyrics for all ten albums by the Alan Parsons Project, which have achieved worldwide album sales in excess of 50 million.

On every Project album, Woolfson would sing a guide vocal track for each song, which the album&#x27;s eventual lead vocalists would use as a reference. Some of these tracks can be heard on the new remastered editions of various Project albums released in 2007. Woolfson himself was the actual singer on many of the Project&#x27;s biggest hits such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot;, &quot;Prime Time&quot; and the band&#x27;s signature tune &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 16–30 October 1982.

== Solo career ==
&quot;Freudiana&quot; was originally meant to be the 11th album by the Alan Parsons Project, but Woolfson was keen to explore the possibility of realising the project as a musical. While recording the album, Brian Brolly was introduced to Woolfson and promised to steer the album in this new direction. Brolly was previously a partner with Andrew Lloyd Webber, and together they created such musicals as &quot;Cats&quot;. With some help from Brolly, Woolfson was able to turn &quot;Freudiana&quot; into a stage musical.

Before the &quot;Freudiana&quot; stage production opened in 1990 in Vienna, a double-length studio album was released. The musical had a successful run, and it was planned that the show would open in other cities. However, plans were put on hold when a lawsuit broke out between Brolly and Woolfson, each fighting for control of the project. The studio disc (the &quot;white&quot; album) was quite difficult to obtain for a while. There was also a double-length German-language cast disc (the &quot;black&quot; album) which is currently out of print.

== Musical theatre ==
Woolfson explained his career switch during an interview in 2004: 

His first three musicals were &quot;Freudiana&quot; (1990), about Sigmund Freud; &quot;Gaudi&quot; (1993), about Antonio Gaudi, and &quot;Gambler&quot; (1996). A fourth musical &quot;Edgar Allan POE&quot;, based on the life of the author, was given a world premiere concert production at Abbey Road studios, London in 2003. An album was released in 2003 as &quot;&quot; (this contains some but not all of the songs from the stage version), and a musical album CD &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (containing the complete musical score of 17 songs) and a DVD of the POE Abbey Road concert were released in 2009.

&quot;Dancing with Shadows&quot; (inspired by the anti-war play &quot;Forest Fire&quot; by the Korean playwright Cham Bum-Suk and with a book by Ariel Dorfman) was premiered in July 2007 in Korea.

==Personal life==
Woolfson married his wife Hazel in 1969 and they had two daughters and four grandchildren. Politically, he was a centrist, supporting the Social Democratic Party (SDP) throughout the 1980s. A friend of the SDP&#x27;s second leader, David Owen, Woolfson refused to back the party&#x27;s merger with the Liberal Party in 1988 and instead followed Owen into the &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP, of which he was a trustee (alongside David Sainsbury and Sir Leslie Murphy) until it was dissolved in 1990.

==Death==
Woolfson died from kidney cancer in London on 2 December 2009. He was survived by his wife, daughters Sally Seddon and Lorna Covington and four grandchildren. He is buried in Cathcart Cemetery near Glasgow.

<doc id="1186616" wikidata="Q186341" url="?curid=1186616" title="The Shining (film)">
<text>The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. It is based on Stephen King&#x27;s novel of the same name and stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers. The film presents the descent into insanity of a recovering alcoholic and aspiring novelist (Nicholson) who takes a job as winter caretaker for a haunted mountain resort hotel with his wife (Duvall) and clairvoyant son (Lloyd).

Production took place almost exclusively in England at EMI Elstree Studios, with sets based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel.

The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October 2 by Warner Bros. There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the preceding cut; about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. The film received two controversial nominations at the first Razzies in 1981—Worst Director and Worst Actress—the latter of which was later rescinded in 2022 due to Kubrick&#x27;s alleged treatment of Duvall on set. Critical response to the film has since become favorable.

Frequently cited as one of the best horror films of all time, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; in 2018. A sequel titled &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; based on King&#x27;s 2013 novel of the same name was adapted to film and released in 2019.

== Plot ==

Jack Torrance takes a winter caretaker position at the remote Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, which closes every winter season. After his arrival, manager Stuart Ullman informs Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, killed his wife, two young daughters and himself in the hotel a decade prior.

In Boulder, Jack&#x27;s son, Danny, has a and seizure. Jack&#x27;s wife, Wendy, tells the doctor about a past incident when Jack accidentally dislocated Danny&#x27;s shoulder during a drunken rage. Jack has been sober ever since. Before leaving for the seasonal break, the Overlook&#x27;s head chef, Dick Hallorann, informs Danny of a telepathic ability the two share, which he calls &quot;shining&quot;. Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel also has a &quot;shine&quot; due to residue from unpleasant past events and warns him to avoid Room 237.

A month passes and Danny starts having frightening visions, including of the murdered Grady twins. Meanwhile, Jack&#x27;s mental health deteriorates; he suffers from writer&#x27;s block, is prone to violent outbursts, and has dreams of killing his family. Danny gets lured to room 237 by unseen forces, and Wendy later finds him with signs of physical trauma for which she blames Jack. Jack sulks in the ballroom, where ghostly bartender Lloyd entices him back to drinking. Wendy tells him that Danny was attacked by a &quot;crazy woman&quot; in room 237. Jack investigates and encounters a hideous female ghost in the bathroom but tells Wendy he saw nothing. He blames Danny for inflicting the bruises on himself and reacts angrily when Wendy suggests leaving the hotel. Danny enters a trance and telepathically contacts Hallorann. Returning to the ballroom, Jack finds it filled with ghostly figures including waiter Delbert Grady, who urges Jack to &quot;correct&quot; his wife and child.

Wendy finds Jack&#x27;s manuscript written with nothing but countless repetitions of the proverb “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”. When Jack threatens her life, Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny cannot leave because Jack previously sabotaged the hotel&#x27;s two-way radio and snowcat. Back in their hotel room, Danny says “redrum” repeatedly and writes the word in lipstick on the bathroom door. Wendy sees the word in the mirror and realizes that it is actually “murder” spelled backward.

Jack is freed by Grady and goes after Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny escapes outside through the bathroom window, and Wendy fights Jack off with a knife when he tries to break through the door. Hallorann, having flown back to Colorado from his Florida vacation, reaches the hotel in another snowcat. His arrival distracts Jack, who ambushes and murders him in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering the hotel&#x27;s ghosts and a vision of cascading blood from an elevator similar to Danny&#x27;s premonition.

In the hedge maze, Danny carefully backtracks to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift. Jack plunges onward without a trail and becomes lost. Danny and Wendy reunite and leave in Hallorann&#x27;s snowcat, leaving Jack to freeze to death in the maze.

In a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amidst a crowd of party revelers from July 4, 1921.

== Cast ==
In the European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton were removed but the credits remained unchanged. Dennen is on-screen in all versions of the film, albeit to a limited degree (and with no dialogue) in the European cut.

The actresses who played the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are identical twins. The characters in the book and film script are sisters, not twins. In the film&#x27;s dialogue, Ullman says that he thinks that they were &quot;about eight and ten&quot;. Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as &quot;the Grady twins&quot;.

The resemblance in the staging of the Grady girls and the &quot;Twins&quot; photograph by Diane Arbus has been noted by Arbus&#x27; biographer, Patricia Bosworth, the Kubrick assistant who cast and coached them, Leon Vitali, and by numerous Kubrick critics. Although Kubrick both met Arbus personally and studied photography under her during his time as photographer for &quot;Look&quot; magazine, Kubrick&#x27;s widow says he did not deliberately model the Grady girls on Arbus&#x27; photograph, in spite of widespread attention to the resemblance.

== Analysis ==

=== Social interpretations ===
Film critic Jonathan Romney writes that the film has been interpreted in many ways, including addressing the topics of the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism. &quot;It&#x27;s tempting to read &quot;The Shining&quot; as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack&#x27;s culture of the written word and Danny&#x27;s culture of images&quot;, Romney writes, &quot;Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his &#x27;contract&#x27; with the Overlook. &#x27;I gave my word&#x27;, ... which we take to mean &#x27;gave his soul&#x27; in the ... Faustian sense. But maybe he means it more literally – by the end ... he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation ... over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy that he seems to have neglected to sign with his family.&quot;

==== Native Americans ====
Among interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the early viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore titled &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s &#x27;Shining&#x27; Secret: Film&#x27;s Hidden Horror Is The Murder of the Indian&quot;, first published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on July 12, 1987. He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.

Blakemore&#x27;s general argument is that the film is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. The date of the final photograph, July 4, is meant to be ironic. Blakemore writes:
Film writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of American imperialism. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a Fourth of July party, or Jack&#x27;s earlier reference to the Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, which was written to advocate the American colonial seizure of the Philippine islands, justifying imperial conquest as a mission of civilization.

The artwork of Indigenous Canadian artist Norval Morrisseau can be seen throughout the film, including the paintings &quot;The Great Earth Mother&quot; (1976), and &quot;Flock of Loons&quot; (1975).

==== Geoffrey Cocks and Kubrick&#x27;s concern with the Holocaust ====
Film historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore&#x27;s idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s concerns about the Holocaust (both Cocks&#x27;s book and Michael Herr&#x27;s memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind). Cocks, writing in his book &quot;The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust&quot;, proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick&#x27;s work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a holocaust subtext in &quot;The Shining&quot;. This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick&#x27;s screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel&#x27;s supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone. Cocks places Kubrick&#x27;s vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane&#x27;s short story &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot; (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture.

Cocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick&#x27;s use of Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening of Jacob&quot; to accompany Jack Torrance&#x27;s dream of killing his family and Danny&#x27;s vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust.

Cocks&#x27;s work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, though sometimes with skepticism. Julian Rice, writing in the opening chapter of his book &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s Hope&quot;, believes Cocks&#x27;s views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained &quot;critical leaps&quot; of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick&#x27;s mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust) but Kubrick&#x27;s art is not governed by this one obsession. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for &quot;The Shining&quot;, commented on Cocks&#x27;s observations, saying that preoccupation with the Holocaust on Kubrick&#x27;s part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.

=== Literary allusions ===
Geoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy-tales, both &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, with Jack Torrance identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for &quot;all the asocial unconscious devouring powers&quot; that must be overcome by a child&#x27;s ego.

The saying &quot;all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; appeared first in James Howell&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish&quot; (1659).

=== Artworks in the film ===
Numerous paintings and sculptures appear throughout the film. Several paintings by Group of Seven artists appear including &quot;The Solemn Land&quot; (1921) by J. E. H. MacDonald, &quot;Northern River&quot; (1914) by Tom Thomson, &quot;Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay&quot; (1921) by Frederick Varley, &quot;Red Maple&quot; (1914) by A. Y. Jackson, &quot;Mist Fantasy, Sand River, Algoma&quot; (1920) by J.E.H. MacDonald, &quot;Maligne Lake, Jasper Park&quot; (1924) by Lawren Harris, &quot;Beaver Swamp&quot; (1920) by Lawren Harris, and &quot;Arpeggio&quot; (1932) by Frederick Varley. Two paintings by Indigenous Canadian artist Norval Morrisseau can be seen in the film: &quot;The Great Earth Mother&quot; (1976) and &quot;Flock of Loons&quot; (1975)––Morriseau was part of the Professional Native Indian Artists Inc. (PNIAI) which came to be informally known as the &quot;Indian Group of Seven&quot;.

Many of the paintings that appear include depictions of Canada or are painted by Canadian artists including &quot;Le Campement du Trappeur&quot; (1931) by Clarence Gagnon, &quot;December Afternoon&quot; (1969) by Hugh Monahan, &quot;Log Hut on the St. Maurice&quot; (1862) and &quot;Paysage d’hiver, Laval&quot; (1849) by Cornelius Krieghoff, &quot;After The Bath&quot; (1890) by Paul Peel, &quot;Site du : &quot;Combat de la Grange&quot; September 25, 1775&quot; (1839) by Louise-Amélie Panet, &quot;Starlight: Indian Papoose&quot; (n.d.) and &quot;Chief Bear Paw&quot; (n.d.) by Nicholas Raphael de Grandmaison, &quot;Montreal from the Mountain&quot; (1838) by William Henry Bartlett, &quot;Makah Returning in their War Canoes&quot; (1845–1859) by Paul Kane, &quot;Mill on the Cliff&quot; (n.d.) by Nicholas Hornyansky, &quot;The Johnson House, Hanover&quot; (1932–42) by Carl Schaefer, and &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hawk&quot; (1974) and &quot;Glaucous-Winged Gull&quot; (1973) by J. Fenwick Lansdowne.

A number of paintings by Alex Colville make appearances including &quot;Woman and Terrier&quot; (1963), &quot;Horse and Train&quot; (1954), &quot;Hound in Field (1958)&quot;, &quot;Dog, Boy, and St. John River&quot; (1958), and &quot;Moon and Cow&quot; (1963).

Several portraits by Dorothy Oxborough of children from the Bearspaw band of the Stoney/Nakoda people appear in the film. Oxborough&#x27;s portraits were often reproduced as decorative prints, framed souvenirs, greeting cards, novelties, and calendars. Oxborough, born in Calgary, Alberta, was criticized for infantilizing and culturally insensitive depictions of indigenous people.

Four etchings by John Webber appear in the film, &quot;A Man of Nootka Sound&quot; (1778), &quot;A Woman of Oonalashka&quot; (1784), &quot;A Woman of Prince William Sound&quot; (1784), and &quot;A Man of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; (1777). Webber accompanied James Cook on his third voyage to Hawaii, New Zealand, and Vancouver Island.

=== Ambiguities in the film ===
Roger Ebert notes that the film does not really have a &quot;reliable observer&quot;, with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann. Ebert believes various events call into question the reliability of Jack, Wendy and Danny. This leads Ebert to conclude that:

Ebert concludes that &quot;The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them&quot;. The film critic James Berardinelli notes that &quot;King would have us believe that the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers.&quot; He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of &quot;madness and the unreliable narrator&quot;.

=== Ghosts versus cabin fever ===
In some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts, he is always facing a mirror or, in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes &quot;It has been pointed out that there&#x27;s a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.&quot;
In &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Stephen King&quot;, Tony Magistrale wrote,
Kubrick&#x27;s reliance on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic meaning of this film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through ... these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel&#x27;s methodical assault on Torrance&#x27;s identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance&#x27;s perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore, the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he &quot;speaks&quot; to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel&#x27;s &quot;consciousness&quot;, because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.
Ghosts are the implied explanation for Jack&#x27;s seemingly physically impossible escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview of Kubrick by scholar Michel Ciment, the director made comments about the scene in the book that may imply he similarly thought of the scene in the film as a key reveal in this dichotomy:
It seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: &#x27;Jack must be imagining these things because he&#x27;s crazy.&#x27; This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing ... It&#x27;s not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.
=== Two Gradys and other doubles ===
Early in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as &quot;Delbert&quot; Grady.

Gordon Dahlquist of &quot;The Kubrick FAQ&quot; argues that the name change &quot;deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the 1920s July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has &#x27;always&#x27; been at the Overlook. It&#x27;s a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that &quot;The Shining&quot; brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert&#x27;s legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as &#x27;caretaker&#x27; to the interests of the powerful. It&#x27;s the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.&quot;

Dahlquist&#x27;s argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two people or the same are two &#x27;manifestations&#x27; of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel&#x27;s murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance but nor is he someone different. Jack in the photo has &#x27;always&#x27; been at the Overlook; Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film&#x27;s assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that &#x27;the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly&#x27;.&quot;

Among Kubrick&#x27;s other doubling/mirroring effects in the film:
* In the U.S. version, Jack&#x27;s interview with Ullman, whose confident affability contrasts with Jack&#x27;s seemingly forced nonchalance, is paired with Wendy&#x27;s meeting with a female doctor, whose somber and professional manner contrasts with Wendy&#x27;s nervousness.
* During the interview, Jack and Ullman are joined by a hotel employee named Bill Watson, who looks similar to Jack from behind, creating a pseudo–mirror image effect as they sit in chairs to the front-left and front-right of Ullman&#x27;s desk.
* The Grady sisters look so similar that they appear to be twins, though they are different ages (Ullman states that he thinks that they were about eight and ten).
* On two occasions, Ullman says goodbye to two young female employees and in the second case, they closely resemble each other.
* The film contains two mazes, the hedges outside and, per Wendy&#x27;s characterization, the Overlook. The hedge maze appears in two forms, the 13-foot-high version outside and the model inside the Overlook. In the overhead shot zooming down on Wendy and Danny in the center of the maze, the maze differs from the map outside and from the model having far more corridors, and the left and right sides are mirror images of each other. The Overlook significantly breaks down into two sections, one old and one remodeled; one past, one present.
* Two versions of the bathing woman inhabit Room 237.
* In Hallorann&#x27;s Miami bedroom, two paintings showing similar nude black women are seen on opposite walls just before he experiences a &quot;shining&quot;.
* There appear to be two Jack Torrances, the one who goes mad and freezes to death in the present and the one who appears in a 1921 photograph that hangs on the gold corridor wall inside the Overlook.

=== Photograph ===
At the end of the film, the camera moves slowly toward a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, revealed to include Jack seen at the middle of a July 4, 1921, party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick said that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. This has not stopped alternative readings, such as that Jack has been &quot;absorbed&quot; into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote:

As the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men&#x27;s toilet, &#x27;You&#x27;re the caretaker, sir. You&#x27;ve always been the caretaker.&#x27; Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it&#x27;s his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it&#x27;s right at the center of the central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe&#x27;s purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.

=== Spatial layout of the Overlook Hotel ===
Screenwriter Todd Alcott has noted:

Artist Juli Kearns first identified and created maps of spatial discrepancies in the layout of the Overlook Hotel, the interiors of which were constructed in studios in England. These spatial discrepancies included windows appearing in impossible places, such as in Stuart Ullman&#x27;s office, which is surrounded by interior hallways, and apartment doorways positioned in places where they cannot possibly lead to apartments. Rob Ager is another proponent of this theory. Jan Harlan, an Executive Producer on &quot;The Shining&quot;, was asked about the discontinuity of sets by Xan Brooks of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and confirmed the discontinuity was intentional, &quot;The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made not to know where they&#x27;re going. People say &quot;The Shining&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense. Well spotted! It&#x27;s a ghost movie. It&#x27;s not supposed to make sense.&quot; Harlan further elaborated to Kate Abbot, &quot;Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed – and wrote a much more ambiguous script. It&#x27;s clear instantly there&#x27;s something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside – but the interiors don&#x27;t make sense. Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn&#x27;t fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Before making &quot;The Shining&quot;, Kubrick directed the film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the European aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;″s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally, one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer&#x27;s work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading a copy of the manuscript of &quot;The Shining&quot;&quot;.

Speaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that &quot;there&#x27;s something inherently wrong with the human personality. There&#x27;s an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Nicholson was Kubrick&#x27;s first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who said the film gave him nightmares for a month), Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King&#x27;s disapproval. Kris Kristofferson was Kubrick&#x27;s backup choice if Nicholson had declined. King, for his part, disavowed Nicholson because he thought that, since his part in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the viewer would tend to consider him an unstable individual from the beginning. For this reason, King preferred Jon Voight, Michael Moriarty, or Martin Sheen for the role, who would more faithfully represent the profile of the ordinary individual who is gradually driven to madness. In any case, from the beginning the writer was told that the actor for the lead role &quot;was not negotiable.&quot;

Although Nicholson initially suggested that Jessica Lange would be a better fit for the role of Wendy, Shelley Duvall knew early that she was the one cast for the role (Nicholson would work with Lange on his next movie, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;). Wendy&#x27;s character in the film differs from the novel, appearing less capable and more vulnerable. Throughout filming, Kubrick pushed Duvall, she said, &quot;to get the performance out of me that he wanted&quot;.

Slim Pickens was offered the role of Dick Hallorann, and told Kubrick that he would take the role only if his scenes in the film were shot in fewer than 100 takes. Kubrick declined, and Scatman Crothers got the part after he had been suggested by Pickens&#x27;s agent.

The director&#x27;s initial candidate to play the Torrances&#x27; son was Cary Guffey (&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;), but the young actor&#x27;s parents refused, saying the film was too gruesome for a child. In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband-and-wife team, Leon (who portrayed Lord Bullingdon in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;) and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent that fell between Jack Nicholson&#x27;s and Shelley Duvall&#x27;s speech patterns, with Nicholson coming from New Jersey and Duvall from Texas. During the filming, the young actor selected, Danny Lloyd, was protected in a special way by Kubrick; the boy believed at all times that he was shooting a drama, not a horror movie. Following his role in the 1982 film &quot;&quot;, Lloyd abandoned his acting career.

=== Filming ===

Main photography began in May 1978 and wrapped in July 1979, it took place mainly in Elstree Studios, in southern England.

==== Interior sets ====

Having chosen King&#x27;s novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. To enable him to shoot the scenes in loose chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel. In February 1979, the Colorado Lounge set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.

==== Exterior locations ====

While most of the film was shot on interior sets and the full-scale exterior facade replica at Elstree Studios, a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan shot some sequences on location in the American West. Saint Mary Lake and its Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana were featured in the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road. The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the establishing shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; absent in these shots is the hedge maze, which the real Timberline Lodge does not have. The Ahwahnee Hotel (the Overlook Hotel&#x27;s main interior reference) and the Timberline Lodge (the hotel&#x27;s main exterior) were both designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.

Outtakes of the opening panorama shots were later used by Ridley Scott for the closing moments of the original cut of the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982).

=== Writing ===
In 1977, a Warner Bros. executive, John Calley, sent Kubrick the proofs of what would become the novel. Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of &quot;Carrie&quot;, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world.

Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer (and brother-in-law) Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to &quot;try&quot; in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King&#x27;s novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract.

The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of novelist Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that &quot;would imply the possibility that there was something after death,&quot; and he did not believe there was anything, &quot;not even hell.&quot; Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine &quot;Positif&quot;, she stated:

Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript:

=== Photography ===

&quot;The Shining&quot; had a very prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick&#x27;s highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall frequently argued with Kubrick on set about lines in the script and her acting techniques. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days. Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the &quot;bar scene&quot; for six weeks and that the shoot day lasted from 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day&#x27;s shoot. He also described it as his favorite scene in the film.

For the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, &quot;but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake. He told them to act naturally to give the scene a chilling sense of time-tripping realism as Jack walks from the seventies into the roaring twenties&quot;.

For the international versions of the film, Kubrick shot different takes of Wendy reading the typewriter pages containing &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; in different languages. For each language, a suitable idiom was used: German (&quot;Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf Morgen&quot; / &quot;Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today&quot;), Italian (&quot;Il mattino ha l&#x27;oro in bocca&quot; / &quot;The morning has gold in its mouth&quot;), French (&quot;Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l&#x27;auras»&quot; / &quot;One &#x27;here you go&#x27; is worth more than two &#x27;you&#x27;ll have it, the equivalent of &quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&quot;), Spanish (&quot;No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano&quot; / &quot;No matter how early you get up, you can&#x27;t make the sun rise any sooner.&quot;)

The door that Jack chops through with the axe near the end of the film was real; Kubrick originally shot this scene with a fake door, but Nicholson, who had worked as a volunteer fire marshal and a firefighter in the California Air National Guard, tore through it too quickly. Jack&#x27;s line, &quot;Heeeere&#x27;s Johnny!&quot;, is taken from Ed McMahon&#x27;s introduction to &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and was improvised by Nicholson. Kubrick, who had lived in England for some time, was unaware of the significance of the line, and nearly used a different take. Later that year, Carson would use this clip to open his 18th anniversary show.

During production, Kubrick screened David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977) to the cast and crew, to convey the mood he wanted to achieve for the film.

The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; gave the record for the scene with the most retakes in cinematic history to the sequence where Wendy walks backward up the stairs fending off Jack with a baseball bat, at 127 times. In July 2020, Guinness updated the record to 148 takes, for the scene where Danny and Dick Hallorann discuss the ability to shine. In his 2024 book dedicated to &quot;The Shining&quot;, Lee Unkrich disputes the 127 takes claim, writing, &quot;It was reported by a crew member who wasn&#x27;t even on the set when it was shot ...The shot that has the most takes in the entire film [66] that no one talks about is the big, long dolly shot that brought Jack and Wendy and the hotel manager into the Gold Ballroom at the beginning of the movie.&quot;

==== Steadicam ====
&quot;The Shining&quot; was among the early half-dozen films (after the films &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, and &quot;Rocky&quot;, all released in 1976), to use the newly developed Steadicam, a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator&#x27;s movement from the camera&#x27;s, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface. It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of &quot;The Shining&quot;. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered &quot;further possibilities for the Steadicam&quot;. This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not &quot;just talking of stunt shots and staircases&quot;. Rather he would use the Steadicam &quot;as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it&#x27;s wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane&quot;. Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames. Brown published an article in &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; about his experience, and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.
Kubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam&#x27;s video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick&#x27;s film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:
This required the Steadicam to be on a special mount resembling a wheelchair, in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform successive identical takes. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.

=== Music and soundtrack ===
The stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.

The soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music. The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.

The non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:

# &quot;Dies Irae&quot; segment from &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; by Hector Berlioz, performed by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind
# &quot;Lontano&quot; by György Ligeti, Ernest Bour conducting the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra (Wergo Records)

# &quot;Utrenja&quot; – excerpts from the &quot;Ewangelia&quot; and &quot;Kanon Paschalny II&quot; movements by Krzysztof Penderecki, Andrzej Markowski conducting the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra (Polskie Nagrania Records)
# &quot;The Awakening of Jacob&quot;, &quot;De Natura Sonoris No. 1&quot; (the latter not on the soundtrack album, Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Henryk Czyż) and &quot;De Natura Sonoris No. 2&quot; by Krzysztof Penderecki (Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrzej Markowski, Polskie Nagrania Records)

# &quot;Kanon&quot; (for string orchestra) by Krzysztof Penderecki
# &quot;Polymorphia&quot; (for string orchestra) by Krzysztof Penderecki, Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Henryk Czyż

Upon their arrival at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown the first version of the film by Kubrick: &quot;The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn&#x27;t know what was going to be used for sure&quot;. After having something similar happen to her on &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick&#x27;s actions that she vowed never to work with him again. She and Elkind had considered legal action against Kubrick, but because no formal contract was in place, they reluctantly accepted the situation. Carlos&#x27;s own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her &quot;Rediscovering Lost Scores&quot; compilation.

== Release ==
Unlike Kubrick&#x27;s previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, &quot;The Shining&quot; initially opened on 10 screens in New York City and Los Angeles on the Memorial Day weekend, then was released as a mass-market film nationwide within a month. The European release of &quot;The Shining&quot; a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick&#x27;s removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.

=== Post-release edit ===
After its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman, who explains that Jack&#x27;s body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film&#x27;s distributor. This cut the film&#x27;s running time to 144 minutes. Roger Ebert commented: 

The general consensus among those who saw the first few shows was that the film was better without it because keeping it would weaken the Overlook&#x27;s threat to the family and reintroduce Ullman, who had barely had a leading role in the story, into the conflict. Co-writer Diane Johnson revealed that Kubrick had a certain &quot;compassion&quot; from the beginning for the fate of Wendy and Danny, and in that sense the hospital scene would give a sense of a return to normality. Johnson, on the other hand, was in favor of a more tragic outcome: she proposed the death of Danny Torrance. For Shelley Duvall, &quot;Kubrick was wrong, because the scene explained some important things, such as the meaning of the yellow ball and the role that the hotel manager played in the intrigue.&quot; Kubrick decided that the film worked better without the scene.

=== European version ===
For its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film. The excised scenes included: a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel; Danny being attended by a doctor (Anne Jackson), including references to Tony and how Jack once injured Danny in a drunken rage; more footage of Hallorann&#x27;s attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm, including a sequence with a garage attendant (Tony Burton); extended dialogue scenes at the hotel; and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax. Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print, despite their scenes having been excised from the movie. According to Harlan, Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was &quot;not very well received&quot;, and also after Warner Brothers had complained about its ambiguity and length.

The scene when Jack writes obsessively on the typewriter &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; was re-shot a number of times, but changing the language of the typed copy to Italian, French, Spanish, and German, in order to match the respective dubbed languages.

Three alternative takes were used in a British television commercial.

=== Home media ===
The U.S. network television premiere of &quot;The Shining&quot; (on &quot;ABC&#x27;s Friday Night Movie&quot; of May 6, 1983) started with a placard saying, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Film Deals With the Supernatural, As a Possessed Man Attempts to Destroy His Family.&quot; With the movie&#x27;s ambiguities, it is not known how Kubrick felt about or if he agreed with this proclamation. The placard also said that the film was edited for television and warned about the content.

DVDs in both regions contain a candid fly-on-the-wall 33-minute documentary made by Kubrick&#x27;s daughter Vivian (who was 17 when she filmed it) entitled &quot;Making The Shining&quot;, originally shown on British television in 1980. She also provided an audio commentary track about her documentary for its DVD release. It appears even on pre-2007 editions of &quot;The Shining&quot; on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and very private moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying playing up to the behind-the-scenes camera.

In May 2019, it was announced that the film would be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in October. The release includes a 4K remaster using a 4K scan of the original 35 mm negative. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg and Kubrick&#x27;s former personal assistant Leon Vitali closely assisted Warner Bros. in the mastering process. This is the same cut and 4K restoration that was screened at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. According to the official press release, the official full-length run-time is 146 minutes.

=== Ad campaigns ===
Various theatrical posters were used during the original 1980–1981 international release cycle, but in the U.S., where the film first opened, the primary poster and newspaper advert was designed by noted Hollywood graphic designer Saul Bass. Bass and Kubrick reportedly went through over 300 potential designs before settling on the final design of an unsettling, angry-looking, underlit, pointillistic doll-like face (which does not appear in the film) peering through the letters &quot;&quot;, with &quot;SHiNiNG&quot; below, in smaller letters. At the top of the poster are the words &quot;A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN HORROR&quot;, with the credits and other information at the bottom.

The correspondence between the two men during the design process survives, including Kubrick&#x27;s handwritten critiques on Bass&#x27;s different proposed designs. Bass originally intended the poster to be black on a red background, but Kubrick, to Bass&#x27;s dismay, chose to make the background yellow. In response, Bass commissioned a small, silkscreened print run of his original version, which also lacks the &quot;masterpiece of modern horror&quot; slogan, and has the credits in a compact white block at the bottom.

=== 4K version ===
Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events had a limited screening in October 2016 in 2K and 4K resolution.

In April 2019, a 4K resolution remastered version from a new scan of the original 35 mm camera negative of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The length is listed as 146 minutes and 143 minutes.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Shining&quot; opened on the same weekend as &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; but was released on 10 screens and grossed $622,337 for the four-day weekend, the third highest-grossing opening weekend from fewer than 50 screens of all time, behind &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Rose&quot; (1979). It had a per-screen average gross of $62,234 compared to $50,919 for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; from 126 screens.

=== Initial reviews ===
The film had mixed reviews at the time of its opening in the United States. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Nicholson&#x27;s performance and praised the Overlook Hotel as an effective setting for horror, but wrote that &quot;the supernatural story knows frustratingly little rhyme or reason ... Even the film&#x27;s most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; was critical, stating &quot;With everything to work with ... Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King&#x27;s bestseller.&quot; A common initial criticism was the slow pacing, which was highly atypical of horror films of the time.

Neither Gene Siskel nor Roger Ebert reviewed the film on their television show &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; when it was first released, but in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters. In his &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; review, Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and called it &quot;a crashing disappointment. The biggest surprise is that it contains virtually no thrills. Given Kubrick&#x27;s world-class reputation, one&#x27;s immediate reaction is that maybe he was after something other than thrills in the film. If so, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what.&quot; Vincent Misiano&#x27;s review in &quot;Ares&quot; magazine concluded: &quot;&quot;The Shining&quot; lays open to view all the devices of horror and suspense – endless eerie music, odd camera angles, a soundtrack of interminably pounding heart, hatchets and hunts. The result is shallow, self-conscious and dull. Read the book.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;There are moments so visually stunning only a Kubrick could pull them off, yet the film is too grandiose to be the jolter that horror pictures are expected to be. Both those expecting significance from Kubrick and those merely looking for a good scare may be equally disappointed.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated &quot;Again and again, the movie leads us to expect something – almost promises it – and then disappoints us.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s production of &quot;The Shining&quot;, a ponderous, lackluster distillation of Stephen King&#x27;s best-selling novel, looms as the Big Letdown of the new film season. I can&#x27;t recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic described The Shining as &#x27;laborious filmmaking&#x27; and &#x27;a grab bag of spook stuff, with no rhyme or reason of its own&#x27; and that Nicholson&#x27;s &#x27;mouthy work here makes the late Bela Lugosi look conservative&#x27;.

It was one of two films of Kubrick&#x27;s last eleven films, the other being &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, to receive no nominations from the BAFTAs. It was the only one of Kubrick&#x27;s last nine films to receive no nominations from either the Oscars or Golden Globes. Instead, it was Kubrick&#x27;s only film to be nominated at the Razzie Awards, including Worst Director and Worst Actress (Duvall), in the first year that award was given. These nominations, especially Duvall&#x27;s, have provoked backlash and controversy for years, with Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson defending his choice claiming he expected the adaptation to be more similar to the book. Razzies co-founder Maureen Murphy stated in 2022 that she regretted giving Duvall the Worst Actress nomination. On March 31, 2022, the Razzie committee officially rescinded Duvall&#x27;s nomination, stating &quot;We have since discovered that Duvall&#x27;s performance was impacted by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s treatment of her throughout the production.&quot;

=== Reappraisal ===
According to Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 105 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though it deviates from Stephen King&#x27;s novel, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; is a chilling, often baroque journey into madness — exemplified by an unforgettable turn from Jack Nicholson.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Tim Cahill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted in an interview with Kubrick that by 1987 there was already a &quot;critical re-evaluation of [&quot;The Shining&quot;] in process&quot;.

In 2001, the film was ranked 29th on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills list and Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains list in 2003. In 2005, the quote &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; was ranked 68 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list. It had Channel 4&#x27;s all-time scariest moment, and Bravo TV named one of the film&#x27;s scenes sixth on their list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. Film critics Kim Newman and Jonathan Romney both placed it in their top ten lists for the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll. In 2005, &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;The Shining&quot; as the 5th-greatest horror film of all time. In 2012, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll ranked it the 75th greatest film of all time. Director Martin Scorsese placed it on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Mathematicians at King&#x27;s College London (KCL) used statistical modeling in a study commissioned by Sky Movies to conclude that &quot;The Shining&quot; was the &quot;perfect scary movie&quot; due to a proper balance of various ingredients including shock value, suspense, gore and size of the cast.

In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked it as the 5th &quot;best horror film of all time&quot;. It was voted the 62nd greatest American film ever made in a 2015 poll conducted by BBC. In 2017, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers&#x27; poll ranked the film at No. 35 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;, and in 2023 Empire also ranked it No. 1 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best Horror Movies&quot;. In 2021, The film was ranked at No. 2 by &quot;Time Out&quot; on their list of &quot;The 100 best horror movies&quot;. Critics, scholars, and crew members (such as Kubrick&#x27;s producer Jan Harlan) have discussed the film&#x27;s enormous influence on popular culture. In 2006, Roger Ebert, who was initially critical of the work, inducted the film into his Great Movies series, saying &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s cold and frightening &quot;The Shining&quot; challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? ... It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick&#x27;s film so strangely disturbing.&quot;

Anne Billson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Duvall&#x27;s horrified reactions as her husband reveals himself to be a mortal threat provide the film with many of its iconic moments.&quot; Bilge Ebiri of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote: &quot;Looking into Duvall&#x27;s huge eyes from the front row of a theater, I found myself riveted by a very poignant form of fear. Not the fear of an actor out of her element, or the more mundane fear of a victim being chased around by an ax-wielding maniac. Rather, it was something far more disquieting, and familiar: the fear of a wife who&#x27;s experienced her husband at his worst, and is terrified that she&#x27;ll experience it again.&quot; Jessica Jalali of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it the best performance of her career, calling her &quot;the heart of the film; she is out of her depth in dealing with her husband&#x27;s looming insanity while trying to protect her young son, all while being fearful of the malevolence around her&quot;. Tim Grierson of RogerEbert.com similarly called it one of her best performances, writing that &quot;This is no simple &quot;scream queen&quot; performance as Duvall makes Wendy&#x27;s terror and determination grippingly, movingly real. Did Kubrick push her to extremes to reach such heights? Perhaps, but the accomplishment is Duvall&#x27;s, full stop.&quot;

Horror film critic Peter Bracke, reviewing the Blu-ray release in &quot;High-Def Digest&quot;, wrote:

In 1999, Jonathan Romney discussed Kubrick&#x27;s perfectionism and dispelled others&#x27; initial arguments that the film lacked complexity: &quot;The final scene alone demonstrates what a rich source of perplexity &quot;The Shining&quot; offers... look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox&quot;. Romney further explains:
=== Response by Stephen King ===

Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could &quot;remember hating&quot;. In his 1981 nonfiction book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, he noted that Kubrick was among those &quot;filmmakers whose particular visions are so clear and fierce that... fear of failure never becomes a factor in the equation,&quot; commenting that &quot;even when a director such as Stanley Kubrick makes such a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film as &quot;The Shining&quot;, it somehow retains a brilliance that is inarguable; it is simply there,&quot; and listed Kubrick&#x27;s film among those he considered to have &quot;contributed something of value to the [horror] genre.&quot; Before the 1980 film, King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.

The novel, written while King was suffering from alcoholism, contains an autobiographical element. King expressed disappointment that some themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less present in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would go insane, due to Nicholson&#x27;s famous role as Randle McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975). King had suggested that a more &quot;everyman&quot; actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack&#x27;s descent into madness would be more unnerving. In the novel, the story takes the child&#x27;s point of view, while in the film the father is the main character; in fact, one of the most notable differences lies in Jack Torrance&#x27;s psychological profile. According to the novel, the character represented an ordinary and balanced man who little by little loses control; furthermore, the written narration reflected personal traits of the author himself at that time (marked by insomnia and alcoholism), in addition to abuse. There is some allusion to these episodes in the American version of the film.

In an interview with the BBC, King criticized Kubrick&#x27;s Wendy, stating that she is &quot;basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that&#x27;s not the woman that I wrote about.&quot; King&#x27;s Wendy is a strong and independent woman on a professional and emotional level; to Kubrick, on the other hand, it did not seem consistent that such a woman had long endured the personality of Jack Torrance.

King once suggested that he disliked the film&#x27;s downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite:

King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make – whether it&#x27;s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety – are what matter to him. But in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It&#x27;s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King&#x27;s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like &quot;insects&quot; because the director doesn&#x27;t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick&#x27;s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick&#x27;s, the monster is Kubrick.

King later criticized the film and Kubrick as a director:
 Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn&#x27;t grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn&#x27;t believe, he couldn&#x27;t make the film believable to others. What&#x27;s basically wrong with Kubrick&#x27;s version of &quot;The Shining&quot; is that it&#x27;s a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that&#x27;s why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should. 

King was disappointed by Kubrick&#x27;s decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). He supervised the 1997 television adaptation, also titled &quot;The Shining&quot;, filmed at The Stanley Hotel.

The animosity of King toward Kubrick&#x27;s adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick&#x27;s adaptation, he found it to be &quot;dreadfully unsettling&quot;. Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it, &quot;of course there was Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s movie which many seem to remember – for reasons I have never quite understood – as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.&quot;

Mike Flanagan, director of the film adaptation of &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, would reconcile the differences between novel and film versions of &quot;The Shining&quot; there. &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; is a direct adaptation of its novel counterpart, which itself is a sequel to the novel version of &quot;The Shining&quot;, but is also a continuation of Kubrick&#x27;s film; in explaining the latter, Flanagan expressed, &quot;&quot;The Shining&quot; is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have. There&#x27;s no other language to tell that story in. If you say &#x27;Overlook Hotel&#x27;, I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can&#x27;t pretend that isn&#x27;t the case&quot;. King initially rejected Flanagan&#x27;s pitch of bringing back the Overlook as seen in Kubrick&#x27;s film, but changed his mind after Flanagan pitched a scene within the hotel near the end of the film that served as his reason to bring back the Overlook. Upon reading the script, King was so satisfied with the result that he said, &quot;Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of &quot;The Shining&quot; is redeemed for me here.&quot;

== Comparison with the novel ==
The film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action. The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the film).

=== Motivation of ghosts ===
In the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to &quot;reclaim&quot; Jack (although Grady expresses an interest in Danny&#x27;s &quot;shining&quot; ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack&#x27;s repeated claims to have &quot;not just a &quot;déjà vu&quot;&quot;. The film is more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.

=== Room number ===
The room number 217 has been changed to 237. Timberline Lodge, located on Mount Hood in Oregon, was used for the aerial exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in &quot;The Shining&quot;, because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel&#x27;s expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.

There are fringe analyses relating this number change to rumors that Kubrick faked the first Moon landing, as there are approximately 237,000 miles between the Earth and the Moon (average is 238,855 miles), and claiming that the film is a subtle confession of his involvement. Another theory posits an obsession with the number 42 in the film, and the product of the digits in 237 is 42.

=== Jack Torrance ===
The novel initially presents Jack as likable and well-intentioned, yet haunted by the demons of alcohol and authority issues. Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by what he sees as the evil forces in the hotel.
At the novel&#x27;s conclusion, it is suggested that the evil hotel forces have possessed Jack&#x27;s body and proceeded to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny. He leaves a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Hallorann escape.
The film&#x27;s Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film.

Only in the novel does Jack hear the haunting, heavy-handed voice of his father, with whom he had a troubled relationship. In both media, Jack&#x27;s encounter with the ghostly bartender is pivotal to his deterioration. The novel gives much more detail about his alcoholism.

The film prolongs Jack&#x27;s struggle with writer&#x27;s block. Kubrick&#x27;s co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King&#x27;s novel, Jack&#x27;s discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel, which gives him new ideas for a novel, catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father&#x27;s change less motivated. Kubrick showed Jack&#x27;s continued blockage quite late in the film with the &quot;all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; scene, which does not appear in the novel.

Stephen King stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 miniseries of &quot;The Shining&quot; that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing. Tony Magistrale wrote about Kubrick&#x27;s version of Jack Torrance in &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Stephen King&quot;:
From Thomas Allen Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist&#x27;s Maze&quot;: &quot;When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a &#x27;shining&#x27; over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny&#x27;s Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.&quot;
Jack&#x27;s tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny&#x27;s circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.

=== Danny Torrance ===
Danny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor. In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Hallorann, who also has these abilities. The same is true of Dick Hallorann, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the &quot;shining&quot; ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook. Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board. In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift.

Although Danny has supernatural powers in both versions, the novel makes it clear that his apparent imaginary friend &quot;Tony&quot; really is a projection of hidden parts of his own psyche, though heavily amplified by Danny&#x27;s psychic &quot;shining&quot; abilities. At the end it is revealed that Danny Torrance&#x27;s middle name is &quot;Anthony&quot;.

=== Wendy Torrance ===
Wendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents. In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Stephen King&quot;, author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:
[Rebecca] De Mornay restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King&#x27;s novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall&#x27;s exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as Olive Oyl revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.
Co-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall&#x27;s delivery. Johnson believes that the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more rounded character.

The &quot;Wendy Theory&quot; claims that Kubrick made Wendy, not Jack, the psychotic character. Shifts in continuity and camera placement are said to represent Wendy&#x27;s delusional perspective.

=== Stuart Ullman ===
In the novel, Jack&#x27;s interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film&#x27;s Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack&#x27;s well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired. Ullman&#x27;s bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack&#x27;s deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.

In &quot;Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation&quot;, author Greg Jenkins writes &quot;A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.&quot;

From &quot;Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist&#x27;s Maze&quot;: Ullman tells Jack that the hotel&#x27;s season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning that the Torrances moved in on Halloween (October 31). On Ullmann&#x27;s desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen – and a miniature replica of an ax.

&quot;When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who &#x27;seemed perfectly normal&#x27; but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack&#x27;s obvious interest (as if he&#x27;s recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film&#x27;s definition of his madness will be far more complex.&quot;

=== Family dynamics ===
Stephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, including revelations of Jack&#x27;s physical abuse of Danny and Wendy&#x27;s fear of Danny&#x27;s mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than King does. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack&#x27;s rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him. The exact opposite is true in the book, where Wendy occasionally experiences jealousy at the fact that Danny clearly prefers Jack to her.

=== Plot differences ===
In the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny; this does not occur in the film. Writing in &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, &quot;Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.&quot; In the novel, Jack&#x27;s final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him. The film ends with the hotel still standing. More broadly, the defective boiler is a major element of the novel&#x27;s plot, entirely missing from the film version.

Because of the limitations of special effects at the time, the living topiary animals of the novel were omitted and a hedge maze was added, acting as a final trap for Jack Torrance as well as a refuge for Danny.

In the film, the hotel possibly derives its malevolent energy from being built on a Native American burial ground. In the novel, the reason for the hotel&#x27;s manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King&#x27;s previous novel &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; as well as Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;: a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence. The film&#x27;s Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook. In the novel, Jack does a great deal of investigation of the hotel&#x27;s past through a scrapbook, a subplot almost omitted from the film aside from two touches: a brief appearance of the scrapbook beside the typewriter, and Jack&#x27;s statement to the ghost of Grady that he knows his face from an old newspaper article describing the latter&#x27;s horrific acts. Kubrick in fact shot a scene where Jack discovers the scrapbook but removed it during post-production, a decision which co-screenwriter Diane Johnson lamented.

Some of the film&#x27;s most iconic scenes, such as the ghost girls in the hallway, the torrent of blood from the elevators, and typewritten pages Wendy discovers on Jack&#x27;s desk, are unique to the film. Similarly, many of the most memorable lines of dialogue (&quot;Words of wisdom&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot;) are heard exclusively in the film.

=== Film adaptation commentary ===
Although Stephen King fans were critical of the novel&#x27;s adaptation on the grounds that Kubrick altered and reduced the novel&#x27;s themes, a defense of Kubrick&#x27;s approach was made in Steve Biodrowski&#x27;s review of the film. He argues that as in earlier films, Kubrick stripped out the back story of the film, reducing it to a &quot;basic narrative line&quot;, making the characters more like archetypes.
His review of the film is one of the few to go into detailed comparison with the novel. He writes, &quot;The result ... [is] a brilliant, ambitious attempt to shoot a horror film without the Gothic trappings of shadows and cobwebs so often associated with the genre.&quot;

== Influence in popular culture ==

Both parodies and homages to &quot;The Shining&quot; are prominent in UK and U.S. popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, video games and music. Images and scenes including the Grady girls in the hallway, the word &quot;Redrum&quot;, the blood spilling out of the elevator doors and Jack sticking his head through the hole in the bathroom door, saying, &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;, are frequently referenced in the media.

Director Tim Burton, who credits Kubrick as an influence, modeled the characters of Tweedledum and Tweedledee in his 2010 version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; on the Grady girls (like so many viewers of the film, Burton identifies the girls as twins in spite of Ullman&#x27;s dialogue to the contrary).

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; 1994 episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot; includes a parody titled &quot;The Shinning&quot;. Similarities include Sherri and Terri, the twins in Bart&#x27;s fourth grade class looking visually similar to the Grady girls, Homer writing &quot;No TV and No Beer Make Homer Go Crazy&quot; and Homer breaking into a room with an axe and uttering &#x27;here&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;, only to discover that he had entered the wrong room and using the introduction for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; instead. The season 30 2019 episode &quot;Girl&#x27;s in the Band&quot; has Homer, driven mad from working double shifts at the nuclear power plant, experiencing a Gold Room party scene with Lloyd followed by an axe-wielding Human Resources Director who resembles Nicholson&#x27;s character.

Dutch dance music duo Hocus Pocus sampled Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot; line in their 1993 dance song &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;. In 1995, the song reached number one in Australia for six weeks, making it the first dance single to do so without radio support in Australia.

American heavy metal band Slipknot pay homage to the film in their first music video for their 2000 song &quot;Spit It Out&quot;, directed by Thomas Mignone. The video consists of conceptual imagery of the band members each portraying characters enacting iconic scenes from the film, with Joey Jordison as Danny Torrance; Shawn Crahan and Chris Fehn as the Grady sisters; Corey Taylor as Jack Torrance; Mick Thomson as Lloyd the Bartender; Craig Jones as Dick Hallorann; James Root as Wendy Torrance; Paul Gray as Harry Derwent; and Sid Wilson as the corpse in the bathtub. The video was banned from MTV for overtly graphic and violent depictions, including Corey Taylor&#x27;s smashing through a door with an axe and the scene wherein James Root viciously assaults Corey Taylor with a baseball bat. Mignone and the band eventually re-edited a less violent version, which was subsequently aired on MTV.

The film&#x27;s haunted ballroom scene served as inspiration for English musician Leyland Kirby to create the Caretaker alias; his debut album &quot;Selected Memories from the Haunted Ballroom&quot; (1999) featured a prominent influence from the film.

American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars produced a music video for their 2006 single &quot;The Kill&quot; which is an extended homage to the film. The music video is set in a haunted hotel, and replicates imagery from the film including the black intertitles with white text, Jack&#x27;s typewriter, Lloyd&#x27;s bar, Jack bouncing a tennis ball against a wall, the ghostly woman in the bathroom, the murdered Grady sisters, and the hotel guest being fellated by another man dressed as a bear. The music video was directed by lead singer Jared Leto.

The film was played at the drive-in theater alongside &quot;Psycho&quot; as part of the Night of Horrors combo in &quot;Twister&quot; from 1996. In the 2003 animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, Bruce the shark says &quot;Here&#x27;s Brucey!&quot;, which is inspired from the &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; quote.

The 2017 song &quot;Enjoy Your Slay&quot; by American metalcore band Ice Nine Kills is inspired primarily by the novel as well as the film adaption. The song also features Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s grandson Sam Kubrick as guest vocalist.

The TV series &quot;Psych&quot; has a 2012 episode titled &quot;Heeeeere&#x27;s Lassie&quot; in which the plot and characters are based on the film. &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; was parodied by British comedian Lenny Henry in an advertisement for Premier Inn. It was banned from being screened on a children&#x27;s TV network.

Vince Gilligan, being a fan of Kubrick and his &quot;non-submersible moments&quot;, has included references to Kubrick movies in many of his works. &quot;I&#x27;m happy to see that his inspiration has shown in noticeable ways in our work in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;&quot;, says Gilligan. &quot;Breaking Bad&#x27;s&quot; 2010 episode &quot;Sunset&quot; has a cop radioing for assistance and begins, &quot;KDK-12&quot; – the radio address at the Overlook, before being axed. The axe-murdered Grady twins in &quot;The Shining&quot; are turned into the axe-murdering Salamanca twins in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. The descent of the main character, school teacher Walt, into the dark killer has some similarities to Jack&#x27;s arc. Reflections are used in both to show the characters change. &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; has a &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot; scare in an episode. Gilligan has also likened his early writing situation, getting snowed in and not writing, to feeling like Jack while going insane.

In Andy Muschietti&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;, which is based on &quot;It&quot;, another Stephen King book, Pennywise the Clown disguises himself as Henry Bowers while tormenting Beverly in a bathroom stall, and repeats the &quot;here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; line to her through the stall door. Bev nearly drowns in the blood that floods around her, similar to the wall of (what appears to be) blood in &quot;The Shining&quot;.

Steven Spielberg, a close friend of Kubrick, included a sequence dedicated to &quot;The Shining&quot; in the 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot; when they could not get rights to use &quot;Blade Runner&quot; for a similar sequence. The Overlook Hotel is recreated, including the Grady sisters, the elevator, room 237, the lady in the bath tub, the ballroom, and the 1921 photo, in addition to using the score the reference. Spielberg considered this inclusion a tribute to Kubrick.

In his 2019 novel &quot;The Institute&quot;, Stephen King refers to the film, writing, &quot;The little girls, Gerda and Greta, were standing and watching with wide, frightened eyes. They were holding hands and clutching dolls as identical as they were. They reminded Luke of twins in some old horror movie.&quot;

In 2020, the fifth-season episode &quot;Our Mojo&quot; of &quot;Lucifer&quot; paid homage to Kubrick and &quot;The Shining&quot; by having a young boy riding on a tricycle down a corridor in a hotel with wallpaper similar to the carpet pattern in the film.

As part of its &quot;A History of Ideas&quot; series, BBC Radio 4 produced a video illustrating Immanuel Kant&#x27;s concept of the categorical imperative outlined in &quot;On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives&quot;, using the characters and setting of &quot;The Shining&quot;. The video was narrated by Harry Shearer.
== Sequel and spin-off ==

In 2014, Warner Bros. Pictures began developing a film adaptation of &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; (2013), Stephen King&#x27;s sequel to his book, &quot;The Shining&quot; (1977). In 2016, Akiva Goldsman announced that he would write and produce the film for Warner Bros. For several years, Warner Brothers could not secure a budget for the sequel nor for a prequel to &quot;The Shining&quot; to be called &quot;Overlook Hotel&quot;.

In June 2019, writer and director Mike Flanagan confirmed &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; would be a sequel to both the 1980 film and King&#x27;s novel. It was released in several international territories on October 31, 2019, followed by the United States and Canada on November 8, 2019.

In April 2020, a spin-off titled &quot;Overlook&quot; entered development for HBO Max. In August 2021, HBO Max opted not to proceed with the project. It was soon after reported Netflix was a frontline bidder on the project, though they, too, eventually passed.

<doc id="1186617" wikidata="Q7564899" url="?curid=1186617" title="Sounds Like Canada">
<text>Sounds Like Canada was a Canadian radio program, which aired weekday mornings on CBC Radio One from 2002 to 2008. Until the end of May 2008, the program was hosted by the award-winning broadcaster Shelagh Rogers, and in the summers by a rotating series of guest hosts. The program was broadcast from Vancouver, and aired programming which covered cultural and human interest stories relevant to Canadians. Jian Ghomeshi, Jim Brown, Rick Cluff, Kevin Sylvester, Kathryn Gretsinger and Bill Richardson acted as guest hosts.

The show first aired in 2002, when Radio One management split its former morning program, &quot;This Morning&quot;, into two new programs: &quot;The Current&quot; took over the news portion of &quot;This Morning&quot;&#x27;s programming, and &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot; looked at the impact of the news on people.

Content on the program included conversations with people from all walks of life, people with and without titles. There were interviews with great thinkers such as Malcolm Gladwell and Thomas Homer Dixon, artists, musicians and writers. There were also penetrating series such as &quot;Our Home and Native Land&quot;, which examined issues in Aboriginal communities, and &quot;A Cruel Confusion&quot;, which took mental illness out of the shadows. It won the 2008 Media Award from the Canadian Mental Health Association.

&quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot; aired from 10:00 to 11:30 weekday mornings, and was followed by a half-hour information or radio drama series.

On all weekdays except Mondays, one feature from &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot; was repeated in the evenings on &quot;Nighttime Review&quot;. During the summer, the program broadcast with guest hosts as Sounds Like Canada in the Summer, and featured a mix of new and repeated features.

Following Rogers&#x27; announcement in the spring of 2008 that she would be leaving the program, the show ended its six-year run in September 2008. &quot;Q&quot; moved from its former afternoon slot to replace &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;.

<text>Classical Archives LLC is an online digital music store that solely focuses on classical music. Originally opening as the Classical MIDI Archives in 1994 primarily as a repository for free MIDI sequences of classical music works, in August 2000 the site incorporated as Classical Archives, LLC, and has since been also offering commercial label recordings for both streaming and downloading.

Both members and non-members can access detailed musicological information for each work: movements, genre, principal instruments, year of composition, and key. Additionally, nearly every composer&#x27;s biography is provided. Free radio streaming is available for computers and mobile devices that also includes a device to close the connection in one hour, if desired.

Classical Archives uses a proprietary system (called the Contextual Metadata Engine) that allows for the ingestion and cataloguing of all recordings based on musicological accurate and uniform metadata. Because of the Contextual Metadata Engine, visitors can search and cross-reference by various relevant criteria: composer, work title, artist, albums, historical period, instrument, and genre, in order to find and compare different recordings. The website also includes a section on composers (the greats, the notables or all), which include Leonard Berstein, George Gershwin and more.

Classical Archives was founded by CEO Pierre R. Schwob. The cataloguing of the Classical Archives database is carried out by a team of musicologists led by Chief Musicologist and Artistic Director Dr. Nolan Gasser.

==File types==
The site provides 320 kbit/s MP3 files for downloads and 160 kbit/s AAC files for streaming. Sample clips are streamed at 60 kbit/s for non-members.

==Database==
As of May 22, 2011, the Classical Archives database features 12,046 composers, 42,744 recording artists, and 26,697 Albums from 268 labels. These include the classical catalogues of Universal Music Group (Deutsche Grammophon, Decca, Phillips, ECM, etc.), Sony (RCA, Columbia, etc.), Naxos (BIS, Chandos, Hänssler Classic, etc.), and many independent labels through IODA (Harmonia Mundi, Nimbus, Summit, etc.).

<text>Frank Edward Young VC (2 October 1895 – 18 September 1918) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
The son of a serving soldier in the Bedfordshire Regiment, Frank Young was born in Cherat, British India on 2 October 1895. Having returned to Britain for his schooling, he joined the Hitchin Company of the Hertfordshire Regiment as a Boy Bugler in November 1909, serving as a part-time territorial soldier.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the Great War, Young was found medically unfit for overseas service and had to undergo an operation. In January 1915 he was passed fit and was posted with a reinforcement draft to 1/1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment, then serving as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. His father had rejoined the army and was serving as the battalion&#x27;s regimental sergeant major. Both father and son saw service through successive engagements in 1915, including the Battles of Festubert and Loos, and during this period the latter was promoted to sergeant. In 1916 he was appointed as a bombing instructor at the Rouen Central Bombing School, but was wounded in an accident. After a period of recovery Young was selected for officer training and was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant on 27 April 1917, being posted to a reserve battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment in Britain. Following an interlude training with the Royal Flying Corps, Young returned to the infantry and was sent to rejoin the 1/1st Hertfordshires in France on 12 September 1918, being appointed commander of No. 4 Company on arrival.

===Victoria Cross===
The action for which Second Lieutenant Young was to be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross occurred in the aftermath of Allied success at the Battle of Havrincourt. Soon after he rejoined 1/1st battalion, it was moved into the front-lines south east of Havrincourt, near a copse named Triangle Wood. In the late afternoon of 18 September 1918, after an intense artillery barrage, German troops launched an assault against this position. Although the enemy gained an initial foothold, ultimately the battalion&#x27;s line held and they were forced to withdraw. Young&#x27;s actions and leadership in the successful defence resulted in his award of the medal, the full citation for which was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 14 December 1918 and read:

Initially Young was listed as missing, however his body was found by a British patrol on 27 September at the edge of Havrincourt Wood. He was subsequently reburied nearby in Hermies Hill British Cemetery, Hermies. The grave stone is located at 3B5.

==The medal==
His VC is displayed at the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regimental Collection at the Wardown Park Museum, Luton, Bedfordshire.

<text>Second Lieutenant John Scott Youll VC (6 June 1897 – 27 October 1918) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
John Scott Youll was born in Thornley, Durham, County Durham, on 6 June 1897, the son of Richard William Youll and Margaret Youll, who lived at &quot;Thorncroft&quot;. His initial education was at Thornley Council School before becoming a technical student at a class held by the Durham County Council at Wingate. At the age of about fifteen he began to work for Thornley Colliery as an apprentice electrician.

The First World War began in the summer of 1914 but it was not until July 1915 before Youll entered military service, joining the Royal Engineers of the British Army and serving with the 1st Durham Engineers. After remaining in England for another year he was sent to the Western Front in August 1916. He was soon recommended for training to become an officer and returned to England in February 1917 to commence his training. In June he was gazetted as a temporary second lieutenant into the Northumberland Fusiliers (later the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers), before returning to the Western Front in late July.

He was 21 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, The Northumberland Fusiliers, British Army, attached to 11th (Service) Battalion during the First World War when the following deed took place at the battle of Asiago for which he was awarded the VC.

On 15 June 1918 south west of Asiago, Italy, Second Lieutenant Youll was commanding a patrol which came under heavy enemy fire. Sending his men back to safety he remained to watch the situation and then, unable to rejoin his company, he reported to a neighbouring unit where he took command of a party of men from different units, holding his position against enemy attack until a machine-gun opened fire behind him. He rushed and captured the gun, killing most of the team and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties. He then carried out three separate counterattacks, driving the enemy back each time.

He was killed in action during the battle of Vittorio Veneto, Italy, on 27 October 1918.

==Further information==
He was also the holder of the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. He is buried at Giavera British Cemetery, Treviso province.

In 2005, his home village of Thornley unveiled a memorial in his honour. The four faces of the memorial briefly detail his life, Army career and his Victoria Cross citation.

<text>Brisbane Correctional Centre, formerly the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre and also known as Wacol Prison, is a male prison facility located in the suburb of Wacol in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Opened in 1988, the prison complex was renovated and subsequently re-opened to inmates in June 2008.
The complex houses a water conservation system, a unit specifically designed for 17-year-old prisoners (which has since been closed due to amended laws), and an ultra-modern maximum security wing for prisoners considered dangerous. The facility currently consists of 16 units, including a protection unit mainly for elderly prisoners and prisoners with sexual charges, as well as a medical unit for prisoners with serious psychological problems and suicidal thoughts. A typical unit has approximately 70 prisoners.

==Notable prisoners==
* Brenden Abbottthe &quot;Postcard Bandit&quot;.
* Geoffrey Robert Dobbslabelled Australia&#x27;s worst paedophile, pleaded guilty to 124 sex offences and one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice on counts against 63 girls under his care as a teacher and youth leader from 1972 to 2000.

<text>Bunny Watson was a Canadian radio program, which aired Saturdays on CBC Radio One and Sundays on CBC Radio Two.

Named for Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s librarian character in the movie &quot;Desk Set&quot;, the show was hosted by Bill Richardson and produced by Jennifer Van Evra and Tod Elvidge in Vancouver. Inspired by the Hepburn character&#x27;s quote that she &quot;associates many things with many things&quot;, Richardson explored a particular theme each week through a free-association sequencing of music, literature and film.

The show first aired in the summer of 2004. In one of the show&#x27;s most notable episodes, on October 2, 2004, the poet and performance artist Meryn Cadell came out as transgender.

The program ceased to air on the full CBC network in 2005, although repeats continued to air for some further time in Nunavut to fill a scheduling hole created by time zone differences, and on Radio One&#x27;s Sirius Satellite Radio channel to fill a scheduling hole created by the satellite channel not broadcasting local programs.

<text>Melbourne Youth Justice Centre (formerly Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre and Turana Youth Training Centre) is a youth corrections facility located in Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

The facility is designed to accommodate 15- to 17-year-old males through four units and a separate multi-purpose unit that houses remand prisoners. Some inmates are slightly older if they were under 18 at the time of their offence.
Prisoners have access to a variety of social, vocational and educational programs, as well as day and weekend leaves. Prisoners also have TVs in their rooms. The facility is one of Australia&#x27;s most hazardous workplaces.

==History==
Turana 

Until the mid-1950s, Turana (then the Children&#x27;s Welfare Department Receiving Depot for Girls and Boys) &quot;processed&quot; all children from infancy to 18 coming into the care of the State Government, whether offenders or under the then equivalent of care and protection orders. Children were sent from Turana to various institutions (government and non-government) throughout the state. Children who were deemed &quot;difficult&quot; to handle or who required psychiatric treatment or were due for court appearances in Melbourne were returned to Turana.

The opening of Winlaton Youth Training Centre (also known as Winlaton Juvenile School and Nunawading Residential Facility) in 1956 meant that young women aged 14–18 were moved out of Turana. The opening in 1960 of Pirra Children&#x27;s Home (aka Pirra Girls&#x27; Home) and Allambie Reception Centre meant that young children under the care of the Family Welfare Division of the Social Welfare Department, were also moved out of Turana which could then accommodate young males only.

The name &quot;Turana&quot; was chosen in the late 1950s by the wife of Arthur Rylah, then Chief Secretary of Victoria. The word was believed to be Koori for &quot;Rainbow&quot;. Ilya Nikkolai designed and remodelled the Turana Youth Remand and Classification Centre, introducing laminated tempered glass in galvanised high-tensile steel frames, solving long-standing security and maintenance problems.

==Riots== 

(2016)
13th-14th November

The riot at the Melbourne Youth Justice Centre lasted 17 hours, ending peacefully at 6:45 pm. Over 40 inmates were involved, with property damage and fire alarms activated. Emergency services ensured no injuries, and all youths were accounted for. Following the incident, a “significant number” of inmates were temporarily transferred to an adult prison. Victorian Minister for Families and Children, Jenny Mikakos, cited infrastructure issues, pledging redevelopment for enhanced security and safety measures.

<text>Frederick Youens VC (14 August 1892 – 7 July 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was twenty four years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 13th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 July 1917 near Hill 60, Belgium, it was reported that the enemy were preparing to raid the British trenches and Second Lieutenant Youens, who had already been wounded, immediately set out to rally a Lewis gun team which had become disorganised. While doing this an enemy bomb fell on the Lewis gun position without exploding. The second lieutenant picked it up and hurled it over the parapet, but soon after another bomb fell near the same place and again he picked it up, but it exploded in his hand, severely wounding him and some of his men. The officer later succumbed to his wounds.

<text>Yeshwant Ghadge (16 November 1921 – 10 July 1944) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Details ==
He served in the 5th Mahratta Light Infantry in the British Indian Army during World War II. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1941 while a Sepoy. He had been promoted to Naik and was 22 years old when he performed the following deed for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10 July 1944 in the upper Tiber Valley, Italy, a rifle section commanded by Naik Yeshwant Ghadge came under heavy machine-gun fire at close range which killed or wounded all members of the section except the commander. Without hesitation Naik Yeshwant Ghadge rushed the machine-gun position, first throwing a grenade which knocked out the machine-gun and firer and then shooting one of the gun crew. Finally, having no time to change his magazine, he clubbed to death the two remaining members of the crew. He fell mortally wounded, shot by an enemy sniper.

The citation reads:

With no known grave, Ghadge is remembered at the Cassino Memorial.

To commemorate his sacrifice a statue is placed near the tahasil office, Mangaon in Raigad District. A memorial sundial, named the &quot;V.C. Yeshwant Ghadge Sundial Memorial&quot; was unveiled in Montone, Perugia, Italy, as a tribute to the Indian soldiers that died during the Italian Campaign.

<text>Vulture Street is the fifth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Powderfinger, released on 29 July 2003 by Universal Music. It won the 2003 ARIA Music Award for Best Rock Album. Produced by Nick DiDia, &quot;Vulture Street&quot; was certified platinum, and spent 47 weeks on the ARIA Charts and peaked at #1. Singles from the album included &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;, &quot;Love Your Way&quot; and &quot;Sunsets&quot;.

The album received nominations for ARIA Awards in five different categories in 2003, which included &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Group&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;. &quot;Vulture Street&quot; also received the award for &quot;Best Cover Art&quot;, which featured Czech supermodel Eva Herzigová.

&quot;Vulture Street&quot; was described by certain critics as &quot;a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined&quot; album. The title of the album was taken from an iconic street in the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, the city in which all Powderfinger members grew up.

== Background, recording and production ==
Following their last record, the highly successful &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;, the band agreed that they wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;. Drummer Jon Coghill told &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; &quot;we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you&#x27;re supposed to do&quot;, and guitarist Ian Haug said &quot;We all found that this is really important to us, but we wanted to make it more fun&quot;.

Powderfinger did not enter the recording studio with a specific plan on what they wanted &quot;Vulture Street&quot; to be, but that they &quot;felt that [they] wanted to write a rock album&quot;. In the end, the album became &quot;stuff that makes you want to jump around and feel good about yourself&quot;—guitarist Darren Middleton said this had not been the band&#x27;s intention. Coghill said the band wanted to make an album that was fun to perform live and listen to—most of the songs on the album were performed and released live on &quot;These Days: Live in Concert&quot;.

Like Powderfinger&#x27;s two previous albums, &quot;Vulture Street&quot; was produced by Nick DiDia. It was mixed by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who had worked with Powderfinger inspiration Neil Young. The album was recorded over a seven-week period in Sydney. Prior to recording, the band had written about 50 songs, which was trimmed to the final 11. A significant number of songs on the album were producing during jam sessions, with DiDia giving the band additional space to move in. Middleton said in an interview that the band &quot;always start things spontaneously, because that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re thinking less and just playing.&quot;

In producing &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, Powderfinger moved in a different direction to their previous works, especially &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;, starting with opening song &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rocks&quot;, which was written, according to Middleton, after &quot;a couple of months trying really hard to write this new rock album&quot; but not making anything they really liked. He also said the band could easily have written many &quot;The Metre&quot;–like songs but didn&#x27;t do that &quot;for our own interest in the band and music&quot;.

In an interview with ninemsn, lead singer Bernard Fanning said the band &quot;tapped more into that energetic rock thing and made it really different from our other albums&quot; when creating &quot;Vulture Street&quot;. He also said the band were a lot more serious when making this album, and this was partly due to &quot;the way we&#x27;ve matured as musicians&quot;.

==Album and single releases==
&quot;Vulture Street&quot; was released on 29 July 2003 in Australia, with the band launching the album at the Tivoli nightclub on 52 Costin Street Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. A special edition DVD was included with selected early copies of &quot;Vulture Street&quot;. The DVD included a documentary with all of the albums&#x27; songs and several music videos. &quot;Vulture Street&quot; entered the ARIA Charts in Australia at #1, and the RIANZ Charts in New Zealand at #17.

&quot;Vulture Street&#x27;s&quot; first single, &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, was released in June 2003. It entered the ARIA charts at #9 on 29 June 2003, and spent 13 weeks in the top 50. The song was nominated for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; at the 2003 ARIA Awards, but won neither. &quot;Love Your Way&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, and spent two weeks on the ARIA charts, entering at #37.

The third single, &quot;Sunsets&quot;, was released in January 2004. It earned the band a nomination for &quot;Best Group&quot; at the 2004 ARIA Awards, but again was unsuccessful. &quot;Sunsets&quot; charted better than most of its predecessors, reaching number 11 on the ARIA Chart, and entering the RIANZ Chart in New Zealand at number 38, the first single from &quot;Vulture Street&quot; to do so. The fourth and final single, &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;, was released in March 2004. It wasn&#x27;t as successful as its predecessors, and failed to make the ARIA top 50. &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; was written by Fanning as a tribute to his brother.

== Music and lyrics ==
The music on &quot;Vulture Street&quot; was more rock orientated than Powderfinger&#x27;s past work, especially &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;. The opening track, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rocks&quot;, was described by &quot;Harp&quot; as &quot;far too cheesy to open this record—or any record, for that matter&quot;. The song became the band&#x27;s opening track for live performances, though. The first single, &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, was one of the heavier songs on the album; varying reviewers alikened it to AC/DC, Bad Company, and Stereophonics, and musicOMH called it &quot;an unashamed full-tilt rocker&quot;. &quot;dB&quot; magazine said the title of &quot;Stumblin&#x27;&quot;, released as a single from &quot;These Days: Live in Concert&quot; after appearing on &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, was representative of the &quot;classic rock clichés&quot; on the album.

Second single &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; contained similar lyrical features to &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, but with a more mellow sound. Fanning wrote it following the death of his brother, to help deal with the event. &quot;Sunsets&quot; also dealt with this theme; Fanning told &quot;MTV Scene&quot; &quot;we write unashamedly about that emotional attachment&quot;. &quot;Love Your Way&quot; saw an acoustic opening followed by a loud chorus for which Universal Music Canada recommended the air guitar. musicOMH&#x27;s Simon Evans alikened the song to Roy Harper, while David Welsh praised the three main aspects of the song—the acoustic introduction, &quot;affected vocal delivery&quot;, and guitar solo. On live performances, Fanning plays &quot;Love Your Way&quot; with an acoustic guitar to give the loud second phase of the song more &quot;oomph&quot;.

== Reception ==

&quot;Vulture Street&quot; was generally received well by critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason MacNeil gave the album four stars, stating the opening notes of the album had a &quot;great rock flavor to them&quot;. He described &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot; as reminiscent of &quot;Stereophonics rehashing old-school rock for a contemporary feeling&quot;, and said &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; was an &quot;uplifting gospel-tinged effort&quot;. MacNeil&#x27;s main criticism was for &quot;Roll Right By You&quot;, a song he described as &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot;. However, MacNeil said that overall the album was &quot;an outstanding piece of work&quot;.

&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s&quot; Bernard Zuel approved of the album, giving it four stars, and calling &quot;Vulture Street&quot; a &quot;rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album&quot;. He said that throughout the album, guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug &quot;dominated in a way they haven&#x27;t since their 1994 debut, &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;&quot;. Zuel drew several connections to Powderfinger&#x27;s early work, but noted &quot;a superior intellect&quot; in this album. Zuel summarised by saying it was easy to &quot;just enjoy Vulture Street&#x27;s power and passion. And the rock.&quot;

Ty Burr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewed the album positively, writing of a return to Powderfinger&#x27;s &quot;bar-band roots&quot;, while still featuring some &quot;sharp pop hooks under the riffs&quot;. He drew references to early Radiohead and Bad Company, whom he argued Fanning was inspired by on &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;. The review was summarised by Burr describing &quot;Vulture Street&quot; as &quot;good company&quot;.

&quot;MusicOMH&quot; reviewer Simon Evans said Powderfinger added &quot;a real punch to songs...far removed from your standard rock and roll fare&quot; in &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, praising the emotion and seriousness of &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; and &quot;How Far Have We Really Come?&quot;, and the &quot;fun&quot; in &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;. Evans praised producer Nick DiDia for his work on the album, which he summarised as &quot;a quantum leap from its rather passionless predecessor, &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Vulture Street&quot; received numerous nominations for ARIA Music Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2003 and 2004. To date, the album has received eight nominations in six categories, four of which they had won the award for.

<text>Major Charles Allix Lavington Yate, VC (14 March 1872 – 20 September 1914) was an English British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Yate, from Madeley, Shropshire, attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and joined the British Army. He saw service in British India, Mauritius, South Africa during the Second Boer War, as an observer during the Russo-Japanese War, and between 1908 and 1914 he was on the staff of the War Office in London.

==Early life==
Yate was born in his mother&#x27;s home town of Ludwigslust on 14 March 1872 to the Reverend Prebendary George Edward Yate (1825–1908), vicar of St Michael&#x27;s Church, Madeley from 1859 to 1908, and his German second wife Luise Caroline Georgine Adolphine Henriette, née Petersen. His cousin was Sir Charles Yate, 1st Baronet.

He was educated at Weymouth College, and graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, 9th out of 1,100 cadets. He joined the 2nd Battalion, the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry as a second lieutenant on 13 August 1892, while it was stationed in Bombay. Promoted to lieutenant on 7 January 1894, he first saw action in India in the Tirah expedition from 1897 to 1898, for which he was awarded the medal and clasp of the Tirah Expedition. He was promoted to captain on 26 July 1899, and with his battalion was transferred to South Africa following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October that year. The battalion took part in the battles of Belmont and Enslin in November 1899, where Yate was seriously wounded. After the war ended in June 1902, he was briefly a staff officer for requisitions from September 1902, then transferred with the battalion to Malta, leaving Point Natal on the SS &quot;Staffordshire&quot; in October.

In late 1903, he was seconded as an observer in the Japanese Army, and stayed there during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Between 1908 and 1914 he was on the staff of the War Office in London. He was promoted to the rank of major in 1912.

Yate was fluent in French, German and Japanese, and could also speak Hindustani and Persian.

==VC action==
Yate was 42 years old, and a major in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, during the First World War when the following deed took place during the battle of Le Cateau for which he was awarded the VC.

On 26 August 1914 at Le Cateau, France, Major Yate commanded one of the two companies that remained to the end in the trenches, and when all other officers had been killed or wounded and ammunition exhausted, he led his 19 survivors against the enemy in a charge.

He was captured by the Germans and interned in Targau prisoner of war camp. After repeated attempts, he escaped a month later on 19 September 1914, but was quickly apprehended by local factory workers who suspected his appearance, and cut his own throat to avoid recapture and possible execution as a spy. He died on 20 September 1914.

Four other VCs were won that day at Le Cateau, including one by Lance Corporal Frederick William Holmes, who wrote of Yate: &quot;Major Yate was a thorough gentleman and a great favourite with us all. He had had a lot of experience in the Far East and at home, and I am sure that if he had lived he would have become a general. He was always in front, and his constant cry was &quot;Follow me!&quot;&quot;

Yate is buried in grave II. G. 8. at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Berlin South-Western Cemetery in Stahnsdorf, near Potsdam, Germany. He is also listed on the parish war memorial, now on The Green, at Madeley, and within St Michael&#x27;s Church, Madeley.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry Museum in the Doncaster Museum, England.

==Family==
On 17 September 1903 he married at St George&#x27;s Church, Hanover Square, London, Florence Helena Brigg, from Greenhead Hall, Yorkshire. There were no children.

<text>Colonel Richard Wadeson VC (31 July 1826 – 24 January 1885) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Wadeson was born at Bay Horse, near Lancaster, Lancashire, England on 31 July 1826. The son of a blacksmith, he became a tallow chandler’s apprentice before enlisting in the 75th Regiment of Foot (later the Gordon Highlanders) in November 1843, aged 17. After promotions to corporal and sergeant, the regiment travelled to India in 1849, where Wadeson was appointed the regiment&#x27;s sergeant major in February 1854.

Wadeson was commissioned ensign in the 75th regiment in June 1857 and lieutenant in September 1857. Meanwhile, the Indian Mutiny had broken out, and the 75th were ordered to Delhi, then held by mutineers, they participating in the Battle of Badli-ki-Serai on 8 June as they advanced.

==Victoria Cross==
Wadeson was 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the 75th Regiment, British Army, during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 18 July 1857 at Siege of Delhi, for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later career==
After the mutiny campaign, Wadeson served as adjutant of the 75th Regiment until December 1864 when – still with the regiment – he was promoted to captain in December 1864 and major in July 1872. In December 1875 he was made a lieutenant-colonel and appointed to the command of the 75th, becoming only the third regimental commander in the British Army to start his military career in the ranks. After promotion to brevet colonel in December 1880, he became Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in March 1881, where he died in office on 24 January 1885 aged 58. He was buried with military honours at Brompton Cemetery, attended by many Chelsea Pensioners. There is a commemorative plaque to him at the Royal Hospital.

After the death of his first wife, Wadeson married Susan Lear in April 1857. They had two daughters, and a son who served in the 37th Lancers, Indian Army.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.

<text>Nowell Rhys Fulber (born October 10, 1970) is a Canadian electronic musician and producer. He is a member of Front Line Assembly and Delerium, along with Bill Leeb. He also records under his own name and under the name Conjure One.
== Biography ==
Fulber was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on October 10, 1970. His father, a musician, was born in Germany and his mother was from Great Britain. His father introduced him to the music of Led Zeppelin and Kraftwerk; they both attended a Kraftwerk concert in 1975. Fulber became interested in music and started drumming on his father&#x27;s instruments at a very early age. Along with Kraftwerk, Fulber&#x27;s electronic influences included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Jean-Michel Jarre, SPK, and Pete Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Homosapien&quot; (1981). He has cited OMD as his favourite band in his youth.

His father later built and ran a recording studio, catering toward the local punk rock scene. As a youth, Fulber spent a lot of time at the studio. In 1984 he started becoming more interested in electronic music and acquired his first synthesizer.

In 1986, he became friends with Bill Leeb, who had just left his former band Skinny Puppy. 

Fulber is a first cousin of Shawn Atleo (Ahousaht First Nation), a Canadian activist and politician, who was elected twice as national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, serving 2009 into 2014.

== Early music career ==
Fulber&#x27;s first involvements in Front Line Assembly were one song on their second cassette release &quot;Total Terror&quot;, and then three songs on &quot;The Initial Command&quot;. He also contributed to Delerium&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Faces, Forms &amp; Illusions&quot;. During this time he started the band Will together with Chris Peterson, John McRae and Jeff Stoddard, which lasted from 1987 to 1992.

He joined Front Line Assembly for their first tour, Gashed Senses &amp; Crossfire in 1989. He then joined Delerium full-time when Michael Balch left. Until 1997, Fulber was involved in all Front Line Assembly, Delerium and side projects with Bill Leeb, including the albums &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; and &quot;Hard Wired&quot; from Front Line Assembly, and &quot;Semantic Spaces&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot; from Delerium.

Leeb and Fulber released several albums as Synæsthesia, including &quot;Embody&quot;, &quot;Desideratum&quot; and &quot;Ephemeral&quot;.

Fulber was nominated for the Jack Richardson Producer Of The Year award at the 2008 Juno Awards and won two Junos with Delerium for Best Dance Recording in 1998 and 2000.

== Production ==
As Front Line Assembly was beginning to peak, their UK label Third Mind was bought out by Roadrunner Records, a predominantly metal label. An up-and-coming band on the label Fear Factory was looking to expand their sound with remixes and new label mates Front Line Assembly were contacted. This led to the influential Fear Is the Mindkiller EP. From this more metal themed work followed while Fulber was contracted to contribute keyboards and de facto additional production to Fear Factory&#x27;s breakthrough Demanufacture album, defining their signature sound. Fulber had also contributed backing tracks around this same time to new Canadian industrial rock band Econoline Crush, leading to their signing with EMI Canada and eventually his first full length production job handling their debut album Affliction, spawning minor Canadian rock radio hit &quot;Wicked&quot;. From there his production career grew and became more varied. The later success of Delerium bringing him into more adult music formats with artists like Josh Groban and Serena Ryder. Based out of Los Angeles since 2000, he currently works out of his own studio, Surplus Sound in Van Nuys.

<text>The eleventh edition of the South American Championship was held in Lima, Peru from 30 October to 27 November 1927. The participating countries were Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay. Brazil, Chile and Paraguay withdrew from the tournament. This was the first South American Championship in which Peru participated. The tournament was also used as a qualifier for the 1928 Summer Olympics and both Argentina and Uruguay were subsequently invited to enter that competition.

The Argentina team departed from Retiro railway station to Chilean city Valparaíso, where they joined Uruguayan players to board a ship to the port of Callao, Lima. They arrived in Peru after eight days.

<text>Richard William Leslie Wain VC (5 December 1896 – 20 November 1917) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Wain was born in Penarth near Cardiff, Wales to Florence E. Wain and Harris Wain. He was educated at The Cathedral School, Llandaff and then at Penarth Grammar School and St Bees Grammar School, where he was a member of the Officers Training Corps. On the outbreak of the Great War, despite having won a scholarship to attend Oxford University, he joined the Territorial Army. He was commissioned into the Manchester Regiment on 16 July 1915 and served in France.

He was wounded on 1 July 1916 on the opening day of the battle of the Somme. He was serving as an officer of 17th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment; his unit suffering severe casualties as they successfully captured the village of Montauban. Wain served in A Company and was badly wounded as he led his men forward. He joined the Heavy Section of the Machine Gun Corps and was allocated to A Battalion. His unit, which was equipped with tanks, took part in the Battle of Messines in June 1917; Wain&#x27;s tank reaching its final objective and destroying a number of German machine guns which were in a concrete emplacement.

He was 20 years old, and a section commander and acting captain in A Battalion, Tank Corps, when he was posthumously awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions on 20 November 1917 at Marcoing, near Cambrai, France, during the battle of Cambrai (1917). His tank took a direct hit killing all but him and one member of his crew. Though severely wounded he rushed an enemy strong point with a Lewis gun capturing it and taking about half the garrison prisoners. His actions allowed the infantry, which had been pinned back by the machine gun post, to advance. He was killed shortly afterwards while continuing to fire on the retiring enemy.

===Memorials===
Wain has no known grave. He is commemorated at the Cambrai Memorial to the Missing and on the war memorials at Llandaff Cathedral and in the chapel at St Bees School.

<doc id="1186676" wikidata="Q1723089" url="?curid=1186676" title="Kaminsky catalyst">
<text>A Kaminsky catalyst is a catalytic system for alkene polymerization. Kaminsky catalysts are based on metallocenes of group 4 transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf) activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). These and other innovations have inspired development of new classes of catalysts that in turn led to commercialization of novel engineering polyolefins.

==Catalyst development==
The catalyst is named after German chemist Walter Kaminsky, who first described it in 1980 along with Hansjörg Sinn and others. Prior to Kaminsky&#x27;s work, titanium chlorides supported on various materials were widely used (and still are) as heterogeneous catalysts for alkene polymerization. These halides are typically activated by treatment with trimethylaluminium. Kaminsky discovered that titanocene and related complexes emulated some aspects of these Ziegler–Natta catalysts but with low activity. He subsequently found that high activity could be achieved upon activation of these metallocenes with methylaluminoxane (MAO). The MAO serves two roles: (i) alkylation of the metallocene halide and (ii) abstraction of an anionic ligand (chloride or methyl) to give an electrophilic catalyst with a labile coordination site.

==Ligand design==
Kaminsky&#x27;s discovery of well-defined, high activity homogeneous catalysts led to many innovations in the design of novel cyclopentadienyl ligands. These innovations include ansa-metallocenes, Cs-symmetric fluorenyl-Cp ligands, constrained geometry catalysts, Some Kaminsky-inspired catalysts use of chiral metallocenes that have bridged cyclopentadienyl rings. These innovations made possible highly stereoselective (or stereoregular) polymerization of α-olefins, some of which have been commercialized.

<doc id="1186677" wikidata="Q2312102" url="?curid=1186677" title="Ground-level power supply">
<text>Ground-level power supply, also known as surface current collection or, in French, alimentation par le sol (&quot;feeding via the ground&quot;), is a concept and group of technologies that enable electric vehicles to collect electric power at ground level instead of the more common overhead lines. 

Ground-level power supply systems date to the beginning of electric tramways. Often they were implemented where the public expressed an aesthetic desire to avoid overhead lines. Some of the earliest systems used conduit current collection. Systems in the 21st century, such as Alstom APS, Ansaldo Tramwave, CAF ACR, and Elways, were developed to modern standards of safety and reliability, and added the ability to supply power to electric buses, trucks, and cars. 

Some ground-level power supply systems use efficient, energy-dense capacitors and batteries to power portions of an electric transit system—for example, enabling buses and trains to charge their batteries during station stops.

==Early systems==
Conduit current collection systems were implemented as early as 1881 with the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway. The system is primarily composed of a channel, or conduit, excavated under the roadway; the conduit is positioned either between the running rails, much in the same fashion as the cable for cable cars, or underneath one of the rails; a car is connected to a &quot;plow&quot; that runs through the conduit and delivers power from two electric rails at the sides of the conduit to the car&#x27;s electric motor. Plows were manually attached and detached from cars as they switched rail lines.

Cleveland opened a conduit line in 1885. Tram companies in Budapest trialed a conduit current collector system in 1887. Overhead lines were met with public opposition for aesthetic reasons, so the contractor Siemens-Halske implemented a concrete conduit underneath one of the trolley rails, with a narrow opening that allowed a &quot;plow&quot; to be inserted and make electrical contact with wires held by insulators at either side of the conduit. The system was used in several cities in Europe and the United States, where it was known as the &quot;Budapest System&quot;. Washington, D.C. installed its first conduit current collection system in 1895. By 1899 all downtown lines were converted to the conduit system, which remained in operation until 1962. The system was generally safe, but tended to get clogged by mud and dirt. The system fell out of favor within a few years due to the cost of excavating the conduit, and was generally replaced with overhead lines.

Stud contact systems were implemented from 1899 to 1921. Systems by the inventors Dolter and Diatto were used in Tours, Paris, and several towns in England. Power was supplied from studs set in the road at intervals, which connected to the traveling cars with contact shoes or contact skis. The studs were cylinders with their tops flush with the road surface. Underneath there was a switch mechanism that made an electrical connection with the top of the stud when a car with a strong electromagnet at its underside passed over it. The Diatto switches contained mercury, which often leaked or adhered to the side of the cylinder and kept the exposed top electrified. The Dolter switches used pivot arms, which tended to get stuck in the electrified position. Similar systems were operated by Thomson-Houston in Monaco from 1898 to 1903, and by František Křižík in Prague on the King Charles Bridge from 1903 to 1908. Stud contact systems were short-lived due to safety issues.

Conduit current collection systems were used in several major cities, including Monaco, Dresden, Prague, Tours, Washington, and London, but posed maintenance issues and road safety issues. The Bordeaux and Washington conduit systems remained the last in operation until being decommissioned in 1958 and 1962, respectively. For decades, these systems were not reintroduced because they didn&#x27;t meet modern safety standards.

==Modern systems==

A number of ground-level power supply systems were developed from the 1970s through the 1990s, but were not reliable or safe enough for commercial use. 

The first ground-level power supply system developed to modern safety standards was the Ansaldo Stream, although a competing system, Alstom APS, was the first to be commercially implemented in 2003. This success led to a proliferation of commercial implementations of ground-level power supply systems. 

Advancements in technology in the late 2010s led to ground-level power supplies seeing increasing reliability and economic feasibility.

===Electric road systems===
==== Sweden ====
Electric roads power and charge electric vehicles while driving. Sweden has tested electric road systems that charge the batteries of trucks and electric cars, and among the tested systems are two ground-level power supply systems tested since 2017, in-road rail by Elways-Evias and on-road rail by Elonroad. Elonroad later developed an in-road rail system for highway use at speeds up to . The systems were found to be more economical than the tested overhead line system and dynamic inductive charging system. The in-road rail system is planned to deliver up to 800 kW per vehicle traveling over a powered segment of the rail, and the system is estimated to be the most cost-effective among the four tested systems. The new systems are expected to be safe, with segments of the rail being powered only when a vehicle is traveling over them. The rails have been tested while submerged in salt water and were found to be safe for pedestrians.

==== France ====

The co-director for one of the French Ministry of Ecology working groups on electric road systems stated that rail-based ERS are the most advantageous, though the specific rail technology has yet to be standardized. France plans to invest 30 to 40 billion euro by 2035 in an electric road system spanning 8,800 kilometers. Ground-level power supply technologies are considered the most likely candidates for electric roads. Two projects for assessment of electric road technologies have been announced in 2023. The first French public road with an electric road system is planned to open in 2024 using a ground-level power supply system derived from Alstom APS. The second, with technology developed by Elonroad, is scheduled to undergo laboratory testing for skid effects on motorcycles before being deployed along two kilometers on the A10 autoroute south of Paris.

===Standardization===
Alstom, Elonroad, and other companies have, in 2020, begun drafting a standard for ground-level power supply electric roads. The European Commission published in 2021 a request for regulation and standardization of electric road systems. Shortly afterward, a working group of the French Ministry of Ecology recommended adopting a European electric road standard formulated with Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and others.

The first standard for electrical equipment on board a vehicle powered by a rail electric road system (ERS) has been published in late 2022. The standard, CENELEC Technical Standard 50717, specifies the following: an ERS voltage of 750 volts; a contact shoe capable of withstanding impact of gravel and similar road debris at the maximum operating speed; a weak link that breaks off the current collector at the structural fixing points if the force is larger than the maximum specified by the vehicle manufacturer; automatic monitoring of the presence of ERS infrastructure; automatic engagement and disengagement; a presence signal that may be analog or digital, and optional standard bidirectional communication; ease of inspection and replacement for the wearing parts of the sliding contact; and standard tests, markings, maintenance, and operational environment conditions. The 50717 standard does not encompass, but specifies for normative purposes, three architectures for ERS infrastructure: Type A architecture with two parallel surface-level conductive rails, one positive and one negative; Type B architecture with a single surface-level or raised track with short segments where each two segments in series consist of one positive and one negative segment; and Type C architecture with three parallel conductive rails, one positive and one negative below surface level in 1.5 cm wide channels, and one or more rails earthed at surface level.

Following standards, encompassing &quot;full interoperability&quot; and a &quot;unified and interoperable solution&quot; for ground-level power supply, are scheduled to be published by the end 2024, detailing complete &quot;specifications for communication and power supply through conductive rails embedded in the road&quot; as specified in the proposed technical standard prTS 50740 in accordance with European Union directive 2023/1804.

==Modern implementations==
===Ansaldo Stream===
The first modern ground-level power supply system to be developed is the Ansaldo Stream system. STREAM is an acronym that stands for &quot;Sistema di TRasporto Elettrico ad Attrazione Magnetica&quot;, meaning &quot;System of Electric Transport by Magnetic Attraction&quot;. The system uses a channel in the road made of insulating composite fiberglass material which contains a flexible copper strip; a vehicle passing over the channel with a special magnetic contact shoe raises the conductor to the surface, allowing power to flow to the vehicle. Segments of the strip are powered only when a vehicle passes over them. The system was developed in 1994 and trialed on a public tram line in 1998, which was eventually dismantled in 2012.

===Alstom APS===

Alstom APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into 11-metre segments. These segments automatically switch on by radio control only when a tram is passing over them, thereby eradicating any risk to other road users. The tram has two collector shoes, and two segments of rail are active at any given time, to avoid interruption of power when passing between segments. APS was developed by Innorail, a subsidiary of Spie Enertrans but was sold to Alstom when Spie was acquired by Amec. It was originally created for the Bordeaux tramway, which started construction in 2000 and opened in 2003, becoming the first modern commercial ground-level power supply system. From 2011, the technology has been used in a number of other cities around the world.

The French government reports no electrocutions or electrification accidents on any tramway in France from as early as 2003 until as recently as December 31, 2022.

Alstom further developed the APS system for use with buses and other vehicles. The system has been tested for safety when the road is cleared by snowplows, under exposure to snow, ice, salting, and saturated brine, and for skid and road adherence safety for vehicles, including motorcycles. Alstom will trial its electric road system (ERS) on the public road RN205 in the Rhône-Alpes region between 2024 and 2027. The system is expected to supply 500kW of power for electric heavy trucks, as well as power for road utility vehicles and electric cars.

===CAF ACR===

Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) trialed its Acumulador de Carga Rápida (ACR) system in 2007 in Seville. The system is capable of charging from strips on the ground or from overhead wires. Sections of the Seville MetroCentro tramway around the Seville Cathedral were converted to the ACR ground-level power supply system. ACR&#x27;s first commercial installation was aboard Urbos trams supplied to MetroCentro in 2011, allowing the permanent removal of overhead lines around the cathedral.

Line 1 of the Tranvía de Zaragoza has also used ACR since its second construction phase was completed in 2013. The use of ACR avoided the installation of overhead lines in the city&#x27;s historic centre.

ACR was included in the Newcastle Light Rail in Australia and Luxembourg&#x27;s new tram system.

===Ansaldo Tramwave===
Derived from Ansaldo Stream and developed by Italian company Ansaldo STS (which later became Hitachi Rail STS), the Ansaldo TramWave ground-level power supply system successfully entered commercial application in 2017, with the opening of Zhuhai tram Line 1 first phase in China. The tram is the first fully low-floor tram system adopting ground level power supply technology. Later in 2017, Western Suburb Line in Beijing was opened with the same technology from Ansaldo. The technology has been licensed to CRRC Dalian and all the technologies were transferred to China.
In 2019, Zhuhai City evaluated whether to dismantle the tram line, after 3 years of operation. As of 2024, CRRC Dalian opposes dismantling, proposing to restart operation.

<text>Major Richard Wakeford VC (23 July 1921 – 27 August 1972) was an English soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Richard Wakeford (1921-1972) was born in Kensington, London on 23 July 1921, the son of Dr. Victor David Collins Wakeford and Mary (née Kee), and was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Oxford. In 1939, he began a course in medicine at Oxford University, intending to become a surgeon and follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Unfortunately, World War II curtailed his medical studies, and ultimately his choice of career. He was commissioned into the Army in 1941.

Richard Wakeford was 22 years old, and a temporary captain in the 2/4th Battalion, The Hampshire Regiment of the British Army, during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 May 1944, near Cassino, Italy, Captain Wakeford, accompanied by his orderly and armed only with a revolver, went forward and killed a number of men from the German 1st Parachute Division and took 20 prisoners. When attacking a hill feature the following day his company came under heavy fire, although wounded in the face and both arms, Captain Wakeford pressed home the attack. He was wounded again, but reached the objective and consolidated the position.

==Further information==
After the war, he returned to Trinity College, Oxford. He stroked the Trinity 1st VIII to the Head of the River in the 1946 Summer Eights. He was invalided out of the army with the rank of major that same year.

On 31 March 1951, he married Denise Elizabeth Corlson at St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Westcliff on Sea, Essex. Mrs. Denise Wakeford died on 2 February 2019, aged 96.).

He qualified as a solicitor and in 1964 was appointed as a Chancery Master.

Richard Wakeford died at Leatherhead, Surrey, in 1972 aged 51 and was cremated at Leatherhead Randalls Park Crematorium.
The Haberdashers&#x27; Company, of which he was a Warden, held a memorial service for him on 26 September 1972 at St Lawrence Jewry.

His VC is held by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers in London.

A memorial plaque in honour of Major Richard Wakeford VC and Mrs. Denise Elizabeth Wakeford was erected at Leatherhead Randalls Park Crematorium, Surrey, England in 2019.

<text>General Sir Mark Walker (24 November 1827 – 18 July 1902) was a British Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Walker was born in Gore Port, Finea, County Westmeath in Ireland, the son of Captain Alexander Walker and Elizabeth Elliott. His younger brother was Sir Samuel Walker, 1st Baronet QC, Liberal MP for Londonderry, Solicitor-General for Ireland, Attorney-General for Ireland and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

==Victoria Cross==

During the Crimean War, Walker was a 26-year-old lieutenant in the 30th Regiment of Foot (later the East Lancashire Regiment) British Army when the deed for which he was awarded the VC was performed.

His Victoria Cross was until recently on display at The Buffs Regimental Museum, Canterbury, England. With the rest of that museum&#x27;s collections, it has now been transferred to the National Army Museum, where it is not currently on display.

==Later life==
He was wounded by a howitzer shell during his service in the Crimea which resulted in the amputation of his right arm. He served through the Second Anglo-Chinese War of 1860 as brigade major, and in 1861 he received the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Promotion to colonel followed in 1869, and from 1875 to 1879 he commanded a brigade in Madras, during which he was promoted to major-general in 1878. From 1883 to 1884 he was at Aldershot, then in command of a brigade at Gibraltar until 1888, when he was promoted lieutenant-general. He retired from the army with the rank of general in 1893, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

From 1900 until his death he was colonel of the Sherwood Foresters.

He died at Arlington, Devon, England on 18 July 1902.

A memorial wall plaque honouring Sir Mark is found at Canterbury Cathedral.

==Personal life==
In 1881 Walker married Catherine Chichester.

<text>Major General William George Walker, (28 May 1863 – 16 February 1936) was a senior British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Early career==
Walker was born at Nainital, India, on 28 May 1863, the son of Deputy Surgeon General William Walker, Indian Medical Service. He was commissioned in the Suffolk Regiment in August 1885, seconded to the Indian Staff Corps in May 1887, and promoted to captain in 1896. In India, Walker served on the North-West Frontier, including campaigns in Samana, 1891 and Waziristan, 1894–95. In 1903–04 he served in Somaliland.

==VC action==
Walker was 39 years old, and a captain in the 4th Gurkha Rifles, Indian Army, attached to the Bikanir Camel Corps during the Third Somaliland Expedition when he won the VC. On 22 April 1903 after the action at Daratoleh, British Somaliland, the rearguard got considerably behind the rest of the column. Captain Walker and Captain George Murray Rolland, with four other men, were with a fellow officer when he fell badly wounded, and while one went for assistance, Captain Walker and the rest stayed with him, endeavouring to keep off the enemy. This they succeeded in doing, and when the officer in command of the column, Major John Edmund Gough, arrived, they managed to get the wounded man on to a camel. He was, however, hit a second time and died immediately. Rolland and Gough also received the VC for this action.

==Later life==
Walker returned to India, and served as commandant of the 1st Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles, becoming a brevet lieutenant colonel in September 1904, a colonel in January 1911, and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1914.

Walker served in the First World War as commander of the 9th Sirhind Brigade from August 1914 and achieved the temporary rank of major general in 1915, which in 1916 became permanent, as general officer commanding (GOC) 2nd Division.

Walker died at the age of 72 on 16 February 1936 in Seaford, East Sussex, and was cremated at the Woodvale Crematorium in Brighton and is commemorated there.

His VC is displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<text>Alternity is a science fiction role-playing game (RPG) published by TSR in 1997. Following the acquisition of TSR by Wizards of the Coast, the game was discontinued in 2000 as part of a broader rationalisation of TSR&#x27;s business holdings, but it retains a small and devoted fanbase. Parts of &quot;Alternity&quot; as well as TSR&#x27;s classic &quot;Star Frontiers&quot; game were later incorporated into the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; game, especially the &quot;d20 Future&quot; setting. &quot;Star*Drive&quot; was the first campaign setting published for &quot;Alternity&quot;, and was introduced in 1998.

A new game called &quot;Alternity&quot; was crowdfunded on Kickstarter in June 2017 by Sasquatch Game Studio and was successful and on August 1st, 2018 the Core Rulebook was released to the public.

==System==
Characters were created with a point-based system, and could be either humans, mutants, one of several alien species presented in the core books, or original aliens created by the GM. Classes were replaced by professions, which dictated what skills and abilities were cheaper for any given hero to get, though a few skills (in particular, psionics) were restricted to specific professions.

Skills are classified into broad and speciality skills. Earning a specialty skill requires an associated broad skill, which requires a character to have sufficient associated ability points. Special skill is further classified into ranks, which affects the skill&#x27;s scores. Skill scores are presented with the full score, half that score, and one-quarter that score. which represent the numbers needed to achieve Ordinary, Good, or Amazing successes in an action round respectively.

Unlike many other systems, actions are determined by a control die and situation
dice. When Gamemaster calls for a roll, player rolls 1 control die and 1 situation die. The control die is always a 20-sided die, while situation die can be a 0-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 12-, 20-sided die, where 0-sided die means the action only depends on control die roll. Situation die can be plus die or a minus die, in which the value in the situation die is added to or subtracted from control die value. The total of the rolled numbers is checked against character&#x27;s action, skill, feat, to indicate a success or a failure. Rolling low is always better for successfully completing an action.

The type of situation die being used depends on the difficulty of the action. Difficulty is scaled in die types of -d20, -d12, -d8, -d6, -d4, +d0, +d4, +d6, +d8, +d12, +d20, +2d20, +3d20. A character&#x27;s base situation die is +d4 for broad skill or feat check, +d0 for specialty skill or action check. A minus situation bonus means player uses a larger negative situation die set, while a plus situation penalty means a player uses a larger positive situation die set.

In an action round, a round is divided into four phases. Each phase relates to one of the degrees of success that are achievable on an action check: Amazing, Good, Ordinary, and Marginal, in order from the first phase to the last. A hero can attempt only one action per phase. Acting orders of characters are determined by a d20 die roll for all participants, which determines the earliest phase in which a character can act. All actions in a phase are considered to occur simultaneously, with the results of those actions being applied at the end of the phase. A character can act in as many phases as it has actions per round.

Depending on how far below the skill score the player rolled, there are 3 progressively better layers of success and 2 levels of failure. An action is determined using this same system, making the game very uniform. Only armor rolls and damage rolls did not use the d20.

Life points, called &#x27;Durability&#x27;, are categorized into Stun, Wound, and Mortal damage. Stun damage can immobilize a character, but are not life-threatening. They are restored at the end of a scene. Wound damage can immobilize a character and inflicts 1 stun damage point for every 2 wound damage points received. It can be recovered by resting. Mortal damage can kill a character, and inflicts 1 wound damage point for every 2 mortal damage points received. It can be restored by use of the &quot;Medical Science–surgery&quot; skill. Durabilities can also be repaired by healing.

It was designed to be a generic rule set around which a campaign world could be built. It was not very heavily marketed and suffered from mediocre sales. Increased focus on the d20 system led to the discontinuation of the game in 2000.

Much of the content of the &quot;Alternity&quot; game has been absorbed into the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; role-playing game. The &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; campaign is an entire &quot;d20 Modern&quot; expansion and &quot;Star*Drive&quot; is part of the &quot;d20 Future&quot; expansion. The &quot;Gamma World&quot; campaign is an &quot;d20 Modern&quot; expansion by Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios (White Wolf).

===Dice mechanics===
&quot;Alternity&quot; uses four, six, eight, twelve, and twenty-sided dice.

The probability curve created by the addition or subtraction of a d20 and another die is shaped like a plateau, with two straight lines on both ends of the flat region. This is intermediate between the totally flat probability curve rolled by rolling a 20-sided die and the bell-shaped curve produced by die pool systems.

==Published products==
Several books were published under the &quot;Alternity&quot; banner as core products, accessories, or under specific campaign settings.

===Core products===
These products presented the basic rules and information about the &quot;Alternity&quot; system.
* Introductory Box Set – A box set including all the basic information for players and gamemasters to learn the &quot;Alternity&quot; rules.
* Player&#x27;s Handbook – Included all the rules for players and player characters. Required to play.
* Gamemaster Guide – Included all the rules for gamemasters and session preparation. Required to play.
* Fast Play – An abbreviated form of the rules to ease players into the game.
* Campaign Kit – The kit included a gamemaster&#x27;s screen and a booklet of record keeping forms.

===Accessories===
These products were not tied to any of the official campaign settings but could be used with them.
* Beyond Science: A Guide to FX – An exploration and reworking of the FX abilities (a sci-fi version of magic) in the corebook.
* Dataware – The guide to computers, hacking, and robotics.
* Mindwalking – The guide to psionics including revisions to the rules from the corebook.
* Starships – The guide to interstellar ships and travel.
* Tangents – This book explored the concept of parallel realities in the same vein as the 90s television show Sliders.

===Campaign settings===
In addition to the general &quot;Alternity&quot; line of products, four campaign settings were published, each with their own books:
* &quot;Star*Drive&quot; – A space opera setting.
* &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; – A setting similar to The X-Files television show.
* &quot;Gamma World&quot; – An update to the classic post-apocalyptic game setting.
* &quot;StarCraft Adventures&quot; – Based on the popular computer strategy game by Blizzard Entertainment. This setting used simplified &quot;fast play&quot; rules rather than the full &quot;Alternity&quot; rule set.

<doc id="1186696" wikidata="Q666999" url="?curid=1186696" title="Kreuzeck group">
<text>The Kreuzeck Group is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps. It may be considered either a separate range or part of the larger High Tauern chain. Administratively, the range belongs to the Austrian states of Carinthia and, in the westernmost part, Tyrol (i.e. East Tyrol).

==Geography==

The Kreuzeck Group is geographically separated from the main chain of the High Tauern in the north by the Möll, a left tributary of the Drava, up to the confluence within the Lurnfeld basin in the east. In the south, the Drava forms the border with the Gailtal Alps, part of the Southern Limestone Alps. The Iselsberg Pass near Lienz, connecting the Drava and Möll valleys, marks the western end.

The range is mainly composed of gneiss and garnet-mica-schists. The mountainous area (approximately 450 km2) is sparsely populated and used mainly for forestry and hunting. However, its tourism industry has improved in recent years. The area of the Reißeck municipality in the Möll valley is the site of the &quot;Reißeck-Kreuzeck&quot; hydroelectric power plant run by the Austrian Verbund company, whereby water is collected in several reservoirs in the Kreuzeck range.

Though named after Mt. Kreuzeck (), the highest peaks of the range are the Mölltaler Polinik (), Striedenkopf (), and Hochkreuz ().

==Classification==
According to the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps, the Kreuzeck group (AVE 43) together with the Rieserferner group, the Villgraten Mountains (&quot;Defereggen&quot;) and the Schober group forms the southern front of the High Tauern ranges, a section of the Alpine divide.

According to the 2005 SOIUSA (&quot;International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps&quot;) proposal, the Kreuzeck group (II/A-17.IV.) is a subsection of the Western Tauern Alps.

<text>GxP is a general abbreviation for the &quot;good practice&quot; quality guidelines and regulations. The &quot;x&quot; stands for the various fields, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, for example good agricultural practice, or GAP.

A &quot;c&quot; or &quot;C&quot; is sometimes added to the front of the initialism. The preceding &quot;c&quot; stands for &quot;current.&quot; For example, cGMP is an abbreviation for &quot;current good manufacturing practice&quot;. The term GxP is frequently used to refer in a general way to a collection of quality guidelines.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the GxP quality guidelines is to ensure a product is safe and meets its intended use. GxP guides quality manufacture in regulated industries including food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics.

The most central aspects of GxP are Good Documentation Practices (GDP), which are expected to be ALCOA:
* Attributable: documents are attributable to an individual
* Legible: they are readable
* Contemporaneously Recorded: not dated in the past or the future, but when the documented task is completed
* Original or a True Copy
* Accurate: accurately reflecting the activity documented
* and Permanent,

The products that are the subject of the GxP are expected to be
* Traceability: the ability to reconstruct the development history of a drug or medical device.
* Accountability: the ability to resolve who has contributed what to the development and when.

GxPs require that a Quality System be established, implemented, documented, and maintained.

As explained above, documentation is a critical tool for ensuring GxP adherence. For more information, see good manufacturing practice.

== Examples of GxPs ==
* Good agricultural and collection practices, or GACP(s)
* Good agricultural practice, or GAP
* Good auditing practice, or GAP
* Good automated laboratory practice, or GALP
* Good automated manufacturing practice, or GAMP
* Good business practice, or GBP
* Good cell culture practice, or GCCP
* Good clinical data management practice, or GCDMP
* Good clinical laboratory practice, or GCLP
* Good clinical practice, or GCP
* Good documentation practice, or GDP, or GDocP (to distinguish from &quot;good distribution practice&quot;)
* Good distribution practice, or GDP
* Good engineering practice, or GEP
* Good financial practice, or GFP
* Good guidance practice, or GGP
* Good hygiene practice, or GHP
* Good hygiene practice, or GHP
* Good laboratory practice, or GLP
* Good machine learning practice, or GMLP
* Good management practice, or GMP
* Good manufacturing practice, or GMP
* Good microbiological practice, or GMiP
* Good participatory practice, or GPP
* Good pharmacovigilance practice, or GPvP or even GVP
* Good pharmacy practice, or GPP
* Good policing practice, or GPP
* Good recruitment practice, or GRP
* Good research practice, or GRP
* Good safety practice, or GSP
* Good storage practice, or GSP

<text>Samuel Thomas Dickson Wallace VC (7 March 1892 – 2 February 1968) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 25 years old, and a temporary lieutenant in the &#x27;C&#x27; Battery 63rd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 November 1917 at Gonnelieu, France, when the personnel of Lieutenant Wallace&#x27;s battery were reduced to five, having lost their commander and five sergeants, and were surrounded by enemy infantry, he maintained the firing of the guns by swinging the trails close together, the men running and loading from gun to gun. He was in action for eight hours firing the whole time and inflicting severe casualties on the enemy. Then, owing to the exhausted state of his men, he withdrew when the infantry supports arrived, taking with him all essential gun parts and all wounded. His guns were eventually recovered.

He later achieved the rank of captain. He is buried in Moffat Cemetery, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland on right side of main gate.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England.

<text>Pipedreams is a radio music program produced and distributed by American Public Media (APM) based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, created and hosted since its inception by J. Michael Barone. Each one- or two-hour show features organ music, and centers on a theme such as a particular instrument, venue, organ builder, performer, composer, period, etc.

==History==
The program has been in weekly national broadcast syndication since 1983 (following pilot episodes in 1982), and it remains the only nationally syndicated radio program in the United States devoted to organ music. The program is available on APM-affiliated stations and on the &quot;Pipedreams.org&quot; website. In recent years, &quot;Pipedreams&quot;&#x27; weekly radio audience has fluctuated around 200,000 listeners. The program&#x27;s major sponsors include the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of America.

In addition to the radio program itself, &quot;Pipedreams&quot; is also known for producing guided tours, often to Europe with the objective of visiting organs of unique quality or interest. Recordings of these notable instruments are frequently featured in the broadcasts of &quot;Pipedreams&quot;.

==Accolades==
The program&#x27;s major accolades include the 2001 Deems Taylor Radio Broadcast Award for Excellence from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 2017, the American Guild of Organists commissioned a monograph series and published its inaugural volume, &quot;J. Michael Barone and Pipedreams: The Organ on Public Radio&quot;, by Haig Mardirosian.

== In popular culture ==
The program was referenced on Episode 116 (&quot;Santa Claus&quot;) of the cult TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1993.

<doc id="1186707" wikidata="Q413658" url="?curid=1186707" title="Bipyridine">
<text>Bipyridines are a family of organic compounds with the formula (C5H4N)2, consisting of two pyridyl (C5H4N) rings. Pyridine is an aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The bipyridines are all colourless solids, which are soluble in organic solvents and slightly soluble in water. Bipyridines, especially the 4,4&#x27; isomer, are mainly of significance in pesticides. 

Six isomers of bipyridine exist, but two are prominent. 2,2′-bipyridine, also known as bipyridyl, dipyridyl, and dipyridine, is a popular ligand in coordination chemistry 

==2,2′-Bipyridine==

2,2′-Bipyridine (2,2′-bipy) is a chelating ligand that forms complexes with most transition metal ions that are of broad academic interest. Many of these complexes have distinctive optical properties, and some are of interest for analysis. Its complexes are used in studies of electron and energy transfer, supramolecular, and materials chemistry, and catalysis. 

2,2′-Bipyridine is used in the manufacture of diquat.

==4,4′-Bipyridine==

4,4′-Bipyridine (4,4′-bipy) is mainly used as a precursor to the &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dication commonly known as paraquat. This species is redox active, and its toxicity arises from its ability to interrupt biological electron transfer processes. Because of its structure, 4,4′-bipyridine can bridge between metal centres to give coordination polymers.

==3,4′-Bipyridine==
The 3,4′-bipyridine derivatives inamrinone and milrinone are used occasionally for short term treatment of congestive heart failure. They inhibit phosphodiesterase and thus increasing cAMP, exerting positive inotropy and causing vasodilation. Inamrinone causes thrombocytopenia. Milrinone decreases survival in heart failure.

<text>Godfrey Lionel Rampling (14 May 1909 – 20 June 2009) was an English athlete and army officer who competed for Great Britain in the 1932 Summer Olympics and in the 1936 Summer Olympics. He turned 100 on 14 May 2009 and was the oldest living British Olympian at the time of his death.

==Life and career==
Rampling was born in Blackheath, London, the son of Gertrude Anne (Taylor) and Horace Johnson Rampling, a costumier. After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1929. In 1932 he was promoted to lieutenant. Rampling won the British AAA championships 440 yards title at the 1931 AAA Championships and the 1934 AAA Championships. 

At the 1932 Summer Olympics, Rampling was fourth in his semifinal in the individual 400 metre event and didn&#x27;t reach the final, but ran the anchor leg to help the British 4 × 400 m relay team win the silver medal, behind the United States.

At the 1934 British Empire Games in London, Rampling won the , and helped the English 4×440 yards relay team to capture the gold medal.

At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Rampling was again fourth in the semifinals of 400 metre competition and ran the second leg on the British 4 × 400 m relay team which won the gold medal.

Rampling was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Artillery, attached to NATO, until retiring in 1958 after 29 years&#x27; service.

He married Isabel Anne (née Gurteen; 1918–2001); their younger daughter Charlotte became a noted model and film actress. Their eldest daughter Sarah committed suicide in 1967.

He was, as of October 2007, the last surviving male athletics medallist from the 1932 Summer Olympics and the last male gold medallist in athletics from the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Rampling was Britain&#x27;s oldest living Olympic Gold medallist and also oldest living Olympic competitor. He celebrated his centenary with his family on 14 May 2009 at Bushey in Hertfordshire.

Rampling died in his sleep aged 100 on 20 June 2009.

<doc id="1186717" wikidata="Q494102" url="?curid=1186717" title="Zaytun Division">
<text>The Zaytun Division (; ) was a Republic of Korea Army contingent operating in Iraq from September 2004 to December 2008, carrying out peacekeeping and other reconstruction-related tasks as South Korea&#x27;s contribution to the Iraq War.

==Formation==
South Korea dispatched a small contingent of 600 military medics and engineers (the 320th Medical Assistance &#x27;Jerma&#x27; Unit and the 1100th Construction Engineer &#x27;Seoheui&#x27; Unit) to predominantly Shia areas in Southern Iraq in April 2003. The United States government asked South Korea to send additional forces on September 4, 2003. Upon request, Seoul formed the Division &#x27;Zaytun&#x27; (transcription of Arabic word , &#x27;olive&#x27;) which stressed the peace-keeping role of the troops. An additional 2,200 troops (mostly engineers) were deployed to Erbil in the Kurdistan Region of Northern Iraq by early September 2004 and were grouped with the humanitarian troops who were relocated from Southern Iraq. The combined unit consisted of 2,800 soldiers. Another 800 soldiers were dispatched to reinforce the existing troops in Arbil in November 2004, thus increasing the size of South Korea&#x27;s contingent to 3,600.

==Order of battle==
* 11th Reconstruction Brigade
** 111th Reconstruction Battalion
** 112th Reconstruction Battalion
* 12th Reconstruction Brigade
** 121st Reconstruction Battalion
** 122nd Reconstruction Battalion
* 320th Medical Assistance Unit &#x27;Jerma&#x27;
* 1100th Construction Engineer Unit &#x27;Seoheui&#x27;
* Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command (2 Battalions)
* Republic of Korea Army Commando (1 Battalion)
* Republic of Korea Marine Corps (1 Company)

==Timeline and background==
Impassioned opposition to the deployment among both politicians and the public peaked during the captivity of South Korean Kim Sun-il, who was kidnapped on June 17, 2004, and after his execution on June 22, 2004. The incident occurred while the bulk of the Korean contingent was being prepared for its upcoming deployment and triggered a major public debate as to whether they should be sent, involving sometimes violent and vocally anti-American protests.

On October 10, 2004, a little-known Islamist group threatened South Korea in a video posted on an Arabic-language website, promising that they would &quot;make Korea suffer&quot; if its troops were not withdrawn within two weeks. The warning outlined how Korean troops would be attacked &quot;one by one&quot; and also that their families would be targeted in Korea itself. About a week beforehand, Ayman al-Zawahiri mentioned South Korea in a list of countries allied to the US that should be targeted by volunteers. Subsequently, Korean embassies were instructed by then Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon to strengthen security. 

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, traveled to Arbil to visit the South Korean troops on October 10, 2004. On his way home from a visit to Paris, President Roh Moo-hyun made a surprise visit to the Zaytun Division in Arbil on December 8. Throughout 2005, South Korea&#x27;s was the third largest foreign military deployment in Iraq, behind the United Kingdom.

In early 2006, 1,300 troops were withdrawn following a December 2005 vote by the National Assembly (10-3 with one abstention). Another 1,200 troops were sent home in early 2007, and it was widely assumed that a complete pullout would take place by the beginning of 2008, when the deployment mandate was set to expire. However, on October 23, 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun announced that the mandate would be extended for another year, although the size of the contingent will be halved to 600. The decision to yet again renew the mandate came just several weeks away from December elections in South Korea, during which the extremely unpopular military deployment to Iraq was expected to become a significant issue. 

In December 2007, South Korea had 933 personnel deployed; this number had fallen to 520 by October 2008. In a regular briefing on October 29, 2008, Won Tae-jae, a spokesman at the Ministry of Defense said, &quot;The Zaytun army unit, stationed in the city of Arbil in northern Iraq, will begin pulling out of the country in early December, handing the mission over to U.S. troops, and will complete the withdrawal by around December 20, [2008].&quot; A farewell ceremony for the remainder of the South Korean contingent was held on December 1, 2008.

==Other details==
The main tasks of the South Korean contingent were to provide medical services and to build and repair roads, power lines, schools and other public infrastructure. The contingent included a small number of Muslim South Korean soldiers who converted to Islam just before their deployment. The Koreans suffered only one fatality: an officer who committed suicide on the South Korean base in May 2007. The only other deaths attributed to their presence have been accidents involving both South Korean and Iraqi civilians.

<text>Hilo High School is a public, co-educational high school of the Hawaii State Department of Education, and serves grades nine through twelve. Established in 1906, its first class graduated in 1909. Hilo High School is near the Wailuku River in Hawaii County on the Big Island of Hawaii, United States. The campus boasts the black marble terrazzo and gray gravel sculpture &quot;Matrix&quot; by Ken Shutt in the middle of its two patios in its courtyard. The school is situated at 556 Waianuenue Avenue on across the street from Hilo Intermediate School, one of its two feeder schools, the other being Kalanianaole Intermediate School. Hilo&#x27;s symbol and mascot is the Viking and its school colors are blue and gold. Hilo High School celebrated its centennial during Homecoming of 2006. Hilo High School&#x27;s crosstown rivals are the Warriors of Waiakea High School.

==History==
Hilo High School was started by the school authorities in September 1905. The idea for a high school is attributed to Josephine Deyo, principal of Hilo Union School. The weak public interest eventually grew stronger as the public realized the benefits from a high school in Hilo, Hawaii. At the time, the only High Schools on the island were Kau High and Pahala Elementary School and Honokaa High &amp; Intermediate School, both over 30 miles away in rural sugar communities that were disconnected from most of the island and were only accessible by railroad. Most students who wished to attend high school went to boarding school in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The school changed location in 1907 to the District Annex location and was then named Hilo Junior High School. It was moved yet again in 1922 to its present location on Waianuenue Avenue.

==Commencement==
Hilo High School&#x27;s commencement exercises are normally held during the end of May.

Hilo High school has several commencement traditions that stretch back to the school&#x27;s first graduation in 1909. The graduating class recites a variation of Gaudeamus Igitur with lyrics directly referencing Hilo High, and members of the Hilo High School Alumni Association pass out a lei to every graduate. This latter tradition is attributed to the patriarch of the Tong family, who was among the school&#x27;s first graduates and supposedly gave a lei to a fellow graduate who was without one during their commencement ceremony. The Tong family also awarded the school&#x27;s Salutatorian award and trophy with a cash prize until 2003, when the Salutatorian returned the cash prize out of respect for the family&#x27;s disagreement with the school&#x27;s current practice of awarding the Valedictorian distinction to more than one student. The Valedictorian trophy is maintained by the Hilo High School Foundation.

With the introduction of AP classes to Hilo High, it is possible for more than one student to become a valedictorian within the same graduating class. The current requirements for becoming a valedictorian include getting the distinguished BOE diploma as well as getting a weighted GPA of at least 4.0.

<doc id="1186741" wikidata="Q1391329" url="?curid=1186741" title="Ram Gopal Varma">
<text>Penmetsa Ram Gopal Varma (born 7 April 1962), often referred to by his initials RGV, is an Indian film director, screenwriter and producer, primarily known for his work in Hindi and Telugu films. Varma has directed films across multiple genres, including parallel cinema and docudrama noted for their gritty realism, technical finesse, and craft. Regarded as one of the pioneers of new age Indian cinema, he was featured in the BBC World series &quot;Bollywood Bosses&quot; in 2004. In 2006, Grady Hendrix of Film Comment, published by the Film at Lincoln Center cited Varma as &quot;Bombay&#x27;s Most Successful Maverick&quot; for his works on experimental films. He is known for introducing new talents, who eventually become successful in the Indian film industry.

Starting his career as a civil engineer, he made an entry into Telugu cinema with the path-breaking crime thriller, &quot;Siva&quot; (1989) featured at the 13th IFFI&#x27; 90 &quot;Indian Panorama&quot; mainstream section, and has won Varma, the state Nandi Awards for Best direction, Best first film of a director, and the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu. Subsequently, the film was included in CNN-IBN&#x27;s list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. Varma&#x27;s next directorial was &quot;Kshana Kshanam&quot; (1991), the neo-noir heist film being featured at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, won him another Nandi Award for Best Direction, and the Nandi Award for Best Screenplay Writer. The 1993 political drama, &quot;Gaayam&quot; received six state Nandi Awards. In 1999, he directed &quot;Prema Katha&quot; for which he received his third Nandi Award for Best Director.

Varma is known for directing and presenting pan-Indian works casting actors across the country, such as the Indian Political Trilogy, and the Indian Gangster Trilogy; film critic Rajeev Masand had labelled the latter series as one of the &quot;most influential movies of Indian cinema. The first installment of the trilogy, &quot;Satya&quot;, was also listed in CNN-IBN&#x27;s 100 greatest Indian films of all time, fetching Varma the &quot;Bimal Roy Award&quot; for Best Direction. Varma fetched the National Film Award for scripting and producing the political crime drama, &quot;Shool&quot; (1999) cited by &quot;India Today&quot; as the &quot;Best Cop Movie&quot; of the 90&#x27;s. His recent avant-garde works include hits such as the dramatised re-enactment of &quot;Rayalaseema factionism&quot; in &quot;Rakta Charitra&quot; (2010), the &quot;2008 Mumbai attacks&quot; in &quot;The Attacks of 26/11&quot; (2013), the &quot;Operation Cocoon&quot; in &quot;Killing Veerappan&quot; (2016), the &quot;Vijayawada riots&quot; in &quot;Vangaveeti&quot; (2016), N. T. R. in &quot;Lakshmi&#x27;s NTR&quot; (2019), and Konda politics in &quot;Konda&quot; (2022).

==Early life and background==
Varma was born on 7 April 1962 in a Telugu family to Krishna Raju Varma and Suryavathi. In an interview with Lakshmi Manchu on a talk show, Varma said that he was born in Nampally, Hyderabad. He did his schooling at St. Mary&#x27;s High School, Secunderabad and completed his BE degree in Civil engineering from V.R. Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada. Even during this period, Varma remained a film buff, through his uncle. Varma would skip classes often and watch films instead. He would watch the same film repeatedly &quot;just to watch certain scenes which interested him.&quot; According to him, that is how he learned film direction.

In an interview to &quot;Tehelka&quot;, Varma talked about his relationship with his parents and the reasons behind his decision to become a filmmaker.
==Film career, craft and style==
After a brief stint as a site engineer for Krishna Oberoi hotel in Hyderabad, he put his dreams on the back burner and decided to go to Nigeria to make some money. It was at this moment that he visited a video rental library in Hyderabad. He loved the idea and decided to start one of his own at Ameerpet in Hyderabad, through which he slowly developed connections with the film world. His father at that time was a long time sound engineer at Annapurna Studios. After working as an assistant director in &quot;Collector Gari Abbai&quot; and &quot;Rao Gari Illu&quot;, Akkineni Nageswara Rao gave him the opportunity to direct the 1989 cult blockbuster, &quot;Siva&quot;, after being impressed by him.

Rachel Dwyer, a reader in &quot;world cinema&quot; at the University of London-Department of South Asia, marked Varma&#x27;s &quot;Satya&quot; as an experiment with a new genre, a variation of film noir that has been called &quot;Mumbai Noir&quot;, of which Varma is the acknowledged master. In 2010, Varma received critical acclaim at the Fribourg International Film Festival, Switzerland; a retrospective of his filmography, highlighting &quot;Mumbai Noir&quot; was staged by film critic Edouard Waintrop, a delegate in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight of the Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Satya&quot; and &quot;Company&quot;, in particular, were cited by British director Danny Boyle as influences on his Academy Award-winning film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), for their &quot;slick, often mesmerizing portrayals of the Mumbai underworld&quot;, their display of &quot;brutality and urban violence&quot;, and their gritty realism.

In 2005, Varma directed the Godfatheresque-&quot;Sarkar&quot;, another super-hit thriller inspired by the life of Bal Thackeray and North Indian politics, which was screened to special mention at the New York Asian Film Festival, along with its sequel &quot;Sarkar Raj&quot;, which premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and the 9th IIFA World Premiere-Bangkok, and was archived at the Academy of Motion Pictures library. In 2013, he directed a docudrama, &quot;The Attacks of 26/11&quot;, showcased to critical acclaim at the Berlin International Film Festival, in the Panorama as well as the Competition section, and was premièred at Films Division of India. The film received highly positive reviews, with critics praising Varma&#x27;s narrative of assistant commissioner N. R. Mahale, and the discrepancies associated with Mahale&#x27;s interaction with Ajmal Kasab on anti terrorism.

===Influences===
Varma&#x27;s philosophy is influenced by Russian-American Novelist Ayn Rand, Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and authors like James Hadley Chase and Frederick Forsyth, as well as by &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. Varma&#x27;s first runaway hit in Hindi cinema was &quot;Shiva&quot; (1990), the remake of his 1989 film &quot;Siva&quot;. Varma introduced the steadicam to Indian cinema with &quot;Siva&quot;. Later, he garnered attention in Bollywood with the romantic comedy film, &quot;Rangeela&quot; (1995) starring Aamir Khan. The film won seven Filmfare Awards. Rangeela was later remade in Hollywood as Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!.

He then directed &quot;Satya&quot; (1998), which won six Filmfare Awards, including the Critics Award for Best Film, In 2005, &quot;Indiatimes Movies&quot; included &quot;Satya&quot; in its list of &quot;25 Must See Bollywood Movies&quot;. Satya was showcased among the Indian panorama section, at the 1998 International Film Festival of India, Varma received the Bimal Roy memorial award for best direction for this film. In the same year, he co-produced &quot;Dil Se..&quot;, directed by Mani Ratnam, screened at the 1999 Berlin Film Festival, and won the Netpac Award, as well as two National Film Awards and six Filmfare Awards. &quot;Satya&quot;, together with his 2002 film &quot;Company&quot; (which he directed, won three IIFA Awards, seven Filmfare Awards, and a Bollywood Movie Award for best direction, and was premiered at the 2004 Austin Film Festival) and the 2005 film &quot;D&quot; (which he produced), were also featured in the Fribourg International Film Festival, and the New York Asian Film Festival.

===Experimental films===
In the early 1990&#x27;s, Varma experimented with the supernatural thriller, &quot;Raat&quot; (1991), and the neo-noir crime thriller, &quot;Drohi&quot; (1992), which were not commercially successful, but gained a cult following post-release. During the years between his trilogy, from &quot;Satya&quot; in 1998 to &quot;D&quot; in 2005, Varma implemented different film genres in his craft. In 1999, he directed &quot;Kaun&quot;, a suspense thriller set entirely in one house and featuring only three actors, and &quot;Mast&quot;, a subversion of Hindi cinema&#x27;s masala genre. In 2000, he directed &quot;Jungle&quot;, set entirely in a jungle, for which he was nominated for the Star Screen Award for Best Director. In 2003 he directed another supernatural thriller &quot;Bhoot&quot; on the lines of his earlier hit &quot;Raat&quot;. &quot;Bhoot&quot; became a major hit at the box office, and Varma was nominated for the Filmfare Best Director Award for the film.

&quot;Bhoot&quot; was followed by even more horror movies, including hit films such as &quot;Darna Mana Hai&quot; (2003), &quot;Darna Zaroori Hai&quot; (2006), and &quot;Phoonk&quot; (2008), gaining Varma the status of ster of the Indian horror genre. Other experimental productions of Varma include &quot;Ek Hasina Thi&quot; (2003), a psychological thriller, and &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan&quot; (2004), a film about an inspector in the Mumbai Encounter Squad noted for having killed 56 people in encounters, featured at the Fantastic Fest. 
In 2006, he re-made a new installment of &quot;Shiva&quot;, which was screened at the New York Asian Film Festival, where in a retrospective featuring Varma&#x27;s experimental hits such as &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Ek Hasina Thi&quot;, &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan&quot;, &quot;Sarkar&quot;, &quot;Contract&quot;, and &quot;Shabri&quot; was staged. &quot;Shabri&quot; was also screened at Rome Film Festival. 2010 film on media, &quot;Rann&quot; was screened at Toronto International Film Festival.

<doc id="1186743" wikidata="Q6911062" url="?curid=1186743" title="More Tears">
<text>More Tears is a 1998 seriocomedy television series that was broadcast by CBC Television, as a short run programme; it was written and produced by Ken Finkleman following the success of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; (1996), and was partly a remake of &quot;8½&quot; (1963), by Federico Fellini.

As in &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, George Findlay (Ken Finkleman) is the protagonist of &quot;More Tears&quot;, as a documentary producer, who manipulated his subjects in order to create better television drama. In the final installment, Findlay abandoned the documentary form to film a satire of the neo-conservative government of Mike Harris, the Premier of Ontario. The programme also explored the personal life of George Findlay, his unhappy marriage, and his unhappy extra-marital affairs.

The cast of &quot;More Tears&quot; (1998) also included Hrant Alianak, Yank Azman, Arsinée Khanjian, Leah Pinsent, Evan Solomon, and Kenny Vadas.

Finkleman&#x27;s next project for the CBC was the series &quot;Foolish Heart&quot;.

<doc id="1186746" wikidata="Q5372439" url="?curid=1186746" title="Emily Yoffe">
<text>Emily J. Yoffe (born October 15, 1955) is an American journalist and contributing writer for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. From 1998 to 2016 she was a regular contributor to &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, notably as Dear Prudence. She has also written for &quot;The New York Times; O, The Oprah Magazine; The Washington Post;&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot;; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;; &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;; and many other publications. Yoffe began her career as a staff writer at &quot;The New Republic&quot; before moving on to other publications.

== Education ==
Yoffe grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Wellesley College in 1977. 

== Career ==
In 2006 outgoing columnist Margo Howard turned &quot;Slate&quot;″s &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; advice column over to Yoffe. The column appears four times per week, including one day of live chats and one day in which the letters are responded to using a video instead of text. In November 2015, Yoffe published her last &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; column, and was replaced by Daniel M. Lavery, co-founder of &quot;The Toast&quot;. Lavery left Dear Prudence in 2021.

Yoffe also hosted a podcast called &quot;Manners for the Digital Age&quot; with &quot;Slate&quot;″s then-technology columnist Farhad Manjoo.

She wrote a regular feature on &quot;Slate&quot; called &quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot;, in which she attempted unusual activities or hobbies. For &quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot;, she has tried hypnosis, and taken a vow of silence. She has become a street performer, a nude model for an art class, and a contestant in the Mrs. America beauty pageant.

In June 2005, Bloomsbury published Yoffe&#x27;s &quot;What the Dog Did: Tales from a Formerly Reluctant Dog Owner&quot;. That year it was named Best Book of the Year by Dogwise, and selected as the Best General Interest Dog Book by the Dog Writers Association of America.

She was a guest on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; twice. She discussed her experiences as &quot;Slate&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot;, and an article about narcissistic personality disorder. She has been a guest on numerous radio programs, including &quot;The Emily Rooney Show&quot; and Minnesota Public Radio.

Yoffe has written pieces about the worldwide disappearance of frogs and the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. She has written op-eds for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on global warming, motherhood, and politics.

As of December 2022, she is a writer for &quot;The Free Press&quot;.

=== Writings on the Me Too movement and campus sexual assault===
Yoffe has written extensively about campus sexual assault and the Obama administration&#x27;s effort to end it, describing the administration&#x27;s reforms of Title IX – the United States federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in federally-funded education programs – as a worthy goal that went awry. Her article in &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The College Rape Overcorrection&quot; was a National Magazine Award finalist in Public Service in 2015. She wrote a series on campus sexual assault for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on due process, junk science, and racial disparities. The series was a nominee for Top Ten Works of Journalism of the Decade by New York University&#x27;s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute.

She has praised the Me Too movement; but expressed concerns about overreach. She wrote about &quot;The Problem With #BelieveSurvivors&quot;, the consequences of Al Franken&#x27;s resignation from the Senate, and the dangers of &quot;endlessly expand[ing] the categories of victim and perpetrator.&quot;

She is a signer of A Letter on Justice and Open Debate published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. She is a member of the board of advisors of Persuasion.community, an organization that says it defends the ideals of a free society, for which she wrote &quot;A Taxonomy of Fear&quot;, which describes her understanding of the term &quot;cancel culture&quot;.

=== Writings on transgender rights ===
In March 2023, Yoffe interviewed whistleblower Jamie Reed for &quot;The Free Press&quot;, whose claims that children were harmed through inadequate care at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children&#x27;s Hospital have been disputed by several former coworkers and the parents of many patients. The claims are currently being investigated by The Washington University Transgender Center and the State of Missouri. In April 2023, Yoffe wrote an article interviewing a mother whose child received gender-affirming care from the Washington University Medical Center, claiming that the receipt of this care made her child&#x27;s mental health deteriorate. A Twitter user saying they were the child has contradicted these claims on social media, saying that their deteriorating mental health at the time of receiving gender-affirming care had nothing to do with them being transgender and that they felt the article violated their consent.

<text>Horace Waller VC (23 September 1896 – 10 April 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for &quot;gallantry in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Waller was born 23 September 1896, in Batley Carr, Dewsbury, Yorkshire, to John Edward and Esther Waller, of Dewsbury, Yorkshire.

<text>Colonel William Francis Frederick Waller, VC (20 August 1839 – 29 January 1885) was a Bengal Army and British Indian Army officer. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

Waller was born at Dagoolie, India, on 20 August 1839. He was the son of Thomas Waller &amp; his wife Alicia Ann née Gilbert. He married Mary Anna Grierson on 16 June 1864 at Bombay, India.

Waller was eighteen years old, and a lieutenant in the 25th Bombay Light Infantry during the Indian Mutiny. On 20 June 1858 at Gwalior, British India, Waller and another officer who was killed during the action, Lieutenant Rose, were the only Europeans present at the storming of the Gwalior Fort. With a handful of men they organised a surprise attack by night on the fort, climbing onto the roof of a house, shooting the gunners who opposed them, and, after hand-to-hand fighting, taking the fort, killing everyone in it. Rose was killed, but for his part in the action Waller was awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation read:
However, the award was not gazetted until 25 February 1862.

He later transferred to the Indian Political Department and achieved the rank of colonel. He died at Bath, Somerset, on 29 January 1885 and is buried there in the Locksbrook Cemetery. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Family==
Waller married and had children, including Frederick Charles Livingston Waller.

<text>Waiākea High School is a public, co-educational secondary school in Hilo, Hawaii. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Warrior. It is part of the Hawaii State Department of Education. Founded in 1976, the school graduated its first class in 1980. The campus boasts the sculpture &quot;Landscape on the Ocean&quot; by Satoru Abe. Waiākea High School&#x27;s crosstown rival is Hilo High School.

== History ==
In 1976, the school opened to 17 teachers and 385 sophomore students and was founded about ten years after adjacent schools Waiakea Elementary and Waiakea Intermediate were built. Before the high school was built, the only public high school in the Hilo area was Hilo High School.

In 2002, a fire started overnight in building R and caused an estimated $400,000 in damage. The building was restored and reopened in 2005. In 2006, another fire broke out, purportedly started by an arsonist, causing a purported $1.5 million in damage.

In 2012, funds were released to construct a new all weather track and football field. Phase 1 finished in 2014, opening the turf field. Phase 2 was completed in 2016, opening new training facilities, constructing new bleachers, and adding a building with a concession and restrooms. The facility was named the Ken Yamase Memorial Stadium, after former athletic director Ken Yamase who passed away in 2008.

In 2023, the tennis courts were resurfaced.

=== School shooting threat ===
In April 2023, Waiakea High and other schools within the Waiakea complex received a threat of a school shooting. The school was put on lockdown, and Hawaii Police Department was called on-scene. It was later deemed to be a hoax, called in by an anonymous caller.

=== Principals ===
Waiākea High School has had a number of principals over its history. They are as follows in chronological order: Robert Bean, John Sosa, Danford Sakai, Michael Tokioka, Patricia Nekoba, and currently Kelcy Koga.

A Honolulu Star-Bulletin article (published Monday, February 18, 2002) states, &quot;Since its beginning, Waiākea has had six principals: Robert Bean, John Sosa, Danford Sakai, Michael Tokioka, Patricia Nekoba and currently Judith Saranchock. It has had three principals and two interim principals in the past four years.&quot; It is uncertain if all &quot;three principals and two interim principals&quot; were included in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin&#x27;s list.

The current principal, Kelcy Koga, returned to Waiākea High School after the retirement of Dr. Patricia Nekoba, who left in December 2006. He previously served as Vice Principal until his departure for Haʻaheo Elementary School. As of the 2024-2025 school year, he is still principal.

== Awards ==
The school was a recipient of the Hawaii Frito Lay Blue Ribbon award in 1989 and 1996. Additionally, it has received Academy Model accreditation status for several of its academies by the National Career Academy Coalition.

In 2019, the student council won a Decade of Excellence award from the National Association of Student Councils. It also won National Council of Excellence Awards between 2020 and 2023.

In 2021, biology teacher and alumnus Whitney Aragaki was a recipient of 2022 Hawai&#x27;i State Teacher of the Year and was National Teacher of the Year Finalist. In 2025, she was a recipient of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.

== Campus ==
The school sits on 43 acres of land adjacent to Waiakea Elementary and Waiakea Intermediate School. When the school was opened, it only had 2 portables and 3 buildings. These buildings were later redesignated as buildings E, F, and I. The school features a quad, a grassy area where in-school events occur. The quad is located next to the Student Activities Coordinator&#x27;s office, who coordinates the events. By 2001, the school had 21 buildings, including a gymnasium, cafeteria, and a library.

==Academics==

=== Curriculum ===
Waiakea High School offers advanced placement and Early College classes for 10th-12th graders, along with Running Start classes for 11th-12th graders. As of 2024, the school offers 10 Advanced Placement classes. These classes include AP English, AP Literature, AP World History, AP Calculus, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science, AP Seminar and AP Research. Classes are open to all students, however may be restricted by grade level or other prerequisites.

For language offerings, Waiakea High offers four language classes: Hawaiian, French, Japanese, and Spanish, offerings up to 4 levels per language. Language requirements vary by academy, although most academies do not require it.

For mathematics, Waiakea High offers an &quot;accelerated program&quot;. This allows students to take Geometry in freshman year, skipping the Algebra I class usually assigned to freshman students. This allows for AP Calculus to be taken in senior year.

=== Academies ===
In 2003, Waiākea High School began restructuring itself into Smaller Learning Communities from money allocated through a federal grant. These Smaller Learning Communities (more commonly referred to as SLCs or Academies) include a Freshman Academy for 9th grade and career academies for 10-12th graders. For 10th grade enrollment, students are required to choose a career academy elective.

The career academies are: Arts &amp; Communications, Academy of Industry &amp; Technology, Health Services, and Public Services. Each career academy has 3 pathways, for a total of 12 overall. As part of the academy system, each career academy requires its own designated amount of community service hours. Within these academies, students are given opportunities for mentorships and work-based learning experiences. Regular core classes are based around their career academy. For instance, core classes in the Arts &amp; Communication academy are more creative based, while Industry and Technology have their core classes geared towards its individual pathways.

To graduate, students are required to do a senior project.

<text>Foolish Heart is a Canadian television series which aired on CBC Television in 1999. The series, a short run dramatic anthology, was produced and written by Ken Finkleman following his earlier series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; and &quot;More Tears&quot;.

Although the episodes are linked by character interactions, each of the series&#x27; six episodes focus on a different character&#x27;s family or romantic relationship problems. Finkleman also stars in the series as George Findlay, the same character he plays in &quot;The Newsroom&quot; and &quot;More Tears&quot;.

The series won Finkleman a 1999 Gemini Award for Best Direction in a Dramatic Series.

The cast also includes Arsinée Khanjian, Sarah Strange, Tom McCamus, Nancy Beatty, Patricia O&#x27;Callaghan and Chris Benson.

Finkleman&#x27;s next project for the CBC was the series &quot;Foreign Objects&quot;.

<text>Canal 13 is a Chilean free-to-air television network. Informally known in Chile as El 13 (The Thirteen), it is the second oldest television station in the country. Launched on August 21, 1959, on VHF channel 2 in Santiago, it was founded by a group of engineers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. The station later moved its frequency to VHF channel 13, which gave rise to its current name. One of its most significant milestones was broadcasting the 1962 FIFA World Cup, hosted in Chile.

It was originally named &quot;Corporación de Televisión de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile&quot; (Television Corporation of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile) until 2010, when the university sold most of its shares to Andrónico Luksic Craig&#x27;s . In 2017, Grupo Luksic acquired full ownership of the channel.

Its central studios are located in the Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte Television Centre, which has housed the channel&#x27;s production and broadcast facilities since the 1980s. The complex is situated in Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region, and covers 5 hectares. Since 1998, the facility has been named after the station&#x27;s deceased executive director, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, who was one of the longest-serving individuals in that position.

==History==
===1952-1973: Experimental tests and early years of the channel===

On November 25, 1952, the first RCA Victor brand industrial television equipment was received in Santiago, Chile. It was acquired by the Catholic University in association with the Chilean subsidiary of the North American firm. Two teams were immediately established at the university to oversee the use of the system: a technical team led by engineer Julio del Río and an artistic team directed by Germán Becker. On December 12 of that year, the first experimental program was broadcast in a closed circuit from the Auditorium of the School of Physics at the Catholic University. The broadcast, though marked by several technical errors, was considered a success. In January 1953, the university&#x27;s television department collaborated with Radio Minería for a special broadcast of its program &quot;La Cadena de la Amistad&quot;, marking the first public television broadcast in Chile.

In 1959, Pedro Caraball was appointed head of the Electronics Department. At the same time, a 100 W audio transmitter was built and new Philips industrial equipment was purchased, leading to the first test transmissions on July 17. On August 21 of that year, at 7:00 p.m., experimental transmissions formally began from an attic on the fourth floor of the Central House, with a receiver installed in the reception of &quot;El Diario Ilustrado&quot;. These transmissions used VHF channel 2 and featured a schedule of three films per week. The broadcasts were interrupted on December 31 due to an accident that affected the transmitter. In January 1960, the Television Department was established, and Juan Ángel Torti was appointed as its director to officially organize the station.

The test transmissions ended on Saturday, April 15, 1961, at 6:00 p.m., when the Catholic University’s television station began its official broadcasts on channel 13. Since April 3 of the same year, test broadcasts had been conducted from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. to adjust the equipment. A studio was built in the University&#x27;s Central House, from which &quot;Recuerdos de la Pérgola de las Flores&quot;, the channel&#x27;s first program, was broadcast. Additionally, &quot;El Show de Antonio Prieto&quot; and &quot;Tricotilandia&quot;, the first entertainment programs on Chilean television, were produced in the same studio. These programs were also the first to introduce commercial advertising to Chilean television.

In 1962, now definitively using channel 13, the station successfully broadcast the 1962 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Chile. This achievement was made possible by new equipment, including five cameras, a transmitter, and a link team, which had been received on March 29 of that year. Canal 13 was responsible for broadcasting the matches between Chile and Italy, Germany and Switzerland, as well as the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final of the championship. After the World Cup, the channel ceased broadcasts for nearly a month to make technical adjustments, resuming on Sunday, July 22, with the broadcast of the first part of &quot;La Pérgola de las Flores&quot;, which was divided into four parts aired every Sunday. That day also featured performances by the musical groups The Dreamers, The Strangers, and María Teresa Larraín.

In August of that year, &quot;Show Dominical&quot; began to air. In 1965, it moved to Saturdays as &quot;Sábados Alegres&quot;, and later, with its extended length, was renamed &quot;Sábados Gigantes.&quot; This became the oldest and most successful variety program in Latin America, hosted by Mario Kreutzberger, better known as Don Francisco. On October 2, 1962, the channel&#x27;s studios were officially inaugurated in a ceremony led by Darío Aliaga, Eduardo Tironi, and Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez.

In 1963, the first Press Department of Chilean television was established, directed by journalist Leonardo Cáceres. That same year, the Dramatic Department was created under the direction of Hugo Miller. The teletheater &quot;The Greenhouse&quot; (1963) debuted, starring Malú Gatica, who was returning to the country after her time in Hollywood, and marked the debut of Sonia Viveros. The following year, the first national fiction series, &quot;This Is My Family&quot;, began broadcasting, starring Malú Gatica.

In 1964, Channel 13 started broadcasting seven days a week and covered the presidential elections on September 4, where Eduardo Frei Montalva was elected president. On April 1, 1965, the series &quot;El Liter 4916&quot; premiered with great success. Meanwhile, &quot;The Secret History of the Big News&quot; became the first documentary program on Chilean television. On December 27 of that same year, the channel introduced the videotape system by recording the teletheater &quot;The Browning Version&quot; with newly received equipment, launched with the help of Argentine technicians. Four days later, at 11:45 p.m. on December 31, 1965, the channel broadcast its first program recorded on videotape: a musical presentation by Marianela and Los Gatos, along with a greeting from Eduardo Tironi, the station director.

In 1967, the channel achieved another success with the comedy &quot;Juani en Society&quot;, starring Sonia Viveros and Silvia Piñeiro. In October of that year, it received new mobile transmission equipment, including a videotape system, which enabled the recording of outdoor scenes. On August 9, 1968, the channel received its first satellite transmission, corresponding to a live broadcast from the Chilean Embassy in Washington D.C., to mark the inauguration of the Longovilo earth station. On July 20 and 21, 1969, it covered the transmission of man&#x27;s arrival on the Moon via satellite in conjunction with Channel 9 and National Television of Chile, the latter still in experimental transmissions.

On March 1, 1970, the Teletrece news program debuted, becoming the oldest news program on Chilean television still on air. In 1971, the channel became an associate member of the European Broadcasting Union. In 1972, Angelito de Canal 13, the first mascot of Channel 13 created by Enrique Bustamante, was introduced, and priest Raúl Hasbún took over as the channel&#x27;s new director.

On December 24, 1972, the channel expanded its transmissions to the cities of San Fernando and Curicó on frequency 5, known in both cities as &quot;Canal 5,&quot; officially beginning broadcasts on January 3, 1973. On February 8, 1973, Channel 5, a subsidiary station of Channel 13 in Concepción, also began broadcasting. The legislation in effect at that time (from 1970) did not account for the geographical expansion of university channels, leading to significant controversy. Channel 13&#x27;s campaign for national coverage was contentious, particularly due to its editorial stance opposing the then-current government, in stark contrast to National Television of Chile and Channel 9 of the University of Chile.

On September 11, 1973—the day of the coup d&#x27;état against the government of Salvador Allende—Channel 13 was the only television outlet authorized to broadcast by order of the Military Government Junta. For three days, Channel 13 used TVN&#x27;s frequency network, as TVN and Channel 9 were off the air.

===1974-1999: New television center and expansion===

In 1974, due to issues with the new rector of the Catholic University, Jorge Swett Madge—appointed by the Military Junta—Raúl Hasbún resigned from his position. Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte succeeded him. Programming increased, and starting in March of that year, the channel began its daily broadcasts at 9:00 a.m. and continued until 1:00 a.m. It also retransmitted its programs on a delayed basis to La Serena and Coquimbo after signing an agreement with Canal 8 UCV Televisión in 1975.

In 1976, the channel broadcast, in conjunction with National Television, the Chilean team&#x27;s matches in the Davis Cup and the playoff match of the Copa Libertadores final between Cruzeiro and River Plate at the National Stadium. The channel also extended its signal to other parts of Chile, inaugurating a repeater in Valparaíso and Viña del Mar in November 1976 on channel 8, a frequency previously held by UCV Televisión until February 1969. In December 1976, the channel signed an agreement with the Universidad del Norte Television Network, allowing it to retransmit its programs in Antofagasta, Arica, Calama, Chuquicamata, Iquique, María Elena, and Tocopilla.

In 1975, the Treasury ended the subsidies it had periodically granted to university television stations since their inception. Consequently, Canal 13 began to finance itself solely through advertising and contributions from the Catholic University. However, advertising revenues soon allowed the channel to operate as a commercial station and generate additional profits. This new direction was symbolized by programs created by director Gonzalo Bertrán and presenter César Antonio Santis, who joined from National Television in 1976. They first produced musical specials featuring foreign artists and later created two-hour variety shows, starting with &quot;Esta noche fiesta&quot; in 1977.

On April 12, 1978, color television transmissions were authorized in Chile, establishing the American NTSC standard as official. Canal 13 adapted quickly, acquiring four RCA TK-760 cameras and a TK-28 equipment within three months. By June, the channel, along with National Television, broadcast the Soccer World Cup from Argentina using this new technology. On December 2 of that year, Canal 13, TVN, and the channels of the University of Chile and the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso organized and broadcast the OTI Song Festival at the Municipal Theater of Santiago. Additionally, on December 8 and 9, the channels came together again to broadcast the first Teletón.

In 1981, the soap operas &quot;La Madrastra&quot; and &quot;Casagrande&quot; and the news programs &quot;Teletarde&quot; and &quot;Telenoche&quot; premiered. Following this, the channel&#x27;s production increased, and on May 15, 1983, it inaugurated its Television Center in Providencia, moving from the studios on Lira Street. Studio D at the former location, where &quot;La Madrastra&quot; was recorded, had suffered a fire on July 20, 1981. One of the first programs produced in the new studios was the variety show &quot;Martes 13&quot;, which launched live from Studio 3 on July 7, 1983. Additionally, Canal 13 continued to expand, premiering its signal in Talca on August 21, 1984, through channel 8, and extending to Chillán and Los Angeles through channel 13 on December 18.

On March 3, 1985, Channel 13 extended the edition of &quot;Teletrece&quot; until around 1 a.m. in response to the earthquake in Algarrobo. Additionally, on March 8 and 9, the channel organized the first edition of the &quot;Chile ayuda a Chile&quot; campaign to gather aid for earthquake victims, with a broadcast that lasted more than 30 hours. On September 6 of that year, it began broadcasting in Constitución through channel 9. In 1986, in collaboration with National Television, it broadcast the Davis Cup match involving the Chilean team and premiered the telenovela &quot;Ángel Malo&quot;, an adaptation of a Brazilian telenovela from 1975, during the first half of the year. The channel also broadcast &quot;Secreto de Familia&quot; in the second half of the year. Canal 13 continued its expansion by reaching Cauquenes (channel 7) and Temuco (channel 4), with transmissions in Temuco beginning on July 18. In June, it broadcast the 1986 FIFA World Cup from Mexico with TVN, and on July 30, it inaugurated Channel 5&#x27;s studios in Concepción, modeled after the Providencia Television Center.

In 1987, Channel 13 expanded its reach to several cities: Puerto Montt (channel 13), Osorno (channel 9, starting October 28), Angol (channel 10), San Felipe, Lebu, Lautaro, Traiguén, and Saladillo. From April 1 to 5, it broadcast Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Chile live as the official channel, at the request of the Chilean episcopate, and was the only station to cover the entire event. Additionally, on August 7 and 8, &quot;Sábados Gigantes&quot; celebrated its 25th anniversary with a 25-hour special program. Finally, from October 10 to 25, it co-broadcast the U-20 Soccer World Cup held in Chile that year with National Television.

During 1990, Universidad Católica de Chile Televisión achieved national coverage, reaching from Arica (channel 8) to Quellón (channel 5). On May 29, 1991, the channel, along with Televisión Nacional de Chile, broadcast the final match of the 1991 Copa Libertadores, achieving high ratings for both channels. The broadcast was presented by Pedro Carcuro, Ignacio Hernández (for TVN), and Alberto Fouillioux (for Channel 13). On June 5, both channels broadcast the second leg of the 1991 Copa Libertadores final, again with high ratings for both stations. This broadcast was directed by Gonzalo Bertrán and presented by Pedro Carcuro, Sergio Livingstone (for TVN), Alberto Fouillioux, and Julio Martínez (for Channel 13). Additionally, on June 28, the channel added the American series The Simpsons to its schedule, which became a long-standing and iconic program on Channel 13. Coverage continued to expand in 1991, reaching Vallenar, Rancagua, and Punta Arenas. At the beginning of 1992, the channel began broadcasting in the communes of Petorca and Illapel. In Punta Arenas, the signal began transmitting on May 15, 1991, with 6 hours of programming initially, which was gradually extended. This system remained in place until April 1993, when it was replaced by live satellite signals from Santiago.

On March 16, 1992, the press department underwent a restructuring, with Eduardo Riveros taking over at &quot;Teletarde&quot;. As a result, Jeanette Frazier and the announcer Augusto Gatica left the news reading roles. Gatica then became the official voice-over of the channel, along with Christian Gordon, until August 1997. Additionally, on December 26, &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; was broadcast for the last time from Santiago; the program subsequently moved to the Univision network in the United States. The soap operas &quot;Marrón Glacé&quot; and &quot;Doble Juego&quot; were also released. Furthermore, Channel 13 achieved definitive national coverage with its arrival in the Aysén Region.
In December 1994, the final stage of the Television Center was inaugurated with the presence of President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte. The center became the television channel with the largest infrastructure area in the country at that time, covering 30,000 square meters. That same year, Punta Arenas began to be broadcast in Compressed Digital Image format via satellite from the channel&#x27;s Press Department. On May 1, 1995, the press department underwent a renewal, with Javier Miranda taking over &quot;Teletrece&quot;, Eduardo Riveros heading &quot;Teletarde&quot;, and Jorge Díaz Saenger or Loreto Delpin in &quot;Telenoche&quot;. On July 25, &quot;Martes 13&quot; was broadcast for the last time, and on October 16, &quot;Viva el Lunes&quot; premiered.

In 1996, the channel broadcast the Chilean team&#x27;s matches in the Davis Cup, a trend that continued in 1997 and 1998. Additionally, in February of that year, it extended its signal to Coyhaique on channel 6. However, on November 13, Channel 13 ended local production in Concepción after 23 years due to economic issues, converting Channel 5 into a full-time repeater of programming from Santiago. On April 24, Channel 13 broadcast the Qualifiers for France &#x27;98, covering the Chilean soccer team&#x27;s away matches against Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador. In 1997, the channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day on weekends and premiered telenovelas such as &quot;Adrenalina&quot;, &quot;Playa Salvaje&quot;, &quot;Marparaíso&quot;, and &quot;Fuera de Control&quot;.

In 1998, Channel 13 was awarded the broadcast rights to the Copa Libertadores de América, which had previously belonged to Megavisión. The channel also acquired the children’s program &quot;Cachureos&quot;, which had previously been broadcast on Televisión Nacional and had four seasons on Channel 13. Additionally, in July, the channel broadcast the Chilean team&#x27;s Davis Cup match against Colombia for the last time. On July 18, Eleodoro Rodríguez Matte, the director of the television station since 1974, passed away. Rodrigo Jordán succeeded him as director on August 6.

===1999-2009: Editorial and programming changes===
In 1999, Channel 13 began broadcasting on the Internet through its website canal13.cl and aired the religious microprogram &quot;Reflexiones&quot; for the last time. On June 18, the channel updated its corporate image, retiring its classic logo and mascot.

===2010-2017: Operation under Grupo Luksic and the Catholic University===
In January 2010, following a crisis caused by low ratings and the failure of several programs, several key figures at the channel resigned, including Executive Director Mercedes Ducci, Press Director Pilar Bernstein, and General Manager Sergio Cavagnaro. After Ducci&#x27;s resignation, Jorge Herrera, the president of the Corporation&#x27;s Advisory Council, assumed the role of executive director on an interim basis. In April, the new rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Ignacio Sánchez, appointed Marcelo von Chrismar Werth as the new Executive Director. In June, Patricio Hernández was reinstated as Director of Programming, and journalist Eliana Rozas was appointed as Director of Press. Additionally, Deportes 13 and the reporting area were made directly dependent on the Press Department, ceasing to be autonomous areas of the channel. This restructuring occurred amid a climate of crisis within the channel due to low viewership, increased financial losses, and the failure of many new programs. There were also early signs of stagnation in advertising investments, attributed to competition from the Internet.

<text>George Walters VC (15 September 1829 – 3 June 1872) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
George was born on 15 September 1829 in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. His father was James Walters, an Innkeeper in that town. His mother was Jane Green. George was the third child of seven. There are no records of George’s early life and we can only speculate his reasons for joining the Army. &#x27;Going for a soldier&#x27; in mid-Victorian England was still not a respectable thing to do but, as industrialism spread, so there was less need for men on the land and unemployment began to be a factor.

==49th Regiment==
On 1 June 1744, the eight independent companies garrisoning Jamaica were amalgamated into a Regiment on the advice of the Governor, Edward Trelawney who, although he had no previous military experience, was appointed Colonel and the Regiment called Trelawney’s Regiment, as it was the fashion at the time to name Regiments after their Colonel. This Regiment was at first numbered 63rd but after the re-organisation of 1748 it finally became the 49th Regiment of Foot.

In 1782, Regiments were given County titles to assist in recruiting. The 49th Regiment then became known as the 49th (Hertfordshire) Regiment.
The 49th returned from the war in Canada in July 1815 and almost immediately marched from Weymouth where they discarded their battered campaign clothing for new scarlet coats, neat white breeches, black shako and gaiters, and took over the duties of guarding such members of the royal family who were in residence there. Everything was pipe clayed and polished, the appearance of the men on parade had such an effect on the youthful Princess Charlotte that she begged that the 49th might be &#x27;her&#x27; Regiment. This was approved, and the title Princess Charlotte of Wales&#x27;s Regiment was granted later that year.

In 1841, the 49th was sent from India to take part in the First Opium War with China, and it was in action at the capture of Chusan, Canton, Amoy and Shanghai. In consequence of the consistent gallantry displayed by all ranks during the campaign the Regiment was awarded, as a badge, the Dragon super scribed &#x27;China&#x27;. It is the China Dragon that later became the cap badge of the Royal Berkshire Regiment and formed the centrepiece of the Regimental badge of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Royal Regiment.

The British Army alone was an all-volunteer force, whose soldiers enlisted for an initial period of ten years in the Infantry. George Walters joined the 49th in 1848 and was promoted to the rank of Sergeant within six years.

==Crimea==
On 5 November 1854, the Russians marched out of the besieged city of Sebastopol to throw off the allied British and French forces by mounting a joint attack with their troops from outside the city. Despite outnumbering their enemies five to one the Russians failed to achieve what looked to be a foregone conclusion. This was the third major action of the Crimea War. The battle fought in heavy fog at Inkermann proved to be a testament to the skill and initiative of the individual men and officers of the British Army of the day. Inkermann was an infantry battle of the Crimean War, when the Russians attacked the British forces besieging Sebastopol under cover of fog. In the battle 8,000 British soldiers sustained a hand-to-hand combat with 50,000 Russian troops and it was always referred to as &quot;the soldiers&#x27; battle&quot;.

Very early in the morning, the Russians came out again, this time in much greater strength, and made for the British positions on the Inkermann ridge. The morning was wet and misty, and the visibility was so bad that the British were surprised and had to scramble into action piecemeal. There was little higher control. The regimental officers simply formed their troops as best they could and placed them where they could tackle the great columns looming out of the fog, hoping that the old, tried, formula of desperate courage and superior musketry would prevail against sheer numbers.
The 49th was split from the first. On the left Colonel Dalton led a wing forward, and although he was killed almost immediately, the four companies continued to fight desperately under the inspired command of Major Grant, who time and time again led successful bayonet attacks against the Russians. Further over to the right, the other wing under Lieutenant Bellairs was also heavily engaged throughout the battle, and played a leading role in the fight around the Sandbag Battery. Bellairs, who with his three companies of the 49th including Sergeant Walters, was on the top of Home Ridge. Here the Russians had pushed up the slope to within sixty or eighty yards of the three companies, and were first seen through the mist among the brushwood at that distance. Bellairs at once gave the order to fix bayonets and advance. The men did so without firing a shot till they were within forty yards of the head of the enemy&#x27;s column, when with a cheer they charged. They were only about one hundred and eighty men, but the Russian column broke before their charge and fled, pursued by the fire of the 49th.

With the repulse of the Russian column near the Sandbag Battery by Brigadier-General Adams with the 41st, the first attack of twenty Russian battalions against the Home Ridge was beaten off. All this had occurred by 7.30 a.m.

General Pauloff was now bringing up his ten thousand Russian soldiers in the centre, and many more guns. Reinforcements were also coming up on the British side, but their numbers were very small compared with their assailants.

Brigadier-General Adams was now near the Sandbag Battery with the 41st, which was joined by Bellairs&#x27; companies of the 49th. On Adams&#x27; left there was a gap between the 49th companies and the British at the head of the Quarry Ravine. To support Adams, there were two battalions of Guards on the heights in the rear. But he had in front of him an enemy at least five times his strength and both his flanks were open and soon began to be turned. Here there continued a terrible fight in which the British defenders were so broken up into small groups that any detailed description seems impossible. Slowly the gallant seven hundred, whom Brigadier-General Adams commanded, were forced back on the heights to the rear.

During the course of this fierce encounter Brigadier-General Henry Adams CB had his horse killed under him, and as he was also wounded in the leg it seemed certain that he would be either captured or bayoneted by the Russians swarming around him. Very fortunately Sergeant George Walters of the 49th saw that his old commanding officer was in difficulties, and at once charged single-handed into the enemy surrounding the fallen general and drove them off with his bayonet. He then carried his officer back to comparative safety, and eventually he too received the Victoria Cross. Although Adam’s wound was in the ankle only, it became infected and killed him a few days later at Scutari in the notorious Barrack Hospital.

The Grenadier Guards, now coming down on the Sandbag Battery, charged with the bayonet and drove out the Russians. In the fight that ensued here, the remains of Lieutenant Bellairs&#x27; companies seem to have been inextricably mixed up. The Sandbag Battery was eventually abandoned for the higher ground behind, but it was again retaken by the Grenadier Guards. After his fight on the spur, on which stood the Sandbag Battery, Lieutenant Bellairs, with the remnants of his three companies, found himself at the head of the Quarry Ravine. Including scattered groups from other battalions, there were about one hundred and fifty men there. Somewhere about 9 a.m. they were preparing to resist the advance of a Russian column moving up the ravine against them when they received repeated orders, from an unidentified field officer, to retire and were compelled to do so, though Bellairs and other officers kept the retreat to a walk. Additions, as they retired, raised the 150 to 200 men. Presently, they found that they were retiring on the French 7th Leger, which was drawn up in good order. This battalion advanced at first, but never charged home and fell back again, the right of it in disorder.

Lieutenant Bellairs was now in rear of its left. The Russian advance here was broken, and the French line restored, by a charge of thirty men under Colonel Daubeny of the 55th directed on the right flank of the enemy column, the head of which was close under the final ascent to the Home Ridge. In repulsing this column, Bellairs appears to have taken his share with the 7th Leger in front. The time was about 9.15 a.m.

Beyond this point we find no further special mention of Lieutenant Bellairs&#x27; three companies, but it seems probable that they were again back at the &#x27;Barrier&#x27; at the head of the Quarry Ravine, where they remained holding their own whilst the principal fight raged on their right.

It was between noon and 1 p.m., when the tide had turned and the Russians were on the point of retreating beaten, when an attempt was decided on to advance with the British left against the Russian batteries on Shell Hill. The attack on the west flank of the batteries was led by the 77th and the battery there was only saved by the guns being carried off in time. At this moment, Captain J. W. Armstrong of the 49th, then on the staff, galloped up and urged forward all the troops he could find to support the 17th. Amongst them was a complete company of the 49th, under Lieutenant Astley, and this joined in the advance against the battery and the pursuit. The Russians now retreated unpursued, for the French, who had played but a poor part in this great day, declined to follow, and they were the only troops which were in a condition to do anything.

The losses of the 49th Regiment of Foot in the Battle of Inkermann were:- Killed: Major Dalton, Lieutenant and Adjutant A. S. Armstrong, 2 Sergeants, 1 Drummer, and 37 Rank and File. Wounded: Lieutenant Dewar (slightly), 9 Sergeants, 1 Drummer, 98 Rank and File.

In addition to these, it must be remembered the death of Brigadier-General Henry W. Adams, C.B. The whole battle was fought under conditions of such indescribable confusion that it is hardly possible to compile a detailed account of the part played by the 49th. Some indication is given by the fact that in seven hours fighting it lost over a hundred and fifty men, about a quarter of its effective strength.

In total the British lost about 2,400 troops, the French about 1,000 and the Russians an estimated 11,000. After Inkermann, the 49th returned to the duties of the siege. The Digest of Service is silent on the subject of privation and disease but everyone knows what the miseries of the army were in that first winter on the bleak heights of the Chersonese, with insufficient shelter and food, in great cold, and in such visitations as that of the great storm which devastated the crowded harbour of Balaklava on 14 November 1854. The only allusion in the Digest is a statement which shows that in the Crimean War the 49th Regiment of Foot lost 191 officers and men by disease, besides 178 invalided.
The 49th saw the Crimea War out to the end. It survived the first terrible winter on the plateau, not without heavy losses, and fought on in the trenches until eventually Sebastopol fell and the war ended. Even then it did not leave the theatre immediately, but spent a second winter there, although fortunately under conditions of luxury compared to those of the earlier one.

A royal warrant issued on 29 January 1856 founded the Victoria Cross. The warrant announced the creation of a single decoration available to the Army and Royal Navy, which was intended to reward &#x27;individual instances of merit and valour&#x27; and which &#x27;we are desirous should be highly prized and eagerly sought after&#x27;. The warrant laid down fifteen &#x27;rules and ordinances&#x27;. Essentially, the award was intended for extreme bravery in the presence of the enemy. It was also decided that the cross should be made from metal of little intrinsic value. It was intended that it should be bronze and cast from metal melted down from two cannon supposedly captured from the Russians at Sebastopol in the Crimean War.

On 8 September 1856 George married Mary Ann Norman at the Parish Church in Newport Pagnell. He was still a Sergeant in the 49th and gave his address as Newport Pagnell. His father James, the Innkeeper, was in attendance.

==Later life==
Shortly after the wedding, on 5 January 1857 George left the Army and joined the Metropolitan Police as Constable 444 of R Division. It was more than a year after the royal warrant was signed that the first awards of the VC were published in the London Gazette on 24 February 1857. The formal, rather stilted language of citations hardly ever conveys the violence, danger and sheer excitement of the actions, which win awards. George Walter&#x27;s deed was gazetted as follows:

On 21 June 1857, Mary Ann Walters gave birth to a son named James Isaac Walters. The Birth Certificate states that George Walters was now a Police Constable and they lived at 10 Lucas Street in Deptford, Kent.

The Queen made it plain to Lord Panmure that she herself wished to bestow her new award on as many of the recipients as possible. The 26 June 1857 was chosen by the Queen as a suitable day, and that a grand parade should be laid on in Hyde Park and that she would &#x27;herself&#x27; attend on horseback. The final list of recipients was not published in the London Gazette until 22 June, and Hancock&#x27;s had to work around the clock to engrave the names of the recipients on the Crosses. Those destined to receive the award had somehow to be found and rushed up to London, together with detachments of the units in which they had served. Queen Victoria caused some consternation by electing to stay on horseback throughout the ceremony of awarding the sixty-two recipients with the Cross. An extract in Queen Victoria’s Day Diary is as follows:


The Policeman was of course George Walters and George was the 51st person to receive the Victoria Cross. A total of 12 Victoria Cross medals were awarded to those who fought in the Battle of Inkermann.

The Times, on the following day published the following article:
Another leading article that day commented on the events. It found much to praise but complained about the lack of seats and cover for the public. It concluded with some damning criticism.

&quot;&quot;We have forgotten the Medal itself, or the Cross, rather, for such it is. Would we could forget it! Never did we see such a dull, heavy, tasteless affair. Much do we suspect that if it was on sale in any town in England at a penny a-piece, hardly a dozen would be sold in a twelve-month. There is a cross, and a lion, and a scroll or two worked up into the most shapeless mass that the size admits of. Valour must, and doubtless will, be still its own reward in this country, for the Victoria Cross is the shabbiest of all prizes&quot;.&quot;

Regardless, the Queen managed to pin on the whole batch in just ten minutes, which does not suggest lengthy conversation, but the whole parade went off extremely well to the rapturous applause of more than 4,000 troops and 12,000 spectators.

George resigned from the Metropolitan Police on 26 October 1857 under Certificate No. 4 (1 = Excellent, 2 = Very Good. 3 = Good, and 4 = Open, i.e. no comment). Maybe he left the Mets after such a short period in order to join the Regents Park Police and hence the fairly innocuous reference. No further record exists of George Walters until the 1871 English census. On 2 April 1871, George is shown as a visitor at North End, Newport Pagnell of the Maply family and his occupation is given as Park Keeper. Conversely, Mary Ann Walters is shown living at Lodge House, Park Crescent, Marylebone (the gatehouse to Regents Park) with sons James Isaac, aged 13, George, aged 12, and Ephraim Robert, aged 2. Mary gave her occupation as Park Constable’s wife. They are the only census records that record George Walters.

On 3 June 1872, George died at West Lodge, Park Crescent, Marylebone. In attendance was Dr. William Marsh of Harley Street Lodge. George had been suffering with Phthisis for three years, which literally means a wasting disease but almost invariably will mean pulmonary tuberculosis or any debilitating lung or throat affections, a severe cough, asthma. He was buried on 9 June 1872 in the City of Westminster Cemetery in Finchley.

==Burial==
Research was carried out in 1997 to track down the unidentified graves of VC winners. It seems that George Walters died in poverty and was buried in an unmarked pauper’s grave. His grave was found using cemetery records. In January 1998 a new gravestone was dedicated at a short but moving graveside ceremony, which was attended by members of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and Regimental Association including two pensioners from the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Inspector Paul Rason, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Museum, was also present to pay tribute to one of his own.

The new gravestone is engraved with the China Dragon of the Royal Berkshire Regiment and the Victoria Cross, and has the inscription &#x27;AT THIS PLACE LIE THE REMAINS OF SGT GEORGE WALTERS VC. 49TH REGIMENT OF FOOT. BORN 15 SEPT 1829. DIED 3 JUNE 1872. ERECTED BY HIS REGIMENT IN 1997 IN MEMORY OF A COURAGEOUS SOLDIER&#x27;

He lies in Plot 55 of Zone E10 at the renamed East Finchley Cemetery, London N2 0RZ.

Later a Commemorative Plaque was unveiled and a Memorial Panel displayed at the British Legion Newport Pagnell for &#x27;A GALLANT SON OF NEWPORT PAGNELL&#x27;.

==The medal==
George Walters&#x27; Victoria Cross is displayed at The Rifles (Berkshire and Wiltshire) Museum (Salisbury, Wiltshire, England) together with his Crimea Medal with three Clasps (Alma, Inkermann &amp; Sebestopol) and the Turkish Crimea Medal. They are not always on public display.

<text>Beurre noir (; ) is melted butter that is cooked over low heat until the milk solids turn a very dark brown. As soon as this happens, acid is carefully added to the hot butter, usually lemon juice or a type of vinegar. Some recipes also add a sprig of parsley, which is removed from the hot butter before the acid is added. It is typically served with eggs, fish, or certain types of vegetables. National Brown Butter day is held on September 22nd.

<text>Lieutenant Commander Malcolm David Wanklyn, (28 June 1911 – missing in action 14 April 1942) was a Royal Navy commander and one of the most successful submariners in the Western Allied navies during the Second World War. Wanklyn and his crew sank 16 enemy vessels.

Born in 1911 to an affluent family in Kolkata, British India, Wanklyn was influenced into a military career at a young age. His father was a successful businessman and engineer who served in the British Army in the First World War and his uncle was a destroyer commander who had a successful war fighting German U-boats in the First Battle of the Atlantic.

Wanklyn developed a seafaring interest at the age of five and applied to join the Royal Navy aged 14. Despite some physical ailments, he was able to pass the selection boards. He progressed as commissioned officer fairly quickly and by 1931 had been promoted to sub-lieutenant and lieutenant two years later in 1933. After serving on a variety of surface ships, he joined the submarine service.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Wanklyn was given command of which he commanded from February until August 1940. Wanklyn sailed on patrol in the North Sea, during which he sank one vessel. In August 1940 he was given command of newly commissioned . In December 1940 the submarine was reassigned to the Mediterranean. Wanklyn began the first of his patrols in January 1941 and remained on operations in the Battle of the Mediterranean for the remainder of his career.

During 15 months of operations, Wanklyn led &quot;Upholder&quot; on 27 patrols and sank 11 Axis merchant and troopships while damaging four more. During his combat career he fought many actions with &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Italian Navy) warships. He sank one destroyer and one minesweeper, and damaged a light cruiser. In a rare achievement, he also sank three Italian submarines. It amounted to 128,353 tons of enemy shipping. For the sinking of the heavily defended enemy transport SS &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; without working Asdic, he received the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be bestowed upon personnel in the British and Commonwealth forces.

On 14 April 1942, while on his 28th patrol, Wanklyn and his crew disappeared. He was posted missing in action. His exact fate remains unknown. Research suggests &quot;Upholder&quot; was sunk by a combination of an Italian warship and German aircraft. In 1986 the Royal Navy launched another submarine of the same name. The Upholder/Victoria-class submarine HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; served until 1994 when it was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;. It remains operational.

==Early life and family==
David Wanklyn&#x27;s parents were William Lumb Wanklyn and Marjorie Wanklyn. His father was English and his mother&#x27;s parents were Irish. As a young man Wanklyn preferred to be thought of as Scottish. He spent his formative years in Scotland and developed a close affinity for the country and people. He learned to shoot and practice his fishing skills while living there.

Wanklyn&#x27;s father was born in Argentina and brought up in Ayrshire, Scotland. His ancestors had moved to Argentina in the 19th century. His maternal grandfather was managing director of the Mercantile Bank of the River Plate until its collapse in 1875. His grandfather, Frederick, died soon afterwards and his grandmother Elizabeth discovered his estate had been mismanaged. Left destitute, she headed back to England with her eight children including William. Ill-fortune struck again during their return when the vessel in which they were travelling, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, &quot;Boyne&quot;, ran aground on Friday 13 August on the rocks off the Isle of Molene, near Brest, France. The family lost most of their belongings.

With little money, his mother sent William to one of the family&#x27;s many connections. He was adopted by a wealthy Manchester businessman who relocated him to the family&#x27;s Ayrshire residence. He attended Marlborough College and qualified as an engineer. He married Marjorie Josephine Rawson in 1906. At 21 she was 14 years his junior. Eventually they moved to India. William was appointed chief engineer of the Port Engineering Company based near Calcutta. During this time they travelled around the Far East and North America generating business contacts.

On 28 June 1911 their third son, Malcolm &quot;David&quot; Wanklyn was born in Kolkata, India. He had two brothers Peter (b. 1907), Patrick (b. 1915), and two sisters, Nancy (b. 1917—died of meningitis on her first birthday) and Nancy (b. 1924). The Wanklyns quickly became wealthy and by the time of David&#x27;s birth they were at the height of their material and social success. In 1911 they were invited to the Delhi Durbar, attended by King George V and Queen Mary.

When the First World War broke out in 1914 William Wanklyn joined the Calcutta Light Horse. He served on the Western Front until 1915 when he returned home to the commissioned officer rank of major in the Royal Engineers. When he was only six, David Wanklyn became enamoured with the sea. At this age he first met his uncle, his mother&#x27;s brother. Lieutenant Alec Anderson was serving in the Royal Navy. He had commanded a destroyer, and during a convoy escort operation he had rammed and sunk a German U-boat off the coast of Ireland. His crippled ship was towed into Newport for repairs, and he used the opportunity to visit his sister and nephew in Scotland. The meeting had a profound effect upon David, who was deeply impressed by his exploits. Alec survived the war, but not the 1918 flu pandemic.

Wanklyn became a keen sailor and angler and was particularly fond of shooting. He was also an accomplished musician. In his teenage years, his uncle&#x27;s stories were still vivid and Wanklyn&#x27;s desires still lay with a naval career. He attended Parkfield Preparatory School in Haywards Heath, Sussex. Academically he excelled, although he was shy and a loner, and had a propensity to avoid team games. Nevertheless, his intellectual approach to his studies won him respect amongst his fellow students and made him a popular individual.

==Royal Navy==
In 1925 he applied to join the Royal Navy. During the selection board process it was discovered he was colour blind. This congenital disorder would normally have ended his career. Fortunately the chief medical officer was a patient man and coached him to differentiate between what he was seeing and what was a congenital illusion. He passed the written examinations and negotiated the Admiralty Interview Board. In 1925, he entered Dartmouth Naval College.

He was assigned as a midshipman on 1 May 1929 after finishing top of his class in five subjects. In 1930 he was assigned to the battleship &quot;Marlborough&quot;, part of the Third Battle Squadron; and the following year to the battlecruiser in September 1931 on which he served with fellow midshipman, and future vice admiral, Peter Gretton. While serving in the ship, Wanklyn was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant, the equivalent of an army second lieutenant. He was promoted sub-lieutenant on 1 January 1932. Soon afterwards he moved to the naval gunnery school—HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;—at Whale Island, Portsmouth to learn more about naval navigation to qualify for his second ring at the rank of lieutenant. In February 1933 he moved to HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; and was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1933.

===Submarine service===
After attending promotion courses in 1932 he joined the Royal Navy Submarine Service the following spring, 1933. He served at Gosport and undertook intensive training on submarines. In September he served in the submarine which was part of the Mediterranean Fleet. It was his first appointment as a submariner. In 1934 he accompanied his new post on trips around the Mediterranean. Visits to Gibraltar, Malta, Algeria, France and Italy followed. In October 1934 he transferred to HMS &quot;L56&quot; based with the rest of the 6th Submarine Flotilla at Portsmouth. Wanklyn spent a year on board before becoming the boat&#x27;s first lieutenant. He learned a number of officer functions and was responsible for the vessel&#x27;s diving trim and crew discipline. He would recall the performance of the L-class submarine when he commanded other such vessels in early 1940. He served aboard HMS &quot;Shark&quot; for the majority of 1937 and 1938 and became her first lieutenant.

He patrolled around Gibraltar during the Spanish Civil War. Admiralty orders dictated any Nationalist or Spanish Republican Navy vessel that attempted to attack British shipping was to be sunk on sight. On one occasion, the submarine encountered a German U-boat. The two submarines watched each other from a distance of without taking action. While based at Malta Wanklyn married his girlfriend Betty at the Holy Trinity Church, Sliema, on 5 May 1938. Wanklyn invited all the officers and men who formed a guard of honour. It was not usual for officers to mix with lower ranks but Wanklyn showed no prejudice.

Wanklyn returned to Gosport in July 1939 and became the first lieutenant and second-in-command of HMS &quot;Otway&quot;, part of the 5th Submarine Flotilla, in August 1939. The submarine left Gosport on 24 August 1939 and sailed to Gibraltar to take on fuel and supplies. At the outbreak of war Wanklyn was deployed to Malta on 2 September and then to Alexandria in Egypt on 2 October 1939. Over the course of the Phoney War, &quot;Otway&quot; was in training. On Christmas Day the vessel docked in Marseilles. Wanklyn was ordered to London to receive a new command. He was driven to Paris, where he spent boxing day and then on to Cherbourg, where he sailed for England.

==Second World War==
Wanklyn was then appointed as the commanding officer of HMS &quot;H31&quot; on 5 February 1940. &quot;H32&quot; conducted several exercises throughout the next few months and refitted in April. By July 1940 the situation had worsened for the Royal Navy. On 14 May the Dutch capitulated. Belgium surrendered on 28 May and France collapsed on 22 June 1940. Some 14 submarines had been lost and the British Army evacuated from Norway in the same month. It left the navy defending British waters against a hostile coastline which ran from northern Norway to the French Atlantic Ocean coast. The Royal Navy prepared itself for a possible German invasion of Britain should the Royal Air Force fail in the Battle of Britain. It was also busy defending sea communications in the English Channel—during the &quot;Kanalkampf&quot;—and the Battle of the Atlantic.

===North Sea operations===
To exert pressure on German naval forces Wanklyn undertook a patrol on 14 July. On 18 July he arrived off the Dutch coast. North of Terschelling Island he sighted three anti-submarine trawlers in formation. After spending an hour closing on the vessels he launched a single torpedo at 07:37, from a range of , on a 125 degree track angle to bring all the ships nearly in line with the torpedo and maximise a chance of a hit. He heard the torpedo through the hydrophones. Two minutes later there was an explosion and the German submarine chaser &quot;UJ-126&quot; sank. For the next thirty minutes eight depth charges were directed at the submarine, the nearest detonating away, before the enemy gave up and retired eastward. A curt statement in his report marked the victory: &quot;The behaviour of the crew was most satisfactory.&quot;

Wanklyn returned to port in Blyth. His success was to be rewarded in August 1940. Wanklyn was relocated to the north-west, to Barrow-in-Furness, where he was presented with the command of , which was then under construction. He commanded her for the remainder of the war. &quot;Upholder&quot; was a U-class submarine equipped with four internal and two external torpedo tubes. These were supplemented by a 76 mm QF 3-inch 20 cwt deck gun. She was laid down on 30 October 1939 and launched in July 1940. Wanklyn took command just as she was completed and watched over the ship during her construction. The vessel was long with a beam of . Her surface speed was and submerged could reach . She could dive to periscope depth in 45 seconds.

After a five-month fitting-out and sea trial phase she was declared battle ready. Wanklyn sailed for the Mediterranean Theatre on 10 December 1940. The vessel docked at Gibraltar before deploying for Malta. The entry of Italy into the war on 10 June 1940 had made the region a war zone. The Italian Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) and Italian Air Force (&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;) laid siege to the island. In September 1940 the Italian invasion of Egypt began a major land campaign. The objective of British submarine forces was to prevent the large Italian merchant fleets from supplying the Italian Army, and later the German Afrika Korps, in North Africa. Wanklyn now formed part of the 10th Submarine Flotilla in Malta under the command of Commander George Simpson. &quot;Upholder&quot; arrived there on 14 January 1941. While journeying to Malta, he provided distant cover for the supply fleet Operation Excess.

===Mediterranean===
Wanklyn&#x27;s first success in this theatre was an attack on a large ship escorted by a destroyer heading to port in Tripoli. At 01:30 on 26 January 1941 he began his attack surfaced. He evaded the destroyer, but both torpedoes missed. Later another convoy was sighted and he fired two torpedoes but once again, both missed. On 28 January 1941 Wanklyn&#x27;s lookouts sighted another convoy. Closing undetected to , he scored one hit on the 7,500-ton transport &quot;Duisburg&quot;, which was damaged. On 30 January 1941 he fired two torpedoes at a northbound convoy and claimed a hit on a 5,000-ton cargo ship which has not been confirmed. Having expended all of his torpedoes, &quot;Upholder&quot; berthed in Malta on 1 February. He was promoted lieutenant commander on 1 February 1941.

Wanklyn was back at sea on 12 February 1941. In the dark, lookouts sighted a submarine and Wanklyn ordered an attack. After realising it was a British vessel from its silhouette, the attack was aborted. It was later discovered the submarine had been the British T-class submarine . Ten days later, on 22 February, restrictions on British submarines were lifted and shipping in the entire Mediterranean Sea was considered fair game and to be sunk on sight.

On 10 March, a convoy of small ships &#x27;in ballast&#x27; was sighted off Tripoli. Conscious of the shortage of torpedoes he held fire. While on his fourth patrol, on 3 April 1941, he sighted a convoy but the ships were at extreme range. On 10 April, a second attack went wrong when his torpedoes&#x27; tracks were seen and the convoy took evasive action. &quot;Upholder&quot; was subjected to a sustained counter-attack and was then forced to crash-dive deep when the hydrophones detected a torpedo closing on the vessel. Rather than give up, Wanklyn decided to reconnoitre convoys. On the 12 April 1941 he sighted five large ships with three destroyers. He surfaced to broadcast their position to Malta headquarters, but an enemy aircraft spotted him and &quot;Upholder&quot; was forced to dive. Later, Wanklyn repeated the procedure which was acknowledged. He fired a star shell over the convoy to mark its position and the enemy fleet quickly reversed direction to port. It attracted the 14th Destroyer Flotilla, comprising , , and . The force did not make contact that night. Days later, during the Battle of the Tarigo Convoy, the same tactics allowed other submarines to lead the force to devastate an Italian convoy for the loss of one destroyer.

In early April, British naval intelligence received a report that Albert Kesselring, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German air force) commander-in-chief for the Mediterranean, was setting up his headquarters at the Miramar Hotel in Taormina in Sicily. Simpson selected Wanklyn and &quot;Upholder&quot; for an operation to land commandos onto enemy-held coastland for an assassination attempt against Kesselring. The town lay from a rocky coast cut into a hill side in the middle of an oil grove. &quot;Upholder&quot; was fitted with a fender to protect the hull from the rocks. 23 commandos were to be landed. They would destroy the hotel and its occupants with explosive and gunfire. Wanklyn gave them 40 minutes to complete the attack and return to the submarine under the cover of the deck gun. The day before the operation it was postponed, and submarines were deployed to intercept a convoy from Naples. Two weeks later intelligence reported Kesselring had left the area and the operation was abandoned.

Simpson received a report from naval intelligence that two enemy cruisers and destroyers were leaving port in Sicily to rendezvous with a convoy south of Kerkennah Islands. Wanklyn was ordered to remain off the island of Lampedusa, midway between Malta and Tunisia. Nothing was seen, so Wanklyn sailed to the Tunisian coast and selected an area well known for its convoy traffic. On 25 April Wanklyn spotted a merchant ship and its armed trawler escort but managed to close to undetected before firing two torpedoes. The ship was hit and sank. It was later identified as the small merchant vessel &quot;Antonietta Lauro&quot;, which was loaded with nitrates bound for Italy. She sank slowly, and went under after six hours.

The following day, 26 April, he spotted two ships that had run aground. He waited for darkness so that he could escape under cover, and closed on the merchant and its destroyer escort, hoping to torpedo both. As he closed to eliminate the destroyer first he ran aground in of water. Unable to risk torpedoes in such shallow water, he moved alongside the transport, which had been heavily damaged in an attack and appeared to be deserted, with no live personnel on board. The deck was covered in motorcycles, cars and trucks earmarked for the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;. Wanklyn ordered a boarding party to loot whatever they could and lay scuttling charges, which blew up the ship. He elected to leave the destroyer, which lay in much shallower water, until the following day. Wanklyn ran aground again and was forced to abandon the attack, returning to base with &quot;Arta&quot; as his solitary kill.

In North Africa, German forces had gone onto the offensive in Operation Sonnenblume. By late April British Army forces were being forced out of Libya and Tobruk was surrounded. Simpson ordered his submarines to intercept convoys sailing from Naples and delivering supplies to the Axis armies in Africa. To assist, Horton formed the 5th Destroyer Flotilla with the light cruiser &quot;Gloucester&quot; as support. Simpson sent &quot;Upholder&quot;, &quot;Ursula&quot; and &quot;Upright&quot;. Simpson ordered his submarines into action on 27 April and 1 May. On 1 May 1941, &quot;Upholder&quot; and &quot;Ursula&quot; gained contact with a convoy, but the ships were travelling too fast to close to effective range. Six hours later he spotted five transports with four destroyers conducting zig-zagging courses to avoid underwater attacks. The water was rough but Wanklyn fired a three-torpedo salvo at the two largest, overlapping, vessels. Three explosions were heard. The German liner &quot;Leverkusen&quot;, which had been hit twice, sank by the stern. The third torpedo had stopped &quot;Arcturus&quot;, which was listing heavily by the bow. The enemy delivered a moderate counter-attack and sped off. Wanklyn used his final two torpedoes to sink the damaged vessel. The tanker &quot;Bainsizza&quot; was also hit by &quot;Upholder&quot; and sank immediately. The patrol yielded three ships of around 19,000 tons. Simpson immediately recommended Wanklyn and his officers for awards.

===Leading submariner===
Wanklyn did not partake in social activities excessively. When he returned to shore he spent 24 hours discussing his patrol report with Simpson and checking over preparations for the next sortie. Wanklyn did this immediately, as no commander knew when he would be called into action again. The toll and strain of operations prompted Simpson to send his commanders into the country to relax when there was a lull in operations. Wanklyn&#x27;s letters to his wife usually carried the address of San Anton Palace, where he became the frequent guest of the governor General Sir William Dobbie. To release his stress Wanklyn tended to his pig farm and occasionally did some shooting but submariner&#x27;s greatest hobby was fishing. Although somewhat austere, Wanklyn did play the guitar and drank socially, realising his need to bond with the officers and crew. He did not join in with organised parties, because he was tired and physically drained much of the time.

Wanklyn was called into action again on 15 May 1941. &quot;Unique&quot; had reported five cruisers and smaller craft convoying in the Straits of Messina. Simpson considered &quot;Upholder″s&quot; presence beneficial. Wanklyn set course for the convoy route to Benghazi and then towards Messina to maximise his chance of catching an enemy ship. Bad luck plagued the early part of the mission. A torpedo leaked and had to be reloaded submerged. A convoy was sighted but was too close to shore and could not be brought within range. &quot;Upholder″s&quot; Asdic had been knocked out. A faulty washer let in sea water which destroyed the insulation around an electrical cable. A signal arrived in the afternoon informing him of a convoy near Patras. Wanklyn&#x27;s look outs spotted it—a tramp steamer, two tankers and a corvette, barely visible against the backdrop of the coastline. Wanklyn fired three torpedoes at . One explosion was heard. Minutes later two more were heard but Wanklyn assumed they had struck shore. A 4,000-ton tanker was claimed damaged. Six depth charges were dropped but missed, roughly by . On 22 May an Italian hospital ship was allowed to pass by without an attack.

On 23 May he spotted a convoy of two tankers. Looking through the periscope he saw that one ship carried French colours, and consulted his identification books to determine her identify. The crew identified the name on her hull—&quot;Damieni&quot;. The second ship was called &quot;Alberta&quot;. There was no intelligence of neutral shipping in the area and both ships sounded Italian. After some thought, Wanklyn attacked. Three torpedoes were fired and &quot;Capitaine Damiani&quot;, a Vichy French vessel travelling under Italian charter, sank by the stern roughly south-west of Punta di Pellaro. &quot;Alberta&quot; carried out evasive action and the escorting vessels dropped 26 depth charges and hunted &quot;Upholder&quot; all afternoon. The following afternoon a further 21 were dropped. None came close. With no Asdic, Wanklyn dived to , as he could not easily determine enemy movements. The enemy abandoned the attacks and at dusk &quot;Upholder&quot; surfaced.

As it grew dark, lookouts spotted a large ship with five destroyers. The Italian liner-turned troopship SS &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; was identified by periscope. As he moved to attack he was nearly rammed by the destroyer &quot;Freccia&quot; which had not seen the submarine. He fired his torpedoes and dived to . He heard two explosions and the ship, carrying the flag of Rear Admiral Francesco Canzoneri, sank with 2,279 soldiers and crew on board roughly 50 km (27 nm) east of Portopalo di Capo Passero in Sicily. Around 1,300 of these men died. Over the next hours he evaded 37 depth charges as the escort counter-attacked. Several days later, one of life boats from the &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; was found wrecked upon Malta and the sinking was confirmed. The sinking of the 19,000-ton ship, which was under heavy guard, and without working Asdic, prompted the award of the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for bravery and skill in the face of the enemy. Wanklyn was gazetted for his actions on 1 December 1941.

The strain of operations was already showing and commander Simpson ordered Wanklyn to be taken off patrols. Simpson could not spare his crew and they were not afforded the same respite. Wanklyn was now one of the most successful submarine commanders on the Allied side and Simpson was anxious to rest him. While off combat duty, Wanklyn lectured and tutored new officers if he was asked, but preferred not to force junior commanders to listen to his experiences. Simpson did not want to expose &quot;Upholder&quot; to undue risk in his absence, and the submarine was allotted the Messina to Tripoli route, rather than allowing it to conduct operations close to the enemy shore. In Wanklyn&#x27;s absence, a new 27-year-old commander, Arthur Hezlet, took over from him. Hezlet was an aggressive commander and Simpson made sure to send the vessel somewhere he could not get the crew into trouble, so that they would be returned to Wanklyn intact. Only a German hospital ship came across his path during the single June 1941 patrol, and he was forced to let it go.

&quot;Upholder&quot; and &quot;Unbeaten&quot; were ordered by Simpson to sail again on 24 June. A convoy of four liners was sailing from Naples to Tripoli. Wanklyn took a position to the west in error. Hydrophones picked up the convoys propeller noises and occasional depth charges but saw nothing. The boat was recalled and arrived in Malta on 27 June, making this her shortest patrol. It was the first patrol in many that Wanklyn could not fly the Jolly Roger to denote a kill. During these patrols, &quot;Upholder&quot; hosted war correspondent and future actor Commander Anthony Kimmins. Kimmins contributed an article to &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine, which was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 20 February 1942.

===Summer 1941===
Wanklyn was ordered to depart again on 30 June 1941 to patrol the southern Straits of Messina. Within twenty-four hours he had spotted a liner. &quot;Upholder&quot; closed to very close range and fired three torpedoes, but the skilful seamanship of the Italian captain avoided the torpedoes by zig-zagging. Wanklyn concluded that the torpedoes had probably passed under the ship. The next two days were spent avoiding two destroyers, which were clearing a way for an oncoming convoy. On 3 July, Wanklyn&#x27;s patience was rewarded when a 4,000-ton tanker hove into view. He pursued it as it hugged the coastline but was forced to break off as it changed course around Capo dell&#x27;Armi. While in the vicinity of Cape Spartivento, three hours later, he spotted three ships escorted by one destroyer. The escort suddenly dropped a depth charge and turned straight towards &quot;Upholder&quot;. Wanklyn dived the submarine to and climbed to periscope depth when he could hear the destroyer passing off to the west. He engaged a grey cargo vessel laden with wooden packing cases. Two explosions were heard and distress signals identified her as &quot;Laura C&quot;. The destroyer dropped 19 depth charges, which shattered light bulbs and came close to damaging the submarine. Later, a submarine chaser dropped 27 depth charges wide of the target. &quot;Upholder&quot; withdrew to Malta on the 8 July.

On 19 July &quot;Upholder&quot; left harbour once more, to take part in Operation Substance, which was a supply operation to deliver a much-needed convoy to the island. Wanklyn was moved to guard the south island of Marettimo. Two days later Wanklyn moved to San Vito Lo Capo, on the western tip of Sicily. There, he could cover enemy movements from Palermo. On 24 July he spotted and engaged a transport with a single destroyer escort. He dived and fired three torpedoes at , one of which struck and his victim, the 5,000-ton &quot;Dandolo&quot; sank. The destroyer dropped 17 depth charges over two hours and attempted a hydrophone hunt, but Wanklyn dived to and retired to the north-west. His score now stood at 67,000 tons of enemy shipping sunk.

On 28 July, while in thick fog north of Marettimo, Wanklyn&#x27;s spotters saw two cruisers supported by destroyers. The escorts were zig-zagging on either side while the cruiser maintained a steady course. It was identified as the &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot;, travelling at high speed—the asdic gave a reading of 230 revs indicating . Wanklyn had to think quickly if he was not to miss his chance. At he fired a spread of four Mark IV torpedoes at 12-second intervals. The submarine dived and the crew clearly heard two explosions. The &quot;Garibaldi&quot; stopped as her escorts created a smoke screen and dropped depth charges for 45 minutes. The officers of &quot;Upholder&quot; counted 38. The presence of the escorts and smoke denied the British the chance to assess the results of the attack. &quot;Upholder&quot; returned to Malta and learned that the operation had been a success.

As the summer progressed, British submariners had noticed how vulnerable Italian coastal railway networks were. On 15 August 1941 Wanklyn and &quot;Upholder&quot; sailed to the Marittimo area with the hope of landing saboteurs—or train wrecking parties—along the coast to plant explosives along coastal railways. British submarines were now carrying out these operations regularly. Over the closing months of 1941, 12 such operations were carried out. On one occasion a submarine surfaced and shot up a locomotive with its deck gun. Once in the area, Wanklyn was directed onto two convoys and missed them both. On 20 August he moved to the Cape of St Vito. After breakfast he sighted a small cargo vessel and a trawler. Wanklyn ordered two torpedoes fired, one of which hit. The vessel—&quot;Enotria&quot;—staggered under the blow and sank. The trawler hastily unloaded depth charges and retreated to the west in the direction of Trapani. Wanklyn followed and observed the port under air attack.

Wanklyn moved &quot;Upholder&quot; back to the Marettimo area. On the afternoon of 22 August lookouts sighted three tankers under escort from three destroyers and a flying boat. Wanklyn targeted the lead ship as the aircraft moved off to the disengaged side of the convoy and the destroyer nearest to him was moving to cover the rear of the convoy. The tanker carried three large drums on its deck and was painted in mauve and khaki dazzle camouflage. Wanklyn ordered a full salvo. Two torpedoes struck the target, the &quot;Lussin&quot;, which sank with heavy loss of life. Wanklyn noted that the destroyers dropped 43 depth charges in eight minutes, followed by a further 18. The tactics of the Italians were improving. At one point, &quot;Upholder&quot; was trapped in between two destroyers. Wanklyn believed they were saved because the Italians began their attack at excessive speeds causing them to overshoot by . On 24 August Wanklyn attacked a convoy of ships which included six destroyers two cruisers and a . At he could not catch the smaller ships but fired his last two torpedoes at a cruiser. The officers heard one explosion and claimed a cruiser damaged. The escort launched 32 depth charges, some of which came close to &quot;Upholder&quot;.

The following day Wanklyn dropped a raiding party inland near Palermo. The party failed to find a target and returned after a few skirmishes with Italian patrols. On the way in, &quot;Upholder&quot; scraped the sea bed and Wanklyn moved the submarine out. While there he was spotted and experienced fire from the shore. The party returned without loss, having failed in their mission to find a target, and the submarine quickly departed. The risk of being attacked by Italian motor torpedo boats was very high. &quot;Urge&quot; had better success, when she landed a party that blew up a supply bridge near Taormina. Another unsuccessful patrol followed—their 13th—and they returned on 1 September 1941. During the sortie he engaged the three huge liner-transports &quot;Neptunia&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot; and &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. He fired all of his torpedoes and all missed and once again &quot;Upholder&quot; was subjected to counter-attacks. Just 17 days later, Wanklyn would engage two of these vessels again.

===&quot;Neptunia&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot;, &quot;Duisburg&quot; convoy===
The day following their return—2 September 1941—several of the crew received awards. Wanklyn received the Distinguished Service Order. The Victoria Cross award for his sinking of &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; had not been publicly announced. The &quot;London Gazette&quot; published the exploits of Wanklyn and he became a well-known figure in Britain and the men were given two weeks leave on Malta. Simpson summoned all of his commanding officers to his harbour headquarters. &quot;Upholder&quot;, &quot;Upright&quot;, &quot;Ursula&quot; and &quot;Unbeaten&quot; were to patrol the Tripoli sea lanes and intercept the convoy Wanklyn had failed to intercept two weeks earlier. On 16 September &quot;Upholder&quot; departed Malta. At 3 a.m on the morning of 18 September 1941, Wanklyn received a message from &quot;Unbeaten&quot;, which had spotted the convoy.

At night as the liners were illuminated by the moon, Wanklyn attacked with four torpedoes. The submarine could only manage and a swell was rocking her from side to side, making aiming difficult. It was too dark to begin a submerged attack against a fast-moving convoy. Wanklyn deduced that the attack must be made at long range, outside the escorts&#x27; protective screen. Wanklyn saw that on occasion the targets overlapped, and as they did so he fired at the bow of one and stern of the other. Bringing back the aiming point to the centre of the overlapping mass, he fired two more torpedoes. Two torpedoes struck. The first destroyed the propellers of the &quot;Oceania&quot; and she stopped dead in the water. The other struck and tore a large hole in &quot;Neptunia&quot;. The escorts stopped to pick up survivors. Wanklyn retired to a safe distance and reloaded. Closing to finish the crippled &quot;Oceania&quot;, Wanklyn was forced to crash-dive because of an Italian destroyer. Too close to fire, he continued under the liner and emerged on the other side. There he fired a single torpedo which blew the ship apart and it sank. &quot;Unbeaten&quot; had arrived and was about to fire but saw the second strike disintegrate the ship, which was carrying several thousand German soldiers. &quot;Neptunia&quot; limped off with a destroyer at but her bulkheads collapsed due to the damage and she came to a stop with a single destroyer in attendance. Two more torpedoes from &quot;Upholder&quot; sank her. Wanklyn had accounted for nearly 40,000 tons in the same attack. The gyro-compass had been put out of action during the action.

&quot;Upholder&quot; experienced a barren run over the next few weeks. Her next patrol, between 23 September and 2 October, was north of Marittimo and stretching to Cape St Vito. Two weeks later, in mid-October 1941, the boat operated with &quot;Urge&quot; in the Kerkenah Bank off Tunisia. On the night of 8 November 1941, lookouts spotted a U-boat in the moonlight off Melito di Porto Salvo. Wanklyn determined it was Italian, possibly a &quot;Perla&quot;, &quot;Sirena&quot; or &quot;Argonauta&quot;-class submarine. A full salvo sank the vessel. No survivors were recovered, and only a large oil slick was visible on the surface. &quot;Upholder&quot; picked up the noise of the enemy vessel breaking apart as it sank.

Just 36 hours later, Wanklyn witnessed the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. Captain William Gladstone Agnew led Force K—a flotilla of several destroyers—into a surface battle. Speeding up to attack any stragglers, Wanklyn engaged and sank the Italian &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class destroyer &quot;Libeccio&quot;. Wanklyn attempted to engage a cruiser but hit an &quot;Avieri&quot;–class destroyer, which he claimed damaged. During the battle the gyro failed on one of the &quot;Upholder&quot; torpedoes, which ran in circles and came close to the &quot;Upholder&quot; before sinking.

===Last patrols===
On 25 November 1941 &quot;Upholder&quot; left for her eighteenth patrol. Wanklyn positioned the submarine south east of the Messina straits. At 07:30 on the 27 November they sighted a large tanker with destroyers for escort. Wanklyn fired a full salvo at but underestimated the enemy&#x27;s speed. This convoy was later intercepted, and the tanker sunk, by Force K. On 29 November &quot;Upholder&quot; sailed into the midst of an Italian naval squadron on a night exercise. The enemy fleet consisted of three cruisers and five destroyers. With the closest vessel only away Wanklyn continued to calculate the bearing and speed of the enemy, until eventually he ordered the boat to dive. He could not see anything through the periscope in the winter night. By using dead-reckoning, he fired off a salvo at the last ship using his asdic. The target disappeared on a reciprocal bearing and then reappeared right over the top of &quot;Upholder&quot;. Wanklyn docked at Malta on the morning of 21 December 1941.

In Wankln&#x27;s absence, the BBC had broadcast news of the Victoria Cross award on 11 December. Wanklyn&#x27;s wife and son, Ian, were presented with the award at the home of her parents in Meigle. Her husband&#x27;s achievements and records came as shock since all his letters were censored for security reasons. Many newspapers used his picture and interview with the &quot;Times of Malta&quot;, made earlier in the year, to draw on his account of the sea war. Wanklyn&#x27;s reserved nature permitted him only to say that he was &quot;exhilarated&quot; by the news. When asked what was most needed in submarine warfare for success, he replied, &quot;That&#x27;s a nasty one, so I will use a long word: Imperturbability&quot;. Wanklyn only became expansive in describing the crew&#x27;s debt to their cook, an able seaman, who was essential for the crew&#x27;s welfare. The award was the seventh to be bestowed upon a member of the navy, but the first to the submarine service.

On 31 December Wanlyn put to sea again. He fired three torpedoes at a merchant ship off Cape Gallo but all missed and one exploded upon hitting the shore. West of Palermo on 4 January 1942, &quot;Upholder&quot; engaged the Italian merchant &quot;Sirio&quot;. The first two torpedoes failed, and one fell to the sea bed and exploded under &quot;Upholder&quot; causing no serious damage. Closing to , Wanklyn ordered two more firings. One torpedo struck amidships. The heavily damaged vessel stopped to lower some lifeboats, but then continued on. Wanklyn surfaced to destroy her with the deck gun but was forced under again when the ship returned fire with deck armament. &quot;Sirio&quot; soon picked up speed and escaped. The following night off Messina, Wanklyn attacked an enemy submarine with his last torpedo. His victim, the &quot;Ammiraglio Saint&quot;, was lost. The men standing on the conning tower survived: Lieutenant Como, Petty Officer and Telegraphist Valentino Chico and Torpedoman Ernst Fiore. They were willing to identify their boat to their captors and described their vessel as a 1,500 ton submarine. Wanklyn made for port. On the journey the submarine was attacked by Junkers Ju 88s which landed bombs off the vessel&#x27;s starboard quarter. Once docked, Wanklyn was ordered on a months leave. Commander Pat Norman took command of her for a patrol during which he sank the armed trawler &quot;Aosta&quot; on 8 February.

On 21 February 1942 Wanklyn took command again. Simpson ordered her to participate in operations of the Libyan coast. On the morning of 23 February, &quot;Upholder&quot; took up her position off Misurata. Wanklyn pursued two ships until he realised they were destroyers. On 26 February &quot;Upholder&quot; picked up a contact of Sidi Blal. He closed to attack on the surface before appreciating his error—his quarry was another destroyer. Wanklyn ordered the boat to dive. Apparently they had sailed so close Wanklyn saw the sparkle of a cigarette thrown from the destroyer. Off Tripoli &quot;Upholder&quot; intercepted the transport &quot;Tembien&quot; and her single destroyer escort. Wanklyn ordered three torpedoes fired and three hit. The cargo ship sank in twenty minutes. From 28 February—3 March, no more vessels were encountered and Wanklyn docked in Malta on 5 March. &quot;Tembien&quot; was carrying 468 Allied prisoners of war, a fact known to the British through Ultra decryptions. Her sinking caused the deaths of at least 390 prisoners and 78 crew and guards.

On 14 March 1942, Wanlyn departed on his 27th patrol in the Gulf of Taranto. On the night of the 18 March he sighted a submarine on the surface and determined her to be hostile. He engaged with a full spread of torpedoes, and the submarine blew apart and sank. The submarine, later identified as the &quot;Tricheco&quot;, was lost with all hands. There was no counterattack, but motor torpedo boats shadowed her movements for hours which ran down her battery and oxygen. The following day Wanklyn moved to St Cataldo Point hoping to find a softer target for his deck gun. The lookouts sighted four vessels, a trawler and three fishing smacks. Wanklyn ordered the submarine to surface from the trawler, &quot;Maria&quot;. His officers gestured to the crew to abandon ship and &quot;Upholder&quot; fired seven shells into the vessel which sank. The smacks fled close to shore. The action had lasted 14 minutes and Wanklyn decided it was too dangerous to give chase. On 23 March &quot;Upholder&quot;, &quot;Proteus&quot; and &quot;P36&quot; loitered off Taranto in the hope of engaging Italian warships. One convoy was sighted and Wanklyn fired on a light cruiser but missed. All three returned to Malta without success.

==Death==
Wanklyn is believed to have been killed along with his crew when &quot;Upholder&quot; was lost on her 25th patrol, becoming overdue on 14 April 1942. The most likely explanation is that she fell victim to depth charges dropped by the Italian torpedo boat &quot;Pegaso&quot; north east of Tripoli on 14 April 1942, although no debris was seen on the surface. The attack was away from Wanklyn&#x27;s patrol area; it is thought that he may have changed position to find more targets. It is also possible that the submarine was sunk by a mine on 11 April 1942 near Tripoli, when a submarine was reported as approaching a minefield. More recent research carried out by Italian naval specialist Francesco Mattesini points to a German aerial patrol supporting the same convoy, composed of two Dornier Do 17s and two Messerschmitt Bf 110s, which attacked an underwater contact with bombs two hours before the &quot;Pegaso&quot; incident. The author also asserts that the seaplane crew was unsure if the target they pinpointed to &quot;Pegaso&quot; was a submarine or a school of dolphins. Mattesini, however, admits the possibility that &quot;Pegaso&quot; could have finished off the submarine previously damaged by the German aircraft. Wanklyn was the Allies&#x27; most successful submariner in terms of tonnage sunk.

<text>Foreign Objects is a Canadian television series which aired on CBC Television in 2001. A short-run dramatic anthology series, the series was written and produced by Ken Finkleman.

Finkleman stars as documentary producer George Findlay, the same character he plays in his earlier series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, &quot;More Tears&quot; and &quot;Foolish Heart&quot;. Apart from Findlay, each episode focuses on a different set of characters and tells a self-contained story based on themes of human frailty and obsession. The show&#x27;s other main recurring character is Tibor (Colm Feore), a European acquaintance of Findlay&#x27;s who is involved in drawing Findlay to the various settings in which the show&#x27;s events take place. The cast also includes Karen Hines, Tom McCamus, Arsinée Khanjian, Larissa Laskin, Kim Huffman and Rebecca Jenkins.

Episodes include &quot;Evil&quot;, in which Findlay goes to Kosovo to make a documentary on the Kosovo War but strives to sensationalize it for ratings, and &quot;Celebrity&quot;, in which a group of public relations consultants are tasked with publicizing the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

The series received a Gemini Award nomination for Best Dramatic Series at the 17th Gemini Awards in 2002.

Finkleman&#x27;s next project for the CBC was the television movie &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot;.

<text>Road is the first play written by Jim Cartwright, and was first produced in 1986 at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, directed by Simon Curtis.

The play explores the lives of the people in a deprived, working class area of Lancashire during the government of Margaret Thatcher, a time of high unemployment in the north of England. Despite its explicit nature, it was considered extremely effective in portraying the desperation of people&#x27;s lives at this time, as well as containing a great deal of humour. Set on a road on a busy night, the audience delve into the houses on the street and the characters&#x27; lives.

The play is often performed on a promenade, allowing the audience to follow the narrator (Scullery) along the road and visit different sets and the different homes of the characters.

The play has won a number of awards and was voted the 36th best play of the 20th century in a poll by the Royal National Theatre.

<text>Captain Bernard Armitage Warburton Warburton-Lee, VC (13 September 1895 – 10 April 1940) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy and a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Naval career==
Warburton-Lee attended the British Army&#x27;s Staff College, Camberley, from 1931 to 1932, where Brian Horrocks, later a lieutenant general and a corps commander, was among his fellow students. Horrocks wrote that it &quot;was the practice for a naval officer to join the course for the final year, and our sailor turned out to be that remarkable all-rounder Warburton-Lee who won the V.C. at Narvik&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
In 1936, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and because there was fear of social unrest in the naval station, the Foreign Office in London organized a ship to repatriate the remaining British citizens and on 22 July 1936 , captained by Warburton-Lee, departed from Ferrol in northwestern Spain for Britain.

===Second World War===
Warburton-Lee was 44 years old and a captain when the following action took place during the Second World War, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 10 April 1940 in Ofotfjord in Narvik, Norway, in the First Battle of Narvik, Captain Warburton-Lee of commanded the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of five destroyers (HMS &quot;Hardy&quot;, &quot;Havock&quot;, &quot;Hostile&quot;, &quot;Hotspur&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;), in a surprise attack on German destroyers and merchant ships in a blinding snowstorm. This attack was successful, but was almost immediately followed by an engagement with five more German destroyers, during which Captain Warburton-Lee was mortally wounded by a shell which hit &quot;Hardy&quot;″s bridge. For his exploits in this engagement he was posthumously awarded Britain&#x27;s highest decoration for valour in combat, the Victoria Cross. During the Second World War, only 23 Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the Royal Navy and Royal Naval Reserve, of whom only approximately 11 survived. In 1942 he was also, posthumously, awarded the Norwegian War Cross.

====VC citation====
Bernard Warburton-Lee&#x27;s VC citation reads as follows:

This was the first VC to be gazetted in the Second World War.

==Personal life==
Warburton-Lee married Elizabeth Campbell Swinton, the daughter of Captain George Swinton of Kimmerghame (see Clan Swinton), on 9 October 1924.

<doc id="1186787" wikidata="Q956760" url="?curid=1186787" title="Nahverteidigungswaffe">
<text>The Nahverteidigungswaffe was a roof mounted, breech-loaded, single shot, multi-purpose, 360° rotating grenade launcher that could fire a variety of ammunition. It was typically found on German tanks such as the Panzer IV, Panther I, Tiger I, and Tiger II from 1944 until the end of the war and was intended to replace three previous devices: the &quot;Nebelwurfgerät&quot;, the &quot;Minenabwurfvorrichtung&quot;, and pistol ports. 

==Operation==
The &quot;Nahverteidigungswaffe&quot; was a simple breech-loaded launcher tube oriented at a 50° angle and fitted in a traversable mounting on the turret roof. Unlike the previous externally mounted launchers, it was not exposed to enemy fire, being reloaded from within the vehicle through a hinged breech. 

The &quot;Nahverteidigungswaffe&quot; was designed to mate with the standard &quot;Kampfpistole&quot; flare gun and could be sealed by an armored plug when not in use. Aiming was by periscopes located on the turret and cupola. 

== Ammunition ==

The device could fire the following ammunition:

* &quot;Schnellnebelkerze&quot; 39 smoke grenade for the purpose of concealment
* &quot;Rauchsichtzeichen&quot; Orange 350 smoke signal for identification to friendly aircraft
* &quot;Leuchtgeschoss&quot; R flare 
* &quot;Sprenggranatpatrone&quot; 326 Lp anti-personnel explosive to defend the vehicle against infantry attack 

The &quot;Sprenggranatpatrone&quot; 326 Lp had a range of with a blast point of above the ground. It splintered to a circumferential distance of after an initial delay time of one second. All turret hatches and openings were to be closed when this round was fired.

== Deployment ==
The &quot;Nahverteidigungswaffe&quot; was first mounted in March 1944 on the Panther tank. It was equipped on a variety of late-war vehicles, including the Sturmtiger and the Maus tank.

<text>Charles Burley Ward, VC (10 July 1877 – 30 December 1921) was a British Army soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==

Ward was 22 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC):
==Further information==

Ward was the last recipient of the VC to be decorated by Queen Victoria and later achieved the rank of company sergeant major.

Born in Leeds, Yorkshire, he died at Bridgend, Glamorgan and is buried in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Whitchurch, Cardiff.

A (silent) movie interview with Ward following his award of the VC was filmed by the Lancashire cinematographers Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon; sealed in steel barrels after their company went out of business in the 1920s, the 800 films of their archive were discovered during demolition work in 1994, and have now been restored by the British Film Institute.

<text>A mobile station (MS) comprises all user equipment and software needed for communication with a mobile network.

The term refers to the global system connected to the mobile network, i.e. a mobile phone or mobile computer connected using a mobile broadband adapter. This is the terminology of 2G systems like GSM. In 3G systems, a mobile station (MS) is now referred to as user equipment (UE).

In GSM, a mobile station consists of four main components:

*Mobile termination (MT) - offers common functions such as: radio transmission and handover, speech encoding and decoding, error detection and correction, signalling and access to the SIM. The IMEI code is attached to the MT. It is equivalent to the network termination of an ISDN access.
*Terminal equipment (TE) - is any device connected to the MS offering services to the user. It does not contain any functions specific to GSM.
*Terminal adapter (TA) - provides access to the MT as if it were an ISDN network termination with extended capabilities. Communication between the TE and MT over the TA takes place using AT commands.
*Subscriber identity module (SIM) - is a removable subscriber identification token storing the IMSI, a unique key shared with the mobile network operator and other data.

In a mobile phone, the MT, TA and TE are enclosed in the same case. However, the MT and TE functions are often performed by distinct processors. The application processor serves as a TE, while the baseband processor serves as a MT, communication between both takes place over a bus using AT commands, which serves as a TA.

<text>The fundiform ligament of the penis is a structure of the external genitalia whose descriptions differ according to the source consulted.

The 41st Edition of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2015) and &quot;Traité d&#x27;Anatomie humaine&quot; do not acknowledge this structure. Some sources equate the fundiform ligament with the Scarpa fascia.

According to the &quot;Medical Dictionary of the French Academy of Medicine&quot; the fundiform ligament is a bilaterally paired bundle of fibres of the lateral lamina of the suspensory ligament of penis which curve around the lateral and inferior aspects of the penis to unite with the contralateral fundiform ligament beneath the urethral aspect of the penis; the two fundiform ligaments thus form a sling which offers structural support to the penis.

Although rarely mentioned, this ligament is also found in females (at the clitoris).

== Research ==
A 2023 cadaveric study on 7 cadavers characterised the fundiform ligament as a structurally heterogenous structure that is superficial to the suspensory ligament of penis. The study identified three morphological types/variants of the fundiform ligament: a single triangular structure (attached proximally onto the linea alba); a doubled structure with accessory bundles (one medial main band and one lateral accessory band on each side); and an amourphous, ligamentous fibrous connective band structure.

<doc id="1186804" wikidata="Q18351510" url="?curid=1186804" title="Initial condition">
<text>In mathematics and particularly in dynamic systems, an initial condition, in some contexts called a seed value, is a value of an evolving variable at some point in time designated as the initial time (typically denoted &quot;t&quot; = 0). For a system of order &quot;k&quot; (the number of time lags in discrete time, or the order of the largest derivative in continuous time) and dimension &quot;n&quot; (that is, with &quot;n&quot; different evolving variables, which together can be denoted by an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional coordinate vector), generally &quot;nk&quot; initial conditions are needed in order to trace the system&#x27;s variables forward through time. 

In both differential equations in continuous time and difference equations in discrete time, initial conditions affect the value of the dynamic variables (state variables) at any future time. In continuous time, the problem of finding a closed form solution for the state variables as a function of time and of the initial conditions is called the initial value problem. A corresponding problem exists for discrete time situations. While a closed form solution is not always possible to obtain, future values of a discrete time system can be found by iterating forward one time period per iteration, though rounding error may make this impractical over long horizons.

==Linear system==

===Discrete time===

A linear matrix difference equation of the homogeneous (having no constant term) form formula_1 has closed form solution formula_2 predicated on the vector formula_3 of initial conditions on the individual variables that are stacked into the vector; formula_3 is called the vector of initial conditions or simply the initial condition, and contains &quot;nk&quot; pieces of information, &quot;n&quot; being the dimension of the vector &quot;X&quot; and &quot;k&quot; = 1 being the number of time lags in the system. The initial conditions in this linear system do not affect the qualitative nature of the future behavior of the state variable &quot;X&quot;; that behavior is stable or unstable based on the eigenvalues of the matrix &quot;A&quot; but not based on the initial conditions.

Alternatively, a dynamic process in a single variable &quot;x&quot; having multiple time lags is 

:formula_5

Here the dimension is &quot;n&quot; = 1 and the order is &quot;k&quot;, so the necessary number of initial conditions to trace the system through time, either iteratively or via closed form solution, is &quot;nk&quot; = &quot;k&quot;. Again the initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the variable&#x27;s long-term evolution. The solution of this equation is found by using its characteristic equation formula_6 to obtain the latter&#x27;s &quot;k&quot; solutions, which are the characteristic values formula_7 for use in the solution equation

:formula_8

Here the constants formula_9 are found by solving a system of &quot;k&quot; different equations based on this equation, each using one of &quot;k&quot; different values of &quot;t&quot; for which the specific initial condition formula_10 Is known.

===Continuous time===

A differential equation system of the first order with &quot;n&quot; variables stacked in a vector &quot;X&quot; is

:formula_11

Its behavior through time can be traced with a closed form solution conditional on an initial condition vector formula_3. The number of required initial pieces of information is the dimension &quot;n&quot; of the system times the order &quot;k&quot; = 1 of the system, or &quot;n&quot;. The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative behavior (stable or unstable) of the system.

A single &quot;k&quot;th order linear equation in a single variable &quot;x&quot; is

:formula_13

Here the number of initial conditions necessary for obtaining a closed form solution is the dimension &quot;n&quot; = 1 times the order &quot;k&quot;, or simply &quot;k&quot;. In this case the &quot;k&quot; initial pieces of information will typically not be different values of the variable &quot;x&quot; at different points in time, but rather the values of &quot;x&quot; and its first &quot;k&quot; – 1 derivatives, all at some point in time such as time zero. The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the system&#x27;s behavior. The characteristic equation of this dynamic equation is formula_14 whose solutions are the characteristic values formula_15 these are used in the solution equation

:formula_16

This equation and its first &quot;k&quot; – 1 derivatives form a system of &quot;k&quot; equations that can be solved for the &quot;k&quot; parameters formula_17 given the known initial conditions on &quot;x&quot; and its &quot;k&quot; – 1 derivatives&#x27; values at some time &quot;t&quot;.

==Nonlinear systems==

Nonlinear systems can exhibit a substantially richer variety of behavior than linear systems can. In particular, the initial conditions can affect whether the system diverges to infinity or whether it converges to one or another attractor of the system. Each attractor, a (possibly disconnected) region of values that some dynamic paths approach but never leave, has a (possibly disconnected) basin of attraction such that state variables with initial conditions in that basin (and nowhere else) will evolve toward that attractor. Even nearby initial conditions could be in basins of attraction of different attractors (see for example Newton&#x27;s method#Basins of attraction).

Moreover, in those nonlinear systems showing chaotic behavior, the evolution of the variables exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions: the iterated values of any two very nearby points on the same strange attractor, while each remaining on the attractor, will diverge from each other over time. Thus even on a single attractor the precise values of the initial conditions make a substantial difference for the future positions of the iterates. This feature makes accurate simulation of future values difficult, and impossible over long horizons, because stating the initial conditions with exact precision is seldom possible and because rounding error is inevitable after even only a few iterations from an exact initial condition.

<text>Corporal Sidney William Ware VC (11 November 1892 – 16 April 1916) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Corporal Sidney William Ware, VC, was born in November 1892 at Whatcombe in the Parish of Winterborne Whitechurch, Dorset. He was educated at the Church of England Boys&#x27; School, Whitchurch.

He enlisted into the British Army on 29 November 1911. He served with the 1st Battalion, the Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, Duke of Albany&#x27;s) and was with his battalion at Agra in India at the start of the First World War in August 1914. His battalion, which was part of the Dehra Dun Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division, immediately went to Europe with the Indian Expeditionary Force A and landed in France in October, where it was in action almost immediately. Corporal Ware was wounded in November and after ten days leave on discharge from hospital, he returned to France. His battalion remained with the same brigade, now re-titled the 19th (Dehra Dun) Brigade, still part of the 7th (Meerut) Division, with it he was sent to Mesopotamia. Here he was again wounded in January 1916, before returning to duty a few months later.

It was then that he won his Victoria Cross on 6 April 1916. During an engagement when the order was given to withdraw to the safety of a communications trench, Corporal Ware, whose cool gallantry had been very marked during the advance, was one of the few men remaining unwounded. He then picked up a wounded man and carried him some 200 yards to cover and then returned for many others, moving to and fro under very heavy fire for more than two hours, until he had brought in all of the wounded and was completely exhausted.

However, although he was not injured on this occasion, he was not to be presented with his Victoria Cross as, a few days later, on 10 April, he was seriously wounded and brought back to the Persian Gulf. He died at the Rawalpindi Hospital on 16 April and was buried in the Amara War Cemetery in Iraq.

Always a very steady and trustworthy man, he was very fond of football and reading and was one of eight brothers of a family of 13, four of whom served in the First World War (Harold being the 4th) and one in the second (Douglas). Two were also killed in action, Sergeant Albert C. Ware, of the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment, killed on 1 July 1916, and Private Archibald Ware, Wiltshire Regiment, who lost his life on 11 March 1915.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Highlanders Museum (The Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders Collection), Fort George, Inverness-shire, Scotland.

<doc id="1186814" wikidata="Q2344573" url="?curid=1186814" title="Butch Lee">
<text>Alfred &quot;Butch&quot; Lee Jr. (born December 5, 1956) is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player. Lee was the first Puerto Rican and first Latin American-born athlete to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA), accomplishing this after being selected in the first round of the 1978 NBA draft.

He began his career in the NCAA, where he gathered several &quot;Player of the Year&quot; recognitions and earned All-American honors as both a junior and senior while at Marquette University. Lee was selected as the Most Outstanding Player at the 1977 Final Four where he led the Warriors to the school&#x27;s first national championship. The university recognized this by retiring his jersey.

In the NBA, he played for the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. Lee concluded his career in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). He is known to be the only Puerto Rican professional basketball player to win championships in the NCAA, NBA, and BSN. Lee was also a member of the Puerto Rican national team.

==Playing career==

===Early life and college===
Lee was born in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico to Gloria and Alfred Lee Sr. Lee&#x27;s family moved to Harlem, New York, U.S., when he was a young child. There he went on to become a 1st Team, PSAL All City basketball player and honor student at the DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.
Lee showed talent for basketball since an early age, and he impressed many college scouts with his game style. He accepted an offer to play for Marquette University, starring there from 1974 to 1978. In 1974 Lee asked his coach Al McGuire to allow him to play for the United States Olympic basketball team. However, his coach had sent someone else and Lee went to Puerto Rico where he qualified for the Puerto Rican national basketball team. When Puerto Rico played against the U.S. in the 1976 Summer Olympics, Lee made 15 out of 18 field goals and scored 35 points. The U.S. still avoided an upset, defeating Puerto Rico by one point, 95–94.

In 1977, Lee led Marquette to the Final Four in what McGuire had announced would be his final season. The Warriors defeated UNC-Charlotte 51–49 in the semifinal round when Lee found Jerome Whitehead with a length of the court pass for a score just before the buzzer. In the final against North Carolina, Lee scored 19 points and led the Warriors to a come-from-behind 67–59 victory to secure the national championship. Lee was named the tournament&#x27;s most outstanding player.

===Lee in the NBA===

Lee then went on to become the first Puerto Rican player to play in the National Basketball Association, when he was chosen in the first round of the 1978 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks.

During Lee&#x27;s first season in the NBA (1978-79), he started with the Hawks averaging 7.7 points per game during 49 games. He was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he enjoyed what were perhaps his best games in the league, scoring 11.5 points per game in the remaining 33 games of the season. He ended up scoring an average of 9.6 points per game in his first season in the NBA. Lee led the league in games played with 82.

After three games with the Cavs in the 1979-1980 season, Lee suffered a knee injury that would require surgery, and proved to be too big of an obstacle for him to overcome as far as his basketball career was concerned. He only scored 1.3 points per game on those three games. Before the season was over, he would be traded once again, to the Los Angeles Lakers, where, he played alongside Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, among others, for eleven games, before his injury recurred, forcing him to retire. He did, however, win an NBA championship ring, as the Lakers went on to beat the Philadelphia 76ers in that season&#x27;s NBA Finals.

====Career stats====
Lee&#x27;s NBA stats in 96 games are 779 points with an 8.1 PPG average, 307 assists with a 3.2 APG average, 137 rebounds with a 1.4 RPG average, 87 steals with a 0.9 SPG average, a .450 field goal percentage, and a .761 free-throw percentage.

==Coaching career==
Lee, who is fluent in Spanish, returned to Puerto Rico after his experience as an NBA basketball player was over. There, he became a well known and respected head coach with multiple BSN teams.

In 1992, Lee led the Capitanes de Arecibo to the BSN Finals, where they lost to the Leones de Ponce in 6 games. He also coached Aguadilla, Ponce and the Gigantes de Carolina.

In January 2009, he was announced as the new coach of the Cangrejeros de Santurce. However, he was dismissed during the playoffs after Santurce lost two games in a row.

He continued to help out with teams and coached some of them at the Guaynabo Basketball Academy (GBA).

<text>William Herbert Waring VC MM (13 October 1885 – 8 October 1918) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born and lived in Welshpool, Montgomeryshire.

He was 32 years old, and before World War I had been a member of the part-time Montgomeryshire Yeomanry. In 1918 he was serving as a lance-sergeant in the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

== Details ==
On 18 September 1918 at Ronssoy, France, Lance-Sergeant Waring led an attack against enemy machine-guns and in the face of devastating fire, single-handed rushed a strong-point, bayoneting four of the garrison and capturing twenty, with their guns. The lance-sergeant then reorganized his men, leading and inspiring them for another 400 yards when he fell mortally wounded.

Waring died 20 days later and is buried at Ste Marie Communal Cemetery, Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France.

A stone to commemorate his life was installed in the wall of the Welshpool Town Hall and unveiled in January 2015.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.

<text>Blair Anderson Wark, (27 July 1894 – 13 June 1941) was an Australian soldier, quantity surveyor, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and other Commonwealth armed forces. A member of the Citizen Military Forces from 1912, Wark enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 5 August 1915 for service in the First World War. After initially being employed in the defence of the Suez Canal, his battalion was shipped to the Western Front; it was here that Wark was twice decorated for his bravery and leadership. Having received the Distinguished Service Order in 1917 for his actions at the Battle of Polygon Wood, Wark was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 for his leadership and gallantry when in temporary command of his battalion over a three-day period, while conducting operations against the Hindenburg Line.

Returning to Australia after the war, Wark resumed work as a quantity surveyor and established his own business. He became a respected member of Australian society, holding positions and directorships in several companies and charities until 1940, when he re-enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces for service in the Second World War. Wark was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 1st Battalion (City of Sydney&#x27;s Own Regiment), but died suddenly at Puckapunyal Camp, Victoria, of coronary heart disease, aged 46.

==Early life==
Wark was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, on 27 July 1894, the fourth child of Alexander Wark, a gas engineer from Scotland, and his native-born wife Blanche Adelaide Maria (née Forde). He was educated at Fairleigh Grammar School, Bathurst, and St. Leonard&#x27;s Superior Public School before attending Sydney Technical College, where he studied quantity surveying.

For twelve months prior to July 1912, Wark was a senior cadet in the Australian Army Cadets, rising to the rank of sergeant within his unit. Concurrently he worked as a quantity surveyor before enlisting in the 18th North Sydney Infantry, Citizen Military Forces. Promoted to corporal in early 1913, he received a commission as a second lieutenant on 16 August, and for the next year was assigned to full-time defence duties in the port of Sydney.

==First World War==
===Enlistment, August 1915, to Western Front, September 1918===
On 5 August 1915, Wark enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and was posted as a lieutenant to C Company of the newly raised 30th Battalion. He proceeded to the Sydney suburb of Liverpool, where he attended an infantry school before training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. On 9 November, the 30th Battalion embarked for Egypt aboard the troopship HMAT A72 &quot;Beltana&quot;. Upon arrival in December, the battalion was tasked with the defence of the Suez Canal where, on 20 February 1916, Wark was promoted to captain.
In June 1916, the battalion departed from Alexandria to join the British Expeditionary Force in France for service on the Western Front; they arrived at Marseilles on 23 June. The 30th Battalion&#x27;s first major action began with the outbreak of the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916. The unit was originally designated with providing carrying parties for supplies and ammunition during the battle, but was subsequently pulled into the fighting. Wark commanded a company during the action, until being evacuated to the 7th Stationary Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. He was transferred to the 3rd London General Hospital in England three days later, and moved again to the 5th Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Digswell House, Welwyn, on 7 August. Recovered by September, Wark was discharged and granted leave before returning to France and the 30th Battalion later that month.

On 9 October 1916, Wark was attached to the 32nd Battalion, a position that became permanent on 18 November. The 32nd Battalion saw no major offensive action for the remainder of the year, and on 2 January 1917, Wark gained admission to the Army Infantry School. By February he was back with the 32nd Battalion, and took part in actions at Sunray Trench during March. For these, and further actions at Fromelles, Wark was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order, but the award was never made. He was promoted to major on 27 April, and in June was granted six days of leave to Paris.

In late September and early October, Wark commanded a company in the Ypres sector of Belgium during the Battle of Polygon Wood. On 29 September—the first day of the battle—Wark&#x27;s men successfully repelled the leading waves of a German counter-attack and, with artillery support, drove off the remainder. Over the following three days, his constant patrolling and personal reconnaissance of the German positions enabled him to ascertain when they were massing for further counter-attacks; on one occasion he dispersed the assembling German troops with rifle fire and grenades. For his actions during the battle, Wark was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the details of which were published in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 3 June 1918.

Granted sixteen days leave to the United Kingdom from 3 November, Wark was selected for a senior officers&#x27; course at Aldershot, England, in January 1918. On graduation he rejoined the 32nd Battalion in March as its second-in-command, and was mentioned in the despatches of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on 7 April. Throughout June and July, Wark temporarily commanded the 32nd Battalion, which had played little part in the German spring offensive. The battalion took part in the Battle of Amiens on 8 August, and continued to harry retreating German forces for the rest of the month and into early September.

===Victoria Cross, September 1918, to repatriation, September 1919===
From 29 September to 1 October 1918, Wark assumed temporary command of the 32nd Battalion, leading the unit in the 5th Division&#x27;s attack against the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt (part of the Battle of St Quentin Canal), and the subsequent advance through Nauroy, Etricourt, Magny La Fosse and Joncourt. This series of battles became the 32nd Battalion&#x27;s final actions for the war, and it was during this period that Wark earned his Victoria Cross.
The 32nd Battalion was to commence its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village. Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance was held up by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them. On reaching the southern end of St Quentin Canal tunnel, Wark came across two hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as prisoners of war.

Shortly afterwards, Wark observed a battery of German 77 mm guns firing on his rear companies, causing heavy casualties. Collecting a party of his men, he rushed the battery and succeeded in capturing four guns in conjunction with ten crewmen. With only two men, he pushed forward and surprised fifty Germans near Magny-la-Fosse who subsequently surrendered. At 15:00, he halted his battalion near Joncourt, and sent out patrols which found the town still occupied by enemy forces. The 32nd Battalion responded by withdrawing slightly and strengthening its line. At 17:30, the Germans launched a counter-attack that was repulsed with the assistance of the 31st Battalion, together with some men from the 46th (North Midland) Division.

At 07:00 the next day, the 32nd Battalion attacked once more, advancing to a point just north of Etricourt. Under heavy shelling and machine gun fire, they established a line between Joncourt and Etricourt. On 1 October, at 06:00, with a company attached from the 30th Battalion, the 32nd Battalion launched an attack that cut through Joncourt. Leading from the front, Wark dashed forward and silenced machine guns that were causing heavy casualties; this enabled the 5th Division to complete its task of forcing through to the Beaurevoir Line.

The full citation for Wark&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 December 1918, reading:

The 32nd Battalion was resting and retraining away from the frontline when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918. On 5 January 1919, Wark was granted leave to the United Kingdom, where he accepted his Victoria Cross from King George V on 13 February. Returning to his unit six days later, Wark was then assigned to the 30th Battalion, and sent back to England in preparation for demobilisation. On 31 May 1919, Wark married writer Phyllis Marquiss Munro at St George&#x27;s Parish Church, Worthing, Sussex; ten days later, he boarded HT &quot;Port Lyttleton&quot; to return to Australia, where he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 28 September 1919. Two of Wark&#x27;s brothers also served in the First World War, both in the 56th Battalion; Alexander was a sergeant, and Keith, a recipient of the Distinguished Conduct Medal, rose to the rank of lieutenant.

==Later life==
On demobilisation Wark resumed business as a quantity surveyor in Sydney, later becoming a principal of &quot;Thompson &amp; Wark, quantity surveyors&quot;. In June 1920, he was in charge of ten fellow Victoria Cross recipients introduced to the Prince of Wales at Government House, during the latter&#x27;s visit to Australia. Wark became a respected member of Australian society, holding several honorary public positions, including director of the Royal North Shore Hospital, life governor of the New South Wales Benevolent Society, and a councillor of the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association of New South Wales. He was a committee member of the Hawkesbury River Race Club, as well as holding directorships in insurance and petroleum companies.

In 1922, Wark and Phyllis divorced; five years later, on 10 December 1927, he married Catherine Mary Davis at St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Sydney. The couple had one son and two daughters. On 17 April 1940, Wark returned to active duty in the Second World War, and was appointed to the 1st Battalion (City of Sydney&#x27;s Own Regiment) as a major. On 26 July, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the battalion. While bivouacked at Puckapunyal Camp, Victoria, he died suddenly of coronary heart disease on 13 June 1941. The medical officer attending later concluded: &quot;The cause of death in my opinion was angina pectoris, the fatal attack having been brought on by physical exertion during a night exercise under very cold conditions.&quot; Wark was cremated on 16 June at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney, after a full military funeral. His Victoria Cross is part of the collections of the Queensland Museum, South Bank, but was loaned to the Australian War Memorial from February 2017 for temporary display in the latter&#x27;s Hall of Valour during the centenary period of the First World War.

<doc id="1186819" wikidata="Q5051976" url="?curid=1186819" title="Catfish Creek (Lake Erie, Elgin)">
<text>Catfish Creek is a creek in Elgin County in southwestern Ontario which empties into the north shore of Lake Erie.
Catfish Creek begins in the northwest area of Aylmer and flows in a generally southern direction before flowing into Lake Erie at Port Bruce. It is a significant creek in that it flows through an area of Carolinian forest. Worthy of note is the area just northwest of Port Bruce called the Catfish Creek Slope and Floodplain Forest. &quot;Encompassing 233 hectares, this unique Area of Natural and Scientific Interest contains some of the most endangered habitat in Canada. It lies in the heart of the Carolinian Zone of Southern Ontario and provides mature, deciduous forest cover that is able to support plant and animal life normally found much further south. All of this Carolinian Canada site is privately owned.&quot;

==History==

The arrondissement of Lyon was created in 1800. On 1 January 2015, 101 communes that did not join the newly created Metropolis of Lyon passed from the arrondissement of Lyon to the arrondissement of Villefranche-sur-Saône. On 1 February 2017, 78 communes passed from the arrondissement of Villefranche-sur-Saône to the arrondissement of Lyon.

As a result of the reorganisation of the cantons of France which came into effect in 2015, the borders of the cantons are no longer related to the borders of the arrondissements. The cantons of the arrondissement of Lyon were, as of January 2015:

<text>The King Country (Māori: Te Rohe Pōtae or Rohe Pōtae o Maniapoto) is a region of the western North Island of New Zealand. It extends approximately from Kawhia Harbour and the town of Ōtorohanga in the north to the upper reaches of the Whanganui River in the south, and from the Hauhungaroa and Rangitoto Ranges in the east to near the Tasman Sea in the west. It comprises hill country, large parts of which are forested.

The region, albeit loosely defined, is very significant in New Zealand&#x27;s history. The term &quot;King Country&quot; dates from the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, when colonial forces invaded the Waikato and forces of the Māori King Movement withdrew south of what was called the &quot;aukati&quot;, or boundary, a line of &quot;pā&quot; alongside the Puniu River near Kihikihi. Land behind the &quot;aukati&quot; remained native territory, with Europeans warned they crossed it under threat of death.

Known for its rugged, rural roads and diverse landscape, the King Country has a warm climate, considered subtropical.

== Government ==
The King Country is not an entity in local government. It forms part of two local government regions, Waikato and Manawatū-Whanganui, and all or part of four districts: Ōtorohanga, Ruapehu, Taupō and Waitomo.

Taranaki-King Country is a parliamentary electorate for central government. The member represents an area which stretches from the outskirts of New Plymouth City to the outskirts of Hamilton City and including the King Country towns of Te Awamutu, Ōtorohanga and Te Kūiti.

== Geography ==
The King Country (a.k.a. Western Uplands) is largely made up of rolling hill country, including the Rangitoto and Hauhungaroa Ranges. It includes extensive karst regions, producing such features as the Waitomo Caves.

The area is largely rural and sparsely settled, with no cities or large towns. The most significant townships are the rural service centres of Te Kūiti and Ōtorohanga (in the north) and Taumarunui (in the south).

== History ==

Prior to European settlement, the area was occupied by various Māori iwi, especially Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Tama, and Ngāti Tūwharetoa.

In July 1863, Governor Sir George Grey ordered an invasion of the Waikato with colonial forces supplemented by small numbers of British-allied Maori. The invasion was aimed at suppressing Kingite power, which was seen by the colonial government as a threat to Crown authority in New Zealand; it was also aimed to drive Waikato Maori from the region in readiness for occupation and settlement by Pakeha settlers.

Heavily outnumbered and disadvantaged by superior firepower, the Kingite forces retreated southwards from the Waikato after the battle at Ōrākau in April 1864, eventually being forced to flee to Maniapoto land, later called the King Country.

At this time, the region received a Māori name, &quot;Rohe pōtae&quot;. This name translates as &quot;Area of the Hat&quot;, and is said to have originated when the second Māori King Tāwhiao put his white top hat on a large map of the North Island and declared that all land covered by the hat would be under his &quot;mana&quot; (or authority).

Heavy casualties at the Battle of Gate Pa at Tauranga in April 1864 prompted General Duncan Cameron to abandon plans for further military campaigns in the Waikato area, and Grey and the colonial government were forced to accept this decision. The King Country, mountainous, poor and isolated, was not an attractive conquest. King Tāwhiao and his followers were able to maintain a rebel Māori monarchy in exile and a refuge for rebel Māori opposed to the government for more than a decade although living conditions were very poor. This may be partly due to the large influx of about 3,500 Waikato people who swamped the resources of the approximately 800 Maniapoto living in the rohe.

On 15 May 1872 Te Kooti, on the run from government forces, crossed the Waikato River and entered the territory as supplicant and was granted asylum. In 1880, William Moffat, apparently a land agent or buyer, was shot and killed.

In 1881, as a result of ongoing friction with his hosts over the question of land sales, and a general amnesty being granted to the rebels, Tāwhiao emerged and laid down the King Movement&#x27;s arms. After successful negotiations between the government, Wahanui, Rewi and Taonui, including a pardon for Te Kooti by 1883 the King Country was made accessible to Europeans. It was opened to road surveying, and the start of the Main Trunk Line - but with a prohibition on the sale of alcohol throughout the district. At a March 1883 meeting, John Bryce got a compact that allowed the surveying of the rail route. At a February 1885 meeting at Kihikihi with John Ballance construction of the line was approved. Ballance was criticised for not requiring cession of land alongside the route (which would rise in value because of the line), but he knew that would not be acceptable to Māori.

Construction of the railway began in 1885, and finished in 1908, with the completion greatly improving transport and communications in the King Country, promoting settlement and farming in the area - as well as assisting in the growth of rural service towns such as Taumarunui which was an important railway depot until the 1950s.

The alcohol ban continued as section 272 of the Licensing Act 1908—see the map of the &quot;Boundaries of the King Country Licensing Area&quot; in Jonathan Sarich&#x27;s 2011 report. As a young man, John A. Lee was jailed for smuggling alcohol into the area around 1910. In 1923 and again in 1926, in response to a pro-alcohol petition sent around for signatures, another deputation of leaders of the King Country -- Te Rata Mahuta Tawhiao Potarau (fourth Māori King), Tuwhakaririka Patana, Hotu Tana Pakukohatu, and Thirty Leading Chiefs of the King Country—came before the Prime Minister to petition that the prohibition against alcohol in their area be protected. In March 1949 Korokī Mahuta, the fifth Māori King (1933-1966), and Princess Te Kirihaehae Te Puea Herangi (1883-1952) led a 400-strong delegation to Parliament, representing the people of the Waikato, Ngāti Maniapoto, Taranaki, Ngāti Tūwharetoa and Te Wainui a Rua, concerning the &quot;King Country Pact&quot; to protect the prohibition line. However, their plea was ignored, and in 1951 1000 Māori rallied at Tauranganui Pa, Tuakau to protest the laxity in allowing alcohol in their area. In 1951 the National Party was re-elected, and one of its campaign promises was for a single referendum on no-license in the King Country. In 1953 a Bill was introduced for a joint poll requiring a 60% majority in November 1954, and the result was predictable given the demographics of the population then living in the area: licensing was carried by a large majority: 80% for European and 25% of Maori in favour of a license.

== Economy ==

The greater part of the region&#x27;s economy is involved in farming (especially pastoral farming) and forestry, with some supporting services. There are some areas of tourist significance, such as Waitomo Caves. The King Country also contains areas of conservation estate, especially Pureora Forest Park.

From 1966 to 31 March 2010, King Country Radio (with the call sign 1ZU) operated from Taumarunui.

== Sport ==
The King Country Rugby Football Union has produced several rugby union players who became All Blacks: Kevin Boroevich, Ronald Bryers, Colin Meads, Stan Meads, Jack McLean, Bill Phillips, Joe Ratima and Graham Whiting.

The North King Country soccer team plays in a yellow and blue strip. It is based in Ōtorohanga.

<text>&quot;You Had Time&quot; is a song written and recorded by American songwriter Ani DiFranco from her 1994 album &quot;Out of Range&quot;. The song, one of her more critically lauded from the album, describes the complicated emotions associated with the breakup of a long-term relationship. DiFranco describes this song as one in which she felt freedom in recording and was &quot;becoming herself&quot; and learning how to &quot;document [her] songs&quot; in the studio.

The album recording begins with an acoustic piano solo of more than two minutes. Writer and occasional music journalist Nick Hornby featured the song in his work &quot;31 Songs&quot; (also known as &quot;Songbook&quot;), in which he discussed his thoughts on a number of his favourite songs. He attributes the two-minute solo to a depiction of the creative process behind the song. Hornby also suggests that &quot;You Had Time&quot; is an example of a song that, while it may not read as poetry on paper, nevertheless makes for a beautiful song.

The song was used in the 2001 Canadian film &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot;, as the backdrop to a montage of one of the protagonists&#x27; reactions to grief at the breakup of a serious relationship.

Swedish musician Lars Winnerbäck has recorded a version of the song. Translated into Swedish, the song is called &quot;Du hade tid&quot; and can be found on Winnerbäck&#x27;s album &quot;Singel&quot; (2001).

<text>The Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives (LHCMA) at King&#x27;s College London was set up in 1964. The Centre holds the private papers of over 700 senior British defence personnel who held office since 1900. Individual collections range in size from a single file to the 1000 boxes of Captain Sir Basil Liddell Hart&#x27;s papers. To these are now being added research materials, notably interview transcripts, collected in connection with television documentaries and academic projects.

The scope of the holdings is vast, from high level defence policy and strategic planning as, for example, in the papers of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke and General Hastings Lionel Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay down to the command of individual units in the field. The Second Boer War is strongly represented and subsequently almost every major campaign in which British troops have fought, including the Korean and Falklands Wars and the Gulf Crisis; the latter two are covered by contemporary interview transcripts.

Many significant collections reflect the revolution in weapon technology in the 20th century and the re-evaluation of tactics and strategy which necessarily followed on from the invention of the tank and the development of air power. There is also much on the debate over nuclear issues.

The Centre&#x27;s web site hosts the Location Register of Twentieth Century Defence Personnel, a database of some 3000 British defence personnel who achieved the ranks above and including Major General, Air Vice Marshal and Rear Admiral between the years 1900-1975.

The archives are open to readers able to demonstrate the seriousness of their interest in the papers. Military studies have been taught at King&#x27;s College since 1927 and in 1953 a department of War Studies, the only university department of its kind in Great Britain, was established.
