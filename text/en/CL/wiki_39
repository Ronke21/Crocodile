<text>The National Park of Upper Niger is a national park in Guinea that was gazetted in January 1997 with a core area of . The park protects important tracts of forest and savannah, and is considered a conservation priority for West Africa as a whole.

==History==
Areas of low human impact are comparatively rare now in Guinea, and found only in areas of low population density. One such area is that of the Mafou Forest, the last remaining area of dry forest in Guinea and one of the few left in West Africa. This area has a low population because of widespread river-blindness and the atrocities of Samory Touré in the latter part of the 19th century. The area has been little disturbed in the last 50 years.
The park comprises two zones, a core protected zone and a buffer zone in which local people are encouraged to use the resources of the park in a sustainable way. Farming and the collection of non-timber forest products is permitted. The government manages fishing, hunting, and timber harvesting in cooperation with local communities. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.

==Ecology of the park==
The park covers several ecological zones, the dominant is that of savannah, consisting of woodland and bushland. A smaller area of the park consists of riparian forests along the Niger and Mafou Rivers. Around five percent of the park is agricultural, along the edges of the park. The park is subject to frequent fires during the dry season.

==Fauna of the park==
Surveys in the park conducted during 1996–97 revealed a diverse mammalian fauna of 94 species including:
*24 rodents
*18 bats: Franquet&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomops franqueti&quot;), horseshoe bat (&quot;Rhinolophus alcyone&quot;)
*17 carnivores: Caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;), Egyptian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;), Gambian mongoose (&quot;Mungos gambianus&quot;), spot-necked otter (&quot;Lutra maculicollis&quot;)
*14 ungulates: giant forest hog (&quot;Hylochoerus meinertzhageni&quot;), kob (&quot;Kobus kob&quot;), waterbuck (&quot;K. ellipsiprymnus&quot;)
*nine insectivores: four-toed hedgehog (&quot;Atelerix albiventris&quot;), climbing shrew (&quot;Suncus megalura&quot;)
*seven primates: chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;), Senegal galago (&quot;Galago senegalensis&quot;)
*giant pangolin (&quot;Manis gigantea&quot;) and tree pangolin (&quot;M. tricuspis&quot;), and
*African savanna hare (&quot;Lepus victoriae&quot;).
The African elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) once occurred in the park but is now extinct.

African manatee (&quot;Trichechus senegalensis&quot;) has been recorded. In 1997, lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) returned to the protected area, probably migrating from the Tinkisso River region.

==Threats to the park==
There is a large trade in hunted animals from the park. At present this is carefully managed by park authorities, who feel that creating incentives for careful management of the resources is the best way to protect the forest as a whole. This is in line with current trends in community conservation.

<text>Kenneth George Boothe OD (born 22 March 1948) is a Jamaican vocalist known for his distinctive vibrato and timbre. Boothe achieved an international reputation as one of Jamaica&#x27;s finest vocalists through a series of crossover hits that appealed to both reggae fans and mainstream audiences.

==Biography==
Ken Boothe was born in Denham Town, Kingston. He attended Denham Primary Elementary School and during this period developed an interest in music after receiving encouragement from his eldest sister, Hyacinth Clover, who was an established vocalist. Boothe cites singer Owen Gray as a major influence, particularly after hearing Gray perform the Leiber and Stoller rhythm and blues version of the 1920s blues standard, &quot;Kansas City Blues&quot;, written by E L Bowman and notably performed by Jim Jackson in 1927. Stranger Cole, who was an established artist and neighbor to Boothe, had already worked with Boothe on the Sir Percy sound system as well as recording two songs for independent producer Sir Mike though Boothe&#x27;s major breakthrough came in 1963 after Cole arranged an audition at Duke Reid&#x27;s studio. The audition with Cole and Boothe performing the song &quot;Uno Dos Tres&quot; was a success and Boothe and Cole formed the duo &#x27;Stranger &amp; Ken&#x27; with the first track released by them being &quot;Hush Baby&quot; on the B-side of Cole&#x27;s Island Records single &quot;Last Love&quot;. This was followed by the singles &quot;Thick in Love&quot; both released in 1963 on R&amp;B Records. They released several more popular singles between 1963 and 1965, including &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot;, and &quot;Artibella&quot;. Boothe also recorded as a duo with Roy Shirley (as Roy &amp; Ken), which resulted in the release of the single &quot;Paradise&quot; in 1966.

Boothe&#x27;s first solo tracks were recorded in 1966 after Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd had signed him to his Studio One Label. He also recorded material for Phil Pratt and Sonia Pottinger the same year. He had almost immediate success with songs including &quot;The Train Is Coming&quot; (on which he was backed by the Wailers), the first, ska version, of later reggae song You&#x27;re No Good with Soulettes (the group Bob Marley&#x27;s future wife Rita Anderson was in) on B-side, and &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;. The following year, Boothe and Alton Ellis had a successful UK tour with the Studio One session group, the Soul Vendors. Boothe was promoted as &quot;Mr. Rock Steady&quot; by Dodd during this period. The rocksteady classic &quot;Moving Away&quot; was released in 1967 or 1968 on the Coxsone label. &quot;Moving Away&quot; is a song still popular today, and covered or sampled by many artists, among them Dennis Brown, Jackie Mittoo (&quot;Macka Fat&quot;), Jack Radics I-Roy, U-Roy (&quot;African Message&quot;), Janet Key, Jaime Hinckson, Romain des Bois, Bruno Mars, Al Campbell (&quot;Dress Black&quot; Garnett Silk (&quot;It&#x27;s Growing&quot;), Half Pint (&quot;Substitute Lover&quot;), Wayne Wonder (&quot;Time To Say Good Bye&quot;), Leroy Smart (&quot;Talk About Friends&quot;), Sanchez (&quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;), Admiral Tibet (&quot;Nuthin Nah Run&quot; among many others. Many of Boothe&#x27;s songs have been reused in one way or another. On the B-side of the single &quot;Moving Away&quot; was the instrumental &quot;Streets of Gold&quot; by the Skatalites. Boothe continued to record for Dodd until 1970, when he switched to producer Leslie Kong&#x27;s Beverley&#x27;s Records and reggae, where his success continued with hits such as &quot;Freedom Street&quot; and &quot;Why Baby Why&quot;.

After Kong died, Boothe recorded for many of Jamaica&#x27;s top producers during the early 1970s, including Keith Hudson, Herman Chin Loy, Vincent &quot;Randy&quot; Chin, and Phil Pratt. He then formed the group Conscious Minds with B. B. Seaton.

Under a new direction from record producer Lloyd Charmers, Boothe released &quot;Everything I Own&quot; on Trojan Records, which reached Number One in the UK Singles Chart in 1974. The song, written by David Gates, was given a sympathetic light reggae feel and it received airplay and an appreciative audience in the West Indies and was regularly played on the radio stations of the UK due to its &quot;crossover&quot; appeal. David Gates&#x27; own group, Bread, had had a minor UK hit with the song in the spring of 1972, but it had only reached No. 32. Boothe&#x27;s reggae version of the song &quot;Everything I Own&quot; reached Number One in the UK Singles Chart on 26 October 1974, and stayed at the top of the charts for three weeks. It featured Lloyd Parks on bass guitar, Paul Douglas a.k.a. Paul Williams on drums, Willie Lindo on guitar, and Lloyd Charmers on organ, piano and percussion. The recording was produced by Lloyd Charmers.

Boothe had one more hit in the UK Singles Chart during the 1970s, &quot;Crying Over You&quot;, which made No. 11, with Trojan Records&#x27; collapse and a split with Charmers losing much of the momentum built up by his two hits. Boothe recorded a reggae version of the standard &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; which was released in 1974 on the Studio One label.

In 1978, along with Dillinger, Leroy Smart, and Delroy Wilson, Boothe was referenced by lyricist Joe Strummer in the Clash&#x27;s song, &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot;. Boothe reunited with Charmers in the late 1970s when a revived Trojan Records released the albums &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (first issued on LTD in 1976) and &quot;Who Gets Your Love&quot;, but the reunion proved to be short-lived. He continued to record during the 1980s and had a few hits during 1986 and 1987.

In more recent times, Boothe has recorded for Bunny Lee, Phil Pratt, King Jammy, Pete Weston, Jack Ruby, Hugh &quot;Red Man&quot; James, Castro Brown and Tappa Zukie. In 1995 a version of &quot;The Train Is Coming&quot;, re-worked with Shaggy, was used in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Money Train&quot;.

A two-disc set of Boothe&#x27;s recordings for Trojan, &quot;Crying Over You&quot;, was released in 2001.

Boothe was awarded the Order of Distinction for his contribution to Jamaican music by the Jamaican government in 2003.

<text>Lake Alaotra (, ; ) is the largest lake in Madagascar, located in Alaotra-Mangoro Region and on the island&#x27;s northern central plateau. Its basin is composed of shallow freshwater lakes and marshes surrounded by areas of dense vegetation. It forms the center of the island&#x27;s most important rice-growing region. It is a rich habitat for wildlife, including some rare and endangered species, as well as an important fishing ground. Lake Alaotra and its surrounding wetlands cover , and include a range of habitats, including open water, reedbeds, marshes, and rice paddies. The lake itself covers . Lake Alaotra was declared a wetland of international importance under the international Ramsar Convention on February 2, 2003.

The longfin tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis macrochir&quot;) was introduced into Lake Alaotra from the mainland in 1954 and proliferated quickly. By 1957, it provided 46% of the catch, perhaps because it was moving into an empty ecological niche as a phytophagous species.

The fertile plain surrounding Lake Alaotra is Madagascar&#x27;s most important rice-producing region. The hills surrounding the lake were formerly forested but have mostly been cleared for farmland in past decades. Severe erosion on these vulnerable hill slopes has caused considerable sedimentation of the lake, which is fast disappearing; the lake is now only deep during the dry season. Pressure to create more rice fields has also led locals to burn the reedbeds surrounding the lake. These reedbeds provide the sole habitat of the endemic Alaotra gentle lemur (&quot;Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis&quot;). The Alaotra gentle lemur is now limited to only of remaining reedbeds, and in recent years, its population rapidly declined by 60%, from about 7,500 individuals in 1994 to 3,000 in 2001, mostly from habitat loss, but also from hunting by local villagers.

The lake is the type locality of the butterfly &quot;Artitropa alaotrana&quot; and an important but increasingly threatened habitat for waterbirds, including the endangered Meller&#x27;s duck (&quot;Anas melleri&quot;). Two waterbird species were endemic to northern Madagascar, the Madagascar pochard (&quot;Aythya innotata&quot;) and the Alaotra grebe (&quot;Tachybaptus rufolavatus&quot;). The Madagascar pochard is now critically endangered and no longer found on the lake, although very small numbers exist elsewhere. The Alaotra grebe was declared extinct in 2010. The area of the lake may have been its only habitat.

The Ambato River provides the lake with water and also drains it. After 381 km, the river flows into the Indian Ocean.

<text>Leslie Kong (20 December 1933 – 9 August 1971) was a Jamaican reggae producer. 

== Early life ==
Kong was born into a Chinese-Jamaican family. He had a &quot;relatively comfortable upbringing&quot; and attended St. George&#x27;s College in Kingston.

==Career==
Leslie and his two older brothers Cecil and Lloyd ran a restaurant, ice cream parlour and record shop called Beverley&#x27;s in Orange Street, Kingston. In 1961, he encountered a young Jimmy Cliff outside of his shop singing a song he had written called &quot;Dearest Beverley&quot;, in the hopes that the mention of the establishment would convince Kong to record him. This encounter led Kong to launch his own record label, Beverley&#x27;s, and to record Cliff&#x27;s song, launching Cliff&#x27;s career in the process.

Cliff took on an A&amp;R role for the label, and brought Bob Marley to Kong&#x27;s attention. In 1962, Kong recorded Marley&#x27;s first single: &quot;One Cup of Coffee&quot; and &quot;Judge Not&quot;, and Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Miss Jamaica&quot;. Kong, known in Jamaican music circles as &quot;the Chinaman&quot;, quickly established himself as the island&#x27;s leading producer of local popular music. Throughout the 1960s Kong kept recording many leading Jamaican artists from ska to reggae through rocksteady including Joe Higgs, Desmond Dekker, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Derrick Morgan, John Holt and Stranger Cole. A wise businessman, Kong was one of the original shareholders in Island Records along with Chris Blackwell and Australian engineer Graeme Goodall. Starting in 1963 Kong began licensing ska recordings to Blackwell for release in the UK on Island&#x27;s Black Swan imprint. After Blackwell bought out Kong and Goodall&#x27;s share in Island, in 1967 Kong formed a second partnership with Graeme Goodall, who created the Pyramid label in the UK for the successful release of Kong&#x27;s rocksteady and early reggae productions. When Pyramid folded in 1969, the licensing successes continued with Trojan Records.

Kong is known for being the first Jamaican producer to get international hits with long-time collaborator Desmond Dekker, in 1967 with &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot; and, above all, in 1969 with &quot;Israelites&quot; which topped the UK Singles Chart in April 1969 and went to number nine on the US charts in June 1969, selling over two million copies. During the early reggae period, he worked with Bob Marley and The Wailers (&quot;The Best of the Wailers&quot;) and enjoyed several successful hits with The Pioneers&#x27; &quot;Long Shot Kick The Bucket&quot;, and The Melodians&#x27; &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; and &quot;Sweet Sensation&quot;. His works with The Maytals also led to many hits including &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot; and the UK charting single &quot;Monkey Man&quot;. Matthew Sherman explains the relationship between The Maytals and Leslie Kong as, &quot;From &#x27;69 to &#x27;71, Toots (Toots Hibbert) could do no wrong recording for Leslie Kong. With the consistent nucleus of musicians, the Beverley&#x27;s All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Wright, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, Paul Douglas and Winston Grennan) and the Maytals’ brilliant harmonising, Toots wrote and sang his unmistakable voice about every subject imaginable.&quot;

Other vocalists who recorded for him and the Beverley&#x27;s label include Ken Boothe, Bruce Ruffin, The Gaylads and Delroy Wilson. Ex-Skatalites saxophonist Roland Alphonso cut numerous instrumentals for Kong during the rocksteady period. When reggae arrived in late 1968, lead instrumental duties were handled by organists Ansell Collins and Winston Wright, a member of Tommy McCook&#x27;s Supersonics.

Kong makes a cameo appearance in the Jamaican film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, playing a recording engineer in a scene in which Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s character watches a studio recording session, by Toots and the Maytals, of the song &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; (Kong was the actual producer of that recording). 

Kong&#x27;s plans to release a compilation album of tracks from the singles he produced by the Wailers led to Bunny Wailer allegedly threatening Kong with a curse, telling him that if he issued the record he would die. Kong went ahead with the release in 1970, and died of a heart attack, aged 37, in August 1971.

<doc id="1166951" wikidata="Q344080" url="?curid=1166951" title="Talbot Mundy">
<text>Talbot Mundy (born William Lancaster Gribbon, 23 April 1879 – 5 August 1940) was an English writer of adventure fiction. Based for most of his life in the United States, he also wrote under the pseudonym of Walter Galt. Best known as the author of &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; and the Jimgrim series, much of his work was published in pulp magazines.

Mundy was born to a conservative middle-class family in Hammersmith, London. Educated at Rugby College, he left with no qualifications and moved to British India, where he worked in administration and then journalism. He relocated to East Africa, where he worked as an ivory poacher and then as the town clerk of Kisumu. In 1909 he moved to New York City in the U.S., where he found himself living in poverty. A friend encouraged him to start writing about his life experiences, and he sold his first short story to Frank Munsey&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Scrap Book&quot;, in 1911. He soon began selling short stories and non-fiction articles to a variety of pulp magazines, such as &quot;Argosy&quot;, &quot;Cavalier&quot;, and &quot;Adventure&quot;. In 1914 Mundy published his first novel, &quot;Rung Ho!&quot;, soon followed by &quot;The Winds of the World&quot; and &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;, all of which were set in British India and drew upon his own experiences. Critically acclaimed, they were published in both the U.S. and U.K.

Becoming a U.S. citizen, in 1918 he joined the Christian Science new religious movement, and with them moved to Jerusalem to establish the city&#x27;s first English-language newspaper. Returning to the U.S. in 1920, he began writing the Jimgrim series and saw the first film adaptations of his stories. Spending time at the Theosophical community of Lomaland in San Diego, California, he became a friend of Katherine Tingley and embraced Theosophy. Many of his novels produced in the coming years, most notably &quot;Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Guard&quot;, reflected his Theosophical beliefs. He also involved himself in various failed business ventures, including an oil drilling operation in Tijuana, Mexico. During the Great Depression he supplemented his career writing novels and short stories by authoring scripts for the radio series &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;. In later life he suffered from diabetes, eventually dying of complications arising from the disease.

During Mundy&#x27;s career his work was often compared with that of his more commercially successful contemporaries, H. Rider Haggard and Rudyard Kipling. Like them he expressed a positive interest in Asian religion and philosophy, although unlike them he adopted an anti-colonialist stance. His work has been cited as an influence on a variety of later science-fiction and fantasy writers, and he has been the subject of two biographies.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1879–99===

Mundy was born as William Lancaster Gribbon on 23 April 1879 at his parental home of 59 Milson Road, Hammersmith in West London. The following month he was baptised into the Anglican Church at the local St. Matthews Church. His father, Walter Galt Gribbon (1845–95), had been born in Leeds, Yorkshire as the son of a porcelain and glass merchant. Gribbon had studied at Oxford University&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s College and then trained as a barrister before relocating to Swansea, where he first worked as a school teacher and then an accountant. After his first wife&#x27;s death, he married Mundy&#x27;s mother, Margaret Lancaster, in Nantyglo in July 1878. A member of an English family based in Wales, she was the sister of the politician John Lancaster. After a honeymoon in Ilfracombe, Devon, the newly married couple moved to Hammersmith, where Mundy was their first child. They would have three further children: Walter Harold (b. 1881), Agnes Margaret (b. 1882), and Florence Mary (c.1883), although the latter died in infancy. In 1883 the family moved to nearby Norbiton, although within a few years had moved out of London to Kingston Hill, Surrey.

Mundy was raised into a conservative middle-class Victorian milieu. His father owned a successful accountancy business and was director of the Woking Water and Gas Company, as well as being an active member of the Conservative Party and Primrose League. He was also a devout Anglican, serving as warden at St. Luke&#x27;s Church. The family went on summer holidays to southern coastal towns such as Hythe, Sandgate, and Charmouth, with Mundy also spending time visiting relatives in Bardney, Lincolnshire. He attended Grove House, a preparatory school in Guildford, Surrey, before receiving a scholarship to attend Rugby School, where he arrived in September 1893.

In 1895 his father died of a brain hemorrhage, and Mundy henceforth became increasingly rebellious. He left Rugby School without any qualifications in December 1895; in later years he recalled bad memories of the institution, comparing it to &quot;prisons run by sadists&quot;. With Mundy unable to go to university, his mother hoped that he might enter the Anglican clergy. He worked briefly for a newspaper in London, although the firm closed shortly after. He left England and moved to Quedlinburg in northern Germany with his pet fox terrier. He didn&#x27;t speak German but secured work as an assistant driver towing vans for a circus; after a colleague drunkenly killed his dog he left the job. Back in England, he worked in farming and estate management for his uncle in Lincolnshire, describing this lifestyle as &quot;&#x27;High Farming,&#x27; high church and old port and all that went with that life – pheasant shooting, fox-hunting and so on.&quot;

===India and East Africa: 1899–1909===

Talbot&#x27;s accounts of the following years are unreliable, tainted by his own fictionalised claims about his activities. In March 1899 he sailed aboard the &quot;Caledonia&quot; to Bombay in British India, where he had secured an administrative job in a famine relief program based in the native state of Baroda. There he purchased a horse and became a fan of pig-sticking, a form of boar hunting.
After suffering a bout of malaria he returned to Britain in April 1900. In later years he claimed that during this period he had fought for the British Army in the Second Boer War, although this was untrue, for chronologically it conflicted with his documented activities in Britain; he did however have relatives who fought in the conflict. Another of his later claims was that while visiting Brighton in summer 1900 he ran into his favourite writer, Rudyard Kipling, while walking in the street, and that they had a conversation about India.

Securing a job as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, in March 1901 he returned to India aboard the &quot;Caledonia&quot;. His assignment was to report on the Mahsud uprising against the British administration led by Mulla Pawindah. On this assignment, he accompanied British troops although only reached as far as Peshawar, not entering the Khyber Pass which he would use as a setting for later stories. While in Rajputana he had his first experience with an Indian guru, and after his assignment he went tiger hunting. In Bombay in 1901 he met Englishwoman Kathleen Steele, and they had returned to Britain by late 1902, where he gained work for the Walton and Company merchant firm in Holborn. The couple married in Westminster in January 1903. By this point he had amassed large debts, and with his wife fled to Cape Town, South Africa to evade his creditors; in his absence he was declared bankrupt. He wife returned to London, and they never saw each other again. From there, he claimed to have boarded a merchant sailing vessel to Australia, where he spent time in Sydney and Brisbane before sailing back to Africa and disembarking in Laurenço Marques, Portuguese East Africa.

In February 1904 he arrived in Mombasa, British East Africa, later claiming that he initially worked as a hunter. He also claimed that while near Shirati, he was shot in the leg with a poison spear by a Masai who was stealing his cattle. He travelled to Muanza in German East Africa, where he was afflicted with blackwater fever. Mundy then worked as an elephant hunter, collecting and selling ivory. His later novel, &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot;, was inspired largely by his own experiences at this time. In later years he alleged that he met Frederick Selous at this juncture, although Mundy&#x27;s biographer has pointed out that Selous was not in East Africa at this time.

Mundy secured employment as the town clerk of Kisumu, a frontier town where he was stationed during a number of indigenous tribal insurgencies against British imperial rule; the Kisii rebelled in the winter of 1904–05, followed by the Sotik and the Nandi in summer 1905. On each occasion the rebels were defeated by the British Army. Christian missionaries pressured Mundy into overseeing a program of providing clothes for the native population, who often went naked; he thought this unnecessary, although designed a goat-skin apron for them to wear. He made the acquaintance of a magico-religious specialist, Oketch, of the Kakamega Kavirondo tribe, who healed him after a hunting accident. He had sexual relationships with a variety of indigenous women, and was dismissed from his job as a result. He informed his wife of these activities, thus suggesting that she sue him for divorce; the divorce was granted in May 1908.

Unemployed, he moved to Nairobi, where he met a married woman, Inez Craven (née Broom). Together they eloped, and she divorced her husband in November 1908. The couple moved to an island on Lake Victoria, where they lived from February to June, although were subsequently arrested under the Distressed British Subjects Act; under this, they faced imprisoned for six months in Mombasa before deportation to Bombay, although this eventuality did not occur. In November, the couple married at Mombasa Registry Office; here, he first used the name of &quot;Talbot Mundy&quot;, erroneously claiming to the son of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury. That month, they left Mombasa aboard the &quot;SS Natal&quot;, stopping in Djibouti and Port Said on their way to Marseilles, from where they made their way to England. There they visited Mundy&#x27;s mother in Lee-on-Solent, Hampshire, and she agreed to give Mundy a substantial sum of money; it would be the last time Mundy saw her. Mundy and his wife spent most of the money while staying in London, before leaving from Southampton aboard the &quot;SS Teutonic&quot; in September 1909, headed for the United States.

===United States and early literary career: 1909–15===

Arriving in New York City, the couple moved into a hotel room in the Gashouse District. Soon after arrival, Mundy was mugged and suffered a fractured skull, being hospitalised in Bellevue Hospital. Doctors feared that he might not survive the injury, while the perpetrator, Joseph Cavill, was indicted with first degree robbery and sentenced to six months imprisonment. Throughout 1910, Mundy worked in a series of menial jobs, being fired from several of them. His hospitalisation and poverty put great strain on his marriage, as did legal charges filed by the United States Department of Commerce and Labor accusing the couple of entering the country using false information; the charges were soon dismissed.

In 1910, he ran into Jeff Hanley, a reporter who had covered his mugging incident; Hanley was impressed by Mundy&#x27;s tales of India and Africa, and lent him a typewriter, suggesting that he write some of his stories down for potential publication. Mundy did so, and published his first short story, &quot;A Transaction in Diamonds&quot;, in the February 1911 issue of Frank Munsey&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Scrap Book&quot;. His second publication was a non-fiction article, &quot;Pig-sticking in India&quot;, which appeared in the April issue of a new pulp magazine, &quot;Adventure&quot;, which specialised in adventure fiction. Although he and &quot;Adventure&quot;&#x27;s editor Arthur Sullivant Hoffman did not initially like each other, In the May 1911 issue of Adventure his short story &#x27;The Phantom Battery&#x27; appeared. Mundy continued writing for the magazine, as well as for &quot;The Scrap Book&quot;, &quot;Argosy&quot;, and &quot;Cavalier&quot;. In 1912, Mundy published sixteen short stories and four articles in &quot;Adventure&quot;, seven of which were under the name &quot;Walter Galt&quot;. Biographer Brian Taves suggested that these early short stories are notable &quot;not so much for themselves as for how much they diverged from his later oeuvre&quot;, for instance dealing with subjects like boxing that are absent from his later work. In 1912, &quot;Adventure&quot; had also established The Adventurer&#x27;s Club, of which Mundy became a chartered member.

Mundy&#x27;s story &quot;The Soul of a Regiment&quot; attracted particular praise and critical attention. Revolving around an Egyptian regiment who are taught to play music by their English Sergeant-Instructor in the buildup to the Somaliland Campaign, it was initially published by &quot;Adventure&quot; in February 1912, before becoming the first of Mundy&#x27;s publications to be republished in Britain, appearing in the March 1912 issue of George Newnes&#x27; &quot;The Grand Magazine&quot;. Soon he would see his short stories published in a range of British publications, including &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, &quot;London Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine of Fiction&quot; as well as &quot;The Grand&quot;. 1912 also saw two cinematic adaptations of his short stories, &quot;For Valour&quot; and &quot;The Fire Cop&quot; – produced by the Edison Company and Selig Polyscope Company respectively – with both being fairly faithful to his original stories.

In June 1912, Inez sued for divorce on the grounds of Mundy&#x27;s adultery; he did not challenge the accusation and the divorce was confirmed in October. As part of the divorce settlement, Mundy was forced to pay $20 a week alimony to Inez for the rest of her life. Mundy moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village, which for a short time he shared with Hoffman&#x27;s assistant Sinclair Lewis. At this point he met the Kentucky-born portrait painter Harriette Rosemary Strafer, and after she agreed to marry him they wed in Stamford, Connecticut in August 1913. Strafer had been a practitioner of a Christian new religious movement, Christian Science, since 1904, and encouraged her new husband to take an interest in the faith; studying the writings of its founder, Mary Baker Eddy, he converted to it in 1914. The couple then moved to the town of Norway in Maine, where Mundy&#x27;s friend Hugh Pendexter was already resident. He involved himself in the activities of his new home, becoming chairman of the local agricultural committee and joining the Norway Committee on Public Safety. Following the outbreak of World War I, in which Britain went to war against Germany, Mundy sought to attain U.S. citizenship; applying in November 1914, his request was approved in March 1917.

In Norway, Mundy authored his first novel, &quot;For the Peace of India&quot;, which was set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. It was serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; under the altered title of &quot;Rung Ho!&quot; before being published by Charles Scribner in the U.S., and Cassells in the U.K. Critically well received, the book sold well. In August 1914, &quot;Adventure&quot; published &quot;The Sword of Iskander&quot;, the first of Mundy&#x27;s eight novelettes revolving around the character of Dick Anthony of Arran, a Scotsman battling the Russians in Iran, which ran until March 1915. It was in his January 1914 short story &quot;A Soldier and a Gentleman&quot; that he introduced the character of Yasmini, a young Hindu woman who would reappear in many of his later stories. He then began work on a second novel, &quot;The Winds of the World&quot;, which told the story of a Sikh officer, Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh, who sets out to expose a German spy who is attempting to foment an uprising in British India; during the course of the story he introduced Yasmini as a character. Serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; from July to September 1915, it was then published in Britain by Cassell; when Scribner declined to publish it, Mundy acquired a literary agent, Paul Reynolds. Upon publication, it received good reviews.

===&quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;: 1916–18===

Mundy authored comparatively few short stories in 1916 as he focused on his third novel, &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;, which told the story of Captain Athelstan King of the British India Secret Service and his attempt to prevent a German-backed jihad break out against the British administration in the North-West Frontier. Again, it featured Yasmini as a core character. The novel was serialised in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s&quot; from May 1916 to January 1917, accompanied by illustrations by Joseph Clement Coll, a man whom Mundy praised, declaring that &quot;there never was a better illustrator in the history of the world!&quot;. The novel was then published by U.S.-based Bobbs-Merrill in November 1916 and by U.K.-based Constable in January 1917; it received critical acclaim, with critics comparing it to the work of Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.

In 1917 only two of Mundy&#x27;s short stories appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot;; the first was a reprint of &quot;The Soul of a Regiment&quot;, while the second was a sequel, &quot;The Damned Old Nigger&quot;; in a 1918 readership survey, these were rated as the first and third most popular stories in &quot;Adventure&quot;, respectively. From October to December 1917 he serialised his fourth novel, &quot;Hira Singh&#x27;s Tale&quot;, in &quot;Adventure&quot;, which was partly based upon real events. The story revolves around a regiment of Sikhs fighting on the Western Front for the British Empire who are then captured by the Germans; transferred to a Turkish prisoner of war camp, they attempt to escape and return overland to India. Casells published a British edition in June 1918, although for American publication in book form it was renamed &quot;Hira Singh&quot;. Talbot devoted the latter to his friend Elmer Davis, and gifted a copy to the British monarch George V, who was Commander-in-Chief of the 14th Ferozepore Sikhs. The book received largely positive reviews in the U.S., although was criticised in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;. Mundy felt that many reviewers had failed to understand the main reason for the book; he had meant it to represent a tribute to the Indian soldiers who had died fighting in Europe during World War I.

In autumn 1918, Mundy and his wife moved to Fifth Avenue in New York City. That year he serialised &quot;On the Trail of Tippoo Tib&quot;, part of a series of novelettes which he termed &quot;The Up and Down the Earth Tales&quot;. Set in British East Africa prior to the First World War, it dealt with an expedition of three Englishmen and an American who search for a hidden cache of ivory. When published in book form in June, Bobbs-Merrill renamed the story &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot;. &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot; was Mundy&#x27;s most widely reviewed work, receiving a largely positive reception, and resulting in him being interviewed for the &quot;New York Evening World&quot;.

==Later life==

===Christian Science and Palestine: 1918–20===

In December 1918, Mundy and his wife had visited Indianapolis, there meeting with the team at Bobbs-Merrill, and it was here that he encountered Christian Science, a new religious movement founded by Mary Baker Eddy in the 19th century. He was convinced to advertise his books in the group&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;.
Becoming increasingly interested in the movement, he became close friends with William Denison McCrackan, who was the associated editor of both the &quot;Christian Science Journal&quot; and &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;. Mundy agreed to become the president of The Anglo-American Society, a Christian Science group devoted to providing aid for Palestine, which had recently been conquered by the British from the Ottoman Empire. He also became vice president of the Society&#x27;s magazine, &quot;New Earth News&quot;.

Spending time at the Christian Science White Mountains Camp in Tamworth, New Hampshire, it was there that he wrote &quot;The Eye of Zeitun&quot;; it included the four protagonists who had appeared in &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot; experiencing a new adventure in Armenia, and reflected Turkish persecution of the Armenian people. It was serialised in &quot;Romance&quot; from February to March 1920 before being published by Bobbs-Merrill in March under the altered title of &quot;The Eyes of Zeitoon&quot;. The book received mixed reviews and did not sell well. Although pleased with the work of his agent Paul Reynolds, he switched to Howard Wheeler, with whom he felt more comfortable.

In December 1919, Talbot decided to travel to Palestine, to aid the Society in establishing the &quot;Jerusalem News&quot;, the first-English language newspaper in the city. Departing the U.S. in January 1920 aboard the &quot;RMS Adriatic&quot;, he arrived in Southampton, before travelling to London, Rome, Alexandria, and then reaching Jerusalem in February. There he became the newspaper&#x27;s editorial assistant, being involved in writing articles, reporting on current events, proof reading, and editing. In Jerusalem, he entered a relationship with Sally Ames, a fellow Christian Scientist whom he had first met in the U.S. It was also in the city that he later claimed he had met the English writer G. K. Chesterton on the latter&#x27;s visit. Talbot witnessed the conflict between Arab and Jewish populations within the city, and was present during the Nebi Musa riots. With Ames he also visited Egypt, there traveling to the Great Pyramid of Giza and later alleging that he spent a night alone in its King&#x27;s Chamber. Having identified itself as a wartime paper, the &quot;Jerusalem News&quot; ceased publication after the transition from British military rule to the British civilian rule of Mandatory Palestine.

===Creating Jimgrim: 1920–22===

Mundy returned to New York City in August, there informing Rosemary that he wanted a divorce, which she refused. Unable to live with her, he moved into an apartment in Huguenot Park, Staten Island. There he authored &quot;Guns of the Gods&quot;, a story set in Yasmini&#x27;s youth; it was serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; from March to May, and published in book form by Bobbs-Merrill in June. The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; accused it of having a strong anti-English bias.

It was also on Staten Island that he began drawing upon his experiences of Palestine for a series of novelettes set in the region that featured a new protagonist, James Schuyler Grim, or &quot;Jimgrim&quot;. As created by Mundy, Jimgrim was an American who had been recruited by the British intelligence services because of his in-depth knowledge of Arab life. Mundy claimed that Jimgrim was based on a real individual, whose identity he refused to reveal, while later biographer Brian Taves has suggested that the character was heavily influenced by T. E. Lawrence. The first of these Jimgrim stories, &quot;The Adventure of El-Kerak&quot;, appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; in November 1921; the second, &quot;Under the Dome of the Rock&quot;, appeared in December, while the third, &quot;The &#x27;Iblis&#x27; at Ludd&quot;, appeared in January 1922. In August 1922, Mundy published &quot;A Secret Society&quot;, in which he took Jimgrim out of Palestine and sent him to Egypt. This series of novelettes promoted the cause of Arab independence from British imperialism and presented an idealised image of the prominent Arab leader Faisal I of Iraq. These early Jimgrim stories were an immediate success for &quot;Adventure&quot;, however Bobbs-Merrill were nevertheless not keen on them and urged Mundy to write something else. The company had repeatedly lent money to Mundy, who was now heavily in debt to them.

In October 1921, Mundy left New York and settled in Reno, Nevada, where Ames joined him. He initiated divorce proceedings against Rosemary in a Reno court. The case was eventually heard in August 1923, with Mundy alleging that he wanted a divorce because Rosemary had deserted him. She denied the allegations, and the judge dismissed Talbot&#x27;s case, adding that from the evidence Rosemary herself would be entitled to sue for divorce, which she nevertheless refused to do. Mundy meanwhile continued writing prolifically, producing 19 novel-length stories from 1921 through to the end of 1923, something that he found particularly tiring.

In November 1922, &quot;Adventure&quot; published Mundy&#x27;s &quot;The Gray Mahatma&quot;, which would later be republished under the title of &quot;Caves of Terror&quot;. Taves described &quot;Caves of Terror&quot; as &quot;a landmark in Mundy&#x27;s career&quot;, being &quot;one of [his] most unusual and extraordinary novels&quot;. The work included characters such as King and Yasmini who had been a part of Mundy&#x27;s early oeuvre, as well as more recently developed characters like Jeff Ramsden from his Jimgrim series.
It revealed Mundy&#x27;s growing interest in Asian religion and also introduced a number of fantasy elements not present in his earlier work. The readers of &quot;Adventure&quot; voted it as their favourite novel of the year. At this time, he also exhibited his growing interest in esoteric ideas through the letters he published in &quot;Adventure&quot;, in which he discussed his ideas about the Egyptian pyramids, the Lost Tribes of Israel, and the Ark of the Covenant.

In 1922, Mundy and Ames moved to Truckee in California, although in October he travelled to San Diego, remaining there for several months.
He had continued writing, producing &quot;The Nine Unknown&quot;, a Jimgrim novel which again exhibited Mundy&#x27;s interest in Indian religious ideas. Serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; from March to April 1923, it was published by Bobbs-Merrill in March 1924 and then in Britain by Hutchinson in June. Taves however considered it to be &quot;the most shallow and least satisfying of Mundy&#x27;s fantasies&quot;. Mundy wanted to see the publication of popular editions of his novels, viewing this as a potential source of additional income and a good means of encouraging cinematic adaptations; in 1922 Bobbs-Merrill agreed, resulting in A. L. Burt Company publishing eight Mundy novels in two years. In the United Kingdom, Hutchinson published all but one of Mundy&#x27;s then-written novels between 1922 and 1925.

===Embracing Theosophy: 1922–27===

In 1922, Mundy resigned from the Mother Church of Christian Science. He was increasingly interested in Theosophy, and on 1 January 1923 he joined the Theosophical Society Pasadena, with Ames joining later that month. He expressed the view that reading the works of Theosophy&#x27;s co-founder Helena Blavatsky &quot;stirred in me something deeper and more challenging than I had known was there and capable of being stirred.&quot; He developed a close friendship with the groups&#x27; leader Katherine Tingley, who invited him to live in her two-storey home, Wachere Crest, at the Theosophical community of Lomaland in San Diego. At Lomaland, he immersed himself in the study of Theosophy, attending lectures and plays on the subject, and eventually appearing in some of these plays and giving his own lectures, coming to be recognised as one of the Society&#x27;s most popular and charismatic public speakers.

In 1923, Mundy became part of Tingley&#x27;s cabinet, a position normally reserved for Theosophical veterans; he remained an active member of the cabinet until after Tingley&#x27;s death in 1929. Tingley invited him to contribute to &quot;The Theosophical Path&quot;, with his first article in this magazine, devoted to his time in Jerusalem, appearing in the February 1923 issue. He would be a regular contributor to the magazine through 1924 and 1925, and would continue to do so with less frequency until 1929. He also wrote a preface for Tingley&#x27;s 1925 book &quot;The Wine of Life&quot;. In June 1924, Mundy and Sally relocated to Mérida, Yucatan in Mexico for six weeks. Under Mexican law, this residence allowed Mundy to secure a divorce from his third wife, which he did in July, marrying Ames the following day. Returning to San Diego, Mundy and Ames purchased a house near to Lomaland for $25,000 in late 1924. The house — which required much renovation — was named &quot;Tilgaun&quot; by the couple, who lived there with her son Dick.

At the recommendation of director Fred Niblo, whom Mundy had known in Africa, in early 1923 the producer Thomas H. Ince hired Mundy as a screenwriter. Mundy&#x27;s first assignment for Ince was to write a novelization of the upcoming film, &quot;Her Reputation&quot;; the book was published by Bobbs-Merrill, and in England by Hutchinson under the title &quot;The Bubble Reputation&quot;. Mundy later expressed disdain for the novel, with his biographer Peter Berresford Ellis describing it as &quot;the worst book that Talbot ever wrote&quot;. For Ince, Mundy also produced a novelisation of a Western film, &quot;When Trails Were New&quot;, which dealt with the interactions between Native Americans and European settlers in the Wisconsin woodlands of 1832. He later criticised the novel, with Taves describing it as &quot;unquestionably one of Mundy&#x27;s worst stories&quot;. Mundy continued to write his own stories; in December 1922, &quot;Adventure&quot; published Mundy&#x27;s &quot;Benefit of Doubt&quot;, which was followed by a sequel, &quot;Treason&quot;, in January 1923. These stories involved the character of Athelstan King, and were set in the context of the Malabar rebellion which had taken place in Malabar in 1921. In December 1923, &quot;Adventure&quot; published Mundy&#x27;s next Jimgrim story, &quot;Mohammed&#x27;s Tooth&quot;, which would later be republished as &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;.

Mundy followed this with &quot;Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; from October to November 1924, before publication by Bobbs-Merrill. The characters were based upon individuals that he knew at Lomaland, and the story expounded Theosophical ideas regarding the Masters and the existence of a universal &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot;. &quot;Adventure&quot; included a disclaimer at the start of the story stating that they did not endorse the esoteric movement. Ellis described the work as Mundy&#x27;s &quot;most significant novel&quot;, and his &quot;literary masterpiece&quot;, while for Taves, it was &quot;his most distinctly literary book, surpassing earlier novels by exhibiting a maturing skill in choice of language, plot structure, theme, depth of character.&quot; Mundy received hundreds of letters praising the work, and it also received good critical reviews from press. It proved popular among Theosophists, with Tingley asking Mundy if he would adapt it for one of her theaters. The British edition underwent six reprints in quick succession, while Swedish and German translations were soon commissioned for publication. At the prompting of several letters, Mundy began work on a sequel, &quot;Ramsden&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; in June 1926 before being published by Bobbs-Merrill under the title of &quot;The Devils Guard&quot;. Upon publication it received good reviews. A third instalment in the trilogy, &quot;The Red Flame of Erinpura&quot;, appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; in 1927. Taves later noted that these three works reflected Theosophy&#x27;s &quot;most direct influence upon Mundy&#x27;s writing&quot;, adding that in looking to Asia not only &quot;for exoticism, but for wisdom and an alternative mode of living superior to Western habits&quot;, they &quot;reinvigorated and revitalized fantasy-adventure literature&quot;.

Mundy then moved towards historical fiction.
His next main project was the &quot;Tros Saga&quot;, a series of six novel-length stories which appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; over the course of 1925. Set in Europe during the first century BCE, the eponymous Tros was a Samothracian pirate who combats the Roman military leader Julius Caesar, who in Mundy&#x27;s novels had been responsible for the death of Tros&#x27; father. The series further reflected Mundy&#x27;s Theosophical beliefs by presenting both the Samothracians and the druids as practitioners of the &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot; religion that Theosophy propounded. Mundy&#x27;s negative portrayal of Caesar caused controversy, with various letters being published in &quot;Adventure&quot;&#x27;s opinion section debating the accuracy of Mundy&#x27;s portrayal, which included contributions from historical specialists in the period. The collected book, reaching 950 pages in length, was published in 1934 by Appleton-Century and Hutchinson, at which it proved both a critical and a commercial success.
Mundy remained with the Roman Empire for a novel focusing on the final months of the Emperor Commodus; it was serialised as &quot;The Falling Star&quot; by &quot;Adventure&quot; in October 1926 and later published in book form by Hutchinson as &quot;Caesar Dies&quot; in 1934. From 1925 to 1927 he also wrote &quot;Queen Cleopatra&quot;, a lengthy novel that both Bobbs-Merrill and Hutchinson wanted edited down before they would publish it. Moving away from the Roman Empire, Mundy wrote &quot;W.H.: A Portion of the Record of Sir William Halifax&quot;, a novel set in Tudor England which featured William Shakespeare as a supporting character. Mundy had difficulty finding a publisher for &quot;W.H.&quot;, although it was eventually serialised as &quot;Ho for London Town!&quot; in &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot; in February 1929, followed by book publication as &quot;W.H.&quot; through Hutchinson in 1831.

Turning his attention to new business ventures, he joined a syndicate, the Sindicato de Desarrollo Liafail, who were planning on drilling for oil in Tijuana, Mexico. Mundy became the syndicate&#x27;s secretary, while another key member of the group was General Abelardo L. Rodríguez, who was then Governor of Baja California, and they also secured investment from Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles. They obtained permission in September 1926 and began drilling in February 1927. The company closed in July 1931, having been a financial failure; they had failed to locate any oil and one of the syndicate&#x27;s partners proved to be a con man who had stolen much of their funds.

===Final years: 1928–40===

After the failings of the Mexican oil expedition, Mundy left for New York City in June 1928. He officially separated from Ames the following month, leaving his Tilgaun home to her. In the city he embarked on a relationship with Theda Conkey Webber—a woman he had met in the autumn of 1927—and she shortly after legally changed her name to Dawn Allen. In New York, Mundy had resumed his friendship with Natacha Rambova, whom he had first met at Point Loma. Through her he was introduced to the spirit medium George Wehner, who helped develop Mundy&#x27;s interest in Spiritualism. Mundy then wrote an introduction to Wehner&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Curious Life&quot;, reflecting his own growing interest in Spiritualism. Both Rambova and Mundy and Dawn moved into the Master Apartments building, which rented its rooms to a large number of artists and writers. Mundy became involved in Nicholas Roerich&#x27;s museum, which was located in the building, and travelled to London in order to convince the authorities to permit Roerich&#x27;s expedition to India and in to the Himalayas; they had initially been hesitant that Roerich—who was Russian by birth—may have been an intelligence agent for the Soviet Union.

In 1928, Mundy took on Brandt and Brandt as his new literary agents, becoming a close friend of co-owner Carl Brandt. At his agent&#x27;s prompting, Mundy ceased publishing with Bobbs-Merrill and switched to The Century Company, soon renamed D. Appleton-Century, who sold far more copies of his books than Bobbs-Merrill had. Both Century and Hutchinson would subsequently reissue many of Mundy&#x27;s older works in the following few years. In January 1929 he registered a new company, Jeff Ramsden Inc, with two comrades. The company engaged in a variety of activities, including purchasing real estate, copyright, and inventions, although had foundered within months. The state department officially dissolved it in December 1936 for not paying tax.

Directed by John Ford, Fox Film had produced a cinematic adaptation of &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;, titled &quot;The Black Watch&quot;. Mundy disliked it, thinking that the acting was bad and describing it as &quot;a disagreeable waste of money and an insult to the public&quot;. However, it allowed him to pay off the many debts that he owed. In March 1932, Mundy sold the film rights of &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot; to Universal Studios, who used it as the basis for &quot;Jungle Mystery&quot;, a film that was first released as a 12 episode serial and then as a full feature in 1935. In 1936, Paramount optioned &quot;Rung Ho!&quot;, although Mundy—unhappy with previous cinematic adaptations of his work—insisted on a significant level of creative control, producing a script for the film known as &quot;Fifty-Seven&quot;. 20th Century Fox also began work on their own adaptation of &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;, although this project ultimately never came to fruition.

The changing nature of the market meant that Mundy had to write an increasing number of short stories in the final decade of his life, something that he was not happy about. In this period he not only published in &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Argosy&quot; but also in a wider range of magazines, such as &quot;Blue Book&quot;, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, &quot;All Aces&quot;, and &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;. He also published work in American Sunday newspaper supplements like &quot;This Week&quot; and &quot;American Weekly&quot;, as well as in the Canadian &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, and the British &quot;Britannia and Eve&quot; and &quot;The Passing Show&quot;.

Mundy created a series of stories focusing on the character of Ben Quorn, the first instalments of which appeared in &quot;Adventure&quot; over the course of late 1928 and early 1929, the latter in &quot;Argosy&quot;. One of these, &quot;The Gunga Sahib&quot;, was set in the (fictional) Indian state of Narada. His final Quorn story was &quot;The Elephant Sahib&quot; for &quot;Argosy&quot;. 
Mundy produced a series of short stories, novelettes, and novels about the Criminal Investigation Division of India, most of which featured either Larry O&#x27;Hara or Chullunder Ghose as their protagonist. In March 1932 he published &quot;Chullunder Ghose the Guileless&quot; in &quot;Adventure&quot;.
In November 1932, Century published Mundy&#x27;s novel &quot;C.I.D.&quot;. Revolving around the character of Ghose, it featured an appearance of the Thuggee group. Unusually, it was only serialised after book publication, in &quot;Adventure&quot; during March and April 1933. Ghose&#x27;s final appearance was in &quot;The Elephant Waits&quot;, published in &quot;Short Stories&quot; in February 1937. Mundy later rewrote &quot;The Elephant Waits&quot; as the novelette &quot;The Night the Clocks Stopped&quot;, in which Ghose was removed altogether.

From October to December 1929 &quot;Adventure&quot; serialised Mundy&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Guns of Kabul&quot;, which was then published in book form as &quot;Cock O&#x27; the North&quot;. The story had originally been commissioned for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, but their editor George Horace Lorimer declined it on completion. However, he gradually ceased publishing his work with &quot;Adventure&quot; in this period, after they reduced both the number of issues that they released and the length of their publication. During these years he also wrote two novelettes for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Combined with Romance&quot; and four articles for &quot;The Theosophical Path&quot;.

At the Master Apartments, Mundy had written &quot;Black Light&quot;, and while he was unable to get it serialised, it was published by both Bobbs-Merril and Hutchinson in October 1930, to mixed reviews. The novel was set in India, and revolved around a man living under the domination of his mother. Taves referred to it as &quot;one of Mundy&#x27;s deepest and most rewarding novels&quot;. It was the last of Mundy&#x27;s novels that the company produced as he left them shortly after; the company were upset, having felt that they had been badly treated. In the following year, Mundy focused on magazine work, producing &quot;King of the World&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; from November 1930 to February 1931; it was later published in book form as &quot;Jimgrim&quot;. The story moved towards science fiction, and entailed Jimgrim battling an antagonist named Dorje, who has discovered the scientific secrets of Atlantis and is using them in an attempt to conquer the world. His novel &quot;White Tigers&quot;, which revolved around a big game hunter and a filmmaker, was serialised in &quot;Adventure&quot; in August 1932. Another novel was &quot;Full Moon&quot;, which told the story of a secret police officer investigating the disappearance of a brigadier in India. Serialised in &quot;The American Weekly&quot; from October 1934 to January 1935, it was described by Taves as &quot;perhaps the most intensely mythic and symbolic of all Mundy&#x27;s work&quot;.

Mundy had also revived his Tros stories, producing four novelettes featuring the character which were published in &quot;Adventure&quot; from March to October 1935: &quot;Battle Stations&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Promise&quot;, &quot;The Purple Pirate&quot; and &quot;Fleets of Fire&quot;, all of which were then published in a collected volume titled &quot;Purple Pirate&quot;. Mundy returned to the setting of Tibet for two of his final novels, &quot;The Thunder Dragon Gate&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Old Ugly Face&quot;, which featured the adventures of the American Tom Grange who combatted attempts by the Russian, Japanese, and German governments to seize control of the Himalayan kingdom. &quot;The Thunder Dragon Gate&quot; was serialised in &quot;The American Weekly&quot; from January to March 1937 before publication by Appleton-Century and Hutchinson, with &quot;Old Ugly Face&quot; being serialised in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; between April and May 1938 before a 1940 publication by Hutchinson.
Another of Mundy&#x27;s final novels was &quot;East and West&quot;, a melodrama set in India that Mundy designed with cinematic adaptation in mind.

In 1929 he proceeded on a visit to Europe with Dawn, spending time in London, Paris, and Rome before returning to New York.
Mundy and Dawn proceeded to Mexico via Cuba, settling in Yucatan, where they visited Maya archaeological sites like Chichen Itza and Uxmal before Mundy secured a divorce there in July 1931. He and Dawn married shortly after in Campeche City. They subsequently visited Europe, spending time in Hamburg before driving to Mallorca to visit Rambova, who had settled there with a new husband. During this holiday, Mundy authored a non-fiction philosophical book, &quot;Thus Spake the Devil&quot;, in which he brought in ideas from both Christian Science and Theosophy. He sent it to publishers under a pseudonym, but at the time it was rejected; it would be posthumously published as &quot;I Say Sunrise&quot; in 1947. There, Dawn discovered that she was pregnant with Mundy&#x27;s child, with the couple heading to England, where she was hospitalised at the Theosophist-run Stonefield Hospital in Blackheath, Kent. Their daughter was born there in February, although died an hour later as a result of a heart malformation. To recover, the couple spent time with Mundy&#x27;s cousins in Surrey, from where Mundy visited his brother in Hythe. They sailed back to the U.S. from Marseilles in late 1933.

Amid the economic problems of the Great Depression, Mundy began seeking out alternative forms of income to supplement his writing, beginning to give occasional lectures. He also began regularly writing scripts for the radio show &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;, producing around seven hundred scripts in all; these brought in a regular income until his death. At certain points he introduced Theosophical ideas into the radio serial, although nevertheless felt that by producing such &quot;grossly commercial&quot; material he had prostituted himself.

In the summer of 1933 they had arrived back in the U.S., and in autumn moved into a cottage near to Osprey, Florida, where their friend Rose Wilder Lane came to stay.
In September 1934 they returned to the Northeast, settling into Dawn&#x27;s parental home in South Manchester, Connecticut, where they remained until 1938.
In 1939 Mundy and his wife moved to Anna Maria Island in Manatee County, Florida. There he was diagnosed with diabetes, a disease that had also afflicted many of his family members. 
Mundy retained an interest in political developments in Europe, and was critical of both fascism and Marxism-Leninism, characterising Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. After World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939, Mundy advocated for the U.S. to join the conflict in support of the U.K. and France.
Mundy died at home, during sleep, on 5 August 1940, aged 61. The certifying doctor attributed his death to myocardial insufficiency brought on by diabetes. His body was cremated on 6 August at Baynard Crematorium in St. Petersburg, Florida. Obituaries marking his passing appeared in both the American and British press.

==Personal life==

Mundy was married five times during his life. His only biological child died stillborn, although he was a kind and indulgent stepfather to Dick Ames, the son of his fourth wife. He was known to be very generous to his family and to his friends within the Theosophical movement. His sense of humour allowed him to laugh at himself, and he was open about his own failings and shortcomings. Mundy worked seven hours a day, six days a week, typically arising at three or four in the morning.
Mundy never produced a written outline of his stories prior to writing them. Very proud of his poetry, Mundy liked to insert a proverb or verse at the start of each chapter in his novels.
He had been a heavy cigarette smoker throughout his life—at some points smoking fifty a day—although he quit the habit in 1936 after an illness. 
Ellis described Mundy as &quot;a strange, enigmatic personality&quot;, noting that in early life he had been described as &quot;a wastrel, confidence-trickster, barefaced liar and a womanizer&quot; but that in later life he had changed his &quot;philosophical approach to life ... and become better for it&quot;.

Mundy was fascinated by mysticism, and explored various religions throughout his life. After a brief involvement in Christian Science, he joined the Theosophical movement and also became very interested in Buddhism. Taves stated that through his literature, Mundy was &quot;engaged in a lifelong discourse on philosophy and religion&quot;, including Eastern ideas on subjects like karma and reincarnation which would later be popularised by the New Age Movement.

Mundy also had strong political views, expressing contempt for the British establishment and promoting an egalitarian ethos, although not so far as to become a socialist. He had been a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal although in the final years of his life became more politically conservative. The key political issue that he confronted in his work was colonialism, and he opposed imperialism regardless of the country committing it; his work contains negative portrayals of imperialistic activity by both contemporary nation-states like Britain, Russia, and Japan, as well as by the ancient Roman Empire. In keeping with his critical attitude toward the British Empire, Mundy expressed support for Indian independence.
Ellis claimed that unlike many of his contemporaries, Mundy&#x27;s work has not been accused of adopting a racialist attitude toward non-caucasian peoples. However, Taves believed that Mundy&#x27;s depictions of indigenous Africans in &quot;The Ivory Trail&quot; were &quot;hardly free of racism&quot; from a contemporary perspective, but that they nevertheless were &quot;certainly enlightened&quot; for his time, adding that Mundy &quot;unquestionably respected black humanity&quot; and abhorred white supremacism.

Mundy believed in the equality of men and women. Biographer Brian Taves felt that Mundy exhibited feminist sympathies in his work, suggesting that Yasmini, the strong, independent Hindu character that he developed in 1914, was clear evidence of this. He further added that throughout the series, female characters are frequently &quot;the leading players in his stories, ambitious, likeable, out-thinking and dominating men,&quot; with these female depictions typically being &quot;believable [and] multi-dimensional&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

Over the course of his career, Mundy produced 47 novels, 130 novelettes and short stories, and 23 articles, as well as one non-fiction book. Mundy biographer Peter Berresford Ellis described him as &quot;one of the bestselling writers of adventure-fiction of his day&quot;, while Taves characterised him as &quot;the most influential and enduring, if not the best-selling, writer of Eastern adventure of his day&quot;. Mundy was best known for &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; although his most critically acclaimed book was &quot;Om&quot;, and he personally considered &quot;Old Ugly Face&quot; to be his magnum opus. His work has been translated into a variety of European and Asian languages.

During his lifetime, Mundy&#x27;s work was often compared with that of H. Rider Haggard and Rudyard Kipling, both of whose careers overshadowed his own. This was a comparison that Mundy himself disliked. Taves noted that while Kipling&#x27;s work is typically seen as the model for colonial literature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Talbot offers &quot;a significant counter-example&quot;, for he was writing &quot;for the same readers and within a similar framework, [but] he was not only overtly anti-colonial but also championed Eastern philosophy and culture.&quot; Taves expressed the view that Mundy&#x27;s work was &quot;free from prejudice&quot; even though the latter did &quot;occasionally indulge in stereotyped remarks&quot; within his stories. Taves believed that the &quot;closest parallel&quot; to Mundy was Joseph Conrad because both included philosophical concerns within their adventure fiction, however he added that Conrad&#x27;s &quot;bleaker currents of literary modernism&quot; contrasted with Mundy&#x27;s &quot;hopeful conclusions&quot;.

Mundy&#x27;s work witnessed a posthumous growth of fan interest, with Taves describing this as a &quot;devoted but necessarily limited following&quot;. In the early 1950s, 20th Century Fox worked on a further adaptation of &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;, directed by Henry King. In 1955, Bradford M. Day compiled the first bibliography of his work, later releasing a revised version in 1978. In 1958–59, a number of Mundy&#x27;s books were re-released by Gnome Press, while in 1967–71 Avon brought out an array of mass-market paperbacks.
In 1983, Donald M. Grant published an edited collection of Mundy&#x27;s work, &quot;Talbot Mundy, Messenger of Destiny&quot;, which also featured a bibliography and essays from two fantasy authors, Darrel Crombie and Fritz Leiber. That same year, Grant published Ellis&#x27; biography of Mundy, which was based on the Bobbs-Merrill correspondence held at Indiana University. Also in 1983, the writer-director Philip Kaufman and the producer Steve Roth announced plans for an adaptation of some of Mundy&#x27;s novels, to be called &quot;Jimgrim vs. the Nine Unknown&quot;. The project was shelved after the financers, Tri-Star, pulled out following the commercial failure of Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. In 1995, Mark Jaqua assembled Mundy&#x27;s articles on Theosophy into a single volume, &quot;The Lama&#x27;s Law&quot;. In 1998, the first website devoted to Mundy was established; it had been created by R. T. Gaut, who ran it until his death.

Mundy&#x27;s work has been very influential on later writers. Those who have cited him as an influence on their own work include Robert E. Howard, E. Hoffman Price, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, and H. Warner Munn. Other science-fiction and fantasy writers who cited Mundy as an influence included Andre Norton, Jeremy Lane, L. Sprague de Camp, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Daniel Easterman. James Hilton&#x27;s novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was partly inspired by Mundy&#x27;s work. S.M. Stirling&#x27;s 2002 alternate-history novel &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot; is inspired by Mundy&#x27;s adventure novels, and several of its characters share names with those of Mundy&#x27;s (e.g. Athelstane King and Yasmini), albeit with different backstories (since the novel is set in a parallel 2025 in which Europe was destroyed in a natural disaster, making India the seat of the British Empire).

<text>Eugene Hale (June 9, 1836October 27, 1918) was a Republican United States Senator from Maine.

==Biography==
Born in Turner, Maine, he was educated in local schools and at Maine&#x27;s Hebron Academy. He was admitted to the bar in 1857 and served for nine years as prosecuting attorney for Hancock County, Maine. He was elected to the Maine Legislature 1867–1868, to the U.S. House of Representatives 1869–1879, serving in the 41st and four succeeding Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1878 to the 46th Congress.

Hale was served as a member of the National Monetary Commission. He was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Theta chapter).

===Blaine faction politics===

During the 1876 United States presidential election, Hale, along with future senatorial colleague William P. Frye, served as campaign managers for James G. Blaine at the Republican National Convention. Following the corrupt election that installed Republican Rutherford B. Hayes as president following the Compromise of 1877, Blaine, who supported Hayes in the general election, requested the nomination of a New England Republican into a cabinet officer position. At the house of John Sherman, Blaine called for President Hayes to nominate Frye as United States Attorney General. Hayes instead offered to appoint Hale to a cabinet position, countering Blaine&#x27;s wishes to succeed senator Hannibal Hamlin with Hale.

Hale was a member of the Blaine section, acolytes of James G. Blaine who expressed antipathy towards policies pursued by President Hayes. The faction, a part of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, particularly opposed Hayes&#x27; nomination of staunch reformer Carl Schurz to the position of United States Secretary of the Interior.
Although he declined the post of United States Secretary of the Navy in the Rutherford B. Hayes administration (and had previously declined a Cabinet appointment under Ulysses S. Grant), Senator Hale performed constructive work of the greatest importance in the area of naval appropriations, especially during the early fights for the &quot;new Navy.&quot; &quot;I hope,&quot; he said in 1884, &quot;that I shall not live many years before I shall see the American Navy what it ought to be, the pet of the American people.&quot; Much later in his career, he opposed the building of large numbers of capital ships, which he regarded as less effective in proportion to cost and subject to rapid obsolescence.

In the 1880 United States presidential election, Blaine once again sought the presidency. Hale and Frye once again became his lieutenants in the campaign. The Blaine faction came to blows with the &quot;Stalwart&quot; faction led by Roscoe Conkling, John A. Logan, and Simon Cameron, which advocated the nomination of former president Ulysses S. Grant for a third, non-consecutive presidential term. The irreconcilable bitterness between Conkling and Blaine fueled hostility between the two groups. Hale and Frye were described as &quot;too amateurish and provincial&quot; to . The Blaine faction later formed an alliance with the &quot;Half-Breed&quot; faction to thwart the Stalwarts and nominate Ohio dark horse candidate James A. Garfield, who won the general election against Democratic opponent Winfield Scott Hancock.

In 1881, Hamlin resigned from the United States Senate. Hale, who left Congress following defeat at the hands of the Greenback Party previously in 1878, competed with Frye for the open seat. Due to Frye then having still retained his House seat in contrast to Hale not being office at the time, the latter was given the Senate post. Frye later succeeded Blaine to serve in the Senate, and the two became colleagues in the upper chamber.

Hale received an LL.D. from Bates College in 1882. In 1883, Hale joined Hannibal E. Hamlin, the son of the former vice president, and started the small law firm Hale &amp; Hamlin in Ellsworth, Maine, which is now recognized as Maine&#x27;s oldest law firm.

===Senatorial career, later life===
During the late 1890s, Hale and Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts were the most vocal opponents of American intervention into the ongoing insurrection in Cuba. Hale disdained expansionism and jingoism and often challenged claims made by senators on Cuban military victories and Spanish atrocities. He so frequently engaged in verbal jousts with Cuban sympathizers in the Senate that they unfairly accused him of parroting Spanish propaganda and called him &quot;The Senator from Spain.&quot;

Senator Hale retired from politics in 1911 and spent the remainder of his life in Ellsworth, Maine, and in Washington, D.C., where he died. He is buried in Woodbine Cemetery, Ellsworth, Maine.

Two ships were named USS &quot;Hale&quot; for him. He was the father of Frederick Hale, also a U.S. senator from Maine, and of diplomat Chandler Hale.

Gertrude Atherton&#x27;s novel &quot;Senator North&quot; (1900) was based on Eugene Hale.

<doc id="1166966" wikidata="Q435167" url="?curid=1166966" title="Lucius Munatius Plancus">
<text>Lucius Munatius Plancus () was a Roman senator, consul in 42 BC, and censor in 22 BC with Paullus Aemilius Lepidus. He is one of the classic historical examples of men who have managed to survive very dangerous circumstances by constantly shifting their allegiances. Beginning his career under Julius Caesar, he allied with his assassin Decimus Junius Brutus in 44 BC, then with the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, joining Mark Antony in 40 BC, and deserting him for Octavian in 32 BC. He also founded the cities of Augusta Raurica (now Augst) and Lugdunum (now Lyon). is still visible at Gaeta.

==Early career==
Plancus was born in Tibur, the son of his homonymous father, of whom very little is known. He had three brothers and a sister: two of the brothers pursued public lives, one ascending to the praetorship and the other reaching the plebeian tribunate. He must have entered public life with election as quaestor some time before 54 BC.

More concrete information on Plancus&#x27; career only appears when he became one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s legates during the Gallic Wars: he served under Caesar in Gaul from 54 BC through to the start of Caesar&#x27;s civil war in January 49 BC. At the start of the civil war, he joined with Caesar against Pompey; he served under Caesar with Gaius Fabius (the praetor in 58 BC) during Caesar&#x27;s Illerda campaign. He sailed with Caesar to Africa in 47 BC; this year he likely was one of the praetors. When Caesar left for Spain in 45 BC, Plancus was appointed one of the prefects of the city in place of quaestors and aediles who had not been elected that year. Upon Caesar&#x27;s return from Spain, he appointed Plancus governor of Transalpine Gaul &quot;pro consule&quot; in early 44 BC.

== Transition to empire ==
Upon the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC, Plancus was still in Rome. In the immediate aftermath of the deed, he – like many other Caesarians – supported amnesty for the tyrannicides and departed for his province. He must have also supported preservation of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;acta&quot;, which would have been in service to his own career as well, as Caesar had before his death designated Plancus as one of the consuls for 42 BC. There, he raised more men while keeping a close eye on political developments in the city. He also campaigned in Raetia, winning some victories, for which he was proclaimed &quot;imperator&quot;, by September.

=== Formation of the triumvirate ===
A political crisis unfolded over the year 44 BC. Plancus and Decimus Junius Brutus were the governors of Transalpine and Cisalpine Gaul, respectively. Mark Antony, then one of the consuls, used soldiers to intimidate the assembly in passing a law in June transferring those provinces to himself. Antony left on 28 November 44 BC seeking to take those provinces from their governors. Soon afterwards, Cicero was writing to the governors already stationed there seeking military support to resist Antony&#x27;s assumption of the provinces; he wrote both to Plancus and Decimus Brutus. On 20 December 44 BC, the senate decreed that the existing governors should resist Antony by force if necessary. His funerary inscription attests that around this time he founded the cities of Augusta Raurica (44 BC) and Lugdunum (Lyon) (43 BC) and in June 43 BC, some letters attest to his passage through the village of Cularo (present Grenoble) in the Dauphiné Alps.

Plancus was slow to respond to the senate&#x27;s call to arms. Responding months later in March 43 BC, he publicly warned against the rush to war. Privately, he wrote to Cicero that he was preparing his legions and auxiliaries. While both sides were preparing forces, it is clear that Plancus was entertaining offers from both Cicero in the senate and Antony. Around the same time a further message arrived from Plancus publicly declaring for the senate, Antony asserted in a letter to Rome that he had Plancus&#x27; support. Plancus defended his caution with the argument that declaring too rashly before preparations would have meant swift consequences like those that befell Decimus Brutus (then besieged in Mutina).

The senate sent three commanders, the two consuls and Caesar&#x27;s heir Octavian after Antony. They defeated Antony on 21 April 43 BC at the Battle of Mutina; but both consuls were killed. After the battle, Plancus sought to persuade Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to join with the senate. After Lepidus joined Antony on 29 May, Plancus retreated across the river Isara and sought to join forces with Decimus, his co-consul designate for 42 BC and a high-profile tyrannicide. Lepidus sent a message to the senate blaming his soldiers for forcing his defection; at the same time, Octavian refused to cooperate with Decimus Brutus, ostensibly due to his soldiers refusing to help an assassin of Caesar. In the last letter from Plancus to Cicero, he castigates Cicero&#x27;s strategy of elevating Octavian, who was by then well known to be seeking one of the vacant consulships and, by inaction, allowing Antony to regain strength.

Three weeks after this last letter, Octavian&#x27;s soldiers marched on Rome and engineered his election as suffect consul with Quintus Pedius. Pedius&#x27; passage of the &quot;lex Pedia&quot; which sentenced the tyrannicides to exile &quot;in absentia&quot; changed Plancus&#x27; calculations; after a few months of cooperation with Decimus, he broke off. While Antony was angry at Plancus for his having sided with the senate, he was able to parley his five legions and Gallic cavalry into keeping his consulship and a triumph.

=== Under the Triumvirate ===
After Octavian joined with Antony and Lepidus to form the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC through passage of the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, they and their main allies all gave one close family member or friend to the proscriptions. Plancus is said to have put his brother – Lucius Plotius Plancus – on the death lists. For the victories he won over the Gauls in Raetia, he celebrated a triumph on 29 December 43 BC. Thereafter, he held the consulship of 42 BC with Lepidus. During his consulship, he brought legislation to overturn some of the names on the Second Triumvirate&#x27;s proscription lists and distributed land to veterans near Beneventum.

The next year, he continued supervising colonisation near Beneventum and, during the Perusine War, assisted Lucius Antony in defeating one of Octavian&#x27;s legions. After the defeat of the plot, he fled with Antony&#x27;s wife Fulvia to Greece. After the peace of Brundisium in 40 BC healed the rift between Octavian and Antony, he was assigned to Asia &quot;pro consule&quot;. He likely stayed in Asia through 38 BC.

=== Service under and defection from Antony ===
During Mark Antony&#x27;s expedition in 36 BC, to Armenia and Parthia to avenge Crassus&#x27; death from 17 years earlier, he was proconsular governor (or perhaps legate) of Syria. He was blamed for ordering the execution of Sextus Pompey in Antony&#x27;s name after Sextus was caught attempting to flee to Parthia via Asia.

Plancus deserted Antony&#x27;s side in 32 BC. The reasons are unclear. Ronald Syme speculated that he did so merely because he calculated Octavian was in the stronger position. However, Octavian&#x27;s victory was likely not yet clear in 32 BC. Plancus and his nephew Marcus Titius were instrumental in securing for Octavian the contents of Antony&#x27;s will, which gravely damaged Antony&#x27;s reputation. Complimentary sources, such as Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot; 1.7, praise Plancus for having realised the falsity of Antony&#x27;s promises and having returned virtuously to the side of Rome and Italy.

==Under Augustus==
In January 27 BC, Plancus, as one of the senior ex-consuls, brought a motion suggestion that Octavian adopt the title Augustus.

His last political office was held in 22 BC, after Augustus appointed him and Aemilius Lepidus Paullus as censors. Their censorship is famous not for any remarkable deeds, but because it was the last time that such magistrates were appointed. According to Velleius Paterculus&#x27; Roman history, it was a shame for both of the senators:

In Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Life of Nero&quot;, we read that the emperor Nero&#x27;s grandfather, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, whose wife was Antonia Major, daughter of Mark Antony, &quot;was haughty, extravagant, and cruel, and when he was only an aedile, forced the censor Lucius Plancus to make way for him on the street&quot;; the story seems to hint at the poor reputation Plancus held after his censorship.

==Legacy==
=== Tomb and family ===
Plancus died in Gaeta and is one of the very few important Roman historical figures whose tomb has survived and is identifiable, although his body has long since vanished. The Mausoleum of Plancus, a massive cylindrical tomb now much restored (and consecrated to the Virgin Mary in the late 19th century), is in Gaeta, on a hill overlooking the sea: it houses a small permanent exhibit in honor of him.

Plancus&#x27; children included one son and one daughter. His son was Lucius Munatius Plancus (ca 45 BC - aft. 14), consul in AD 13 and legate in 14, who married Aemilia Paulla, daughter of Paullus Aemilius Lepidus and wife Cornelia. In AD 14 the son went to Germany to help suppress the Rhine legions&#x27; mutiny with little success. Plancus&#x27; daughter Munatia Plancina (ca 35 BC - aft. 20) married the infamous Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, and they had two sons, Gnaeus and Marcus Piso. Plancina and her husband were accused of poisoning Germanicus. In Syria, she offended common sensibility by attending cavalry exercises and hired a notorious poisoner. After the death of Germanicus, Piso and Plancina first tried to take back control of the province, then slowly returned to Rome, where they were put on trial for fomenting civil war and for poisoning Germanicus. Eventually Livia intervened to save Plancina and she was pardoned. Many years later in AD 34 she was again prosecuted and driven to suicide. Her two sons survived her. Gnaeus Piso had to change his name to Lucius Piso, but later became governor of Africa in AD 39 under Caligula. The charges against Marcus Piso were dismissed by Tiberius.

=== Reputation ===
Plancus has a negative reputation in both ancient texts and modern scholarship. Cicero, writing a letter in late 44 BC told him that he was &quot;too much at the service of the times&quot;. The specific meaning of Cicero&#x27;s words are debated; Mitchell argues that &quot;the times&quot; in that sentence refers to Caesar&#x27;s &quot;dominatio&quot; over the state rather than a generalised lack of principle.

The history of Velleius Paterculus was very hostile to Plancus. He blamed Plancus for his brother&#x27;s death and paints his defection from Antony in 32 BC in terms being a pathological traitor with no political principles. He also painted Plancus as a fawning flatterer of Cleopatra, as greedy, and as furthering Antony&#x27;s poor judgement. For his triumph over the Gauls in 43 BC the soldiers coined a pun on him alluding that he did not celebrate over the Gauls but over his brother. Velleius&#x27; account may be derived from Gaius Asinius Pollio&#x27;s speeches; criticism of Plancus is usually coupled with praise with Pollio.

Ronald Syme, in &quot;Roman Revolution&quot; memorably savaged him: &quot;A nice calculation of his own interests and an assiduous care for his own safety carried him through well-timed treacheries to a peaceful old age&quot;. While more recent scholarship has perhaps softened slightly, Plancus&#x27; career is still largely seen in terms of flexibly adapting to prevailing circumstances out of self-interest.

<text>Little Sodbury is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Horton, in the South Gloucestershire district, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England. It is located between Chipping Sodbury, to the west, Old Sodbury to the south, Badminton, and the A46 road to the east and Horton and Hawkesbury Upton, to the north. In 2011 the parish had a population of 113. On 1 April 2023 the parish was abolished and merged with Horton.

The &quot;manor of Sodbury&quot; comprises the nearby Chipping Sodbury and Old Sodbury: it is distinct from that of Little Sodbury.

Little Sodbury&#x27;s Iron Age hill fort reshaped by the Romans is accessible from the village via the Cotswold Way at . There is a Royal Observer Corps post at . Little Sodbury is one of three Thankful Villages in Gloucestershire – those rare places that suffered no fatalities during the Great War of 1914 to 1918.

The 15th century Little Sodbury Manor was the home of Sir John Walsh who employed William Tyndale as chaplain and tutor to his grandchildren in 1522–23; by tradition he began his translation of the Bible in his bedroom here. The manor retains the porch and Great Hall, with a timber roof resting on corbels carved as shield-bearing angels, of the fifteenth-century courtyard house. The house fell into disrepair in the nineteenth century, but was restored by architect Sir Harold Brakspear for Lord Grosvenor and later Baron de Tuyll.

St Adeline&#x27;s Church was built in 1859 by William James.

<text>Lucia Francisca &quot;Susi&quot; Susanti Haditono (; born 11 February 1971) is an Indonesian retired badminton player. Relatively small of stature, she combined quick and graceful movement with elegant shotmaking technique, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest women&#x27;s singles players of all time. She was the inaugural Olympic women&#x27;s badminton champion and the first Indonesian Olympic gold medalist.

== Career ==
Susanti won the women&#x27;s singles gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain and the bronze medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, United States. She retired from the world badminton circuit not long after her marriage, in February 1997, to Alan Budikusuma, who had also won a badminton singles gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Susanti was the most dominant women&#x27;s singles player in the first half of the 1990s, winning the All England Open in 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1994, the World Badminton Grand Prix Finals five consecutive times from 1990 to 1994 as well as in 1996, and the IBF World Championships in 1993. She is the only female player to hold the Olympic, World Championship, and All-England singles titles simultaneously. She won the Japan Open three times and the Indonesian Open six times. She also won numerous Badminton Grand Prix series events and five Badminton World Cups. She led the Indonesian team to victory over perennial champion China in the 1994 and 1996 Uber Cup (women&#x27;s world team) competitions. All of this came during a relatively strong period in women&#x27;s international badminton. Her chief competitors early in her prime years were the Chinese players Tang Jiuhong and Huang Hua, and, later, China&#x27;s Ye Zhaoying and the Korean Bang Soo-hyun.

Susanti was inducted into the International Badminton Federation (IBF, currently BWF) Hall of Fame in May 2004, and received the Herbert Scheele Trophy in 2002. She lit the flame at the 2018 Asian Games opening ceremony.

== Playing style ==
Susanti was an extremely durable defensive player who liked to instigate long rallies to wear down her opponent&#x27;s stamina and invite errors. That style was in contrast to most of the top female players of her time such as Bang Soo-hyun, Tang Jiuhong, Huang Hua, and Ye Zhaoying, who employed a more aggressive style.

Susanti&#x27;s matches against top-tier opponents were characteristically slow-paced and long, especially in the era of 15 points system when a player could only earn a point when she or he held the serve. Susanti relied on deep clears to the back line, limiting the chance of a fast-paced exchange, mixed with tight drop shots, forcing her opponent to cover the entire court. Susanti frequently covered her backhand side with overhead forehands, by relying on her quickness and back-arching suppleness. Relatively short, she often stretched her legs very wide to take low shots at the corners or away from her position. Developed from training, this leg-stretching, almost balletic maneuver became a signature pose which sometimes ended with a full leg split. In the later years of her career, Susanti incorporated more smashing into her repertoire, enough to throw off opponents expecting only a game of attrition.

== Personal life ==
She is married to Alan Budikusuma (), a men&#x27;s badminton Olympic gold medalist (also in 1992) and one of the top men&#x27;s players in the history of the sport, a former Chinese Indonesian badminton player who excelled at the world level from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Together they have three children, Laurencia Averina, born 1999, Albertus Edward, born 2000, Sebastianus Fredrick, born 2003. When the eldest daughter was born, Indonesia was rocked by a series of civil outbreaks and violence. Susanti decided to name her daughter Laurencia Averina Wiratama, which means “peace”, hoping that she would bring about peace in the nation.

==In popular culture==
A biopic in Indonesian based on Susanti&#x27;s life story, entitled &quot;Susi Susanti: Love All&quot; directed by Sim F with Laura Basuki playing the titular role and Dion Wiyoko as Alan Budikusuma was released on 24 October 2019.

<doc id="1166981" wikidata="Q700483" url="?curid=1166981" title="Atomised">
<text>Atomised, also known as The Elementary Particles (), is a novel by the French author Michel Houellebecq, published in France in 1998. It tells the story of two half-brothers, Michel and Bruno, and their mental struggles against their situations in modern society. It was translated into English by Frank Wynne as &quot;Atomised&quot; in the UK and as &quot;The Elementary Particles&quot; in the US. It won the International Dublin Literary Award for writer and translator.

==Plot==
Despite the essentially elaborate scope of the plot revealed in the novel&#x27;s conclusion, the narrative focuses almost exclusively on the bleak and unrewarding day-to-day lives of the protagonists, two half-brothers who barely know each other.
They seem devoid of love, and in their loveless or soon-to-be loveless journeys, Bruno becomes a saddened loner, wrecked by his upbringing and failure to individuate, while Michel&#x27;s pioneering work in cloning removes love from the process of reproduction. Humans are proved, in the end, to be just particles and just as bodies decay (a theme in the book) they can also be created from particles.

The story unfolds as a sort of framed narrative, so despite the events described therein having taken place mostly in 1999, the story is essentially set some fifty or so years in the future. A similar device was used by Kurt Vonnegut in the novel &quot;Galápagos&quot;; however, unlike Vonnegut, Houellebecq only reveals the frame to the reader in the epilogue. Large sections of the story are presented in the form of suppertime storytelling dialogues between Michel, his childhood sweetheart Annabelle, Bruno, and Bruno&#x27;s post-divorce girlfriend Christiane.

The story focuses on the lives of Bruno Clément and Michel Djerzinski, two French half-brothers born of a hippie-type mother. Michel is raised by his paternal grandmother and becomes an introverted molecular biologist, who is ultimately responsible for the discoveries which lead to the elimination of sexual reproduction.
Bruno&#x27;s upbringing is much more tragic as described: shuffled and forgotten from one abusive boarding school to another, he eventually finds himself in a loveless marriage and teaching at a high school. Bruno grows into a lecherous and insatiable sex addict whose dalliances with prostitutes and sex chat on Minitel do nothing to satisfy him, to the point where he finds himself on disability leave from his job and in a mental hospital after a failed attempt at seducing one of his students.

==Reception==
The novel sold hundreds of thousands of copies and propelled Houellebecq into the French intellectual and literary spotlight during the summer and autumn of 1998. The vivid, almost pornographic, sexual descriptions were a frequent target of criticism, and Houellebecq himself attracted both scorn and praise for his erratic proclamations and behaviour in television interviews and the like. The author was eventually awarded the Prix Novembre in recognition of the novel. He became the last one to get this prize under this name. Philippe Dennery, the founder of the Prix Novembre, disapproved of awarding the prize to Houellebecq and resigned; the prize got a new patron—Pierre Bergé—and a new name: Prix Décembre. It was generally well-received among British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Independent&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; review under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. Globally, &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;No consensus. A fair amount of enthusiasm, though almost all are put off by some aspects of the book (the sex, the darkness, the writing, the characters). Many like what Houellebecq is trying to do, fewer how he goes about it&quot;.

In April 2008, Houellebecq&#x27;s estranged mother, Lucie Ceccaldi, returned to France to publish &quot;The Innocent One&quot;, a rebuttal of his alleged mis-characterization of her parenting as contained in the novel. In press interviews, she promised that &quot;if he has the misfortune of sticking my name on anything again he&#x27;ll get my walking stick in his face and that&#x27;ll knock his teeth out.&quot;

==Film adaptations==

A film version premiered at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival and won the Silver Bear award. The German film &quot;Elementarteilchen&quot; was directed by Oskar Roehler, and had reportedly been sold to distributors in 23 countries within days of its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival. The cast includes Moritz Bleibtreu (Bruno), Christian Ulmen (Michel), Franka Potente (Annabelle), and Martina Gedeck (Christiane).

France 2 produced the television film &quot;The Elementary Particles&quot; which was directed by Antoine Garceau and stars Guillaume Gouix and Jean-Charles Clichet. It was broadcast on 31 January 2022.

<text>The Waranga Dam is a major earthfill embankment dam with an uncontrolled spillway located approximately north of Melbourne in the North Central region of the Australian state of Victoria. The impounded off-stream reservoir is Waranga Basin and forms part of the Goulburn River irrigation system, irrigating an area of . The dam and reservoir are located in Shire of Campaspe near the City of Greater Shepparton and is located north-east of , south-west of Tatura, and near . When full, the reservoir covers an area of .

The area now covered by the Waranga Basin includes a swamp that was known as &quot;Warranga&quot; (an indigenous word) or Gunn&#x27;s after William Gunn, one of the early pastoralists who established his squatting run, also called Waranga, in the area surrounding the swamp. William Gunn was a Braehour Gunn who emigrated to Victoria in 1853 from Wick, Scotland. His half-brother was the Honourable Donald Gunn of Manitoba, Canada. Gold was discovered near Waranga Swamp in 1853, making it one of Victoria&#x27;s oldest goldfields.

==Construction==
Construction of the earth dam began in 1905 and was completed in 1915 using picks, shovels and horse-drawn scoops. The site of the basin was a former swamp in the then Waranga Shire. Construction of the dam was commissioned by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria for the irrigation of the Western Goulburn Valley. At the time of construction, the Waranga Basin embankment was described as the largest project of its sort in the world with an embankment height of and length of .

Between 1915 and 1926, the embankment was raised in stages and a core wall was inserted. By 1921, the embankment was raised to allowing the storage capacity to be increased to , its current capacity. The major road between Tatura and Rushworth crosses the outlet.

==Distribution of the water==
Waranga Basin stores water flowing downstream from Lake Eildon as well as having a catchment area of its own. Waranga Basin supplies water to the Central Goulburn Irrigation Area and Rochester Irrigation Area. However, the Waranga Western Channel takes some of the water to Pyramid Hill and Boort. Goulburn–Murray Water is responsible for regulating the flow of water from the basin.

Normally, only about three-quarters of the can be used in irrigation. However, in 2002–03, an additional were pumped to the Goulburn Irrigation System to assist farmers experiencing severe drought.

<text>Indirect injection in an internal combustion engine is fuel injection where fuel is not directly injected into the combustion chamber. 

Gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein a fuel injector delivers the fuel at some point before the intake valve, have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford have developed a &#x27;dual injection&#x27; system, combining direct injectors with port (indirect) injectors, combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection. Direct injection allows the fuel to be precisely metered into the combustion chamber under high pressure which can lead to greater power and fuel efficiency. The issue with direct injection is that it typically leads to greater amounts of particulate matter and with the fuel no longer contacting the intake valves, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves over time. Adding indirect injection keeps fuel spraying on the intake valves, reducing or eliminating the carbon accumulation on intake valves and in low load conditions, indirect injection allows for better fuel-air mixing. This system is mainly used in higher cost models due to the added expense and complexity. 

Port injection refers to the spraying of the fuel onto the back of the intake valve, which speeds its evaporation.

An indirect injection diesel engine delivers fuel into a chamber off the combustion chamber, either a prechamber or swirl chamber, where combustion begins and then spreads into the main combustion chamber. The prechamber is carefully designed to ensure adequate mixing of the atomized fuel with the compression-heated air.

==Gasoline engines==
An advantage of indirect injection gasoline engines versus direct injection gasoline engines is that deposits on intake valves from the crankcase ventilation system are washed by the fuel. Indirect injection engines also tend to produce lower amounts of particulate matter compared to direct injection engines as the fuel and air are more uniformly mixed.

Indirect injection using pre-combustion chambers are also used in high performance engines, such as those in Formula 1, where they can allow the engine to produce more power with greater efficiency.

==Diesel engines==

===Overview===
The purpose of the divided combustion chamber is to speed the combustion process, and to increase power output by increasing engine speed. The addition of a prechamber increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies engine (piston crown, head, valves, injector, prechamber, etc.) design and allows the use of less tightly toleranced designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the in-cylinder air flow is much more difficult than designing a prechamber. There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine. It is for this reason that car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical.

===Classification of indirect combustion chambers===

====Swirl chamber====

Swirl chambers are spherical cavities located in the cylinder head and separated from the engine cylinder by a tangential throat. About 50% of the air enters the swirl chamber during the compression stroke of the engine, producing a swirl.
After combustion, the products return through the same throat to the main cylinder at much higher velocity, so more heat is lost to the walls of the passage. This type of chamber finds application in engines in which fuel control and engine stability are more important than fuel economy. These are also called Ricardo chambers, named after the inventor, Sir Harry Ricardo.

====Precombustion chamber====
This chamber is located at the cylinder head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the main cylinder enters the precombustion chamber. At this moment, fuel is injected into the precombustion chamber and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the main cylinder, resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the main cylinder. This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the prechamber vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs.

====Air cell chamber====

The air cell is a small cylindrical chamber with a hole in one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to the piston crown, with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the air cell. The air cell is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At its top dead centre (TDC) the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and air cell.

When the injector fires, the jet of fuel enters the air cell and ignites. This results in a jet of flame shooting back out of the air cell directly into the jet of fuel still issuing from the injector. The heat and turbulence give excellent fuel vaporisation and mixing properties. Also, since the majority of the combustion takes place outside the air cell in the cavity, which communicates directly with the cylinder, there is less heat loss involved in transferring the burning charge into the cylinder.

Air cell injection can be considered as a compromise between indirect and direct injection, gaining some of the efficiency advantages of direct injection while retaining the simplicity and ease of development of indirect injection.

Air cell chambers are commonly named Lanova air chambers. The Lanova combustion system was developed by the Lanova company, which was founded in 1929 by Franz Lang, Gotthard Wielich and Albert Wielich.

In the US, the Lanova system was used by Mack Trucks. An example is the Mack-Lanova ED diesel engine fitted to the Mack NR truck.

===Advantages of indirect injection combustion chambers===
* Smaller diesels can be produced.
* The injection pressure required is low, so the injector is cheaper to produce.
* The injection direction is of less importance.
* Indirect injection is much simpler to design and manufacture, especially for gasoline engines. Less injector development is required and the injection pressures are low (1500 psi/100 bar versus 5000 psi/345 bar and higher for direct injection)
* The lower stresses that indirect injection imposes on internal components mean that it is possible to produce petrol and indirect injection diesel versions of the same basic engine. At best such types differed only in the cylinder head and the need to fit a distributor and spark plugs in the petrol version whilst fitting an injection pump and injectors to the diesel. Examples include the BMC A-Series and B-Series engines and the Land Rover 2.25/2.5-litre 4-cylinder types. Such designs allow petrol and diesel versions of the same vehicle to be built with minimal design changes between them.
* Higher engine speeds can be reached, since burning continues in the prechamber.
* Alternative fuels like bio-diesel and waste vegetable oil are less likely to damage the fuel system in an indirect-injection diesel engine, as high injection pressures are not needed. In direct-injection engines (especially modern engines using high-pressure common rail fuel systems), keeping fuel filters in good condition is more critical as debris can damage the pumps and injectors when waste vegetable oil or waste engine oil are used.

===Disadvantages===
* Fuel efficiency with diesel engines is lower than with direct injection as the larger exposed areas tend to dissipate more heat and the air moving through the ports tending to increase pressure drops. However, using higher compression ratios will somewhat negate this inefficiency.
* Glow plugs are needed for a cold engine start on diesel engines; many indirect injection diesel engines cannot start at all in cold weather without glow plugs.
* Because the heat and pressure of combustion is applied to a very small area on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging, supercharging, or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on one part of the piston crown causes uneven expansion which can lead to cracking, distortion, or other damage, although advancements in manufacturing techniques have allowed manufacturers to largely mitigate the effects of uneven expansion, allowing for indirect injection diesels to use turbocharging.
* Indirect engines are often much noisier than direct injection common-rail engines.
* Starting fluid (&quot;ether&quot;) often cannot be used in an indirect injection diesel engine as the glow plugs greatly increase the risk of preignition compared to direct injection diesels.

<text>César Fabián Delgado Godoy (born 18 August 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a winger. He also played as a central midfielder, making piercing forward runs through the center of the opposition&#x27;s defence. His nickname &quot;Chelito&quot; is derived from that of Marcelo Delgado (known as &quot;El Chelo&quot;) because of their same last name. Since 2013, he also holds Mexican citizenship.

==Club career==
Born in Rosario, Argentina, Delgado started his career at Rosario Central. He joined Cruz Azul for the 2003 Apertura, where he finished with 16 appearances and eight goals. Delgado made 21 appearances in the subsequent Apertura, again scoring eight goals. In the 2004 Apertura, Delgado scored another six goals in 15 games.

On 8 January 2008, Delgado moved to French club Lyon who paid a transfer fee of €11 million. He made his Ligue 1 debut on 20 January 2008 against RC Lens. Delgado came on as an 85th-minute substitute Lisandro López on 21 October 2009 against Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League and scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory. It was Lyon&#x27;s first win in the UEFA Champions League against English opposition.

On 10 June 2011, Delgado signed with C.F. Monterrey, and participated in the 2011 Mexican League Apertura, CONCACAF Champions League and Club World Cup tournaments.

==International career==
Delgado played for Argentina in the 2004 Copa América, scoring one goal, and was part of their gold medal-winning team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

He played several matches for the Argentina national team during 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, but due to injury he did not make the 23-man squad for the tournament.

<doc id="1167004" wikidata="Q431169" url="?curid=1167004" title="Mary Jane Lamond">
<text>Mary Jane Lamond (Scottish Gaelic: Màiri Sìne Nic Laomuinn, born 1960) is a Canadian Celtic folk musician who performs traditional Canadian Gaelic folk songs from Cape Breton Island. Her music combines traditional and contemporary material. Lamond is the vocalist on Ashley MacIsaac&#x27;s 1995 hit single &quot;Sleepy Maggie&quot;, and had a solo Top 40 hit with &quot;Horo Ghoid thu Nighean&quot;, the first single from her 1997 album &quot;Suas e!&quot;. Her 2012 collaboration with fiddler Wendy MacIsaac, &quot;Seinn,&quot; was named one of the top 10 folk and americana albums of 2012 by National Public Radio in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kingston, Ontario, the youngest of five children, Lamond moved a number of times during her childhood, to a series of cities and towns in Ontario and Quebec. Her parents were both originally from Nova Scotia, however, and she often visited her father&#x27;s parents in Cape Breton during her summer vacations. There she was first exposed to Celtic culture in general and to Scottish Gaelic music and the Scottish Gaelic language in particular. Lamond graduated from Westmount High School in Montreal, and then returned to Nova Scotia to enroll in the Celtic Studies program at St. Francis Xavier University, where she studied the school&#x27;s collection of 350 field recordings of traditional Scots-Gaelic songs. She graduated with a minor in Music at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

==Career==
While still a student, Lamond recorded an album of traditional material called &quot;Bho Thir Nan Craobh (From the Land of the Trees)&quot;, which she released independently in 1994. Among the musicians on the album was fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. MacIsaac had first seen Lamond perform in 1991 with a local band in Antigonish and was impressed with what he saw as her &quot;punk attitude,&quot; even as she was singing Gaelic songs. MacIsaac and Lamond collaborated again in 1995 on the song &quot;Sleepy Maggie&quot; for his album &quot;Hi™ How Are You Today?&quot;, which became a breakthrough recording for both of them.

Lamond followed this up with a solo album in 1997 called &quot;Suas e!&quot; (which in English means, roughly, &quot;Go for it!&quot;). The album was nominated for a Juno Award and an East Coast Music award. She released &quot;Làn Dùil&quot; in 1999, which cultural magazine PopMatters said &quot;should establish her as a major talent in Celtic and world music. &quot;Orain Ghàidhlig&quot;, most of which was recorded live in North River, Cape Breton Island, followed in 2001.

After 2000, Lamond mostly put her solo recording career aside for a variety of other projects, including composition for film and stage, and working with a variety of cultural agencies. Her most recent solo album to date is the 2005 recording &quot;Stòras&quot;, which means &quot;a treasure&quot; in English. Also in 2005, she contributed the song &quot;Mo Mhaeli Bheag Og&quot; to the charity album &quot;Voyces United for UNHCR&quot;.

She has been active in the ongoing preservation and revitalization of the Scottish Gaelic culture in Cape Breton as a member of the Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia and the Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council, and as a teacher of Gaelic language and song workshops.

In September 2012, Lamond and fiddler Wendy McIsaac released the album &quot;Seinn&quot;. &quot;Their guitar-and-fiddle matchup is beautifully balanced, behind butter-smooth vocals and timeless melodies,&quot; said a reviewer on NPR, which named the album as one of the year&#x27;s top 10 folk and Americana albums. In November 2013, &quot;Seinn&quot; won a Canadian Folk Music Award for traditional album of the year and a Music Nova Scotia award for traditional/roots recording of the year.

==Current work==
In September 2017, Lamond announced a new collaborative project, &quot;Patchwork&quot;, &quot;a project dedicated to the presentation of traditional song in a contemporary context.&quot; Patchwork consists of Lamond and her cousin, Laurel MacDonald, who perform Gaelic and English language songs. They perform a show entitled &quot;She Sings as She Flies: Revisiting the Helen Creighton Song Collection,&quot; and will be joined by Nicole LeBlanc, Kirsten Olivia, and Naomi Dawn Poulette singing songs from the Acadian, African Nova Scotian, and Mi&#x27;kmaq communities, respectively.

<text>Rear Admiral Charles Stewart Boggs (28 January 1811 – 22 April 1888) served in the United States Navy during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Boggs was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was appointed a midshipman in November 1826 and was assigned to the Boston Navy Yard until 1830, when he began two years at sea on board the brig &quot;Porpoise&quot;.

For the rest of the 1830s and the 1840s he had duties ashore and afloat, receiving his commission as Lieutenant in 1837, while serving in the ship of the line &quot;North Carolina&quot;.

He was an officer in the steamer &quot;Princeton&quot; during the Mexican–American War and executive officer of the frigate &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; in 1851.

Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1855, Boggs commanded two mail steamers during the next four years and was a lighthouse inspector at San Francisco, California in 1860–1861.

==Civil War service==
In December 1861 Boggs was given command of the gunboat . The following April, during the Capture of New Orleans, he commanded her with distinction:

In the attack of the squadron on the Mississippi forts, April 18–24 ... he destroyed six of the Confederate gunboats, but finally lost his own vessel, after driving his antagonist ashore in flames. When he found the &quot;Varuna&quot; sinking, he ran her ashore, tied her to the trees, and fought his guns until the water was over the guntracks.

&quot;Varuna&quot; was lost in the battle with 184 casualties. Receiving his Captain&#x27;s commission in July 1862, during the rest of the American Civil War he was commanding officer of the steam sloops &quot;Juniata&quot; and &quot;Sacramento&quot;, with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the steam cruiser &quot;Connecticut&quot; in the West Indies, and had special duty at the New York Navy Yard.

==Post-war service and last years==
In 1866–68 Boggs commanded the gunboat . As a commodore, he had another tour of lighthouse inspection service in 1869–1870, receiving promotion to rear admiral during this time.

His final seagoing service was as commander of the European Fleet in 1871. Retired in January 1872, he remained on duty as Secretary of the Light House Board until mid-1873.

Rear Admiral Charles S. Boggs died at New Brunswick, New Jersey, on 22 April 1888. He is buried in the churchyard of Christ Episcopal Church.

==Namesake==
The destroyer USS &quot;Boggs&quot; (DD-136) was named for him.

<text>The Early Ayn Rand: A Selection from Her Unpublished Fiction is an anthology of unpublished early fiction written by the philosopher Ayn Rand, first published in 1984, two years after her death. The selections include short stories, plays, and excerpts of material cut from her novels &quot;We the Living&quot; and &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.

==Publishing history==
Author Ayn Rand died in March 1982, after a long career that included four published novels, two Broadway plays, several produced screenplays, and numerous non-fiction essays and speeches. She left her literary estate, including her unpublished manuscripts, to her longtime friend and protégé Leonard Peikoff. Peikoff compiled a selection of her unpublished fiction into &quot;The Early Ayn Rand&quot;. Although many of the pieces included were never meant to be published, the collection shows Rand&#x27;s development as a writer. In the introduction, Peikoff writes he &quot;decided to publish this material because I believe that admirers of Miss Rand will be interested to learn by what steps she developed her literary abilities. They can now see the steps themselves.&quot;

This book is volume two of the &quot;Ayn Rand Library&quot; series edited by Peikoff. It was first published in a hardcover edition by New American Library in 1984. They published paperback edition in 1986. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2005.

==Contents==
The first edition begins with four unpublished short stories written in the 1920s. The next section starts with a synopsis of &quot;Red Pawn&quot;, a 1932 screenplay that was Rand&#x27;s first professional sale as a writer. This is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand&#x27;s first novel, &quot;We the Living&quot;, which was completed in 1934 and published in 1936. The section ends with a previously unpublished and unproduced play, &quot;Ideal&quot;, which was written in the mid-1930s. (&quot;Ideal&quot; was later produced in 1989 by Michael Paxton.)

The third section begins with &quot;Think Twice&quot;, a theatrical murder mystery written in 1939. Peikoff writes that in conversation about this play, Rand told him &quot;She could not ... write a series of mysteries, because everyone would know who the murderers were.&quot; It is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; - especially, the sections describing the relationship of the protagonist Howard Roark with actress Vesta Dunning, an episode of considerable importance in the original text and removed from the final version.

The revised edition adds two short stories. &quot;The Night King&quot; was a previously unpublished story written in around 1926. &quot;The Simplest Thing in the World&quot; was written in 1940 and previously published in a 1967 issue of &quot;The Objectivist&quot; and in Rand&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;The Romantic Manifesto&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon its initial publication in 1984, the book received only a few reviews, which were mostly positive. These included reviews in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. In a review for the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot;, literature professor Stephen D. Cox said the collection was &quot;very interesting&quot; and revealed details of Rand&#x27;s personality, although the writing in the selections was inferior to her previously published work.

Looking back on the book years later, Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein said reading it is &quot;a pleasurable experience&quot; that shows Rand&#x27;s &quot;nascent virtuosity&quot;. In her article about Rand for &quot;Contemporary Women Philosophers&quot;, Jenny Heyl said the selections show Rand&#x27;s &quot;strong flair for the dramatic&quot; and foreshadow themes from her later work.

<text>Steve Michael Cronin (born May 28, 1983) is an American retired soccer player who played as a goalkeeper.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Cronin was born in Sacramento, California. He played college soccer at Santa Clara University from 2001 to 2003. As a freshman, Cronin started 10 games as a goalkeeper and six in the field, finishing the season with a 0.79 goals against average. For the next two years, Cronin remained solely in goal, starting 27 matches and being named first-team All-West Coast Conference as a junior.

===Professional===
Following a tremendous performance with the Under-20 national team in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, Cronin signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. He was selected 10th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by his hometown San Jose Earthquakes. Unfortunately for Cronin, San Jose had two very competent goalkeepers in front of him, 2003 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Pat Onstad and Jon Conway, and the young keeper did not get any playing time in the 2004 season.

Cronin was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy in the 2005 off-season in a four-player deal and started several games for the Galaxy. He became the Galaxy&#x27;s starting goalkeeper after Joe Cannon was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes in January 2008. Cronin signed a multi-year contract extension with Galaxy after the 2008 MLS season, but transferred to Portland Timbers in February 2009.

Cronin joined Major League Soccer side D.C. United on 9 October 2009 on loan from Portland until the end of the 2009 MLS season. His first appearance for DC United was an October 17, 2009 start at home against the Columbus Crew. Cronin made 6 saves and earned a shutout win. Cronin enjoyed a strong season with Portland in 2010 appearing in 28 league matches, in which he posted a .79 goals against average which included 12 shutouts.

On October 19, 2010, Cronin was named as one of the first four players to be signed by the Portland Timbers ahead of their expansion into Major League Soccer in 2011, along with Bright Dike, Ryan Pore and Eddie Johnson.

On December 17, 2010, Cronin was traded from Portland along with allocation money to D.C. United for goalkeeper Troy Perkins. Cronin remained with D.C. through the 2011 season. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Cronin was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

===International===
As a teenager, Cronin trained with the Under-17 United States national team at the USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy, alongside players like Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Bobby Convey. He made his international debut with the team against Sweden on November 26, 1998.

He was called up for the United States national team camp before the game against Sweden on January 19, 2008, but was the only unused substitute in the match.

===Retirement===
On April 13, 2012, Cronin announced he was becoming a State Farm insurance agent. He opened his office in Denver, Colorado on March 1, 2013.

<text>The Selmer guitar — often called a Selmer-Maccaferri or just Maccaferri by English speakers, as early British advertising stressed the designer rather than manufacturer — is an unusual acoustic guitar best known as the favored instrument of Django Reinhardt. Selmer, a French manufacturer, produced the instrument from 1932 to about 1952.

==History==

In 1932 Selmer partnered with the Italian guitarist and luthier Mario Maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on Maccaferri&#x27;s unorthodox design. Although Maccaferri&#x27;s association with Selmer ended in 1934, the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952. The guitar was closely associated with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.

==Construction==
In its archetypal steel-string Jazz/Orchestre form, the Selmer is distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish s, either a D-shaped or longitudinal oval sound hole, and a cutaway in the upper right bout. The strings pass over a movable bridge and are gathered at the tail, as on a mandolin. Two &quot;moustache&quot; markers are fixed to the soundboard to help position the movable bridge. The top of the guitar is gently arched or domed — a feature achieved by bending a flat piece of wood rather than by the violin-style carving used in archtop guitars. The top is also rather thin, at about . It has a comparatively wide fretboard (about at the nut) and a snake-shaped, slotted headstock. The back and top are both ladder-braced, which was the norm for French and Italian steel-string guitars of the time (unlike American guitars, which frequently employed X-braced tops by this period).

Other models can be more conventional in appearance and construction, with the Modèle Classique, for example, essentially being a standard fan-braced, flat-top classical guitar.

==Early days: &quot;Maccaferri&quot; or D-hole guitar==

Early models have a large, D-shaped sound hole (the &quot;grande bouche&quot;, or &quot;big mouth&quot;), which was shaped specifically to accommodate an internal resonator invented by luthier Mario Maccaferri — this was designed to increase the volume of the guitar and to even out variations in volume and tone between different strings. The scale, at 640 mm, and fretting of the early guitars was very similar to other contemporary guitars (including the Gibson and Martin guitar designs from which most modern acoustic guitar patterns ultimately derive), but with a wide fretboard more typical of a classical guitar; they also had 12 frets clear of the body, although left hand higher fret access was facilitated by a (then novel) cutaway in the upper right bout. These guitars were made in several versions, including gut string (classical), steel string, seven string (Hawaiian) and four string (&quot;Grand&quot; and &quot;Ténor&quot;) versions, plus a special four string &quot;Eddie Freeman&quot; model (see below). Many of these guitars, produced during 1932 and 1933, were sold to the UK market via Selmer&#x27;s London showroom (which also distributed the guitar to regional dealers) and it was during this period that the guitars became known as &quot;Maccaferris&quot; to Britons.

==Post-Maccaferri or Oval-Hole guitar==

Maccaferri designed the original guitars and oversaw their manufacture, but his involvement with Selmer ended after 18 months. Over the next few years, the design evolved without his input (including some transitional models with round soundholes). By 1936, the definitive version of the Selmer guitar had appeared, with an oval hole in place of the large D-shaped hole, no internal resonator, and a neck with 14 frets clear of the body in place of the original 12. It was officially called the &quot;Modèle Jazz&quot;, but also known as the &quot;Petite Bouche&quot; (small mouth) or &quot;Oval Hole&quot;. These later guitars also have revised internal bracing and a longer scale length of . The vast bulk of guitars produced after the Maccaferri period were sold in Selmer&#x27;s native France; these later guitars are always referred to as &quot;Selmers&quot; (as are the earlier guitars by the French).

While Maccaferri may no longer have been around (and his resonator had been abandoned), the later guitars retain many unusual characteristics of his original innovative design, including the cutaway, the world&#x27;s first sealed oil-bath machine heads and a top that is bent, mandolin-style, behind the floating bridge — something that contributes to the guitar&#x27;s remarkable volume when played.

==Use==
Before the advent of amplification, the Selmer guitar appealed to European players the way archtop guitars did in America: it was loud enough to hear over other instruments in a band. The &quot;petite bouche&quot; model has an especially loud and cutting voice, and remains the design preferred by lead players in Django-style bands, while the accompanying rhythm players often use D-hole instruments. (This was the lineup in Django&#x27;s Quintette du Hot Club de France during its classic period in the late 1930s, and it remains the pattern for bands that emulate it.) Modern exponents of the style often amplify their instruments in concert, but may still play acoustically in small venues and jam sessions. Gypsy jazz players usually couple the guitar with light, silver-plated, copper-wound &quot;Argentine&quot; strings made by Savarez (or copies of these), and heavy plectrums, traditionally of tortoiseshell.

Today, the Selmer guitar is almost completely associated with Django Reinhardt and the &quot;gypsy jazz&quot; school of his followers. From the 1930s through to the 1950s, however, Selmers were used by all types of performer in France and (in the early days) in the UK. The first Selmers sold in the UK were used in standard dance bands, and were associated with performers such as Len Fillis and Al Bowlly.

In France, the Selmer was the top professional guitar for many years, and is heard in everything from musette to the backing of chansonniers. Leading players included Henri Crolla and Sacha Distel. More recently, the style of guitar (albeit a modification developed by Favino) has been associated with Enrico Macias.

==Other Selmer guitars==
Though best known for its steel-string D-hole and oval-hole guitars (known initially as the &quot;Orchestre&quot; and later the &quot;Jazz&quot; model), during the Maccaferri period Selmer also made and sold Maccaferri-designed classical guitars, harp guitars, 6- and 7-string Hawaiian guitars, tenor guitars, a 4-string &quot;Grande&quot; model and the &quot;Eddie Freeman Special&quot;, a 4-string guitar with the scale-length and body-size of a standard guitar, designed to use with a special reentrant tuning that was briefly successful in the UK market. Most of these instruments featured Macaferri&#x27;s distinctive D-shaped sound hole and cutaway design, and many contained the resonator. Production of all but the Modèle Jazz ended by the mid-1930s. Selmer also contracted the well-known American luthier John D&#x27;Angelico to construct a small number of archtop guitars to be sold under the Selmer brand for the U.S. market; this arrangement was short-lived and apparently only three instruments were constructed, of which a single one (from 1934) is known to survive.

== Copies, replicas, and similar guitars ==

Selmer did not make many guitars — fewer than 1,000 — and the company stopped all production by 1952. Playable original Selmers are rare and command high prices. One of the largest collections was owned by Louis Gallo (1907-1988), a close friend of Mario Maccaferri, who also possessed blueprints of these guitars and was the consultant for the Ibanez CSL copies. Before the current rise in interest in Django and his guitars, other European builders produced instruments that emulated the Selmer design with their own variations. These instruments began to appear in the 1930s with Busato, Di Mauro and—from the 1940s—Jacobacci, Favino, Anasatasio, the Gérôme Brothers, Olivieri, Rossi, Bucolo, Patenotte, Siro Burgassi, and a few others. In the 1970s, Selmer copies were produced in Japan for CSL and Ibanez, and in the 1980s for Saga Musical Instruments under the &quot;Saga&quot; brand. Meanwhile, a few French luthiers continued production. These include Jean-Pierre Favino and, more recently, Maurice Dupont.

Elsewhere, some high grade luthiers have offered Selmer-style guitars. These include Marco Roccia, Jerome Duffell, AJL (Ari-Jukka Luomaranta), John Le Voi, David Hodson, Rob Aylward, Chris Eccleshall, and Doug Kyle in the U.K., Michael Dunn, Shelley D. Park and Michael Whitney in Canada, Leo Eimers in the Netherlands, Risto Ivanovski in Macedonia and Rodrigo Shopis in New York City. More recently, inexpensive factory instruments from Asia have become available under the Gitane and Dell&#x27;Arte/John S. Kinnard brands.

Common departures from the original designs include omitting the internal resonator, adding a scratchplate, using solid (non-laminated) woods, and building D-hole models with a 14th fret neck-join rather than the original 12th fret join.

==Surviving original Selmers==
The number of surviving original Selmer guitars is not known exactly. Fewer than 200 are publicly known.

==Other Maccaferri guitars==
Prior to his association with Selmer, Maccaferri had acquired a reputation for building classical guitars with some of the features incorporated into his Selmer design including the cutaway, possibly the D-shaped sound hole, and in some cases, additional bass strings (harp guitars); photographs survive of Maccaferri himself performing on such instruments during the 1920s.

Following his severance from Selmer, in 1939 Maccaferri moved to the United States and became interested in plastic manufacturing. He produced plastic classical and steel-string guitars — of similar shape to his Selmer designs, albeit with F-holes — in the 1950s and 60s, along with many musical and non-musical plastic products. Produced first under his own name, and after 1964 under the name &quot;Mastro&quot;, the guitars were of short scale, but accurately fretted and intonated. These instruments were not a huge success at the time and are now considered oddities. However, the many variants of Maccaferri&#x27;s plastic ukulele enjoyed a considerable vogue in the 1950s and sold in large numbers.

Maccaferri also collaborated with Ibanez guitars in the late 1970s and early 1980s to produce 440 updated versions of his original D-hole design. They were individually signed by him and are considered quite playable and collectable.

<doc id="1167032" wikidata="Q56237" url="?curid=1167032" title="Tayap language">
<text>Tayap (also spelled Taiap; called Gapun in earlier literature, after the name of the village in which it is spoken) is an endangered Papuan language spoken by fewer than 50 people in Gapun village of Marienberg Rural LLG in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea (, located just to the south of the Sepik River mouth near the coast). It is being replaced by the national language and lingua franca Tok Pisin.

==History==
The first European to describe Tayap was , a German missionary-linguist, in 1937. Höltker spent three hours in the village and collected a word list of 125 words, which he published in 1938. He wrote that “it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘stumbles across’ Gapun, if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in this tiny village community, and also because of the inconvenient and arduous route leading to this linguistic island”.

Höltker&#x27;s list was all that was known about Tayap in literature until the early 1970s, when the Australian linguist Donald Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classifications of the many languages spoken there. Tayap and its speakers have been extensively studied by linguistic anthropologist Don Kulick since the mid-1980s. The language is described in detail in &quot;Tayap Grammar and Dictionary: The Life and Death of a Papuan Language&quot; and in &quot;A Death in the Rainforest: How a Language and a Way of Life Came to an End in Papua New Guinea&quot;.

Until World War II, when Japanese soldiers occupied the area and caused the villagers to flee into the rainforest, Gapun was located on a hill that several thousand years earlier had been an island in the sea that receded and formed the lower Sepik River. This indicates that Tayap may be the descendant of an ancient, autochthonous language that was already in place before the various waves of migration from the inland to the coast began occurring thousands of years ago. Foley (2018) also speculates that Tayap could have been part of a larger language family that was spoken on the island before the arrival of Lower Sepik speakers. As the coastline moved further northeast, Lower Sepik speakers migrated from the foothills into the new land areas created by the receding waters.

==Sociolinguistics==
Up to 2018, Gapun was the only village where Tayap is spoken, although some speakers of the language also lived in neighboring villages such as Wongan and Watam, having moved there because of marriage or as a result of conflicts over land or sorcery in Gapun. However, in 2018, Gapun village was burned down and abandoned due to violence among households. The former residents fled to the nearby villages of Wongan (), Watam (), and Boroi.

As a result of colonial activity, Gapun villagers subconsciously associate Tok Pisin with Christianity, modernity and masculinity, and they associate Tayap with paganism, &quot;backwardness&quot;, disruptive femininity and childish stubbornness. As a result, Tayap is being increasingly, but neither consciously nor deliberately, replaced by Tok Pisin, even though the villagers all express positive sentiments towards it and insist that they want their children to speak the language. Villagers express bewilderment towards the fact that their children no longer actively speak Tayap, and believe that they have, out of stubbornness, decided to reject Tayap entirely, and that they have chosen to speak Tok Pisin instead.

Unlike the neighboring patrilineal Lower Sepik-Ramu speakers, Tayap speakers are matrilineal. Tayap is typologically very different from the neighboring Lower Sepik-Ramu languages.

Tayap also has many loanwords from the Kopar and Adjora languages.

==Classification==
Tayap is not related to the neighboring Lower Sepik languages, though a relationship to the more distant Torricelli family has been proposed by Usher (2020).

In the 1970s Australian linguist Donald Laycock classified Tayap (which he called &quot;Gapun&quot;) as a sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum, on the basis of Georg Höltker&#x27;s 1938 word list and a few verb paradigms that Laycock gathered from two speakers.

Kulick and Terrill (2019) found no evidence that Tayap is related to the Lower Sepik languages, another branch of the erstwhile Sepik-Ramu phylum. They conclude that Tayap is a language isolate, though they do not compare it to other language families, as would be required to establish Tayap as an independent language family. Comparative vocabulary demonstrates the lexical aberrancy of Tayap as compared to the surrounding Lower Sepik languages: e.g. &quot;sene&quot; &#x27;two&#x27; (cf. proto-Lower Sepik *ri-pa-), &quot;neke&quot; &#x27;ear&#x27; (*kwand-), &quot;ŋgino&quot; &#x27;eye&#x27; (*tambri), &quot;tar&quot; &#x27;hear&#x27; (*and-), &quot;min&quot; &#x27;breast&#x27; (*nɨŋgay), &quot;nɨŋg&quot; &#x27;bone&#x27; (*sariŋamp), &quot;malɨt&quot; &#x27;tongue&#x27; (*minɨŋ), &quot;mayar&quot; &#x27;leaf&#x27; (*nɨmpramp) among the Holman &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) ranking of the Swadesh list. Cultural vocabulary such as &#x27;village&#x27;, &#x27;canoe&#x27;, &#x27;oar&#x27;, and &#x27;lime&#x27;, as well as the basic words &quot;awin&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; (cf. *arɨm) and &quot;a&quot; &#x27;eat&#x27; (cf. *am ~ *amb), may be shared with Lower Sepik languages. The word &quot;karep&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27; is shared specifically with Kopar (&quot;karep&quot;). However, most basic vocabulary items have no apparent cognates in surrounding languages.

==Phonology==


==Pronouns==
Tayap free pronouns in absolutive case, and object suffixes in the realis, are:


==Grammar==
Like many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively suppletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation class, both in terms of membership and formal marking.

Tayap distinguishes between realis and irrealis stems and suffixes. Verbal suffixes distinguish between Subject/Agent (S/A) and Object (O), which is marked by discontinuous morphemes in some conjugations. The ergative case (A) is marked by free pronouns and noun phrases, while the absolutive (S/O) does not have marked forms. As in many ergative Papuan languages, the ergative marker is not always included, as it is optional.

===Nouns===
Nouns generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual. These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full suppletion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the oblique noun phrase.

===Gender===
Like many languages of the Sepik-Ramu basin, Tayap has masculine and feminine genders.

There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal object suffixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns, even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. This type of gender-assignment system is typical of the Sepik region. Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural.

<text>Rear Admiral Augustus Henry Kilty (November 25, 1807 – November 10, 1879) was a United States Navy officer who served during the Civil War.

==Biography==
Born at Annapolis, Maryland, Kilty was appointed midshipman on July 4, 1821. He served in the frigate in the West India Squadron from 1827, then in the frigate in the Brazil Squadron from 1829. Kilty was promoted to passed midshipman on April 28, 1832, and served aboard the schooner in the West India Squadron in 1832–34.

He was commissioned as a lieutenant on September 6, 1837, and served on the sloop in the East India Squadron, taking part in Commodore George Reid&#x27;s operations in defense of American merchantmen at Quallah Batto in 1839. He then served on the frigates and in the Mediterranean Squadron between 1843 and 1848.

In 1850 he was stationed on the receiving ship at New York, and was at Baltimore a year later, returning to New York in 1855. Kilty was simultaneously promoted to commander on September 14, 1855, and placed on the Reserve List.

Kilty returned to the Active List on January 6, 1859, and was stationed in Baltimore in 1860 as a recruiting officer. From 1861 Kilty commanded the ironclad gunboat of the Mississippi Flotilla, and saw action at Island No. 10 and Fort Pillow. He commanded an expedition to White River, Arkansas, and during the operation, on June 17, 1862, was severely wounded, causing the loss of his left arm. Kilty received his commission as a captain on July 16, 1862, and spent the years 1863–64 on ordnance duty. He commanded the ironclad frigate in the North Atlantic Squadron from 1864 to 1865, and was promoted to commodore on July 25, 1866, and served as the Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard.

<text>Adrian Cann (born September 19, 1980) is a Canadian soccer player who plays as a defender for Canadian Soccer League club Serbian White Eagles FC.

==Club career==

===College===
Cann had a college soccer career at the University of Louisville from 2000 to 2003. Cann immediately earned a place in the Cardinals&#x27; starting lineup as a freshman, starting 20 games for the team, and was named to first-team All-Conference USA. Cann would maintain this level of performance, being named first-team All-C USA as a sophomore, junior, and senior, and being named the conference&#x27;s Co-Defensive Player of the Year as a junior and senior. In his final year he played 15 games for them.

Cann is a member of the University of Louisville Athletics Hall of Fame.

===Early career===
In 2002, he played with the York Region Shooters in the Canadian Professional Soccer League during the college offseason. He would make his debut on May 23, 2002, against the Mississauga Olympians.

Upon graduating, Cann was selected 16th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Colorado Rapids. Cann played little for the team, however, and was released midseason because of roster restrictions limiting a team&#x27;s international players. Cann then signed late in the season with Montreal Impact, but saw little playing time for the team, playing only 256 minutes over 7 games. He stayed with the Impact for the 2005 season and made 15 more appearances for them. Throughout his tenure with Montreal, he helped the club win the league championship in 2004 and the regular-season title in 2005.

In 2006, Cann signed with league rivals Vancouver Whitecaps. In his debut season, he assisted the club in winning their first USL First Division Championship by beating the Rochester Raging Rhinos 3–0. Vancouver would re-sign Cann the following season. After the conclusion of the season, he was named the club&#x27;s Most Outstanding Defender. He would return to Vancouver for his third and final season in 2008. In his final tenure with Vancouver he was appointed the team captain. Midway through the season, he was transferred to Esbjerg fB in Denmark&#x27;s premier league.

=== Europe ===
On June 29, 2008, he signed a four-year deal with Danish football side Esbjerg fB. He was released from his contract in early 2010.

Cann underwent a trial with League Two Burton Albion in England before agreeing to a trial with Toronto FC of Major League Soccer in March 2010.

=== MLS ===
Cann signed with Toronto FC on April 12, 2010, after ongoing trials with the team. He made his debut for the club against Philadelphia Union on April 15, 2010. Since joining fellow international Nana Attakora in the centre of defence the Canadian partnership has become one of the strongest in the league. On September 21, 2010, Cann had a stand-out performance which saw him win Man of the Match against highly rated Mexican side Cruz Azul in the 2010 CONCACAF Champions League Group Stage, the game finished as a 0–0 away draw. This game was also the first time in which Adrian had the honour of wearing the captain&#x27;s armband for Toronto since Dwayne De Rosario was on the bench. On November 18, Adrian was awarded the team&#x27;s most valuable player of the 2010 season, taking the honour from captain Dwayne De Rosario who won the award in the 2009 season.

Following pre-season camp in Turkey and Orlando, it was announced by the club on March 2, 2011, that Cann had not traveled with the team to Charleston, South Carolina for the Carolina Challenge Cup. This following Cann&#x27;s rejection of a new contract offer in which he wanted to continue to negotiate, all deals were removed from the table leading Cann to retire or wait for Toronto to cancel the remaining years on his current contract. However, eight days later the club announced that Cann had rejoined the team in Charleston just over a week before the first regular season game. After a strong early 2011 season from Cann, on May 31 he tore his ACL during a practice on a turf field with the team. Coach Aron Winter confirmed that he would miss the remainder of the 2011 league season.

Cann made his return from injury on April 14, 2012, against Chivas USA, the game ended in a 1–0 home loss for Toronto.

Cann was released by Toronto on November 15, 2012. He subsequently entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

=== NASL ===
On January 22, 2014, it was announced that Cann had signed with North American Soccer League club San Antonio Scorpions. He was named the league&#x27;s player of the week on November 3, 2014, after he recorded a goal that secured the fall season title for the club. San Antonio would claim the Soccer Bowl 2014 by defeating the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.

Cann was re-signed for the 2015 season and served as the team captain.

=== Canada ===
In the summer of 2016, he returned to the CSL circuit to sign with Scarborough SC. He made his debut on August 8, 2016, against Ukraine United. He recorded his first goal on October 9, 2016, in a 2–1 defeat to the Serbian White Eagles. Cann would help the eastern Toronto side secure a playoff berth by finishing third in the league&#x27;s first division. In the postseason, the club was eliminated in the opening round by Hamilton City. In the 2017 season, Scarborough qualified for the playoffs once again where they initially defeated Brantford Galaxy and later Vorkuta to reach the championship final. Scarborough would be defeated in the finals in a penalty shootout by the York Region Shooters Cann was named the team captain for the 2018 season. The eastern Toronto side managed to reach the championship final for the second consecutive year but was defeated by Vorkuta.

After a two-year absence, he returned to CSL for the 2021 season to play with the Serbian White Eagles. He re-signed with Serbia for the 2022 season. Throughout the 2022 campaign, he helped the Serbs in securing the regular-season title including a playoff berth. In the second round of the postseason, the Serbs were eliminated from the competition after a defeat to FC Continentals. Cann returned for the 2023 season. He would win more silverware with the Serbs in 2024 as they defeated his former team Scarborough for the Royal CSL Cup.

== Indoor career ==
In the winter of 2018–19, he transitioned into the indoor soccer format signing with the Mississauga MetroStars an expansion franchise that competed in the American-based Major Arena Soccer League. Cann along with teammate Dwayne De Rosario were named the team co-captains. He made his debut for the club on December 1, 2018, against the Baltimore Blast. In their debut season, the club failed to secure a playoff berth by finishing fourth in their division. In total, he appeared in 13 matches. The club would fold the following season.

== International ==
He made his debut for Canada in a January 2008 friendly match against Martinique. Cann was also chosen in the 23-man roster for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup where Canada won Group A with seven points before being knocked out by Honduras in the quarter-finals. His last cap came in 2011, earning him a total of nine caps, two of which were FIFA World Cup qualification matches.

Cann represented Canada at the 2017 CONCACAF Beach Soccer Championship. In 2022, he represented Canada Beach Soccer in the World Winners Cup, a non-FIFA beach soccer tournament.

== Post-playing career ==
After retiring he became a real estate agent. In 2020, he became involved with a group looking to found a professional soccer team in Peterborough, Ontario to play in League1 Ontario. The team became known as Electric City FC, with Cann hoping to serve as the team&#x27;s head coach after retiring.

<text>Robot locomotion is the collective name for the various methods that robots use to transport themselves from place to place.

Wheeled robots are typically quite energy efficient and simple to control. However, other forms of locomotion may be more appropriate for a number of reasons, for example traversing rough terrain, as well as moving and interacting in human environments. Furthermore, studying bipedal and insect-like robots may beneficially impact on biomechanics.

A major goal in this field is in developing capabilities for robots to autonomously decide how, when, and where to move. However, coordinating numerous robot joints for even simple matters, like negotiating stairs, is difficult. Autonomous robot locomotion is a major technological obstacle for many areas of robotics, such as humanoids (like Honda&#x27;s Asimo).

== Types of locomotion ==
=== Walking ===
* &quot;See&quot; Passive dynamics
* &quot;See&quot; Zero Moment Point
* &quot;See&quot; Leg mechanism
* &quot;See&quot; Hexapod (robotics)

 Walking robots simulate human or animal gait, as a replacement for wheeled motion. Legged motion makes it possible to negotiate uneven surfaces, steps, and other areas that would be difficult for a wheeled robot to reach, as well as causes less damage to environmental terrain as wheeled robots, which would erode it.

Hexapod robots are based on insect locomotion, most popularly the cockroach and stick insect, whose neurological and sensory output is less complex than other animals. Multiple legs allow several different gaits, even if a leg is damaged, making their movements more useful in robots transporting objects.

Examples of advanced running robots include ASIMO, BigDog, HUBO 2, RunBot, and Toyota Partner Robot.

===Rolling===
In terms of energy efficiency on hard, flat surfaces, wheeled robots are the most efficient. This is because an ideal, non-deformable rolling (but not slipping) wheel loses no energy. This is in contrast to legged robots which suffer an impact with the ground at heel strike and lose energy as a result.
For simplicity, most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.

Examples:
Boe-Bot,
Cosmobot,
Elmer,
Elsie,
Enon,
HERO,
IRobot Create,
iRobot&#x27;s Roomba,
Johns Hopkins Beast,
Land Walker,
Modulus robot,
Musa,
Omnibot,
PaPeRo,
Phobot,
Pocketdelta robot,
Push the Talking Trash Can,
RB5X,
Rovio,
Seropi,
Shakey the robot,
Sony Rolly,
Spykee,
TiLR,
Topo,
TR Araña, and
Wakamaru.

===Hopping===
Several robots, built in the 1980s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot, could stay upright simply by . The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself. Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults. A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot, run, pace, and bound.

Examples:
* The MIT cheetah cub is an electrically powered quadruped robot with passive compliant legs capable of self-stabilizing in large range of speeds. 
* The Tekken II is a small quadruped designed to walk on irregular terrains adaptively.

===Metachronal motion===
Coordinated, sequential mechanical action having the appearance of a traveling wave is called a metachronal rhythm or wave, and is employed in nature by ciliates for transport, and by worms and arthropods for locomotion.

===Slithering===
Several snake robots have been successfully developed. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings. The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot can even navigate both on land and in water.

Examples:
Snake-arm robot,
Roboboa, and
Snakebot.

===Swimming===
*&quot;See&quot; Autonomous underwater vehicles
===Flying===
*&quot;See&quot; Unmanned aerial vehicle

===Brachiating===

Brachiation allows robots to travel by swinging, using energy only to grab and release surfaces. This motion is similar to an ape swinging from tree to tree. The two types of brachiation can be compared to bipedal walking motions (continuous contact) or running (ricochetal). Continuous contact is when a hand/grasping mechanism is always attached to the surface being crossed; ricochetal employs a phase of aerial &quot;flight&quot; from one surface/limb to the next.

===Hybrid===
Robots can also be designed to perform locomotion in multiple modes. For example, the Reconfigurable Bipedal Snake Robot can both slither like a snake and walk like a biped robot.

== Biologically inspired locomotion ==
The desire to create robots with dynamic locomotive abilities has driven scientists to look to nature for solutions. Several robots capable of basic locomotion in a single mode have been invented but are found to lack several capabilities, hence limiting their functions and applications. Highly intelligent robots are needed in several areas such as search and rescue missions, battlefields, and landscape investigation. Thus robots of this nature need to be small, light, quick, and possess the ability to move in multiple locomotive modes. As it turns out, multiple animals have provided inspiration for the design of several robots. Some such animals are:

Pteromyini (flying squirrels)

Pteromyini (a tribe made up of flying squirrels) exhibit great mobility while on land by making use of their quadruped walking ability with high-degrees of freedom (DoF) legs. In air, flying squirrels glide through by utilizing lift forces from the membrane between their legs. They possess a highly flexible membrane that allows for unrestrained movement of the legs. They use their highly elastic membrane to glide while in air and demonstrate lithe movement on the ground. In addition, Pteromyini are able to exhibit multi-modal locomotion due to the membrane that connects the fore and hind legs which also enhances their gliding ability. It has been proven that a flexible membrane possesses a higher lift coefficient than rigid plates and delays the angle of attack at which stall occurs. The flying squirrel also possesses thick bundles on the edges of its membrane, wingtips and tail which helps to minimize fluctuations and unnecessary energy loss. 

Pteromyini are able to boost their gliding ability due to the numerous physical attributes they possess.

The flexible muscle structure serves multiple purposes. For one, the plagiopatagium, which serves as the primary generator of lift for the flying squirrel, is able to effectively function due to its thin and flexible muscles. The plagiopatagium is able to control tension on the membrane due to contraction and expansion. Tension control can ultimately help in energy savings due to minimized fluttering of the membrane. Once the squirrel lands, it contracts its membrane to ensure that the membrane does not sag when it is walking.

The propatagium and uropatagium serve to provide extra lift for Pteromyini. While the propatagium is situated between the head and forelimbs of the flying squirrel, the uropatagium is located at the tail and hind limbs and these serve to provide the flying squirrel with increased agility and drag for landing.

Additionally, the flying squirrel possesses thick rope-like muscle structures on the edges of its membrane to maintain the shape of the membranes. These muscular structures called platysma, tibiocarpalis, and semitendinosus, are located on the propatagium, plagiopatagium and uropatagium respectively. These thick muscle structures serve to guard against unnecessary fluttering due to strong wind pressures during gliding hence minimizing energy loss.

The wingtips are situated at the forelimb wrists and serve to form an airfoil which minimizes the effect of induced drag due to the formation of wingtip vortices. The wingtips dampen the effects of the vortices and obstruct the induced drag from affecting the whole wing. Flying squirrels are able to unfold and fold their wingtips while gliding by using their thumbs. This serves to prevent undesired sagging of the wingtips.

The tail of the flying squirrel allows for improved gliding abilities as it plays a critical role. As opposed to other vertebrates, Pteromyini possess a tail that is flattened to gain more aerodynamic surface as they glide. This also allows the flying squirrel to maintain pitch angle stability of its tail. This is particularly useful during landing as the flying squirrel is able to widen its pitch angle and induce more drag so as to decelerate and land safely.

Furthermore, the legs and tail of Pteromyini serve to control their gliding direction. Due to the flexibility of the membranes around the legs, the chord angle and dihedral angle between the membrane and coronal plane of the body is controlled. This allows the animal to create rolling, pitching, and yawing movements which in turn control the speed and direction of the gliding. During landing, the animal is able to rapidly reduce its speed by increasing drag and changing its pitch angle using its membranes and further increasing air resistance by loosening the tension between the membranes of its legs.

Desmodus Rotundus (vampire bat)

The common vampire bats are known to possess powerful modes of terrestrial locomotion, such as jumping, and aerial locomotion such as gliding. Several studies have demonstrated that the morphology of the bat enables it to easily and effectively alternate between both locomotive modes. The anatomy that aids in this is essentially built around the largest muscle in the body of the bat, &quot;pectoralis profundus&quot; (posterior division). Between the two modes of locomotion, there are three bones that are shared. These three main bones are integral parts of the arm structure, namely the humerus, ulna, and radius. Since there already exists a sharing of components for both modes, no additional muscles are needed when transitioning from jumping to gliding. 

A detailed study of the morphology of the shoulder of the bat shows that the bones of the arm are slightly sturdier and the ulna and the radius have been fused so as to accommodate heavy reaction forces from the ground

Schistocerca gregaria (desert locust)

The desert locust is known for its ability to jump and fly over long distances as well as crawl on land. A detailed study of the anatomy of this organism provides some detail about the mechanisms for locomotion. The hind legs of the locust are developed for jumping. They possess a semi-lunar process which consists of the large extensor tibiae muscle, small flexor tibiae muscle, and banana-shaped thickened cuticle. When the tibiae muscle flexes, the mechanical advantage of the muscles and the vertical thrust component of the leg extension are increased. These desert locusts utilize a catapult mechanism wherein the energy is first stored in the hind legs and then released to extend the legs.

In order for a perfect jump to occur, the locust must push its legs on the ground with a strong enough force so as to initiate a fast takeoff. The force must be adequate enough in order to attain a quick takeoff and decent jump height. The force must also be generated quickly. In order to effectively transition from the jumping mode to the flying mode, the insect must adjust the time during the wing opening to maximize the distance and height of the jump. When it is at the zenith of its jump, the flight mode becomes actuated.

== Multi-modal robot locomotion based on bio-inspiration ==
Modeling of a multi-modal walking and gliding robot after Pteromyini (flying squirrels)

Following the discovery of the requisite model to mimic, researchers sought to design a legged robot that was capable of achieving effective motion in aerial and terrestrial environments by the use of a flexible membrane. Thus, to achieve this goal, the following design considerations had to be taken into account:

1.       The shape and area of the membrane had to be consciously selected so that the intended aerodynamic capabilities of this membrane could be achieved. Additionally, the design of the membrane would affect the design of the legs since the membrane is attached to the legs.

2.       The membrane had to be flexible enough to allow for unrestricted movement of the legs during gliding and walking. However, the amount of flexibility had to be controlled due to the fact that excessive flexibility could lead to a significant loss of energy caused by the oscillations at regions of the membrane where strong pressure occur.

3.       The leg of the robot had to be designed to allow for appropriate torques for walking as well as gliding.

In order to incorporate these factors, close attention had to be paid to the characteristics of the flying squirrel. The aerodynamic features of the robot were modeled using dynamic modeling and simulation. By imitating the thick muscle bundles of the membrane of the flying squirrel, the designers were able to minimize the fluctuations and oscillations on the membrane edges of the robot, thus reducing needless energy loss. Furthermore, the amount of drag on the wing of the robot was reduced by the use of retractable wingtips thereby allowing for improved gliding abilities. Moreover, the leg of the robot was designed to incorporate sufficient torque after mimicking the anatomy of Pteryomini&#x27;s leg using virtual work analysis.

Following the design of the leg and membrane of the robot, its average gliding ratio (GR) was determined to be 1.88. The robot functioned effectively, walking in several gait patterns and crawling with its high DoF legs. The robot was also able to land safely. These performances demonstrated the gliding and walking capabilities of the robot and its multi-modal locomotion

Modeling of a multi-modal jumping and gliding robot after the Desmodus Rotundus (vampire bat)

The design of the robot called Multi-Mo Bat involved the establishment of four primary phases of operation: energy storage phase, jumping phase, coasting phase, and gliding phase. The energy storing phase essentially involves the reservation of energy for the jumping energy. This energy is stored in the main power springs. This process additionally creates a torque around the joint of the shoulders which in turn configures the legs for jumping. Once the stored energy is released, the jump phase can be initiated. When the jump phase is initiated and the robot takes off from the ground, it transitions to the coast phase which occurs until the acme is reached and it begins to descend. As the robot descends, drag helps to reduce the speed at which it descends as the wing is reconfigured due to increased drag on the bottom of the airfoils. At this stage, the robot glides down.

The anatomy of the arm of the vampire bat plays a key role in the design of the leg of the robot. In order to minimize the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), the two components of the arm are mirrored over the xz plane. This then creates the four-bar design of the leg structure of the robot which results in only two independent DoFs.

Modeling of a multi-modal jumping and flying robot after the Schistocerca gregaria (desert locust)

The robot designed was powered by a single DC motor which integrated the performances of jumping and flapping. It was designed as an incorporation of the inverted slider-crank mechanism for the construction of the legs, a dog-clutch system to serve as the mechanism for winching, and a rack-pinion mechanism used for the flapping-wing system. This design incorporated a very efficient energy storage and release mechanism and an integrated wing flapping mechanism.

A robot with features similar to the locust was developed. The primary feature of the robot&#x27;s design was a gear system powered by a single motor which allowed the robot to perform its jumping and flapping motions. Just like the motion of the locust, the motion of the robot is initiated by the flexing of the legs to the position of maximum energy storage after which the energy is released immediately to generate the force necessary to attain flight.

The robot was tested for performance and the results demonstrated that the robot was able to jump to an approximate height of 0.9m while weighing 23g and flapping its wings at a frequency of about 19 Hz. The robot tested without flapping wings performed less impressively, showing about 30% decrease in jumping performance as compared to the robot with the wings. These results are quite impressive as it is expected that the reverse be the case since the weight of the wings should have impacted the jumping.

<text>Pialligo (postcode: 2609) () is a rural suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The name &quot;Pialligo&quot; has been used for the area since at least 1820, and is probably of Aboriginal origin. It was also the name for the parish in the area. Streets in Pialligo are named with Aboriginal words.

Beltana Road in Pialligo is home to many of Canberra&#x27;s nurseries. Canberra Airport is located adjacent to Pialligo across Pialligo Avenue.

==Geology==

Quaternary alluvium covers the main western part of Pialligo. Calcareous shales from the Canberra Formation are deep underneath. The Woolshed Creek runs into the north end of Pialligo. This is a significant place, because in the bed of the creek the Rev W B Clarke first recognised Silurian fossils. These fossils were brachiopods, mostly &quot;Atrypa duntroonensis&quot;. He discovered them around 1844 century and it was the first time that Silurian rocks were identified in Australia, and at the time were the oldest known rocks in Australia. This mudstone is from the Canberra Formation.

==Living history==

Aside from the city&#x27;s design, arguably Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s longest-living legacy in Canberra is the forest of Redwood trees (both Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum) that was planted in 1918 by Walter Burley Griffin and arborist Thomas Charles Weston on Pialligo Avenue.

<doc id="1167046" wikidata="Q3737022" url="?curid=1167046" title="3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)">
<text>The 3rd United States Infantry Regiment is a regiment of the United States Army. It currently has three active battalions, and is readily identified by its nickname, The Old Guard, as well as Escort to the President. The regimental motto is &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot; (from Latin: &quot;Touch Me Not&quot;). The regiment is a major unit of the Military District of Washington (MDW). The 3rd Infantry is the oldest regiment still active in the Regular Army, having been first organized as the First American Regiment in 1784. It has been the official ceremonial unit of the U.S. Army since 1948. 

==Mission==
The regiment&#x27;s mission is to conduct memorial affairs to honor fallen comrades and ceremonies and special events to represent the U.S. Army, communicating its story to United States citizens and the world. Although The Old Guard primarily functions in a ceremonial role, it is an infantry unit and thus required to meet standards for certification in its combat role. The unit also trains for its support role to civil authorities in a wide range of scenarios and for deployments in support of overseas contingency operations. On order, it conducts defense in support of civil authorities in the National Capital Region and deploys elements in support of overseas contingency operations.

==Memorial affairs and ceremonial mission==
The 1st and 4th Battalions perform a variety of ceremonial and honorary duties. Memorial affairs missions include standard and full honors funerals in Arlington National Cemetery and dignified transfers at Dover Air Force Base. Old Guard soldiers also perform all dignified transfers of fallen soldiers returning to the United States.

The Old Guard&#x27;s ceremonial task list includes full honor arrivals for visiting dignitaries, wreath-laying ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and full honor reviews in support of senior army leaders and retiring soldiers. Special events include the Twilight Tattoo, a weekly performance in the adjacent Washington area on Wednesday evenings from May to July, and the Spirit of America, a historical pageant presented at three national venues in September. The Old Guard is the only unit in the U.S. Armed Forces authorized, by a 1922 decree of the War Department, to march with fixed bayonets in all parades. This was granted in honor of the 1847 bayonet charge by the regiment during the Battle of Cerro Gordo in the war with Mexico. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is protected round the clock by the 4th Battalion&#x27;s Tomb Guard Platoon, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

===Specialty units===
In addition to the marching platoons, there are also elements of The Old Guard that serve special roles unique both to the regiment as well as the U.S. Army. Among these include the sentinels of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, maintaining a twenty-four-hour watch over one of the nation&#x27;s most sacred sites; the Continental Color Guard, which presents the nation&#x27;s colors at special events across the Capitol Region; the Presidential Salute Battery, which renders honors to senior dignitaries at arrival and wreath ceremonies, reviews, and full honors funerals; and the US Army Caisson Platoon, which provides horses and riders to pull the caisson (the wagon that bears a casket) in military and state funerals.

The Caisson Platoon also provides the riderless horses used in full honors funerals and supports wounded warriors participating in the Therapeutic Riding Program. Other elements of The Old Guard include the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Guard (Company A), replicating the personal guard of General George Washington; wearing Colonial blue uniforms, powdered wigs, and cocked hats; and bearing Brown Bess muskets and halberds at ceremonies and special events; the US Army Drill Team, which demonstrates its skill and precision around the nation, and Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, which plays traditional arrangements of marching music, dating back to the time of the Continental Army. The Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps marches in Colonial style red-coated uniforms—to be &quot;better seen through the smoke of battle&quot;; the uniforms also include cocked hats and white powdered wigs. The drum major of the Fife and Drum Corps traditionally bears an espontoon (a historic pike-like weapon) in his right hand to direct and command his unit. As such, he is the only soldier in all the U.S. Armed Forces authorized to bear a spontoon and to salute with the left hand (although U.S. Navy personnel are allowed to salute with the left hand under certain conditions). Rounding out The Old Guard are the 289th Military Police Company, the 947th Military Working Dog Detachment, the 529th Regimental Support Company, two battalion headquarters companies, and the regimental headquarters company.

====Unique badges awarded to specific members of &quot;The Old Guard&quot;====
===Escort Platoon===
Escort Platoon is a term referring to a platoon of soldiers in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Regiment whose primary ceremonial mission is to march in ceremonies or military funerals. Generally, line infantry companies delegate the escort role to their 1st platoon. This platoon is generally composed of the tallest soldiers assigned to the unit. The regiment&#x27;s Presidential Escort Platoon, Honor Guard Company, is based at Fort Myer. The platoon serves at presidential funerals, inaugurations, Pentagon retirements, state dinners and state visits at the White House, and during presidential speeches in the Rose Garden, among other duties.

=== Uniforms and insignia ===
When on duty, members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment wear the standard dark blue Army Service Uniform and the infantry shoulder cord. Prior to its introduction in 2008, it was known as the Dress Blue Uniform and worn only by units that required their wear, such as the 3rd Infantry. The &#x27;blues&#x27; date back to the early 1950s, and were rarely worn by regular units, being an optional uniform along with the Dress Whites. Worn on the left shoulder is a black distinctive trimming, also known as a buff strap. On the shoulder of the Army Service Uniform, a blue tab with &quot;HONOR GUARD&quot; embroidered on it in white letters is worn. Nameplates are not worn for uniformity, and instead of ribbons, medals are worn instead. Pinned to the top right chest pocket is a badge unique to the Old Guard, bearing the shape of the Tomb and surrounded by laurels.

==Operational history==
===Early years===
The Old Guard traces its history to the First American Regiment organized in 1784 under command of Lieutenant Colonel Josiah Harmar, a veteran of the American Revolution. The 1st Infantry saw its first combat in an unsuccessful campaign against the Miami tribe near modern-day Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1790. This was followed by devastating losses at St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat in 1791.

In 1792 the United States Army was reorganized into the Legion of the United States, with the 1st Infantry forming the nucleus of the 1st Sub-Legion. (Sub-Legions were the remote ancestors of today&#x27;s Brigade Combat Teams, with organic Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery units.) On 20 August 1794, along with most of the Legion&#x27;s units under the command of Major General Anthony Wayne, the 1st Sub-Legion was engaged at the decisive victory of the Legion over the Miamis at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.

In 1795 the Legion was reorganized along more traditional lines and reverted to being called the United States Army. In the reorganization the 1st Sub-Legion was redesignated as the 1st Infantry Regiment.

As of 1805, six of the regiment&#x27;s ten companies were in St. Louis, Missouri, with the other four located at Fort Massac, Fort Dearborn, Fort Adams, Mississippi and Fort Wayne in Detroit.

===War of 1812 and reorganization of the Army===
During the War of 1812, the 1st Infantry served in Upper Canada and saw action at the battles of Chippewa and Lundy&#x27;s Lane. These actions give the regiment campaign credit for the War of 1812.

After the end of the War of 1812 in early 1815, the Army had a total of 44 Infantry regiments which were consolidated into only eight regiments. Rather than preserving the existing designations of the Army&#x27;s oldest units, it was decided instead to consolidate units based on their geographic proximity rather than seniority. On May 17, 1815, the 1st Infantry was consolidated with five other regiments to form the 3rd Infantry. This is why the 3rd Infantry is the oldest Infantry unit in the active United States Army rather than the 1st Infantry.

===1815 to 1861===
As of 30 November 1819, the regiment was located on the northwestern frontier at Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin. As of 9 November 1822, the regiment had 6 companies in Green Bay, two in Sarnac and two in Chicago.

The annual report of the Army from 1826 showed that the regiment had been re-located to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri.

As of November 1837, the regiment&#x27;s headquarters and six companies were at Fort Jesup in Louisiana with the other four companies at Fort Towson in Oklahoma.

From 1840 to 1843, the 3rd Infantry fought in the Seminole War in Florida.

During the Mexican War, the regiment fought in most of the major battles of the war including Palo Alto, Monterey, the invasion and Siege of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Churubusco and Chapultepec which led to the capture and occupation of Mexico City.

From 1856 to 1860, the regiment served in New Mexico where it fought the Navajo Indian tribe.

After serving in New Mexico, the regiment was spread out to various posts on the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Texas.

===American Civil War===
The 3rd Infantry saw extensive service during the United States Civil War and was credited with 12 campaigns. Detachments from the regiment were serving at Fort Pickens in Florida and in Saluria on the Gulf Coast of Texas when the war began in April 1861. Three companies of the 3rd Infantry surrendered on 25 April. Five of the regiment&#x27;s 10 companies were engaged at the Battle of Bull Run on 20 July 1861.

The regiment spent most of the war assigned to the Army of the Potomac and served mostly in Virginia. From May 1862 to March 1864, it served with 1st Brigade, 2nd Division of the 5th Corps. In March 1864, it was reassigned to the 4th Brigade, 1st Division of the 5th Corps. It participated in the Siege of Yorktown (part of the Peninsular Campaign), the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Cold Harbor and the Battle of Appomattox.

===1865 to 1917===
After the Civil War, the 3rd Infantry served in Kansas, Colorado and the Indian Territory (later the state of Oklahoma) from 1866 to 1874. It then served in Louisiana and Mississippi from 1874 to 1877, and Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota from 1877 to 1898.

During the Spanish–American War, the regiment served in Cuba from 14 June – 25 August 1898, where it participated in the Santiago Campaign and fought at the Battle of San Juan Hill.

After returning from Cuba, the 3rd Infantry was stationed at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. On 5 October 1898, a force of about 80 men—including soldiers of the 3rd Infantry, U.S. Marshals and Indian Police—fought in the Battle of Sugar Point against 17 members of the local Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians near the Leech Lake Reservation. The United States forces lost 6 soldiers and one Indian Police officer killed and another 14 wounded. There were no casualties among the Chippewa. Hospital Steward (later Major) Oscar Burkard received the Medal of Honor for rescuing casualties during the battle. The Battle of Sugar Point was the last battle fought between the United States Army and Native Americans.

The 3rd Infantry sailed from New York on 3 February 1899 aboard the US Army Transport &quot;Sherman&quot;. It reached Manila, The Philippines on 22 March 1899 via the Suez Canal. The regiment fought in the Philippine–American War until 15 April 1902. It then returned to the United States where it was stationed in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. It was then sent to Alaska where it served from 1 July 1904, to 6 August 1906, when it was sent to Washington state until it was sent back to the Philippines about 1909.

As of August 1914 the regiment&#x27;s headquarters, along with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, were located at Madison Barracks, New York. The 1st Battalion was located at Fort Ontario, New York.

===Mexican Border and World War I===
In 1916, the 3rd Infantry, then commanded by Colonel Julius Penn, was sent to the Texas-Mexico Border during the Pancho Villa Expedition and guarded against a possible invasion. One of the regiment&#x27;s officers at this time was 2nd Lieutenant James Van Fleet, who graduated West Point in 1915 and would rise to four-star general during the Korean War.

During World War I, the headquarters of the 3rd Infantry, along with the 3rd Battalion, was posted at Camp Eagle Pass in Texas. The 1st Battalion was located at Del Rio, Texas and the 2nd Battalion was at Fort Sam Houston. Throughout the war the regiment was assigned to patrolling the Mexican Border and did not see action.

During World War I, recent West Point graduate Captain Matthew Ridgway was assigned to the 3rd Infantry. Ridgway would go on to have a highly distinguished 38-year career including assignments as commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps, 8th United States Army, United Nations Command Korea, Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Chief of Staff of the United States Army.

===Interwar period (1919–39)===
Following the establishment of the United States Border Patrol, the 3rd Infantry was relocated to Camp Sherman in Ohio on 14 October 1920. The regiment marched 941 miles from Camp Sherman to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, arriving on 17 November 1921. Upon arrival the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were inactivated on 18 November 1921, and the 1st Battalion assumed garrison duties. The regiment was re-organized as a combat regiment when the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were re-activated on 8 June 1922.

On 24 March 1923, the regiment was assigned to the 7th Division. On 15 August 1927 the regiment was reassigned to the 6th Division.

On 1 October 1933, the regiment reverted to being assigned to the 7th Division. On 22 April 1939 the regiment conducted a review for Crown Prince Frederik and Princess Ingrid of Denmark.

===World War II===
During World War II, the 3rd Infantry served most of the war as a separate regiment and was not assigned to a combat division until 50 days before the German surrender.

On 16 October 1939, it was relieved from assignment to the 7th Division and assigned to the 6th Division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. In November 1940, the 1st Battalion was relocated to Fort Crook, Nebraska. The regiment was relieved from assignment to the 6th Division on 10 May 1941. The 3d Battalion departed from New York on 20 January 1941 and was sent to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland before moving to Fort Pepperrell in the Newfoundland Base Command in November 1941.

The 1st Battalion was inactivated 1 June 1941 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, with its soldiers being assigned to the 63rd Infantry and was re-activated 14 February 1942 in Newfoundland. The remainder of the regiment was sent to Camp Ripley, Minnesota, on 13 September 1941 and returned to Fort Snelling on 26 September.

When the United States declared war on Japan in December 1941, the regiment was stationed at Fort Snelling. The 2nd Battalion was inactivated 1 September 1942 at Fort Snelling.

The regiment arrived in Boston on 17 September 1943 and moved to Camp Butner, North Carolina, on 22 September 1943 where it was attached to the XII Corps. The 2nd Battalion was re-activated on 22 October 1943 at Camp Butner. The regiment was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, on 8 March 1944, where it provided cadre for the Infantry School.

Late in the war, the regiment staged at Camp Myles Standish, near Taunton, Massachusetts, on 27 February 1945, and departed from Boston bound for France on 8 March 1945.

The regiment arrived in Le Havre, France on 18 March 1945, and was attached to the reconstituted 106th Infantry Division with the mission of containing the isolated German garrison at St. Nazaire. The regiment moved with the 106th Division into Germany on 26 April 1945 — twelve days before the surrender of Germany — and processed prisoners of war. The regiment was then assigned to duty in the occupation of Germany and was located at Babenhausen. The 3d Infantry was inactivated on 20 November 1946 in Berlin.

The 3d Infantry was credited with the American Theater streamer for its defense of Newfoundland. It was also credited with the European Theater Northern France Campaign streamer, even though the Northern France Campaign technically ended on 14 September 1944. However theater commanders were authorized to award Campaign Participation Credit to select campaigns even after the technical end of that campaign, the Northern France Campaign being one of those, since the 3rd Infantry Regiment assisted with the mission of containing the German Garrison at St. Nazaire.

===Post World War II===

The 3d Infantry Regiment (less the 2nd Battalion) was re-activated on 6 April 1948 at Fort Myer, Virginia. The 2nd Battalion was concurrently re-activated at Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C. This was when the unit assumed the role it is best known for today as the official ceremonial unit of the United States Army. The regiment&#x27;s reactivation was shortly before the state funeral of General of the Armies John J. Pershing held on 19 July 1948 in which soldiers of the 3d Infantry played a prominent role. This was the beginning of the 3d Infantry&#x27;s current mission of performing ceremonial duties in the Washington, D.C. area.

The Old Guard gained national attention for the support it provided to the state funeral of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. Aside from the Kennedy funeral, the Old Guard has also supported state funerals for the Unknown Soldiers of World War II, Korea and Vietnam as well as presidents Herbert Hoover, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. Other persons who have received state funerals the Old Guard has supported included General John J. Pershing, General Douglas MacArthur, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Medal of Honor recipient Senator Daniel Inouye.

Aside from supporting military and state funerals, the 3d Infantry also assumed the responsibility for providing the guard detail at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and for providing honor guards at the White House for high ranking dignitaries.

===Subordinate battalions===
The 3d Battalion of the 3d Infantry, from 1963 until its inactivation in 1994, was one of the three light infantry battalions that made up the Army Reserve&#x27;s 205th Infantry Brigade (Light) (Separate), which in turn was the round-out brigade for the Regular Army&#x27;s 6th Infantry Division (Light), based at Fort Richardson and Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The 205th Infantry Brigade was headquartered at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, until its inactivation. It was inactivated on 25 August 1994. The 3d Battalion was scheduled to activate at Fort Carson as part of the 5th IBCT/4th Infantry Division. The activation was cancelled when the army froze at 45 brigades.

The 5th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 21 July 1969 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The 6th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 1 February 1969 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The 7th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 25 July, concurrent with the inactivation of the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

===The 2nd Battalion in Vietnam (1966-1970)===
On 1 June 1966, the 2nd Battalion was activated at Fort Benning, Georgia and assigned to the 199th Light Infantry Brigade (199th LIB). The 199th LIB deployed to South Vietnam in December 1966 operating throughout III Corps.

On 3 July 1969 while Company D, 2nd Battalion was patrolling in Long Khanh Province during Operation Toan Thang III it was ambushed by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam 33rd Regiment losing nine killed including Corporal Michael Fleming Folland who smothered an enemy hand grenade with his body, he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

The 199th LIB returned to the United States in 1970 and the 2nd Battalion was inactivated on 15 October 1970 at Fort Benning.

===The 4th Battalion in Vietnam (1967–68)===
The 4th Battalion of The Old Guard was officially activated at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, on 1 July 1966, and commanded by LTC Harold J. Meyer. The battalion consisted initially of Headquarters and Headquarters Company and A Company, containing one officer/five enlisted men and twenty one enlisted men respectively. By 31 December 1966, the battalion strength had increased to 37 officers, two warrant officers and 492 enlisted men.

When the battalion was reactivated, it utilized facilities formerly occupied by elements of the 25th infantry Division. During the period of 1 July 1966 through 10 September 1966, the battalion conducted preparation for Basic Unit Training since most of the Old Guard&#x27;s lower enlisted personnel had never served with a regular unit. The non-commissioned officers, on the other hand, were greatly experienced with many recent returns from Vietnam.

During its preparation for service in South Vietnam, the 4th Battalion was assigned to the 11th Infantry Brigade. On 15 August 1967, the 11th Infantry Brigade adopted the &quot;light Infantry&quot; concept. By selecting one rifle platoon and personnel from the weapons platoon from each line company, an additional line company, delta, was introduced to the battalion. Further by removing the 4.2&quot; mortar and reconnaissance platoons and the ground surveillance section from the former headquarters company, a combat support company, Echo, was created with these two changes to the battalion, the revised strength authorization totaled 44 officers, 1 warrant officer and 886 enlisted men.

On 7 July 1967, the battalion conducted a farewell review for its departing commander, Lieutenant Colonel Meyer and simultaneously Major C. Hartsfield assumed interim command of the battalion. On 20 July, the battalion welcomed Lieutenant Colonel Alvin E. Adkins as its new commander. Adkins had previously served in World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

On 25 December, personnel of the advance party, including LTC Adkins, the company commanders and additional key staff members departed by aircraft for South Vietnam. Shortly thereafter at 23:30 on 5 December the main body left Honolulu pier 40 on the . After 14 days at sea, the main body arrived at Qui Nhon harbor and proceeded by vehicle convoy north along Highway 1 to Đức Phổ Base Camp and a base of operations known as Carentan. In-country training and combat operations commenced immediately, throughout the remainder of 1967 the battalion conducted search and destroy missions outside Carentan and to the west of Đức Phổ.

On 16 March, Company B was landed by helicopters near Mỹ Khê, Quảng Ngãi Province and participated in the killing of between 347 and 504 civilians in the My Lai Massacre.

===Global War on Terrorism===
On 12 November 2003, the 2nd Battalion deployed to Iraq with the 3d Brigade (Stryker), 2nd Infantry Division to begin a tour of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This was the first deployment of an element of The Old Guard since the Vietnam War. Operating first in the dangerous Sunni Triangle area under command of the 4th Infantry Division, the soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry relieved troops of the 101st Airborne Division in January 2004 in northern Iraq. The 2nd Battalion began redeployment back to the United States in October 2004.

Another historic event occurred on 15 December 2003, when Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion deployed from Fort Myer, Virginia, for duty in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. This was the first deployment of an element of The Old Guard&#x27;s 1st Battalion since World War II. Bravo Company, also called Task Force Bravo and Team Battlehard, arrived in the US Central Command area of operations to take up duty in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa on 17 December 2003. The soldiers of The Old Guard served in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Based at Camp Lemonnier, their missions in the region included force protection to civil affairs and engineer personnel, engaging in joint operations with other U.S. and regional military forces and constant training to stay prepared. Team Battlehard redeployed back to Fort Myer in July 2004.

In 2007, 1st Battalion&#x27;s Delta Company was deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti as part of CJTF-HOA, supporting humanitarian missions and local military training in the region.

Charlie Company, 1st Battalion deployed to Camp Taji, Iraq, in 2009 to execute its theater internment support mission.

In December 2011, 2nd Battalion deployed to Kandahar Province in Afghanistan, where they were responsible for providing base security for U.S. Army Special Forces and U.S. Navy SEALs who were engaged in village stability operations.

===Current duties===
The Old Guard&#x27;s current duties include, but are not limited to, providing funeral details at Arlington National Cemetery, guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, providing honor guards for visiting dignitaries, supporting official ceremonies and providing a quick reaction force for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

As of 2018, there were three active battalions of the 3d Infantry Regiment.

&quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; is a 1987 American drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel of the same title by Nicholas Proffitt. It stars James Caan, Anjelica Huston, James Earl Jones, Mary Stuart Masterson and D. B. Sweeney. The movie, set in 1968 and 1969, attempts to examine the meaning of the Vietnam War entirely through the eyes of the members of &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, the stateside-based elite Army unit whose duties include Presidential escorts and military funerals at Arlington.

<text>Area code 585 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for the city of Rochester and eight surrounding counties in Western New York state. The area code was activated on November 15, 2001, when the numbering plan area of area code 716 was reduced in geographic reach in an area code split. Previously, Rochester had shared 716 with Buffalo. Aside from new area codes created in the New York City metropolitan area and Long Island, 585 was the second new area code in the state since 1954, having been preceded by 845 in 2000.

The border between 716 and 585 roughly matches county lines. Therefore, some ZIP codes have telephone numbers in two area codes. A significant part of Ontario County uses area codes 315 and 680. Part of the town of Farmington is north of the NY Thruway (Interstate 90), and is &quot;joined&quot; with Wayne County in the 315/680 area code.

, the area code is not expected to require relief until around 2029.

<doc id="1167055" wikidata="Q1581540" url="?curid=1167055" title="Toyota Tacoma">
<text>The Toyota Tacoma is a pickup truck manufactured by Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota since 1995. The first-generation Tacoma (model years 1995 through 2004) was classified as a compact pickup; subsequent models are classified as mid-sized pickups. The Tacoma was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Truck of the Year for 2005.

As of 2015, the Tacoma was sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Bermuda, and the French overseas collectivity of New Caledonia. Most markets across the world receive the Toyota Hilux in lieu of the Tacoma.

The name &quot;Tacoma&quot; was derived from the Coast Salish peoples&#x27; name for Mount Rainier in the U.S. state of Washington.


== First generation (N140/N150/N160/N170/N190; 1995) ==


The Tacoma was introduced in the US in February 1995 (with a market launch in March 1995) as a replacement for the Toyota Pickup (which was the name used for the Hilux in the North American market). When comparing with the Hilux, the Tacoma receives engineering with greater priority on ride quality, handling, comfort, and safety over ruggedness and payload capacity. The design intends to better suit the needs of the US and Canadian market, where pickup trucks are used as personal vehicles rather than for commercial, agricultural, and off-road purposes.

=== Development ===
Development began in 1989, following the launch of the fifth-generation Toyota Pickup in late 1988 and concluded in 1994. Design work was done at Calty Design Research in California from 1990 to 1992, when Kevin Hunter&#x27;s exterior design proposal was chosen in the autumn of 1991 and in final form, frozen for production in 1992. Patents for the production design were filed in Japan in April 1993 and October 28, 1993, in the United States.

=== Technical ===
Three engines were available for the Tacoma:

;Notes:


Two-wheel drive (2WD) Tacomas (excluding PreRunner models) had five-stud wheel-lug patterns and either the 2.4- or 3.4-liter engine. Four-wheel drive (4WD) and PreRunner Tacomas had six-stud wheel-lug patterns and were available with either the 2.7-L or 3.4-L engine. Initially, the 2.4 L was limited to the 2WD models (both regular and Xtracab), while the 2.7-liter the standard engine for 4WD models, and the 3.4-liter V6, shared with the larger T100 truck, was an option for the 2WD (Xtracab only) and 4WD (regular and Xtracab). The top-of-the-line SR5 trim was available for the 4WD Xtracab V6. From 1997 on, the 3.4 L V6 was dropped as an option for the regular cab models, which were available only with a 2.4-L or a 2.7-L four-cylinder engine.

An aftermarket Toyota Racing Development (TRD) supercharger kit was available for the 3.4-liter V6, raising output to and . The V6 supercharger kit was specified for model years 1997 and later, as the earlier engine control units (ECUs) had limitations. A kit to add a 7th fuel injector was available, including a replacement ECU, boosting performance further to and . In addition, TRD supercharger kits were available for the 4-cylinder engines (2.4 L and 2.7 L) as well.

A five-speed manual transmission was standard for all models initially, with a four-speed automatic transmission available as an option except for the 4WD V6 regular cab. The PreRunner (MY98–04) and Double Cab (01–04) models were available only with an automatic transmission for the first generation. The 3.4 L V6 was paired with the R150F manual transmission or the A340F (4WD) or A340E (2WD) Aisin automatic transmission; the A340F code is 30-40LE.

The first-generation Tacoma has a fully-boxed frame (meaning the main frame rails have a closed rectangular cross-section) until immediately after the rear leaf spring mounting bracket, where the frame transitions into a C-shaped cross-section. The TRD Off-Road package was introduced in 1998. This package added a locking rear differential and was only available to PreRunner and four-wheel drive models that were equipped with the 3.4-L V6. Antilock brakes were made standard across the Tacoma line for the 2003 model year.

=== Updates ===
The first-generation Tacoma underwent its first minor update in October 1996, switching from recessed sealed beam headlamps to a flush design on 2WD models. There were two more cosmetic facelifts: the first in July 1997 and the second in October 2000. The most visible changes were in the modified front grilles (both facelifts, for model years 1998 and 2001) and tailgate badging and emblems (first facelift, MY1998). The MY1998 facelift included distinct grilles for the 2WD and 4WD models; 2WD models featured a prominent horizontal bar splitting the grille. A StepSide bed was added as an option for MY2000.

=== Variants ===
At its introduction as a model year 1995, Tacoma 4WD and 2WD models could be distinguished externally by the front grilles. The 4WD model had two heavy chrome bars flanking a trapezoidal opening, tapering toward the top, while the 2WD model had thinner bars (optionally chrome) with a trapezoidal shape tapering toward the bottom. Both the regular cab and extended Xtracab share the same bed, which has an interior length of ; the wheelbase and overall length of the Xtracab is extended by approximately compared to the regular cab.

The PreRunner model was introduced for the 1998 model year. The PreRunner is a 2WD that shares the same taller suspension, six-lug wheel bolt pattern, and 2.7 L base engine as the four-wheel drive. Along with the four-wheel drive model, it was also available with the TRD Off-Road Package that included a locking rear differential, also introduced in 1998. A Regular Cab PreRunner was introduced in 1999.

Designed through 1998 (by Yusuke Fukushima) as part of the MY2001 facelift (patented on September 22, 1998, at Japan Patent Office under #0890798) was a new crew cab (four-door) model added to the lineup in October 2000. The crew cab, officially dubbed as the Double Cab model, featured four doors and Tokico gas shocks, while the extended cabs still opened with two doors and used Bilstein shocks. The extended cab featured a bed, while the crew cab featured a bed. Many customers were upset with small crew cab beds, but most competitors shared this shortcoming.

In October 2000, along with the front facelift, Toyota also unveiled the S-Runner trim package for the 2WD Xtracab that was available exclusively with the 3.4-liter V6 engine coupled to a five-speed manual transmission. The final drive ratio is 3.15:1. Visually, the S-Runner carried a monochrome finish, with a grille and other trim pieces colored to match the exterior in either Black Sand Pearl or Radiant Red. The overall height is reduced by approximately through the use of low-profile P235/55R16 tires on alloy wheels; additional suspension tuning features include Tokico gas shocks and front and rear anti-sway bars. Only 800 were produced each month from September 2000 to August 2004.

=== Sales and recalls ===

In 2008, Toyota proactively announced a 15-year, unlimited-mileage corrosion warranty for 1995–2000 model years due to inadequate rustproofing and frame corrosion issues affecting over 800,000 Tacomas. Toyota will either repair the frame or buy back the truck for 1.5 times its KBB retail value. This was later extended to include 2001–2004 model years, but in these cases when a frame was found to be rusty to the point of perforation, the frame is replaced with a new one instead of a buy back. It is suspected that inadequate drainage in the fully-boxed frame may have trapped moisture, leading to corrosion. The second-generation Tacoma moved to a frame with open C-section rails instead.

On November 21, 2012, Toyota recalled about 150,000 Tacoma midsize pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 that were sold primarily in 20 cold-weather U.S. states. The recall involves the spare tire and how it could fall off.

== Second generation (N220/N240/N250/N260/N270; 2004) ==

In 2000, Toyota began development of the second generation Tacoma under chief engineer Chikuo Kubota. The majority of development work was handled by Hino in Japan. Designers Shigeya Hattori and Hideo Karikomi of Hino won the internal design competition in 2001. Final designs were frozen for production in 2002 and patents filed on July 3, 2003, with test mules being tested from early 2003. Prototypes were built later in 2003, with development ending in the second quarter of 2004.

On February 4, 2004, at the Chicago Auto Show, Toyota unveiled a bigger and more powerful Tacoma. Launched on October 18, 2004, as a 2005 model, this new Tacoma was available in eighteen different combinations of three cab configurations, four transmissions, two engines, and two bed lengths.

=== Updates ===
The 2006 model Tacoma had only minor changes from the 2005 model, with some options now standard. Toyota added two new interior colors for the 2007 model year; 2008 models carried over.

A minor facelift came for 2009, including a slightly revised grille on some models, new LED taillamps, and on the X-Runner, TRD off-road and TRD Sport models includes a smoked headlamp trim. Auxiliary audio input now comes standard. The Access/Double Cab trucks have two new ceiling mounted speakers and an available backup monitor. Four new exterior colors are also added to the Tacoma. Safety features were added, and the mechanical limited-slip differential was no longer available. TRD off-road models continue to come equipped with a locking rear differential.

The 2012 model year refresh featured a restyled front bumper, headlights, grille, hood, new interior and a shark fin antenna for the SiriusXM satellite radio. The 2013 model year comes with a touch screen audio system and removes the shark fin antenna and SiriusXM radio capability unless the optional Entune package is installed. 2014 models came with a new SR trim and for 2015 models the regular cab model was discontinued.

In November 2016, Toyota USA settled a class action suit over frame rust, agreeing to inspect and if necessary replace rusted frames on 2005–2010 model year Tacomas, 2007–2008 MY Tundras, and 2005–2008 MY Sequoias in the US and its territories.

=== Technical ===
The three cab configurations consist of regular cab, access cab, and double cab. The transmissions come in 4-speed automatic, 5-speed automatic, 5-speed manual, and 6-speed manual. The Double Cab model is available with either the short bed, , or the long bed, ; other models exclusively use the long bed.

The Tacoma&#x27;s 4.0-liter &quot;1GR-FE&quot; V6 took the place of the original 3.4-liter &quot;5VZ-FE&quot; V6. The new V6 had many enhancements, such as a tow rating of , and a payload capacity of . The smaller, but all-new 2.7-liter &quot;2TR-FE&quot; four-cylinder alternative in less expensive models is not as powerful, but also consumes fuel at a lower rate.

;Notes
=== Models and trims ===
Toyota also introduced an X-Runner trim, which replaces the slow selling S-Runner trim from the previous generation. The X-Runner features the &quot;1GR-FE&quot; paired to a six-speed manual transmission, alloy wheels, is lowered two inches from the factory and included an X-Brace suspension package.

Toyota also included a Down-Hill Assist Control (DAC) and Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC), with models that were equipped with the optional TRD Off-Road package. DAC automatically applies braking during downhill descents while HAC prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards on hills. A rear locking differential, or limited-slip differential were also some optional features.

Every Tacoma was manufactured with a composite inner bed that includes a deck rail system with four tie down cleats, hook-pins, and storage boxes. TRD package equipped Tacomas also feature an in-bed 115 V/400 W AC power outlet. The tie down cleats are rated to hold up to .

==== TRD packages ====
The Tacoma is offered in two TRD packages: Sport and Off-Road. The Sport is targeted more towards improved on-road performance, while the Off-Road is more geared towards the off-road enthusiast. Both are available in 2WD or 4WD, with rear electronic locking differential available only in the Off-Road model. Both variants come with TRD-specific seats, and 400-w AC power inverters mounted in the bed. A TRD supercharger for the 1GR-FE was a dealer-installed option. TRD offered a cold-air intake and cat-back exhaust system through Toyota dealerships. Also available are TRD cosmetic accessories such as aluminum front skid plate, along with shift knobs (A/T and M/T), radiator cap, oil filler cap, and exhaust tip. TRD also sold seat covers for these Tacomas, but only fit the 2005–08 models (09-15 have airbags in the seats, 2005–08 do not).

The TRD Sport package sells in two levels. The first level has a color-matched grille, color-matched front/rear bumpers/door handles/mirrors, and hood with nonfunctional scoop, Bilstein shocks/struts, stainless steel exhaust tip, and aluminum 17-in wheels with 265/65R17 tires. The second level includes the above and adds a towing package (oil and transmission coolers, fan clutch) and heavy-duty high output alternator and battery. The 2005–08 model years came with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The 2009–15 model years have an open differential with a brake-assisted &quot;automatic limited slip&quot; rear differential, similar to a VSC system.

The basic TRD Off-Road package includes none of the color-matched body parts (black door handles/mirrors, chrome bumper/grille). Different from the off-road package, the Technology Package has color-matched body parts, aluminum 16-in wheels, Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and electronic locking rear differential but does not include the hood scoop from the Sport models. The off-road package included certain features that are useful for off-roading, such as those mentioned earlier, while the Technology Package features include A-TRAC (2009–15), Hill Descent assist (automatic transmission only) and Hill Start assist (manual transmission only). Progressive-rate springs are included, and smaller-diameter sway bars compared to the Sport package, which gives the Off-Road more wheel articulation and a smoother ride, but allows for more body roll. The towing package upgrades the battery, alternator, and fan clutch, and includes oil/transmission coolers (same as the Sport). All-terrain tires (265/70R16) and a heavy duty front tow hook complete the package.

===== TRD Extreme and T/X Baja =====
From model years 2011 to 2014, the Tacoma was offered in 1500 units of the T/X Baja package. The package includes upgraded lifted suspension with Eibach springs and TRD Bilstein coil-overs at the front and TRD Bilstein reservoir shocks at the rear with an additional leaf spring. The bead-lock style wheels were wrapped in BF Goodrich All-terrain tires. The Baja model also includes a stainless steel TRD exhaust. The iconic Baja shift knob is also available for the six-speed manual transmission models.

===== TRD Pro =====

The TRD Pro package was offered for 2015 models. Based on the TRD Off Road, the Pro package added a 2&quot; front lift with Bilstein 2.5-inch front shocks and 2.0-inch rear shocks with remote reservoirs for extra wheel travel, BFGoodrich all-terrain tires on 16-inch black and silver bead-lock-style wheels, and TRD cat-back exhaust system. Cosmetic upgrades included the scooped Sport hood, black badges, blackout lighting elements, a TRD Pro matte-black grille with TOYOTA lettering, and various TRD-badged interior parts. About 1200 TRD Pro Tacomas were made.

===== Ironman edition =====
In 2008, an &quot;Ironman&quot; edition was released, named after Ivan &quot;Ironman&quot; Stewart. The engine output was increased to and with the addition of the TRD Supercharger and Magnaflow exhaust.

==== X-Runner ====
The Toyota X-Runner was a limited production sport model. Although it utilizes the standard 4.0L and 6-speed manual from other Tacomas, the X-runner uses lowered double-wishbone suspension, Bilstein shocks and frame x-bracing.

The X-Runner is only available in three colors per year, and only five colors total. For the 2005 to 2008 model years, the X-Runner was available in Speedway Blue, Radiant Red and Black Sand Pearl. 2009 exchanged Radiant Red for Barcelona Red Metallic and Black Sand Pearl for Black. For the 2012 model year facelift, Speedway Blue became Nautical Blue Metallic and then Blue Ribbon Metallic for 2014/2015. The X-Runner was discontinued in the mainland US after the 2013 model year. The X-Runner was last offered in Canada for the 2014 model year and in Hawaii (USA) for the 2014/2015 model years.

Key differences between the X-Runner and the other packages include tweaks to the suspension, hood scoop, ground effects kit, driving lights, sports wheel and tires, and a 3.15 final drive ratio (3.73 for V6 PreRunner and 4X4). Toyota added a rear-mounted X-Brace to stiffen up the rear end (hence the name X-Runner). The chassis was further stiffened by adding two more support braces to the frame. An optional big brake kit by TRD is also available on the X-Runner; which consists of a 332 mm slotted rotor and 4 piston caliper. The BBK (big brake kit) was designed by StopTech. To further its track and sport appeal, TRD also offered a dealer-installed and warrantied roots-style supercharger which raised the power from and the torque was raised from .
A factory TRD composite spoiler was also an option but originals are rare. The X-Runner comes only with an Aisin RA60 6-speed manual transmission.

Production numbers are unknown but it is believed roughly 3,000 X-runners were made each model year.

=== Production ===
The second generation Tacomas were assembled in Tijuana, Mexico and Fremont, California while the plastic/composite beds were all built in Mexico. After the bankruptcy of GM, GM ended its joint venture with Toyota. Toyota, needing additional production volume at its Texas and Mississippi plants, ended Corolla and Tacoma production at the Fremont plant. In 2010 all Tacoma production was moved to Toyota&#x27;s Texas plant in San Antonio alongside the Tundra. This brought a total of approximately 1,000 new jobs to San Antonio.

=== Safety and structural integrity ===
The Tacoma comes standard with anti-lock brakes, brake assist, and electronic brakeforce distribution. For 2008, a rollover sensor was added which would deploy the side curtain airbags in the event of rollover in Tacomas equipped with the optional side airbags. Beginning with the 2009 model year, all Tacomas feature Toyota&#x27;s Star Safety System which added Vehicle Stability Control and traction control. Front row side torso airbags and side curtain airbags for both rows also become standard as well as active head restraints.

Given the smaller size of pickup trucks in the Tacoma&#x27;s category, crash testing for these sized trucks lags with how well most full size trucks perform. However, in an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) test of the Tacoma and other small trucks, only the side airbag equipped Tacoma received the highest overall rating of &quot;Good&quot; in the side impact test. The Tacoma also is rated &quot;Good&quot; in the frontal offset crash test. In 2009 with the active head restraints the Tacoma is given the IIHS&#x27;s &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award.

== Third generation (N300; 2015) ==

The new Tacoma was officially unveiled at the January 2015 North American International Auto Show, with sales in the United States beginning on September 10, 2015. Dimensionally and mechanically, the N300 Tacoma is similar to the preceding generation.

=== Styling ===
The truck features a revised exterior design inspired by the 2014 model year 4Runner SUV and Tundra pickup. Changes include a larger grille, new projector-beam headlamps, and a redesigned tailgate and bed with an integrated spoiler and debossed Tacoma logo.

The N300 Tacoma is available in Access Cab and Double Cab configurations, offering long or short bed sizes. The Regular Cab model was discontinued for the new generation. The Access Cab comes with a single bed option measuring 73.7 inches (187 cm), while the Double Cab has a standard bed length of 60.5 inches (154 cm), with the 73.7-inch (187 cm) bed available as an option.

For the interior of the Tacoma, Toyota incorporated a handlebar theme and introduced a larger touchscreen display and a new instrument panel. The previous generation&#x27;s hard plastics were replaced with soft-touch materials, and a leather option was introduced. Toyota improved sound insulation with an acoustic windshield, better insulated doors, and additional weather stripping to reduce road and wind noise. Dual climate control was introduced for the first time in the Tacoma.

Unlike the second-generation models, the 2016 and 2017 Tacoma steering wheel controls had reduced functionality, limiting convenience when browsing phone contacts or selecting songs. The steering wheel D-pad controls were no longer linked to the Entune system for browsing and selecting contacts or scrolling through music lists. Instead, drivers had to rely on voice controls or use the center console display&#x27;s capacitive touchscreen. These limitations were removed starting with the 2018 model year.

==== 2020 facelift ====
In the 2020 model year, the Tacoma received a facelift, which included exterior updates.

Inside, new technologies were introduced, including wired Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa capability. The SR5 model and higher trims featured a power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, while the Tacoma Limited Double Cab offered a new Panoramic View Monitor providing a 360-degree bird&#x27;s-eye view of the truck&#x27;s surroundings.

=== Technical ===
Toyota offers a 2.7-liter &quot;2TR-FE&quot; I4 engine paired with a 5-speed manual (MY2016-17) or 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FKS&quot; V6 engine paired with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5-liter V6 can run on a simulated Atkinson cycle using VVT-iW, and feature Toyota&#x27;s D-4S system which allows it to switch from port injection to direct injection based on driving conditions.
;Notes
Based on the SAE J2807 tow guidelines the Tacoma can tow up to with the added tow package.

Similar wheelbase lengths of (Access Cab and Double Cab with short bed) and (Double Cab with long bed) are carried over from the preceding N2x0 generation. In addition to this, Toyota updated the truck&#x27;s frame by adding more high-strength steel in order to increase the truck&#x27;s rigidity and to drop weight. The body is also constructed using ultra-high-strength steel that was integrated using a new hot stamping process that reduces weight. Toyota also updated the suspensions, rear differentials, and rear axle to improve the truck&#x27;s road manners while still keeping it off-road capable. 2WD and 4WD models share the same suspension height and ground clearance.

==== TRD Lift Kit ====
In January 2021, the Tacoma TRD Lift Kit was made available as a dealer-installed option for 2020 and newer Tacoma models. The kit includes Bilstein shocks fitted with TRD red dust boots and &quot;Tuned by TRD&quot; graphics. Total frame ground clearance increases by with the suspension lift kit.

=== Trims ===
The truck is available in 6 trim levels: base SR, mid-level SR5, TRD Off-Road, TRD Sport, Limited, and range-topping TRD Pro.

The TRD Off-Road trim models feature an all-new terrain select mode which allows the driver to choose between different types of terrain such as: loose rock, mud, and sand. Toyota also announced a new Crawl mode that will allow the driver to steer the truck in tough terrain while the truck manages braking and acceleration by itself. In addition to this the truck also features a moonroof, keyless entry, Qi Wireless phone charging capability, easy lower tailgate, blind-spot monitoring system, backup camera (standard) and a mounted GoPro holder (standard).

Toyota also introduced a TRD Pro version in late 2016 for the 2017 model year, which comes with FOX-patented Internal Bypass shocks, TRD Pro catback exhaust, TRD Pro skid plate, Rigid Industries LED fog lights, and heritage inspired &#x27;TOYOTA&#x27; grille. The 2017 model year TRD Pro was only available in the double cab short bed configuration, with either a manual or automatic gearbox in Barcelona Red Metallic, Super White, or Cement. Black leather with red accents and stitching is the only available interior option. For the 2018 model year TRD Pro, Midnight Black Metallic and Cavalry Blue are new available exterior colors, with Barcelona Red Metallic and Cement discontinued. In 2021, for the 2022 model year, the &#x27;Trail&#x27; special edition was introduced in Army Green, with Lunar Rock color following in 2022. Heritage-inspired bronze color wheels and grille pay homage to earlier 4WD Toyota pickups.

=== Production ===
The Tacoma&#x27;s transition to its third generation took place while the segment is growing. In 2014, the San Antonio plant built 105,796 Tacomas and the Baja plant built 71,399 for a total of 177,195. In 2015, the San Antonio plant built 110,911 and Baja built 82,328 for a total of 193,239 built. In 2016, 191,673 Tacomas were sold in the US and Canada (along with 115,489 Tundras also built in San Antonio) and, with the mid size segment up overall, the San Antonio plant was running costlier extra Saturday shifts to keep up with demand, running at 125 percent of projected plant capacity. The 2016 and 2017 model year double-cab short-bed Tacomas are currently made in Tijuana (VINs starting in 3) and all other Tacoma configurations are made in San Antonio (VINs starting in 5). Toyota USA announced it intended to increase production at the Tijuana plant in 2018 from about 100,000 to 160,000 Tacomas.

The 2022 Tacoma was tested by the IIHS:

== Fourth generation (N400; 2023) ==
The fourth-generation Toyota Tacoma was revealed on May 19, 2023. It is built on Toyota&#x27;s TNGA-F global body-on-frame vehicle platform, shared with the larger Toyota Tundra (XK70). The Tacoma was designed by teams at Toyota&#x27;s Calty Design Research facilities in California and Michigan with the intention &quot;to be authentic to the way our customers use their trucks for rugged outdoor fun&quot;, according to Calty president Kevin Hunter, who explained the truck was styled with &quot;the iconic Tacoma look, referred to as &#x27;Tacoma-ness, including &quot;high lift, big tires, slim body, and a powerful athletic stance&quot; as inspired by prior Toyota Baja trophy racing trucks.

=== Trims ===

The fourth-generation Tacoma is available in eight trim levels, six of which are carried over from the previous generation: SR, SR5, Limited, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and TRD Pro, along with a newly-added Trailhunter with overlanding-specific equipment and the return of the TRD PreRunner, an off-road oriented two-wheel drive trim, last offered in the second-generation Tacoma. Toyota considers the TRD Pro and Trailhunter to be the halo model of the line.

The TRD Pro trim level includes IsoDynamic seats for the driver and front passenger which control motion through a series of four adjustable shock absorbers, Fox Factory racing shocks, and is taller and wider than the SR5.

The Trailhunter grade includes a suspension designed by ARB using Old Man Emu components. Externally, it can be distinguished by a standard snorkel engine air intake and bronze-colored accents.

The TRD PreRunner is available exclusively with the XtraCab body and rear-wheel-drive.

=== Chassis and body ===
The TNGA-F platform uses laser-welded high-strength steel frame members to increase rigidity, and aluminum body components to reduce weight. All Tacomas are equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, with an electronic parking brake and electric power steering.

Two cab configurations are available: an extended cab (marketed as &quot;XtraCab,&quot; a brand used for the first-generation Tacoma and the earlier Toyota Pickup) and a crew cab (which Toyota brands as Double Cab). Most Tacomas will be built as a four-door Double Cab and will be available with a choice of a or bed, both with coil-sprung rear axles.

The XtraCab is a two-door, two-seat configuration. Unlike prior generations, the XtraCab will not be equipped with rear jump seats, instead having an interior lockable cargo storage area. Toyota removed the seats and rear-hinged half-doors for the 4th-generation after surveying customers and sales data, discovering 50% of the third-generation Access Cab truck buyers specified a rear seat delete (part of the utility package) and of the customers that had purchased the back seats, 30% had never used them and 39% used them less than once a month. By eliminating the doors, Toyota could avoid the significant expense of engineering the doors to pass side-impact crash testing. The XtraCab body will only be available with the SR, SR5, and TRD PreRunner trim levels and will only use the longer bed with a leaf-sprung rear axle.

=== Drivetrain ===
The fourth-generation Tacoma is built around the 2.4-liter &quot;T24A-FTS&quot; turbocharged inline-four engine producing and of torque, depending on trim and transmission, or a parallel hybrid version marketed as &quot;i-Force Max&quot;, producing a total of and of torque. Most engines will be mated to an eight-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, however a six-speed manual transmission with automatic rev matching and anti-stall technology will be available on some trims.

The i-Force Max hybrid engine in the Tacoma differs from the Hybrid Max powertrain in the 2023 Crown and 2024 Grand Highlander, which uses the same &quot;T24A-FTS&quot; engine. Unlike the aforementioned models, the Tacoma has a longitudinal engine, including the i-Force Max hybrid engine. i-Force Max has a single electric traction assist motor/generator between the engine and transmission, but otherwise shares the same basic transfer case and mechanical driveshaft running gear with non-hybrid Tacomas.

;Notes


All Tacomas are equipped with an automatic limited-slip differential for the rear axle. Four-wheel-drive models have a two-speed (high and low range), electronically-controlled transfer case; TRD (PreRunner, Off-Road, and Pro) and Trailhunter trims upgrade the rear differential to an electronically-locking version, and the Limited trim includes full-time all-wheel-drive with a center locking differential when equipped with the optional i-Force Max hybrid engine.

=== 2024 X-Runner Concept ===

Toyota revived the X-Runner name and applied it to a concept version of the 2024 Tacoma, debuting it at the 2023 SEMA Show. It is fitted with a modified version of the i-Force Max V6 engine utilized by the larger Tundra and Sequoia, as well as the Tundra&#x27;s air suspension that allows the Tacoma X-Runner to sit at a much lower height. It is also fitted with the Tundra&#x27;s 10-Speed Automatic transmission. The engine in the X-Runner Concept puts out 421 horsepower, a significant increase over the already powerful four-cylinder hybrid engine the production Tacoma gets, which itself puts out a generous 326 horsepower. The exhaust pipes have been rerouted to the sides of the truck, right below the rocker panels. The frame was strengthened and the track was widened by 3-inches, giving the truck a bolder stance. The X-Runner Concept is fitted with a custom body kit and is painted in Speedway Blue, the same color used on the original X-Runner that appeared at the Chicago Auto Show in 2004, while the roof, mirrors, and most of the hood are painted black, with a red accent trim on the hood. The Toyota logo on the front is in red lettering. Inside the X-Runner, the seats, door trim, and glove box door are done up in red upholstery, while the rest of the interior is black. The X-Runner logo is also stitched into the headrests.

=== Safety ===
The 2024 model year Tacoma crew-cab configuration was awarded &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; by IIHS, but it did not receive the highest award as it has yet to be evaluated in the updated moderate overlap front test.

== Toyota Racing Development ==
In 1998, Toyota added a new Toyota Racing Development (TRD) off-road package. The package includes off-road tires, 16-inch alloy wheels, TRD dampers, a locking rear differential and the TRD graphics.

In 2001, Toyota introduced a TRD sport package on the Tundra full-size pickup. This package was introduced in 2005 for the Tacoma at the same time as the release of the newly redesigned Tacoma.

=== TRD supercharger ===
Toyota Racing Development offered a TRD supercharger for the FJ Cruiser and Tacoma equipped with 4.0-liter V6 engine, available through Toyota dealerships. This supercharger was co-developed with Magnuson Superchargers. When installed by a professional dealer, it would not void any warranties on a vehicle. The supercharger increases the Tacoma&#x27;s power output to from the original , and the torque output to and is now out of production.

The TRD supercharger is compatible on all 2005 through 2015 model year Tacoma trucks, and 2007 through 2009 model year FJ Cruiser SUV. This supercharger system features Eaton roots-type rotating components in a one-piece integral manifold, iridium spark plugs, and a five-rib serpentine drive belt system. It produces about of boost pressure.

The supercharger, when installed by an authorized Scion or Toyota dealer, has the same warranty as powertrain, five years or , or the balance of the new car warranty, whichever is greater. When not installed by an authorized dealer, the supercharger is covered by a 12-month, parts-only warranty. The manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price of the TRD supercharger is $4500, not including installation.

The TRD supercharger program was discontinued for all vehicles, including Tacoma, as of June 2015 due to the expense of development.

=== &quot;Back to the Future&quot; Tacoma Concept ===

On October 21, 2015, Toyota and Universal Pictures celebrated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (BTTF) with a Tacoma Concept that was inspired by the original Toyota Pickup that Toyota created for the original film. In the film, the protagonist (Marty McFly) is gifted a black Toyota (Hilux) Pickup SR5 XtraCab 4×4 when he returns to 1985. The Hilux has been modified with extra lights, tubular bumpers, and aftermarket wheels and tires; the popularity of the film has led to numerous recreations of the original concept. The original concept from 1985 was destroyed in a crash, and the studio recreated it for the sequels; after filming was complete, most of the modifications were stripped and the truck was sold to a private owner.

For the 30th anniversary concept, a 2016 Tacoma 4WD was modified to resemble the 1985 original, using the same features and black color paint trim, KC HiLite driving lamps (modified with LED lighting), modified headlights and taillights (matching the 1985 version), the Toyota badging to the truck&#x27;s tailgate, D-4S fuel injection, and the 1985-inspired mudflaps. The only difference between the 1985 original and the 2016 concept is the tires: Goodyear was featured in the 1985 film, while BF Goodrich is used on the concept. The concept also did not have a solid front axle like the original 1985 Pickup. Toyota notes that this is a one-off concept as there are no plans to offer it as a package or level trim. The 2016 Tacoma BTTF concept is featured in the launch campaign for the Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, which includes some of the original actors from the film. The concept was developed by Toyota&#x27;s marketing arm, with assistance from KMA Promotion.

<text>Chaos Chaos are an American indie synthpop band based in Brooklyn, New York. The band was formed in Seattle under the name Smoosh in 2000 and adopted their current name in 2012. The band consists of two sisters, who founded the band as children: singer/keyboardist Asya &quot;Asy&quot; Saavedra (born February 2, 1992) and drummer Chloe Saavedra (born March 5, 1994). They released three LPs as Smoosh, and have produced two further EPs, several singles, and a fourth full-length album as Chaos Chaos.

==History==
===Smoosh: 2000–2012===

Smoosh started in 2000 when the family was at a Seattle music store The Trading Musician, standing in line to restring a violin. Asy and Chloe wandered into the drum section of the store, where Chloe met Jason McGerr, the drummer for Death Cab for Cutie. The family eventually left with a $600 drum kit for Chloe, McGerr&#x27;s card from the Seattle Drum School, &quot;and no violin.&quot; When McGerr learned that Asy had been playing the piano and writing songs since she was very young, he offered to help them both. Neither Asy nor Chloe read music. Asy began piano training, but she soon quit because she found it boring.

In 2000, Smoosh released &quot;Tomato Mistakes&quot;, a two-track single that they mailed free of charge to anyone who wanted it. Four years later, in September 2004, Smoosh&#x27;s full-length debut &quot;She Like Electric&quot; was released under Pattern 25 Records. By the time Smoosh released their second LP &quot;Free to Stay&quot;, on June 6, 2006, they were signed to Seattle-based indie label Barsuk Records. Its third and title track, &quot;Free to Stay&quot;, was an early song featured on &quot;Tomato Mistakes&quot;. Asy also plays guitar on the track &#x27;Waiting for Something&#x27; off &quot;Free to Stay&quot;. The second album also features the song &quot;Find A Way&quot; which Smoosh performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on July 12, 2006, marking their first performance on late night TV. As they toured with Eels as part of a world tour in mid-2006, they are also featured on the California-based band&#x27;s live DVD/CD &quot;Live and in Person! London 2006&quot;.
On August 5, 2007, Smoosh performed at Lollapalooza 2007 at Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. Their set included a cover of &quot;This Modern Love&quot; by Bloc Party, with whom they would later tour that same year in September. Earlier that year, they also headlined an east coast spring tour with The Postmarks. The band played &quot;Pajama Party Time&quot; on the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot; in 2007. The Saavedra sisters have been the only members of the band. Their younger sister, Maia Saavedra, played bass for them in 2007.

As Smoosh, critics compared the band&#x27;s sound to that of Tori Amos and PJ Harvey and were impressed with the young writers and performers. Smoosh opened for many leading Pacific Northwest bands including Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, Sleater-Kinney, and the Presidents of the United States of America, as well as for other acts such as Mates of State, Jimmy Eat World, Cat Power (who also covered their song &quot;Rad&quot;), Nada Surf, Sufjan Stevens and The Go! Team. Asy collaborated with Seattle indie band Head Like a Kite to create the songs &quot;Noisy at the Circus&quot; (which can be found on Head Like a Kite&#x27;s first album &quot;Random Portraits of the Home Movie&quot;), &quot;Daydream Vacation&quot; (which can be found on their second album &quot;There Is Loud Laughter Everywhere&quot;), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Start It All Again&quot; (which can be found on their album &quot;Dreams Suspend Night&quot;, and also available via the KEXP Song of the Day website). Asy also lends her voice to the soundtrack of the musical film &quot;God Help the Girl&quot; created by Stuart Murdoch of Belle &amp; Sebastian, where she sings on the songs &quot;I Just Want Your Jeans&quot; and &quot;A Down and Dusky Blonde&quot;. She also provided the vocals on the song &quot;I Fell for the Fall&quot; by Swedish band Karma Tree. In early 2008, they toured with Tokyo Police Club and The Dresden Dolls. In June 2010, Smoosh released their third album, &quot;Withershins&quot; (previously titled &quot;The World&#x27;s Not Bad&quot;).

===Chaos Chaos: 2012–present===

In 2012 the Saavedras changed the band&#x27;s name to Chaos Chaos, abandoning the name &quot;Smoosh&quot; because the term had become associated with Nicole &quot;Snooki&quot; Polizzi after an episode of &quot;South Park&quot;. Their current name is derived from a historical scientific name for a species of amoeba, which they liken to their music as it is &quot;simple but always changing&quot;.

Chaos Chaos released an EP, &quot;S&quot;, on October 16, 2012. On February 23, 2013, they released a single, &quot;In This Place.&quot; On October 7, 2014, Chaos Chaos released another EP, &quot;Committed to the Crime&quot;. One of its tracks, &quot;Do You Feel It?&quot;, was featured in the animated sci-fi cartoon &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; season two episode &quot;Auto Erotic Assimilation.&quot; This brought the band a lot of recognition. Chaos Chaos provided vocals to George Watsky on the song &quot;Brave New World&quot; on his album &quot;x Infinity&quot;, which released on August 19, 2016. On August 27, 2017, the duo released the single &quot;Terryfold&quot;, which features lead vocals from &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland, a longtime fan of the band. The song became the band&#x27;s first charting single when it debuted at #33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock Songs chart in September 2017.

After releasing the singles &quot;Dripping with Fire&quot; and &quot;On Turning 23&quot; in late 2017 and &quot;Pink Politics&quot; in April 2018, the band released the full-length album &quot;Chaos Chaos&quot; on May 15, 2018. To promote the album, they also began headlining their first nationwide tour on April 12 of that year.

At the request of Kim Kardashian, Chaos Chaos and Justin Roiland collaborated a second time to produce a song for Kanye West (a fan of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;) as a birthday present. It was released on West&#x27;s 41st birthday (June 8, 2018) as a single called &quot;Kanye&#x27;s B-Day Song&quot; featuring Rick and Morty.

In 2019, the band released three singles that are currently unattached to any album: &quot;Armed and Dangerous,&quot; &quot;Theaters,&quot; and &quot;Improv Song.&quot;

<text>The Hibbert Trust is a foundation associated with British Unitarianism from its inception in 1853. It was founded by Robert Hibbert (1769–1849) and originally designated the Anti-Trinitarian Fund. It awards scholarships and fellowships, supports the Hibbert Lectures, and maintained (from 1894) a chair of ecclesiastical history at Manchester College. From 1902 to 1968 it issued &quot;The Hibbert Journal.&quot;

== Foundation ==
On 19 July 1847, Hibbert executed a deed conveying to trustees $50,000 in 6% Ohio stock, and £8,000 in railway shares. The trustees, on the death of his widow, were to apply the income &#x27;in such manner as they shall from time to time deem most conducive to the spread of Christianity in its most simple and intelligible form, and to the unfettered exercise of the right of private judgment in matters of religion&#x27;. The trustees were always to be laymen. Appended was a scheme for the administration of the trust, which the trustees were empowered to revise, and were directed to revise at least once in every twenty-five years.

In the original scheme the trust was called &#x27;the Anti-trinitarian Fund&#x27;, and its object was, by a provision of divinity scholarships, to encourage learning and culture among unorthodox Christians. The breadth of the actual trust is largely due to the counsels of Hibbert&#x27;s solicitor, Edwin Wilkins Field, but, in opposition to Field, Hibbert &#x27;determined on insisting that all recipients should be hetero-dox&#x27;, his intention being &#x27;to elevate the position and the public influence of the unitarian ministry&#x27;.

== Activities ==
It has always been known that the trust was founded with a fortune made from slavery; Robert Hibbert owned plantations in Jamaica, worked by enslaved African people. When the British government abolished chattel slavery throughout most of the Empire in 1833, it awarded compensation money to the slave owners. This money passed from Robert Hibbert to his widow, who died in 1853; the couple were childless and their legacy created the Hibbert Trust.

&quot;On the 100th anniversary of Robert Hibbert&#x27;s death [i.e. 1949], it was acknowledged in the Hibbert Journal that good things are often “gathered from soil dunged deep with human suffering”, &quot; according to the current chair of trustees. In the 2020s, the trustees approached the Centre for Reparation Research at the University of the West Indies, seeking advice on a way forward.

== Trustees ==
Robert Mortimer Montgomery, who became a member of the Hibbert Trust in 1914, served as its Chairman from 1929 until three weeks before his death, in 1948.

<text>Vexillological symbols are used by vexillologists to indicate certain characteristics of flags, such as where they are used, who uses them, and what they look like. The symbols were created by vexillologist Whitney Smith and then adopted by the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV) in the early 1970s. Vexillologist Željko Heimer added the symbols for normal and historical in the early 1990s.

== Status and design symbols ==
Vexillological symbols describe information on a flag&#x27;s recognition status and design.


== Usage symbols ==
The usage symbols are based on a grid of two rows representing use on land and use on water, and three columns representing private use, public use, and military use. Each circle in the grid indicates the flag has one or more of the following six basic usages:

A single design may be associated with no usages or multiple usages. Heimer suggested an additional row for air ensigns, but it has not been adopted by FIAV. The air ensign row refers to flags displayed on aircraft, including when on the ground, and air installations. The air ensign row is placed above the remaining two rows.

<doc id="1167063" wikidata="Q16919867" url="?curid=1167063" title="Sweetheart deal">
<text>A sweetheart deal or sweetheart contract is a contractual agreement, usually worked out in secret, that greatly benefits some of the parties while inappropriately disadvantaging other parties or the public at large. The term was coined in the 1940s to describe corrupt labor contracts that were favorable to the employer rather than the workers, and usually involved some kind of kickback or special treatment for the labor negotiator. 

The term is also applied to special arrangements between private corporations and government entities, whereby the corporation and sometimes a government official reap the benefits, rather than the public. No-bid contracts may be awarded to people who have political connections or make donations to influential politicians. Sometimes a sweetheart deal involves tax breaks or other inducements to get a corporation to do business in that city or state. 

A &quot;sweetheart settlement&quot; may also occur in a legal context. For example, in a class-action lawsuit the attorneys representing a class of plaintiffs may reach an agreement with the defendant in which the primary result is a lucrative fee for the attorneys rather than maximum compensation for the class members.

==Noted instances and allegations==
*In a 1947 unionization dispute, San Francisco area grocery store owners claimed that other stores who had &quot;given in&quot; to union demands had signed sweetheart deals with the unions.
*In a 1949 dispute between the rival American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) involving unionization of the laundry industry in Indianapolis, Indiana, a lawyer for the 42 laundry and dry-cleaning plants testified before the National Labor Relations Board that an AFL union contract was not a sweetheart deal between the employers and AFL union officials, as alleged by the CIO. 
*The terms of a 2008 plea bargain to settle criminal charges against financier Jeffrey Epstein have been called a sweetheart deal by many commentators.
*The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was said to contain an obscure sweetheart deal for certain tech companies.

==Legal reform==
The 1959 Landrum-Griffin Act was a federal law that attempted to prevent sweetheart labor contracts and other forms of corrupt dealing by unions in the USA.

==2019 study==
A 2019 study examined the language of government contracts, looking for &quot;sweetheart terms&quot; – wording that is &quot;highly favorable to the firm, but not obviously advantageous to the government&quot;. They found that such language is more commonly included in contracts with firms that make political contributions.

<text>Symonston (postcode: 2609) is a primarily industrial and agricultural suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Symonston is named after Sir Josiah Symon a Legislator, Federalist and one of the Founders of the Constitution of Australia.

Located in Symonston are the Periodic Detention Centre and Symonston Temporary Remand Centre and three caravan parks: Canberra South Motor Park, Sundown Village and Narrabundah Longstay Caravan Park. Geoscience Australia has its headquarters in Symonston, as does the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

==Planning==

The Symonston area has traditionally been denoted &#x27;Broadacre&#x27; area by the planning authorities, meaning that it has retained a traditionally rural character with some larger institution uses, particularly by the Australian Defence Force and Geoscience Australia. With the release of the Canberra Spatial Plan by the ACT Government, the area and the adjoining Majura Valley has been denoted as an employment corridor centred on Canberra Airport and Fyshwick.

==Geology==
Rocks in Symonston are from the Silurian age Mount Painter Volcanics dark grey to green grey dacitic tuff underlies most of Symonston. Narrabundah Ashstone Member is found in the northern corner near the motor park. Canberra Formation, calcareous shale found to the east of the ashstone. Further to the east and over to Harman is found the dacitic andesite of the Ainslie Volcanics. An unnamed coarse leucogranite has a small out crop east of Jerrabomberra creek.

Geoscience Australia is the Australian Government organisation tasked with supplying scientific information and knowledge about the geography and geology of Australia. It has information about the geology of the whole of Australia including Canberra.


==Education==
Symonston residents get preference for:
*Depending on the address: Forrest Primary or Red Hill Primary
*Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

<text>The Horny Horns were a horn section associated with Parliament-Funkadelic and Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band led by trombonist Fred Wesley. The group also featured saxophonist Maceo Parker and Rick Gardner and Richard &quot;Kush&quot; Griffith on trumpets.

While they are best known for their contributions to other P-Funk projects, The Horny Horns also recorded two albums under their own name, &quot;A Blow for Me, A Toot for You&quot; (1977) and &quot;Say Blow By Blow Backwards&quot; (1979). A compilation of unreleased tracks was released in 1994 on the CD &quot;The Final Blow&quot;.

They have frequently played with other notable artists, such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, on &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;″s &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot;, and on Deee-Lite&#x27;s 1990 hit &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;.

<text>Joshua Frederick Cockey Talbott (July 29, 1843 – October 5, 1918) was a U.S. Congressman who represented the second Congressional district of Maryland.

==Biography==
He was born near Lutherville, Maryland on July 29, 1843. He began to study law in 1862 but joined the Confederate Army during the American Civil War in 1864 to serve in the Second Maryland Cavalry. Following the war, Talbott was admitted to the bar in 1866 and began to practice law in Towson, Maryland.

In 1878, after several years of activity in Democratic politics and local civic affairs, he was elected to the U.S. Congress. Except for the periods 1885 to 1893, during which he served for a time as Insurance Commissioner for Maryland, and 1894 to 1902, he served in Congress until his death. Talbott was a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee for 25 years and worked unceasingly for a strong and modern Navy.

He died in Lutherville on October 5, 1918, and is interred in Sherwood Cemetery of Cockeysville, Maryland.

<doc id="1167077" wikidata="Q2665761" url="?curid=1167077" title="Delaware languages">
<text>The Delaware languages, also known as the Lenape languages (), are Munsee and Unami, two closely related languages of the Eastern Algonquian subgroup of the Algonquian language family. Munsee and Unami were spoken aboriginally by the Lenape people in the vicinity of the modern New York City area in the United States, including western Long Island, Manhattan Island, Staten Island, as well as adjacent areas on the mainland: southeastern New York State, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and Delaware.

==Classification==
The Lenape language is part of the Algonquian branch of the Algic language family, and is part of the Eastern Algonquian language grouping which is considered to be a genetically related sub-grouping of Algonquian.

The languages of the Algonquian family constitute a group of historically related languages descended from a common source language, Proto-Algonquian, which was descended from Algic. The Algonquian languages are spoken across Canada from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast; on the American Plains; south of the Great Lakes; and on the Atlantic coast. Many of the Algonquian languages are now sleeping.

The Eastern Algonquian languages, spoken on the Atlantic coast from what are now called the Canadian Maritime provinces to what is now called North Carolina; many of the languages are now sleeping, and some are known only from very fragmentary records. Eastern Algonquian is considered a genetic subgroup within the Algonquian family, that is, the Eastern Algonquian languages share a sufficient number of common innovations to suggest that they descend from a common intermediate source, Proto-Eastern Algonquian.
The linguistic closeness of Munsee and Unami entails that they share an immediate common ancestor which may be called &quot;Common Delaware;&quot; the two languages have diverged in distinct ways from Common Delaware.

Several shared phonological innovations support a genetic subgroup consisting of the Delaware languages and Mahican, sometimes referred to as &quot;Delawaran&quot;. Nonetheless Unami and Munsee are more closely related to each other than to Mahican. Some historical evidence suggests commonalities between Mahican and Munsee.

The line of historical descent is therefore Proto-Algonquian &gt; Proto-Eastern Algonquian &gt; Delawarean &gt; Common Delaware + Mahican, with Common Delaware splitting into Munsee and Unami.

==Geographic distribution==
&quot;Lenni Lenape&quot; means &#x27;Human Beings&#x27; or the &#x27;Real People&#x27; in the Unami language. Their autonym is also spelled &quot;Lennape&quot; or &quot;Lenapi&quot;, in Unami and in Munsee meaning &#x27;the people.&#x27; The term &quot;Delaware&quot; was used by the English, who named the people for their territory by the Delaware River. They named the river in honor of Lord De La Warr, the governor of the colony at Jamestown, Virginia. The English colonists used the exonym &quot;Delaware&quot; for almost all the Lenape people living along this river and its tributaries.

It is estimated that as late as the 17th century there were approximately forty Lenape local village bands with populations of possibly a few hundred persons per group. Estimates for the early contact period vary considerably, with a range of 8,00012,000 given. Other estimates for approximately 1600 AD suggest 6,500 Unami and 4,500 Munsee, with data lacking for Long Island Munsee. These groups were never united politically or linguistically, and the names &quot;Delaware, &quot; &quot;Munsee, &quot; and &quot;Unami&quot; postdate the period of consolidation of these local groups. The earliest use of the term &quot;Munsee&quot; was recorded in 1727, and &quot;Unami&quot; in 1757.

At the time of first contact of Europeans colonizers in the 17th century, the Lenape resided in relatively small communities consisting of a few hundred people. The intensity of contact with European settlers resulted in the gradual displacement of some of the Lenape people from their aboriginal homeland, in a series of population movements of genocidal intent involving forced relocation and consolidation of small local groups, extending over a period of more than two hundred years. This is also referred to as The Long Walk. It was due to the new United States breaking the first treaty it had ever signed. The currently used names were gradually applied to the larger groups resulting from the genocidal forced relocation policy of the United States. The ultimate result was the displacement of virtually all Lenape-speaking people from the region to present-day Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, Upstate New York, and Canada.

Two distinct Unami-speaking groups emerged in Oklahoma in the late 19th century, the Registered (Cherokee) Delaware in Washington, Nowata, and Craig Counties, and the Absentee Delaware of Caddo County. Until recently there were a small number of Unami speakers in Oklahoma; the language is now extinct there as a first language, but is spoken fluently as a learned language by enrolled members of the two Delaware tribes in Oklahoma. Some language revitalization work is underway by the Delaware Tribe of Indians.

Equally affected by consolidation and dispersal, Munsee groups moved to several locations in southern Ontario as early as the late 18th century, to Moraviantown, Munceytown, and Six Nations. Several different patterns of migration led to groups of Munsee speakers moving to Stockbridge in present-day Wisconsin, Cattaraugus in present-day New York state, and Kansas. In 1892 the Munsee-Delaware and Moraviantown children were sent to Mount Elgin Residential School where only English language was permitted to be spoken. The Lenape language began its disappearance along the Grand River in Six Nations and to rapidly vanish in Munsee-Delaware Nation. Only in Moraviantown the Lenape language was used on a daily basis from a majority of the nation and help on the preservation of the language. Today Munsee survives only at Moraviantown, where there are two fluent first language speakers aged 77 and 90 as of 2018. There are no fluent speakers left in the Munsee-Delaware nation of the Lenape people living in Canada; however, there are members that are working to revitalize the language within the community.

=== Language revitalization ===
From 2009 through at least 2014, a Lenape language class was taught at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The class focused on beginner phrases and grammar, but also included information about the history and culture of the Lenape people. Books used in the class included &quot;Conversations in Lenape Language&quot; and &quot;Advanced Supplements&quot; (both written by De Paul).

=== Dialects and varieties ===
Munsee and Unami are linguistically very similar. They are both dialects of one language by Lenape speakers, and together are referred to as the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians, as can be seen in the &quot;Grammar of the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians&quot;, written by the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger and published in a translation from German into English by Peter Stephen du Ponceau in 1827. Zeisberger does not even mention the &quot;dialect&quot; names when describing varying grammatical features, while the translator refers to them in two annotations. Despite their relative closeness the two are sufficiently distinguished by features of syntax, phonology, and vocabulary that speakers of both consider them not mutually intelligible so that, more recently, linguists have treated them as separate languages.

Munsee Delaware was spoken in the central and lower Hudson River Valley, western Long Island, the upper Delaware River Valley, and the northern third of New Jersey in present-day North Jersey. While dialect variation in Munsee was likely there is no information about possible dialectal subgroupings.

Unami Delaware was spoken in the area south of Munsee speakers in the Delaware River Valley and New Jersey, south of the Delaware Water Gap and the Raritan Valley.

Three dialects of Unami are distinguished: Northern Unami, Southern Unami, and Unalachtigo.

Northern Unami, now extinct, is recorded in large amounts of materials collected by Moravian missionaries but is not reflected in the speech of any modern groups. The Northern Unami groups were south of the Munsee groups, with the southern boundary of the Northern Unami area being at Tohickon Creek on the west bank of the Delaware River and between Burlington and Trenton on the east bank.

The poorly known Unalachtigo dialect is described as having been spoken in the area between Northern and Southern Unami, with only a small amount of evidence from one group.

Southern Unami, to the south of the Northern Unami-Unalachtigo area, is reflected in the Unami Delaware spoken by Delawares in Oklahoma.

===Ethnonyms===
Names for the speakers of Munsee and Unami are used in complex ways in both English and the Lenape language. The Unami dialect (called a language by non-native speaker students of Lenape) is sometimes called &quot;Delaware&quot; or &quot;Delaware proper,&quot; reflecting the original application of the term &quot;Delaware&quot; to Unami speakers. Both Munsee and Unami speakers use &quot;Delaware&quot; if enrolled and &quot;Lenape&quot; if not enrolled as a self-designation in English.

The Unamis residing in Oklahoma are sometimes referred to as &quot;Oklahoma Delaware&quot;, while the Munsees in Ontario are sometimes referred to as &quot;Ontario Delaware&quot; or &quot;Canadian Delaware.&quot;

Munsee-speaking residents of Moraviantown use the English term &quot;Munsee&quot; to refer to residents of Munceytown, approximately to the east and refer to themselves in English as &quot;Delaware&quot;, and in Munsee as &#x27;Delaware person, Indian&#x27;. Oklahoma Delawares refer to Ontario Delaware as or , terms that are also used for people of Munsee ancestry in their own communities.

Some Delawares at Moraviantown also use the term &quot;Christian Indian&quot; as a preferred self-designation in English. The equivalent Munsee term is , meaning &quot;one who prays, Moravian convert&quot;.

Munsee speakers refer to Oklahoma Delawares as &quot;Unami&quot; in English or in Munsee. The Oklahoma Delawares refer to themselves in English as &quot;Delaware&quot; and in Unami as .

The name &quot;Lenape&quot;, which is sometimes used in English for both Delaware languages together, is the name Unami speakers also use for their own language in English, whereas Munsee speakers call their language in English . Uniquely among scholars, Kraft uses &quot;Lenape&quot; as a cover term to refer to all Delaware-speaking groups.

Munsee speakers refer to their language as , meaning &quot;speaking the Delaware language&quot;.

==Phonology==
Munsee and Unami have similar but not identical inventories of consonants and vowels, and have a significant number of phonological rules in common. For example, both languages share the same basic rules for assigning syllable weight and stress. However, Unami has innovated by regularizing the assignment of stress in some verb forms so that the penultimate syllable is stressed even when the stress assignment rule would predict stress on the antepenultimate syllable. As well, Unami has innovated relative to Munsee by adding phonological rules that significantly change the pronunciation of many Unami words relative to the corresponding Munsee words.

This section focuses upon presenting general information about Munsee and Unami sounds and phonology, with detailed discussion reserved for entries for each language.

Munsee and Unami have the same basic inventories of consonants, as in the following chart.

In addition, Unami is analysed as having contrastive long voiceless stops: , , , ; and long voiceless fricatives: , , and . The raised dot is used to indicate length of a preceding consonant or vowel. A full analysis and description of the status of the long consonants is not available, and more than one analysis of Delaware consonants has been proposed. Some analyses only recognize long stops and fricatives as predictable, i.e. as arising by rule. The contrastive long consonants are described as having low functional yield, that is, they differentiate relatively few pairs of words, but nonetheless do occur in contrasting environments. Both languages have rules that lengthen consonants in certain environments.

Several additional consonants occur in Munsee loan words: in e.g. &#x27;I vote&#x27;; in .

A number of alternate analyses of Munsee and Unami vowels have been proposed. In one, the two languages are analysed as having the same basic vowel system, consisting of four long vowels , and two short vowels . This vowel system is equivalent to the vowel system reconstructed for Proto-Eastern-Algonquian. Alternative analyses reflect several differences between the two languages. In this analysis Munsee is analysed as having contrasting length in all positions, with the exception of . In cells with two vowels, the first is long.

Similarly, Unami vowels have also been analysed as organized into contrasting long-short pairs. One asymmetry is that high short is paired with long , and the pairing of long and short is noteworthy. In cells with two vowels, the first is long.

==Vocabulary==

===Loan words===

Both Munsee and Unami have loan words from European languages, reflecting early patterns of contact between Delaware speakers and European traders and settlers. The first Europeans to have sustained contact with the Delaware were Dutch explorers and traders, and loan words from Dutch are particularly common. Dutch is the primary source of loan words in Munsee and Unami.

Because many of the early encounters between Delaware speakers and Dutch explorers and settlers occurred in Munsee territory, Dutch loanwords are particularly common in Munsee, although there are also a number in Unami as well.

Many Delaware borrowings from Dutch are nouns that name items of material culture that were presumably salient or novel for Delaware speakers, as is reflected in the following borrowed words.

More recent borrowings tend to be from English such as the following Munsee loan words: &#x27;automobile&#x27;; &#x27;cutter&#x27;; &#x27;s/he votes&#x27;.

There is one known Swedish loan word in Unami: &#x27;chicken&#x27;, from Swedish , &#x27;a call to chickens&#x27;.

==Writing systems==
There is no standard writing system for either Munsee or Unami. However, the people who are enrolled in the Delaware Tribe of Indians have developed a spelling system that is the most recent standard for writing in the Unami dialect. Out of respect to this intellectual property of The Delaware Tribe of Indians their standard for writing in the Unami dialect should be used. As well, the Muncy at the Six Nations Reserve in what is now called Canada have done the same standardization for the Munsee dialect. In Aboriginal teaching materials used by provincial governments this newest standard for Munsee is used in order to teach Muncy to children in the school system.

Linguists have tended to use common phonetic transcription symbols of the type found in the International Phonetic Alphabet or similar Americanist symbols in order to represent sounds that are not consistently represented in conventional standard writing systems.

Europeans writing down Delaware words and sentences have tended to use adaptations of European alphabets and associated conventions. The quality of such renditions have varied widely, as Europeans attempted to record sounds and sound combinations they were not familiar with.

Practical orthographies for both Munsee and Unami have been created in the context of various language preservation and documentation projects. A recent bilingual dictionary of Munsee uses a practical orthography derived from a linguistic transcription system for Munsee. The same system is also used in a recent word book produced locally at Moraviantown.

The online Unami &quot;Lenape Talking Dictionary&quot; uses a practical system distinct from that for Munsee. However, other practically oriented Unami materials use a writing system with conventional phonetic symbols.

===Writing system samples===
The table below presents a sample of Unami words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system. The linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable stress and a raised dot (·) to indicate vowel and consonant length. The practical system interprets the contrast between long and corresponding short vowels as one of quality, using acute and grave accents to indicate vowel quality. Stress, which as noted is predictable, and consonant length are not indicated in the practical system.

The table below presents a sample of Munsee words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system. The linguistic system uses a raised dot to indicate vowel length. Although stress is mostly predictable, the linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable main stress. As well, predictable voiceless or murmured is indicated with the breve accent . Similarly, the breve accent is used to indicate an ultra-short that typically occurs before a single voiced consonant followed by a vowel. The practical system indicates vowel length by doubling the vowel letter, and maintains the linɡuistic system&#x27;s practices for marking stress and voiceless/ultra-short vowels. The practical system uses orthographic for the phonetic symbol , and for the phonetic symbol .

<doc id="1167097" wikidata="Q211001" url="?curid=1167097" title="Fourth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty IV) is characterized as a &quot;golden age&quot; of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Dynasty IV lasted from to 2494 BC. It was a time of peace and prosperity as well as one during which trade with other countries is documented.

The Fourth Dynasty heralded the height of the pyramid-building age. The relative peace of the Third Dynasty allowed the Dynasty IV rulers the leisure to explore more artistic and cultural pursuits. King Sneferu&#x27;s building experiments led to the evolution from the mastaba-styled step pyramids to the smooth sided “true” pyramids, such as those on the Giza Plateau. No other period in Egypt&#x27;s history equaled Dynasty IV&#x27;s architectural accomplishments. Each of the rulers of this dynasty (except for Shepseskaf, the last) commissioned at least one pyramid to serve as a tomb or cenotaph.

The Fourth Dynasty was the second of four dynasties that made up the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot;. King Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty, held territory from ancient Libya in the west to the Sinai Peninsula in the east, to Nubia in the south. It was a successful period and this era is known for its advancement and concentrated government, as seen in the organized building of pyramids and other monuments.

Knowledge of the Old Kingdom comes mainly from these structures and objects discovered in the desert cemeteries of Giza.

== Rulers ==
== Summary ==
=== Sneferu ===
Sneferu, lauded as &quot;Bringer of Beauty&quot;, &quot;Master of All Justice&quot;, and &quot;Ruler of Lower and Upper Nile&quot;, was the first pharaoh of the fourth dynasty. He descended from a family in Middle Egypt that lived near Hermopolis, and most likely ascended to the throne by marrying a royal heiress. There is still debate as to who his father was, with the credit often being given to Huni, but this cannot be confirmed due to the break in dynasties. His mother, Meresankh I was either a lesser wife or concubine of Huni.

Egypt in the Third Millennium BC was, by all accounts, a land of peace and plenty. Elites commonly ate fattened ducks and geese, and they wore fine white linens.

Until his reign, Egyptian kings were thought to be worldly incarnations of Horus, obtaining total deification exclusively in death. Sneferu was the first king to proclaim that he was the embodiment of Ra, another sun deity. Khufu would pursue his father&#x27;s path, taking the name Son of the Sun God.

On the whole, Egypt was ruled by two centers of power—legal authority and traditional authority. Legal authority constituted governing by the king, not over the people directly, but via viziers and nomarchs. Traditional authority was derived from the concept that the deities gave a king the divine right to rule as he pleased. At its heart, the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian government became organized so that only the king could direct traditional authority.

The Bent Pyramid was Sneferu&#x27;s first attempt at building a perfect structure, but it slopes and eventually bends to a lower angle, giving the structure a squished look. His Red Pyramid is widely considered the first true pyramid and earned its name from the reddish tint in the limestone used. The Red Pyramid was considered the first pyramid, approximately 150 years after the structures built by King Djoser. The Red Pyramid was the first to be given a solid foundation so that it was stable enough for a taller building. He is also said to be responsible for a series of pyramids built in Seila. He commissioned a total of three pyramids, but there are records that point to a fourth. Although he did not construct any of the pyramids at Giza, he is known as the king who moved the most stone and brick. A lot of Sneferu&#x27;s political expeditions were to other countries to secure two things: a substantial labor force and access to a large store of materials. He traveled to Nubia and Libya for these things. His incursions in these areas allowed Sneferu to secure a large labor force, so large, in fact, that it caused huge devastation to the raided countries. He also needed cattle and other food sources to provide to the people building his pyramids. By the end of his military efforts, he managed to capture 11,000 prisoners and 13,100 head of cattle.

=== Khufu ===

Khufu, known to the Greek as Cheops, and Sneferu&#x27;s successor—though it is unclear whether he was the biological son of Sneferu—was a widely known king. He is still known very well in present-day media, being featured in movies, novels, and television shows. His fame stems from his pyramid on the northeastern plateau at Giza, where he was buried. His mortuary temple was built on the northern end of the pyramid, which is no longer accessible due to ravages by grave robbers. Only three-dimensional reliefs have been recovered and have lasted into modern day, including many limestone busts and clay figurines. Khufu&#x27;s activities in and out of Egypt are not well documented (except his architecture work) and was highly romanticized by the Ancient Greeks. These Greeks felt that Khufu was a wicked man who offended the deities and forced his subjects into slavery. Khufu, as the son of Sneferu, was believed to be illegitimate and therefore unworthy of the throne. Even if he was Sneferu&#x27;s true son, he did very little to expand the country of Egypt and failed to follow his father&#x27;s footsteps. There are only a few records that stated he was involved in any political activities. The best guess historians can make is that there is evidence of construction of a harbor on the coast of the Red Sea that was excavated by John Gardner Wilkinson and James Burton in 1823.

=== Djedefre ===

Djedefre is credited by historians with a reign of eight years. Not much is known of Djedefre, including his inconclusive lineage. It is possible that he is Khufu&#x27;s son or that he was Khufu&#x27;s brother. It is widely suggested that he is the son of a lesser queen who murdered the rightful heir to the throne and Djedefre&#x27;s half brother, the crown prince Kawab. Djedefre chose to build his pyramid several kilometers north of Giza, creating speculation that there was a family feud that caused Djedefre to want to be far away from Khufu&#x27;s tomb. A more favorable conclusion was that Djedefre chose to be buried closer to Iunu, the center of the cult of Ra. His pyramid also features a statue of his wife, Hetepheres II, in the form of a sphinx. She was a daughter of Khufu and had been the wife of Kawab. It is sometimes suggested that this was the first true sphinx, although there is debate about the sphinx at Giza that was credited to Khafre. She became the longest living royal member of the dynasty, living into the reign of Shepseskaf.

Khafre, son of Khufu, succeeded his supposed brother, Djedefre, after his short reign. He chose to build his pyramid close to his father, matching it in style and being almost as large. At the front of the pyramid causeway lies the Great Sphinx that is said to bear his features. There is still debate on whether his Sphinx was erected before Djedefre&#x27;s. Khafre&#x27;s sphinx was well-known and closer to his subjects, making it harder to determine which was built first due to biased record keeping.

=== Menkaure ===
Like many kings in this dynasty, the length of Menkaure&#x27;s reign is uncertain, being projected for more than 63 years but it can certainly be an exaggeration. Menkaure succeeded his father, King Khafre. His pyramid is the third and smallest of those at Giza pyramid complex and is known as Netjer-er-Menkaure, which translates into &quot;Menkaure is Divine&quot;. There was a sarcophagus found within the pyramid, that is approximately eight feet in length and three feet in height, made of basalt. Like many of the previous pyramids, Menkaure&#x27;s was not inscribed, the interior having no record keeping of any kind.

=== Shepseskaf ===
Shepseskaf is generally accepted as the last king of the Fourth Dynasty, succeeding Menkaure. There is no conclusive evidence of who his mother is, though it is believed that he was the son of a minor queen. Who his wife was also is unknown. Shepseskaf broke the chain of pyramid building by the previous five kings. Instead of a triangular pyramid, he chose to construct a rectangular block, commonly known as the Mastabat al-Fir’aun (&quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Bench&quot;). In like fashion, however, little script was found inside his tomb and he was buried in very simple terms.

== Other notable individuals ==
=== Baka ===
The identification of Baka is unresolved. Several ancient lists of kings have survived. They do not agree, however, and none of them may be considered complete. The Turin King List has a lacuna between Khafre and Menkaure, where the author had listed a king who reigned between these two pharaohs. The name of the king and length of the reign are completely lost in the lacuna.
The Saqqara Tablet also notes a king between Khafre and Menkaure, but here too, the name is lost.
Some authorities have equated this king with Bikheris, on Manetho&#x27;s list, who could correspond to the Egyptian name &quot;Baka&quot; or &quot;Bakare&quot;.

=== Khentkaus I ===
Perhaps the most intriguing evidence of the fourth dynasty is the status of Khentkaus I, also known as Khentykawes. She was a daughter of Menkaure and her tomb was built along the Menkaure causeway. She may have ruled as king.

Her tomb is a large mastaba tomb, with another off-center mastaba placed above it. The second mastaba could not be centered over her primary mastaba because of the free, unsupported, space in the rooms below.

On a granite doorway leading into her tomb, Khentkaus I is given titles that may be read either as &quot;mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt&quot;, as &quot;mother of the king of upper and lower Egypt and king of upper and lower Egypt&quot;, or, as one scholar reads it, &quot;king of upper and lower Egypt and mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt&quot;.

Furthermore, her depiction on this doorway also gives her the full trappings of kingship, including the false beard of the king. This depiction and the title given have led some Egyptologists to suggest that she reigned as king near the end of the fourth dynasty.

Her tomb was finished in a characteristic niche style of architecture, however, the niches were later filled in with a smooth casing of limestone.

== Age of the Pyramids ==

The &quot;Age of the Pyramids&quot; refers to the fact that the Fourth Dynasty was the time when most of the well-known pyramids were built, which include those at Giza. King Sneferu was the first king to express an interest in funerary rites and tombs, which led him to the planning of the largest pyramid at Egypt. His first pyramids were called the Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid. The &quot;Age of the Pyramids&quot; was not just about the building of large and easily recognizable structures, but also a change in funerary practices and rituals. This includes the burying of elites in large structures and the use of extensive mummification.

=== Religious changes ===
The Fourth Dynasty is where we truly see a shift in religious practices where worship of the Sun was commonplace. The Cult of Ra grew in size, going back to the fact that Djedefre&#x27;s tomb was built closer to the center of worship in what the Ancient Greeks called Heliopolis. It was a delta city near contemporary Cairo that had been occupied since the predynastic times, whose ancient Egyptian name was I͗wnw or Iunu and meant &quot;the pillars&quot;.

During the era when centralization of the nation&#x27;s material, organic, and human resources began to develop, a relationship of the king to the deities became unchallenged and kings began carving their names into statues and monuments that previously had been reserved for deities. This speaks to a type of god complex on part of the kings. Khafre&#x27;s famous statue, where a falcon was incorporated into his headgear, equated the king to the god Horus.

This fact, however, caused controversy. It was pitting Khafre&#x27;s allegiance to Horus against the growing Cult of Ra, not far away in Helipolis. Kings no longer associated pyramids with the afterlife. The afterlife was once believed to be a divine kingdom that was represented as a type of idealistic heaven where only kings and pure hearts could go. Instead, the Fourth Dynasty represented a change in this idea, formulated the notion that the afterlife was a familiar place, taking the semblance of Earth. Religious rituals were notoriously conservative, from what historians know, and there is much to be desired from current known records.

=== Changing customs drove architectural changes ===

The Old Kingdom saw a rise in the preservation of the deceased, making the preparation of bodies much more complex. The position of embalmer was created, and their jobs were solely to prepare a corpse in private. There were three ways to mummify a body: 1) Stucco: the body would be wrapped in fine linen and then covered in stucco plaster, the features of the body (including the face) were remodeled in the plaster; 2) Linen: the body would be wrapped in linen, which was sometimes treated with natron (a mixture of multiple sodium carbonates) and the linens would be treated with resin so that the features of the body could be modeled; and 3) Defleshing: removing all flesh and wrapping the bones in linens. Generally, organs were removed which were then put into jars that would accompany the body in the tomb, and the inside of the body flushed out.

Tombs in the Fourth Dynasty changed drastically. &quot;Unimpressive&quot; graves did not satisfy the elites, meaning they would settle for smaller structures if the interior was decorated. Hieroglyphic writings were important to elites because, one, it was a lavish display of wealth and, two, it guided their souls to the afterlife. The Fourth Dynasty, however, did not have these writings. Instead, the tomb was deeper and super-structures were larger. After the Giza pyramid complex, later generations of tombs were more reasonably sized. After the Middle Kingdom, royals abandoned pyramids; they preferred graves that were carved into living rock of the Upper Egyptian mountains.

<text>Tonsil stones, also known as tonsilloliths, are mineralizations of debris within the crevices of the tonsils. When not mineralized, the presence of debris is known as chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). Symptoms may include bad breath, foreign body sensation, sore throat, pain or discomfort with swallowing, and cough. Generally there is no pain, though there may be the feeling of something present. The presence of tonsil stones may be otherwise undetectable; however, some people have reported seeing white material in the rear of their throat.
Risk factors may include recurrent throat infections. Tonsil stones contain a biofilm composed of a number of different bacteria, and calcium salts, either alone or in combination with other mineral salts. While they most commonly occur in the palatine tonsils, they may also occur in the adenoids, lingual tonsils and tubal tonsil. Tonsil stones have been recorded weighing from 0.3g to 42g, and they are typically small in size. However, there are occasional reports of large tonsilloliths. They are often discovered during medical imaging for other reasons and more recently, due to the impact and influence of social media platforms such as TikTok, medical professionals have experienced an increase in patient concern and tonsillolith evaluations.
They are usually benign, so if tonsil stones do not bother the patient, no treatment is needed. However in rare cases, tonsilloliths have presented patients with further complications necessitating surgical extraction. Tonsilloliths that exceed the average size are typically seen in older individuals as the likelihood of developing tonsil stones is linear. Otherwise, gargling with salt water and manual removal may be tried. Chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride may also be tried. Surgical treatment may include partial or complete tonsil removal. Up to 10% of people have tonsil stones. Biological sex does not influence the chance of having tonsil stones, but older people are more commonly affected. Many people opt to extract their own tonsil stones manually or with developments in dental hygiene products. Water flossers have become a more common mechanism to extract tonsilloliths and alleviate the discomfort and complications they exacerbate. Tonsil stones can become dislodged on their own while eating, drinking, gargling, and coughing. Additionally, an exhalation technique that vigorously shakes the tonsils may be performed to dislodge them. This involves loudly producing a voiceless velar fricative sound, at various pitches to shake both the palatine and lingual tonsils.

==Signs and symptoms==
Tonsil stones may produce no symptoms or they may be associated with bad breath. In fact, many dental professionals argue that tonsil stones are the leading cause of bad breath in their patients. The smell may be that of rotting eggs. Tonsil stones tend to happen most often in people with longterm inflammation in their tonsils.

Occasionally there may be pain when swallowing. Even when they are large, some tonsil stones are only discovered incidentally on X-rays or CAT scans. Other symptoms include a metallic taste, throat closing or tightening, coughing fits, itchy throat, and choking.

Larger tonsil stones may cause recurrent bad breath, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste in the back of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist in the back of the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.

== Pathophysiology ==

The mechanism by which these calculi form is subject to debate, though they appear to result from the accumulation of material retained within the crypts, along with the growth of bacteria and fungi—sometimes in association with persistent chronic purulent tonsillitis.

In 2009, an association between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept is the assumption that bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle layer, and acidification toward the core.

==Cause and diagnosis==

Diagnosis is usually made upon inspection. Tonsilloliths are difficult to diagnose in the absence of clear manifestations, and often constitute casual findings of routine radiological studies. The cause of tonsil stones can include a multitude of sources from bacterial infections, streptococcus bacteria, viral infections, adenoviruses, influenza virus, enteroviruses and parainfluenza virus.

===Classification===
Tonsilloliths or tonsil stones are calcifications that form in the crypts of the palatal tonsils. They are also known to form in the throat and on the roof of the mouth. Tonsils are filled with crevices where bacteria and other materials, including dead cells and mucus, can become trapped. When this occurs, the debris can become concentrated in white formations that occur in the pockets. Researchers found aerobic bacteria present on the surface of tonsilloliths and anaerobic bacteria at the core of tonsilloliths. They have the potential to cause oral halitosis as they contain volatile sulfur compounds and sulfur derived gases, foul smelling compounds produced during bacterial metabolism. Tonsilloliths are formed when this trapped debris accumulates and are expressed from the tonsil. They are generally soft, sometimes rubbery. This tends to occur most often in people who suffer from chronic inflammation in their tonsils or repeated bouts of tonsillitis. They are often associated with post-nasal drip.

===Enlarged tonsil stones===

Much rarer than the typical tonsil stones are giant tonsilloliths. Giant tonsilloliths may often be mistaken for other oral maladies, including peritonsillar abscess, and tumors of the tonsil. On average, tonsil stones should appear within a similar range of the image shown here; however, individuals with extenuating cases have been reported. In these instances, extensive care such as extraction by a licensed medical professional may be needed.

===Differential diagnosis===
Imaging diagnostic techniques can identify a radiopaque mass that may be mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. CT scan may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the tonsillar zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy, peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, phlebolites, ectopic bone or cartilage, lymph nodes, granulomatous lesions or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament in the context of Eagle syndrome (elongated styloid process).

Differential diagnosis of tonsilloliths includes foreign body, calcified granuloma, malignancy, an enlarged temporal styloid process or rarely, isolated bone which is usually derived from embryonic rests originating from the branchial arches.

==Treatment==
If tonsil stones do not bother a person, no treatment is needed. Otherwise gargling with saltwater and manual removal may be tried. Chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride may also be tried. Surgical treatment may include partial or complete tonsil removal.

Some people are able to remove tonsil stones using a cotton swab. Oral irrigators are also effective. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for tonsil stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly to the sink tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for tonsil stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at low-pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply manipulating the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user&#x27;s requirements.

There are also manually pressurized tonsil stone removers. A manual pump-type tonsil stone remover can adjust the water pressure depending on the number of pumps, effectively removing tonsil stones.

More simply still, gargling with warm, salty water may help alleviate the discomfort of tonsillitis, which often accompanies tonsil stones. Vigorous gargling each morning can also keep the tonsil crypts clear of all but the most persistent tonsilloliths.

===Curettage===
Larger tonsil stones may require removal by curettage (scooping) or otherwise, although thorough irrigation will still be required afterward to effectively wash out smaller pieces. Larger lesions may require local excision, although these treatments may not completely help the bad breath issues that are often associated with this condition.

===Laser===
Another option is to decrease the surface area (crypts, crevices, etc.) of the tonsils via laser resurfacing. The procedure is called a laser cryptolysis. It can be performed using a local anesthetic. A scanned carbon dioxide laser selectively vaporizes and smooths the surface of the tonsils. This technique flattens the edges of the crypts and crevices that collect the debris, preventing trapped material from forming stones.

===Surgery===
Tonsillectomy may be indicated if bad breath due to tonsillar stones persists despite other measures.

==Epidemiology==
Tonsilloliths or tonsillar concretions occur in up to 10% of the population, frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis. While small concretions in the tonsils are common, true stones are less so. They commonly occur in young adults and are rare in children.

<text>Robert Hibbert (25 October 1769 – 23 September 1849) was the founder of the Hibbert Trust.

==Biography==

The third and posthumous son of John Hibbert (1732–1769), a Jamaica merchant, and Janet, daughter of Samuel Gordon, he was born in Jamaica; hence he spoke of himself as a Creole. His mother died early.

Between 1784 and 1788, he was a pupil of Gilbert Wakefield at Nottingham. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1788, and graduated B.A. in 1791. At Cambridge he formed a lifelong friendship with William Frend, the social reformer.

At a later period (1800–01), when Wakefield was imprisoned in Dorchester for writing a political pamphlet, Hibbert, though not wealthy then, sent him £1,000. 

In 1791, Hibbert went to Kingston, Jamaica, as partner in a mercantile house (a trading partnership, Hibbert, Purrier and Horton) founded by his cousin Thomas (not to be confused with his father&#x27;s eldest brother, Thomas Hibbert). Another cousin, George Hibbert, son of another Robert Hibbert (1717-1784) was one of the principals of the West India Dock Company which instigated the construction of the docks of that name on London&#x27;s Isle of Dogs.

Returning to England in about 1803, he bought the estate of East Hide (now called Hyde), near Luton, Bedfordshire.

In Jamaica, he had acquired considerable property (in 1791 he purchased two sugar plantations, Georgia and Dundee, both in Hanover Parish) and he was not convinced by the arguments of Frend that his ownership of slaves was immoral. Besides plans for their material benefit, he sent out as a missionary to the negroes on his estates, in October 1817, Thomas Cooper (died 25 October 1880, aged 88). Cooper, a Unitarian minister recommended by Frend, remained on the island until 1821, endeavouring, with little success, to improve their moral and religious condition. A somewhat acrimonious controversy followed the publication of Cooper&#x27;s 1823 report, &quot;Negro slavery, or, A view of some of the more prominent features of that state of society :as it exists in the United States of America and in the colonies of the West Indies, especially in Jamaica.&quot;

After 1825, Hibbert&#x27;s Jamaica property declined in value and in about 1836 he sold it at considerable loss. He had previously (1833) sold his Bedfordshire estate and moved to London. He died at Welbeck Street, London, on 23 September 1849, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. While in Jamaica, he married Elizabeth Jane, daughter of John Nembhard, M.D., who died on 15 February 1853.

===Hibbert Trust===
On 19 July 1847, Hibbert executed a deed conveying to trustees $50,000 in 6% Ohio stock, and £8,000 in railway shares. The trustees, on the death of his widow, were to apply the income &#x27;in such manner as they shall from time to time deem most conducive to the spread of Christianity in its most simple and intelligible form, and to the unfettered exercise of the right of private judgment in matters of religion&#x27;. The trustees were always to be laymen. Appended was a scheme for the administration of the trust, which the trustees were empowered to revise, and were directed to revise at least once in every twenty-five years.

In the original scheme the trust was called &#x27;the Anti-trinitarian Fund&#x27;, and its object was, by a provision of divinity scholarships, to encourage learning and culture among unorthodox Christians. The breadth of the actual trust is largely due to the counsels of Hibbert&#x27;s solicitor, Edwin Wilkins Field, but, in opposition to Field, Hibbert &#x27;determined on insisting that all recipients should be hetero-dox&#x27;, his intention being &#x27;to elevate the position and the public influence of the unitarian ministry&#x27;.

In addition to scholarships and fellowships, the number and conditions of which are settled by the trustees from year to year, the trust, from the revision of 1878 until 1887, maintained an annual Hibbert Lecture, the first series being delivered by Professor Max Muller in 1878; between 1902 and 1968 it issued &quot;The Hibbert Journal&quot;, a quarterly magazine.

<doc id="1167116" wikidata="Q6842599" url="?curid=1167116" title="Midlothian campaign">
<text>The Midlothian campaign of 1878–80 was a series of foreign policy speeches given by William Gladstone, former leader of Britain&#x27;s Liberal Party. Organised by the Earl of Rosebery as a media event, it is often cited as the first modern political campaign. It also set the stage for Gladstone&#x27;s comeback as a politician. It takes its name from the Midlothian constituency in Scotland where Gladstone (who was of Scottish ancestry) successfully stood in the 1880 election.

Gladstone charged the Conservative government of his longstanding political enemy Benjamin Disraeli with financial incompetence, neglect of domestic legislation, and mismanagement of foreign affairs. He was able to enhance his reputation as a popular and down-to-earth politician (&quot;The People&#x27;s William&quot;) and cemented his pre-eminence as the most important politician within the Liberal Party.

The Midlothian campaign made it impossible to ignore Gladstone&#x27;s leadership claim both within the Liberal Party and for Queen Victoria. Furthermore, it created a momentum that carried the Liberals to power in the 1880 election.

==Gladstone&#x27;s personal situation in the Mid-1870s==
After six years of gonverment, the Liberal government led by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone came to an end when the Liberals suffered a heavy defeat in the general election of 1874. After a short transition period, Gladstone relinquished the leadership of the Liberal Party and subsequently became a mere backbencher in the British House of Commons. Subsequently, he had to suffer a painful defeat when the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 was introduced as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill by Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Campbell Tait, to limit what he perceived as the growing ritualism of Anglo-Catholicism and the Oxford Movement within the Church of England. The bill was supported by Queen Victoria and Gladstone&#x27;s longstanding political nemesis, Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who saw the bill purely in political terms. Gladstone, a high church Anglican whose sympathies were for separation of church and state, felt disgusted that the liturgy was made, as he saw it, &quot;a parliamentary football&quot; and introduced six resolutions when the bill came to the House of Commons. But on this he found himself out of step with his own party and had to back down when Disraeli put the weight of the government behind the bill. When the bill was passed, he retreated to his country mansion Hawarden Castle. In January 1875 he made good of his promise given years earlier and withdrew himself altogether from politics. Instead he spent his time at Hawarden with his studies of Homer. After his self-imposed exile, leadership of the Liberal party was shared by Lord Hartington, who led the Liberals in the House of Commons and Lord Granville, who was Leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords.

==The Bulgarian Uprising of 1876==
In 1875 the Eastern question came to the fore for the first time since the Crimean War. In July 1875 an insurgency against Ottoman rule broke out in Herzegovina, soon spreading over to Bosnia. Then at the end of April 1876 an insurgency had broken out in Bulgaria against Turkish rule. Military of the Ottoman Empire and irregular troops soon crushed the Bulgarian revolt, thereby committing brutal massacres and killing some 12,000 people.

To block Russia from filling the vacuum, Britain had strong ties with the crumbling Ottoman Empire, long branded as Sick man of Europe. For London, it was essential to support Ottoman Empire against further Russian expansion. With the return of the conservatives to power in 1874, Benjamin Disraeli became prime minister. This forms a landmark in British foreign policy, as it ended a period of isolation and non-intervention. Since 1865 the policy of both parties had been to abstain from Continental affairs. From the beginning, Disraeli put his special attention to foreign policy and introduced a Imperial conception of affairs.

==Extraparliamentary protest movements==
News of a series of atrocities by the Ottomans during their suppression of the Bulgarian April Uprising reached the British press, despite the strong censorship of the Turkish authorities. In June the newspaper &quot;Daily News&quot; published an account of atrocities committed by irregular troops and claimed that some twentythousand men, women and children had been slaughtered. British public reaction was generally one of dismay, fuelled by various other public prints. Sir Henry Elliot, british Ambassador at Constantinople since 1867, was strongly pro-Turk throughout his years in Constantinople. Additionally he suffered from poor health and was unable to pursue the allegations made of correspondents. All of this inclined Elliot to believe Turkish assurances. Although he was aware that the reports contained at least some truth, he toned down his reports to London.
The government of Benjamin Disraeli ignored the outrage at first and continued its policy of support for the Ottoman Empire, an ally in the Crimean War and a bulwark against possible Russian expansion in the area. Disraeli, who was pro-Turk himself, was instinctively sceptical about the horrifying stories published, a stance he already took during the Indian mutiny back in 1857/1858. All of this combined to cause him to shrug aside the matter when he was questioned in the House of Commons about the issue. He dismissed the reports as little more than &quot;coffee house babble&quot;.

Gladstone took up the issue slowly, at first appearing uninterested. By 1878 he was publishing articles in favour of ending British economic support for the Ottoman government in response.

==The constituency of Midlothian==
By this point, Gladstone was already planning his return to full-time politics. At Hawarden Castle, he was analysing Liberal wins at several by-elections. As Gladstone had never warmed to his current constituency in south-east London, he was now in search for a new constituency. There were two offers before him; first up Leeds, a constituency with more than 50.000 voters and a Liberal stronghold.

The other offer was the constituency of Edinburghshire, popularly known as Midlothian, in Scotland. Created in 1708, Midlothian was, compared to Leeds, just a tiny constituency with only 3620 voters. Nevertheless, Midlothian offered a sophisticated, metropolitan environment which were steeped in the tradition of the Scottish Enlightenment. Furthermore, it was a battleground for influence between two of the most powerful Scottish aristocratic families: The Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Rosebery were fighting for supremacy here since the 1860s. In 1868 the long Conservative supremacy had come to an end when the Liberals sponsored by the Earl of Rosebery had won in Midlothian; in 1874 Lord Dalkeith heir to the Duke of Buccleuch, had been able to win the seat back with a narrow majority for the Conservatives. Nevertheless, Rosebery convinced Gladstone that Midlothian was an ideal place to start his campaign. In the past, Scotland had become a stronghold for Liberalism.

Rosebery who was one of the richest landowners and married to Hannah de Rothschild, promised Gladstone that he would pay up for all arising costs.
Rosebery became Gladstone&#x27;s campaign manager.

==The campaign==
By 1880, Gladstone&#x27;s dogged focus on the issue had dragged it to the forefront of public attention, and in the general election of 1880, Gladstone toured a series of cities giving speeches of up to five hours on the subject. The nature of his orations has often been compared to that of sermons, and his fiery, emotive, but logically structured speeches are credited with swaying a large number of undecided voters to the Liberals in the 1880s, and ousting Disraeli&#x27;s last Conservative government.

Equally important to the large scale of attendance at these meetings (several thousand came to each, and given the relatively narrow scale of the franchise, this meant Gladstone could address a large proportion of electors in each district) was the widespread reporting of Gladstone&#x27;s speeches and the public reaction to them. Paul Brighton argues that it was a highly successful media event:
:What was new about Midlothian was not that Gladstone spoke from the platform. This was already common-place for many front-rank politicians. It was the fact that the campaign was effectively designed as a media event, with specific attention to the deadlines and operational requirements of the journalists covering it and crafted for maximum impact in the morning and evening papers.

==Content==
Gladstone&#x27;s speeches covered the entire range of national policy, he gave his large audiences an advanced course in the principles of government that was both magisterial and exciting. The major speeches constitute a statement of the Liberal philosophy of government, reinforced by the fervour of his own deeply-held Anglican faith. Scotland, at this time, was a nation fixated on the promotion of this sort of religious and moral rectitude and probity. His focus was usually on foreign affairs. Gladstone presented his commitment to a world community, governed by law, protecting the weak. His vision of the ideal world order combined universalism and inclusiveness; he appealed to group feeling, the sense of concern for others, rising eventually to the larger picture of the unity of mankind.

<doc id="1167123" wikidata="Q4680664" url="?curid=1167123" title="Adaptation to extrauterine life">
<text>At the end of pregnancy, the fetus must take the journey of childbirth to leave the reproductive mother. Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, the newborn must begin to adjust to life outside the uterus. This is true for all viviparous animals; this article discusses humans as the most-researched example.

The outside environment is a drastic change for the neonate, therefore the neonate must be assessed frequently and thoroughly. The Apgar scale is an assessment performed immediately following birth. It consists of the assessment of heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and generalized skin color. Apgar scoring is performed one minute and five minutes after birth. Scoring ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating severe neonatal distress and 10 indicating a smooth transition to extrauterine life.

Newborns transitioning into extrauterine life will undergo periods of reactivity. These periods are divided into three stages. The first stage occurs in the first 30 minutes of life; during this stage the infant is alert and responsive with heart rate peaking at 160-180 beats per minute and then stabilizes to a baseline rate of 100-120 beats per minute. Crackles upon auscultation and irregular respirations are a normal finding. In the second stage, there is a decrease in responsiveness and motor activity which is often manifested as sleep. This period can last from 1–2 hours. The third stage marks the second period of reactivity. This period can occur anywhere in the first 2 to 8 hours after birth and lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. Tachycardia and tachypnea may be present during brief periods. Passing of meconium also occurs.

==Cardiac==
Physiology: In utero, the placenta delivers oxygenated blood to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Upon delivery, the umbilical cord is cut. The cardiovascular system must now adapt. Blood CO2 rises because it is now not removed by the placenta. This is a powerful stimulus for the infant to start breathing. Breathing sharply increases O2 in the lungs, thus quickly reverting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction that had held the pulmonary vascular resistance high during the uterine life. Lung ventilation also extends the so far convoluted, shrunk pulmonary vessels, also contributing to the quick and marked drop in the pulmonary vascular resistance. As a result, much higher proportion of the right ventricle output flows into the pulmonary vessels than into the systemic circulation through the ductus arteriosus. 
The detachment of the placenta causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance, which leads to an increase in pressure gradient from the left atrium. The left atrium now has higher pressure than the right atrium causing the foramen ovale to close. Within the first 10 minutes of birth, blood begins to flow left-to-right through the ductus arteriosus. This causes a significant increase in output of the left ventricle and increase in stroke volume. Subsequently, calcium channel activity increases and potassium channel decreases furthering ductal constriction. Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs within the first 24 hours, with permanent closure following within 4 weeks. Lastly cardiac output increases to nearly double what it was in utero. 
All of these cardiovascular system changes result in the adaptation from fetal circulation patterns to an adult circulation pattern. During this transition, some types of congenital heart disease that were not symptomatic &quot;in utero&quot; during fetal circulation will present with cyanosis or respiratory signs.
Manifestations: When the newborn cries, there is a reversal of blood flow through the foramen ovale which causes the newborn to appear mildly cyanotic in the first few days of life. 
The heart rate of the newborn should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute and it is common for the heart rate to be irregular in the first few hours following birth. The heart sounds will have a variation in pitch, duration, and intensity than that of an adult. Blood pressure readings should range from 60 to 80 mm Hg systolic and 40–50 mm Hg diastolic. Mean arterial pressure should be the same as the weeks of gestation at birth. Within the first hour after birth, there may be a drop of up to 15 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure.

Delayed cord clamping is defined as waiting more than 2 minutes to clamp the newborn&#x27;s umbilical cord. This has been proven to be beneficial in improving hematocrit and iron while also decreasing anemia. These benefits can last up to 6 months for the newborn.

Assessments/Interventions: Assessment and monitoring of vital signs and skin color are important in detecting cardiovascular issues in the infant.
The apical pulse rate should be auscultated for one full minute when the newborn is calm or sleeping. Any irregular heart rate after the first few hours of life that is not related to crying or another outside factor should be monitored and evaluated.
Blood pressure will be taken with an appropriately sized cuff, preferably when the newborn is at rest. 
Consistent tachycardia should be evaluated for conditions such as anemia, hyperthermia, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Consistent bradycardia could be an indication of congenital heart block or hypoxemia. Pallor and central cyanosis (cyanosis in hands and feet is a common and normal finding) can also indicate cardiovascular issues.

==Ventilation and Oxygenation==
Physiology: Upon birth, the newborn&#x27;s lungs become the center for gas exchange. There are a variety of factors that influence newborn respiratory functions; these factors include chemical, mechanical, thermal, and sensory. Respirations begin when fetal aortic and carotid chemoreceptors are stimulated by the varying concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During vaginal birth, the newborn&#x27;s chest is compressed by the birth canal. Upon delivery, negative pressure allows air into the lungs. The first cries of the infant allow for alveoli expansion and absorption of fetal lung fluid. Temperature changes and other sensory stimulation contributes to respiratory function as well.

Manifestations: Breathing patterns are often irregular and shallow. The infants respiration rate should be between 30 and 60 breaths per minute with preference for nasal breathing. Ribs expands horizontally. Breath sounds should be clear and equal in both lungs. Abdominal breathing is normal. Acrocyanosis is a normal finding.

Assessments/Interventions: Suctioning of nasal and oral secretions promotes fluid clearance. Auscultation of lung sounds to assess for any abnormalities. Pulse oximetry is performed to determine oxygen saturation. Monitor signs of respiratory distress such as: nasal flaring, grunting, central cyanosis.

==Metabolic==
Physiology: At birth, the newborn is cut off from the mother&#x27;s glucose supply and will begin to rely on stored fat for energy. Glycogen stores are maximal at term. Within the first hour of life, blood glucose will typically reach its lowest point and then stabilize within 2 to 4 hours, hence breastfeeding is promoted immediately. In cases where feeding is delayed, the neonate can use lactate, free-fatty acids, and ketone bodies.

Manifestations: Normal blood glucose levels range from 40 to 50 mg/dl.
Rooting and sucking reflex should be present and the neonate will eat small amounts frequently. All vital signs should be within normal limits coinciding with the neonates presentation of calmness and satiation.

Assessments/Interventions: Monitor blood glucose level and encourage breastfeeding or formula feeding as early as possible. Lactation and breastfeeding education should be provided as appropriate.

==Temperature regulation==
Physiology: Newborns lack the ability of thermogenesis due to underdeveloped shivering mechanism. Body heat is lost through conduction, convection, and radiant heat. Thermoregulation is achieved through several methods: the metabolism of brown fat and Kangaroo care, also known as skin to skin. &quot;Brown fat&quot; is specialized adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria designed to rapidly oxidize fatty acids in order to generate metabolic heat. Skin to skin to care is the immediate placement of the neonate directly onto a caregiver&#x27;s bare chest. This promotes thermoregulation of the neonate through heat generated from caregiver.

Manifestations: Normal temperature ranges from . Cold infants may cry or appear restless. The neonates&#x27; arms and legs maintain a fetal position, lessening their body surface area and reducing heat loss.

Assessments/Interventions: Dry neonate immediately after birth and initiate skin-to-skin contact. Provide warm blankets and a hat. Utilize a radiant warmer if skin-to-skin is not appropriate. Frequently monitor axillary body temperature. Limit neonate&#x27;s exposure during diaper changes and assessments.

<text>Poocham is an unincorporated community in the town of Westmoreland in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States, near the larger communities of Keene, New Hampshire and Brattleboro, Vermont.

Poocham&#x27;s oldest houses date from around 1800. By reputation, the name &quot;Poocham&quot; comes from an Abenaki Indian word meaning &quot;gathering place&quot;. The community is almost entirely composed of homes and farms, but a small fluorite mine (called William Wise Mine) and growing vineyard (called Poocham Hill Winery) are also present.

<text>James Douglas Johnston (1817–1896) was an officer in the United States Navy, then served as a commander in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Johnston was born in Kentucky and was appointed from that state as a United States Navy Midshipman in 1832. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant in 1843 and had not received further promotion when he resigned from the service in April 1861. Johnston joined the Confederate States Navy in the same month as a First Lieutenant and was promoted to Commander in June 1864. His initial Confederate service was as a lighthouse inspector. He was assigned to the New Orleans Station in 1861 and to the forces on Mobile Bay, Alabama, later in that year.

Johnston commanded the ironclads CSS &quot;Baltic&quot; in 1861-63 and CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot; in 1864. He was captured with the latter ship during the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, and held as a prisoner of war until the following October. After he was exchanged, Commander Johnston returned to duty in the Mobile area, remaining there until the end of the U.S. Civil War in May 1865, when he surrendered and was paroled.

On 9 May 1896, he died in Savannah, Georgia.

<text>The League of Independent Workers of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is a union in the U.S. state of California.

==Founding==

Between 2002 and 2005, the cost of living in Livingston, California, increased substantially. In particular, house prices doubled and rents went up.

In 2003, workers at the Foster Farms poultry plants around Livingston voted to leave the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 1288.

In 2004, the workers organized the League and voted to be represented by it.

In 2005, the League negotiated with Foster Farms. The League proposed a union shop contract with substantial pay increases; Foster Farms proposed an open shop contract with nominal pay increases. The League affiliated with the International Association of Machinists. Foster Farms refused to recognize the League&#x27;s affiliation with the IAM. A three-day strike occurred in October 2005.

In 2006, Foster Farms and the League agreed to an open shop contract with nominal pay increases. The League&#x27;s members ratified the contract on October 29, 2006.

<text>&quot;Home Means Nevada&quot; is the state anthem of the U.S. state of Nevada. It was written by Bertha Raffetto in 1932 and officially adopted by the Nevada Legislature in 1933 as the official state song.

==Lyrics==

Way out in the land of the setting sun, &lt;br&gt;
Where the wind blows wild and free, &lt;br&gt;
There&#x27;s a lovely spot, just the only one &lt;br&gt;
That means home sweet home to me. &lt;br&gt;
If you follow the old Kit Carson trail, &lt;br&gt;
Until desert meets the hills, &lt;br&gt;
Oh you certainly will agree with me, &lt;br&gt;
It&#x27;s the land of a thousand thrills. &lt;br&gt;

Chorus: &lt;br&gt;
Home means Nevada, &lt;br&gt;
Home means the hills, &lt;br&gt;
Home means the sage and the pines. &lt;br&gt;
Out by the Truckee&#x27;s silvery rills, &lt;br&gt;
Out where the sun always shines, &lt;br&gt;
There is the land that I love the best,&lt;br&gt;
Fairer than all I can see. &lt;br&gt;
Right in the heart of the golden west &lt;br&gt;
Home, means Nevada to me. &lt;br&gt;

Whenever the sun at the close of day, &lt;br&gt;
Colors all the western sky, &lt;br&gt;
Oh my heart returns to the desert grey &lt;br&gt;
And the mountains tow&#x27;ring high. &lt;br&gt;
Where the moon beams play in shadowed glen, &lt;br&gt;
With the spotted fawn and doe, &lt;br&gt;
All the live long night until morning light, &lt;br&gt;
Is the loveliest place I know. &lt;br&gt;

Chorus &lt;br&gt;

Right in the heart of the golden west &lt;br&gt;
Home, means Nevada to me. &lt;br&gt;
==Notable performances==

<text>Marshall Leonard (born December 29, 1980, in El Paso, Texas) is an American soccer defender and midfielder, who last played for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.

Leonard is African American. He attended high school in Columbus, Georgia, earning varsity letters at both Shaw High School and Brookstone School. He went on to play college soccer at the University of Virginia from 1998 to 2001. Leonard played and started in a total of 89 games at UVA while scoring one goal and 8 assists.

Leonard was selected 45th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft, and signed to a developmental contract. After spending his first year entirely on the bench, Leonard came on strong at the end of 2003, appearing in ten games, including five starts. He developed into a consistent starter in 2004, and when Joe Franchino went down with an injury, Leonard took his spot at left back; he finished the year with one assist in 22 starts. In 2005, while playing most of the year at the left wing spot, he scored a goal and an assist. He was waived by New England in 2007.

Following his retirement from soccer, Leonard graduated from the Stony Brook School of Medicine in 2016. He later completed his residency in emergency medicine at Stony Brook University Hospital in 2019.

<doc id="1167163" wikidata="Q4816314" url="?curid=1167163" title="Atlantic Bowl">
<text>The Atlantic Bowl was one of the two national semifinal men&#x27;s football games of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now known as U Sports). The winner of the Atlantic Bowl would meet the winner of the Churchill Bowl for the Vanier Cup. It was replaced by the Uteck Bowl in 2001 following the death of Larry Uteck, a former athletic director at Saint Mary&#x27;s University.

==History==
The Atlantic Bowl was traditionally a match between the champions of Atlantic University Sport (and its various predecessors) and a conference-winning team from central Canada. It had been hosted in Halifax, Nova Scotia annually since 1956, often at Huskies Stadium, home to the Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies. There were exceptions to Halifax as the host city. In 1976, the Acadia Axemen hosted the game at Raymond Field. The second was in 1983 when the game was scheduled to be hosted by the Canada West champion. The AUAA withdrew from national competition and participation in the game due to the relocation from Halifax. As a result, the Calgary Dinos advanced to the Vanier Cup by virtue of their Hardy Trophy win over UBC.

The Atlantic Bowl champions would receive the Robert L. Stanfield trophy, a trophy named after the former leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Official Opposition.

Traditionally, the winners of Atlantic University Sport would face one of the other three conference champions, with the other two meeting in the Churchill Bowl.

<doc id="1167164" wikidata="Q420058" url="?curid=1167164" title="Transient tachypnea of the newborn">
<text>Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a respiratory problem that can be seen in the newborn shortly after delivery. It is caused by retained fetal lung fluid due to impaired clearance mechanisms. It is the most common cause of respiratory distress in term neonates. It consists of a period of tachypnea (rapid breathing, higher than the normal range of 30–60 times per minute). Usually, this condition resolves over 24–72 hours. Treatment is supportive and may include supplemental oxygen and antibiotics. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation of the lungs including prominent pulmonary vascular markings, flattening of the diaphragm, and fluid in the horizontal fissure of the right lung.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of transient tachypnea of the newborn include respiratory distress and rapid breathing (tachypnea). This condition usually occurs within the first two hours of birth in full term and late term newborn infants.

==Pathophysiology==
Due to the higher incidence of transient tachypnea of the newborn in infants delivered by caesarean section, it has been postulated that it could result from a delayed absorption of fetal lung fluid from the pulmonary lymphatic system. The increased fluid in the lungs leads to increased airway resistance and reduced lung compliance. It is thought this could be from lower levels of circulating catecholamines after a caesarean section, which are believed to be necessary to alter the function of the ENaC channel to absorb excess fluid from the lungs. Pulmonary immaturity has also been proposed as a causative factor. Levels of phosphatidylglycerol (an indicator of lung maturity) were found to be negative in certain newborns. Mild deficiency of pulmonary surfactant has also been suggested as a causative factor.

==Diagnosis==
Transient tachypnea usually occurs in term neonates and has normal to slightly increased lung volumes with perihilar linear densities from fissural fluid, with a characteristic prominent line in the horizontal fissure of the right lung. Pleural effusions can also develop, which are also seen with meconium aspiration but not with respiratory distress syndrome. The lungs may also appear hyperinflated. It is a diagnosis of exclusion as it is a benign condition that can have symptoms and signs similar to more serious syndromes, such as respiratory distress or meconium aspiration. 

In distinction to transient tachypnea, respiratory distress syndrome is more common in premature infants. It is characterized by symmetric fine granular opacities, air bronchograms. It does not have pleural effusions because the lung dysfunction is not due to excess fluid (as can occur with a non-compressive Cesaerean section), but decreased surfactant, causing the lungs to be inelastic and crumpled. 

Meconium aspiration presents as a neonate with a prolonged delivery and meconium stained amniotic fluid, with decreased lung volumes and ropy perihilar opacities that represent the aspirated meconium on imaging.

== Treatment ==
Supportive care is the treatment of choice for transient tachypnea of the newborn. This may include withholding oral feeding in periods of extreme tachypnea (over 60 breaths per minute) to prevent aspiration, supplemental oxygen, and CPAP. Evidence from clinical trials investigating the use of postnatal corticosteroids for transient tachypnea of the newborn is inconclusive. Similarly, the clinical trial evidence investigating non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) compared to supplemental oxygen is uncertain. Epinephrine or salbutamol (albuterol) have been suggested as a treatment option for transient tachypnea, as a result of evidence that β-agonists increase the speed of alveolar fluid clearance in the lung of newborns. However, the safety and effectiveness of these treatment approaches is not clear.

== Prognosis ==
Transient tachypnea of the newborn is usually self-limiting. However, it may be associated with wheezing syndromes as the child grows older.

== Epidemiology ==
Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs in approximately 1 in 100 preterm infants and 3.6–5.7 per 1000 term infants. It is most common in infants born by caesarian section without a trial of labor after 35 weeks of gestation. Male infants and infants with an umbilical cord prolapse or perinatal asphyxia are at higher risk. Parental risk factors include use of pain control or anesthesia during labor, asthma, and diabetes.

<doc id="1167172" wikidata="Q52725080" url="?curid=1167172" title="Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II">
<text>The sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II is a 6th-century BC sarcophagus unearthed in 1855 in the grounds of an ancient necropolis southeast of the city of Sidon, in modern-day Lebanon, that contained the body of Eshmunazar II (Phoenician: , ), Phoenician King of Sidon. One of only three Ancient Egyptian sarcophagi found outside Egypt, with the other two belonging to Eshmunazar&#x27;s father King Tabnit and to a woman, possibly Eshmunazar&#x27;s mother Queen Amoashtart, it was likely carved in Egypt from local amphibolite, and captured as booty by the Sidonians during their participation in Cambyses II&#x27;s conquest of Egypt in 525 BC. The sarcophagus has two sets of Phoenician inscriptions, one on its lid and a partial copy of it on the sarcophagus trough, around the curvature of the head. The lid inscription was of great significance upon its discovery as it was the first Phoenician language inscription to be discovered in Phoenicia proper and the most detailed Phoenician text ever found anywhere up to that point, and is today the second longest extant Phoenician inscription, after the Karatepe bilingual.

The sarcophagus was discovered by Alphonse Durighello, a diplomatic agent in Sidon engaged by Aimé Péretié, the chancellor of the French consulate in Beirut. The sarcophagus was sold to Honoré de Luynes, a wealthy French nobleman and scholar, and was subsequently removed to the Louvre after the resolution of a legal dispute over its ownership.

More than a dozen scholars across Europe and the United States rushed to translate the sarcophagus inscriptions after its discovery, many noting the similarities between the Phoenician language and Hebrew. The translation allowed scholars to identify the king buried inside, his lineage, and his construction feats. The inscriptions warn against disturbing Eshmunazar II&#x27;s place of repose; it also recounts that the &quot;Lord of Kings&quot;, the Achaemenid king, granted Eshmunazar II the territories of Dor, Joppa, and Dagon in recognition for his services.

The discovery led to great enthusiasm for archaeological research in the region and was the primary reason for Renan&#x27;s 1860–1861 , the first major archaeological mission to Lebanon and Syria. Today, it remains one of the highlights of the Louvre&#x27;s Phoenician collection.

== Eshmunazar II ==

Eshmunazar II (Phoenician: , a theophoric name meaning &#x27;Eshmun helps&#x27;) was the Phoenician King of Sidon, reigning to . He was the grandson of King Eshmunazar I and a vassal king of the Achaemenid Empire. Eshmunazar II succeeded his father, Tabnit I, on the throne of Sidon. Tabnit I ruled briefly before his death, and his sister-wife, Amoashtart, acted as an interregnum regent until the birth of Eshmunazar II. Amoashtart then ruled as Eshmunazar II&#x27;s regent until he reached adulthood. Eshmunazar II, however, died prematurely at age 14 during the reign of Cambyses II of Achaemenid Persia, and was succeeded by his cousin Bodashtart. Eshmunazar II, like his mother, father and grandfather, was a priest of Astarte. Temple building and religious activities were important for the Sidonian kings to demonstrate their piety and political power. Eshmunazar II and his mother, Queen Amoashtart, constructed new temples and religious buildings dedicated to Phoenician gods such as Baal, Astarte, and Eshmun.

== History ==

=== Phoenician funerary practices ===
The Phoenicians emerged as a distinct culture on the Levantine coast in the Late Bronze Age () as one of the successor cultures to the Canaanites. They were organized into independent city-states that shared a common language, culture, and religious practices. They had, however, diverse mortuary practices, including inhumation and cremation.

Archaeological evidence of elite Achaemenid period burials abounds in the hinterland of Sidon. These include inhumations in underground vaults, rock-cut niches, and shaft and chamber tombs in Sarepta, Ain al-Hilweh, Ayaa, Magharet Abloun, and the Temple of Eshmun in Bustan el-Sheikh. Elite Phoenician burials were characterized by the use of sarcophagi, and a consistent emphasis on the integrity of the tomb. Surviving mortuary inscriptions from that period invoke deities to assist with the procurement of blessings, and to conjure curses and calamities on whoever desecrated the tomb.

The first record of the discovery of an ancient necropolis in Sidon was made in 1816 by English explorer and Egyptologist William John Bankes.

=== Modern discovery ===
The sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II was discovered on 19 January 1855 by the workmen of Alphonse Durighello, an agent of the French consulate in Sidon hired by Aimé Péretié, an amateur archaeologist and the chancellor of the French consulate in Beirut. Durighello&#x27;s men were digging on the plains southeast of the city of Sidon in the grounds of an ancient necropolis (dubbed by French Semitic philologist and biblical scholar Ernest Renan). The sarcophagus was found outside a hollowed-out rocky mound that was known to locals as Magharet Abloun (&#x27;the Cavern of Apollo&#x27;). It had originally been protected by a vault, of which some stones remained in place. One tooth, a piece of bone, and a human jaw were found in the rubble during the sarcophagus extraction, showing that the remains of Eshmunazar II had been robbed in antiquity.

Cornelius Van Alen Van Dyck, an American missionary physician, made it to the scene and made a transcript of the inscription which was first published on 11 February 1855 in &quot;The United States Magazine&quot;.

On 20 February 1855, Durighello informed Péretié of the find. Durighello had taken advantage of the absence of laws governing archaeological excavation and the disposition of the finds under the Ottoman rule, and had been involved in the lucrative business of trafficking archaeological artifacts. Under the Ottomans, it sufficed to either own the land or to have the owner&#x27;s permission to excavate. Any finds resulting from digs became the property of the finder. To excavate, Durighello had bought the exclusive right from the land owner, the Mufti of Sidon, Mustapha Effendi.

=== Ownership dispute ===

Durighello&#x27;s ownership of the sarcophagus was contested by the British vice-consul general in Syria, Habib Abela, who claimed he had entered into agreements with the workers and the landowner to assign and sell him the rights to any discoveries. The matter quickly took a political turn; in a letter dated 21 April 1855 the director of the French national museums, Count Émilien de Nieuwerkerke, requested the intervention of Édouard Thouvenel, the French ambassador to the Ottomans, stating that &quot;It is in the best interest of the museum to possess the sarcophagus as it adds a new value at a time in which we start studying with great zeal Oriental antiquities, until now unknown in most of Europe.&quot; A commission was appointed by the governor of the Sidon Eyalet, Wamik Pasha, to look into the case, and, according to the minutes of the meeting dated 24 April 1855, the dispute resolution was transferred to a commission of European residents that unanimously voted in favor of Durighello.

&quot;The United States Magazine&quot; reported on the issue of the legal dispute:

Péretié purchased the sarcophagus from Durighello and sold it to wealthy French nobleman and scholar Honoré de Luynes for . De Luynes donated the sarcophagus to the French government to be exhibited in the Louvre.

=== Removal to the Louvre ===
Péretié rushed the sarcophagus&#x27; laborious transportation to France. The bureaucratic task of removing the sarcophagus to France was facilitated with the intervention of Ferdinand de Lesseps, then the French consul general in Alexandria, and the French minister of education and religious affairs, Hippolyte Fortoul. During the transportation to the Sidon port, the citizens and the governor of Sidon gathered, escorted, and applauded the convoy; they adorned the sarcophagus with flowers and palm branches while 20 oxen, assisted by French sailors, dragged the carriage to the port. At the wharf, the crew of the French navy corvette loaded the sarcophagus&#x27; trough, and then its lid, onto a barge, before lifting it to the ship. The commander of , Delmas De La Perugia, read an early translation of the inscriptions, explaining the scientific importance and historical significance of the cargo to his crew.

The sarcophagus of King Eshmunazar II is housed in the Louvre&#x27;s Near Eastern antiquities section in room 311 of the Sully wing. It was given the museum identification number of AO 4806.

== Description ==
The Egyptian -style sarcophagus dates to the 6th century BC and is made of a solid, well polished block of bluish-black amphibolite. It measures long, wide, and high.

The lid displays a relief carving of the figure of a deceased person in the style of Egyptian mummy sarcophagi. The effigy of the deceased is portrayed smiling, wrapped up to the neck in a thick shroud, leaving the head uncovered. The effigy is dressed with a large Nubian wig, a false braided beard, and a usekh collar ending with falcon heads at each of its extremities, as is often seen at the neck of Egyptian mummies.

Two other sarcophagi of the same style were also unearthed in the necropolis.

=== Inscriptions ===

The Egyptian-style sarcophagus has no hieroglyphs; however, there are Phoenician inscriptions on its lid and trough. De Luynes and American philologist William Wadden Turner believed that the inscriptions were traced directly on the stone free-hand without the use of typographic guides for letter-spacing, and that these tracings were followed by the carving artisan.

The inscriptions of the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar are known to scholars as CIS I 3 and KAI 14; they are written in the Phoenician language and alphabet. They identify the king buried inside, tell of his lineage and temple construction feats, and warn against disturbing his repose. The inscriptions also state that the &quot;Lord of Kings&quot; (the Achaemenid King of Kings) granted the Sidonian king &quot;Dor and Joppa, the mighty lands of Dagon, which are in the plain of Sharon&quot; in recognition of his deeds. According to Scottish biblical scholar John Gibson the text &quot;offers an unusually high proportion of literary parallels with the Hebrew Bible, especially its poetic sections&quot;. French orientalist Jean-Joseph-Léandre Bargès wrote that the language is &quot;identical with Hebrew, except for the final inflections of a few words and certain expressions.&quot;

As in other Phoenician inscriptions, the text seems to use no, or hardly any, &quot;matres lectionis&quot;, the letters that indicate vowels in Semitic languages. As in Aramaic, the preposition () is used as an accusative marker, while () is used for &#x27;with&#x27;.

==== Lid inscription ====
The lid inscription consists of 22 lines of 40 to 55 letters each; it occupies a square situated under the sarcophagus&#x27; usekh collar and measures in length and width. As is customary for Phoenician writing, all the characters are written without spaces separating each word, except for a space in the 13th line, which divides the text into two equal parts. The lid letters are not evenly spaced, ranging from no distance to a spacing of . The lines of the text are neither straight nor evenly spaced. The letters in the lower part of the text (after the lacuna on line 13) are neater and smaller than the letters in the first part of the inscription. The letters of the first three lines of the lid inscription are cut deeper and rougher than the rest of the text which indicates that the engraver was either replaced or made to work more neatly.

==== Trough inscriptions ====
A copy of the first part (twelve and a half lines) of the lid inscription is carved delicately and uniformly on six lines around the head curvature on the trough of the sarcophagus, with the letters corresponding in size and style to the second part of the lid inscription. An unfinished seventh line matches the first nine characters that form the beginning of the text that begins after the lacuna on the 13th line of the lid inscription. It measures in width, significantly wider than the lid inscription.

The relationship between the trough and the lid inscription has been discussed amongst scholars. Turner believed that the similarity of the trough&#x27;s characters to those of Part II of the lid inscription suggested that the trough was inscribed immediately after the completion of the lid. Turner speculated that this may have been to claim both parts of the sarcophagus as Eshmunazar&#x27;s property, and suggested that the original intention was to copy the whole of the lid inscription, but after the copy of Part II had started, it was concluded that the ornamental line which runs round the outside of the sarcophagus would have divided the inscription in an unattractive manner. Turner&#x27;s theory was in contrast to German theologian Heinrich Ewald&#x27;s earlier proposal that originally the entire inscription had been intended to be engraved around the trough, to represent it as proceeding from his mouth, but error(s) made in the writing caused it to be abandoned, and the inscription started again on the lid.

The external surface of the trough bears also an isolated group of two Phoenician characters. De Luynes believes that they may have been trial carving marks made by the engraver.

==== Translations ====
Copies of the sarcophagus inscriptions were sent to scholars across the world, and translations were published by well-known scholars (see below table). Several other scholars worked on the translation, including the polymath Josiah Willard Gibbs, Hebrew language scholar William Henry Green, Biblical scholars James Murdock and Williams Jenks, and Syriac language expert Christian Frederic Crusé. American missionaries William McClure Thomson and Eli Smith who were living in Ottoman Syria at the time of the discovery of the sarcophagus successfully translated most of the text by early 1855, but did not produce any publications.

Belgian semitist Jean-Claude Haelewyck provided a hypothetical vocalization of the Phoenician text. A definitive vocalization is not possible because Phoenician is written without &quot;matres lectionis&quot;. Haelewyck based the premise of his vocalization on the affinity of the Phoenician and Hebrew languages, historical grammar, and ancient transcriptions.

A list of early published translations follows below:
==== English translation of the lid inscription ====
== Dating and attribution ==
The sarcophagus, along with two others found at the nearby Royal Necropolis of Ayaʿa, are considered the only Egyptian sarcophagi that have ever been found outside of Egypt. Marie-Louise Buhl&#x27;s monograph &quot;The late Egyptian anthropoid stone sarcophagi&quot; confirmed the sarcophagus as belonging to the 26th dynasty, which began in 664 BC and ended with Cambyses II&#x27;s conquest of Egypt in 525 BC – many centuries after the last of the known Egyptian Stelae in the Levant. These three Egyptian sarcophagi are considered to have contained the bodies of the same family – i.e. Eshmunazar II and his parents Tabnit and Amoashtart. Whereas Tabnit&#x27;s sarcophagus reemployed a sarcophagus already dedicated on its front with a long Egyptian inscription in the name of an Egyptian general, and Amoashtart&#x27;s was uninscribed, the sarcophagus used for Eshmunazar II was new and was inscribed with a full-length dedication in Phoenician on a clean surface. According to French archaeologist and epigrapher René Dussaud, the sarcophagi and their inscriptions may have been ordered by Amoashtart.

Scholars believe these sarcophagi were originally made in Egypt for members of the Ancient Egyptian elite, but were then transported to Sidon and repurposed for the burial of Sidonian royalty. Gibson and later scholars believe that the sarcophagi were captured as booty by the Sidonians during their participation in Cambyses II&#x27;s conquest. Herodotus recounts an event in which Cambyses II &quot;ransacked a burial ground at Memphis, where coffins were opened up and the dead bodies they contained were examined&quot;, possibly providing the occasion on which the sarcophagi were removed and reappropriated by his Sidonian subjects.

== Significance ==
The discovery of the Magharet Abloun hypogeum and of Eshmunazar II&#x27;s sarcophagus caused a sensation in France, which led Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, to dispatch a scientific mission to Lebanon headed by Ernest Renan.

=== Significance of the inscription ===
The lid inscription was of great significance upon its discovery; it was the first Phoenician-language inscription to be discovered in Phoenicia proper. Furthermore, this engraving forms the longest and most detailed Phoenician inscription ever found anywhere up to that point, and is now the second longest extant Phoenician inscription after the Karatepe bilingual.

Due to its length and level of preservation, the inscription offers valuable knowledge about the characteristics of the Phoenician language and, more specifically, of the Tyro-Sidonian dialect. Additionally, the inscription displays notable similarities to texts in other Semitic languages, evident in its idiomatic expressions, word combinations, and the use of repetition.

===Stylistic impact on later Phoenician sarcophagi===
The sarcophagi of Tabnit and Eshmunazar may have served as a model for the later sarcophagi of Sidon. After Tabnit and Eshmunazar II, sarcophagi continued to be used by Phoenician dignitaries, but with marked stylistic evolutions. These local anthropoid sarcophagi, built from the 5th century BC to the first half of the 4th century BC, continued to be carved in the form of a smooth, shapeless body, but used white marble, and the faces were progressively sculpted in more realistic Hellenic styles. It is uncertain whether they were imported from Greece or produced locally. This type of Phoenician sarcophagi has been found in the ruins of Phoenician colonies throughout the Mediterranean.

<text>Cosmo&#x27;s Cosmic Adventure: Forbidden Planet is a video game programmed by Todd Replogle and published by Apogee Software. It is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game. The game was released in mid March 1992 for MS-DOS compatible systems.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Cosmo, and the objective is to reach the exit of each level. Cosmo can walk and jump, and can hang onto most walls with his suction-cup hands. Combining the hanging and jumps allows Cosmo to climb to higher places. There are some interactive objects, including pushable ceiling buttons, teleporters, and springs that make Cosmo jump higher. There are also hovercraft (floating pads that allow Cosmo to fly) and hint globes (which cause a message to be displayed if Cosmo runs into one; destroying one with a bomb earns 12,800 points). The player has access to bonus levels after each level if enough stars are collected.

Cosmo has a health meter with three units. Each time an enemy or hazard damages Cosmo, he loses one unit of health. If he takes further damage after losing all health units, or falls off a chasm, the player restarts the level. Cosmo has unlimited lives. There are power-up modules that restore one health unit each. There are also two hidden cheeseburgers in each episode. Picking one up earns Cosmo an additional empty health unit, allowing Cosmo&#x27;s health meter to reach a maximum of five units. Enemies hurt Cosmo by touching him or firing projectiles at him. Cosmo can kill many of them by jumping on them. Bombs can also be collected and used to destroy enemies. Cosmo can carry at most 9 bombs at a time. After Cosmo drops a bomb, it takes a few seconds to explode, and it can hurt Cosmo if he is too close. Bombs can also be used to destroy other objects and hazards. Shield cubes, once collected, provide a temporary invincibility shield for Cosmo.

==Plot==
The storyline is about a little alien boy named &quot;Cosmo&quot;. Cosmo&#x27;s parents are taking him to Walt Disney World for his birthday. A comet hits their ship, forcing them to land on an unknown planet (called Zonk in WIP) and repair the ship. Cosmo goes exploring, and when he returns, his parents are missing. Seeing large footprints, Cosmo thinks that his parents have been captured and sets off to rescue them before they are eaten. There are three episodes in the game series in which Cosmo must navigate through 10 alien-themed levels for each episode.

At the end of the first episode, Cosmo unexpectedly gets swallowed by a large creature. The story continues in the second episode, where Cosmo ends up in the creature&#x27;s body and has to find a way out. At the end of the second episode, Cosmo finds the city where he thinks his parents might have been taken. In the final episode, Cosmo finds his parents (who were in no danger of being eaten the whole time) and has a great time at Disney World for his birthday.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s working titles were &quot;The Adventures of Zonk&quot; and &quot;Cosmo Kid from Space&quot;, but Stephen Hornback ultimately gave it the final name. It was developed by two people in seven months.

&quot;Cosmo&quot; uses 16-color EGA graphics at 320×200 screen resolution. The game uses three-layer, horizontal, parallax scrolling. A file contained with the shareware version of the game urged people not to download it if their computers could not handle it. The game was written with 24,500 lines of code. The game supports AdLib music, but sound effects are generated by the PC speaker.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Cosmic Adventure&quot; was &quot;especially playable and extremely addicting&quot;, and that fans of &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and side-scrolling platform games &quot;will find &quot;Cosmo&quot; much to their liking ... hours of pleasure without excessive destruction&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1993 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #197 by Sandy Petersen in the first &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

<text>Eric Quill (born February 28, 1978, in Missouri City, Texas) is an American soccer coach and former player. He is currently the head coach at Major League Soccer side FC Dallas.

==Career==

===College===
An outstanding youth soccer player, Quill was offered a contract by Ajax Amsterdam as a teenager, but declined the opportunity to go to Europe. He instead stayed in the United States, following the conventional route by going to Clemson University to play college soccer in 1996. After scoring six goals and five assists as a freshman for the Tigers, however, Quill decided to go pro, signing a Project-40 contract with MLS.

===Professional===
Quill was allocated to the Tampa Bay Mutiny for the 1997 season, but saw little playing time. After appearing extensively as a substitute in 1999, Quill finally broke into the team&#x27;s starting lineup in 2000, when he started 25 games, registering five goals and eleven assists. Quill returned and played just as well in 2001, finishing the year with two goals and eight assists in 23 starts. The Mutiny were contracted at the end of 2001, however, and Quill was selected fourth overall by the Kansas City Wizards in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft.

Quill immediately stepped into the Wizards&#x27; left midfield position, but numerous injuries limited him to 13 starts and one assist on the season. Having recovered in 2003, Quill had a solid campaign, starting 25 games and scoring three goals and seven assists. However, Quill was traded in the offseason to the Dallas Burn along with Carey Talley for Shavar Thomas. Quill had a disappointing season with the Burn, and although he beat out Brad Davis for his left midfield position, he only registered one goal and three assists on the year. He was let go by the club early in 2005 and signed with the MetroStars in August. Quill was released by the club in November 2005.

Unable to find a club, Quill turned to coaching, spending time as the assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with the women&#x27;s soccer team at the University of Houston in 2007 and 2008.

In early 2009, Quill was coaxed out of semi-retirement to play in the Premier Development League for Houston Leones, where he was expected to lend his experience to the team&#x27;s midfield.

===International===
Although he had been called up to camps, Quill never played for the United States national team. He did, however, play for the U-23, U-20, and U-16 sides.

===Coaching===
Quill&#x27;s first head coaching position was for North Texas SC during the club&#x27;s tenure in USL League One. North Texas won the league during the inaugural 2019 season, and Quill has named League One Coach of the Year.

In December 2021, Quill was named to Caleb Porter&#x27;s Columbus Crew coaching staff.

Quill was appointed head coach of New Mexico United in the USL Championship on June 13, 2023. In August 2024, New Mexico United extended Quill&#x27;s contract through the 2026 season. Quill led New Mexico to their best-ever single season performance in 2024, including a Western Conference title and team single-season records in wins and points.

Quill was named head coach of Major League Soccer club FC Dallas on November 20, 2024.

==Personal life==
Quill is married to Susan Bush, former soccer player for the U.S. national team and current coach, who he worked with while the assistant of the Houston Cougars women&#x27;s team.

<text>The painted apple moth (&quot;Teia anartoides&quot;) is a tussock moth native to Australia. It is notable as a pest in pine forests, and is classified as a pest in New Zealand. Some sources still refer to this species as belonging to the genus &quot;Orgyia&quot;, but in 2015 the genus &quot;Teia&quot; was recognized as a separate lineage.

In New Zealand, controversy over an aerial spraying programme arose when an outbreak of the moth was identified in Auckland.

<text>The Enemy Below is a 1957 American DeLuxe Color war film in CinemaScope about a battle between an American destroyer escort and a German U-boat during World War II. It stars Robert Mitchum and Curd Jürgens as the American and German commanding officers, respectively. Produced and directed by Dick Powell, the film was based on the 1956 novel of the same name by Denys Rayner, a British naval officer involved in antisubmarine warfare throughout the Battle of the Atlantic.

==Plot==
It is some time in the middle of World War II. The American USS &quot;Haynes&quot; is on patrol in the South Atlantic. Lieutenant Commander Murrell, a former Third Mate in the Merchant Marine and now an active-duty officer in the Naval Reserve, has recently taken command of the ship; he joined the Navy after his freighter was sunk by a German U-boat, and is still recovering from injuries incurred in the sinking of his previous Navy warship and 21 days marooned adrift afterwards.

Before the U-boat is first spotted, one sailor questions the new captain&#x27;s fitness and ability. Once a skilled game of cat-and-mouse tracking the U-boat gives way to a series of even more finely honed and intuitive attacks, the crew falls in strongly behind their new skipper.

Murrell is matching deadly wits with U-boat &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; von Stolberg, a wily former World War I &quot;Unterseeboot&quot; skipper deep into a conflict he resents for a Nazi regime he detests. As the battle that emerges tests both commanders and their crews, each man grows to respect his opponent as he discovers his rival can read his mind.

Murrell stalks the U-boat and subjects von Stolberg and his crew to hourly depth-charge attacks, trying to force him to surface where his ship is more vulnerable. In the end, von Stolberg takes advantage of Murrell&#x27;s predictable pattern of attacks and succeeds in torpedoing the &quot;Haynes&quot;. Although the &quot;Haynes&quot; is fatally wounded, it is still battle capable, and Murrell orders his men to set fires on the deck to make the damage look worse than it actually is, then to abandon ship; he retains only a skeleton crew to man the bridge, engine room, and one of his ship&#x27;s guns. He orders his gun crew to fire at the first opportunity at the U-boat&#x27;s stern to immobilize it, and then at its deck gun. As Murrell had hoped, von Stolberg falls for the gambit and surfaces to fire another torpedo to finish the &quot;Haynes&quot; off. Before he can, Murrell rams the U-boat, with the bow of the &quot;Haynes&quot; riding up over its foredeck and becoming stuck. With his own vessel now foundering, von Stolberg orders his crew to set explosive scuttling charges and abandon ship, putting the &quot;Haynes&quot; in further peril.

Murrell, the last man aboard, is about to join his crew in the lifeboats when he spots von Stolberg standing on the conning tower of the U-boat. He refuses to abandon his injured executive officer &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Heinie Schwaffer, who has been with him since &quot;academy days&quot;. Murrell tosses a line to the submarine and rescues the pair. Schwaffer clearly is dying, but von Stolberg still will not leave his comrade behind. Lieutenant Ware returns in the captain&#x27;s gig with a mixed party of American and German sailors, who race up the cargo nets to save the last survivors before the tangled vessels go up together in a conflagration.

Later, both crews are aboard a U.S. Navy vessel as German seamen ceremonially give Schwaffer a burial at sea, with the &quot;Haynes&quot; crew respectfully attending. Murrell and von Stolberg then share a moment at the stern, Murrell offering von Stolberg a cigarette as an olive branch. Von Stolberg, bitter about losing his ship, over losing his good friend, and about what has become of his country, says &quot;I should have died a dozen times over, Captain. This time, it was your fault.&quot; Murrell says &quot;Fine, next time I won&#x27;t throw you the rope.&quot; Von Stolberg chides back amicably, &quot;Oh, I think you will.&quot;

== Cast ==
* Robert Mitchum as Captain Murrell
* Curd Jürgens as &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; von Stolberg
* Theodore Bikel as &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; &quot;Heinie&quot; Schwaffer, von Stolberg&#x27;s second in command
* David Hedison as Lieutenant Ware, the executive officer of &quot;Haynes&quot; (as Al Hedison)

==Production==
===Writing===
The screenplay, which was adapted by Wendell Mayes, differs substantially from the original book. In the novel, the ship is British, but in the film, it is American. The screenplay&#x27;s final scenes of mutual respect between the protagonists are not taken from the book. In the book, the destroyer captain takes a swing at the U-boat captain while they are in the lifeboat because the U-boat captain claims that the destroyer crewmen are his prisoners. The film also alludes to evil in man (as personified by a concept such as the &quot;devil&quot;) being the real &quot;enemy&quot; (&quot;You cut off one head and it grows another...&quot;), the force within that drives one man against another, or even against himself.

The screenplay has historical precedence. On 6 May 1944, , which was the lead ship of the same destroyer escort class portrayed in &quot;The Enemy Below&quot;, actually rammed and sank a U-boat in combat before capturing many of the German crew.

===Casting===
The anti-Nazi U-boat captain was portrayed by actor Curd Jürgens, who had been an actual critic of Nazism in his native Germany. In 1944, after filming &quot;Wiener Mädeln&quot;, he got into an argument with Robert Kaltenbrunner (brother of high-ranking Austrian SS official Ernst Kaltenbrunner), SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny, and a member of Baldur von Schirach&#x27;s staff in a Viennese bar without knowing who they were. Jürgens was arrested and sent to a labor camp for the &quot;politically unreliable&quot; in Hungary. After a few weeks, he managed to escape and went into hiding. Jürgens became an Austrian citizen after the war.

The destroyer escort USS &quot;Haynes&quot; (DE-181) was represented in the film by the , provided by the US Navy in Pearl Harbor. Many of the actual ship&#x27;s crew appear in the film, such as the phone talkers, the gun and depth charge crews, and all of the men seen abandoning ship. The &quot;Whitehurst&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Walter Smith, played the engineering officer. He is the man seen reading comics (&quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;) during the lull before the action while an enlisted man is reading &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. The &quot;Whitehurst&quot; was sunk as a target in 1971. The real DE-181 was , a (scrapped 1974).

===Filming===
Despite being set in the South Atlantic, filming of the open ocean scenes took place in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu, Hawaii. A ship collision set and filming of the abandon ship scenes took place off of Los Angeles.

==Music==
The tune sung by the U-boat crew on the ocean floor between depth-charge attacks is from an 18th-century march called &quot;Der Dessauer Marsch,&quot; known by the first line of lyrics as &quot;So leben wir&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s how we live&quot;). The burial hymn in the final scene is &quot;Ich hatt&#x27; einen Kameraden&quot;,

==Awards and nominations==
For the audio effects, Walter Rossi received the 1958 Academy Award for Best Special Effects. The film was also awarded as the best sound-edited feature of 1957 by the Motion Picture Sound Editors.

==Reception==
Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; as a &#x27;compact, competently written, ably acted little drama&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
* The 1966 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; is closely based on the film, with the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; cast as the destroyer and the Romulan vessel, using a cloaking device, as the U-boat.
* Nicholas Meyer has cited the film as an inspiration for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.
* The &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; episode &quot;Killers of the Deep&quot; reused substantial amounts of footage from the film. David Hedison (then Al Hedison), who played Lieutenant Ware, the executive officer of the &quot;Haynes&quot;, also played Commander Lee Crane on &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;.
* In the 1995 film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, two USS &quot;Alabama&quot; officers debate about the cast of &quot;The Enemy Below&quot;.

<text>Melchior Franck (c. 1579 – 1 June 1639) was a German composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was a hugely prolific composer of Lutheran church music, especially motets, and assisted in bringing the stylistic innovations of the Venetian School north across the Alps into Germany.

==Life==
Details of his early life are sparse, as is common for composers of the time. He was born in Zittau, and possibly studied with Christoph Demantius there, and also later with Adam Gumpelzhaimer in Augsburg. By 1601 Franck was in Nuremberg, as a music teacher; there he met Hans Leo Hassler, and learned from him both the Venetian polychoral style and the polyphonic style of the high Renaissance, both of which he incorporated into his own composition.

In 1602 he took a position as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in Coburg to Prince Johann Casimir, and he remained in Coburg for the rest of his life. For the earlier portion of this time, the situation was ideal for him; he was supported by his patron, and had the resources necessary to carry on his composing. The Thirty Years&#x27; War devastated the region around Coburg; in addition to the military depredations, typhus brought by the armies depopulated the entire region and ruined the economy. Franck was able to make a living throughout this period as a musician, unlike his contemporary at Halle, Samuel Scheidt, who lost his &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; post. Franck&#x27;s wife and two of his children died.

==Works==
Franck was a popular composer, and wrote an enormous amount of music, including more than 40 books of motets for a total of over 600 motets alone; in addition he wrote secular songs, including quodlibets, psalm settings, bicinia, tricinia, instrumental dances and numerous miscellaneous pieces.

His motets are varied in style. Many are chorale motets, an exclusively Protestant variation of the motet, and these are written in German. Almost all use the late Renaissance idiom of Lassus, with carefully controlled dissonance and smoothly flowing polyphony. Some are simple and homophonic, and pay unusually close attention to text setting (this was also a trend in the music of the concurrent Catholic Counter-Reformation, and represented a reaction against the music of the previous generations). Others are written in the polychoral style related to the Venetian practice, with the important difference that there is no spatial separation of the choirs: the antiphonal parts are all within the group. However the most unusual is a collection from 1602 called &quot;Contrapuncti&quot;, which are early examples of fugues. They are strictly contrapuntal, and include real answers; occasionally the points of imitation use stretto. Each successive point of imitation uses as its text the successive verse of the chorale being set.

Even though most of his motets use frankly Renaissance contrapuntal idiom, he often used the basso continuo, a relatively recent innovation of the early Baroque, and also used instrumental doublings of the vocal parts.

Franck was a conservative composer who was contemporary with the more famous, and much more progressive, Heinrich Schütz; however his works were popular and often reprinted during his lifetime.

<text>The Yarralumla brickworks, also known as the Commonwealth Brickworks, was one of the earliest construction projects in Canberra, Australia. It was built in the suburb of Yarralumla to produce the bricks used to build many of Canberra&#x27;s early buildings. It opened in around 1913 and operated until its closure in 1976. It is known for producing the bricks used to build itself. Narrow gauge goods railway lines for the transportation of bricks linked Yarralumla to some of the major building sites in central Canberra such as Old Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House. No sign of this early Canberra transport system remains today.

The original brick kilns were built according to Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s designs with fan forced short chimneys intended to stay below the height of the surrounding pine trees. In 1950 after World War II increased building demands in Canberra meant that a large 46 metre natural-draft chimney was built for the new kilns. This greatly increased brick production capacity. The tall chimney is visible from many locations around central Canberra.

In recent years a report found that the tall chimney was not earthquake-safe. As the chimney was heritage listed and located within falling distance of nearby homes, an engineering firm was called in to make it safe. A frame was built inside the chimney to support it without affecting its external appearance.

The brickworks today is closed to the public, but has had various uses over the past 20 years. There have been several recent ideas that haven&#x27;t eventuated, including using the site for Canberra&#x27;s new gaol, making the site the new permanent home for Floriade (a yearly Canberra flower festival) or to turn the brickworks into a holiday resort. Future plans for the site are still undecided. As of February 2015 it was proposed that a housing estate could be constructed on the site, consisting of 1800 dwellings.

<text>CHBC-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, part of the Global Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, and maintains studios on Leon Avenue (near Water Street) in Downtown Kelowna; its main transmitter is located on Blue Grouse Mountain in the Regional District of Central Okanagan.

Since the dismantling of the former E! television system and its switch to Global, CHBC has operated as a semi-satellite of sister station CHAN-DT in Vancouver, airing the majority of its programming in pattern, but with evening newscasts covering the Okanagan region. Due to cost cutting measures by Corus, CHBC&#x27;s local newscasts began to be produced from CHAN-DT&#x27;s studios in August 2024, presented by a single anchor with contributions from local reporters.

==History==
===As a CBC affiliate===
The station first signed on the air on September 21, 1957, originally operating as a CBC affiliate. Its signal covered the central Okanagan, broadcasting at 3,700 watts of power from its main studios and transmitter in Kelowna. The station was founded by three local radio stations: CKOV-AM (now CKQQ-FM) in Kelowna, CKOK (now CKOR) in Penticton and CJIB (now CKIZ-FM) in Vernon. Due to the mountainous terrain of the area, which impaired the primary signal in certain areas, the station began operating repeaters a few weeks later in Vernon (broadcasting on VHF channel 7, at 310 watts) and Penticton (broadcasting on VHF channel 13, at 300 watts). At the time of the station&#x27;s sign-on, only 500 homes in the area had television receivers, but that amount rose to 10,000 the following year. The station had ordered two studio cameras, but due to the number of television stations that started up in North America during that period, the station had to make do with one camera on loan for a year until the order was filled. They also relied on 16 mm film, which was developed first by a local photo lab, and then again in-house.

All network programs were originally received on kinescope and 16 mm film, with regular programs airing on a week delay after their airing on CBC stations in other markets, with the &quot;National News&quot; airing on a day-behind basis. In 1960, the station began receiving programs from the CBC via its microwave link. Local programs and advertisements were produced live to air. Locally produced programs during the station&#x27;s early days included &quot;Kids Bids&quot;, &quot;The Three R&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Romper Room&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Visit&quot;, &quot;Midday&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot; and &quot;Okanagan Magazine&quot;. In 1964, CHBC received its first videotape machine, which aided the production of local programming and commercials. Two years later, the station began airing programming in colour via the network, and the station gradually installed more equipment for colour production and transmission, as well as telecine and videotape.

In the late 1960s, CHBC and fellow CBC affiliate CFJC-TV in Kamloops formed BCI-TV (standing for &quot;British Columbia Interior Television&quot;), an internal company headed by CHBC for programming and sales of the combined Okanagan/Kamloops markets. The national sales were delegated to All Canada Sales, which provided advertising sales for both stations as a single unit under the name &quot;BCI TV&quot;. For years, both stations carried virtually identical programming schedules, apart from local newscasts. In 1970, CHAN-TV in Vancouver reached an agreement with CHBC to provide CTV programming to the area, via a protective service, which protected local advertisers from Vancouver advertisers with cut-ins on the second station. The full conversion to colour broadcasts was completed in 1971, when CHBC purchased a colour studio camera.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the ownership of the station changed, beginning with the purchase of CKOK&#x27;s one-third ownership by general manager Roy Chapman, which he later sold to CHAN. Selkirk Communications brought CJIB, and along with it, its 33% stake. CKOV sold its stake in equal parts to both CHAN and Selkirk, which resulted in both companies each owning 50% of the station. In 1987, CHBC president and general manager Ron Evans spearheaded a campaign as part of its adopted branding as &quot;The Okanagan&#x27;s Very Own CHBC&quot;, in order to compete with the 40 television station signals that were being distributed by cable operators within the market. As a result, the station increased its local programming and advertisements, and CHBC increased its involvement in the 55 communities that it served. This commitment has been recognized and rewarded through the improvement of its ratings and nods from many industry awards; CHBC was often held-up as a Canadian model for its ability to identify with the community it served during this era.

When Maclean-Hunter took over Selkirk in 1989, CHAN&#x27;s parent company Western International Communications (WIC) purchased Selkirk&#x27;s stake to take full control of CHBC. In 1998, the Griffiths family&#x27;s stake in WIC was sold to a joint venture between Shaw Communications and Canwest. After months of negotiations, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the split of WIC&#x27;s assets between Canwest, Corus Radio and Shaw Communications. CHBC and sister station CHAN-TV were sold to Canwest in 2000. When Canwest acquired CHBC, it assumed the same role in selling advertising and providing programming, primarily from its CH television system.

===As a CH/E! O&amp;O===
In late 2003, the CBC notified CHBC that it did not intend to renew its affiliation agreement with the station after it expired in August 2005. In response, the station filed an application with the CRTC in 2004 to disaffiliate from the CBC; the CRTC gave approval to the disaffiliation on February 28, 2005. CBC Television&#x27;s Vancouver O&amp;O CBUT subsequently added a new rebroadcast transmitter in Kelowna, broadcasting on UHF channel 45. After its BCI-TV partner CFJC-TV received similar approval to disaffiliate from the CBC, both stations switched affiliations on February 27, 2006, and continued the operation of BCI-TV with new programs supplied from Canwest&#x27;s secondary CH television system.
CHBC was the only Canwest-owned CH station to not use the CH brand on-air, opting to brand by its call letters instead, with its newscasts being titled &quot;CHBC News&quot;. The local newscast branding remained in use following CH&#x27;s rebranding as E! in 2007. All programming on CHBC outside locally produced shows were branded under the &quot;E!&quot; name.

In November 2008, CHBC announced that it would move the production facilities for its newscasts from its studios in Kelowna to sister station CHEK in Victoria, to be produced from a virtual set, with production being taken over by Vancouver sister CHAN-TV. In addition, the noon newscast was cancelled.

===As a Global O&amp;O===

On February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore &quot;strategic options&quot;, including a possible sale, for CHBC and its other E! owned-and-operated stations, stating that &quot;a second conventional TV network [was] no longer key to the long-term success&quot; of the company. Although for a time it was reported that CHBC might cease operations, Canwest ultimately decided to convert it into a Global owned-and-operated station on August 31, 2009. The Global Television Network&#x27;s programming was already available in the Okanagan region through CHAN-TV out of Vancouver, which has operated a semi-satellite in the region, CHKL-TV, since the early 1980s. Station management later reversed its decision to move the studio segments to Victoria due to viewer complaints. The half-hour 11:00 p.m. newscast would later be expanded to one hour to make up for the loss of the half-hour noon newscast, while the 5:00 p.m. news began with a half-hour lifestyle-oriented newscast that was anchored by Doris Janssen.

CHBC and CHAN were expected to continue to operate separately for the foreseeable future, due in large part to the two stations&#x27; highly rated local and provincial newscasts. However, the two stations&#x27; schedules and advertising are virtually identical, including local news programming outside the supper hour. More specifically, CHBC simulcasts CHAN&#x27;s programming at all times, with the exception of daily Kelowna-based newscasts seen exclusively on CHBC and its scheduling of the network&#x27;s national evening newscast &quot;Global National&quot;, which CHBC airs at 6:00 p.m. (whereas CHAN airs it at 5:30 p.m.). Initially, there were also very minor differences within the two stations&#x27; prime time schedules, however both CHAN and CHBC began airing a common prime time schedule by the fall of 2011 if not sooner.

On July 7, 2010, CHBC introduced a new virtual set that is controlled out of the master control facilities at CHAN&#x27;s studios in Vancouver. The station dropped the E!-era graphics it used for its newscasts and implemented a package used by Global&#x27;s O&amp;Os, but the station&#x27;s newscasts continued to be branded as &quot;CHBC News&quot; until April 2013, when its newscasts were retitled as &quot;Global Okanagan News&quot;.

After Canwest filed for creditor protection in October 2009, Shaw Communications purchased the broadcasting assets of Canwest; the acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010.

==News operation==

Until 2024, CHBC-DT broadcast hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). CHBC produced an hour-long early evening newscast at 5 p.m. on weeknights, a half-hour newscast at 5:30 on Saturday and Sunday evenings, and a half-hour newscast at 6:30 and an 11 p.m. newscast seven nights a week (the latter airs for an hour on weeknights and a half-hour on weekends). CHBC had previously aired hours per week of local programming until September 2009. The minimum amount of local programming currently required by the station&#x27;s licence as of 2009 is seven hours per week.

Due to corporate cutbacks instituted by Canwest in September 2009, CHBC stopped utilizing live newsgathering services in Vernon, Kelowna and Penticton; in addition, the station&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast and a weekly half-hour newsmagazine, &quot;Okanagan Now&quot;, which was dedicated to events happening around the Okanagan region, were cancelled. CHBC began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (over its HD feed on Shaw Cable 211) on July 6, 2011. Five days later on July 11, 2011, the station began using its live newsgathering resources once again and restored an hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast to its schedule. Since April 2016, the hour-long news program&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Global News at 5&quot;. CHBC also has a program called &quot;Global News at 6:30&quot; which airs after &quot;Global National&quot;. &quot;Global News at 5&quot; was anchored by Rick Webber with Wesla Wong and Duane English alternating days on weather. &quot;Global News at 6:30&quot; was anchored by Rick Webber and Doris Maria Bregolisse. Weather anchor Wesla Wong resigned in February 2018 and Duane English also resigned, effective April 2, 2018.

After 30 years on the air as the main news anchor, Rick Webber retired on July 31, 2019.

Due to corporate cutbacks instituted by Corus Entertainment in August 2024, local production of CHBC newscasts ended on August 16, 2024. Since August 19, 2024, CHBC&#x27;s newscasts have been produced out of the facilities of CHAN with contributions from local reporters, and were cut to half-hour bulletins aired at 5:30, 6:30, and 11 p.m. All CHBC newscasts are now solely anchored by Coleen Christie, a reporter of Global News: BC 1. Coming alongside similar cuts to news programming at several Ontario stations, Corus stated that it had &quot;reimagined our broadcast schedule in Kingston, Peterborough, and Kelowna with a focus on supper hour and late-night news programming&quot;. The changes were met with criticism from station employees and local residents. City councillor Mohini Singh questioned Corus&#x27; continued commitment to the market, whether the newscasts would remain locally relevant, and whether the cuts were in compliance with the station&#x27;s CRTC license.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On October 15, 2012, CHBC flash cut the digital signals of its main Kelowna transmitter and its rebroadcasters in Penticton and Vernon into operation on UHF channels 27, 32 and 20. Digital television receivers display CHBC&#x27;s virtual channel on its main transmitter as channel 2.2 (indirectly corresponding to its analogue-era VHF channel 2).

All of the station&#x27;s transmitters must convert to digital broadcasts before August 31, 2016, as part of a promise that Shaw Media made to the CRTC during its acquisition of Canwest.

<doc id="1167200" wikidata="Q1754981" url="?curid=1167200" title="The Art of War (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album)">
<text>The Art of War is the third studio album by hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony which was released on July 29, 1997. The album sold 394,000 units in its first week of release. The album was certified quadruple Platinum by the RIAA in June 1998. It was the first double-album from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. The album included the platinum-single &quot;Look into My Eyes&quot;, and the gold-single &quot;If I Could Teach the World&quot;. The whole album is produced by DJ U-Neek.

A sequel to the album, &quot;The Art of War World War 3&quot;, was released on December 10, 2013.

==Singles==
&quot;Look Into My Eyes&quot; was the first commercial and radio single from &quot;The Art of War&quot;. &quot;Look Into My Eyes&quot; had debuted and peaked to number 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Songs then was able to debuted and peak at number 2 on Hot Rap Songs and spent 20 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Songs and spent 35 weeks on Hot Rap Songs. Later, two more two more radio singles were released: &quot;Thug Luv&quot;, which ended up charting at number 60 on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay for 3 weeks, and &quot;Body Rott&quot;, which didn&#x27;t appear on any charts. The final commercial single off the album, &quot;If I Could Teach The World&quot; peaked at number 27 on Hot 100, at number 20 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Songs and number 3 on Hot Rap Songs.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Art of War&quot; had sold 394,000 copies in its first week and went along to debut at number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. It dropped to number two on both during the second week, after the release of Puff Daddy &amp; The Family&#x27;s &quot;No Way Out&quot; while selling 183,000 copies in its second week to Diddy&#x27;s 223,000 copies sold.

==Background==
The album was rumored to be called &quot;DNA Level C&quot; which is Cleveland backwards. &quot;The Art of War&quot; was created largely as a response to rappers deemed &quot;Clones&quot; (copycats) by the group. Such rappers included Do or Die, Crucial Conflict, Twista &amp; The Speedknots &amp; Three 6 Mafia.

In the wake of his father&#x27;s death and Tomica Wright now heading Ruthless, Bizzy Bone was not happy, and thus did not appear for many shows or promotions. Now calling the shots, many tracks were altered by Tomica Wright, attempting to head the group into a new direction. Such tracks include Thug Luv with Sylk-E. Fyne, If I Could Teach the World, Friends, Ready 4 War, Handle The Vibe with Flesh-n-Bone and many others. While the group appeared at Sprite Nite on BET, Keenan Ivory Wayans (with Bizzy), and several other promotions, their tour began to lag without Bizzy.

==Music and lyrics==
In &quot;Ready 4 War&quot;, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (along with Maje$ty) called out Crucial Conflict directly by name, with Maje$ty even stating, &quot;I&#x27;ll watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom&quot;. The tracks &quot;Handle The Vibe,&quot; &quot;Look Into My Eyes,&quot; &quot;Body Rott,&quot; &quot;Ready 4 War,&quot; &quot;Hatin&#x27; Nation,&quot; Wasteland Warriors,&quot; &quot;All Original,&quot; &quot;Whom Die They Lie&quot; and &quot;U Ain&#x27;t Bone&quot; can all be considered as diss tracks.

They also changed the name of &quot;Friends&quot; for the cassette version to &quot;How Many of Us Have Them&quot;. 2Pac wrote his verse for &quot;Thug Luv&quot; in 1 minute and 51 seconds as confirmed by Bizzy Bone.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Art of War&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with some critics calling the album sonically superior to its predecessor, &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;. Others criticized the album&#x27;s length and repetitive disses toward other rappers. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said, &quot;While the group is capable of producing a catchy single, they don&#x27;t have the personality to sustain an album, much less a double-disc set. By the end of the second disc, they have repeated all of their ideas at least five times apiece, and only a few of those ideas resulted in actual songs in the first place.&quot; J.D. Considine of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;Lest the smooth sound of &#x27;Look Into My Eyes&#x27; leaves you thinking the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony are really just pop-friendly softies, this 28-song double disc, The Art of War, offsets its slow-and-sweet numbers with bloodthirsty workouts like the shotgun-spiked &#x27;Thug Luv&#x27;. But after two hours of these singsong melodies, War seems more like a siege than a surgical strike.&quot;

==Legacy==
Krayzie Bone said in a 2015 interview with &quot;HipHopDX&quot; that &quot;The Art of War&quot; was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s best album, even better than &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;. Compared to &quot;Eternal&quot;, whose songs he claimed were planned and written years before they were recorded, &quot;The Art of War&quot; consisted entirely of newer material that he and the other group members created in the studio. Rapper Wiz Khalifa included the album in his list of 25 favorite albums.

<doc id="1167202" wikidata="Q1759462" url="?curid=1167202" title="Milstar">
<text>Milstar (Military Strategic and Tactical Relay) is a constellation of military communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit, which are operated by the United States Space Force, and provide secure and jam-resistant worldwide communications to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces of the United States. Six spacecraft were launched between 1994 and 2003, of which only five were operational after launch; the third launch failed, both damaging the satellite and leaving it in an unusable orbit.

== History ==
Milstar Block I spacecraft, or Milstar Developmental Flight Satellite (DFS)-1 and -2, were designed with a Low Data Rate (LDR) payload in the wing of the satellite that broadcast in the Super High Frequency (SHF) and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) ranges, and also a classified communication payload in the wing. The DFS-1 satellite was launched on 7 February 1994 aboard the first Titan IV(401)A rocket, but with the classified wing payload deactivated. It was followed by the DFS-2 spacecraft on 7 November 1995. DFS-2 was similar to DFS-1, but the classified payload was replaced by ballast in the form of a precision machined aluminum block to maintain the weight and balance characteristics of the satellite. Both Block I satellites (USA-99 and USA-115) are still operational as of August 2016, over 20 years since they were launched.

The four later satellites were Block II spacecraft, which featured an additional medium data-rate payload. The first Block II satellite (DFS-3m, a hybrid mix of largely Block I support systems and LDR payload and a MDR (Medium Data Rate) Block II payload) was launched on 30 April 1999, using a Titan IV(401)B rocket. Due to a database error affecting the attitude control system of the Centaur upper stage of its carrier rocket, it was placed into a lower orbit than had been planned, and damaged by deployment at excessive rates. It could not be raised into its operational orbit due to fuel limitations. Its orbit was raised as much as possible to increase the expected lifetime and then it was permanently turned off after 10 days. It was the third consecutive, and last, failure of a Titan IV rocket. The remaining three satellites (DFS-4, -5, and -6) were launched on 27 February 2001, 15 January 2002, and 8 April 2003.

The Milstar system consists of three segments; the space segment which consists of the six satellites, ground terminals and users, and stations to command and control the satellites. The Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing (MCSW) division of the Space and Missile Systems Center, located at Los Angeles AFB was responsible for development and acquisition of the Milstar space and mission control segments. The Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom AFB is responsible for the US Air Force portion of the terminal segment development and acquisition. The 4th Space Operations Squadron at Schriever SFB and the 148th Space Operations Squadron at Vandenberg SFB are responsible for providing real-time satellite control and communications payload management.

In August 2010 control of the Milstar system was transferred to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency program, in preparation for the launch of the first AEHF satellite, USA-214. Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites are intended to replace Milstar.

==Characteristics==
Milstar satellites provide secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to meet the requirements of the United States military. They were built by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Corporation, at a cost of US$800 million each. Each satellite has a design life of 10 years. Six were built, of which five reached their operational geosynchronous orbits, and remain in service. Launches were made using Titan IV rockets with Centaur upper stages, and all six occurred from Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The satellites are designed to provide communications which are hard to detect and intercept, and to be survivable in the event of nuclear warfare.

The spacecraft have a mass of , and are equipped with solar panels which generate eight kilowatts of electric power to power its transponders. Both Block I and Block II satellites provide low data-rate communications at bandwidths between 75 bit/s and 2,400 bit/s, whilst the Block II spacecraft can also provide medium data-rate communications between 4.8 kbit/s and 1.544 Mbit/s. The satellites&#x27; uplinks operate in the Q band, while their downlinks operate within the K band. The uplink corresponds to the extremely high frequency band while downlink corresponds to the super high frequency radio band.

<text>Jeff Stewart (born June 21, 1980) is an American soccer defender who last played for Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.

Stewart played college soccer at Santa Clara University from 1998 to 2001. As a junior, he was named the West Coast Conference Defender of the Year; he finished his career at Santa Clara with six goals and one assist in 81 games, 65 of them starts.

Upon graduating, Stewart was selected 19th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by Rapids. Stewart immediately earned a starting place, appearing in 23 games for the Rapids as a rookie, and adding three assists. Stewart started seven of eight games for the team in 2003, before suffering a serious knee injury that kept him out the rest of the season. Unfortunately, Stewart would suffer injury problems throughout the 2004 season as well and, combined with new competition from Nat Borchers, he did not see any playing time.

Stewart was selected 19th overall in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft by Chivas USA. Five days later he was traded to Real Salt Lake for a permanent international roster slot. However, Stewart was not able to come back from the injuries and was placed on the season-ending injured reserve.

<doc id="1167214" wikidata="Q2872451" url="?curid=1167214" title="Auto-Train Corporation">
<text>Auto-Train Corporation , stylized &quot;auto-train&quot;, was a privately owned passenger railroad that operated from 1971 to 1981. Its trains included autorack cars, enabling passengers to bring their own vehicles on their journey. The company used its own rolling stock, and traveled on rails leased from major railroads. It served central Florida from points in the Mid-Atlantic region near Washington, D.C., and the Midwest near Louisville, Kentucky. The company failed after 10 years despite the popularity of the service on its primary route, which parallels busy Interstate 95 in five states along the eastern U.S. coast. 

After a hiatus, a similarly named and operated service, Auto Train, began under the government-financed Amtrak in 1983, which became one of the railroad&#x27;s most popular services.

== History ==
An idea of Auto-Train Corporation founder Eugene K. Garfield, a former employee of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the novel approach allowed families to relax en route and save the expense and unfamiliarity of a rental car on arrival. The Auto-Train consists included passenger cars, autoracks, and a caboose. Although the company had its own locomotives and rolling stock, Auto-Train Corporation trains initially operated on Seaboard Coast Line (SCL) and Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac (RF&amp;P) tracks.

Auto-Train Corporation&#x27;s new service began operations on December 6, 1971, between Lorton, Virginia, and Sanford, Florida. The service was popular with travelers. Soon, Auto-Train entrepreneurs sought to expand into other markets, and established a short-lived service between Louisville and Sanford, Florida. In 1978, the company announced plans for a service in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo and Querétaro City.

Lack of success from the Louisville expansion, high crew costs, and several accidents put Garfield&#x27;s company into bankruptcy. Auto-Train Corporation ended its services in late April 1981.

=== Amtrak revival ===
Operating for almost 10 years, Auto-Train had developed a popular following, particularly among older travelers. No one else offered a similar service until, after a gap of almost two years, service was revived by Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation), as their Auto Train service.

== Rolling stock ==
=== Locomotives ===
Auto-Train used 13 GE U36B locomotives (4 additional units were ordered but were never delivered due to financial issues) as the primary motive power for its trains. Also included in the roster were Baldwin S-12, Baldwin VO-1000, and ALCO S-2 locomotives that were used as switchers in the terminal stations.

=== Dome cars ===

Auto-Train acquired a significant number of dome cars, so many that in 1974 it did not roster any conventional coaches. These included seven ex-Western Pacific dome coaches, each seating 36, which Auto-Train called &quot;Mini-Domes&quot;. These had previously run on the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;. It also acquired all but one of the Santa Fe&#x27;s Big Domes (six dormitory-lounges and seven of eight full lounges) and the majority of the Union Pacific&#x27;s Astra Dome fleet: seven coaches, nine dining cars, and 14 lounge-observation cars. Two of the Big Dome lounges and two of the Astra Dome lounges were rebuilt as &quot;Night Club&quot; cars. The remainder of the Astra Domes were dubbed &quot;Maxie-Domes&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Mini-Domes&quot;.

=== Food service cars ===
Auto-Train acquired a wide variety of food-service cars. These included ex-Seaboard kitchen-dormitory cars, ex-Seaboard dining cars rebuilt as buffet cars, and five Norfolk and Western and Western Pacific coaches which were also rebuilt as buffet cars.

=== Sleeping cars ===
Sleeping cars acquired by Auto-Train included six ex-Santa Fe Regal series sleeping cars (four bedrooms, four compartments, two drawing rooms), five ex-Union Pacific Ocean series sleeping cars (five bedrooms, two compartment, two drawing rooms), and three ex-Seaboard sleepers (five bedrooms, one compartment, four sections, four roomettes).

=== Nonpassenger stock ===

The centerpieces of the Auto-Train were the 62 ex-Canadian National bilevel autoracks, which were acquired between 1971 and 1973. The passenger equipment acquired by Auto-Train used steam heat, so the company also acquired steam generator cars. These were mostly former Great Northern cars, but the Auto-Train also rebuilt several former Western Pacific and Santa Fe baggage cars into steam generator cars.

<text>NBCUniversal Media Group is the television and streaming arm of NBCUniversal, and the direct descendant and successor of the former division NBCUniversal Television Group, which existed from 2004 to 2019.

==History==
===NBC Broadcasting===
In 2006, NBCUniversal sold four stations from its smallest markets. In November 2007, the NBC Owned Television Stations changed its name to NBC Local Media. In March 2008, Local Media decided to focus on growing websites and the top ten market stations, placing WTVJ in Miami and WVIT in Hartford up for sale.

LXTV was acquired in January 2008 by NBC Local Media followed in March by the purchased of Skycastle Entertainment, Local Media&#x27;s former outside sales and marketing firm. After NBC Weather Plus was shut down in late 2008, WNBC launched a replacement programming of local information, news and lifestyle as NBC New York Nonstop in March 2009 using LXTV programs.

In May 2009, NBC rolled out a tiered affiliation plan. The plan has three levels: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Bronze is the standard existing short term affiliation, programming with ad inventory splits. With the silver plan, the affiliate and network would add working in other media: internet, wireless and video on demand areas with inventory splits, a different financial arrangement and promotion commitments. Gold affiliation agreement is a longer broader partnership in local online media and mobile digital TV with the network representing the gold affiliates in cable and satellite retransmission consent negotiations with the network sharing in the carriage revenue. A NBClocal.com livestyle website would be a part of the silver package. By July 2009, GE has been registering NBC&quot;market&quot;.com domains (like NBCIndianapolis.com) in markets where NBC stations are not NBC owned. NBC Affiliates Board chair Mike Fiorile indicated a preference on behalf of local stations that the local station should own its own brand in the market. Local Newser indicated that this might be attempt by NBC to compete with their local affiliates despite pointing out the NBC local program as a part of its top tier affiliation plans.

On October 24, 2012, NBC Owned Television Stations announced it will relaunch the NBC Nonstop network as Cozi TV, which will feature classic television shows, films and original programming. In July 2013, NBCU placed NBC TV Stations and Telemundo&#x27;s O&amp;Os stations into a new division, NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations, with New England Cable News being transferred into NBC TV Stations.

===Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News===
With Ted Harbert departing as head of NBC Broadcasting in September 2016, Mark Lazarus (as chairman of NBC Broadcasting and Sports) added this group to his responsibility over NBC Sports Group. In January 2019, NBCUniversal was reorganized to make way for their streaming service. Lazarus added NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group and NBCUniversal News Group to his portfolio, now as chairman of NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News (except for NBC Entertainment).

In an April 2020 reorganization, Lazarus was named chairman of NBCUniversal Television and Streaming with the addition of responsibility over NBC Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises and Telemundo Enterprises. Andrew Lack also exited as chairman of NBCUniversal News Group as he was succeeded by Cesar Conde.

==Units==
===NBC Entertainment===
NBC Entertainment is NBCUniversal&#x27;s entertainment arm of the NBC television network. The division has prime time programming, business affairs, West Coast research, marketing, public relations and network scheduling.

====History====
In July 2008, Universal Cable Productions was split off from Universal Media Studios and placed into NBCUniversal&#x27;s NBCU Cable Entertainment division. On Monday, September 12, 2011, Universal Media Studios was renamed to Universal Television.

NBC Entertainment named Paul Telegdy as president of both its alternative and reality TV group and NBC Entertainment, along the formation of Universal Television Alternative Studios by president Meredith Ahr in June 2016. These promotions are part of a push for NBC to create and distribute future reality TV shows. However, late night programming was removed from Teledgy&#x27;s portfolio, which also included annual specials. On September 24, 2018, Bob Greenblatt left NBC Entertainment&#x27;s chairman position and was replaced by George Cheeks and Paul Telegdy.

With the reorganization of NBCUniversal in January 2019, Jeff Shell (currently chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group) added NBC Entertainment, Telemundo Enterprises and many international channels to his portfolio, now as chairman of NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment. In October 2019, NBCUniversal Content Studios was formed to house Universal Television and NBC&#x27;s late night programming, with Cheeks joining from NBC Entertainment.

In an April 2020 reorganization, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming was formed with NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News with the addition of NBC Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises and Telemundo Enterprises.

===NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations===
NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations is a station holding division with two groups, NBC Owned Television Stations and Telemundo Station Group.

====History====
In July 2013, NBC Owned Television Stations and Telemundo&#x27;s O&amp;Os stations merged to form a new division, NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations under NBC TV Station president Valari Staab. NBC Responds/Telemundo Responde units were launched by NBCU Stations in 2014 with a central Consumer Investigative Center based in Dallas. Center and the units investigate consumer rip off with the intent of getting money back for the complainant. By 2019, 18 stations were operating a Responds team with two more started up in 2019 (WTMO Orlando and KTDO El Paso) and 2 more planned in 2020.

With the January 7, 2016, announcement of the new owned and operated NBC Boston station was that the new station would be cluster with the other Boston outlets, New England Cable News and WNEU (Telemundo Boston) under their president Mike St. Peter. In March 2016, NBCU announced the NBCUniversal Boston Media Center, a regional headquarters in Needham Crossing office park, bringing together the cluster from Newton and the NBC Sports Boston cable channel from Burlington together. Opened in January 2020, the center also came equip with a podcast production studio as mainstream media starts pushing into the podcast industry.

In 2017, NBC announced that it was hiring people for KNSD with the intention of launching a new Telemundo O&amp;O station in San Diego, replacing Tijuana, Mexico-licensed station XHAS-TDT (whose affiliation expired at the end of June 2017). The new Telemundo affiliate, branded as &quot;Telemundo 20&quot;, launched on July 1 on KNSD&#x27;s digital 39.20 subchannel. Additionally, KNSD launched TeleXitos, a Spanish equivalent to Cozi TV, on channel 39.21 the same day. On September 12, 2017, NBCUniversal acquired KUAN-LD from NRJ TV, LLC, the owner of KSCI, for $650,000; the sale was completed on December 21, 2017. Concurrently, KUAN entered into a channel-sharing agreement with KNSD. This was done with the separate KUAN-LD transmitter ending service, and 39.20 and 39.21 becoming identified with KUAN-LD instead and re-numbered to KUAN&#x27;s channel 48.

====History====
=====NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment &amp; Cable Studios=====
In July 2008, Universal Cable Productions was split from Universal Media Studios (UMS) and placed into NBCUniversal&#x27;s NBCU Cable Entertainment Group division. The unit was placed under the direction of a management team consisting of 5 executives.

=====NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group=====
In February 2013, following the acquisition of the company by Comcast, NBCUniversal merged its two cable divisions, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment &amp; Cable Studios and NBCUniversal Entertainment &amp; Digital Networks and Integrated Media, into one unit. By April 2013, Comcast Entertainment Studios, or E! Studios, was renamed Wilshire Studios. Jeff Wachtel was transferred from his position as co-president of USA to head of content at Universal Cable Productions.

With the resignation of E! President Suzanne Kolb in September 2014, NBCU Cable announced the formation of Lifestyle Network Group consisting of Bravo, Oxygen, E! Entertainment and Esquire Network. The Group was to be led by Frances Berwick, president of Bravo and Oxygen Media with Esquire Network president Adam Stotsky to take over as general manager of E!

On April 14, 2014, Comcast purchased Lions Gate Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment&#x27;s stakes in Fearnet, acquiring full ownership of the channel. Comcast plans to fold Fearnet into its existing horror- and thriller-focused network Chiller (owned by the company&#x27;s NBCUniversal Cable unit), although some of Fearnet&#x27;s programming may be moved to Syfy.

Hammer ordered a reorganization that creates the Entertainment Networks group with Chiller, Cloo, Syfy, and USA Network by transferring two Syfy executives out and placing USA Network president Chris McCumber in charge of the group as president. Transferred Syfy executives include the executive vice president of original content, who moved to the post of executive vice president of scripted content under the chief content officer of NBCU Cable, and the president of Syfy and Chiller, who moved to president of strategy and commercial growth at NBCU Cable. Sprout was also added to Lifestyle Network. On September 9, 2017, Sprout was renamed to Universal Kids while the Sprout brand would be used for its pre-school programming block until January 26, 2018, when the Sprout branding was removed from the block, and it was renamed Universal Kids Preschool.

The group agreed to purchase a majority stake in Craftsy digital network from equity firms in May 2017. Craftsy was renamed Bluprint with Craftsy.com become its a la carte classes and Craftsy Unlimited service becoming Bluprint, while adding additional lifestyle categories.

In January 2019, NBCUniversal reorganized to make way for their streaming service. Bonnie Hammer was transferred to the new post of chairman at Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises for NBCUniversal, while the cable group was placed under the NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News group.

In early 2019, Universal Cable Productions changed its name to Universal Content Productions in order to reflect the move into digital productions. In October 2019, Universal Content Productions was transferred from NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group to NBCUniversal Content Studios. Further restructuring placed the two cable networks in April 2020 under NBCU Television and Streaming.

<text>The Powerpuff Girls Movie is a 2002 American animated superhero film based on the Cartoon Network animated television series &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. It was co-written and directed by series&#x27; creator Craig McCracken (in his feature-length directorial debut), co-written by Charlie Bean, Lauren Faust, Paul Rudish, and Don Shank, and stars the regular television cast of Catherine Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, Roger L. Jackson, Tom Kane, Tom Kenny, Jennifer Hale, and Jennifer Martin. The film serves as a prequel to the series, and tells the origin story of how the Powerpuff Girls were created and came to be the defenders of Townsville and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain.

Produced by Cartoon Network Studios as its first theatrical film, and the first theatrical film to be based on a Cartoon Network series, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; was released in theaters on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Although a financial failure earning $16 million worldwide on the budget of $11 million, the film mostly received positive reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
In the crime and injustice-riddled city of Townsville, Professor Utonium mixes sugar, spice and everything nice, hoping to produce the &quot;perfect little girls&quot; to improve Townsville. However, he accidentally breaks a flask of Chemical X, which spills onto the concoction. The experiment succeeds, producing three little girls whom the Professor names Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. He also discovers that the girls have gained superpowers from the added Chemical X. Despite the girls&#x27; recklessness with their powers, they all immediately grow to love each other as a family.

On their first day of school, the girls learn about the game of tag and begin to play it among themselves, which quickly grows destructive once they use their powers. The girls take their game downtown, where they cause extensive damage to the city until the Professor calms them down. That night, the Professor tells the girls to not use their powers in public anymore. The next day, the citizens of Townsville treat the girls as outcasts due to their destructive behavior. The Professor is arrested and jailed, which forces the girls to try to make their way home from school on foot. After a while, they become lost in an alleyway, where the Gangreen Gang corners them. Suddenly, a chimpanzee named Jojo, who was the Professor&#x27;s destructive laboratory assistant until gaining superintelligence due to the Chemical X explosion mutating his brain, rescues the trio.

Bitter over the Professor favoring the girls instead of him, Jojo gains their sympathy by convincing them that he is also hated for his powers and tricks them into helping him build a laboratory and a machine powered by Chemical X, which he claims will &quot;improve the city&quot;. Afterward, Jojo rewards them with a trip to the local zoo, where he secretly implants small transportation devices on all the primates there. That night, Jojo teleports the primates to his lab and uses his new machine to inject them with Chemical X, which turns them into evil mutants like himself. The next morning, after the Professor is released from prison, the girls show him all the &quot;good&quot; they have done, only to discover that the primates are attacking the city. Jojo, renaming himself as Mojo Jojo, publicly announces the girls assisted him, which damages their reputation further and makes the distraught Professor lose faith in them. Dejected, the girls exile themselves on an asteroid in outer space.

Mojo announces his intention to rule the planet but becomes frustrated when his minions disobey him and concoct their own plans to terrorize Townsville. Meanwhile, on the asteroid, the banished girls hear Mojo trying to strangle the Professor and return to Earth, where they start rescuing the citizens. After Buttercup uses her powers to defeat a giant ape, Blossom convinces the former and Bubbles that they can use their powers to fight back. After his army is defeated, Mojo gives himself an overdose of Chemical X and grows into a giant monster, easily subduing the girls. Rejecting Mojo&#x27;s offer of an alliance to take over the world, the girls push him off a decrepit skyscraper just as the Professor arrives with an antidote for Chemical X. Mojo lands on the Antidote X, which shrinks him down to his original size and allows the police to arrest him.

The girls consider using the Antidote X to remove their powers, thinking they would be accepted as normal girls, but the people of Townsville protest against this, apologize for misjudging them, and their heroism is praised. The Mayor of Townsville requests that the girls use their powers to fight crime in the city and with permission from the Professor, they become the city&#x27;s most beloved crime-fighting superhero team, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

== Production ==
During the film&#x27;s production, series creator and director Craig McCracken did not want it to appeal exclusively to girls, as the series&#x27; merchandise made it out to be, choosing to make an action-adventure film that felt closer to his conception of the Powerpuff Girls. When deciding what the final plot would be, the crew had &quot;one that was purely an action show, and then one that was more of a subtle character piece&quot;. Cartoon Network liked both of them, so the result is a hybrid. McCracken said that there was no real difference when directing the film in comparison to a standard TV episode:

&quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; was known for its audience being highly composed by &quot;underground&quot; adults, and the film was intended in part to appeal to that demographic. According to Cartoon Network executives, it was also meant to &quot;spark sales of DVDs and home videos, pack in crowds overseas and set kids scrambling to buy cartoon-themed merchandise&quot;. Jim Samples, executive vice president and general manager of the network, saw the year 2002 as a good opportunity to bring the show to the big screen, given the success of family features such as Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; and the live-action adaptation of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. During production, McCracken was encouraged by Cartoon Network to make an edgier film; he recalled via Tumblr:

Like the series, the film&#x27;s animation was provided by Rough Draft Korea, with additional digital compositing and effects by Mercury Filmworks and additional animation by Savage Frog! and Virtual Magic Animation. All work done overseas was then shipped to Los Angeles, where the main crew put every single shot together digitally at the recently opened Cartoon Network Studios. The film keeps the staple look of the television series with minimal changes, with characters such as the Girls and the Professor having a mostly geometric look. The backgrounds are hand-drawn with some computer-generated enhancements. The movie also went on to have some minor edits in pacing for the final cut, but &quot;nothing so disastrous that it affected the final film&quot;, according to McCracken. It was noted that promotion for the film was rather limited when compared to that of other animated films from the same year, such as &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;. However, McCracken said that Warner Bros. was putting $20 million into promoting the film. Some of the production process was also documented for the film&#x27;s subsequent home video releases. According to McCracken, 49 half-hour episodes of the TV series had been made up to that point, but production on the show went on hiatus to focus on the making of the movie.

== Music ==
The crew was against including pop songs or any musical numbers that would interfere &quot;in the body of the story&quot;, in order to respect audience expectations. However, the end credits are accompanied by a punk rock version of the series&#x27; ending theme by Bis, as well as &quot;Pray for the Girls&quot; by Frank Black and &quot;That&#x27;s What Girls Do&quot; by No Secrets. James L. Venable, who composed the music for the television series, also composed the film&#x27;s score, blending traditional orchestration with electronica. He had listened to &quot;old monster movie scores&quot; and acts such as The Chemical Brothers and Propellerheads for inspiration in developing the series&#x27; musical style, which was then poured into the movie. McCracken thought the band Gorillaz would be fitting to perform the film&#x27;s ending credits song, considering that the plot is about &quot;evil monkeys attacking Townsville&quot; and that the band members are animated. Gorillaz creators Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn showed interest in composing the song, but their schedule made it impossible to accomplish.

== Promotion ==
By February 2002, the film was already being promoted on Cartoon Network&#x27;s official website, where details about the &quot;Be an Artist&quot; contest were available, prompting fans in the United States under the age of 18 to send their drawings in the hopes of having it appear in a scene from the movie. The main winner was Laura Krammer, a 13-year-old girl from Ligonier, Indiana, who was chosen by director Craig McCracken. In Latin America, kids could enter a contest in which the first place winner earned three tickets for the movie and a video camera. One of Delta Express&#x27; Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft (registered N310DA) featured a special aircraft with &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot;-themed livery, and customers were given promotional items regarding the movie, including activity sheets, temporary tattoos and buttons.

Kids&#x27; WB aired four episodes of the television show in a marathon to help promote the movie. Prior to the release of the film, Daisy Rock produced a heart-shaped, 3/4 scale, pink guitar featuring all three Powerpuff Girls, and another featuring Mojo Jojo in a &quot;premium alder body&quot; with a 24-3/4&quot; scale. Both instruments had a limited release. Out of the one hundred, some were given to cable viewers during the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays primetime block on May 31, 2002. A few others were available on Cartoon Network&#x27;s online store for a short period. Artists who participated in the first two &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; soundtracks also got their own copy. From July of that year, Jack in the Box restaurants offered six toys based on the movie as part of their kid&#x27;s meal menu: Punching Buttercup, Kung-Fu Bubbles, Karate Kick Blossom, Mojo Jojo&#x27;s Volcano Viewer, Bulging Brains Mojo Jojo, and Skyscraper Mo Mojo Jojo. In July 17, DC published the film&#x27;s official comic adaptation, written by Amy Rogers and illustrated by Phil Moy, Christopher Cook and Mike DeCarlo. Keebler, Dreyer&#x27;s, Mervyn&#x27;s, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Walmart, and the Got Milk? campaign were also commercial allies of the movie.

In August 2002, the MTR Corporation, which had previously used Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup as ambassadors in a campaign for subway safety in Hong Kong, promoted the film&#x27;s debut in the Chinese market by selling a set of commemorative Powerpuff Girls-themed tickets at their stations, which also came with a sticker, a movie ticket coupon and a rag doll keychain of one of the three girls.

== Release ==
A premiere screening was held by Warner Bros. in Century City, California on June 22, 2002, which a part of the film&#x27;s cast and crew attended, as well as celebrities such as Melissa Gilbert, Danny Bonaduce, Christine Lahti, Harry Hamlin, and Lisa Renee Foiles. In the United States, the film was rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for &quot;non-stop frenetic animated action&quot;. The film was released in theaters on July 3, 2002, accompanied by a G-rated &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; short titled &quot;Chicken Scratch&quot;, in which boy genius Dexter gets chickenpox and tries not to scratch to avoid turning into an actual chicken. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; later made its television debut on Cartoon Network on May 23, 2003.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on Region 1 VHS and DVD on November 5, 2002. The DVD included extras such as deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries. Despite being filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the DVD and VHS are in fullscreen only, much akin to that of the original series. The Region 2 DVD release presents the film in its original widescreen aspect ratio, but omits the audio commentary and bonus features, and is also in PAL format. As of 2024, the film has not been released on Blu-ray and digital. As of 2024, Max is the only place where the film is available to watch in High Definition on its original theatrical aspect ratio.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;It plays like an extended episode, but &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; is still lots of fun.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Bob Longino of the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; praised the film, saying that &quot;the intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizazz like a David Hockney scenescape&quot;, and that the script is both &quot;sinfully cynical and aw-shucks sweet&quot;. He also called it &quot;one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art.&quot; Nell Minow of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, saying that it &quot;may be a treat for the fans of the show, but its non-stop excitement and sense of humor is going to win over just about anyone&quot;. Virginia Heffernan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;the movie is cute [...] but its violent, snickering style is pure Americana&quot;, and that it evokes the &quot;outlandish classic&quot; look of McCracken&#x27;s inspirations. Ben Nuckols wrote for Associated Press that the protagonists&#x27; big eyes were the &quot;only remarkable thing&quot;, which he considered &quot;a shame, because the girls are delightful and the movie is skillfully made&quot;. &quot;New Sunday Times&quot; praised the animation, particularly the sequence where the Powerpuff Girls play tag, and said that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot to like about this movie&quot;, calling it &quot;a good first movie&quot;.

Jerry Beck wrote for Animation World Network that the film was &quot;good looking [...] but suffered from story problems&quot;, whereas Christene Meyers from &quot;Billings Gazette&quot; thought that the story could have been told in a few minutes. Contrarily, IGN&#x27;s KJB said that the movie did not &quot;overstay its welcome&quot; with its 70-minute running time and gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Dan Via, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said that &quot;even with its flaws, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; offers dramatic pacing, cleverness and charm that are hard to come by in the summertime multiplex&quot;, ranging from moments of &quot;epic stillness to the crash-bang-kapow flash of the action sequences&quot;. Mariano Kairuz, from the Argentine newspaper &quot;Página/12&quot;, wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s one of the happily bizarre cartoon movies to hit theaters in quite some time. One might even wonder how Cartoon Network and Warner authorized the multi-million dollar budget for something that looks and feels somewhat uncommercial&quot;.

Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film 3 and a half stars out of 5, describing it as &quot;retro fun that contains a serious self-empowerment message for little girls and little boys alike&quot;, as well as &quot;brilliant, wacky, and utterly charming fluff&quot;. In a review for the newspaper &quot;Riverfront Times&quot;, Gregory Weinkauf said that the film&#x27;s exploration of the girls&#x27; emotions during the asteroid scene was &quot;a brilliant sequence&quot; before the &quot;blaze of chaotic action&quot; in the third act. However, he was critical about the film&#x27;s &quot;bizarre anal sensibilities&quot; (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;cheeky shots of monkey butts — electroshocks slithering up into them, turd-bombs plopping out of them&quot;) and what he deemed as a &quot;psychosexual fodder&quot;, with the Mayor having a &quot;pickle fetish&quot; and Sara Bellum&#x27;s &quot;voluptuous curves [that] fill the frame but whose actual head and identity as a mature woman are curiously omitted.&quot;

The film also received some mild criticism for its violence, which some felt was too extreme for a family-oriented film, especially in the wake of the 9/11 attacks the previous year. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) gave the film a similarly negative review, labelling it as &quot;disturbing&quot;, further opining that the movie was nothing but a &quot;saturation of violent acts carried out with a fierce vengeance.&quot; In the 2009 documentary &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Who, What Where, How, Why... Who Cares?&quot;, McCracken said, &quot;In hindsight, maybe I wish it was a little sillier, a little more lighter, a little more... not so heavy the whole time.&quot; In 2016, he stated that due to the politics of the film&#x27;s production, he would stick to the television industry instead of branching out into movies.

=== Accolades ===
In early 2003, the Online Film Critics Society released its list of the Top 100 Animated Features of All Time, where &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; was placed at number 86. Later that year, the film was one of the several recipients of the Epic Award, as given by The White House Project to promote female leadership in the media. In 2019, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked the film number 72 on its list of the 100 best superhero movies of all time.

== Box office ==

&quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; premiered in theaters in the United States on July 3, 2002. Because of the popularity of the TV show, some analysts predicted that the film would gross $15 million over the Fourth of July weekend. However, Mekeisha Madden from &quot;The News Tribune&quot; noted that it was facing a strong competition against films like &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, as well as opening day competition with &quot;Men in Black II&quot; and &quot;Like Mike&quot;, commenting: &quot;The real question, according to some fans and industry experts, is if the movie is still timely. While the show is still hot with younger kids, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; reached its height in popularity with people over 14 in the summer of 2000&quot;.

The movie only earned $6.1 million over its first five days of release, ranking ninth at the North American box office due to competition with &quot;Men in Black II&quot;. Jim Samples, Cartoon Network&#x27;s general manager at the time, said that these numbers were a &quot;big disappointment&quot;, but still had hope that the movie would do better overseas and via DVD sales. He added that from then on the network would be more careful when choosing the release date of its original feature films. Brandon Gray, a Box Office Mojo contributor, asserted that &quot;at many of the venues the picture didn&#x27;t have evening showings, [thus] alienating many of the TV show&#x27;s older fans&quot;. By July 26, the film had dropped to No. 34 on the U.S. box office ranking. Ultimately, it grossed $11.4 million domestically and $5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $16.4 million with a $11 million budget. Mike Lazzo, former senior vice president of Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim, said that the movie flopped due to a bad combination of &quot;business&quot; (as for when and how it was released) and &quot;creative&quot; (with it being &quot;just good&quot; instead of &quot;genius&quot;). Screen Rant listed the movie as one of the 25 lowest-grossing superhero films at the global box office.

<text>The Lemon Squeezer is an unusual rock formation in Harriman State Park, New York. It is located at the intersection of the Appalachian Trail (White) and the Arden-Surebridge Trail (Red Triangle), near the base of Island Pond Mountain in the town of Tuxedo.

The trail initially passes under a large boulder resting on top of other rocks. After passing this point, the nature of the Lemon Squeezer becomes apparent as the hiker gets &quot;squeezed&quot; through a path that is high, wide, and angled 15 degrees. The trail then continues through additional rock formations where pine trees grow on top of a thin rock ceiling above the path.

The Lemon Squeezer was named by J. Ashton Allis, one of the founders and literal trailblazers of the Appalachian Trail, who in 1921 first scouted and marked the Arden-Surebridge Trail.

<text>Aloers (the word is originally Catalan) were independent peasant proprietors of &quot;alous&quot; in what is now Catalonia, especially during the years between the Carolingian reconquest of the Hispanic Marches from the Moors in the late 9th century and the consolidation of feudalism in that region in the 11th century. They generally practised family-based subsistence farming.

The owner of property in &quot;alou&quot; (from the Frankish &quot;alôd&quot; = full domain; cognate with allodial) was considered by medieval jurists to have &quot;no other lord than God&quot;.

Oranga Round Concrete Sheds

The side photograph includes one of the two hundred or so unique concrete sheds built around 1947 in the vicinity of Oranga, Onehunga, Auckland. While their blueprints are possibly lost to time we know they were constructed of a base, cylinder, and roof using wood forms that will have been reused to begin the build process anew after each pouring, also their parts may have been built off-site and then assembled on location. The ceiling view had the appearance of the form being constructed like a cheese segment style rotation that was then poured and mounted atop with a slight overhang or eave around the outside. A single circular indent system was used to hold the roof in place atop the cylinder. These handy out-buildings featured a door and window opposite (upper four louvre with lower pane), with a small drainage hole at the floor wall corner below, while above outside the roof had a designed-in circular shallow v-gutter around the outer edge making for simple rain channeling with a drainage dip off to one side for water run-off. The roof could not be walked upon as the studfinder shows little or no reinforcing. The interior walls had around six vertical equally spaced planks attached for holding tools. The walls were around two and a half inches thick for the cylinder, and three inches for the roof section, and three for the base which sat in-line with the cylinder, Their large internal space measuring eight feet across the floor and seven feet to the apex above meant they could be used as a place for storage and or dispatching fowl back in the day. Slight banding and nail head indents can be seen around the exterior and interior walls where the wood forms had been erected for pouring day. The exterior was given a simple white coating.

<doc id="1167269" wikidata="Q3142278" url="?curid=1167269" title="Wave Race 64">
<text>is a 1996 racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It is the second entry in the &quot;Wave Race&quot; series following the 1992 Game Boy game &quot;Wave Race&quot;. Gameplay involves the player racing on a personal watercraft on a variety of courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another. The game is presented in a letterboxed 14:9 aspect ratio.

Originally referred to as &quot;&quot;F-Zero&quot; on water&quot;, the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities, but these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; received acclaim from critics, who praised the game&#x27;s satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited with helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 3D capabilities. It was re-released for the Wii and Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, respectively, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022. A sequel, &quot;Wave Race: Blue Storm&quot;, was released for the GameCube in 2001.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Wave Race 64&quot; is a racing video game in which players race on personal watercrafts in different weather conditions and on a variety of courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert and Reverse, the latter being Expert with the tracks oriented backwards. Hard, Expert, and Reverse must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.

While racing opponents, the player must successfully manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There are two types of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game&#x27;s HUD will light, allowing the player&#x27;s watercraft to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player&#x27;s accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys over the course of a race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.

In Time Trials, the player can freely race on a course to perform the best times, which are recorded in the game&#x27;s data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, as well as the class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.

==Development and release==
&quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was developed by Nintendo EAD and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto as one of the first Nintendo 64 games. Development of the game was led by Shinya Takahashi, who had been working with Nintendo since 1989. Takahashi, along with Yoshiaki Koizumi, who worked with Miyamoto on &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, are credited for helping the company effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 3D capabilities. Since the game&#x27;s engineers only had experience with the 2D graphics of earlier Nintendo consoles, Takahashi had to guide them through the first stages of development. While experimenting with the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Silicon Graphics technology, one of the programmers created a tech demo that served as an example of the game&#x27;s wave programming. The tech demo caught the attention of Miyamoto, and soon the team began to figure out a way to create &quot;something fun&quot; from it.

Originally, the game was referred to as &quot;&quot;F-Zero&quot; on water&quot; and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo Shoshinkai show. The boats were planned to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form to a more streamlined canoe-style version. However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis at the suggestion of Rare&#x27;s Tim Stamper. Miyamoto explained that &quot;boats looked pretty good at the show, but I didn&#x27;t think that &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; would be unique from similar games on other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;&quot;. The game uses the Nintendo 64&#x27;s alpha blending feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective. 

&quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was promoted with a marketing campaign that cost $4 million. It was first released in Japan in September 1996 on an 8-MB cartridge. In the United States, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was released as the third Nintendo 64 game on November 4, 1996, featuring voice changes and renamed levels. It was the first racing game developed for the Nintendo 64 and the first to use the Nintendo 64&#x27;s hardware capabilities to &quot;create a believable and engaging water environment unmatched by previous games&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the game was released in April 1997, shortly after the launch of the Nintendo 64. Like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was re-issued in Japan in July 1997 as . This version takes advantage of the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak and adds ghost functions to the game&#x27;s time trial mode, in the form of a dolphin that races against the player and represents the previous best time on the course. Some music and sound effects were altered as well.

==Reception==
&quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 154,000 units in Japan by December 1996 and more than one million units in the United States by December 1997. As of December 2007, the game had sold 1.95 million copies in the United States. Globally, the game sold 2.95 million units, making it the best selling Wave Race game of all time, and 14th best selling Nintendo 64 game. At the time of its release, some reviewers considered it to be one of the greatest racing games of all time on a home console. &quot;GamePro&quot; described &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; as a &quot;phenomenally fun&quot; racing game that captivates players with its deep and challenging gameplay, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; regarded it as one of the first quality titles released for the Nintendo 64, along with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;.

Graphically, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was praised for its fluid animations, realistic physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Doug Perry commented that the jetskis in the game provide believable and spectacular experience. Writing for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;, Victor Lucas highlighted the game&#x27;s distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something to get excited about. He also gave high marks to the game&#x27;s satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but felt the music was shallow. &quot;GamePro&quot; agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer&#x27;s voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame&#x27;s Jonti Davies felt that the game&#x27;s &quot;cheesy&quot; and &quot;distinctly &#x27;80s theme&quot; soundtrack combined with the announcer&#x27;s &quot;hyperexcited cries&quot; gives the game a light and arcade feel.

&quot;N64 Magazine&quot; journalists described &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; as &quot;one of the deepest racing games&quot; they had played, stating that the game&#x27;s dynamic waves &quot;constantly tests and re-tests&quot; the player&#x27;s control and that the buoys system offers tactical decisions about whether to spend time taking a wide corner or dash straight on to catch the leader before it&#x27;s too late. Similarly, &quot;Game Informer&quot; remarked that the waves can strike players on every turn and that one mistake can mean the difference between victory and defeat. &quot;Edge&quot; highly praised the game&#x27;s believable watery environments and satisfying controls, stating that each of the game&#x27;s four crafts feature different handling characteristics, which is accentuated by the way they interact with the water. Although the magazine criticized the game&#x27;s lack of courses, noting that most of them can be seen in a day&#x27;s play, it ultimately concluded that &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; is an example of how Nintendo&#x27;s approach to game design still remains markedly different from almost every other videogames company in the world.

The controls were generally praised, although Todd Mowatt of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) noted that getting used to them can take some time. Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot also praised the controls, stating that &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; &quot;makes the best use yet&quot; of the Nintendo 64 analog stick. Although he highlighted the multiplayer mode for offering a &quot;fairly good competition&quot;, he criticized its small split-screen play areas for detracting from the drama. Alex Huhtala of &quot;CVG&quot; felt that the game was too short, but admitted that the multiplayer and stunt modes give the game longevity. In March 1997, &quot;EGM&quot; editors named &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; their Sports Game of the Year and a runner-up for their Nintendo 64 Game of the Year award (behind &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;), citing the realistic physics and variety of tracks.

==Legacy==
After its release on the Nintendo 64, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; has been included in several top lists. In 1997, &quot;EGM&quot; ranked the game 68th on its list of 100 Best Games of All Time. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it 20th on a similar list, commenting that &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;, along with &quot;Mario 64&quot;, demonstrated more graphical power for the system. &quot;IGN&quot; editors ranked it 33rd on their 2003 list of Top 100 Games of All Time, and 37th on another list published in 2005. They remarked that &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; incorporated water physics into racing unlike any game before it, or any since. The simple concept of racing on jet skis was complicated by changing wave patterns, swells, and rising tides, and Nintendo added its trademark depth to broaden and deepen the unique racer. In 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; placed &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; at 127th in its &quot;Top 200&quot; games list. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 49th on a list of greatest Nintendo games of all time. A sequel, &quot;Wave Race: Blue Storm&quot;, was released in 2001.

&quot;Wave Race 64&quot; was released in China for the iQue Player console in 2003. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. When the game was released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on August 19, 2022, once again with the Kawasaki banners restored. These digital re-releases of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game to be just as much fun as it was on the Nintendo 64.

Codemasters producer Guy Wilday cited &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; as a key influence in the design of their 1998 racing game &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot;. According to Wilday, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; is &quot;a fine example of a game with realistic physics and an incredibly well balanced control system. The game is easy to pick up and play but it is only after playing it for some time that you start to understand the additional nuances of the controls. Initially it&#x27;s just about going left or right, but later you start to use the weight of the rider to fine-tune the movement of the jetski in the corners and over the waves. I loved the fact that this game was easily accessible but had that greater depth for more hardcore players—this was a key design goal for [&quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot;]&quot;.
