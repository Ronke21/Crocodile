<text>Richard Edgar &quot;Rick&quot; Castle (born Richard Alexander Rodgers) is a fictional character on the ABC crime series &quot;Castle&quot;. He is portrayed by Nathan Fillion.

The name Richard Castle is also used as a pseudonym under which a set of real books about the characters Derrick Storm and Nikki Heat, based on the books mentioned in the television series, are written. These books have achieved success, becoming &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers. Actor Nathan Fillion appears as the face of Richard Castle on the books and on the official website, and participates in book signings. The &quot;Castle&quot; book series was actually written/ghost-written by screenwriter Tom Straw.

==Creation and development==
According to Fillion, the character&#x27;s name &quot;Rick Castle&quot; was noted by the show creator as sounding like &quot;Rich Asshole&quot; and says that this reflects his character. He describes Castle as being &quot;a bit of a douche&quot; with a Peter Pan syndrome stemming from a lack of a &quot;real male adult role model in his life&quot;.

Andrew Marlowe explained that he designed Castle&#x27;s character as one that presents a &quot;storytelling point of view&quot; as a counterpoint to Beckett&#x27;s evidence-based police work. On casting Fillion to fill the role, Marlowe described &quot;Castle&quot; as &quot;the right vehicle for the right personality&quot;. He also acknowledged the similarity between the Castle/Beckett relationship and the Booth/Brennan relationship of &quot;Bones&quot;.

==Character overview==

===Family life===
Castle is the father of Alexis Castle and the son of Martha Rodgers, both of whom live with him. His father is a CIA operative who has used the aliases &quot;Jackson Hunt&quot; and &quot;Anderson Cross&quot;. Castle&#x27;s birth name is Richard Alexander Rodgers; he uses Richard Edgar Castle as his &quot;nom de plume&quot;, (Edgar in honor of Edgar Allan Poe, though he still considers Alexander his middle name). Fillion describes the family dynamic as unconventional because &quot;Castle is very much mothered by his 15-year-old daughter, and at the same time he turns around and mothers his own mother.&quot;

As a child, he never knew who his father was. He reasoned that he never missed having a father as he never had anything to miss, and it allowed him to imagine that his father could be anyone he wished. He was looked after by a nanny who spent most of her time watching daytime television. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was the inspiration to write his first novel. He was further inspired to become a writer when a man (later revealed to be the father he never knew) handed him a copy of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; at the New York Public Library when he was ten years old. He also claims to have been kicked out of all of New York&#x27;s finer academic institutions at least once, and to have picked up speed reading while spending his days as a child in the New York Public Library.

Castle has been married and divorced twice. His first wife was Alexis&#x27;s mother, Meredith (Darby Stanchfield), an impulsive, free-spirited actress, and red-haired like her daughter. She and Richard occasionally meet for a sexual liaison, causing Richard to refer to her metaphorically as a &quot;deep-fried twinkie&quot; (something that is a treat on occasion, but to have it every day would kill you) when she contemplated moving back to New York. His second wife was Gina Cowell (Monet Mazur), his publisher, a role she continues after their divorce. Castle and Gina became involved again, briefly, when she spent a summer with him in the Hamptons supervising his second Nikki Heat novel, but they soon ended their relationship.

Castle has sole custody of his daughter, Alexis. As a result of his own experiences being raised by a nanny, he insisted on raising her himself, made easier by the fact that he works from his large loft apartment shared with his mother. Alexis sometimes seems more mature and responsible than her father, parenting &quot;him&quot;. Richard takes great care of her, but also likes to play with her.

Castle also plays regular poker games with fellow authors James Patterson, Stephen J. Cannell, Michael Connelly, and Dennis Lehane. When Cannell died in 2010, a fictional mystery writer was invited by Castle to the game, but a seat was left empty in their friend&#x27;s honor. He also mentions being friends with Jonathan Kellerman, Wes Craven, and Stephen King.

In the fifth season, Castle finally meets his father (portrayed by James Brolin), whom he learns is a spy when he helps him rescue Alexis when she was kidnapped. A Russian enemy of Castle&#x27;s father seeks revenge for the Russian&#x27;s murdered wife, so he kidnaps Alexis to lure him out. His father has been checking in on him, his mom, and Alexis their whole lives.

At the end of the final fifth-season episode, Castle proposes marriage to Beckett just as she prepares to reveal her decision on a Washington, DC job offer. The episode ends before she answers. At the beginning of the first sixth-season episode, &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, Kate accepts.
They are finally married during the seventh season in a private wedding with their family, taking place at Castle&#x27;s house in the Hamptons.

In the eighth and final season, Beckett estranges herself from Castle in order to protect him from LokSat, a deadly mastermind whom she&#x27;s after, although they are married still and very much in love. Beckett starts living elsewhere, not letting Castle know about LokSat. After the events of &quot;Mr. And Mrs. Castle&quot; they get back together. Alexis becomes Castle&#x27;s main helping hand in his P.I. agency. In the series finale, a flash forward to seven years later shows Castle and Beckett are the parents of three children.

===Writing career===
Early episodes of the series had Castle voicing over the introductory credits beginning with Season 2.

&quot;There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking how to kill people: Psychopaths, and mystery writers. I&#x27;m the kind that pays better. Who am I? I&#x27;m Rick Castle... Every writer needs inspiration, and I found mine.&quot;&quot; [Det. Kate Beckett as Nikki Heat] &quot;And thanks to my friendship with the mayor, I get to be on her case... And together, we catch killers.&quot;

Castle is an author of mystery fiction, with 26 bestsellers. His first novel, &quot;In a Hail of Bullets&quot;, accrued at least 21 rejections before being accepted by a publisher (he keeps the first rejection letter he received framed on his office wall as motivation) and winning the Nom DePlume Society&#x27;s Tom Straw Award for Mystery Literature. The books have made Castle wealthy; when Alexis is kidnapped he can pay a $3 million ransom. Castle has a large multi-floor Manhattan apartment, a beachfront house in the Hamptons, and luxury cars.

His most popular works are a series starring &quot;Derrick Storm&quot;; &quot;A Calm Before The Storm&quot;, &quot;Gathering Storm&quot;, &quot;Unholy Storm&quot;, &quot;Storm&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, &quot;Storm Season&quot;, &quot;Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, and &quot;Storm&#x27;s Break&quot; and in the pilot episode, Castle attends a party for the release of the final book in the Storm series, &quot;Stormfall&quot;, which ends with the surprise death of Derrick Storm, Castle having become bored with the character. He later reads from the novel before a book-signing. Patterson and Cannell both disagree with the decision to kill off Storm, with Cannell commenting that he could have retired or crippled Storm instead, so that he could revisit the character if he changed his mind.

His other books include &quot;Death of a Prom Queen&quot;, &quot;Flowers For Your Grave&quot;, &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;, &quot;A Skull at Springtime&quot;, &quot;At Dusk We Die&quot;, &quot;When It Comes to Slaughter&quot;, and &quot;A Rose for Everafter&quot;. By his own admission, his early works—&quot;Death of a Prom Queen&quot;, &quot;Flowers For Your Grave&quot;, and &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;—are of poor quality; he points to &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; in particular, with its plotline of &quot;angry Wiccans out for blood&quot; as being a low point in his career.

After using his friendship with the Mayor to get partnered with NYPD detective Kate Beckett under the pretense of conducting research for a new character, Castle plans a new series of novels starring a new character, a detective based on Beckett. He soon names Beckett&#x27;s literary alter-ego &quot;Nikki Heat&quot;, much to her embarrassment. Beckett takes umbrage at the name, regarding it a &quot;stripper name&quot;, and insists that Castle change it, despite his proposing the book titles &quot;Summer Heat&quot;, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, and &quot;In Heat&quot;. Ultimately, he sticks with the name, and the first novel in the series, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, is released to much critical acclaim and financial success. Castle is offered a lucrative contract for three more Nikki Heat novels, with talk in the third season of a movie adaptation. The title of his second Nikki Heat novel, &quot;Naked Heat&quot;, once again displeases Beckett.

It has been suggested that Castle&#x27;s interest in death, murder, and the macabre may be the result of a childhood trauma. When Beckett confronts him about it, Castle avoids the question. However, as soon as he tells the story, he admits it is fictional and that it&#x27;s &quot;[his] job to make stuff up&quot;. Later, he admits to his daughter that one of the reasons he writes is to try to understand how criminals could do the things they do. He was under consideration for a deal to write three novels revolving around an unnamed British spy (implied to be James Bond) but rejected the offer, allegedly because his publisher wanted three more Nikki Heat novels and offered him more money, but secretly because accepting would have ended his collaboration with Beckett. In &quot;Hollander&#x27;s Woods&quot;, the source of Castle&#x27;s interest in murder writing is revealed: in 1983, when he was 11, he found a murdered girl and was confronted by her killer who let him go. The girl&#x27;s body was never found and she was never identified so no one believed his story. According to Castle, this encounter is what causes him to do what he does: he never was able to solve the mystery of what happened to him in the woods that day so he&#x27;s driven to solve all the other mysteries he can. In the present of the episode, Castle is confronted by a similar case and finally gets to learn the truth of what happened that day and personally stop a serial killer of an unknown, but presumably large, number of murdered women.

Castle is something of a &quot;method writer&quot;, endlessly researching his subjects and acquiring new skills to put himself in the mind of his characters. Amongst the useful skills Castle (and to some extent, partner-in-crime Alexis) have acquired are lock picking, safe cracking, fencing, and a basic grounding in forensic science and criminal psychology. Because he&#x27;s a writer, although he notoriously shirks &quot;boring paperwork,&quot; his ability to speed-read allows him to sift through information faster than most of the precinct (a skill Gates puts to use when hunting for a bomber) and he retains almost everything he reads, especially when it comes to case files (making him the closest approximation to an expert when Jerry Tyson, aka 3XK, returns in Season 7 after stealing his entire case file in Season 6). He also has researched crimes and serial killers, such as the original crime spree of serial killer Jerry Tyson aka The Triple Killer or 3XK for &quot;When It Comes to Slaughter&quot;. In the pilot episode, &quot;Flowers For Your Grave&quot;, Castle displays an uncanny knack for behavioral observation when he observes Beckett and is able to accurately profile her, to which a visibly shaken Beckett responds, &quot;Cute trick.&quot;

Kyra Blaine, an ex-girlfriend of Castle to whom he dedicated &quot;A Rose for Everafter&quot;, told Beckett that Castle only dedicates his books to people he truly cares about.

In &quot;Hollander&#x27;s Woods&quot;, Castle is awarded the Poe&#x27;s Pen Achievement Award which he says is the highest award a mystery writer can receive. Although shaken by an encounter with the serial killer who inspired his writing interest, Castle accepts the award and dedicates it to his family and friends as he recognizes that, without them, he wouldn&#x27;t have won it.

===Police consulting===
In the pilot episode of &quot;Castle&quot;, Castle is consulted by Detective Beckett of the NYPD when two victims are murdered in the style of two deaths portrayed in his novels, &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; and &quot;Flowers for Your Grave&quot; respectively. Though Beckett wants Castle&#x27;s access to the case limited, Castle repeatedly defies her instructions in order to see the handiwork of his copycat. Unsatisfied with what he considers a boring resolution to the case, Castle convinces Beckett to continue the investigation, and winds up discovering deeper layers to the crime. While the murders initially appeared to have been committed by the mentally ill client of a social worker who was one of the victims, Castle notes that the murderer did not duplicate the crimes exactly, eliminating the possibility that he was a deranged fan. He realizes that the killer was actually the social worker&#x27;s brother attempting to frame her client, so that he could inherit his father&#x27;s money after his death (his father suffering from terminal cancer). By the end of the pilot, Castle enters into a working relationship with Beckett under the pretense of conducting research for his new series of &quot;Nikki Heat&quot; novels.

This relationship is often strained by Castle&#x27;s luck in personally encountering the suspects, and sneaking in behind breaching teams even after Beckett has ordered him to remain behind; his attempts to follow them once allowing a suspect a chance to escape (although in Castle&#x27;s defense this was merely because his ex-wife called him on his cell phone during the stake-out rather than any mistakes on his part). Despite this, Castle&#x27;s familiarity with numerous obscure subjects often gives breakthroughs. His career yields many contacts, including a CIA agent willing to break Agency protocol by telling Castle and Beckett that their current victim was not a CIA agent.

Although he is a proficient marksman (secret until Beckett bets with him on the practice range), he works the cases wholly unarmed (with a few rare, isolated exceptions). While his status as a consultant generally allows him to participate in the &#x27;fun&#x27; parts of detective work without worrying about the more tedious details such as paperwork, the team puts him in situations where the criminals request no police involvement, such as to drop off a ransom. Castle still requires official police authority to request information from various sources, and can only question witnesses under supervision.

Beckett often steps in to stop him becoming carried away with wild theories that threaten to obscure the facts. He once speculated that a surgeon had been killed for his involvement in an organ-smuggling ring before they discovered that he was wanted for plastic surgery he had performed for someone in witness protection. Castle&#x27;s writing career has given him a knack for noting minor details in the situations they investigate, such as when he noted that rent for a victim&#x27;s apartment had been paid for &quot;after&quot; her death.

Initially portrayed as jocular and immature, such as having a bulletproof vest made up for himself that says &quot;WRITER&quot; rather than &quot;POLICE&quot;, Castle&#x27;s character deepens as the series progresses. In &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; (S02 E13), while attempting to catch the killer responsible for the death of Beckett&#x27;s mother over a decade ago, Castle willingly donates $100,000 of his own money for a fake hit, to lure out the killer. He then offers to terminate his partnership with Beckett after she was forced to shoot the real killer, revealed to be a contract assassin silent about his employer. Beckett rejects the offer on the grounds that Castle makes her hard job more fun.

In season 3 &quot;Nikki Heat&quot; (S03 E11), Castle is upset when B-movie actress Natalie Rhodes (Laura Prepon) is cast as Nikki, thinking she is not right for the role. When Rhodes comes onto a case to observe Beckett, Castle is further insulted that she has not read the actual book. Rhodes considers him unimportant to the film and Beckett likes having Natalie around. However, as the case goes on, Rhodes begins to copy Beckett&#x27;s mannerisms and outfits, complete with brunette wig, annoying Beckett while Castle begins to like her more. At one point, Rhodes kisses Castle, making it clear she wants to sleep with him to feel the character more but Castle turns her down, telling Beckett that sleeping with the actress playing the fictional version of her is &quot;way too meta&quot;.

In &quot;Knockdown&quot; (S03 E13), Castle helps Beckett in catching her mother&#x27;s killer. When Martha points out that he has written 22 books before meeting Beckett but he did not have to go to a police station every day, Castle replied by saying that it is not about the books anymore. Castle and Beckett finally kiss as a ploy to distract a guard, although their reactions imply that they both felt something.

Since then, despite Beckett&#x27;s then current relationship with another man, they begin spending increasing amounts of time together, with Castle even admitting he is jealous when Beckett agrees to help another writer with his book. In the final episode of Season 3, &quot;Knockout&quot; (S03 E24), Castle finally admits his feelings to Beckett, who is apparently unconscious after being shot while delivering a eulogy at Roy Montgomery&#x27;s funeral after Montgomery sacrificed himself to atone for his role in the death of Beckett&#x27;s mother. She claims amnesia after she has recovered from the shooting, refusing the possibility of a relationship while her mother&#x27;s real killer still walks free.

In season 4, Castle is contacted by a shadowy figure who says that he is a friend of Roy Montgomery and that he has been charged with protecting Beckett in his stead. Castle learns that Montgomery knew who ordered Beckett&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death; he had been the one who found out about the kidnappings and offered not to go to the police if Montgomery, Raglan and MacAllister gave him the money they made from the ransoms which has been estimated at several millions of dollars. According to the man, this person has grown powerful enough for the revelation to destroy him. Montgomery had kept files that, should they be revealed would harm the killer and others. The deal was that Montgomery&#x27;s family and Beckett would be safe if he wanted the files kept secret. Upon his death, he had sent the files to the mysterious man and had charged him with upholding the deal. The only other condition was that Beckett couldn&#x27;t go near the case or else the deal was off. Castle says that he will keep her reined in. He tells only his mother this information and confides in her as to the deal he made. Martha wants Castle to tell Beckett the truth, but Castle tells her that he can&#x27;t because Beckett will be killed by the people behind her mother&#x27;s murder if she keeps digging and that he has to protect her.

In &#x27;Dial M for Mayor&#x27; (S04 E12), a mysterious conspiracy is uncovered that was attempting to force Mayor Weldon, Castle&#x27;s close friend, out of office. The attempt to smear him for embezzlement backfired when a young woman named Laura Cambridge discovered the fact and she was killed. During the case, the mysterious man once again contacts Castle and asks to meet. When they do, he helps him solve the case. However, he later reveals that the conspiracy aimed at the Mayor would have forced Castle out of the 12th Precinct because no one would force Captain Gates to retain him. The man said that they needed Castle to remain at Beckett&#x27;s side because he was the only one able to keep her away from her mother&#x27;s case. Castle promises that he will uphold his end of the deal to keep Beckett away from the case.

In &quot;Pandora&quot; (S04 E15) and Linchpin&quot; (S04 E16), the investigation of a murder leads Castle and Beckett to reunite with Sophia Turner (Jennifer Beals), a CIA operative on whom he based a major character. Beckett shows some jealousy at how the two are close and Turner tells Beckett that after she and Rick became involved, it was the beginning of the end of their partnership. The trio work together to stop a plot that could escalate into World War III. However, Sophia turns out to not only be part of the plot but is actually a KGB mole who infiltrated the CIA only to be left on her own when the Soviet Union collapsed. Holding Beckett and Castle at gunpoint, she hints that Castle&#x27;s father was in the CIA and that was why he gained access years ago. She is killed by a true CIA agent as Beckett and Castle help stop the plot. While mourning Sophia, Castle admits to Beckett that she was much truer to the character he created.

In &quot;47 Seconds&quot; (S04 E19), Beckett reveals to a suspect that she remembered every second of being shot, not realizing that Castle was watching behind the one-way glass mirror. As a result, although Castle tried to hide it, he started to become distant with her, much to Beckett&#x27;s confusion, concluding that she never mentioned her memory of the event because she didn&#x27;t return his feelings and didn&#x27;t want to create an awkward situation.

In the season 4 finale, Castle is concerned when a murder case is connected to the conspiracy behind Beckett&#x27;s mother and is told by the mystery man that Beckett&#x27;s life is in danger if she investigates. After failing to warn her off subtly, Castle confesses to Beckett how he&#x27;s been protecting her and she is outraged over his making decisions for her. He confronts her over how he knows she remembers his declaration of love and they both decide they&#x27;re done. After nearly dying in a confrontation with the killer and quitting the police force, Beckett comes to Castle&#x27;s apartment, telling him she could only think of him while on the verge of death and then they later kiss passionately.

The thread of their relationship continues in Season 5, with Castle and Beckett trying (and mostly failing) to conceal their relationship from their co-workers – not simply because of office gossip, but the threat of a misconduct charge being levied by the ever-watchful Captain Gates. In the episode, &quot;Murder, He Wrote&quot; (S05 E04), Ryan accidentally stumbles on the truth while interrogating a suspect, but chooses to keep the truth to himself and respect their privacy. Lanie and Esposito learn the truth in the following episode when Castle was framed for murder (Ryan told Esposito and Beckett told Lanie so that they were aware of the fact that their background research would expose Castle&#x27;s contact with Beckett outside of case-related matters). In the Season 5 episode &quot;Still&quot; (S05 E22), Captain Gates reveals that she has known about the relationship and has kept quiet since to maintain &quot;plausible deniability&quot;, i.e. she cannot report the relationship because she hasn&#x27;t personally witnessed any behavior to suggest a relationship and is happy to keep up the plausible deniability so long as the pair remain professional on the job.

In the season six episode &quot;Veritas&quot; (S06 E22), after Beckett is framed for murder by the man who had ordered the death of her mother, Castle works to protect her. They are eventually able to clear her name and as a bonus, finally arrest the man Beckett had been after for so long, using hidden evidence Roy Montgomery had left Johanna Beckett.

In episode eleven of season 7, Castle is ordered to leave the NYPD due to co-operating with a mafia don to prove the innocence of one of his underlings suspected of murder, leading to the true murderer being assassinated.

After being restored to his position in the police department, Castle is finally able to bring down old enemy Jerry Tyson, aka serial killer 3XK during &quot;Resurrection&quot; (S07 E14) and &quot;Reckoning&quot; (S07 E15).

In the season seven finale, &quot;Hollander&#x27;s Woods&quot; (S07 E23), Castle is confronted with his past when a murder surfaces that matches one he saw in his youth. The murder he&#x27;d witnessed had been his inspiration to write as because he was never able finish the story of what had happened in the woods when he was a kid, he became driven to finish all the other stories he could find. The investigation leads them to discover a serial killer who has been operating for at least thirty years with an unknown number of victims, all people who won&#x27;t be missed. The investigation leads them to the identity of the girl Castle saw murdered and a showdown between Castle and the killer after he breaks into the man&#x27;s barn in search of evidence. Castle is forced to fatally shoot the killer in self-defense with Beckett&#x27;s gun and brings closure to his victims though the incident leaves him shaken.

===Private investigator===
After being banned from the 12th Precinct (S07 E11), Castle completed online courses and became a fully licensed private investigator, hoping that he could still work with the department by conducting his own investigations rather than as part of theirs, but was informed that this planned loophole wouldn&#x27;t work as he still wasn&#x27;t allowed to directly come in contact with evidence. He continued to operate as a P.I., but soon found himself dissatisfied with the role, as he was mainly hired for minor cases or people viewing his new career as a &#x27;gimmick&#x27; rather than a serious profession; one case saw him hired by someone who wanted him to act as a fake witness to her plans to fake her own death. However, after rescuing Beckett from his old nemesis the Triple Killer, Captain Gates eventually re-hired Castle as a consultant for the 12th precinct-&#x27;officially&#x27; designating it as community service for interfering in an active case-also reinstating him as Beckett&#x27;s partner.

After Gates and Beckett are promoted so that Beckett is now captain of the 12th precinct, Castle re-opens Richard Castle Investigations (his private investigator&#x27;s office) to allow him to take part in investigations due to Beckett&#x27;s more deskbound role.

====&quot;Nikki Heat&quot; fictional characters====
* Detective Nikki Heat is loosely based on NYPD detective Kate Beckett, with a similar backstory. Her decision to become a detective was motivated by the death of someone close to her – although Heat has a niece and siblings that Beckett lacks – and the first case she investigates is adapted from several real cases Castle helped Beckett solve. Heat is assisted by sometimes-lover journalist Jameson Rook, and colleagues, Detectives Raley and Ochoa. Originally a theater major at Northeastern University, Nikki switched her major to criminal justice after her mother&#x27;s murder. She is a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and often spars with Don, her Navy SEAL combat trainer-with-benefits until his murder in &quot;Frozen Heat&quot;. Nikki carries the NYPD-issue SIG-Sauer P226 DAO as her duty weapon (unlike Beckett, who uses the Glock 19). She lives at an apartment in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of Manhattan. At the end of &quot;Raging Heat&quot;, Rook proposes, and the two are married in the epilogue of &quot;Driving Heat&quot; by their friend and frequent poker buddy, Judge Horace Simpson. In &quot;Frozen Heat&quot;, Nikki learns that her murdered mother, Cynthia Heat (née Trope), was a CIA agent who worked as a piano tutor for the children of various foreign nationals, and that she was murdered because she had uncovered a terrorist plot. After ten years, Nikki was able to close the case and bring her mother&#x27;s killer to justice. Although Nikki passes the Lieutenant&#x27;s exam with flying colors in &quot;Heat Rises&quot;, she declines the promotion in order to remain a homicide detective. She is promoted to captain of the 20th Precinct in &quot;Raging Heat&quot; after the death of Captain Wallace Irons. Although she had a little bit of a rough start as Precinct Commander in &quot;Driving Heat&quot;, Nikki eventually finds her footing. It is mentioned in &quot;High Heat&quot; that Nikki has spent her entire career at the 20th, first as a rookie beat cop, then as a patrol sergeant, followed by detective and detective squad leader, and culminating in her current rank as captain. Nikki and Rook also made a cameo appearance in Richard Castle&#x27;s Derrick Storm novel, &quot;Storm Front&quot;, where they interviewed Storm after he was detained by the NYPD for being in the room with a dead body. After the events of &quot;High Heat&quot;, Nikki is offered the position of Director of Homeland Security by Presidential candidate Senator Lindsy Gardner, a position she is highly encouraged to accept by the Commissioner and Zach Hamner. She also works alongside Derrick Storm to unravel the mystery of why her mother actually faked her own death in 1999.
* Jameson Alexander Rook is a fictional character Richard Castle created for his Nikki Heat series of crime novels. He is a famous two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning magazine journalist who shadows the main character, Detective Nikki Heat, and is her on-again off-again love interest. He was shot by a dirty cop in &quot;Heat Rises&quot; and spent the beginning of the next novel, &quot;Frozen Heat&quot;, recovering. He proposes to her at the end of &quot;Raging Heat&quot;, and the two are married in the epilogue of &quot;Driving Heat&quot; by their friend and frequent poker buddy, Judge Horace Simpson. The character moonlights as a romance novelist under the pen name Victoria St. Clair. He is based on Castle himself and the way he works with Kate Beckett. Rook and Heat also made a cameo appearance in Richard Castle&#x27;s Derrick Storm novel, &quot;Storm Front&quot;, where they interviewed Storm after he was detained by the NYPD for being in the room with a dead body. Both Rook and Storm noted each other&#x27;s rugged handsomeness.
* Captain Charles Montrose is the captain of the 20th Precinct, based on Captain Montgomery. Prior to taking command of the 20th Precinct, he worked as a homicide detective at the 41st Precinct in the Bronx. He is a widower; his wife, Pauletta, was killed by a drunk driver while crossing the street. Captain Montrose was murdered in &quot;Heat Rises&quot;, and after Det. Heat proved it wasn&#x27;t a suicide, he was given a funeral with full honors.
* Detective Miguel Ochoa is based on Detective Esposito. While working with Raley, their nickname is &quot;Roach&quot;. After Det. Heat&#x27;s promotion to captain, she names Ochoa and Raley co-lead detectives of the 20th Detective Squad.
* Detective Sean Raley is based on Detective Ryan, and is coined &quot;King of All Surveillance Media&quot; by Det. Heat. While working with Ochoa, their nickname is &quot;Roach&quot;. After Det. Heat&#x27;s promotion to captain, she names Raley and Ochoa co-lead detectives of the 20th Detective Squad.
* Dr. Lauren Parry is a medical examiner with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York and one of Det. Heat&#x27;s closest friends, based on Dr. Lanie Parish.
* Margaret Rook is Jameson Rook&#x27;s mother, based on Richard Castle&#x27;s own mother Martha Rodgers. Margaret is a 60-something-year-old Tony Award-winning Broadway diva.
* Detective Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Feller is a member of the NYPD Taxi Squad in &quot;Heat Rises&quot;. He transferred to Det. Heat&#x27;s homicide team before the events of &quot;Frozen Heat&quot;.
* Detective Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Rhymer is a former military policeman from the Carolinas, nicknamed &quot;Opie&quot;, who now works in the burglary division of the 20th Precinct. Det. Heat often borrows him for high-profile investigations to the point where he eventually became a full-time member of the squad.
* Detective Inez Aguinaldo, a member of the Southampton Police Department who assisted Det. Heat during the events of &quot;Raging Heat&quot;. She transferred to the NYPD&#x27;s 20th Precinct in &quot;Driving Heat&quot; after Heat was promoted to captain.
* Detective Benigno DeJesus is the lead member of the 20th Precinct&#x27;s Evidence Collection Team and a valued colleague of Det. Heat.
* Zach Hamner, aka &quot;the Hammer&quot;, is the Senior Administrative Aide to the Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters. A powerful member of the NYPD, Hamner felt personally snubbed by Det. Heat when she turned down the promotion to lieutenant. He has since become 1PP&#x27;s point man when it comes to Capt. Heat and her precinct. In &quot;Heat Storm&quot;, he strongly urges Capt. Heat to accept Presidential candidate Lindsy Gardner&#x27;s offer to become Director of Homeland Security in anticipation of all the federal assistance she could provide the NYPD with in that position.
* Captain Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Irons, first introduced in &quot;Heat Rises&quot; is an administrator and bureaucrat who took command of the 20th Precinct after the death of Captain Montrose. He was not very well-liked or respected by Det. Heat, especially after he began sleeping with precinct Detective Sharon Hinesburg, and is constantly about looking good to the public and the NYPD brass. He was killed in an explosion in &quot;Raging Heat&quot;, prompting Heat to succeed him as precinct commander. The character is a parody of Capt. Victoria &#x27;Iron&#x27; Gates from the series.
* Detectives Malcolm and Reynolds, first introduced in &quot;Naked Heat &quot;. On loan from Burglary Division, they are considered to be as formidable a team as Raley and Ochoa. Their names are taken from the character played by Nathan Fillion in the TV show &quot;Firefly&quot;.
* Senator Lindsy Gardner, a librarian-turned-politician who ran for President of the United States in 2016 against Republican Caleb Brown and Independent Legs Kline. During her campaign, she asked Capt. Nikki Heat to serve in her Cabinet as Director of Homeland Security.

===&quot;Mystery&quot; of the Castle ghost writer===
The ABC network was able to successfully conceal the true identity of the ghost-writer of the &quot;Castle&quot; book series throughout the eight years of the program&#x27;s production from 2009 through 2016, allowing the mystery of the true identity of this individual to then remain as an intriguing part of the over-all &quot;Castle myth&quot;. In 2010, the hint was dropped, when the &quot;Nom de Plume Society&quot;, and the &quot;Tom Straw Mystery Writer&#x27;s Award&quot;, were apparently created to fete actor Nathan Fillion with said award; however, at that point in time, the general public remained unaware of the connection. The general mystery persisted regarding the ghost-writer&#x27;s true identity, despite the fact that some then proposed the possibility that therefore Straw must be the true ghost-writer. The ghost-writer&#x27;s name was only finally fully revealed after the series production was discontinued in 2016. It was then officially acknowledged that the &quot;Castle&quot; book series was indeed entirely written by a ghostwriter and that established screenwriter Tom Straw wrote the first seven.

<doc id="1175858" wikidata="Q2428804" url="?curid=1175858" title="Aalto Vase">
<text>The Aalto Vase, also known as the Savoy Vase, is a piece of glassware created by Alvar Aalto and his wife Aino that has become an internationally known iconic piece of Finnish design. It became known as the Savoy Vase because it was one of a range of custom furnishings and fixtures created by Alvar and Aino Aalto for the luxury Savoy restaurant in Helsinki that opened in 1937.

The vase was also designed as an entry in a design competition for the Ahlström-owned Karhula-Iittala glassworks factory in 1936. The design was inspired by the dress of a Sami woman. Called &quot;Eskimåkvinnans skinnbyxa&quot; (the Eskimo woman&#x27;s leather breech), the design consisted of a series of crayon drawings on cardboard and scratch paper. Aalto created initial prototypes by blowing glass in the middle of a composition of wooden sticks stuck into the ground, letting the molten glass swell on only some sides and creating a wavy outline. The initial manufacture of the vase was not without problems and the original idea of using molds made of thin steel sheets forced together to form closed sinuous shapes had to be abandoned. The vase was originally manufactured by the glassworks factory using a wood mold which was slowly burned away.

This vase was later displayed for the 1937 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris and the original height of the Savoy vase was .

Aalto never made money with the vase, because the design belonged to the factory for which the design competition entry was produced.

The vase has been manufactured in nearly a full spectrum of colours. The simplicity of the vase continues to be popular in the 21st century. Smaller versions of the vase, just as Aalto designed them with the seams visible and a slight curve at the base, are still produced by glasspressing at the Iittala glass factory in Iittala, Finland. Larger versions are made using Aalto&#x27;s design, but without seams.

In recent times the vase has achieved iconic status, inspiring adaptations and appropriations by contemporary designers including Jan Ctvrtnik, and Tobi Wong.

<doc id="1175860" wikidata="Q174651" url="?curid=1175860" title="Bálint's syndrome">
<text>Bálint&#x27;s syndrome is an uncommon and incompletely understood triad of severe neuropsychological impairments: inability to perceive the visual field as a whole (simultanagnosia), difficulty in fixating the eyes (oculomotor apraxia), and inability to move the hand to a specific object by using vision (optic ataxia). It was named in 1909 for the Austro-Hungarian neurologist and psychiatrist Rezső Bálint who first identified it.

Bálint&#x27;s syndrome occurs most often with an acute onset as a consequence of two or more strokes at more or less the same place in each hemisphere. Therefore, it occurs rarely. The most frequent cause of complete Bálint&#x27;s syndrome is said by some to be sudden and severe hypotension, resulting in bilateral borderzone infarction in the occipito-parietal region. More rarely, cases of progressive Bálint&#x27;s syndrome have been found in degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or certain other traumatic brain injuries at the border of the parietal and the occipital lobes of the brain.

Lack of awareness of this syndrome may lead to a misdiagnosis and resulting inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Therefore, clinicians should be familiar with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome and its various etiologies.

==Presentation==

Bálint&#x27;s syndrome symptoms can be quite debilitating since they impact visuospatial skills, visual scanning and attentional mechanisms. Since it represents impairment of both visual and language functions, it is a significant disability that can affect the patient&#x27;s safety—even in one&#x27;s own home environment, and can render the person incapable of maintaining employment. In many cases the complete trio of symptoms—inability to perceive the visual field as a whole (simultanagnosia), difficulty in fixating the eyes (oculomotor apraxia), and inability to move the hand to a specific object by using vision (optic ataxia)—may not be noticed until the patient is in rehabilitation. Therapists unfamiliar with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome may misdiagnose a patient&#x27;s inability to meet progress expectations in any of these symptom areas as simply indicating incapability of benefiting from further traditional therapy. The very nature of each Bálint symptom frustrates rehabilitation progress in each of the other symptoms. Much more research is needed to develop therapeutic protocols that address Bálint symptoms as a group since the disabilities are so intertwined.

===Simultanagnosia===

Simultanagnosia is the inability to perceive simultaneous events or objects in one&#x27;s visual field. People with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome perceive the world erratically, as a series of single objects rather than seeing the wholeness of a scene.

This spatial disorder of visual attention—the ability to identify local elements of a scene, but not the global whole—has been referred to as a constriction of the individual&#x27;s global gestalt window—their visual &quot;window&quot; of attention. People fixate their eyes to specific images in social scenes because they are informative to the meaning of the scene. Any forthcoming recovery in simultanagnosia may be related to somehow expanding the restricted attentional window that characterizes this disorder.

Simultanagnosia is a profound visual deficit. It impairs the ability to perceive multiple items in a visual display, while preserving the ability to recognize single objects. One study suggests that simultanagnosia may result from an extreme form of competition between objects which makes it difficult for attention to be disengaged from an object once it has been selected. Patients with simultanagnosia have a restricted spatial window of visual attention and cannot see more than one object at a time. They see their world in a patchy, spotty manner. Therefore, they pick out a single object, or even components of an individual object, without being able to see the global &quot;big picture.&quot;

A study which directly tested the relationship between the restriction of the attentional window in simultanagnosia compared with the vision of healthy participants with normal limits of visual processing confirmed the limitations of difficulties of patients with simultanagnosia.

There is considerable evidence that a person&#x27;s cortex is essentially divided into two functional streams: an occipital-parietal-frontal pathway that processes &quot;where&quot; information and an occipital-temporal-frontal pathway that provides &quot;what&quot; information to the individual.

===Oculomotor apraxia===

Bálint referred to this as &quot;psychic paralysis of gaze&quot;—the inability to voluntarily guide eye movements, changing to a new location of visual fixation. A major symptom of Oculomotor apraxia is that a person has no control over their eye movements, however, vertical eye movements are typically unaffected. For example, they often have difficulty moving their eyes in the desired direction. In other words, the saccades (rapid eye movements) are abnormal. Because of this, most patients with Oculomotor apraxia have to turn their heads in order to follow objects coming from their peripherals.

===Optic ataxia===
Optic ataxia is the inability to guide the hand toward an object using visual information where the inability cannot be explained by motor, somatosensory, visual field deficits or acuity deficits. Optic ataxia is seen in Bálint&#x27;s syndrome where it is characterized by an impaired visual control of the direction of arm-reaching to a visual target, accompanied by defective hand orientation and grip formation. It is considered a specific visuomotor disorder, independent of visual space misperception.

Optic ataxia is also known as misreaching or dysmetria (), secondary to visual perceptual deficits. A patient with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome likely has defective hand movements under visual guidance, despite normal limb strength. The patient is unable to grab an object while looking at the object, due to a discoordination of eye and hand movement. It is especially true with their contralesional hand.

Dysmetria refers to a lack of coordination of movement, typified by the undershoot or overshoot of intended position with the hand, arm, leg, or eye. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale.

The reaching ability of the patient is also altered. It takes them longer to reach toward an object. Their ability to grasp an object is also impaired. The patient&#x27;s performance is even more severely deteriorated when vision of either the hand or the target is prevented.

==Cause==
The visual difficulties in Bálint&#x27;s syndrome are usually due to damage to the parieto-occipital lobes on both sides of the brain. The parietal lobe is the middle area of the top part of the brain and the occipital lobe is the back part of the brain. (It usually does not affect the temporal lobes)

==Diagnosis==
Lack of awareness of the syndrome may lead to misdiagnosis such as blindness, psychosis, or dementia. Symptoms of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome are most likely to be noticed first by optometrists or ophthalmologists during an eye check up, or therapists providing rehabilitation following brain lesions. However, due to the scarcity among practitioners of familiarity with the syndrome, the symptoms are often explained away incorrectly without being considered as a possibility and followed by medical confirmation of clinical and neuroradiological findings. Any severe disturbance of space representation, spontaneously appearing following bilateral parietal damage, strongly suggests the presence of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome and should be investigated as such. One study reports that damage to the bilateral dorsal occipitoparietal regions appeared to be involved in Bálint&#x27;s syndrome.

===Neuroanatomical evidence===
Bálint&#x27;s syndrome has been found in patients with bilateral damage to the posterior parietal cortex. The primary cause of the damage and the syndrome can originate from multiple strokes, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, intracranial tumors, or brain injury. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease have also been found to cause this kind of damage. This syndrome is caused by damage to the posterior superior watershed areas, also known as the parietal-occipital vascular border zone (Brodmann&#x27;s areas 19 and 7).

===Manifestations===
Some telltale signs suggesting Bálint&#x27;s syndrome following bilateral brain insults may include:
* limitation to perceive only stimuli that is presented at 35 to 40 degrees to the right. They are able to move their eyes but cannot fixate on specific visual stimuli (optic apraxia).
* patient&#x27;s field of attention is limited to one object at a time. making activities like reading difficult because each letter is perceived separately (simultanagnosia).
* figure/ground defects in which a patient can see either the background but not the object residing somewhere in the whole scene, or conversely can see the object but sees no background around it (simultanagnosia)
* a patient, while attempting to put one foot into a slipper by trying to insert the foot into a nonexistent slipper several inches from the real slipper, even as the patient focuses on the actual slipper (optic ataxia)
* a patient raising a fork or spoon containing food to a point on the patient&#x27;s face above or below the mouth, and possibly finding the mouth by trial and error by manually moving the utensil on the face (optic ataxia)

==Treatment==
In terms of the specific rehabilitation of visuoperceptual disorders such as Bálint&#x27;s syndrome, the literature is extremely sparse. According to one study, rehabilitation training should focus on the improvement of visual scanning, the development of visually guided manual movements, and the improvement of the integration of visual elements. Very few treatment strategies have been proposed, and some of those have been criticized as being poorly developed and evaluated.

Three approaches to rehabilitation of perceptual deficits, such as those seen in Bálint&#x27;s syndrome, have been identified:
# The adaptive (functional) approach, which involves functional tasks utilising the person&#x27;s strengths and abilities, helping them to compensate for problems or altering the environment to lessen their disabilities. This is the most popular approach.
# The remedial approach, which involves restoration of the damaged CNS by training in the perceptual skills, which may be generalised across all activities of daily living. This could be achieved by tabletop activities or sensorimotor exercises.
# The multi-context approach, which is based on the fact that learning is not automatically transferred from one situation to another. This involves practicing of a targeted strategy in a multiple environment with varied tasks and movement demands, and it incorporates self-awareness tasks.

==Case studies==
Symptoms of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome were found in the case of a 29-year-old with migraines. In the aura before the migraine headache, she experienced an inability to see all of the objects in the visual field simultaneously; an inability to coordinate hand and eye movements; and an inability to look at an object on command. Symptoms were not present before the onset of the migraine or after it passed.

A study of a patient with Corticobasal Ganglionic Degeneration (CBGD) also showed a development of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome. As a result of CBGD, the patient developed an inability to move his eyes to specific visual objects in his peripheral fields. He also was unable to reach out and touch objects in his peripheral fields. An inability to recognize more than one item at a time was also experienced when presented with the Cookie Theft Picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination.

A 58-year-old male presented with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome secondary to severe traumatic brain injury 4-months post-injury onset. He had completed a comprehensive post-acute brain injury rehabilitation program. He received 6 months of rehabilitation services as an inpatient. A three-pronged approach included the implementation of (a) compensatory strategies, (b) remediation exercises and (c) transfer of learned skills in multiple environments and situations. Comprehensive neuropsychological and occupational therapy evaluations were performed at admission and at discharge. Neuropsychological test improvements were noted on tasks that assess visuospatial functioning, although most gains were noted for functional and physical abilities.

A patient with congenital deafness exhibited partial Bálint&#x27;s syndrome symptoms. This patient experienced an inability to perceive simultaneous events in her visual field. She was also unable to fixate and follow an object with her eyes. In addition, her ability to point at targets under visual guidance was impaired.

Bálint&#x27;s syndrome is rarely reported in children, but some recent studies provide evidence that cases do exist in children. A case involving a 10-year-old male child with Bálint&#x27;s syndrome has been reported Similar results were seen in a 7-year-old boy. In children this syndrome results in a variety of occupational difficulties, but most notably difficulties in schoolwork, especially reading. The investigators encourage more careful recognition of the syndrome to allow adequate rehabilitation and environmental adaptation.

===Criticism===
The validity of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome has been questioned by some. The components in the syndrome&#x27;s triad of defects (simultanagnosia, oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia) each may represent a variety of combined defects.

<text>Charles Luther Sifford (June 2, 1922 – February 3, 2015) was an American professional golfer who was the first African American to play on the PGA Tour. He won the Greater Hartford Open in 1967 and the Los Angeles Open in 1969. He also won the United Golf Association&#x27;s National Negro Open six times, and the PGA Seniors&#x27; Championship in 1975.

For his contributions to golf, Sifford was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2004. He was awarded the Old Tom Morris Award in 2007, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014, and an honorary doctorate from the University of St Andrews. Lee Trevino referred to Sifford as the &quot;Jackie Robinson&quot; of golf, and Tiger Woods acknowledged that Sifford paved the way for his career.

==Early life and career==
Sifford was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1922. He began work as a caddy at the age of thirteen. He moved to Philadelphia when he was 17 years old, where he played against local black golfers. He often played at Philadelphia&#x27;s Cobbs Creek Golf Course, a public facility that did not restrict players based on race, gender, or ethnicity.

Sifford began golfing professionally in 1948. He competed in the golf tournaments that black golfers organized for themselves as they were excluded from the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America (PGA). Sifford won the United Golf Association&#x27;s National Negro Open six times, including consecutive wins from 1952 through 1956. Sifford later worked as a valet and golf instructor to the singer Billy Eckstine, who also financially supported his career when he was unable to find sponsorship.

Sifford first attempted to qualify for a PGA Tour event at the 1952 Phoenix Open, using an invitation obtained by former World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. Sifford was subjected to threats and racial abuse there and at other tournaments.

In 1957, Sifford won the Long Beach Open, which was not an official PGA Tour event, but was co-sponsored by the PGA and had some well-known white players in the field. Sifford competed in the U. S. Open in 1959 for the first time and tied for 32nd place. He became a member of the Tour in 1961, thus becoming the first African-American to join the PGA Tour. He went on to win two official money events, the 1967 Greater Hartford Open and the 1969 Los Angeles Open, and finished in the top 60 in overall winnings in his first nine years as a member of the PGA Tour. He also won the 1963 Puerto Rico Open and the 1971 Sea Pines. He tied for 21st place at the 1972 U.S. Open, his best finish in a major tournament. He competed in the PGA Seniors&#x27; Championship, then the leading tournament for golfers over fifty, winning the event in 1975.

==Personal life==
Sifford&#x27;s wife, Rose, died in 1998. They had two sons, Charles Jr. and Craig.

Sifford, a resident of Brecksville, Ohio, was hospitalized for a stroke one month before he died in Cleveland, Ohio. He died on February 3, 2015, at the age of 92.

==Honors==
Lee Trevino said of Sifford, &quot;You have to put him in the Jackie Robinson category.&quot; Tiger Woods named his son Charlie after him and referred to Sifford as &quot;the Grandpa I never had,&quot; and that, without Sifford, &quot;I probably wouldn&#x27;t be here. My dad would have never picked up the game. Who knows if the clause would still exist or not? But he broke it down.&quot;

In 2004, Sifford became the first African American inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He chose Hall of Fame member South African Gary Player to present him for induction. On June 22, 2006, he received an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews as a Doctor of Laws. He also received the 2007 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA), the GCSAA&#x27;s highest honor.

In 2009, the Northern Trust Open created an exemption for a player who represents the advancement of diversity in golf; it is named in honor of Sifford and is referred to as the Charlie Sifford Exemption.

In 2011, Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation changed the name of Revolution Park Golf Course to Dr. Charles L. Sifford Golf Course at Revolution Park.

President Barack Obama awarded him the 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

<text>Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 – 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is regarded as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. In Test cricket, Barnes played for England in 27 matches from 1901 to 1914, taking 189 wickets at 16.43, one of the lowest Test bowling averages ever achieved. In 1911–12, he helped England to win the Ashes when he took 34 wickets in the series against Australia. In 1913–14, his final Test series, he took a world record 49 wickets in a Test series, against South Africa.

Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, briefly representing Warwickshire (1894 to 1896) and Lancashire (1899 to 1903). Instead, he preferred league and minor counties cricket for mostly professional reasons. He had two phases playing for his native Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship from 1904 to 1914 and from 1924 to 1935. He played exclusively for Saltaire Cricket Club in the Bradford League from 1915 to 1923. In his wider career from 1895 to 1934, he variously represented several clubs in each of the Bradford, Central Lancashire, Lancashire and North Staffordshire leagues.

==Early life==
Barnes was born on 19 April 1873 in Smethwick, Staffordshire. He was the second son of five children whose father, Richard, lived nearly all of his life in Staffordshire, working for 63 years at the Muntz Metal Company which was based at Selly Oak in Birmingham. His father did not play much cricket and Barnes was the only one of three brothers who ever &quot;touched a bat or ball&quot;.

==Work outside cricket==
Outside cricket, Barnes worked as a clerk in a Staffordshire colliery until 1914, and later at Staffordshire County Council, where he became skilful in calligraphy. Even into his nineties, his skill as an inscriber of legal documents was still in demand. In 1957, he was asked to present a handwritten scroll to Elizabeth II to commemorate her visit to Stafford.

==Cricket career==
===1888 to 1894===
Barnes&#x27;s career began in 1888 when he was fifteen and played for a small club which had a ground behind the Galton Hotel in Smethwick. Soon afterwards, he joined Smethwick Cricket Club and played for its third team. He was taught to bowl off spin by Billy Bird, the Smethwick professional who had played for Warwickshire, and then taught himself to bowl leg spin. In due course, he was selected for the second team and had earned a place in the first team, playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League, at the start of the 1893 season.

In 1894, when Barnes was a 21-year-old fast bowler, he was asked to join the ground staff of Staffordshire County Cricket Club but he found the terms unattractive. Instead, he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League where the pay was better than in any form of county cricket, largely because of match bonuses and collections. He played for Rishton until 1899. Wilfrid S. White commented that Barnes&#x27;s career in league cricket &quot;stands out unparalleled, unapproached, by any other player&quot;.

Later in the 1894 season, Barnes was invited to play for Warwickshire, who were due to enter the County Championship in 1895. His debut was in a minor match against Cheshire at Edgbaston on 20–21 August. Barnes bowled only 8 overs, taking none for 27, and the match was drawn. On 23 August, Barnes made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground, except that he did not take the field as play was restricted by bad weather to just 72 overs of his team&#x27;s first innings, in which they reached 102–2.

===1895 to 1903===
Barnes played only three more times for Warwickshire: twice in May 1895 and once in June 1896. He took just three wickets in these matches, having bowled 86 overs and conceded 226 runs. Barnes finished with Warwickshire after they invited him to play in a match and then sent him a telegram telling him not to come because an amateur would be playing. So, he chose to play mostly for Rishton from 1895 to 1899, making 38 appearances and taking 411 wickets, his best season being 1898 when he took 96 wickets at 8.46. Barnes had been a fast bowler with Warwickshire but in his time at Rishton he reduced his pace to medium fast and experimented with spin.

Barnes&#x27;s association with Lancashire began in 1899 when he played for the club&#x27;s Second XI against Staffordshire in a match at the County Ground, Stoke-on-Trent, on 10 and 11 July. He took ten wickets in the match including a match-winning analysis of eight for 38 in the second innings. In August, he made his first-team debut for Lancashire and played in two County Championship matches against Sussex and Surrey but he had only moderate success with a best return of three for 99 against Surrey. He rejected an offer to join the Lancashire ground staff, preferring to remain in better-paid league cricket, which he could combine with full-time employment as a clerk in a Staffordshire colliery.

In 1900, Barnes left Rishton and joined Burnley Cricket Club, also in the Lancashire League. He did not represent Lancashire that season but reappeared in 1901 when he made two Second XI appearances against Yorkshire&#x27;s Second XI and one County Championship match, the last match of the season in late August against Leicestershire at Old Trafford. This was a rain-interrupted draw but Barnes scored 32 runs and then took six for 70 in the Leicestershire first innings, reducing them to an all-out 140 in response to Lancashire&#x27;s total of 328–8 declared. Lancashire wanted Barnes to sign for them in 1902, but Barnes, always financially aware, was unsure, as he considered first-class county cricket to be &quot;a great deal of hard work for relatively little money&quot;, and he liked his arrangement with Burnley supplementing his full-time job.

Lancashire&#x27;s captain was Archie MacLaren who was about to form an England team to tour Australia in 1901–02 and, despite Barnes&#x27;s limited first-class career to this point, he was invited to join the squad. This came about because Lord Hawke refused to allow George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes to travel but MacLaren had become, to quote White, &quot;the first to see in Barnes a bowler of international calibre&quot;. Barnes&#x27;s selection was a major surprise and considered to be &quot;the most daring experiment in the history of the game&quot;. For Barnes, &quot;job security was always a prime consideration&quot; and he accepted the tour but with misgivings.

Barnes was a great success in Australia but his participation was cut short by a knee injury. He played against three state teams before making his Test debut against Australia on 13 December 1901 at Sydney Cricket Ground, where he took five for 65 in the first innings. Also making their debuts in this Test were Colin Blythe and Len Braund. Between them, the three debutant bowlers took all twenty Australian wickets as England won by an innings and 124 runs. Australia levelled the series in the second Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, winning by 229 runs although Barnes had figures of six for 42 and seven for 121. Monty Noble trumped Barnes&#x27;s effort with seven for 17 and six for 60. Although successful, taking nineteen wickets in the two Tests to add to the thirteen in his previous seven first-class matches, Barnes was over-bowled. He injured a knee in the third Test at Adelaide Oval and missed the remainder of the tour. He later said he was still far short of his best at the time, but he had established himself as a world-class bowler.

Differences arose between Barnes and MacLaren because Barnes was, in Derek Birley&#x27;s words, &quot;the arch-professional (who) expected due reward (for his efforts)&quot;. This was in stark contrast to MacLaren&#x27;s &quot;starry-eyed public school enthusiasm&quot; and the two did not get on personally. After leaving Australia, the team were crossing the Tasman Sea in a storm which had them &quot;fearing for their lives&quot;. At one point, MacLaren was heard to say: &quot;Well, there&#x27;s one consolation. If we go down, that bugger Barnes will go down with us&quot;.

Barnes was selected only once in England&#x27;s home series against Australia in 1902. This was for the third Test, the only Test ever held at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, which Australia won by 143 runs. Barnes took six for 49 and one for 50, but Noble with 11 wickets was again Australia&#x27;s matchwinner.

Despite his differences with MacLaren, Barnes became a first team regular at Lancashire through the 1902 and 1903 seasons, producing several successful performances, although he was still troubled in 1902 by the knee injury sustained on tour. In 1903, Barnes was in dispute with Lancashire about winter employment and being &quot;much over-bowled&quot;. Near the end of the season, Barnes took part in the Gentlemen v Players match but was unfit and could only bowl one over. Comments were made in the press that it was unfair of Barnes to &quot;claim a fee and then not perform&quot;. Barnes thought it unfair that he should be paid the same as teammates who did much less work. Lancashire were paying him £3 a week in summer and £1 in winter, whereas in the Lancashire League he could get £8 plus bonuses for playing Saturdays only. Barnes tried to get more from Lancashire and refused to sign a contract for 1904. Lancashire called his bluff and dropped him from the team for their final match of the season. Barnes went back to the leagues and minor counties for good and never played in the County Championship again.

The 1902 and 1903 seasons were the only ones between 1895 and 1934 in which Barnes did not play league cricket. He played in 22 first-class matches in 1902, taking 95 wickets at an average of 21.56 with a best analysis of six for 39 and one match in which he took 10 wickets. He is listed well down the national averages and his overall performance bears moderate comparison with that of, for example, Wilfred Rhodes who took 213 wickets at 13.15 with five ten-wicket matches. In 1903, Barnes made 24 appearances and took 131 wickets at 17.85. He was ninth of those bowlers who took 100 wickets; his best analysis was eight for 37 and he had three ten-wicket matches. 1903 was the only season in which Barnes took 100 wickets in an English first-class season, although he did capture 104 wickets in South Africa in 1913–14.

===1904 to 1914===
Barnes joined Staffordshire in 1904 and played in the Minor Counties Championship until 1914. He combined this with weekend league cricket, returning to the Lancashire League for the 1904 and 1905 seasons to play for Church. In 1906, he moved to the North Staffordshire League and was with Porthill to 1914. Barnes did not play first-class cricket again for over four years until he joined an occasional team playing against the South African tourists in September 1907. He toured Australia the following winter and the bulk of his Test career was played from then till 1914. He made eight appearances for the Players in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players series during this period, culminating in the July 1914 match.

Barnes returned to Test cricket when England toured Australia in 1907–08. This time, he played in all five Tests and took 24 wickets at 26.08 with a best performance of seven for 60. In the second Test, which England won by 1 wicket, it was Barnes&#x27;s batting that was crucial as he shared stands of 34 for the ninth wicket with Joe Humphries and an unbeaten 39 for the last with Arthur Fielder. When the tourists played Western Australia, Barnes shared a stand with George Gunn of over 200 for the fifth wicket while scoring 93, his personal best in first-class cricket.

In the 1909 season, Barnes played in the last three of England&#x27;s five Tests against Australia. In the third Test at Headingley, he took six for 63 in Australia&#x27;s second innings but England lost by 126 runs. The fourth Test at Old Trafford was drawn, Barnes taking five for 56 in the first innings. In the final Test at The Oval, Barnes took two wickets in each innings of another drawn match. In 1910, Barnes was made a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.

Barnes joined the MCC tour of Australia in 1911–12 and played in all five Tests. In the first Test at Sydney, which England lost, captain Johnny Douglas shared the new ball with left-arm seamer Frank Foster. Barnes, disgusted at being made a change bowler, sulked and gave a performance that was well below par. At Melbourne, however, Douglas bowed to the pressure and surrendered the new ball to the Staffordshire bowler, who responded with a spell of four wickets for one run in his first five overs. His first four victims were Warren Bardsley, Charles Kelleway, Clem Hill and Warwick Armstrong. When Frank Foster dismissed Victor Trumper and Barnes added Roy Minnett, the home side were reduced to 38 for six. Barnes took 39 wickets in the series with three five-wicket hauls.

In the 1912 Triangular Tournament, Barnes played in all six of England&#x27;s Tests, three each against Australia and South Africa. In the three matches against South Africa, he took 34 wickets for 282 runs.

In 1913–14, Barnes toured South Africa with MCC and played in the first four Tests of a five match series. He missed the last Test because of a financial disagreement. His 49 wickets on the matting pitches used in this series remains the world record for wickets taken in a Test series. In the second Test at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg, he became the first bowler to take more than 15 wickets in a Test with figures of eight for 56 and nine for 103 resulting in a match analysis of seventeen for 159.

Only Jim Laker&#x27;s match analysis of nineteen for 90 in 1956 has since surpassed this feat in Test cricket. Don Bradman recalled seeing Barnes at Old Trafford after Laker had destroyed Australia in that match. &quot;Well, what did you think of that?&quot;, Bradman asked Barnes. He received the gruff reply that &quot;no bugger ever got all ten when I was on at the other end&quot;, probably a reference to the fact that Laker&#x27;s co-bowler Tony Lock did not take a wicket in the second innings (in the whole match, Lock took one for 106 in 69 overs).

Barnes took 189 Test wickets. His average of 16.43 and strike rate of 41.65 are the lowest amongst bowlers who have played in more than 25 Tests and taken more than 150 wickets, although Kagiso Rabada currently has a lower strike rate. His closest challenger is Alan Davidson, who took 186 wickets at 20.53. Barnes took his 150th Test match wicket in only his 24th Test, which is a world record. Next best are Waqar Younis and Yasir Shah (27 Tests each).

===1915 to 1923===
Barnes was 41 when the First World War began and so too old for military service. First-class cricket was shelved for the duration but league cricket continued and numerous top-class players including Jack Hobbs, Wilfred Rhodes and Frank Woolley signed up to play in the Bradford League. Barnes saw an advert placed by Saltaire Cricket Club in the &quot;Athletic News&quot; periodical and applied for the role by saying: &quot;Will I do?&quot; From 1915 to 1923, he played exclusively and with great success for Saltaire. The club and their ground at Roberts Park had been founded in 1871 and they joined the Bradford League in 1905. They won the league three times (1917, 1918 and 1922) while Barnes played for them. On his debut in May 1915, he took eight for eight against Bowling Old Lane and followed that with all ten for fourteen against Baildon Green, including five wickets in five successive balls. In later seasons, he took all ten against Bowling Old Lane and Keighley.

Barnes knew full well his value to Saltaire and characteristically drove a hard bargain. There were several record crowd and gate receipt matches when he was playing, including one Priestley Cup final at Bradford Park Avenue, a first-class ground used by Yorkshire. Barnes started on £3 10s per match in 1915 plus travel and accommodation, though he did soon remove to Saltaire (and the club paid his removal costs). His match fee doubled in 1916 and had increased to £18 15s in 1922. Like all professionals operating in league cricket, he benefited from &quot;pass the hat&quot; crowd collections (performance rewards) at each game and, as an additional supplement, he secured a coaching role at Bradford Grammar School which is near Saltaire. Saltaire over-reached themselves somewhat and it took an effort to re-balance the books in the 1920s following Barnes&#x27;s departure.

In total, Barnes took 904 wickets for Saltaire at an average of 5.26. He took a hundred wickets in a season five times, a rare feat in the Bradford League&#x27;s history, and headed the bowling averages in every one of his nine seasons there. He had an average of under five in most seasons and even his highest was only seven, which is itself generally held to be a remarkable bowling average in any level of competition.

Fifteen years after Barnes left Saltaire, they signed the young Jim Laker, then a sixteen year old schoolboy who lived in nearby Baildon. Laker played for Saltaire through the 1938 to 1940 seasons. He joined the British Army in 1941 and spent the Second World War in Egypt. He did not develop his off break bowling skill until he joined the Army and at Saltaire he was recognised primarily as a promising batsman who was also a useful pace bowler. During that time, when he was attending a coaching class with Yorkshire at Headingley, Laker listened to a conversation between George Hirst and Herbert Sutcliffe who apparently did not often agree with each other about cricket, but Laker recalled Sutcliffe being in complete agreement with Hirst&#x27;s view that &quot;Sydney Barnes was the greatest bowler there has ever been and what&#x27;s more the greatest bowler there ever will be&quot;. Around that time, Laker had watched Barnes, then in his sixties, when he guested in a Bradford League match. Laker recalled that Barnes&#x27;s control of the ball was &quot;still remarkable&quot;.

After Laker became an England bowler himself, he was able to meet Barnes and remembered one conversation in particular which took place at Lord&#x27;s. Laker was impressed by Barnes&#x27;s genuine enthusiasm and self-confidence. He had been told that Barnes would bowl such varied deliveries as an in-swinger, a fast off break and a leg-cutter all in the same over. Laker asked Barnes if that was true and Barnes said: &quot;Keep trying something different&quot;. Laker heeded his advice.

===1924 to 1935===
Barnes declined an opportunity to join the tour to Australia in 1920–21, when he was 47 years old. He wanted to take his family with him, but it soon became clear that he would have to pay their traveling expenses. He was not selected by England nor did he seek selection by the Players after the First World War. He did not play first-class cricket again until 1927 when he was 54 years old. From then until 1930, he made nine appearances for Wales.

He left Saltaire after the 1923 season and returned to Staffordshire where he remained until 1935. As in his first spell with the county, he decided he would also play league cricket at weekends. From 1924 to 1930, this was in the Central Lancashire League, first with Castleton Moor (1924 to 1928) and then for Rochdale (1929 and 1930). He moved to Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League from 1931 to 1933. Then, aged 61, he returned to the Bradford League to play for Keighley in 1934, which was his final season in league cricket.

Barnes took 49 wickets for Wales in 1928, including seven for 51 and five for 67 in an eight wicket win over the touring West Indians. He also made two first-class appearances for the Minor Counties in 1929 and took eight for 41 in a drawn game against the South Africans at Stoke-on-Trent. Barnes&#x27;s final first-class appearance was for Wales against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord&#x27;s in 1930.

Barnes made a total of 177 appearances for Staffordshire in two spells from 1904 to 1914 and 1924 to 1935. His career record for Staffordshire was 1,432 wickets at an average of 8.03. Aged 62, he played twice for Staffordshire in 1935 and, although he did make occasional reappearances in later years, that was effectively the end of his cricketing career. His last match for Staffordshire was against Yorkshire Seconds on the Savile Park ground at Castleford on 3 &amp; 4 July 1935 where he took none for 36 and one for 61.

==Approach and technique==
Barnes bowled with consistent attacking intent, consistently making the batsmen play, and using ongoing variation.

He could bowl balls that swung and/or spun both ways, at a range of speeds (mostly fast-medium). He in particular delivered leg-breaks bowled at pace and without rotation of the wrist. The spin was derived purely from the twist exerted by his fingers (which were described as long) rather than through leverage of the wrist or elbow. Fielders at mid-off and mid-on reported hearing the snap of his fingers as he bowled, with the batsmen unable to read which way the ball would break.

Barnes was described as more than six feet tall and maintaining an erect posture with wide shoulders, a deep chest, long arms and strong legs – in John Arlott&#x27;s view, &quot;perfectly built to be a bowler&quot;. He bowled right arm fast-medium but also had what Arlott called &quot;the accuracy, spin and resource of a slow bowler&quot;. Barnes&#x27;s high delivery provided him with a lift off the pitch that forced even the best batsmen to play him at an awkward height. He was clever at concealing his pace and could produce deliveries that were both appreciably faster and slower than his usual fast-medium pace; and could bowl an effective yorker. Barnes considered himself essentially a spin bowler as he bowled both the off-break and the leg-break, but at a fast pace. Although technically formidable, Barnes allied his skillset to a hostile persona and great stamina which, Arlott says, &quot;were reflected in constant, unrelenting probing for a batsman&#x27;s weakness and then attacking it by surprise, each ball fitting into a tactical pattern&quot;. In Barnes&#x27;s era, the same ball would be used for the whole of a team&#x27;s innings, with no new ball, although bowlers were assisted by the unpredictability of uncovered pitches.

Harry Altham wrote of Barnes&#x27;s bowling: &quot;At appreciably more than medium pace he could, even in the finest weather and on the truest wickets in Australia, both swing and break the ball from off or leg. Most deadly of all was the ball which he would deliver from rather wide on the crease, move in with a late swerve the width of the wicket, and then straighten back off the ground to hit the off stump&quot;.

Bernard Hollowood played alongside Barnes for Staffordshire in the 1930s and quoted his father, Albert Hollowood, who had been Barnes&#x27;s Staffordshire captain before the First World War, as saying: &quot;Oh, yes, he could bowl &#x27;em all, but he got his wickets with fast leg-breaks. Marvellous, absolutely marvellous, he was. Fast leg-breaks and always on a length&quot;.

The great Australian batsman Clem Hill told Neville Cardus that, on a perfect wicket, Barnes could swing the new ball in and out &quot;very late&quot;, could spin from the ground, pitch on the leg stump and miss the off. This is evidence of Barnes&#x27;s ability to deploy maximum variety in the space of a single over. Cardus remarked on Barnes&#x27;s creativity as &quot;one of the first bowlers really to use the seam of a new ball and combine swing so subtly with spin that few batsmen could distinguish one from the other&quot;.

Cardus described Barnes&#x27;s &quot;splendid upright action, right arm straight over&quot;. He ran on easy strides. Wilfred Rhodes recalled that Barnes carried the ball in his left hand until, a couple of strides from delivery, he switched it to the right.

==Personality==
As for Barnes&#x27;s controversial character, Cardus said that he was not an easy man to handle on the field of play because there was a &quot;Mephistophelian aspect about him&quot; in that (unlike the amateurs) he didn&#x27;t play cricket out of any &quot;green field starry-eyed idealism&quot;.

Cardus said that Barnes was a hostile, attacking bowler.

Cardus said Barnes always made the batsman play the ball and Barnes himself said about later bowlers sending down so many balls the batsman needn&#x27;t play that: &quot;I didn&#x27;t. I never gave&#x27;em any rest&quot;.

Barnes, said Cardus, was &quot;relentless&quot; and &quot;blew a chill wind of antagonism&quot;, but he mellowed in full age and retirement. (Cardus, Wisden Obituary)

==Hollowood cartoons==
Bernard Hollowood drew two cartoons of Barnes, which appear in his book &quot;Cricket on the Brain&quot;. One depicts him leaping in the air as he appeals for a dismissal and with his index finger raised as though he himself is adjudicating on the appeal. It is entitled &#x27;A.N. Other lbw Barnes... 0&#x27;. John Arlott wrote in his review of the book for the 1971 &quot;Wisden&quot;: &quot;...his two caricatures of S.F. Barnes would seem transcendent if they were not outweighed by his chapter on that great bowler which is a fine passage of cricket literature... this is a book of many and well-cut facets.&quot;

==Personal life==
Barnes married Alice Maud Taylor (née Pearce) in 1903 and they had one child, a son called Leslie who took the photos for Wilfrid S. White&#x27;s biography of Barnes. Barnes was Alice&#x27;s second husband, following her divorce from George Taylor.

In later life, Barnes became friends with Pelham Warner, who was his exact contemporary, and they watched cricket together at Lord&#x27;s.

Barnes died in 1967 at his home in Chadsmoor, Cannock, Staffordshire.

==Awards and tributes==
In the 1963 edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, Barnes was selected by Neville Cardus as one of the &quot;Six Giants of the Wisden Century&quot;. This was a special commemorative selection requested by &quot;Wisden&quot; for its 100th edition. The other five players chosen were Don Bradman, W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper. Soon afterwards, writing in the May 1963 edition of &quot;The Cricketer&quot;, John Arlott published a tribute to Barnes which commemorated his 90th birthday. Arlott wrote that of those who played with or against Barnes, &quot;(they) had no doubt that he stood alone – the greatest bowler that ever lived&quot;. In 2008, when the &quot;ICC Best-Ever Test Championship Ratings&quot; were published, Barnes&#x27;s retrospective rating of 932 at the end of the 1913/14 series was the highest ever achieved. In 2009, Barnes was an inaugural member of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
To mark 150 years of the Cricketers&#x27; Almanack, Wisden named him in an .

<text>Class AM1 was allocated to the prototype AC electric multiple units, converted from fourth-rail DC electric stock in 1952 and used on the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham route. This route had been electrified by the Midland Railway at 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC. These were withdrawn in 1952 and the service reverted to steam haulage. The line voltage was changed to 6.6 kV at 50 Hz in 1953 and the AM1s were introduced. Thus was a test to see if power could be drawn from the National Grid rather than railway owned power stations. The AM1s were fitted with mercury arc rectifiers but one was later converted to a solid state rectifier as a test. The stock was maintained at Meols Cop works near Southport.

The line was closed to passengers and the stock withdrawn in early 1966. Unlike classes AM2-AM11, which became TOPS Classes 302–311, class AM1 was withdrawn before it could take its place in the system as class 301. However, it was the success of these tests that contributed to the decision to choose 25 kV AC overhead electrification as standard in Great Britain outside the Southern Region.

==History==
The electric service started on 17 August 1953, and the trains, very much seen as experimental, ran until 2 January 1966, when they were withdrawn. Each of the four electric trains contained different unique features to test them, and although the original MR electrification equipment, which was still in situ, was used in places, other sections were used for trials of the proposed BR standard electrification features. There was little demand for the service outside the summer holiday season, and the presence of the duplicate former-LNWR route between the Lancaster and Morecambe allowed a replacing diesel service to use that route. The service was complex to operate, for, from the main line ex-LNWR Lancaster Castle station, it ran downhill a short distance to the ex-MR Lancaster Green Ayre station, where trains reversed to run westward along the River Lune to Morecambe Promenade station, where trains reversed again to run to Heysham.

==Previous use==
The carriages converted to form the prototype units were drawn from former LNWR electric units built in 1914 by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon &amp; Finance Company for use on the West London line fourth-rail DC electrification. They had been stored early in World War II after the West London route on which they worked was closed to passengers due to bomb damage. The interiors were modernised with bus-type seating. Driving motor coach 28221 was fitted with a germanium rectifier and displayed at the International Railway Congress, Willesden, London between 26 and 29 May 1954.

==Formations==
Unit numbers were not allocated, but sets were referred to by the last two digits of the DMBSO number. The numbers of individual carriages were:

<doc id="1175882" wikidata="Q679388" url="?curid=1175882" title="Arrondissements of Paris">
<text>The City of Paris is divided into twenty &quot;arrondissements municipaux&quot;, administrative districts, referred to as arrondissements (). These are not to be confused with departmental arrondissements, which subdivide the larger French departments.

The number of the arrondissement is indicated by the last two digits in most Parisian postal codes, 75001 up to 75020. In addition to their number, each arrondissement has a name, often for a local monument. For example, the 5th arrondissement is also called &quot;Panthéon&quot; in reference to the eponymous building. The first four arrondissements have a shared administration, called Paris Centre.

== Description ==
The twenty arrondissements (French: &quot;rounding&quot;) are arranged in the form of a clockwise spiral, often likened to a snail shell, starting from the middle of the city, with the first on the Right Bank (north bank) of the Seine.

In French, notably on street signs, the number is often given in Roman numerals. For example, the Eiffel Tower belongs to the &quot;VIIe arrondissement&quot;, while Gare de l&#x27;Est is in the &quot;Xe arrondissement&quot;. In daily speech, people use the ordinal number corresponding to the arrondissement, e.g. &quot;Elle habite dans le sixième&quot;, &quot;She lives in the 6th (arrondissement)&quot;.

Due to suburbanization, the population of Paris has gradually shifted outward, with only two arrondissements still growing.

==Governance==
Uniquely among French cities, Paris is both a municipality (&quot;commune&quot;) and a department (&quot;département&quot;). Under the PLM Law (&quot;Loi PLM&quot;) of 1982, which redefined the governance of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, hence the PLM acronym, there are both a city council called the Council of Paris, and 20 arrondissement councils in Paris. The PLM Law set limits to the prerogatives of the mayor of Paris, who has to deal with the powers granted to the prefect of police on security issues.

The 20 arrondissement councils (conseils d&#x27;arrondissement) are similar in operation to a municipal council (conseil municipal), but with very few powers. Its members are elected at municipal elections in the same way as in municipalities with more than 3,500 inhabitants. Each arrondissement council is made up of 2/3 members, elected specifically as arrondissement councillors. Council of Paris members representing the arrondissement, also sit &quot;ex officio&quot; on their local arrondissement council.

For example, the council of the 19th arrondissement has 42 members. 28 are &quot;conseillers d&#x27;arrondissement&quot; who only sit on the arrondissement council. 14 are &quot;conseillers de Paris&quot; who also sit on the city council. At its first meeting after the elections, each arrondissement council elects its mayor.

Each arrondissement is subdivided administratively into four &quot;quartiers&quot;. Paris thus has 80 &quot;quartiers administratifs&quot;, each containing a police station. For a table giving the names of the eighty &quot;quartiers&quot;, see Quarters of Paris.

== Arrondissements ==
==History==
On 11 October 1795, Paris was divided into twelve arrondissements. They were numbered from west to east. The numbers 1–9 were on the Right Bank of the Seine. The numbers were 10–12 on the Left Bank. Each arrondissement was subdivided into four &quot;quartiers&quot;, which corresponded to the 48 original districts created in 1790.

In the late 1850s, Emperor Napoleon III and the Prefect of the Seine Baron Haussmann developed a plan to incorporate several of the surrounding communes into the Paris jurisdiction. In 1859, Parliament passed the necessary legislation, and the expansion took effect when the law was promulgated on 3 November 1859. City taxes were extended to the new neighborhoods in July 1860. 

The previous twelve arrondissements were done away with, and twenty new arrondissements were created. In historical records, when it is necessary to distinguish between the two systems, the original arrondissements are indicated by adding the term &quot;ancienne&quot; (&quot;former&quot; or &quot;old&quot;), for example, &quot;2ème ancienne&quot; or &quot;7ème anc&quot;.

Before the reorganization, non-married couples who lived together were said to have &quot;married at the town hall of the 13th arrondissement&quot; (&quot;se marier à la mairie du 13e arrondissement&quot;), as a jocular reference to there being no 13th. When Haussmann released his plan for the new boundaries and numbering system, residents of Passy objected because it placed them in the new 13th arrondissement. The mayor of Passy, Jean-Frédéric Possoz, devised the numbering of the arrondissements in a spiral pattern, beginning on the Right Bank, which put Passy in the 16th. This system turned the Louvre area, which contained the Tuileries Palace and other imperial palaces, into the 1st. The Gobelins area became the 13th instead.

In early 2016, mayor Anne Hidalgo proposed that the first four arrondissements should have their administrations merged. The Council of Paris approved this in February 2016. The four have a combined population of about 100,000, with the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd arrondissements in that order being the four smallest in Paris. In August 2016, the matter was taken up in the National Assembly, and approved in February 2017.

In October 2018, in a postal referendum, the town hall of the 3rd arrondissement was chosen to house the new shared administration. The name &quot;Paris Centre&quot; was chosen for the sector. In June 2020, the reform was implemented, the day after the second round of the 2020 Paris municipal election. The four arrondissements now share a mayor and a district council. The four arrondissements continue to exist, but are no longer used as administrative and electoral sectors.

<doc id="1175891" wikidata="Q6423055" url="?curid=1175891" title="Knot density">
<text>Knot density is a traditional measure for quality of handmade or knotted pile carpets. It refers to the number of knots, or knot count, per unit of surface area - typically either per square inch (kpsi) or per square centimeter (kpsc), but also per decimeter or meter (kpsd or kpsm). Number of knots per unit area is directly proportional to the quality of carpet. Density may vary from or higher, where ≤80 kpsi is poor quality, 120 to 330 kpsi is medium to good, and ≥330 kpsi is very good quality. The inverse, knot ratio, is also used to compare characteristics. Knot density = warp×weft while knot ratio = warp/weft. For comparison: 100,000/square meter = 1,000/square decimeter = 65/square inch = 179/&quot;gereh&quot;.

For two carpets of the same age, origin, condition and design, the one with the higher number of knots will be the more valuable. Knot density is normally measured in knots per square inch (KPSI) which is simply the number of vertical knots across one inch of carpet multiplied by the number of horizontal knots in the same area. Average knot density varies between region and design. A rug could have a knot density half that of another yet still be more valuable, KPSI is only one measurement of quality and value in Persian carpets.

Knot density is related to and affects or affected by the thickness of the length of the pile and the width of the warp and woof, and also the designs and motifs used and their characteristics and appearance. &quot;In rugs with a high knot density, curvilinear, elaborate motifs are possible. In those with a low knot density (as well as kilims), simpler, rectilinear, motifs tend to prevail.&quot; &quot;A carpet design with a high knot density is better adapted to intricate and curvilinear designs, which of necessity must have a shorter pile length to avoid looking blurry. A carpet with a lesser knot density is better adapted to bold, geometric designs and can utilize a long pile for softer, more reflective surface that appeals to the sense of touch.&quot;

Hand-tying of knots is a very labour-intensive task. An average weaver can tie almost 10,000 knots per day. More difficult patterns with an above-average knot density can only be woven by a skillful weaver, thus increasing the production costs even more. An average weaver may tie 360 knots per hour (one every 10 seconds), while 1200 knots approaches the maximum a skilful weaver can tie per hour.

In the late fifteenth century a &quot;carpet design revolution&quot; occurred, made possible by finer yarns, and before this time it is rare to find carpets with ≥120 kpsi but by the next century carpets with three to four times that density were fairly common. For example, the Pazyryk carpet (ca. 400 BC) is around 234 kpsi and the Ardabil Carpets (ca. 1550 AD) are 300–350 kpsi. A fragment of a silk Mughal carpet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art has a knot density of 2,516 kpsi and a silk Hereke prayer rug (ca. 1970 AD) contains 4,360 symmetric kpsi. However, the rug with the highest knot density is a silk Hereke masterpiece by the Özipeks workshops, having an incredible density of approximately 10,000 kpsi, with a production time of about 15 years.

In Persian, &quot;reg&quot; (&quot;raj&quot;, &quot;rag&quot;, Persian: &quot;row, course&quot;) refers to the knots per gereh (Persian: &quot;knot&quot;), which refers to a unit of approximately . &quot;Dihari&quot; is a unit of 6,000 knots used to measure production in India.

<doc id="1175893" wikidata="Q117530" url="?curid=1175893" title="HMAS Brisbane (D 41)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Brisbane&quot; (D 41) was one of three &quot;Perth&quot;-class guided missile destroyers to serve in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The United States-designed ship was laid down at Bay City, Michigan in 1965, launched in 1966 and commissioned into the RAN in 1967. She is named after the city of Brisbane, Queensland.

During her career, &quot;Brisbane&quot; made two deployments to the Vietnam War, was involved in the post-Cyclone Tracy disaster relief operation Navy Help Darwin, and deployed to the Persian Gulf during the first Gulf War. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was decommissioned in 2001, and was sunk as a dive wreck off the Queensland coast in 2005.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Brisbane&quot; was one of three &quot;Perth&quot;-class guided missile destroyers built for the RAN. Based on the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class, &quot;Brisbane&quot; had a displacement of 3,370 tons at standard load, and 4,551 tons at full load, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by two General Electric turbines, which provided to the destroyer&#x27;s two propeller shafts. &quot;Brisbane&quot; could achieve speeds of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 24 officers and 312 sailors.

As a guided missile destroyer, &quot;Brisbane&quot;″s main armament consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher firing Tartar missiles and two Ikara anti-submarine missile launchers. This was supplemented by two 5&quot;/54 calibre Mark 42 guns and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets. Over the course of the ship&#x27;s career, the Mark 13 launcher was modified to fire Standard missiles, two Phalanx CIWS units were installed in 1990, and the Ikara launchers were removed in 1991.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; was laid down by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company at Bay City, Michigan on 15 February 1965. The ship was launched on 5 May 1966 by the wife of Fred Chaney, Sr., the Minister for the Navy. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was handed over to the RAN at Boston Navy Yard on 7 December 1967, and was commissioned into the RAN nine days later. The cost of the destroyer was approximately A$50 million. The ship was given the nicknames &quot;Steel Cat&quot; and &quot;Fighting Forty-One&quot; (references to her ship&#x27;s badge and pennant number respectively). During construction, the ship was assigned the United States Navy hull number DDG-27.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; spent the first nine months of her career undergoing exercises in US waters, before sailing for Australia on 28 September 1968. After visits to Pearl Harbor and Suva, &quot;Brisbane&quot; arrived in her namesake city on 17 October.

==Operational history==

===Vietnam deployments===

During the mid-1960s, the United States government pressured Australia to increase the resources it was committing to the Vietnam War; one of the requests was for a combat vessel to help the USN meet the demand for naval gunfire support operations. The idea of deploying a RAN combat ship to the Vietnam War was initially hampered by the number of ships available, particularly with commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve and involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, along with the difficulty of operating and maintaining British-designed ships with USN resources. On 14 December 1966, the Australian Cabinet approved the deployment of &quot;Hobart&quot; as part of increases to Australian military commitment to the conflict. &quot;Brisbane&quot; operated in one of three roles:
* Naval gunfire support operations to assist ground forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps units operating closest to the North Vietnam border. Seven ships were usually stationed on the &#x27;gunline&#x27;, and attacks fell into two categories: &#x27;unspotted&#x27; shelling of areas where North Vietnamese or Viet Cong forces and facilities were known or believed to be, and &#x27;spotted&#x27; fire missions in direct support of ground troops. In this role, &quot;Brisbane&quot; operated under the callsign &quot;Flamboyant&quot;.
* Anti-infiltration operations under Operation Market Time, which aimed to stop the logistic supply and reinforcement of Viet Cong units operating in South Vietnam by tracking, intercepting, and searching coastal shipping. RAN destroyers were never formally assigned to Market Time, but the overlap of the gunline and Market Time operational areas meant the ships were often called on to assist by tracking suspicious ships or participating in raids.
* Escort of USN aircraft carriers involved in Operation Rolling Thunder airstrikes.
Sister ships &quot;Hobart&quot; and had also been involved in shipping interdiction patrols along the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon, but this operation had ended by the time of &quot;Brisbane&quot;″s first deployment. Although RAN ships on deployment were expected to fulfil all duties of an equivalent American destroyer, they were forbidden by the Australian government from operating outside the Vietnam theatre on unrelated Seventh Fleet duties (such as the Taiwan Patrol Force, guard ship duties at Hong Kong, or the Space Recovery Program). After the invasion of Cambodia in 1970, RAN ships were also prohibited from entering Cambodian waters.

While deployed to Vietnam, the destroyers were placed under the administrative control of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam in addition to that of the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet. Operationally, the RAN vessels were under the command of the United States Seventh Fleet. Arrangements were made to provide logistic support through the United States Pacific Fleet. A USN lieutenant was assigned to each ship during deployments to act as a liaison with the Seventh Fleet. The deployment of in March 1967 began a pattern of six-month deployments for RAN destroyers, with a constant RAN presence with the Seventh Fleet. Australia was the only allied nation to provide naval support to the United States Navy during the Vietnam War.

====First deployment====
After time in Australian waters to prepare for wartime service, &quot;Brisbane&quot; arrived in Subic on 28 March 1969 to be deployed to the Vietnam War. Responsibility was handed over from &quot;Perth&quot; on 31 March, and the ship spent the first two weeks of April undergoing familiarisation exercises and having both gun turrets repaired following equipment failures early on. The destroyer was first deployed to naval gunfire support duties, and arrived off the IV Corps operating area on 15 April. During this period, there was a surge in Market Time activity, and although &quot;Brisbane&quot; was not assigned to that operation, she was asked to provide gunfire assistance on several occasions. On 5 May, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was ordered to the Gulf of Thailand to provide support for South Vietnamese forces operating near the Cambodian border. The destroyer was relieved on 18 May by , and sailed to Subic for maintenance. On 10 June, the Australian ship relieved and commenced gunline duties in the II Corps Area. After four days, during which &quot;Brisbane&quot; and completed a combined 189 fire missions, the Australian ship was ordered north to I Corps to relieve the American cruiser . Here, the Australian ship provided support for 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines during Operation Virginia Ridge. &quot;Brisbane&quot; returned to the II Corps area on 24 June, but only remained in the area for four days; on 29 June, the ship was relieved by , and sailed to Singapore for maintenance and refit. En route to Singapore, the destroyer encountered the merchant vessel , which was on fire. After unsuccessfully attempting to extinguish the fire, &quot;Brisbane&quot; evacuated &quot;Sincere&quot;″s crew, and remained in the area until the salvage vessel &quot;Salvana&quot; arrived to take the stricken vessel in tow.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; returned to operations in II Corps on 15 July. On 22 July, near the end of a shore bombardment operation, a premature explosion occurred in the barrel of the forward gun turret; casualties were limited to one sailor with a fractured wrist, but the turret was unusable. On the ship&#x27;s return to Subic on 3 August, the damaged turret was removed, but as the replacement turret would not arrive until September, &quot;Brisbane&quot; would complete the deployment with only a single gun turret. After the completion of maintenance, &quot;Brisbane&quot; returned to duty on 23 August, but instead of gunline duties, was assigned as the head of the escort screen for the aircraft carrier . The ships were deployed to Yankee Station, with &quot;Brisbane&quot; and (plus other destroyers on occasion) performing escort and plane guard duties. On 12 September, &quot;Oriskany&quot; and &quot;Perkins&quot; departed, and were replaced by and respectively. On 14 September, &quot;Brisbane&quot; sailed to Subic for maintenance and fitting of the replacement turret, then departed on 1 October for Sydney, having been relieved by the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer two days earlier. Arriving on 13 October, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was almost immediately docked for a major refit, which lasted until 15 July 1970.

&quot;Brisbane&quot;″s tour was considered quieter than those experienced previously by Australian ships. This, combined with the damage to the forward gun turret and other defects, meant that the destroyer only fired 7,891 shells during the six-month deployment. Two officers from the ship were Mentioned in Despatches, while other personnel awards included a British Empire Medal and 25 Naval Board commendations.

====Second deployment====
On 29 March 1971, &quot;Brisbane&quot; relieved &quot;Perth&quot; of Vietnam duties. The ship was assigned to Military Region 3 for gunfire support duties, and arrived on 5 April. Shortly after, the destroyer was moved south to Military Region 4. She returned to Military Region 3 on 15 April. The first period on the gunline during that time concluded on 20 April, during which gunfire support operations had occurred on only 11 of the 16 days. The destroyer returned to the gunline on 15 May, with &quot;Brisbane&quot;″s commanding officer tasked as the overall commander of gunfire operations; the only time the position was held by a RAN officer. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was assigned to operate near the Demilitarized Zone. The ship was relieved on 31 May and sailed to Danang. The destroyer was then assigned to escort the carrier . During 3 and 4 May, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was detached to provide cover for the repatriation of prisoners-of-war to North Vietnam. The operation did not go ahead, as only 13 of the 570 prisoners wanted to return to North Vietnam, and the North Vietnamese government refused to accept them. &quot;Brisbane&quot; returned to carrier escort duties, where she remained until sailing to Hong Kong for maintenance on 12 June.

On 24 June, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was assigned back to gunline duties in Military Region 3. Activity was minimal, and the ship was redeployed to Military Region 4 on 26 June. Foul weather prevented gunfire support operations until 30 June, but the rate of activity increased, with 60 fire missions completed by the end of the three-week period. In mid-July, after a short stint back in Region 3, &quot;Brisbane&quot; sailed to Subic for maintenance and leave. On 15 August, the destroyer commenced gunfire support operations off the Demilitarized Zone. A spike in activity had resulted in the deployment of two gunfire support ships, with &quot;Brisbane&quot; and rotating between being the active vessel and being on 15 minutes standby to provide assistance. On 21 August, &quot;Berkeley&quot; was relieved by . Of the 7,231 shells fired during the second deployment, 2,127 were fired from 15 August onwards, which caused a problem as the rate of fire would cause the gun barrels to come up for replacing a week before the destroyer was due to rotate off the gunline. The amount of wear had yet to compromise accuracy, and the destroyer was instructed to continue gunfire missions, while the cruiser and the destroyer were deployed to the gunline in support of &quot;Brisbane&quot;; the Australian destroyer only firing if targets were out of the other ships&#x27; range or they were otherwise unavailable. &quot;Brisbane&quot;″s second Vietnam deployment concluded on 5 September.

During 1971, the Australian government decided to withdraw all forces from Vietnam by the end of the year; &quot;Brisbane&quot; was the last ship to make a combat deployment to Vietnam, and was not replaced when the deployment ended. &quot;Brisbane&quot; received the first of two battle honours, &quot;Vietnam 1969–71&quot;, for her Vietnam service. Personnel awards for the deployment included 24 Naval Board commendations, two personnel Mentioned in Despatches, and the appointment of the ship&#x27;s commanding officer as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

===1970s and 1980s===
On 11 March 1974, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was docked for a major refit. This concluded on 3 October, but the destroyer remained in Sydney for the rest of the year. During the night of 24–25 December 1974, Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city of Darwin; the destroyer&#x27;s personnel were recalled from leave, and she left early on 26 December in the company of , which was loaded with relief supplies. &quot;Brisbane&quot; sped ahead and arrived on 31 December, setting up communications between the relief force and Canberra. The destroyer&#x27;s participation on Operation Navy Help Darwin, the RAN&#x27;s largest disaster-relief operation, was the longest of any RAN vessel; the first to arrive, and the last to depart on 31 January 1975. In addition to facilitating communications, &quot;Brisbane&quot;″s personnel were responsible for clearing sites for helicopters and headquarters, salvaging boats and equipment, repairs of infrastructure, and installation of power generators: on average, 160 of the ship&#x27;s company went ashore each day.

On 16 July 1975, &quot;Brisbane&quot; sailed for a deployment to the Far East Strategic Reserve. This concluded on 5 November, with the destroyer returning to Sydney and docking for maintenance. In early 1977, &quot;Brisbane&quot; participated in the RIMPAC multinational exercise. In April 1977, &quot;Brisbane&quot; and were assigned to escort &quot;Melbourne&quot; during a five-month return trip to the United Kingdom for the Silver Jubilee Naval Review. On 9 May, one of the carrier&#x27;s Sea King helicopters was forced to ditch in the Indian Ocean: &quot;Brisbane&quot; successfully recovered the aircrew. The ships participated in the naval review at Spithead on 28 June, and &quot;Brisbane&quot; returned to Sydney on 4 October, entering dock for refit eight days later. This maintenance period lasted until May 1979, and saw the ship&#x27;s propulsion system converted from fuel oil to diesel, updates to the combat system, and installation of an AN/SPS-40C radar. Apart from a visit to New Zealand, &quot;Brisbane&quot; spent the rest of 1979 in Australian waters.
During the early 1980s, the destroyer participated in RIMPAC exercises, and made patrols of the Indian Ocean. From 16 August 1982 to 5 August 1983, &quot;Brisbane&quot; underwent refit, after which, the destroyer remained docked alongside at Garden Island until March 1984. Another refit period occurred between September 1985 to October 1987. In early 1988, &quot;Brisbane&quot; visited Melbourne for the Moomba festal, then sailed to her namesake city in August to participate in a &#x27;Shopwindow&#x27; exercise with ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy. In October, the destroyer was deployed to South-east Asia for three months, returning to Darwin on 8 January 1989. During June and July, the ship made visits to ports in New Zealand, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands. &quot;Brisbane&quot; attended RIMPAC during April and May 1990, then returned to Australia to prepare for deployment to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Damask.
=== Operation Damask ===
&quot;Brisbane&quot; arrived in the Gulf on 6 December 1990 to serve as part of the naval blockade. She was attached to the United States Navy battle group from 17 January to 28 February 1991. In late March, the destroyer sailed home via Singapore. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation by the Australian government for her actions during Operation Damask. &quot;Brisbane&quot; also earned a second battle honour, &quot;Kuwait 1990–91&quot;.

===1990s and 2000s===
During late 1992, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was operating in South-east Asia. The ship spent most of 1993 exercising along Australia&#x27;s east coast, then docked for a refit lasting from August 1993 until May 1994. The destroyer was deployed to South-east Asia for exercises, flag-showing, and port visits on four occasions between 1994 and 1996, then again in late 1998.

During August 1999, &quot;Brisbane&quot; participated in Exercise Kakadu. During this, a fire broke out in the ship&#x27;s forward gun turret, which was quickly extinguished. In March 2000, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was one of three RAN ships to participate in a Royal New Zealand Navy fleet concentration period.

== Decommissioning and fate ==
&quot;Brisbane&quot; paid off on 19 October 2001. Among the initial ideas for the ship&#x27;s disposal was a proposal to donate the destroyer to the Australian National Maritime Museum as a replacement for the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer . &quot;Brisbane&quot; was eventually marked for scuttling as a dive wreck off the coast of Queensland. Her bridge and one of her guns were removed and preserved at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which were incorporated into the post-1945 galleries, which opened in 2007. The ship&#x27;s air search radar was donated to the Royal Thai Navy in 2002 to help the Thais maintain their naval capabilities.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; was sunk approximately off the coast of Mudjimba, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, on 31 July 2005 in of water. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was filled with of concrete, and 38 small charges were detonated to breach the hull. &quot;Brisbane&quot; sank in two minutes and ten seconds, coming to rest with the keel embedded a metre into the seabed and facing the ocean currents, and the uppermost part of the ship below sea level.

The wreck site has been colonised by sponges, soft corals, and hard corals, while over 200 different species of fish have been sighted in the area. A 2009 study of the value of protected areas estimated that the wreck had contributed A$18 million to the Sunshine Coast economy. In July 2010, the Queensland State Government was forced to step up patrols of the wreck site because people were illegally using the dive exclusion zone as a fishing site. As part of celebrations for the tenth anniversary of &quot;Brisbane&quot; scuttling, 92.7 MIX FM conducted the world&#x27;s first live underwater radio broadcast from the wreck on 31 July 2015.

<text>HMAS &quot;Brisbane&quot; was a Town class light cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built in Sydney between 1913 and 1916 to the &quot;Chatham&quot; subtype design, &quot;Brisbane&quot; operated in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Australian coastal waters during World War I.

Following the end of the war, the cruiser was decommissioned and recommissioned on several occasions, and was reclassified as a training ship in late 1925. In 1935, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was reactivated to transport personnel to Britain for training on the new cruiser , after which she was decommissioned and sold for breaking up as scrap.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Brisbane&quot; was built by Cockatoo Island Dockyard to the &quot;Chatham&quot; subtype of the Town class cruiser design. Laid down on 25 January 1913, the cruiser was launched on 30 September 1915 by the wife of Andrew Fisher; Prime Minister of Australia on three occasions. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 31 October 1916, although she was not completed until 12 December. The ship cost A£746,624 to build; unlike her Australian sister ships, the cost of adding armour was included in the original estimate.

She was long overall, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . The cruiser had a standard displacement of 5,400 tons. &quot;Brisbane&quot; was propelled by Parsons steam turbines, which provided to four propellers. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Brisbane&quot; once reached during full speed trials. Her standard cruising speed was , which could be maintained for . The ship was fuelled by a combination of coal (1,196 tons at full load) and oil (260 tons). Her ship&#x27;s company consisted of 31 officers and 454 sailors.
The cruiser&#x27;s primary armament consisted of eight BL Mk XI* guns, arranged in single mountings behind open-backed gunshields. A single quick-firing gun was used to protect the ship from air attack. &quot;Brisbane&quot; carried a 12-pounder field gun for ashore deployment. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. Ten .303-inch machine guns were carried for close defence work (eight Lewis guns and two Maxim guns). Two submerged 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes were fitted: one on each side, firing broadside. Armour plating consisted of side belts thick amidships, tapering to thick at the bow and stern, along with protective decking over the engineering and magazine spaces, and an armoured conning tower.

==Operational history==
On 13 December 1916, &quot;Brisbane&quot; departed on a voyage to the Mediterranean. After reaching Malta on 4 February, the ship was fitted with equipment not available in Australia at the time. Soon after, the ship was redeployed to Colombo, and employed on Indian Ocean patrols to search for the German raiders &quot;Wolf&quot; and &quot;Seeadler&quot;.

In February 1917, a Sopwith Baby seaplane was acquired from for reconnaissance work; the first aircraft to be used by a RAN ship. This remained aboard until June, when &quot;Brisbane&quot; was sent back to Australia with orders to patrol the Western Australian coast. From October 1917, the cruiser was assigned to operations in the western Pacific in response to reports of German raider activity. Initially deployed to the Solomon Islands, &quot;Brisbane&quot; visited Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, and Fiji, before returning to duties in Australian waters in January 1918.

On 21 October 1918, &quot;Brisbane&quot; departed for the eastern Mediterranean, and was between Colombo and Suez when World War I ended. The battle honour &quot;Indian Ocean 1917&quot; recognises the cruiser&#x27;s wartime service. The ship reached Murdos in late November, and spent most of December operating with the Australian Destroyer Squadron, before visiting Smyrna and the Dardanelles.
&quot;Brisbane&quot; reached the United Kingdom before the end of December 1918, and began refitting at Portsmouth. The most visible aspect of the refit was the installation of a tripod mast. The cruiser remained in British waters until 17 April 1919, when she departed from Portsmouth for home. During the return trip, she caught up with the submarine depot ship and the six J class submarines transferred from the Royal Navy to the RAN after the war, and relieved as their escort. was experiencing problems, and &quot;Brisbane&quot; took the boat under tow: the two vessels reached Sydney on 27 June. The cruiser operated in Australian waters until 4 August 1922, when she was decommissioned into reserve.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; was reactivated on 14 April 1923. On 23 July 1924, she ran aground off Port Moresby, New Guinea; she was refloated later that day. From February until August 1925, the ship served with the Royal Navy&#x27;s China Squadron as part of an exchange, with sent to Australia. While deployed with the China Squadron, &quot;Brisbane&quot; became the first RAN ship to visit Japan. The cruiser was placed back in reserve on 7 October, underwent a refit, and recommissioned on 17 November as a training ship attached to Flinders Naval Depot. A longer period of decommissioning and refit ran from 30 October 1926 until 28 June 1928, when she resumed training duties. In August 1928, &quot;Brisbane&quot; visited Hawaii, and was present for celebrations commemorating the 150th anniversary of the islands&#x27; discovery. The cruiser was again decommissioned, on 16 August 1929.

&quot;Brisbane&quot; was commissioned for the final time on 2 April 1935, for the specific purpose of conveying the ship&#x27;s company of the new cruiser to their ship in Britain. During the voyage, the cruiser assisted the British sloop . &quot;Brisbane&quot; reached Portsmouth on 12 July 1935, and was decommissioned on 24 September. She was the last coal-fuelled cruiser operational in any British Empire navy. On 13 June 1936, &quot;Brisbane&quot; was sold to Thos. W. Ward for A£19,215 to be broken up. The cruiser was scrapped at Briton Ferry, Wales by the end of 1936.

<text>Virginia Gentleman is a brand of bourbon whiskey distilled in Kentucky and re-distilled in Virginia. The brand&#x27;s motto was &quot;The Aristocrat of Them All&quot; (sometimes rendered as &quot;The Aristocrats of Them All&quot; when advertised with Smith Bowman Distilleries&#x27; Fairfax County Bourbon).

==Products==
Virginia Gentleman is an 80-proof (40 percent alcohol) whiskey. The distillery also offers a 90-proof small batch version. Both are triple-distilled. 

==History==
Virginia Gentleman&#x27;s producer, A. Smith Bowman Distillery, was founded in 1934 by Abram Smith Bowman and his sons, Smith and DeLong. It was originally based on the Bowman family&#x27;s Sunset Hills Farm in Fairfax County, Virginia, in what later became the planned community of Reston. In 1988, it relocated to Spotsylvania County, near Fredericksburg, into the former FMC Corp. cellophane plant. The distillery operated under the Bowman Family until 2003, when it was sold to Sazerac Company, an international beverage corporation based in Metairie, Louisiana. The company has since expanded its production into hot sauces and barbecue sauces under the Virginia Gentleman label.

Virginia Gentleman&#x27;s former label depicted a Revolution-era scene of two white men being served by a black footman (presumably a slave), all three in aristocratic dress, standing in front of a plantation-style manor. By at least the 1970s the label was redesigned with the black footman becoming white. Virginia Gentleman&#x27;s motto, &quot;The Aristocrat of Them All&quot;, was discontinued some time after, at least from appearing on the label. The label as of 2014 depicted three men in a similar arrangement, none of which are black or a servant.

<text>Richard Hall Stearns (25 December 1824 – August, 1909) was a wealthy tradesman, philanthropist, and politician from Massachusetts whose eponymous department store became one of the largest department store chains in Boston and the surrounding area.

The headquarters and main store was in the R. H. Stearns Building on Tremont Street near Park Street in Boston.

== Early life ==
Stearns was born in Ashburnham, Massachusetts on December 25, 1824.

Soon after his birth his family moved to New Ipswich, New Hampshire. At the age of seven, he was left an orphan and taken in and raised by his uncle on a farm in Lincoln, Massachusetts; from that age he earned his room and board with farmwork.

He was educated in district schools and attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts for one year. After his studies, he taught school.

==R. H. Stearns and Company==

In 1846 Stearns moved to Boston and worked in the store of C.C. Burr. A year later, Stearns opened up his own business in a small shop which later grew into a large store and Company, R. H. Stearns and Company.

R. H. Stearns and Company became a fixture in the downtown Boston shopping scene for over a century, and also opened a few branch stores in the greater Boston area. The store catered to the &quot;&quot; (well-off customers) and was particularly noted for its woman&#x27;s clothing, the stereotypical Stearns customer being a white-gloved older woman of subdued upper-crust demeanor, although well-crafted children&#x27;s items were also sold, as well as men&#x27;s clothing, silver and crystal – but not appliances.

In the early 1920s, R. H. Stearns and Company was bought by James Nelson and Bob Maynard. In the mid 20th century, Carl N. Schmalz (1898-1979), son of a general store owner in Huntley, Illinois, was president and later board chairman; Schmalz arranged the sale of the company to Edward Goodman, former president of Abraham &amp; Straus, in 1975. The business closed in 1978.

By the mid-1970s the changing face of the retail marketplace caught up with the store, and it did not have the financial backing like Filene&#x27;s or Jordan Marsh, who were both owned by large national retail holding companies. At the time of Stearn&#x27;s demise Filene&#x27;s was owned by Federated Department Stores, and Jordan Marsh was owned by Allied Stores.

R. H. Stearns and Co. filed for bankruptcy and closed all stores in 1977.

==Personal life and public service==
Stearns served in the Massachusetts Legislature for two years and also on the Boston Educational Board.

Stearns married Louise M. Waterman. His sons Frank Waterman Stearns and Richard Hall Stearns, Jr. (b. April 25, 1862) were members of R. H. Stearns and Company after R. H. Stearns&#x27;s death. Another son, William Foster Stearns (b. April 18, 1859;) was an 1882 graduate of Amherst College and a Congregational clergyman. There was another son, Frederick R. Stearns.

Stearns died in August 1909 in Poland Springs, Maine, at age 85 of natural causes.

<doc id="1175903" wikidata="Q2080574" url="?curid=1175903" title="Lalita Sahasranama">
<text>The Lalita Sahasranama () is a Hindu religious text that enumerates the thousand names of Mother Goddess Lalita, which are held sacred in Hinduism particularly in Shaktism, the tradition focused on the worship of the Divine Feminine (&quot;Shakti&quot;). The text is written in Sanskrit and is a part of the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, an ancient scripture that explores the cosmic creation and the divine order of the universe. The names describes the goddess&#x27; various attributes, accomplishments, and symbolism in the form of mantras usually chanted or sung as a hymn. 

Lalita Devi, often known as Tripura Sundari, is a form of Shakti worshipped as the beautiful consort of Lord Shiva and a significant deity in the Hindu pantheon. She is considered the supreme manifestation of feminine energy and is known as the epitome of beauty, grace, power, and compassion. She is also seen as the source of the creation, maintenance, and destruction of the universe, embodying the entire cycle of existence.

== Etymology and names ==

Etymologically, &quot;Lalita&quot; means &#x27;She who plays&#x27;. In its root form, the word &quot;Lalita&quot; means &#x27;spontaneous&#x27; which is implicitly extended to &#x27;play&#x27;. Her thousand names use occasional wordplay.

The names are organized as hymns, or &quot;stotras&quot;, but are often broken into mantras to represent all 1000 names. Therefore, the &quot;Sahasranama&quot; can be chanted in stotra form, or namavali form. &quot;The Lalita Saharanama&quot; is one of the only &quot;sahasranamas&quot; that has exactly 1000 names without repetition.

Generally, &quot;sahasranama&quot;s use the artifice of adding words like &quot;tu&quot;, &quot;api&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;, and &quot;hi&quot;, which are conjunctions that do not necessarily add to the meaning of the name except in cases of interpretation. The &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; does not use any such auxiliary conjunctions and is unique in being an enumeration of holy names that meets the metrical, poetical and mystic requirements of a &quot;sahasranama&quot; by their order throughout the text.

== Composition ==
&quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; is said to have been composed by the eight &quot;vaag&quot; devis (Vasini, Kameshvari, Aruna, Vimala, Jayani, Modini, Sarveshvari, and Kaulini) upon the command of the goddess Lalita herself. The text says that &quot;One can worship Lalita only if she wishes us to do so.&quot; This &quot;stotra&quot; occurs in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; (history of the universe) in the chapter of discussion between Hayagriva and Sage Agasthya in Kanchipuram. Hayagriva is an incarnation of Vishnu with the head of a horse and is held to be the storehouse of knowledge. Agasthya is one of the sages of yore and one of the stars of the constellation Saptarishi. At the request of Agasthya, Hayagriva is said to have taught him the thousand holiest names of Lalita. The temple at Thirumeyachur, near Kumbakonam, is said to be where Agastya was initiated into this &quot;sahasranama&quot;. An alternative origin is that the &quot;Upanishad Bramham Mutt&quot; at Kanchipuram is where this initiation happened.

== Structure ==
The verses (&quot;śloka&quot;) are organized in such a way that Devi is described from head to feet (&quot;keśādhipadam&quot;). There are basically five works (&quot;pañcakṛtya&quot;). They are creation (&quot;sṛṣṭi&quot;), protection (&quot;sthiti&quot;), destruction (&quot;saṁhāra&quot;), hiding (&quot;tirudhana&quot;) and blessing (&quot;anugrāha&quot;). Devi herself has been described as &quot;pañcakṛtya-parāyaṇa&quot; in the verse, and her five tasks are described as follows:

This means Devi is an aspect of Brahma while creating (&quot;sṛṣṭi&quot;), an aspect of Vishnu while sustaining (&quot;sthiti&quot;), and an aspect of Shiva during dissolution (&quot;sanghara&quot;). These five entities (Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Iśvara and Sadāśiva) are known as &quot;pañca-brahma&quot;, or the five Brahmas. Lalita has designated the five functions to these brahma. Sometimes, Devi will take away the life from these five Brahmas and make them inactive, performing all the five tasks herself. At that time, they will be called &quot;pancha preta&quot; that is lifeless bodies. The first three slokas are: Srimata (great mother) – srshti; Sri Maharajni (great ruler) – sthithi; Srimat Simhasaneswari (one who sits on the lion throne) – samharam. The rest of the slokas cover thirodhanam and anugraham.

The next names – &quot;&quot;chid-agni-kunda sambhootha deva-kaarya samudyatha&quot; tells us that the goddess arose from the fire of knowledge to help the gods in their war against the demon Bhandasura. From the verse - &quot;Udyad-bhaanu sahasraabha&quot; till &quot;shinjaana-mani manjeera manditha shri padaambuja&quot;, all her parts like her face, forehead, eyes, mouth, tongue, voice, hands and legs have been described. Thereafter, The goddess&#x27;s abode (Sri Chakra Nagara), her war against Bhandasura, Her use of the Kundalini Shakti, and her properties have been described. 

A common image of the goddess depicts a crowned beautiful woman, having a red complexion with three eyes, bedecked in red clothes and exquisite jewellery, adorned with kumkum, turmeric powder and a mangalsutra, having four hands which hold a noose, goad, flower arrows with a parrot sitting on it and a sugarcane bow, which represents the sweetness of her mind. She is seated on the throne named &quot;Chintamani&quot;, with her right leg on the ground, decorated with the Sri Yantra. The goddess is sometimes seated in the lap of her husband Shiva known as Kameshwara in this form, the legs of the throne are made of the bodies of the gods Brahma, Vishnu, Shankara and Rudra. On either side of goddess Lalita are the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati, as her servants. Her sons Ganesha and Kartikeya are seated on the base of the throne&#x27;s pedestal as her guardians. 

==Commentaries==
There are five known commentaries on the root text. These were written by:
* Vimarśānanadanātha, about 2,000 &quot;granthas&quot; (a verse containing 32 letters);
* Vidyāraṇya Munīśvara, about 1,500 &quot;granthas&quot;;
* Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa, about 2,500 &quot;granthas&quot;;
* Śaṅkara, mundane and not considered of much importance;
* Bhāskararāya, references the previous commentaries, esp. the first.

== Key concepts ==

=== Dhyana ===
The start of the &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; is characterized by the &quot;Dhyana&quot;, which are descriptive verses for visualization. There are four &quot;dhyana&quot; verses. It describes the yogi (the person reciting the &quot;Sahasranama&quot;) as meditating upon the form of Lalita and describes many of the qualities of the goddess. The &quot;Dhyana&quot; is said before chanting the thousand names.

The first verse starts with &quot;sinduraruna-vigraham&quot;&quot; and is most likely the verse composed by the eight &quot;Vaag Devi&quot;s. The second verse beginning with &quot;arunam karuna-tarangatakshim&quot; is said to have been composed by Dattatreya. The fourth, beginning with &quot;sakumkuma-vilepanam&quot;, was probably composed by Adi Sankaracharya. No known information is available on the origins of the third verse beginning with &quot;dhyayet padmasanastham&quot;. In all the &quot;dhyana&quot; verses there is a recurring theme on Devi&#x27;s red complexion, which is said to resemble the sun at dawn, and her compassionate nature.

=== Lalita ===
The &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; is organized in such a way that Devi is described from &quot;Head to Toe&quot; (&quot;Kesadi Padam&quot;). The names then go on to extoll Devi in all her achievements, powers, and forms.

==== Physical description ====
The &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; goes into great detail describing the physical aspect of the goddess. The beginning of the &quot;Sahasranama&quot; describes Lalita in her female form, &quot;Kameshvari&quot;, along with her consort, &quot;Kameshvara&quot;. &quot;Kameshvari&quot; is described as extremely beautiful, having dark thick long hair adorned with champaka, &quot;ashoka&quot;, &quot;punnaga&quot; and &quot;saugandha&quot; flowers (13), having a musk tilak on her forehead (16), and having eyebrows which appear as if they are the arch gates of Kamadeva&#x27;s abode (17). The next few mantras continue describing Lalita Devi as the ideal feminine form whose splendor is unmatched by any other celestial: with cheeks that shine like a mirror of Padmaraga (23), having beautiful white teeth resembling the &quot;shodasakshari&quot; mantra (25), and having a voice sweeter than the sound emanating from &quot;Kachchapi&quot;, the veena of Saraswati. The last mantra describing Devi&#x27;s physical appearance is the 46th name, &quot;&quot;sinjana mani majira mandita sripadambuja&quot; (whose feet are adorned with musical anklets filled with gem stones).

==== Kameshvara and Kameshvari ====
The next few names then continue to focus on the union between Lalita as &quot;Kameshvari,&quot; and &quot;Kameshwara&quot;. Devi is described as having a beautiful smile (28), beautiful breasts (33), and perfect thighs (39) which steal the heart of Kameshvara; she wears a mangal sutra and necklaces (30), with succeeding names describing the lower half of Devi&#x27;s body to her feet. This divine couple continues to stay united throughout the &quot;Sahasranama&quot;; the penultimate name is &quot;sivasakti aikya rupini&quot;&quot; (who is the unification of Siva and Shakti). As per Hindu philosophy, it is understood that there is nothing beyond this union of Siva and Shakti, or the Absolute form, except the true goddess Lalita herself. This is why the last name of the &quot;Sahasranama&quot; is &quot;&quot;Lalitambika&quot;&quot;&quot; effectively showing that Devi&#x27;s form as &quot;Lalitambika&quot; is her most absolute form.

=== The City of Sri Nagara ===

==== Origins ====
At the behest of name 57, the divine city of &quot;Sri Nagara&quot; is described in all its splendor. The origins of the city can be traced to two different texts. One is in Durvasa&#x27;s &quot;Lalithastavaratna&quot;, saying that &quot;Sri Nagara&quot; was constructed by celestial architect Visvakarma. The other, in the &quot;Rudra Yamala&quot; (as told to &quot;Parvati&quot; by &quot;Shiva&quot;), says that &quot;Sri Nagara&quot; is in the midst of an ocean of milk as an island called &quot;Ratnadvipa&quot; (island formed out of precious gems). This description fits name 61, &quot;sudha sagara madhyasta,&quot; which describes Devi as residing in the middle of the ocean of nectar.

==== Description ====
&quot;Sri Nagara&quot; is surrounded by twenty five walls, each wall representing a tattva. &quot;Sri Nagara&quot; has 25 streets circling it, made of elements, gems, and precious stones. In the eighth street is a forest of kadambas presided by &quot;Mantrini (Matangi)&quot; (60). On the fifteenth street resides the eight directional guardian deities. In the sixteenth resides Varahi(alias Dandini or Dandanatha) who was Lalita&#x27;s commander in chief in her battle with Bhandasura. In the seventeenth street resides the different &quot;Yoginis&quot;. In the eighteenth street resides Maha Vishnu. In the nineteenth street resides &quot;Esana&quot;, in the twentieth resides Tara Devi, in twenty first resides Varuni, in the twenty second resides Kurukulla who presides over the fort of pride, in twenty third resides Marthanda Bhairava, in twenty fourth resides the moon, and in the twenty fifth resides Manmatha presiding over the forest of love.

In the center of &quot;Sri Nagara&quot; is the &quot;Maha Padma Atavi&quot; (59), the forest of the Great Lotuses, and within it the &quot;Chintamani Griha&quot; (57), a palace constructed out of Cintamani, the wish fulfilling gem. The palace is said to be on the northern side of &quot;Sri Nagara;&quot; to its north east is the &quot;Chid-agni kunda&quot; and on both sides of its eastern gate are the houses of &quot;Mantrini&quot; and &quot;Dandini&quot;. On its four gates stand the &quot;Chaduramnaya&quot; gods for watch and ward.

The Sri Chakra and Lalita herself are said to reside within the &quot;Chintamani Griha&quot;. The chakra is said to be made up of the following components, all represented in its decorative features: the square representing &quot;Trilokya Mohanam&quot; (Devi as the most beautiful in the three worlds), the sixteen petaled lotus called the &quot;Sarvasa paripoorakam&quot; (Devi as the fulfiller of all desires), the eight petaled lotus called the &quot;Sarvasamksopanam&quot; (Devi as the cleanser), the sixteen cornered figure representing &quot;Sarva Saubhagyam&quot; (luck), the external ten cornered figure called the &quot;Sarvartha Sadhakam&quot; (Devi as the giver of all assets), the internal ten cornered figure called &quot;Sarva Raksha Karam&quot; (Devi as the protector), the eight cornered figure called the &quot;Sarva Roga Haram&quot; (Devi as the cure to all diseases), the triangle called the &quot;Sarva Siddhi Pradam&quot; (Devi as the giver of all powers), and the central dot known as the &quot;Sarvananda Mayam or the Bindu&quot; (Devi as pleasure). In the center of the Chakra, on the throne of the &quot;Pancha Brahmas&quot; (58) on the &quot;Bindu Peeta&quot; (380) sits Maha Tripura Sundari.

=== Bhandasura ===
One of the main events extolled in the &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; is Devi&#x27;s battle with the asura Bhandasura. According to the story, the &quot;devas&quot; prayed to Devi to kill Bhandasura. As she started for war, the &quot;Sahasranama&quot; describes her as being accompanied by the powers of various shaktis and devis whose accomplishments are extolled in different names. Names in the &quot;Sahasranama&quot; describes &quot;Sampatkari Devi&quot; as the captain of the elephant regiment (66) and &quot;Aswarooda Devi&quot; as the captain of the cavalry (67). Lalita as Para Shakti herself is described as riding in the Sri Chakra Chariot (&quot;chakraraja&quot; or the king of chariots) in name 68. After descriptions of the battle with respects to the various shaktis, Lalita is described as decimating Bhandasura&#x27;s army using the &quot;Paashupathastra&quot; weapon (81), and destroying him and his city with the &quot;Kameshvarastra&quot; weapon (82). After praises from the devas (83), she is said to have then gave life back to Manmatha (Kamadeva) for the good of the world (84).

=== The Five Works of God and the Trimurti ===
In the &quot;Lalitha Sahasranama&quot;, Devi herself has been described as &quot;pancha krtya parayana&quot; (274). This is in reference to the five works of God (&quot;pancha krtyam&quot;): creation (&quot;srishti&quot;), protection (&quot;sthiti&quot;), destruction (&quot;samharam&quot;), hiding (&quot;tirodhanam&quot;) and blessing (&quot;anugraham&quot;). The mantras preceding name 274 describe Devi in reference to the Hindu trinity:

Devi is therefore described as an aspect of Brahma while creating (&quot;srishti),&quot; an aspect of Govinda (Vishnu) while sustaining (&quot;sthiti),&quot; an aspect of Rudra (Shiva) during dissolution (&quot;samhara),&quot; an aspect of Ishvara while concealing (thirodana), and an aspect of Sadashiva while blessing (liberating). These five entities (Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadashiva) are known as &quot;pancha-brahma&quot; and &quot;pancha-preta.&quot; The goddess is described as &quot;pancha-brahma swarupini&quot; (she whose form is composed of the five Brahmas) in name 250. Such mantras are interpreted by many &quot;Shakti-ite&quot; scholars to show that Devi&#x27;s power is at par with, if not superior, to the powers of the trimurti. This idea is furthered by other mantras like &quot;Om panca preta manchadi sayinyai namah&quot;&quot; (who reclines on a couch made of the Five Corpses) in mantra 947; this most likely references the concept of the five &quot;Brahmas&quot; as lifeless bodies when Devi performs all the five tasks, mentioned previously, herself.

=== The Yoginis ===
The first 60 names from 475 to 534 discuss the seven &quot;chakra&quot;s of &quot;kundalini&quot; &quot;and sahasrara&quot;. Each &quot;chakra&quot; is presided over by a deity called a &quot;yogini&quot; (with seven in total)&quot;.&quot; Lalita herself is described as being present in the form of the &quot;kundalini&quot; energy (the divine feminine energy at the muladhara chakra at the bottom of the spine). Since the &quot;kundalini&quot; energy has to transcend the other chakras to reach &quot;the sahasrara&quot; chakra (a representation of Siva or the divine masculine energy) from the &quot;muladhara chakra&quot;, worshipping the respective &quot;yoginis&quot; of each chakra is paramount. Each of these &quot;yogini&quot;s have their own mantras describing their complexion, armories, qualities, and sacred foods within the &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; as a whole.

<text>Jesper Bo Parnevik (; born 7 March 1965) is a Swedish professional golfer. He spent 38 weeks in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking in 2000 and 2001.

==Early years and amateur career==
Parnevik was born in Botkyrka, Stockholm County, and is the son of Swedish entertainer Bosse Parnevik and his wife Gertie (b. 1940). He grew up in Åkersberga.

Parnevik became a member of the first group of students in Sweden to combine studying with golf training at the Swedish upper secondary sports school in Danderyd outside Stockholm. At age 15, Parnevik spent 10 days in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and developed an appreciation for life in the United States; he later moved to Palm Beach County, Florida, to attend Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth on a golf scholarship.

Parnevik was a member of the team representing Sweden at the 1984 and 1986 Eisenhower Trophy. He was also part of the Swedish team finishing second, after losing in the final against Scotland, at the 1985 European Amateur Team Championship on home soil in Halmstad, Sweden, where Parnevik won individually at the initial qualifying stroke-play competition.

==Professional career==
Parnevik turned professional in 1986. After winning the Swedish Golf Tour Order of Merit in 1988, including a runner-up finish to Vijay Singh at the 1988 Swedish PGA Championship, he scored four wins on the European Tour. His breakthrough came when he out-dueled Payne Stewart at the 1993 Scottish Open at Gleneagles King&#x27;s Course.

With victories in 1995 and 1998, Parnevik became the first Swede to win twice on the European Tour on home soil. At his first victory at the Scandinavian Masters in 1995 at Barsebäck Golf &amp; Country Club, he played 72 holes competition and 18 holes pro-am without a bogey, but with one double-bogey.

Based in Florida, he joined the PGA Tour in the mid-90s, subsequently winning five events. His playing career also includes three Ryder Cup appearances (1997, 1999, and 2002) and two runner-up finishes in The Open (1994 and 1997). His career best world ranking of seventh, which he attained on 14 May 2000, was the highest world ranking achieved by a Swedish golfer until Henrik Stenson reached the top five in February 2007.

In late 2000, Parnevik underwent hip surgery at the persuasion of Greg Norman, who had undergone similar surgery.

Parnevik finished second in the Valero Texas Open in October 2007, losing to Justin Leonard in a playoff. In 2009, after a tie for 17th at the SAS Masters in Sweden, Parnevik underwent further hip surgery in Vail, Colorado, United States, which cut short his 2009 season on the PGA Tour. He also cited the hip injury as the reason for his withdrawal from the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament (&quot;Q-School&quot;) in December 2009.

In 2010, Parnevik missed cuts in his first three tournaments and had to withdraw again after a first round 68 at the Northern Trust Open because of an ailing back. He had emergency surgery where it was discovered that he had a broken lumbar vertebrae that could put his career in jeopardy.

Parnevik played the 2011 PGA Tour season on a fully exempt status for his Top 50 All-Time Earnings ranking. He was allowed to reuse this one-time exemption after being able to play only five tournaments in 2010. He played the 2012 and 2013 seasons on a Medical Extension after suffering a severe injury to his right hand in a boating accident. Despite his limited play, Parnevik made news in 2013 after bogeying the 18th hole at the RBC Heritage, which allowed a record-tying 91 players to make the 36 hole cut.

Plagued by injuries for years, Parnevik staged a comeback on the Champions Tour when he became eligible in 2015. He started 2016 with a tie for third at the Chubb Classic, losing out to former world number one golfers Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples. He got his first win on the Champions Tour in the same year at the Insperity Invitational.

==Style==
Parnevik is known for his distinctive and eccentric taste in clothes and fashion as well as his playing achievements, a fashion sense that led golf writer Dan Jenkins to describe him as &quot;the last guy to climb out of the clown car at the circus&quot;. His on-course trademark was the upturned bill on his baseball cap. While on the European Ryder Cup team, he received a customized team cap with the Ryder Cup logo on the bottom of the bill instead of the front, so that it could be seen with the bill turned up. He has since stopped wearing the flipped-bill hat, opting for strawhats and visors but retains a flamboyant sense of fashion, such as disco-style purple trousers and other golf apparel designed by Johan Lindeberg. He has been politely described as &quot;eclectic&quot;, and has been known to change outfits at the halfway stage of a round of tournament golf. Beginning in 2006, one of his new on-course fashion statements was a necktie worn under a vest. Puma Golf signed Jesper Parnevik in 2014 and he gets credited for his influence on their LUX Golf Appearel Line. Since wearing Puma Clothes he once again wears a custom made and more modern looking flipped bill hat. He is also known to eat volcanic dust as a dietary supplement. Parnevik&#x27;s nickname on tour is &quot;Spaceman&quot;.

==Awards, personal life==
In 1998, Parnevik was awarded honorary member of the PGA of Sweden.

He was awarded the 1999 Swedish Golfer of the Year.

In 2003, the three Swedish teammates of the victorious European Ryder Cup team the previous year, Niclas Fasth, Pierre Fulke and Parnevik, was each, by the Swedish Golf Federation, awarded the Golden Club, the highest award for contributions to Swedish golf, as the 30th, 31st and 32nd recipients.

In 2023, he was inducted into the Swedish Golf Hall of Fame.

Parnevik has an eclectic acting career, including a cameo in the 2007 comedy, &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Caddy&quot;, in which he plays himself.

Parnevik is credited with having introduced fellow professional golfer Tiger Woods to Swedish au pair Elin Nordegren (previously employed by Parnevik), whom Woods eventually married. Parnevik subsequently stated in 2009 that he regretted his responsibility for this introduction after reports of Woods&#x27; infidelity surfaced that year.

Parnevik and his family starred in a reality TV show, &quot;Parneviks&quot;, which aired on TV3 in Sweden for four seasons from 2015 to 2018, giving insights into his life in Florida. He is married to Mia Parnevik (née Sandsten 1968), and they have three daughters and one son. His oldest daughter Peg Parnevik has a career as a pop singer. Another daughter, Penny, is married to former NHL ice hockey player Douglas Murray. His son Phoenix is named after Parnevik&#x27;s first PGA Tour win at the 1998 Phoenix Open.

Parnevik has a waterfront home in Tequesta, Florida.

<text>Pacific Comics was a comic book distributor and publisher active from 1971 to 1984. The company began as a San Diego, California, comic book shop owned by brothers Bill and Steve Schanes, later moving into comics distribution and then publishing. 

As a publisher, starting in 1981, Pacific took early advantage of the growing direct market, attracting a number of writers and artists from DC Comics and Marvel Comics to produce creator-owned titles, which were not subject to the Comics Code, and thus were free to feature more mature content.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1971, the Schanes brothers (Steve Schanes, age 17, and Bill Schanes, age 13) co-founded Pacific Comics, which started out as a mail-order company, selling to consumers via advertisements in the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. This led to ads inside some Marvel comics, and ultimately to tangible retail stores. The first Pacific Comics store opened in Pacific Beach, California, in 1974, and business was soon doing so well that the brothers realized they &quot;couldn&#x27;t get merchandise&quot; for the stores, and so set up a distribution system, which was soon supplying neighboring stores also.

The move from newsstand distribution to the direct market (non-returnable, heavily discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) happened in the 1970s, in large part due to the work of Phil Seuling and his Sea Gate Distributors company (founded in 1972), as well as a number of individuals, including the Schanes brothers and Bud Plant. The direct market went hand-in-hand with the creation of specialist comics shops to cater to the collectors who could then buy back issues months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. By the late 1970s, thanks partly to the success of films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, comics were selling well, and Pacific expanded its distribution system nationwide, raising $200,000 by closing its four San Diego retail locations and selling off inventory, rising rapidly to the top of the new distribution system.

In the six years between 1974 and 1980, comic or fantasy-related specialty shops rose from numbering 200–300 to around 1500, while Pacific was operating out of a office warehouse in Kearny Mesa, with 500 wholesale accounts. According to elder brother Steve, the company &quot;grossed just under a million dollars that year,&quot; soon doubling its floorspace.

=== Publishing ===
In 1979, Pacific dipped its feet into publishing when they released &quot;Warriors of Shadow Realm&quot;, a John Buscema portfolio of six signed, colored plates meant to accompany a Doug Moench and Buscema three-issue Weirdworld epic-fantasy tale which ran in &quot;Marvel Comics Super Special&quot; #11-13 (June-Oct. 1979).

In 1981, rival distributor Capital City launched a black-and-white title, &quot;Nexus&quot;, and distributed it through their own system. The Schanes brothers took note, and decided to follow suit, even though they were still paying off debt from a $300,000 bank loan taken out in 1979 at 25 percent interest. Steve — who, with a degree in sculpture had a background in art — handled negotiations with creators, while Bill took on the business and accounting end. The brothers turned to Jack Kirby. Steve Schanes recalled, &quot;I figured if you want to get people&#x27;s attention with a new comic book, who better to do it with than the King of Comics, Jack Kirby! We were already friends with Jack. We used to send him free copies of comics he&#x27;d drawn for other publishers because they never sent him any! So I just went ahead and called him on the phone, and he turned out to be a nice guy, completely accessible. ... We negotiated a whole detailed publishing deal between the two of us. No middlemen.&quot;

The Schaneses asked Kirby, who had effectively quit comics in 1978, for only the publishing rights, assuring him that he could keep full ownership and copyrights, and said they would even help him license characters for use overseas or in other media. Thus, Pacific claims to have become the first company to pay royalty payments to Kirby. Kirby provided Pacific with &quot;Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers&quot;, which was published bimonthly from August 1981. Though the Schaneses anticipated sales of less than 25,000, the first issue sold 110,000 copies. Kirby then let Pacific publish his &quot;Silver Star&quot;, and the brothers decided to start a line of full-color mainstream comic books.

Before long, Pacific had attracted interest from other comics professionals, including Mike Grell (who recalls that he was actually the first to sign with Pacific by a couple of weeks, but that Kirby&#x27;s work was published first because he &quot;delivered his first.&quot;) who had planned his &quot;Starslayer&quot; to appear from DC, but after it dropped from the schedule, the Schaneses approached him about publishing it.

Another invitee was then-aspiring artist Dave Stevens, who purchased comics from Pacific&#x27;s shops and had met the brothers at San Diego Comic-Con in 1981. When &quot;Starslayer&quot; #2 came up short a few pages, Stevens was approached to fill in the remaining pages, and ultimately came up with &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;.

=== Experimentation and expansion ===
In 1983 Pacific upgraded to paper with higher quality ink. Pacific&#x27;s innovations in creator-owned properties and high-quality printings were soon imitated by industry leaders DC Comics and Marvel Comics.

Pacific continued to distribute and publish comics, running both operations from a San Diego warehouse to which they&#x27;d moved in July 1982. They also purchased a firehouse in Steeleville, Illinois and converted it into a distribution hub. It was also operating warehouses in L.A. and Phoenix at the time. Printing about 500,000 comic books every month, the Schanses employed around forty people at their San Diego operation alone, and were grossing over $3.5 million per annum.

The brothers hired their father, Steven E. Schanes, as financial vice president and their mother (Christine Marra) as office manager. Elder brother Paul &quot;Pablo&quot; worked in the financial records department, and sister Chris, an L.A.-based attorney, provided counsel on legal affairs.

=== Later output ===
Pacific&#x27;s published output contained editorials by David Scroggy, who had started as a comics retailer in 1975, and risen to general manager of Pacific&#x27;s four San Diego shops by the late 1970s. He helped to bring the reclusive Steve Ditko to Pacific.

Ditko&#x27;s Pacific offering &quot;Missing Man&quot; was previewed in &quot;Captain Victory&quot; #6, and then featured in issues of &quot;Pacific Presents&quot;. His work was scripted by Mark Evanier. Meanwhile, Pacific published a magazine-sized black-and-white reprint of Rog 2000 stories that John Byrne had done in the &#x27;70s for Charlton Comics, as well as a number of titles under its parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises. It also welcomed Bruce Jones to the company, and Sergio Aragonés and Mark Evanier&#x27;s &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;.

===3-D, Elric, and falling sales===
By 1984, Steve Schanes decided to bring back 3-D to comics, a fleeting trend in the 1950s that had then been stymied by poor printing separations. Ray Zone was hired to do the production, after he had successfully converted a Kirby image for Honeycomb cereal. Steve Schanes decided the 3-D book would be &quot;Alien Worlds 3-D&quot;, featuring the first published work of Art Adams, alongside John Bolton, Bill Wray and others. Sales on the expensively-produced comic, however, were poor, and sales all round were following suit. One-shots became more common, and tolerable sales on &quot;Elric of Melniboné&quot; stumbled when First Comics acquired the rights, putting Pacific in the awkward position of continuing as distributor on a comic from a rival publisher that they had helped promote.

=== Competition and collapse ===
After organizational difficulties pushed back the release of &quot;Starslayer&quot; by several months, Mike Grell decided to take his creator-owned property to First Comics, and a domino effect began to occur as the loss of a high-profile title to a rival publisher engendered bad industry PR, leading other creators to lose faith in Pacific.

More importantly, the distribution arm of Pacific was suffering serious problems, due in part to overly-generous credit extensions to retailers, which were not paid back as quickly as expected. Thus, Steve Schanes explained:
Pacific&#x27;s publication arm was also attracting competitors, and Pacific found itself distributing competitors&#x27; titles, including Kitchen Sink Press, Last Gasp (publisher), and Rip Off Press. With this in mind, other publishers—including Capital City (whose &quot;Nexus&quot; comic outsold several Pacific titles), , Aardvark-Vanaheim, Educomics, Quality, Eagle, Eclipse, First, Vortex, New Media, Fantagraphics, Mirage—feared that having Pacific, a rival publisher, as their distributor could result in their being cut off from comic shops. This likely played a factor in the multiple alternate distributors who came into being to compete with Pacific, until nearly a quarter of Pacific&#x27;s comic-shop accounts defected to alternate distributors in 1984, skipping out on paying Pacific for upwards of three months&#x27; worth of comic books.

At the same time, Pacific and parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises found themselves the target of lawsuits, including some dealing with foreign rights and royalties for Pacific-published creator-owned titles. In August 1984, with the company $740,000 in debt, the Schaneses informed their staff that they would all be out of work by September. According to Steve Schanes, Pacific&#x27;s publishing arm was still seeing profit at the time of the closure, but it was outweighed by the losses of the distribution arm, and he and his brother lacked the business expertise to sell off part of the business.

=== Liquidation ===
After the 1984 collapse of Pacific, many of its creator-owned publications moved to Eclipse Comics: Bruce Jones&#x27; &quot;Twisted Tales&quot;, &quot;Alien Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Somerset Holmes&quot;; Dave Stevens&#x27; &quot;Rocketeer Special&quot; and a one-shot of Mark Evanier/Sergio Aragones&#x27; &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;.

As Pacific went into liquidation in September 1984, Phil Seuling&#x27;s distribution company Sea Gate Distributors also closed down. Pacific&#x27;s distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by Bud Plant, Inc., and Capital City Distribution, who also opened an expanded facility in Seagate&#x27;s old space in Sparta, alongside the comic-book printing plant.

Steve Schanes and his wife, Ann Fera, subsequently founded Blackthorne Publishing, and Bill Schanes found employment with Diamond Comic Distributors.

<doc id="1175922" wikidata="Q888590" url="?curid=1175922" title="José María Linares">
<text>José María Linares Lizarazu (10 July 1808 – 23 October 1861) was a Bolivian lawyer and politician who served as the 13th president of Bolivia from 1857 to 1861. Commencing his political career at a young age, he emerged as a fervent advocate of free trade, liberalism, the exploitation of silver mines, and the establishment of a monopoly on mercury to facilitate the latter objective.

Linares served as Minister of the Interior and Foreign Relations in the third cabinet of José Miguel de Velasco, but due to differences with the &quot;Restoration&quot; movement, he had to go into exile in Spain. In 1848, he returned to his country and became the President of the Congress. He defended President Velasco against Manuel Isidoro Belzu, and after Velasco&#x27;s fall, he fled to Argentina and inspired various conspiracies against Belzu.

In 1857, he overthrew President Jorge Córdova, Belzu&#x27;s son-in-law, and assumed the presidency. Linares, Bolivia&#x27;s first civilian president, declared himself dictator in 1858 and confronted the power of the clergy and the military through a reform program. He repressed several uprising attempts, and in 1861, he was deposed by his own supporters and replaced by a triumvirate that sentenced him to exile. The former president fled to Chile, where he died shortly after his exile.

==Early life==

=== Family and education ===
José María Linares was born in , Potosí Department, in his family&#x27;s hacienda. Belonging to the noble and wealthy family of the Counts of Casa Real and Lords of Rodrigo in Navarre, Linares was related to the Spanish nobility. He was educated at the Royal and Pontifical University of San Francisco Xavier, in the city of Sucre.

=== Political baptism ===
Linares was seventeen years old when, on the night of 13 July 1825, a revolutionary movement erupted in the city of Potosí in support of Antonio José de Sucre and Francisco O&#x27;Connor, who were approaching the city as part of the Upper Peruvian campaign of the Bolivian War of Independence. Leaving his home, Linares joined the Patriot cause, which eventually succeeded in overthrowing the Spanish Royalists in Upper Peru. This moment served as Linares&#x27; first political involvement; after the revolution, he continued to support liberal movements, governments, and ideologies.

=== Physical appearance ===
Regarding his appearance, Carlos Walker Martinez describes Linares as possessing an imposing stature and a somewhat slender build. His nose, aquiline and well-defined, added to the distinguished impression; his forehead, broad and unmarked, was believed by Walker to have hinted at a lack of necessity to conceal his thoughts. His open mouth, consistently adorned with a smile, contributed to an inviting demeanor. His complexion bore a slightly dark hue due to his Andalusian heritage, and his eyes were deep and black. Linares is also noted by Walker as having had wide eyes when giving a speech, exhibiting an extraordinary brilliance that captivated onlookers.

==Political career==
In the final years of General Andrés de Santa Cruz&#x27;s administration, a powerful party emerged in Bolivia, the National Party, which did not support the Peru–Bolivian Confederation and openly conspired against its Protector. The revolution against him finally erupted at an inconvenient moment for Santa Cruz, leading to the loss of his control in Bolivia. Simultaneously, in Peru, the Chileans, under the command of General Manuel Bulnes, expelled Santa Cruz. The &quot;pronunciamientos&quot; of José Miguel de Velasco and José Ballivián took place on 9 February and 15 February respectively, and the Battle of Yungay on 20 January 1839. With Santa Cruz and his Confederation fallen, General Velasco rose to power. Around him, the most notable figures in the country gathered, including Linares. With them, an independent congress was established, contrasting sharply with previous assemblies.

This assembly, in stark contrast to Santa Cruz&#x27;s policies, completely reformulated the country&#x27;s governmental structure. Linares and his involvement in contributing to this constitution were applauded. His popularity increased significantly as a result, and after a short stint as Prefect of the Department of Potosí, he was called to assume the position of Minister of the Interior and Foreign Relations: &quot;In taking this measure,&quot; stated Velasco in a communication dated 16 November 1839, &quot;announcing to you your appointment, I have considered not only the notorious capacity and deep patriotism that you embody but also the outstanding and relevant services you have rendered to the cause of Bolivia&#x27;s restoration&quot;.

=== Minister of the Interior and Foreign Relations ===

Finding the country in a state of chaos, Linares had to contain the revolutionary attempts of General Ballivián and the former allies of the fallen Protector, who seized every opportunity to sway public opinion in their favor. Another crisis unfolded with Peru, where President Agustín Gamarra had plans to conquer Bolivia. Linares, in his function as Minister of the Interior and Foreign Relations, refused to ratify the humiliating treaties imposed by Peru, signed in 1829, and prepared for war. Gamarra responded by crossing the Desaguadero with a sizable army, militarily occupying the departments of La Paz and Oruro. Velasco and Linares did everything possible, with the support of the congress, to organize a resistance against the invading army. However, a revolutionary movement erupted in the south led by General Sebastián Ágreda, a supporter of Santa Cruz. Ballivián, in hiding but not defeated, raised arms in the same invaded departments; civil discord spread rapidly, and internal conspiracies hindered responses to external attacks. Velasco and his government, thus, collapsed, and on 10 June 1841, Linares was forced to resign. Public opinion, however, raised Linares&#x27; name amid the turmoil with honorable applause. Velasco was on the Argentine border with a respectable force he had managed to gather around him, preparing to meet Ballivián, who had already been proclaimed president by the revolutionaries. At that moment, Velasco received news that the common enemy, General Gamarra, was facing the Bolivian Army on the eve of a decisive battle. Velasco, with Linares&#x27; support, spontaneously decided to hand over his entire army to Ballivián, an act that proved decisive and culminated in the Bolivian victory on the fields of Ingavi on 18 November 1841.

=== Exile in Europe ===
Meanwhile, Linares embarked on a journey to Europe. There, he divided his time in exile between serious studies, to which he devoted himself, and family matters that required resolution before the courts of Navarre. The ancestral wealth of his affluent grandparents was at risk of falling into the hands of the local government. Lengthy legal disputes had unfolded in previous years, and now was the opportunity to bring them to a close. He obtained the reparations sought and regained possession of his property. The letters he wrote to his friends in America reveal the kind of studies that particularly occupied his time. Social science was the focus of his vigilance. Linares believed that he foresaw the coming revolution and studied it, using a &quot;sure scalpel to expose the deep wounds of European society&quot;. Subsequent events confirmed his assertions when the Revolutions of 1848 erupted.

==== Spain recognizes Bolivian independence ====
In 1847, while still in Europe, Linares received the appointment of plenipotentiary minister of Bolivia to Spain. Invested with this position, he negotiated a treaty of peace and friendship with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Spanish court, Don Joaquín Francisco Pacheco, in which the independence of Bolivia was recognized. However, this pact was not ratified by the Bolivian government because Manuel Isidoro Belzu refused to do so, considering it tainted since it had been negotiated by General Ballivián, who was now out of favor. During Linares&#x27; absence, Bolivia had undergone drastic changes with violent reactions and acclaim for tireless &quot;caudillos&quot;. Having lost his popularity, Ballivián and his successor, Eusebio Guilarte, were overthrown by Velasco and Belzu. Once again acclaimed in the southern departments as the constitutional president, Velasco assumed the presidency while Belzu was appointed Minister of War. Linares returned to Bolivia after Ballivián&#x27;s fall and was elected President of the Bolivian Congress. According to the provisions of the 1839 Constitution, now in force, Linares was, &quot;de facto&quot;, the Vice President of Bolivia.

=== Relentless plotter ===
However, just a few months later, Belzu, who had contributed more than anyone to overthrow Ballivián and had initially supported Velasco&#x27;s proclamation, led a revolution in Oruro and proclaimed himself President of Bolivia. In the Battle of Yamparáez on 6 December 1848, Belzu defeated the government forces personally commanded by General Velasco, after a three-month campaign. Velasco, defeated, handed over the leadership of the constitutionalist cause to Linares. Soon thereafter, he became leader of the so-called &quot;Partido Generador&quot; (Generator Party), which advocated democracy, civilian control of politics, and a return of the Bolivian military to its barracks. This earned Linares the mistrust of most governments of the time (which were &quot;de facto&quot;), and a few stints in exile. Nevertheless, he became the country&#x27;s most important civilian and constitutionalist leader, with a growing following. Exiled from Bolivia, Linares spent almost a decade conspiring against the government of Belzu. His tireless conspiracies are described by Walker Martinez in the following words:One could see him in Salta gathering around him some outcasts and invading the borders of Bolivia, crossing rough roads, ravines, and deep rivers, vast deserts, and facing all kinds of dangers. Then, when Belzu&#x27;s forces shattered his weak and naturally ill-prepared armies in those improvised campaigns, and the triumphant leader believed his enemy was reduced to impotence and completely annihilated, he could be found on the shores of Chile, or on the coasts of Peru, weaving the threads of another revolution, gathering the broken and scattered fragments of Bolivia&#x27;s old parties, and arming his followers to attempt a coup. When his calculations failed again and when no hope seemed to remain amid the wreckage of his plans, his health, and his fortune, he would be found again in astonishment in Salta, in Tucumán, in Buenos Aires, in Copiapó, in Santiago, and in Tacna, always waging relentless war against his enemy, relentlessly pursuing the same object without deviating an inch from his goal.Juan Manuel de Rosas, at Belzu&#x27;s request, became involved in the matter. Linares was forced to reside in Buenos Aires and was subjected there for a year under the strictest surveillance. The Battle of Caseros on 3 February 1852, and the fall of Rosas freed Linares from his captors in Buenos Aires. Once free, he continued his relentless plots. In 1853, when he traveled from Salta to Valparaíso during the winter, a friend described the following: &quot;He had lost his beard and eyebrows in the ice of the mountains; his skin was so tanned that he seemed completely black, his lips torn apart, his nature, in short, shattered but not defeated&quot;. In his later years, the effects of these harsh and long journeys throughout South America manifested as severely compromised health.

==== Battle of Tupiza ====
Amidst the many small skirmishes and countless minor battles of that prolonged conflict, Linares arrived in the province of Chichas and reached Tupiza when least expected. He arrived in the evening and, without dismounting from his horse, spoke words that motivated his soldiers. The next morning, he prepared for battle because General Jorge Córdova was rapidly advancing against the revolution and was at the gates of the town. Three days later, the forces of both sides met on the fields of Mojo on 8 July 1853. Linares&#x27; forces could not defeat the seasoned Córdova, who triumphed against the rebels in twenty minutes. During the battle, the cavalry, which comprised the majority of the revolutionary forces, rode on horses not yet entirely tamed, leading to great disorder at the first cannon shots. The efforts of the leaders to restore the line and take timely action were in vain. Colonel Tejerina, the commander of those troops, in his despair, charged with only thirty men against Córdova&#x27;s unit and met his end amidst enemy bayonets. General Manuel Carrasco, upon witnessing the defeat, charged the enemy ranks, came within a few steps, fired his pistols, and fled. Among the other revolutionary leaders were the former president Velasco and Casimiro Olañeta.

=== Presidency of Jorge Córdova and the Oruro Revolution ===
However, while these campaigns had failed, they were not in vain because they achieved the objective–to wear down Belzu. Over the course of nine years, Linares had launched thirty-three revolutions against the government of Belzu. None of these culminated in the overthrow of Belzu. Yet, they the tired &quot;caudillo&quot; did not wish to continue policing Linares&#x27; revolutionary activity. Weary of the struggle, the leader surrendered and handed over command to his son-in-law, General Córdova. In his message to the Congress of 1855, Belzu stated: &quot;I solemnly protest that no consideration will compel me to continue holding an office that has become unbearable, absolutely unbearable, yes, a thousand times unbearable!&quot; After Belzu&#x27;s resignation, the &quot;belicista&quot; party organized the General Elections of 1855, where Córdova emerged as the winner and Linares in second place. Córdova received 9,388 votes, Linares 4,119, Celedonio Ávila 300, and Gonzalo García Lanza 282. The General Elections of 1855 inaugurated Córdova as Constitutional President, although Linares and his followers did not view this result as legitimate. Believing the election results to have been manipulated, Linares&#x27; conspiracies continued inside and outside Bolivia. In the span of two years, Linares orchestrated over a dozen uprisings. In 1855, Córdova, who was rushing to campaign in the north and had barely returned to the capital, &quot;heard the distant clamor of the insurgents in the southern provinces&quot;. On the Argentine border, Linares staged three simultaneous revolutions against Córdova, while Oruro and La Paz were again targeted by attacks from Tacna. In December 1856, Linares crossed into Chile through the Copiapó mountain range and then to Tacna, where he arrived in mid-1857. At that time, he had received reliable reports on the internal situation of Bolivia, knew how much the demoralized government of Córdova had fallen into disrepute, and judged the occasion opportune to overthrow the &quot;belicista&quot; regime. Linares launched his coup in Oruro, on 8 September 1857.

The news of the Oruro Revolution, which quickly spread from one end to the other of the Republic, sparked a massive uprising against Córdova. Two causes contributed to this: Córdova&#x27;s lack of popularity and the constitutionality of the &quot;Partido Generador&quot;, considered by some as the legal continuation of Velasco&#x27;s government. The masses saw Linares as the legalist cause, tired of the &quot;caudillismo&quot; and internal wars that had plagued Bolivia for decades. Linares&#x27; cause obtained eighty thousand signatures on its revolutionary acts, legitimizing his coup against Córdova. Once Oruro fell into Linares&#x27; hands, the revolutionary fervor in the rest of the country grew exponentially. Linares headed towards Cochabamba, whose entire population rebelled under the command of General Dámaso Bilbao la Vieja, erecting barricades in the streets of the city and proclaiming the &quot;linarista&quot; cause. Córdova, along with General Ambrosio Peñailillo, led a respectable division from Sucre to eliminate the insurgents. A bloody battle ensued in the various attacks that Córdova launched upon Cochabamba. Amidst the smoke of battle, Linares encouraged his troops by example and word. His figure itself appeared before his troops in the midst of shrapnel bursts and gunpowder smoke. Córdova withdrew from the main square, and with his troops defeated in various encounters in other parts of Bolivia, he was forced to seek refuge on the borders of Peru. On 31 March 1858, months after overthrowing Belzu&#x27;s son-in-law, Linares declared himself dictator. His first acts as President were to abolish &quot;belcista&quot; fiscal policies regarding internal debt, a major problem for the government in the first forty years since Bolivian independence.

== President of Bolivia ==

=== Fiscal, structural, ecclesiastical, and judicial reforms ===
During Linares&#x27; government, a movement of constitutionalist civilians known as the &quot;rojos&quot; emerged. This movement included politicians like Mariano Baptista and Adolfo Ballivián, who later governed as president leading the &quot;Partido Rojo&quot; (Red Party). Prefectures and high administrative and judicial positions were occupied by individuals who shared Linares&#x27; &quot;regenerative&quot; ideology; they believed the country needed a radical reform to emerge from the chaos they perceived. His cabinet was formed as follows: finance, Tomás Frías; foreign relations and public instruction, Lucas Mendoza de la Tapia; development, Manuel Buitrago; war, General Gregorio Pérez; and government, cult, and justice, Ruperto Fernández. Later, the Ministry of Public Instruction was taken over by Evaristo Valle, and the Ministry of War by General José María de Achá.

The country&#x27;s finances, which were in ruins, quickly improved thanks to the strict austerity introduced in expenditures, and thus the national credit rose a few degrees from the deplorable state it was in. Although the 1860 expenditure budget, totaling 2,339,704 pesos, exceeded the revenues by 115,417 pesos, which was a huge deficit, Frías managed to balance expenses with revenues within a short time. To reduce spenditures, the army was reduced from 5,000 active personnel to just 1,500. Means were also sought to pay off the internal public debt, which had been completely forgotten until then; free export of gold and other metals was allowed, and Frías was tasked with drafting a mining code needed by the country. The &quot;quina&quot; bank was abolished, making the export of quinine open and easy for everyone; coins were introduced into circulation to remedy the circulation of weak currency, giving rise to the name &quot;pesos-Frías&quot;, named after the minister who designed them. Tariffs on imported foreign fabrics through Arica and Cobija were reduced; regulations for joint-stock companies were also determined; and, among many other measures, the realization of a loan of one million pounds sterling in Europe was initiated, intended for the canalization of the Desaguadero and the construction of a road that, starting from this point, would reach the Bolivian coast. This would bring the cities of La Paz, Oruro, and Potosí within reach of the sea. Linares&#x27; fall prevented the loan from being realized when the business was almost entirely concluded.

Regarding the reformation of the clergy, which was in a very low state, Linares applied liberal and secular ideas. Of these ecclesiastical reforms, Linares said the following: &quot;Given the powerful influence of the clergy among us, would the regeneration of the country be possible without its reform? No; and for this purpose, among other measures, I undertook the establishment of large seminaries... Seeing temples in ruins, others converted into pigsties, and the bride in rags and the concubine in finery, could I not be filled with indignation? I felt it because I am convinced of what corresponds to the greatness of the Being we worship in the temples and of how the poor state of it not only serves to cool devotion but also destroys the religious spirit&quot;. The action cost Linares a great deal of his popularity, since so many Bolivians, devoutly Catholic, saw the act as villainous.

The Ministry of Justice also implemented significant reforms during Linares&#x27; era. A new law on judicial organization came into effect, completely changing the old system. It established a court of cassation, three courts of appeals, and twelve district courts, each composed of three members and a prosecutor. A new criminal code was enacted, and various provisions were issued regarding the better organization of public offices, the creation of special commercial courts, salaries, and the accountability of employees, as well as regulations for the practice of law. The new territorial division and the organization of municipalities were another important reform during the Linares era.

=== Relations with Peru ===
The Linares administration was plagued with the same poor relations with Peru as had previous ones. The intrigues of Lima had a significant influence on the events in Bolivia, especially during the first forty years since independence. The armed interventions of both countries, such as the revolution of Chuquisaca in 1828 and Sucre&#x27;s resignation from the presidency of Bolivia, were strongly influenced by Peruvian politics and Gamarra&#x27;s invasion. The intrigues of Gamarra and Luis José de Orbegoso brought about the conflict with Felipe Santiago Salaverry and the creation of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. When Gamarra returned to power, he resumed hostilities with Bolivia, encouraging the ambitions of some political exiles. At the same time, he pretended to desire a diplomatic settlement that was never fulfilled. Linares, who at the time was Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs, was all too aware of the danger Gamarra posed and believed Lima&#x27;s intentions were deceitful. Despite the victory at Ingavi, defeating the Peruvian forces and the death of Gamarra, diplomatic hostilities persisted well into the Linares administration. Historian Ramón Sotomayor Valdés describes the tensions as follows: &quot;Since then, on Peruvian soil, a natural refuge for fugitives and emigrants from Bolivia, they found not only security but also facilities to conspire and constantly threaten the public order of their homeland. Bolivia soon adopted, in retaliation, this tactic, as it became a custom for dissidents from the government of one Republic to find in the government of the other an interested protector or a more or less decided accomplice&quot;. When Ballivián fell, a new conflict with Peru was lurking on the horizon; a conflict in which Bolivia planned to acquire the departments of Moquegua and Tarapacá, considered natural and almost necessary boundaries to complete Bolivian territory. Such territorial acquisitions were supported by Linares. Ramón Castilla, to assume the presidency of Peru, was aided by Belzu. Subsequently, Belzu and his supporters relied on Castilla to regain power. The distrust between Peru and Bolivia originated from these conspiracies between their respective diplomatic offices. When Castilla had come to rule in Peru, and although he was a friend of Belzu, he wanted to avenge Peru&#x27;s defeat at Ingavi for personal reasons. After Ingavi, Castilla was taken prisoner, transported to Oruro, then to Cochabamba, and finally to Santa Cruz, where he spent a year as a prisoner. Therefore, Castilla was planning another war with Bolivia by the time Linares had come to power in 1857. Tensions even after Linares was removed in 1861, relations remaining strained until 1867.

To put an end to the complaints from the Peruvian government, Linares sent Ruperto Fernández as a plenipotentiary to Lima. In January 1859, he carried out an agreement in which both governments committed to preventing any attempt at revolution and invasion in each other&#x27;s territory by political exiles. This agreement was particularly beneficial for Bolivia since, in the same days it was signed in Lima, open conspiracies were underway in Tacna and Puno with the purpose of invading Bolivian territory. Despite the agreement, the Peruvian government ignored these conspiracies and allowed the passage of Bolivian revolutionaries, who brought an armed force into Bolivia under the command of former President Córdova and General Ágreda. For this reason, the agreement was not accepted. Fernández, after demanding explanations about Castilla&#x27;s conduct without success, requested his passports and returned to La Paz. Linares then severed communications with Peru on 14 May 1860, and maintained an absolute interdiction, preparing for war and increasing its military forces. The situation became more strained for Bolivia since, being an isolated country, all its foreign consumer goods were imported through the port of Arica. Peru lost little to nothing, except for the maintenance of the army near the Bolivian borders, which, while primarily intended to monitor Bolivia&#x27;s government movements, also served to control the revolutionary advances of Arequipa and Cuzco, departments hostile to Castilla&#x27;s administration. Linares tried to remedy the import blockade by reopening trade between the two countries, while still maintaining severed diplomatic relations and continuing to strengthen his troops. His fixed and constant intention was to invade Peru sooner or later. He was pleased with the idea of completing the &quot;natural boundaries of Bolivia&quot; and carrying out the plan that Santa Cruz did not realize.

=== Revolutions against Linares ===
In August 1858, the first rebellion against Linares erupted in La Paz. The plan involved assassinating the dictator and immediately inciting a rebellion among the troops. To execute the plan, on the morning of 10 August, some rebels positioned themselves in the main square in front of the Palacio Quemado, others in the side street running south, and the rest were ready to assault the barracks at the opportune moment. As the commotion outside grew, Linares, who was at that moment in the palace hall facing the square, rushed to see what was happening, just as the revolutionaries gathered at the foot of the windows. Juan José Prudencio, a general loyal to Linares, who was with the dictator at the time, advanced toward balcony before Linares. At the moment he made this movement and just as he reached the railings, a rifle bullet pierced his chest, leaving him lifeless on the spot. Linares, eager to control the tumult with his presence, insisted on going out to the same balcony. But those with him prevented this. A few more bullets crossed the air, one of which fatally wounded the aide-de-camp, Colonel Viruet, who imprudently had leaned out of another window. The palace guard came out, opened fire on the rioters, and made them flee within minutes. Some of the accomplices of the crime were captured, necessary investigations were conducted, and after a process strictly adhering to the law, some were sentenced to death, including a Franciscan friar named Porcel, who had a questionable background. The fatal sentence imposed on the friar stirred compassion in some people who made vigorous efforts to have it suspended, considering he was a holy man. However, nothing succeeded in swaying Linares&#x27; will, as he refused to make a favorable exception for the friar, who, for the same reasons pleaded for his salvation, turned out to be the most criminal of the convicts. The friar was degraded according to the provisions of canon law and was promptly executed by firing squad.

The following year witnessed another revolution; Generals Córdova and Ágreda brought to Bolivia what was called called a c&quot;ruzada&quot; (Crusade), a curious name given to any invasion by political exiles to overthrow the established government. They brought men and war materials from Peru and crossed the border. Linares, who was then in Oruro and learned of the event, swiftly set things in motion. The two army forces, the revolutionaries and the government forces, met on the heights of La Paz on the same day, so that Córdova and Ágreda descended to the city from the northern hills at the same time that Linares descended from the road called &quot;&quot;de Potosí&quot;. The battle broke out on the slopes of the &quot;Calvario&quot;,&quot; ten or twelve blocks from the main square; it did not last long because the revolutionary forces were inferior, and they were completely defeated. The leaders fled to Peru. The government showed clemency towards the prisoners. In this revolution, it seems beyond doubt that Peruvian authorities played some part, at least tolerating and sympathizing with the preparations and leaders of the c&quot;ruzada&quot; by the &quot;belicistas&quot;. With these revolutions extinguished, the government appeared more powerful and stable than ever. Linares, after making a journey across the country, studying its geography, considered summoning Congress. He believed that to complete his &#x27;work,&#x27; it was necessary for him to account for his actions before the National Assembly.

== Overthrow, exile, and death ==
After continuous riots, conspiracies, and uprisings, it was finally on 14 January 1861, that Linares would be overthrown. Since dawn that day, vague and ominous rumors circulated in the city of La Paz, a peculiar and strange movement was noticed in the barracks, and more people than usual were seen entering and leaving the Palacio Quemado. No one knew what was happening, but Linares sensed something serious. The crowd roamed the square and on street corners to find out what was going on. Meanwhile, inside the palace, a different scene was taking place. Linares, in a low voice, read a communication that had just been delivered to him, bearing the signatures of his two ministers, Achá and Fernández, and the Inspector General of the Army, General Manuel Antonio Sánchez. The names at the bottom did not reveal the content of the writing. However, in a few lines, it stated that Linares had been removed from power. The crowd learned what was really happening when Linares, accompanied by a few friends, left the palace to seek asylum in a neighboring house. The rebellious battalions in the square proclaimed the triumvirate of Achá, Sánchez, and Fernández. Among the leaders who participated alongside the triumvirate were Narciso Campero, Plácido Yáñez, Adolfo Ballivián, and Benjamin Rivas. The treason of Linares&#x27; ministers marked the end of the &quot;linarista&quot; dictatorship. Known for his energetic and indomitable personality, Linares did not attempt to regain power as he was seriously ill. Although Linares did not react, the &quot;rojos&quot; proposed some counter-revolutionary plan to Frías, which, rather than being a well-thought-out plan based on solid foundations, was a generous suggestion with little chance of success. Frías did not deem it prudent to accept this futile sacrifice. Some leaders scattered in various military districts tried to unite for a joint action. However, these efforts did not succeed. With illness plaguing him, Linares had no choice but to go into exile. He left La Paz six days after his downfall, on 20 January 1861. Some loyal friends accompanied him to El Alto, bidding him farewell at the foot of the Illimani.

In his message addressed to the Congress of Bolivia, Linares expressed his wishes, ideas, and perspective about the country and its future:Sirs: Not because I harbor the desire to rule again, much less any sinister intention, do I address you today, for in uncorrupted hearts, there is no room for anything unworthy, and the leadership, while I had it, was for me nothing but a torment, to which I could only have resigned myself due to my ardent love for Bolivia and my eagerness to seek the common good. I exercise a right that I have not lost: I fulfill a sacred duty. I have been the leader of the beautiful September revolution and held the reins of government for more than three years. Since the age of seventeen, I have served our homeland, always forgetting myself and sacrificing for its happiness everything dear to a man. The object of my most fervent wishes will be its well-being as long as I live... I disregard pretense, detest hypocrisy, and truth in everything is the rule of my conduct, and in accordance with it, I am going to give an account of all my actions while I held power. The examination must be scrupulous and severe, and in your name, for Bolivia&#x27;s credit and the luster of the September revolution, I demand that you do so.Months after sending this letter, Linares died in Valparaíso on 23 October 1861, after his already declining health deteriorated. Mariano Baptista, the last politician who remained loyal to Linares until the end, was by his side.

<doc id="1175928" wikidata="Q1347030" url="?curid=1175928" title="Robert McHenry">
<text>Robert Dale McHenry (born April 30, 1945) is an American editor, encyclopedist, philanthropist and writer. McHenry worked from 1967 for Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. or associated companies, becoming editor-in-chief of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; in 1992, a position he held until 1997. McHenry is also author of the book &quot;How to Know&quot; (2004), and a frequent contributor to journals.

==Early life and education==
McHenry was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1966. He also received a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Michigan in 1967. Later in life, McHenry undertook further study at Northwestern University, where he graduated from Northwestern&#x27;s Kellogg School of Management with a Master of Business Administration in 1987.

==Editorial career==
McHenry&#x27;s career at Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. began in 1967. After two years, he transferred to San Francisco Productions to work for Mortimer Adler, where he co-edited (with Charles Van Doren) &quot;Webster&#x27;s Guide to American History&quot;, &quot;A Documentary History of Conservation in America&quot;, and &quot;Webster&#x27;s American Biographies&quot;. McHenry transferred in 1975 to G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (later renamed Merriam-Webster Inc.) where he edited &quot;Webster&#x27;s American Military Biographies&quot;, &quot;Famous American Women&quot;, &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Women&quot;, and &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Biographical Dictionary&quot;.

McHenry returned to Britannica in 1982 as editor of &quot;Compton&#x27;s Yearbook&quot;, which was an annual supplement to &quot;Compton&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;. McHenry later joined the editorial staff of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, initially as director of Britannica yearbooks, later progressing to become managing editor of the encyclopedia itself in 1986, general editor in 1990, and editor-in-chief in 1992.

McHenry played a key role in the launch in 1994 of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; in two electronic forms; a CD-ROM version, &quot;Britannica CD&quot;, and an Internet version, &quot;Britannica Online&quot;, which was the first Internet-based encyclopedia.

McHenry believes that Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages in the market for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the first multimedia encyclopedia (&quot;Compton&#x27;s MultiMedia Encyclopedia&quot;) as early as 1989, but did not launch &quot;Britannica CD&quot; until 1994, one year after Microsoft launched their &quot;Encarta&quot; encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance amongst senior management to fully embrace new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from door-to-door selling of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products, being driven by the desires of the sales personnel, rather than market conditions and customer expectations.

Aided by Britannica&#x27;s failings, Microsoft took a dominant position in the market for CD-ROM encyclopedias in the 1990s. McHenry had little respect for their achievement, which he believed to be the result of, not only large resources and wide market reach, but a &quot;casual disregard for quality work&quot;. In particular, in an article in 1996 (which the senior management at Britannica refused permission to publish) McHenry criticized Microsoft for its policy of having factually different versions of the same article in the various national issues of the encyclopedia. McHenry regarded this practice as &quot;pandering to local prejudices&quot; in order to suit local markets, instead of presenting subjects objectively.

McHenry was replaced as the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; by Dale Hoiberg in 1997.

==Life after Britannica==
In 1998, McHenry wrote the book &quot;How to Know&quot;, in which he explored the questions of what we can know and how we know that we know it. Though written in 1998, the book was not published until 2004.

During 2002 and 2003, McHenry worked part-time in a used-book store, and for a company producing Internet content-filtering software. During the same period, McHenry had several articles published in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; and &quot;The Vocabula Review&quot;. The articles were mainly about low standards in writing and verbal communication. One exception was a defence of Oprah&#x27;s Book Club, following hostile comments from some critics.

In 2004, McHenry began writing regularly for &quot;TCS Daily&quot; about a variety of issues. A favourite topic has been Intelligent design (ID), which he has criticized on several occasions. McHenry has argued that ID is not a theory in the scientific meaning of the word, because it is not based on evidence, it does not generate predictions, and thus cannot be tested. He has described ID as anti-science, because it begins with a conclusion, that some unknown things are unknowable, which is then supported by selected evidence. McHenry has argued that science is the engine of society and the root of economic success. He believes that ID supporters want to stop the engine, not just for themselves, but for everyone else. He views the support of politicians for ID as particularly dangerous.

McHenry has proposed two laws. McHenry&#x27;s First Law states that 88% of all human behavior amounts to shouting &quot;Hey! Look at me!&quot;. McHenry&#x27;s Second Law states that the flow of &#x27;information&#x27; expands to fill any available channel, while actual knowledge remains scarce and available only to those willing to work at it.

McHenry&#x27;s articles are normally critical in nature, though there is a humorous side to McHenry. One example was an article about his thoughts of the possible meanings of a &quot;No deadly weapons in building&quot; sign he had seen outside a public library. Another example was an article where he weighed up the pros and cons of a suggestion that candidates for the United States Congress be selected by lot, but every apparent con became a pro after further consideration.

McHenry&#x27;s most recent articles appear in &quot;The American&quot;, the online magazine of The American Enterprise Institute for which he became a contributing writer in July 2008.

===Criticism of Wikipedia===
In 2004, McHenry participated in a review of 7 Wikipedia articles of general interest, reviewing the entry for Encyclopedia, repeating his concerns about the entry&#x27;s usefulness and giving it a 5/10 rating.

In November 2004, McHenry wrote an article for &quot;Tech Central Station&quot; (later renamed &quot;TCS Daily&quot;) in which he criticized Wikipedia, a free-content encyclopedia that anyone can edit. In essence, McHenry&#x27;s main criticism was that Wikipedia was operating on what he believed was a false premise; that allowing anyone to edit articles, whether or not they were knowledgeable, would lead to evolution of article quality. Belief in the ability of Wikipedia to succeed, he argued, required a faith that &quot;some unspecified quasi-Darwinian process will assure that those writings and editings by contributors of greatest expertise will survive&quot;. A secondary criticism was that editors were being self-indulgent, because they spent time on minor alterations while leaving important factual inaccuracies in place, and thus were disregarding the needs of the readers. In a later article about Wikipedia, following the Seigenthaler incident, McHenry restated his earlier objections, and added a criticism that the Wikipedia organisation had been unable to respond adequately to the event.

McHenry&#x27;s articles about Wikipedia have produced responses from other writers. In a response to McHenry&#x27;s first article, Aaron Krowne of freesoftwaremagazine.com considered McHenry&#x27;s article to be an attack on the credibility of the commons-based peer production, for which he saw already strong evidence of success. In a response to McHenry&#x27;s later article, Tim Worstall, a fellow contributor to &quot;TCS Daily&quot;, argued that McHenry was wrongly assuming that the editorial process of traditional encyclopedias was effective in preventing inaccuracies. Worstall, drawing on his own experience as a contributor to traditional encyclopedias, argued that the editorial process often fails, because human nature leads editors to take the easy option of consulting other secondary sources, rather than take the extra effort to check primary sources. McHenry published responses to both of these articles.

<text>The Leadhills and Wanlockhead Railway is a narrow gauge railway in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is laid on the trackbed of the former Leadhills and Wanlockhead Branch of the Caledonian Railway which led off the main line between and Glasgow at Elvanfoot.

==Overview==
The preserved section runs from Leadhills for about towards Wanlockhead and is the highest adhesion railway in the UK. The rack and pinion Snowdon Mountain Railway is higher. Trains are currently diesel worked with the locomotive propelling the train up hill away from Leadhills.

The original railway closed in the late 1930s shortly after the mines in Wanlockhead had closed.

The railway currently stops at the border of South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway.



==Operation==
Trains operate on the push-pull principle as there are no run round loop facilities at the end of the run. Movements within the main station site at Leadhills are controlled from the reconstructed signal box which contains the original lever frame from Arrochar and Tarbet signal box.
===Bus replacement===
For two weeks during July 2016 the railway operated an extended service, connecting with local bus routes, as the road between Wanlockhead and Leadhills was closed for repairs.
===Awards===
The Leadhills &amp; Wanlockhead won the Heritage Railway Association Annual Awards 2016, Small Groups

<text>Boussingault is a large lunar impact crater that lies near the rugged southeast limb of the Moon. Because of its location, Boussingault appears highly oblong in shape due to foreshortening. To the southwest is the crater Boguslawsky, and almost attached to the northeast rim is Helmholtz. East-southeast of Boussingault lies the crater Neumayer.

The most notable aspect of this crater is the large crater that lies entirely within its outer walls, so that it resembles a double-walled formation. The outer rim is worn and Boussingault K lies across the northwest rim. To the northwest is the overlapping triple crater formation of Boussingault E, B, and C.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boussingault.

The group was founded in 1976 by Barbara Benary (who constructed most of the instruments), Philip Corner, and Daniel Goode. It is a composers&#x27; collective as well as repertory ensemble. Current composers in the group, in addition to the co-founders, are: David Demnitz, Laura Liben, Jody Kruskal, Lisa Karrer, Marnen Laibow-Koser, Jody Diamond, and David Simons.

Gamelan Son of Lion&#x27;s keyed instruments have bars constructed of iron, in the Javanese style. The group uses both the &quot;pelog&quot; and &quot;slendro&quot; tuning systems, sometimes in conjunction with one another within a single composition.

<text>Dariush Shayegan (;‎ 24 January 1935 – 22 March 2018) was one of the most consequential thinkers of contemporary Iran and the Near East.

== Life and career==
He was born in Tabriz from a Shia Iranian Azeri father and a Georgian Sunni mother; his mother descended from an aristocratic family from Georgia. Shayegan studied at the Sorbonne University in Paris. He was a Professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions at the Tehran University. Besides Persian, Shayegan wrote in French and English, and spoke fluently Georgian, Russian, and Turkish (both Ottoman and Azeri).. Having spent his teens at boarding school in Great Britain, Shayegan subsequently lived, during his formative years, in Geneva, where he read at the Université de Genève French literature, philosophy, Sanskrit, and political science. Shayegan received his doctorate (&quot;doctorat de troisième cycle&quot;) at the Sorbonne under the tutelage of his Doktorvater Henry Corbin, with a thesis entitled: &quot;Les relations de l&#x27;hindouisme et du soufisme d&#x27;après le &quot;Majma’ al-Baḥrayn&quot; de Dārā Shokūh.&quot;

Shayegan has written many pioneering works on the epistemological specificities of eastern and western cultures and the possibility of dialogue between them. He was the founding director of the Iranian Center for the Studies of Civilizations, which launched its work in 1977 with an international symposium on the &quot;dialogue between civilizations,&quot; a concept that has been selectively appropriated by the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. In 2009 Shayegan was awarded the inaugural Global Dialogue Prize, an international award for &quot;outstanding achievements in the advancement and application of intercultural value research&quot;, in recognition of his dialogical conception of cultural subjectivity (for a statement of the award committee and a scholarly presentation (including a fairly complete bibliography) of Shayegan&#x27;s contribution to intercultural dialogue, see the (copyrighted) webpages of this award.)

== Personal life ==
His son, M. Rahim Shayegan, is an American historian and expert in history of ancient Iran.

== Death ==
Shayegan died on 22 March 2018, at the age of 83 in Tehran.

<text>HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; (FFG 05) was an &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class guided-missile frigate of the Royal Australian Navy, which entered service in 1992. &quot;Melbourne&quot; has been deployed to the Persian Gulf on several occasions, and served as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce in 2000. On 26 October 2019, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was decommissioned from the RAN, subsequently being transferred to Chile. The ship was commissioned into the Chilean Navy as &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot; on 15 April 2020.

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the &quot;Perth&quot;-class acquisition (a derivative of the American &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyer) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates in 1976. A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth, with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships (including &quot;Melbourne&quot;) were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.
As designed, the ship had a full load displacement of 4,100 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion machinery consists of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provide a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed is , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors are used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . Standard ship&#x27;s company is 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters.

Original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. As part of the mid-2000s FFG Upgrade Project, an eight-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System was fitted, with a payload of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets are fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46, then the MU90 Impact following the FFG Upgrade. Up to six machine guns can be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts have been installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite includes an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and a Mulloka hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

The ship was laid down by AMECON at Williamstown, Victoria on 12 July 1985. She was launched on 5 May 1989. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 15 February 1992.

==Operational history==
In 1996, the frigate was deployed to the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 20 January to 23 February 2000.

In 2002, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in the third rotation of RAN ships to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Slipper, where she enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraq. In 2003, the ship returned to Iraqi waters in support of Operation Catalyst, protecting Iraqi territorial waters following Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was awarded the honours &quot;East Timor 2000&quot; and &quot;Persian Gulf 2002&quot;.

On 16 August 2010, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was deployed to the Middle East for the third time, again as part of Operation Slipper. During the six-month deployment, the frigate participated in anti-piracy operations in the Arabian Sea and responded to 14 distress calls from merchant vessels, including the British chemical tanker MV &quot;CPO China&quot; on 3 January 2011. Although it took six hours for &quot;Melbourne&quot; to close with &quot;CPO China&quot;, the merchant ship&#x27;s crew secured themselves in the citadel, and the pirates retreated when the frigate and her Seahawk helicopter arrived. &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Sydney on 18 February 2011.

Between 5 and 7 February 2014, while deployed off Tanzania, &quot;Melbourne&quot; seized and destroyed of heroin from smuggling vessels. On 18 February, while operating off Oman&#x27;s Masirah Island, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and the Pakistani frigate PNS &quot;Alamgir&quot; intercepted and boarded a dhow found to be carrying of cannabis resin. In September 2018 &quot;Melbourne&quot; operated off the Korean Peninsula to enforce sanctions against North Korea as part of Operation Argos.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Fleet Base East from her final deployment on 27 September 2019. She was decommissioned on 26 October 2019.

On December 27, 2019, it was announced that she and &quot;Newcastle&quot; had been sold to Chile.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; was commissioned into the Chilean navy on 15 April 2020 as Chilean ship &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;, pennant number FFG-14.

<text>HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; was a Town class light cruiser operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The ship was laid down by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead in England in 1911, launched in 1912 and commissioned in 1913. At the start of World War I, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was involved in attempts to locate the German East Asia Squadron, and participated in the capture of German colonies in the Pacific, before being assigned to the North America and West Indies Stations. In 1916, the cruiser joined the Grand Fleet in the North Sea, where she remained for the remainder of the war. &quot;Melbourne&quot; spent late 1919 and early 1920 in reserve, then was flagship of the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 until 1928, except for a second period in reserve during 1924 and 1925. HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; paid off in the United Kingdom on 23 April 1928, and was scrapped in 1929.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Melbourne&quot; was a Town class light cruiser. The ship had a standard displacement of 5,400 tons, was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , a maximum draught of , and a mean draught of . The propulsion machinery consisted of Yarrow boilers feeding Parsons steam turbines, which supplied 25,000 shaft horsepower to the ship&#x27;s four propellers. Although only designed to reach , &quot;Melbourne&quot; was capable of sailing at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 485: 31 officers, and 484 sailors.
The cruiser&#x27;s main armament consisted of eight BL Mk XI* 50 calibre guns. This was supplemented by a single QF 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, two .303-inch Maxim guns, and two 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (with seven torpedoes carried). A single QF 12-pounder 8 cwt gun field gun, four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns were also carried. Armour plating consisted of side belts thick amidships, tapering to thick at the bow and stern, along with protective decking over the engineering and magazine spaces, and an armoured conning tower.

The ship was laid down by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead in England on 4 April 1911. She was launched on 30 May 1912 by Mrs. F. F. Braund, daughter of Australian philanthropist Robert Barr Smith. Construction was completed on 18 January 1913, the same day &quot;Melbourne&quot; was commissioned into the RAN. She was the first cruiser launched for the RAN, and the first completed. The ship cost 405,000 pounds to build.

==Operational history==
On completion, &quot;Melbourne&quot; sailed from Portsmouth for Australia, arriving in Fremantle on 10 March 1913. Until August 1914, the cruiser was primarily involved in training cruises and port visits around Australia. During August and September, the cruiser operated with other Australian warships in the Pacific as a counter to the German East Asia Squadron, and was involved in the capture of several German colonies. &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Sydney on 20 September, and on 1 November joined the escort of the convoy transporting the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to Egypt. The cruiser left the convoy while in the Indian Ocean, and headed for Gibraltar, where she was then instructed to head for the Azores in search of the German cruiser SMS &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;.

By the time she reached the Azores on 12 December, &quot;Melbourne&quot; had been reassigned to Bermuda as part of the North America and West Indies Station. While on the Station, the cruiser patrolled the western Atlantic from Canada to Brazil. In August 1916, she sailed for Devonport in England, where she spent a month before joining the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the British Grand Fleet, stationed at Scapa Flow. From January until June 1917, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was docked at Birkenhead for major repairs to her propulsion system. The cruiser was fitted with an aeroplane platform in November 1917. On 1 June 1918, &quot;Melbourne&quot; launched her aircraft after sighting German aircraft over Heligoland Bight, but the pilot lost his target in the clouds. At the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was assigned to escort . The cruiser remained with the Grand Fleet until 30 November 1918: during the entire war, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was not involved in any sea battles. Initially, the cruiser was not awarded any battle honours, but a reorganisation of the RAN honours system published in 2010 retroactively awarded the honours &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot; and &quot;North Sea 1916–18&quot; to the ship.
&quot;Melbourne&quot; stayed in Portsmouth until 7 March 1919, then sailed for Sydney via Suez, Singapore, and Darwin. The ship was paid off into reserve on 5 August 1919 until 14 April 1920, when she was recommissioned. In 1922, the ship rescued personnel from the sailing vessel &quot;Helen B. Sterling&quot;, which had been disabled in the Tasman Sea by a gale. Also in 1922, the ship was assigned as Flagship of the Australian Squadron. She was returned to reserve on 29 September 1924; most of the four years in service had been spent in Australian waters, with cruises to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The cruiser was recommissioned on 8 October 1925, and left Sydney for England on 23 November. During 1926, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet on exchange, with the British cruiser sent to operate with the RAN. &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned in August 1926, and resumed duties as Flagship.

==Fate==

On 9 February 1928, &quot;Melbourne&quot; commenced her last voyage to England, where she arrived on 12 April. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was decommissioned for the final time on 23 April, with her ship&#x27;s company assigned to the new heavy cruiser . The ship was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company on 8 December for 25,000 pounds. The cruiser was transported to Birkenhead, and was broken up over the course of 1929.

<doc id="1175960" wikidata="Q7374101" url="?curid=1175960" title="Royal Deeside Railway">
<text>The Royal Deeside Railway is a Scottish heritage railway located at Milton of Crathes railway station on a part of the original Deeside Railway.

==Original railway==

Originally constructed between 1853 and 1866, the Deeside Railway ran between Ballater railway station and Aberdeen Ferryhill railway station. The line was regularly used by the Royal Family and other important people visiting Balmoral Castle. The line closed in stages between 1966 and 1967.

The line was one of those closed by the Beeching Report.

==Preservation history==
The Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society was formed in 1996 with the intention of restoring the section of the Deeside Railway which ran between Banchory and Milton of Crathes. The society began restoration work in 2003. The society operated a one-mile section of track starting in 2007. The first steam-hauled passenger service operated in 2010. In 2020, the railway opened a new station at Birkenbaud lay-by.

After a platform was built at Milton of Crathes railway station, a station building was donated from the closed Oldmeldrum Railway and moved to Milton of Crathes, where it serves as the Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society headquarters. Most of the track the railway owns is old track from Guild Street yard next to Aberdeen station. While some of the wooden and concrete sleepers are no longer safe to use, solutions are being explored to see if the concrete sleepers can be repaired and reused.

In 2020, the railway experienced financial trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

==Current operations==
The railway currently operates a passenger service over 1 mile of track from Milton of Crathes to Birkenbaud Crossing. All services call and terminate at Milton of Crathes with each journey taking 15–20 minutes for a return trip. Milton of Crathes station consists of a single platform and two tracks (which form a locomotive run-round loop and headshunts), a small shop, museum and a ticket office. A car park is available with disabled access.

The railway owns the original British Rail BEMU which was converted from a diesel engine to battery power and operated on the Deeside Railway from 1958 to 1966. The BEMU currently requires a complete electrical overhaul, but it is sometimes used as a passenger coach, offering an alternative to the Mark 2 coaches.

This rail services are operated using rolling stock including former Aberdeen Gas Works Steam Engine &quot;Bon Accord&quot; and British Rail Class 03 diesel shunters that haul three British Rail Mark 2 passenger coaches in BR Crimson and Cream livery, with a fourth coach currently being restored.

==Future==
The railway will soon extend to a new station, Riverside Halt. This station will allow passengers to disembark the train and walk the mile back to the Milton of Crathes or continue further along the Deeside Way towards Banchory. This new station will form the end of the running line, creating a passenger service between the Milton of Crathes and Riverside Halt via Birkenbaud Crossing. A new loop line is under construction at Riverside Halt, along with two new buffer end siding spaces. These new siding spaces will hold rolling stock which is currently not in use.

In 2020, it was announced that the group intends to extend the operating segment to Banchory railway station by using former track bed which is currently part of the Deeside Way.

A major challenge for future plans for the railway&#x27;s extension towards Banchory was the original 19th-century railway bridge known as the Bridge of Bennie which now carries the Deeside Way cycle and footpath after closure of the old line. The Deeside Railway wished to reuse the original railway bridge, however in order to do so, the Bridge of Bennie required strengthening for new railway traffic to cross. By using the original Bridge of Bennie, a new purpose built bridge would be required in order to continue the Deeside Way. The new Deeside Way bridge was lifted into place on the 15th December 2020, but delays due to COVID 19 restrictions and other difficulties have meant the new bridge remains closed to the public. This means that the Deeside way continues to use the Bridge of Bennie, meaning railway operations cannot be extended. It has been estimated that the extension to Banchory will cost approximately £250,000 once ongoing work is complete.

<text>Buisson is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It is named after the French physicist Henri Buisson. Nearly attached to the southeast rim is the crater Vesalius. To the southwest is Einthoven. The rim of this crater is somewhat worn, and is lowest in the north. There is a low central ridge across the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Buisson.

<text>Phorusrhacids, colloquially known as terror birds, are an extinct family of large carnivorous, mostly flightless birds that were among the largest apex predators in South America during the Cenozoic era. Their definitive fossil records range from the Middle Eocene to the Late Pleistocene around , though some specimens suggest that they were present since the Early Eocene.

They ranged in height from . One of the largest specimens from the Early Pleistocene of Uruguay, possibly belonging to &quot;Devincenzia&quot;, would have weighed up to . Their closest modern-day relatives are believed to be the seriemas. &quot;Titanis walleri&quot;, one of the larger species, is known from Texas and Florida in North America. This makes the phorusrhacids the only known large South American predator to migrate north in the Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama land bridge (the main pulse of the interchange began about 2.6 Ma ago; &quot;Titanis&quot; at 5 Ma was an early northward migrant).

It was once believed that &quot;T. walleri&quot; became extinct in North America around the time of the arrival of humans, but subsequent datings of &quot;Titanis&quot; fossils provided no evidence for their survival after 1.8 Ma. However, reports from Uruguay of new findings of phorusrachids such as a specimen of &quot;Psilopterus&quot; dating to 96,040 ± 6,300 years ago would imply that phorusrhacids survived in South America until the late Pleistocene.

Phorusrhacids may have even made their way into Africa and Europe, if the genus &quot;Lavocatavis&quot; from Algeria and &quot;Eleutherornis&quot; from France and Switzerland are included. However, the taxonomic placement of both taxa within phorusrhacids are considered highly questionable, and their remains are too fragmentary to be included in phylogenetic analyses. Possible specimens have also been discovered from the La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, Antarctica, suggesting that this group had a wider geographical range in the Paleogene.

The closely related bathornithids occupied a similar ecological niche in North America across the Eocene to Early Miocene; some, like &quot;Paracrax&quot;, were similar in size to the largest phorusrhacids. At least one analysis recovers &quot;Bathornis&quot; as sister taxa to phorusrhacids, on the basis of shared features in the jaws and coracoid, though this has been seriously contested, as these might have evolved independently for the same carnivorous, flightless lifestyle.

== Description ==

The neck can be divided into three main regions. In the higher regions of the neck, the phorusrhacid has bifurcate neural spines (BNS), while it has high neural spines in its lower regions. This suggests that the phorusrhacid had a highly flexible and developed neck allowing it to carry its heavy head and strike with terrifying speed and power. Although the phorusrhacid externally looks like it has a short neck, its flexible skeletal neck structure proves that it could expand farther beyond the expected reach and intimidate its prey using its height, allowing it to strike more easily. Once stretched out into its full length in preparation for a downward strike, its developed neck muscles and heavy head could produce enough momentum and power to cause fatal damage to the terror bird&#x27;s prey.

&quot;Kelenken guillermoi&quot;, from the Langhian stage of the Miocene epoch, some 15 million years ago, discovered in the Collón Curá Formation in Patagonia in 2006, represents the largest bird skull yet found. The fossil has been described as being a , nearly intact skull. The beak is roughly long and curves in a hook shape that resembles an eagle&#x27;s beak. Most species described as phorusrhacid birds were smaller, tall, but the new fossil belongs to a bird that probably stood about tall. Scientists theorize that the large terror birds were extremely nimble and quick runners, able to reach speeds of . Examination of phorusrhacid habitats also indicates that phorusrhacids may have presented intense competition to predatory metatherian sparassodonts such as borhyaenids and thylacosmilids, causing the mammalian predators to choose forested habitats to avoid the more successful and aggressive avian predators on the open plains.

The feet of the phorusrhacids had four toes, the first of which, known as the hallux, was reduced and did not touch the ground, while the others, corresponding to the second, third and fourth toes, were kept on the ground. Analysis of the resistance of the toes based on biomechanical models of curved beams, in particular of the second toe and its nail claw, indicate that it was modified into a &quot;sickle claw&quot; and was relatively uniform in various species and said claw would be relatively curved and large, which implies the need to keep it elevated to avoid wear or breakage due to contact with the ground, which would be achieved with a well-developed extensor tubercle and soft tissue pads on the fingers. The second toe, which was shorter and had fewer phalanges, also had more resistance and would make it easier to hold the claw off the ground and retain prey, a compromise with its predatory function and movement on the run, as occurs with modern seriemas, although to a lesser degree of specialization than dromaeosaurid dinosaurs. This is further supported by footprints from the Late Miocene of the Río Negro Formation, showcasing a trackway made by a mid-to-large sized terror bird with functionally didactyl footprints, the inner toe with the sickle claw raised mostly off the ground akin to their Mesozoic counterparts.

=== Skull structure ===

In the past, these birds were thought to have high beaks, round orbits, and vaulted braincases though there was never enough empirical evidence to support this. However, new fossils have been discovered in Comallo, Argentina. These skulls reveal that the terror bird has a triangular dorsal view, a rostrum that is hooked and more than half the length of the actual skull, and a more compact caudal portion. The external nares and antorbital fenestras (areas found in the nose) were found to be more square than triangular. These all contribute to a skull that is more rectangular in view rather than triangular. The structure of the fossils also suggest that these birds may have been swifter than originally thought.

A skull from a smaller subspecies of this bird was also found recently. With this fossil, it was found that the internal structure of the beak is hollow and reinforced with thin-walled trabeculae. There is also an absence of both zona flexoria palatina and zona flexoria arcus jugalis, which are key features that relate to the evolution of cranial akinesis. The discovery of this skull allows for the establishment of primary osteological homologies, which are useful in comparative anatomy, functional morphology, and phylogenetic studies.

== Palaeobiology ==

Most phorusrhacids were very fast runners. All members possessed a large, sharp beak, a powerful neck and sharp talons. However, even with these attributes, the phorusrhacids are often assumed to have preyed on relatively small animals (about the size of a rabbit) that could be dispatched with a minimum of struggle. This is because with the phorusrhacids&#x27; beak proportions, the jaw could not generate a great deal of bite force with which to kill the prey. This is disputable as many big-game hunting predators such as &quot;Smilodon&quot;, great white sharks and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; have weaker bite forces and often laterally weak skulls as adaptations towards, not away from, killing large prey, relying instead on the presence of a cutting edge, a wide gape made possible by the reduction of jaw musculature, and the driving force of the body or neck. Since phorusrhacids share many of the same adaptations, such as a large, laterally flattened skull with a sharp-edged beak and powerful neck musculature, it is possible that they were specialized predators of relatively large prey.

The bones of the beak were tightly fused together, making the beak more resilient to force from the front to back direction, thus suggesting that it could cause a great amount of harm through pecking as opposed to side-to-side head movements like shaking prey. Generally speaking, it is thought that a terror bird would use its feet to injure prey by kicking it, and to hold the prey down and dispatch by pecking at it with its large beak. Larger prey may also have been attacked by pecking and kicking, or by using the beak as a blade to strike at or slash vital organs.
It has been recently shown that at least some phorusrhacids like &quot;Andalgalornis&quot;, while very fast runners in a straight line, were poor at tight turns at speed, which contradicts the idea of phorusrhacids being agile predators of small prey.

=== Diet ===
All phorusrhacids are thought to have been carnivorous. The strong downwards curve from the tip of this beak suggests that it ripped the flesh from the body of other animals; many extant bird species with this feature are carnivorous. CT scans performed on the skull of a phorusrhacid reveal that the species would not have been able to shake its prey side to side, but rather exert significant downward force. Florentino Ameghino claimed in a letter to Édouard Trouessart that he had specimens from Argentina of &quot;petrified masses preserving skeletons of large rodents, Interatheriidae [small notoungulates] and even Proterotheriidae [deer-sized litopterns], with all their bones crushed and corroded, piled on with no apparent order and forming a nearly spherical mass with the skull in the center&quot; that resembled giant owl pellets, suggesting that phorusrhacids may have swallowed their prey whole and regurgitated the indigestible parts similar to owls. However, Ameghino never formally described these specimens and they have not yet been relocated, making it difficult to determine if they are phorusrhacid pellets. Fossilized pellets from northwestern Argentina have also been suggested to pertain to small phorusrhacids like &quot;Procariama&quot;.

== Classification ==
The etymology of the name Phorusrhacidae is based on the type genus &quot;Phorusrhacos&quot;. When first described by Florentino Ameghino in 1887, the etymology of &quot;Phorusrhacos&quot; was not given. Current thinking is that the name is derived from a combination of the Greek words &quot;phoros&quot;, which means &quot;bearer&quot; or &quot;bearing&quot;, and &quot;rhakos&quot;, which translates to &quot;wrinkles&quot;, &quot;scars&quot; or &quot;rents&quot;. Researchers have compared Phorusrhacidae with the living families of Cariamidae and Sagittariidae, but their differences in body mass are too drastic and, thus, one cannot overly depend on these living families for answers.

During the early Cenozoic, after the extinction of the non-bird dinosaurs, mammals underwent an evolutionary diversification, and some bird groups around the world developed a tendency towards gigantism; this included the Gastornithidae, the Dromornithidae, the Palaeognathae, and the Phorusrhacidae. Phorusrhacids are an extinct group within Cariamiformes, the only living members of which are the two species of seriemas in the family Cariamidae. While they are the most taxon-rich group within Cariamiformes, the interrelationships between phorusrhacids are unclear due to the incompleteness of their remains. A lineage of related predatory birds, the bathornithids, occupied North America prior to the arrival of phorusrhacids, living from the Eocene to Miocene and filled a similar niche to phorusrhacids. Only one genus belongs in the family, &quot;Bathornis&quot;, according to a 2016 analysis by paleontologist Gerald Mayr, who noted that &quot;Bathornis&quot; was more lightly built, with longer limbs proportionally and skulls more akin to those of &quot;Cariama&quot;.

Phylogenetic analysis of Cariamiformes and their relatives according to Mayr (2016) in his redescription of &quot;Bathornis&quot;: A 2024 study finds &quot;Bathornis&quot; as closer to seriemas than phorusrhacids were.

Following the revision by Alvarenga and Höfling (2003), there are now 5 subfamilies, containing 14 genera and 18 species: These species were the product of adaptive radiation. The following classification is based on LaBarge, Garderner &amp; Organ (2024), and taxa identified as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; were all excluded from phylogenetic analysis in their study (except for &quot;Brontornis&quot;):

Family Phorusrhacidae

Alvarenga and Höfling did not include the Ameghinornithidae from Europe in the phorusrhacoids; these have meanwhile turned out to be more basal members of Cariamae. Though traditionally considered as members of the Gruiformes, based on both morphological and genetic studies (the latter being based on the seriema) Cariamiformes may belong to a separate group of birds, Australaves, and their closest living relatives, according to nuclear sequence studies, are a clade consisting of Falconidae, Psittaciformes and Passeriformes.

The following cladogram follows the analysis of Degrange and colleagues, 2015:

== Extinction ==

During the Miocene and early Pliocene epochs, there was an increase in the phorusrhacid population size in South America, suggesting that, in that time frame, the various species flourished as predators in the savanna environment.

With the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama 2.7 million years ago, carnivorous dogs, bears, and cats from North America were able to cross into South America, increasing competition. (They had been preceded by procyonids as early as 7.3 million years ago.) The population of phorusrhacids declined thereafter according to older hypotheses, suggesting that competition with newly arrived predators was a major contributor to their extinction. Similar ideas have been considered for sparassodonts and for South America&#x27;s terrestrial sebecid crocodilians.

However, the role of competitive displacement in South American predator lineages has been questioned by some researchers. The timing of turnover events and the decline of South American predators do not correlate well with the arrival of large carnivores like canids or sabretooths (although they do correlate well with the earlier-arriving procyonids, which evolved to large body size in South America, but these were omnivorous), with native South American predator lineages (including most phorusrhacids and all sparassodonts and sebecids) dying out well before the arrival of most larger placental carnivores. Bathornithids, which were similar in ecology and are likely close relatives of phorusrhacids, existed entirely within North America during part of the Cenozoic and competed successfully for a time with large carnivorans such as nimravids, before becoming extinct in the Early Miocene, about 20 million years ago. The phorusrhacid &quot;Titanis&quot; expanded northward into southern North America during the Interchange and coexisted for several million years with large canids and big cats like &quot;Xenosmilus&quot;, before its extinction about 1.8 million years ago.

There were some suggestions that phorusrhacids, like the majority of Pleistocene megafauna, were killed off by human activity such as hunting or habitat change. This idea is no longer considered valid, as improved dating on &quot;Titanis&quot; specimens show that the last phorusrhacids went extinct over one million years before humans arrived. However, several fossil finds of smaller forms have been described from the late Pleistocene of Uruguay in South America. &quot;Psilopterus&quot; may have been present until 96,040 ± 6,300 years ago (maximum age obtained from the bottom of the fossil-containing stratum), which would extend the existence of the smaller members of this group of avian predators considerably. Another unidentified smaller type which may be a possible psilopterine from the La Paz Local Fauna of Uruguay has also been dated to the late Pleistocene, perhaps 17,620 ± 100 years ago based on radiocarbon analysis using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for the molar enamel samples of a proboscidean from the same site, but the validity of this previous radiocarbon dating has been considered highly questionable due to the enamel&#x27;s lack of collagen; the tibia of &quot;Macrauchenia patachonica&quot; from the same site has been more precisely dated to a mean value of approximately 21,600 ± 1,000 years ago based on gamma spectrometry and radiocarbon dating.

<doc id="1175987" wikidata="Q339619" url="?curid=1175987" title="List of Nobel laureates">
<text>The Nobel Prizes (, ) are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institutet, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. An additional prize in memory of Alfred Nobel was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden&#x27;s central bank) for outstanding contributions to the field of economics. Each recipient, a Nobelist or &quot;laureate&quot;, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation.

== Prize ==
Different organisations are responsible for awarding the individual prizes; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics; the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature; the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, equivalent to SEK in . In 2017, the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9 million SEK. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel&#x27;s death.

In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize. The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.

== Laureates ==
Between 1901 and 2017, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 892 individuals (including 844 men, 48 women) and 24 organizations. Six Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade four Germans, Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939) and Carl von Ossietzky (Peace, 1936) from accepting their Nobel Prizes. The Chinese government forbade Liu Xiaobo from accepting his Nobel Prize (Peace, 2010) and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. Liu Xiaobo, Carl von Ossietzky and Aung San Suu Kyi were all awarded their Nobel Prize while in prison or detention. Two Nobel laureates, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964) and Lê Ðức Thọ (Peace, 1973), declined the award; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors, and Thọ declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time.

Seven laureates have received more than one prize; of the seven, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more than any other. UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice, as was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless. Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field: Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry) and Linus Pauling (Chemistry and Peace). Among the 892 Nobel laureates, 48 have been women; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. She was also the first person (male or female) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes, the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, given in 1911.

== List of laureates ==


== 50-year secrecy rule ==
The Committee neither informs the media nor the candidates themselves of the names of the nominees. Insofar as specific names frequently appear in the early predictions of who will receive the award in any given year, this is either pure speculation or inside information from the person or people who submitted the nomination. After fifty years, the database of nominations maintained by the Nobel Committee is made available to the public. Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, states:A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made.

<text>Martyn Jerel Buchwald (January 30, 1942 – September 27, 2018), known as Marty Balin (), was an American singer, songwriter, and musician best known as a member of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship.

==Early life==
Balin was born Martyn Jerel Buchwald in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Catherine Eugenia &quot;Jean&quot; (née Talbot) and Joseph Buchwald. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Eastern Europe. His father was Jewish and his mother was Episcopalian. Buchwald attended Washington High School in San Francisco, California. As a child, Balin was diagnosed with autism.

==Career==
===Early musical work===
In 1962, Buchwald changed his name to Marty Balin, and began recording with Challenge Records in Los Angeles, releasing the singles &quot;Nobody but You&quot; and &quot;I Specialize in Love&quot;. By 1964, Balin was leading a folk music quartet named The Town Criers.

===Jefferson Airplane===
Balin was the primary founder of Jefferson Airplane, which he &quot;launched&quot; from a restaurant-turned-club he created and named The Matrix, and was also one of its lead vocalists and songwriters from 1965 to 1971. Balin was one of four Jewish members of the band, including bass player Jack Casady, drummer Spencer Dryden and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. In the group&#x27;s 1966–1971 iteration, Balin served as co-lead vocalist alongside Grace Slick. Balin&#x27;s songwriting output diminished after &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; (1967) as Slick, Paul Kantner, and Kaukonen matured as songwriters, a process compounded by personality clashes. Balin&#x27;s most enduring songwriting contributions were often imbued with a romantic, pop-oriented lilt that was atypical of the band&#x27;s characteristic forays into psychedelic rock. Among Balin&#x27;s most notable songs were &quot;Comin&#x27; Back to Me&quot; (a folk rock ballad later covered by Ritchie Havens and Rickie Lee Jones), &quot;Today&quot; (a collaboration with Kantner initially written on spec for Tony Bennett that was prominently covered by Tom Scott), and, again with Kantner, the topical 1969 top-100 hit &quot;Volunteers&quot;. Although uncharacteristic of his oeuvre, the uptempo &quot;3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds&quot; and &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; (both written for &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;) remained integral components of the Airplane&#x27;s live set throughout the late 1960s.

Balin played with Jefferson Airplane at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and at the Woodstock Festival in 1969.

In December 1969, Balin was knocked unconscious by members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club while performing during the infamous Altamont Free Concert, as seen in the 1970 documentary film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. In April 1971, he formally departed Jefferson Airplane after breaking off all communication with his bandmates following the completion of their autumn 1970 American tour. He elaborated upon this decision in a 1993 interview with Jeff Tamarkin of &quot;Relix:&quot;

Balin remained active in the San Francisco Bay Area rock scene, managing and producing an album for the Berkeley-based sextet Grootna before briefly joining funk-inflected hard rock ensemble Bodacious DF as lead vocalist on their eponymous 1973 debut album. The following year, Kantner asked Balin to write a song for his new Airplane offshoot group, Jefferson Starship. Together, they wrote the early power ballad &quot;Caroline&quot;, which appeared on the album &quot;Dragon Fly&quot; with Balin as guest lead vocalist.

===Jefferson Starship===
Rejoining the team he had helped to establish, Balin became a permanent member of Jefferson Starship in 1975; over the next three years, he contributed to and sang lead on four top-20 hits, including &quot;Miracles&quot; (No. 3, a Balin original), &quot;With Your Love&quot; (No. 12, a collaboration between Balin, former Jefferson Airplane drummer Joey Covington, and former Grootna/Bodacious DF lead guitarist Vic Smith), Jesse Barish&#x27;s &quot;Count on Me&quot; (No. 8), and N. Q. Dewey&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot; (No. 12). Ultimately, Balin&#x27;s relationship with the band was beleaguered by interpersonal problems and his own reluctance toward live performances. He abruptly left the group in October 1978 shortly after Slick&#x27;s departure from the band.

===Solo work, and reunion projects===
In 1979, Balin produced a rock opera titled &quot;Rock Justice&quot;, about a rock star who was put in jail for failing to produce a hit for his record company, based on his experiences with the lawsuits fought for years with former Jefferson Airplane manager Matthew Katz. The cast recording was produced by Balin, but it did not feature him in performance.
Balin continued with EMI as a solo artist and in 1981, he released his first solo album, &quot;Balin&quot;, featuring two Jesse Barish songs that became top-40 hits, &quot;Hearts&quot; (#8) and &quot;Atlanta Lady (Something About Your Love)&quot; (#27). In 1983, Balin released a second solo album, &quot;Lucky&quot;, along with a Japan-only EP produced by EMI called &quot;There&#x27;s No Shoulder&quot;. Balin&#x27;s contract with EMI ended shortly thereafter.

In 1985, he teamed with former Jefferson Airplane members Paul Kantner and Jack Casady to form the KBC Band. After the breakup of the KBC band, a 1989 reunion album and tour with Jefferson Airplane followed.

Balin continued recording solo albums in the years following the reunion, and reunited with Kantner in the latest incarnation of Jefferson Starship.

Balin had intended to record lead vocals for two tracks for Jefferson Starship&#x27;s album &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Tree of Liberty&quot;. However, his art touring schedule conflicted with studio sessions, and instead, the track &quot;Maybe for You&quot;, from the German release of &quot;Windows of Heaven&quot;, was included.

On July 2, 2007, the music-publishing firm Bicycle Music, Inc. announced that it had acquired an interest in songs written or performed by Balin, including hits from his days with Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship.

==Honors==
Balin, along with the other members of the 1966–1970 line-up of Jefferson Airplane, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. As a member of Jefferson Airplane, he was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.

==Personal life==
Balin enjoyed painting all his life. He painted many of the most influential musicians of the last half of the 20th century. Marty Balin&#x27;s Atelier was located at 130 King Fine Art in Saint Augustine, Florida, Balin&#x27;s permanent signature collection gallery.

Balin resided in Florida and San Francisco with his wife, Susan Joy Balin, formerly Susan Joy Finkelstein. Balin and Finkelstein had two daughters; Susan had previously had two other daughters.

Balin married Karen Deal in 1989. Karen died in 2010.

==Health and death==
While on tour in March 2016, Balin was taken to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York City after complaining of chest pains. After undergoing open-heart surgery, he was transferred to an intensive-care unit to spend time recovering. In a subsequent lawsuit, Balin alleged that neglect and inadequate care facilities on the hospital&#x27;s part had resulted in a paralyzed vocal cord, loss of his left thumb and half of his tongue, bedsores, and kidney damage.

Balin died at his home in Tampa on September 27, 2018, at the age of 76.

<text>Alonso de Mercado y Villacorta, Marquis of Villacorta was a Spanish civil servant, acting in the Río de la Plata area of the Viceroyalty of Peru.

Born in Catalonia, he was Governor of Tucumán from 1655 to 1660. He was conned by Pedro Bohórquez, a Spanish adventurer who promised Mercado access to the hidden location of Inca treasures and afterwards had to suppress a revolt of Indians led by Bohórquez.

Afterwards, he was nominated as Governor of the Río de la Plata, a position that he held between 1660 and 1663. He ordered the transfer of the city of Santa Fe to its present location. In 1662, he expelled the Society of Jesus from its initial location on the Plaza de Mayo, as its buildings interfered with shooting practices of nearby Buenos Aires&#x27; &quot;fortress&quot; (the current Casa Rosada).

His request for royal authorization to commerce with two foreign ships a year was denied. Nonetheless, he allowed Dutch ships to dock in the Buenos Aires port. Because of his tolerance for the contraband of goods and slaves, he was subjected to a tribunal of grievances, but the case was dismissed. He was demoted and again became Governor of Tucumán (1664–1670). He founded San José de Metán (1665) and fortified the city of Talavera de Esteco to prevent further attacks from the Indians. He conducted a final campaign against Calchaquí Indians, and ordered the exile of 200 families of Quilmes Indians to Buenos Aires.

<text>Bryan Clifford Sykes (9 September 1947 – 10 December 2020) was a British geneticist and science writer who was a Fellow of Wolfson College and Emeritus Professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford.

Sykes published the first report on retrieving DNA from ancient bone (&quot;Nature&quot;, 1989). He was involved in a number of high-profile cases dealing with ancient DNA, including that of Ötzi the Iceman. He also suggested a Florida accountant by the name of Tom Robinson was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, a claim that was subsequently disproved.

Sykes is best known outside the community of geneticists for his two popular books on the investigation of human history and prehistory through studies of mitochondrial DNA.

== Education ==

Sykes was educated at Eltham College, received his BSc from the University of Liverpool, his PhD from the University of Bristol, and his DSc from the University of Oxford.

==Career==
=== &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot; ===
In 2001 (Banta Press Hardback) Sykes published a book for the popular audience, &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot;, in which he explained how the dynamics of maternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance leave their mark on the human population in the form of genetic clans sharing common maternal descent. He notes that the majority of Europeans can be classified in seven such clans, known scientifically as haplogroups, distinguishable by differences in their mtDNA that are unique to each group, with each clan descending from a separate prehistoric female-line ancestor. He referred to these seven &#x27;clan mothers&#x27; as &#x27;daughters of Eve&#x27;, a reference to the mitochondrial Eve to whom the mtDNA of all modern humans traces. Based on the geographical and ethnological distribution of the modern descendants of each clan he assigned provisional homelands for the seven clan mothers, and used the degree to which each clan diverges to approximate the time period when the clan mother would have lived. He then uses these deductions to give &#x27;biographies&#x27; for each of the clan mothers, assigning them arbitrary names based on the scientific designation of their haplogroup (for example, using the name Xenia for the founder of haplogroup X).

=== &quot;Blood of the Isles&quot; ===
In his 2006 book &quot;Blood of the Isles&quot; (published in the United States and Canada as &quot;Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland&quot;), Sykes examines British genetic &quot;clans&quot;. He presents evidence from mitochondrial DNA, inherited by both sexes from their mothers, and the Y chromosome, inherited by men from their fathers, and makes the following claims:

* The genetic makeup of Britain and Ireland is overwhelmingly what it has been since the Neolithic period and to a very considerable extent since the Mesolithic period, especially in the female line, i.e. those people, who in time would become identified as British Celts (culturally speaking), but who (genetically speaking) should more properly be called Cro-Magnon. In continental Europe, this same Cro-Magnon genetic legacy gave rise to the Basques. &quot;Basque&quot; and &quot;Celt&quot; are cultural designations, not genetic ones.
* The contribution of the Celts of Central Europe to the genetic makeup of Britain and Ireland was minimal; most of the genetic contribution to the British Isles of those we think of as Celtic, came from western continental Europe, i.e. the Atlantic seaboard.
* The Picts were not a separate people: the genetic makeup of the formerly Pictish areas of Scotland shows no significant differences from the general profile of the rest of Britain. The two &quot;Pictland&quot; regions are Tayside and Grampian.
* The Anglo-Saxons are supposed, by some, to have made a substantial contribution to the genetic makeup of England, but in Sykes&#x27;s opinion it was under 20 percent of the total, even in Southern England.
* The Vikings (Danes and Norwegians) also made a substantial contribution, which is concentrated in central, northern and eastern England – the territories of the ancient Danelaw. There is a very heavy Viking contribution in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, in the vicinity of 40 percent. Women as well as men contributed substantially in all these areas, showing that the Vikings engaged in large-scale settlement.
* The Norman contribution was extremely small, on the order of 2 percent.
* There are only sparse traces of the Roman occupation, almost all in Southern England.
* In spite of all these later contributions, the genetic makeup of the British Isles remains overwhelmingly what it was in the Neolithic: a mixture of the first Mesolithic inhabitants with Neolithic settlers who came by sea from Iberia and ultimately from the eastern Mediterranean.
* There is a difference between the genetic histories of men and women in Britain and Ireland. The matrilineages show a mixture of original Mesolithic inhabitants and later Neolithic arrivals from Iberia, whereas the patrilineages are much more strongly correlated with Iberia.
* There is evidence for a &quot;Genghis Khan effect&quot;, whereby some male lineages in ancient times were much more successful than others in leaving large numbers of descendants; e.g. Niall of the Nine Hostages in 4th and 5th century Ireland and Somerled in 12th century Scotland.

Sykes used a similar approach to that used in &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot; to identify the nine &quot;clan mothers&quot; of Japanese ancestry, &quot;all different from the seven European equivalents.&quot;

==== Modern evidence ====

With the advent of whole-genome sequencing and analysis of ancient DNA, many of Sykes&#x27; theories regarding the origins of the British have been largely invalidated. A 2018 study argues that over 90% of the DNA of the Neolithic population of Britain was overturned by a North European Bell Beaker population, originating from the Pontic Steppes, as part of an ongoing migration process that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to North and West Europe. Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, rather than Iberians, Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France. Similar studies have concluded that the Anglo-Saxons, while not replacing the previous populations outright, may have contributed more to the gene pool in much of England than Sykes had claimed.

=== Alleged hominid samples ===
Sykes and his team at Oxford University carried out DNA analysis of presumed Yeti samples and thinks the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. Sykes told BBC News:

He conducted another similar survey in 2014, this time examining samples attributed not just to yeti but also to Bigfoot and other &quot;anomalous primates.&quot; The study concluded that two of the 30 samples tested most closely resembled the genome of a palaeolithic polar bear, and that the other 28 were from living mammals.

The samples were subsequently re-analysed by Ceiridwen Edwards and Ross Barnett. They concluded that the mutation that had led to the match with a polar bear was a damaged artefact, and suggested that the two hair samples were in fact from Himalayan brown bears (&quot;U. arctos isabellinus&quot;). These bears are known in Nepal as Dzu-the (a Nepalese term meaning cattle-bear), and have been associated with the myth of the yeti. Sykes and Melton acknowledged that their GenBank search was in error but suggested that the hairs were instead a match to a modern polar bear specimen &quot;from the Diomede Islands in the Bering Sea reported in the same paper&quot;. They maintained that they did not see any sign of damage in their sequences and commented that they had &quot;no reason to doubt the accuracy of these two sequences any more than the other 28 presented in the paper&quot;. Multiple further analyses, including replication of the single analysis conducted by Sykes and his team, were carried out in a study conducted by Eliécer E. Gutiérrez, a researcher at the Smithsonian Institution and Ronald H. Pine, affiliated at the University of Kansas. All of these analyses found that the relevant genetic variation in brown bears makes it impossible to assign, with certainty, the Himalayan samples to either that species or to the polar bear. Because brown bears occur in the Himalayas, Gutiérrez and Pine stated that there is no reason to believe that the samples in question came from anything other than ordinary Himalayan brown bears.

==Personal life==
Sykes married Sue Foden, whom he met as a student in Oxford. They were married from 1978 to 1984, but remained close, and their son Richard was born in 1991. Sykes was a keen croquet player, representing Ireland in the 1984 Home Internationals. Sykes died in December 2020.

<doc id="1176000" wikidata="Q2929043" url="?curid=1176000" title="Buys-Ballot (crater)">
<text>Buys-Ballot is an oddly-shaped lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. The crater was named by the IAU in 1970.

This formation has a distinctive shape for a crater, having a prominent extension to the south that nearly doubles the dimension compared to the width across the maximum west–east cross-section. It vaguely resembles a pear, with the thinner end to the south and the bulge to the north. Despite the odd shape, this crater has not been significantly eroded and only a few tiny craterlets mark the interior or the rim.

Running down the middle of the crater along its longest dimension is a ridge that divides the southern part in half. This ridge extends as far north as the widest part before coming to an end. The floor at this widest part has been partially resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving an oval area around the northern edge of the central ridge surrounded by a patch of material with a lower albedo than the surroundings. The remainder of the interior floor is somewhat rough and irregular, particularly in the southern half.

Attached to the northern end of the crater is another odd formation consisting of the satellite craters Buys-Ballot Y and Z. These two nearly resemble mirror images of each other, being joined down the center by a narrow ridge line and extending nearly twice as far to the north as their individual widths in the east–west direction. The main difference between the two is that there is a concentric formation at the north end of the crater Y. The interior surfaces of both craters are irregular.

Buys-Ballot lies just to the northwest of the small lunar mare named Lacus Luxuriae, and southeast of the crater Freundlich. Other nearby craters of note are Anderson to the southwest and Dante to the northeast. The crater lies north of the center of the Freundlich-Sharonov Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Buys-Ballot.

<text>The Saturn Vehicle Evaluation Committee, better known as the Silverstein Committee, was a US government commission assembled in 1959 to recommend specific directions that NASA could take with the Saturn rocket program. The committee was chaired by Abe Silverstein, a long-time NASA engineer, with the express intent of selecting upper stages for the Saturn after a disagreement broke out between the Air Force and Army over its development. During the meetings the Committee members outlined a number of different potential designs, including the low-risk solution von Braun was developing with existing ICBM airframes, as well as versions using entirely new upper stages developed to take full advantage of the booster stage. The advantages of using new uppers were so great that the committee won over an initially skeptical von Braun, and the future of the Saturn program changed forever.

==Background==
In 1957 the Department of Defense (DoD) released a set of requirements for a new heavy-lift booster for missions starting in the early 1960s. At the time, all three branches of the US military were in the process of developing their own rockets, which led to considerable in-fighting between them on the priority of future developments. In 1956 the US Air Force won the concession that long range rocketry was its domain, including all ground-to-ground missiles over range. The agreement did not cover &quot;other roles&quot; however, and existing projects at the Navy and Army continued as before.

The Air Force was in the midst of their Dyna-Soar project, and were designing a new booster to launch it under their &quot;SLV-4&quot; requirement. Their primary answer to this requirement was a Titan II missile equipped with a new hydrogen-burning upper stage, the Titan C. The resulting design had a somewhat bulbous appearance; as the hydrogen fuel required large tanks, the upper stage was in diameter, compared to the of the Titan II. Other teams within the Air Force were also developing the Space Launcher System concept, which combined the same Titan II with a number of solid fuel rockets as a &quot;zeroth stage&quot;. By combining different numbers and sizes of these rockets, the launch stack could be tuned to different payloads. The SLS team also outlined a development path for a crewed lunar mission under their Lunex Project proposal, using the Titan with four solids to test the re-entry vehicle from Earth orbit, and entirely new solids and liquid stages for flights to the Moon.

To meet the same DoD requirement for a heavy space launcher, the Army team at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under the direction of a team led by Wernher von Braun studied a number of designs that clustered existing missile airframes and optionally added new engines. The design series included the &quot;Super-Titan&quot;, &quot;Super-Atlas&quot; and &quot;Super-Jupiter&quot;. The latter quickly became their focus, as it consisted of technology developed at ABMA, while the Atlas and Titan were Air Force designs suffering from extended development problems. The Super-Jupiter design was based almost entirely on existing equipment, using a cluster of Redstone and Jupiter missiles to form a lower stage powered by a new engine, with an upper stage adapted from the Titan. Their proposal was much simpler and lower-risk than the Air Force proposal, which required the development of a new hydrogen-burning upper stage. Like the Air Force team, ABMA also outlined their vision of a crewed lunar mission as Project Horizon, using fifteen of these rockets to build a large vehicle in Earth orbit.

The newly formed Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which was put in charge of development of the launcher, sided with the ABMA design. Their only concern was that the new engines might be a risk, suggesting that more moderate upgrades of existing engines be used instead. ABMA quickly adapted the design to use eight engines developed from the Jupiter&#x27;s S-3D as the H-1, as opposed to four of the proposed E-1 of the original design. ARPA was satisfied, and started funding development of both the booster at ABMA and the new H-1 engines at Rocketdyne. Contracts were tendered in October 1958 and work proceeded quickly; the first test-firing of the H-1 occurred in December and a mock-up of the booster had already been completed. Originally known as Super-Jupiter, the design became the Juno V during development, and on February 3 an ARPA memorandum officially renamed the project Saturn.

Soon after, the newly formed NASA also expressed their interest in the Saturn design as part of their long-term strategy. Launches in the early 1960s would focus on low-Earth orbit using existing ICBMs as launchers, technology development for the lunar program would be based on Saturn, and the actual direct ascent lunar mission would use the massive Nova rocket, then under design at NASA. Shortly thereafter, on 9 June 1959, Herbert York, Director of the Department of Defense Research and Engineering, announced that he had decided to terminate the Saturn program. York felt that the DoD should not be funding a booster whose only concrete role was to support a civilian space program. A meeting was arranged to &quot;save&quot; the program, which resulted in the Saturn program, and all of ABMA with it, being transferred to NASA.

== Members and Directive ==
At the request of the Associate Administrator of NASA in November of 1959, the Director of Space Flight Development formed an inter-agency study group composed of members of NASA, the Directorate of Defense Research and Engineering, ARPA, ABMA, and the Air Force. These members were Abe Silverstein (NASA) as Chairman, then Col. N. Appold (USAF), A. Hyatt (NASA), T. C. Muse (ODDR&amp;E), G. P. Sutton (ARPA), W. von Braun (ABMA), and E. Hall (NASA) as Secretary.

The request was for the group to formulate recommendations for the development of the Saturn rocket, specifically concerning selection of the upper stage configurations. The study was additionally tasked with focusing on four primary areas: determine the desired missions and payloads, identify potential problems with technical development, determine the cost and development time, and compare future growth in vehicle performance.

==Selecting an upper stage==

Nevertheless, the Air Force continued to agitate the development process. In December, ABMA, still part of the Army at this point, received an order to change the upper stage of the Saturn from the Titan-derived vehicle with a 120-inch diameter, to a new one with a 160-inch diameter that would require considerably more development. The 160-inch diameter stage was the same as the Titan C upper stage, and by making this change to the Saturn the DoD would have two competing upper stage designs for the SLV-4 requirement, as well as allowing Saturn to launch Dyna-Soar if the need arose. ABMA was already testing the engines for their Titan-derived upper stage, and was upset with this new request.

A meeting of all involved parties was arranged under the direction of Abe Silverstein, whose earlier efforts were instrumental in Saturn being selected for NASA missions. The group listed three missions for the initial Saturn vehicle: uncrewed lunar and deep space missions with an escape payload of about ; payloads to geostationary orbit; and crewed spacecraft missions of about in low orbits, such as Dyna-Soar.

To make such &quot;high altitude&quot; missions practical, the performance of the upper stages would be key. Every pound used in the stage or its fuel would mean that much less cargo, given any particular booster (first stage). Since it was the power-to-weight ratio that they needed, upper stages based on liquid hydrogen seemed to be the only way forward – the light weight of the fuel makes up for any difficulty handling it. The Saturn proposal had always included such a stage for orbital insertion, the Centaur, a hydrogen-burning stage derived from the Atlas ICBM.

For the intermediate stages the designers had somewhat more flexibility. The Committee members outlined a number of possible solutions grouped into three different classes: class &quot;A,&quot; class &quot;B,&quot; and class &quot;C.&quot; Common among all three classes, with the exception of the proposed C-3, was the new first stage consisting of a cluster of eight H-1 engines attached to the Jupiter/Redstone tank cluster, which would become the S-I stage, as well as the two engine Centaur upper stage. The class &quot;A&quot; designs were the low-risk solutions; von Braun&#x27;s current design became the A-1, consisting of a Titan I second stage between the S-I first stage and Centaur third stage. The A-2 replaced the second stage of the A-1 with a cluster of Thor IRBMs. Though the class &quot;A&quot; vehicles would have had the earliest flight availability due to the utilization of existing hardware, they failed to meet the first two mission for the Saturn rocket. Additionally, the 120-inch upper stages posed a potential structural weakness, and the proposed 160-inch upgrade would limit growth potential, violating fourth request of the original directive.

The single class &quot;B&quot; design considered by the committee, the B-1, consisted of a four-stage design with the aforementioned S-I first stage and Centaur fourth stage. The second stage would be an all-new 220-inch LOX/RP-1 design using four of the H-1 engines used by the first stage, along with a new four-engine third stage derived from Centaur but with a 220-inch diameter. Though the B-1 vehicle met the mission requirements, it would have been too costly and taken too much time to develop the new second stage. 

The class &quot;C&quot; designs used liquid hydrogen in all upper stages. C-1 would consist of the existing S-I booster, a new Douglas Aircraft 220-inch S-IV stage powered by four upgraded versions of the Centaur engines with to thrust per engine, and a modified Centaur using the same engines as a third stage. The C-1 would become the C-2 upon insertion of a new S-III stage with two new to thrust engines, keeping the S-IV and Centaur on top. The C-3 was a similar adaptation, inserting the S-II stage with four of the same 150-200,000 lbf thrust engines, keeping the S-III and S-IV stages of the C-2, but eliminating the Centaur. The first stage of the C-3 would also be increased to over by either replacing the four center H-1 engines with one F-1 engine, or uprating all eight H-1 engines.Examining the results strongly suggested that the C models were the only ones worth proceeding with, as they offered much higher performance than any other combination and offered great flexibility by allowing the stages to be mixed-and-matched for any particular launch need. Additionally, by developing the rocket in a building-block manner maximum vehicle reliability would be achieved as each new stage is added to already tested and proven stages.

Thus the decision came down not to performance, which was clearly settled, but development risk. The Saturn had always been designed to be as low-risk as possible, the only really new components being a minor upgrade to the engine for the lower stage and the Centaur as the upper stage. Developing entirely new hydrogen-burning stages for the entire &quot;stack&quot; would increase the risk that a failure of any one of the components could disrupt the entire program. But as the Committee members noted: &quot;If these propellants are to be accepted for the difficult top-stage applications, there seems to be no valid engineering reasons for not accepting the use of high-energy propellants for the less difficult application to intermediate stages.&quot; von Braun was won over; development of the current design would continue as a back-up, but the future of the Saturn was based on hydrogen and was tailored solely to NASA&#x27;s requirements.

On the last day of 1959, NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan approved the Silverstein recommendations. Chances of meeting the schedule improved with two Eisenhower administration decisions in January 1960. The Saturn project received a DX rating, which designated a program of highest national priority, which gave program managers privileged status in securing scarce materials. More important, the administration agreed to NASA&#x27;s request for additional funds. The Saturn FY 1961 budget was increased from $140 million to $230 million. On 15 March 1960 President Eisenhower officially announced the transfer of the Army&#x27;s Development Operations Division to NASA.

==Saturn emerges==

The Saturn C vehicles imagined in the Silverstein Committee report were never built. As soon as the Saturn became a NASA-tuned design of high performance, the DoD became less interested in it for their own needs. Development of the Titan continued for these roles, and as a result the flexibility offered by the variety of Saturn C-model intermediate stages simply wasn&#x27;t needed, and were eventually abandoned.

All that survived of the recommendation was the S-I first stage and the smallest of the new upper stages, the S-IV. It was originally intended that the S-IV would be equipped with four upgraded Centaur engines, but to decrease risk it was decided to use the existing engines and increase their number from four to six. A new, larger engine, the J-2, was already in the pipeline that could replace these. The original S-IV design, the 220-inch with six engines, was used only for a short period until a larger diameter 260-inch version was created for the Saturn Block II models, and then finally replaced with the J-2 powered S-IVB of the Saturn IB.

Until 1963 Saturns were classified by a C and an Arabic numeral. People generally assume that C stood for configuration; but according to Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Spaceport News (17 January 1963), MSFC engineers used it to designate vehicular &quot;concepts.&quot; Saturn C-1 denoted the concept of the S-1 booster topped with upper stages using liquid hydrogen as a propellant. C-2, C-3, and C-4 were drawing-board concepts that preceded the C-5 (Saturn V) Moon rocket. For additional information on the origins of Saturn, see John L. Sloop, &quot;Liquid Hydrogen as a Propulsion Fuel, 1945-1959, NASA SP-4404&quot;, in press, chap. 12.

<text>The Richmond RiverDogs were a minor professional ice hockey team based in Richmond, Virginia, that played at the Richmond Coliseum from 2003 to 2006.

The RiverDogs were formed during an expansion of the United Hockey League (UHL) in the fall of 2003, replacing the ECHL&#x27;s Richmond Renegades, which folded in April 2003. It was originally owned by Dr. Eric Margenau, a New York–based psychologist who also owned several other minor league teams. In their first year of play in the UHL, the RiverDogs were coached by Rod Langway and won the Eastern Division in the regular season and made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the Elmira Jackals. General manager Jeff Croop then fired Langway and replaced him with Don Martin. The following offseason, Dr. Margenau sold the team to Glenn Morelli and the team failed to qualify for the playoffs while also reportedly bouncing checks.

In 2005, Dr. Eric Margenau re-purchased the franchise along with Jay Acton and hired Robbie Nichols as head coach and general manager. On January 31, 2006, Nichols was announced to be leaving his post as coach of the RiverDogs on February 4 to join to the UHL expansion Chicago Hounds, which was also owned by Dr. Margenau, while staying on for the rest of the season as the RiverDogs&#x27; general manager. In April 2006, the Richmond Coliseum&#x27;s management announced that the RiverDogs had missed several opportunities to renew their lease for 2006–07 and Margenau transferred all operations to the new Chicago team.

The RiverDogs were replaced by the second incarnation of the Richmond Renegades in the Southern Professional Hockey League in October 2006. Former RiverDog Brian Goudie was named player–assistant coach of the SPHL Renegades in 2006–07 and head coach of the Renegades in 2007–08.

<doc id="1176009" wikidata="Q1126555" url="?curid=1176009" title="LDV Group">
<text>LDV Group Limited, formerly Leyland DAF Vans, was a British van manufacturer based in Washwood Heath, Birmingham. Historically part of Rover Group and Leyland DAF, it was later a wholly owned subsidiary of GAZ. Owing to the global recession and a lack of long-term investment, production was suspended at the LDV factory in December 2008.

After a series of failed rescue attempts, the intellectual property rights were sold by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers to Eco Concept in 2009, who sold them to SAIC Motor in 2010, with its Maxus subsidiary commencing production in China in March 2011.

==History==

LDV was formed in April 1993 as Leyland DAF Vans, following a management buyout backed by 3i of DAF NV&#x27;s van plant in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, following the Dutch company being placed in administration. It was rebranded as LDV in January 1994.

Prior to its merger with Leyland Trucks and DAF Trucks to form DAF NV (which in the UK traded as Leyland DAF) in February 1987, it was part of the British Leyland/Rover Group empire, and was latterly the Freight Rover arm of the Land Rover Group division.

In December 2005, after going into administration, LDV was bought by group Sun Capital Partners, and was subject to a financial restructuring. &quot;What Van?&quot; reported LDV&#x27;s commitment to its existing customers, including an assurance from their marketing director that their production target of 1,000 vans per month would put them well above break even point.

GAZ acquired LDV on 31 July 2006. Former Ford of Europe executive Martin Leach and former AT Kearney executive Steve Young were appointed to run the business and expand production at LDV&#x27;s Birmingham plant by adding new product lines and entering new markets in Europe and elsewhere.

GAZ had plans to export LDV technology to Russia, and start producing the Maxus at its plant in Nizhny Novgorod (Russia), with 50,000 as an initial volume. There were also proposals to export the GAZ Maxus to Australia, a traditional market for British Leyland.

However, GAZ&#x27;s plans never really showed any increased output, and due to the severe worldwide recession and a lack of long-term investment and commitment, production was suspended at the LDV factory in Birmingham in December 2008. After the British Government tried once again to save the company by agreeing to pour in £5 million of grants to enable Malaysia&#x27;s WestStar Corporation to purchase LDV. WestStar failed to secure financing.

The intellectual property rights were sold by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers to Chinese firm Eco Concept on 15 October 2009, who sold them to SAIC Motor in August 2010, with Maxus commencing production in China in March 2011.

Coincidentally, PWC were the same group of administrators who dealt with the demise of the MG Rover Group in 2005, the descendant of the original company Leyland Trucks was a part of. Also, SAIC Motor currently owns the rights to most of MG Rover&#x27;s assets, reuniting the two companies.

==Vehicles==
LDV produced a range of panel vans, pick ups and minibuses, all available with various modifications and specifications. LDV&#x27;s main customers were large British corporations, such as Royal Mail, National Grid plc and many other utility companies, which were politically persuaded to buy British built vehicles.

200/400 Series 
The plant produced what was known as the 200 and 400 Series vans, inside the plant these were known as the K2 and 210 respectively. After the factory went into receivership in 1993, and a management backed buyout headed by Allan Amey, the 200 and 400 were given a facelift on the existing chassis, and renamed Pilot and Convoy.

===Pilot/Convoy===
Until 2006, LDV produced the Pilot and Convoy, derived from the British Leyland Sherpa, and developed considerably throughout the 1970s to 1990s, and which were a common sight in the United Kingdom.

===Cub===
Between 1998 and 2001, LDV sold the Cub, which is a rebranded version of the Nissan Vanette Cargo after LDV entered into an agreement with Nissan. Production stopped in 2001 when Nissan replaced the Vanette Cargo with a rebranded version of the Renault Trafic called the Nissan Primastar, which is produced in Luton, England and Barcelona, Spain. LDV, having struggled to sell the Cub, opted not to continue the agreement with Nissan.

===Maxus===
The last range of vans, the Maxus, was introduced in the end of 2004. The Maxus was originally planned as a joint venture with Daewoo Motors of South Korea. Daewoo however, went into receivership in November 2000, before the project came to fruition.

LDV subsequently acquired the exclusive rights to the van from General Motors, who had taken over Daewoo, and purchased the existing tooling and shipped it all to the Washwood Heath factory in Birmingham from the Daewoo Plant in Poland where the van was originally intended to be built. The Maxus was fitted with direct injection, common rail, diesel engines supplied by VM Motori.

==Sponsorships==
LDV sponsored:
*Aston Villa Football Club from 1998 to 2000 
*St Mirren Football Club from 2000 to 2003 
*the EFL Trophy from 2000 to 2006

<text>Dream Park is a 1981 sci-fi/murder mystery novel by American writers Larry Niven and Steven Barnes, set in a futuristic amusement park of the same name. It was nominated for the 1982 Locus Award
and later expanded into a series of cyberpunk murder mysteries: &quot;The Barsoom Project&quot; (1989), &quot;The California Voodoo Game&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Moon Maze Game&quot; (2011). The books describe a futuristic form of live action role-playing games (LARPs), although the term was not in use when the original novel was published. The novels inspired many LARP groups, notably the International Fantasy Games Society which is named after a fictional entity in the book.

==Overview==
The &quot;Dream Park&quot; series is set in a near-future Earth, the first book taking place in March 2051. Technology is used to create realistic games in which participants act out the roles of free-willed protagonists in various stories. These are role-playing games and foreshadowed many aspects of modern live action role-playing games.

Many elements of the Dream Park games will be familiar to players of traditional pen-and-paper role playing games, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The novels are replete with references to dice rolls, character sheets, and experience points, although there&#x27;s no mention of anyone playing pen-and-paper (just video games). Most of the classic character classes (fighter, mage, thief, and cleric) are still in use, although &quot;engineer&quot; and &quot;scout&quot; are added in.

The most obvious difference between the games and modern LARP is one of budget and scale. Most Dream Park games use massive, elaborately decorated, climate controlled sets, that cover thousands of acres. In one novel, an entire island is created for the game; in another, a crater on the Moon is domed and heavily developed. Holograms (and later augmented reality glasses) are used for special effects. The blades on sharp weapons can be removed and replaced with holographic edges; this allows participants to engage in safe combat. A combination of computers and gamemasters monitor events, prompt actors playing non-protagonist parts, and resolve simulated actions. Thus, after a player&#x27;s character has been repeatedly struck with a holographic sword a computer might determine that he has died. The player will be informed that he should pantomime a death and is removed from play.

Although the Dream Park concept assumes future technology, it is still an expensive proposition. Players pay fees to play the games. In addition, the first game played is both broadcast live and recorded (the game areas and player costumes include numerous cameras and other sensors). The creator of the game takes the recorded footage and edits it into a movie (with enhanced post-production effects) and other media for resale. While the resulting movies are heavily influenced by the game&#x27;s creator, the actions of the players are unscripted. In this way the books anticipate reality television.

The games in the &quot;Dream Park&quot; series are heavily regulated. One of the regulatory groups is the International Fantasy Games Society or IFGS. The creator of a game has nearly unlimited power in the game; he could arbitrarily change a game to doom a given player&#x27;s character to death and eject the player from the game. IFGS existed to protect the interests of players and limit abuse by game creators. One group of fantasy based live action role-playing gamers have taken the IFGS name for their rules and organization.

In each of the novels, the plot moves at multiple levels. The reader is given parallel stories involving the game story itself as the player characters learn the scenario, solve various puzzles and engage in simulated battles with enemies; the players and their real-world relationships with each other and the game organizers; events affecting the venue staff; and usually some kind of out-of-game plot or conspiracy that will impact everyone involved. These are high-stakes games with massive publicity and cutting-edge technology, and they are therefore attractive to a variety of criminals.

== Plot ==

Most games are reruns, with team after team of players attempting to complete the pre-packaged adventure. But someone always has to be first – and every player wants to be part of the initial team that beta tests a game. To have the author/programmer themself serve as the game master, to face surprises no one has seen, even the most jaded of elite players compete fiercely for such a spot.

And &quot;South Seas Treasure Hunt&quot; promises to be a doozy. The Game Master, Richard Lopez is one of the best authors in the business, while Chester Henderson (team captain of the players) is a living legend . . .and the two hate each other. Players from around the world have gathered for a chance to play in the biggest grudge match in Gaming history.

And the game opens with a bang. Sent to (simulated) Melanesia to retrieve some sort of World War II-era superweapon, dark magic rips Henderson&#x27;s team out of the sky, forcing them to fight their way across New Guinea. Demigods, Cargo Cult magicians, and an army of laughing zombies stand between them and victory.

But even as Henderson&#x27;s team hacks their way through the jungle, the real world threatens the game. A multi-million dollar experimental prototype has been stolen from Dream Park R&amp;D, and a guard murdered. And all the evidence suggests that someone from within the game is responsible.

Caught between the loss of millions from the prototype, and the loss of millions if they stop the game, the higher-ups hit on an unusual solution. Alex Griffin, the head of Dream Park security, will go undercover as a player in the Game. Solve a murder mystery, help a bunch of crazies play dress-up—how hard can it be?

== &quot;Barsoom Project&quot; ==

The Fimbulwinter Game has a terrible reputation. Set in (simulated) Northern Alaska, it was supposed to explore Inuit mythology, with players heading off a Lovecraftian cult&#x27;s efforts to plunge the world into a new ice age. Right up until one of the players accidentally shot several people, when a real gun was mixed in with the props.

As a result, no one has played the Fimbulwinter Game in years. But some enterprising individuals want to repackage it as a &quot;fat ripper special&quot;, the LARP equivalent of a diet and exercise program. The challenges are re-themed to force the participants to improve their eating habits, and rethink their lifestyle. And so a team of overweight weekend warriors set off to save the world.

Meanwhile, the rest of Dream Park is closed to the public. The company is pitching investors on a mission to Mars, and some of the wealthiest people in the world are there to review the proposal (and have the theme park rides all to themselves).

But the &quot;accident&quot; all those years ago was no accident – the gun was deliberately planted there. An old enemy has returned, lurking among the investors. Someone who looks at the Barsoom Proposal, and sees only new ways to inflict global terror – and ruin Dream Park in the process.

But that is not the only surprise. There is someone among the players who shouldn&#x27;t be there. Someone whose life was ruined by the original Fimbulwinter Game. 

== &quot;California Voodoo Game&quot; ==

Things have never been better for Dream Park. The Barsoom Project is in full gear, and promises to be the crowning jewel in the company&#x27;s corporate crown. Further, they&#x27;re hosting this year&#x27;s LARP &quot;superbowl&quot;, where five competing teams will race each other to discover the secrets of an abandoned &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; arcology, way out in the desert. The California Voodoo Game promises to be so big, it has actually lured some of the best players in the world out of retirement.

Even better, the arcology is scheduled to be re-used as the center of the Barsoom Project, once California Voodoo ends. Coupled with various tax incentives, the savings promise to be equally astronomical.

Some of the players, though, have more on their mind than just adventuring. One of the most ruthless and manipulative players ever, Bishop is a living legend, and self-proclaimed cheat. Never been caught, though, and bringing him in as one of the five captains ensures even more attention to this year&#x27;s Super Bowl. But is he here to win? Or something else? Every interview he gives raises more eyebrows.

As the players prowl through the arcology, battling zombies, bargaining with voodoo gods, and befriending giant alien catfish, Alex Griffin&#x27;s life falls apart. He has never really recovered from the corruption he unearthed during the South Seas and Fimbulwinter Games, and the broken friendships that followed. Worse, Acacia Garcia (his former flame) is captaining one of the Super Bowl teams – and she looks amazing.

Then he gets a call from the police. His current girlfriend (and coworker) has been found murdered in a sleezy love hotel. And a routine review of her computer records indicate that she was downloading files about California Voodoo, mere hours before her death. Back in the game, all of the Super Bowl teams are behaving oddly.

== &quot;Moon Maze Game&quot; ==

In &quot;The Moon Maze Game&quot;, gamers travel to the Moon in 2085. Their game is set in the British Empire in the 19th century and takes place on the moon as imagined by H.G. Wells. 

One of the gamers is Prince Ali, heir to the ruler of the Republic of Kikaya. A group of mercenaries infiltrates the game dome to kidnap Ali in order to compel his father to step down from his throne. The players, including Ali, are captured but manage to escape. Although the mercenaries have cut off communications between the game dome in Botanica crater and the main Heinlein station, visuals continue to broadcast as the game turns into a real-life pursuit and battle between the gamers and the mercenaries.

== Cultural references ==
The novels &quot;Achilles&#x27; Choice&quot; and &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Race&quot;, also by Niven and Barnes, are set in the 2020s and feature a quick reference to &quot;Dream Park&quot; technologies. The events of another novel, &quot;The Descent of Anansi&quot;, by the same authors, are referred to in the latter two books of the &quot;Dream Park&quot; trilogy.

An antecedent to &quot;Dream Park&quot; is the 1973 movie &quot;Westworld&quot;, in which vacationers pay to spend time in one of several historical role-playing &quot;worlds&quot; (including one set in the US Old West).

The (real world) game show, The Crystal Maze, makes an appearance in &quot;The California Voodoo Game&quot;, with two of the &quot;superbowl&quot; teams challenging each other in a futuristic version as a warm-up for the titular Game.

==Theme park==
In the mid-1990s a real company (Dream Park Corporation) took the Dream Park name to try to realize many of the ideas in the books. Their stated goal was a large theme park with ongoing minor events in which attendees could participate. They would also run the sort of immersive games described in the books. The company made a number of adjustments for limits to existing technology. Instead of holographic weapons, players had foam-rubber weapons. Plans were to attach sensors to the weapons and players. The sensors would beam information about strikes to computers that would track a simulated health for each character. Players would wear headsets, a radio allowing the computers and game masters to inform players of important status information. A head-up display on the headset would display special effects like a dragon&#x27;s fiery breath or a magical spell.

The complete theme park was never built, though a fantasy dungeon was created and tested. The company eventually went bankrupt in 1997. The new attraction MagiQuest in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina follows a similar combat-less approach using electronically enhanced wands that interact with objects around the attraction.

==Role-playing game==
A tabletop role-playing game was also produced under the title &quot;Dream Park&quot; (making it a role-playing game based on a book about a role-playing game). The book was written by Mike Pondsmith and published by R. Talsorian Games.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Dream Park&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #11 and commented that &quot;&quot;Dream Park&quot; is Niven&#x27;s best novel in a long time. It shows flair and imagination not evident in, for example, &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;; the multi-level plot is more than intriguing enough to hold the reader&#x27;s attention.&quot;

<doc id="1176026" wikidata="Q7380161" url="?curid=1176026" title="Runza">
<text>A runza (also called a krautburger, or kraut pirok) is a yeast dough bread pocket with a filling consisting of ground beef, cabbage or sauerkraut, onions, and seasonings. Runzas can be baked into various shapes such as a half-moon, a rectangle, a round (bun), a square, or a triangle. The runzas sold by the Runza restaurant chain are rectangular while many of the bierocks sold in Kansas are round buns.

The runza is a regional cuisine of Nebraska, with some commentators calling it &quot;as Nebraskan as Cornhusker football.&quot; It is served by the Nebraska Society of Washington, D.C., and the Nebraska Society of New York at their Taste of Nebraska events and was chosen to represent the state at Flavored Nation, an event serving iconic dishes from all fifty states.

==History==
The runza sandwich originated from the &quot;pirog&quot;, an Eastern European baked good or more specifically from its small version, known as &quot;pirozhok&quot; (literally &quot;little &quot;pirog&quot;&quot;). In the 18th century, Volga Germans (ethnic Germans who settled in the Volga River valley in the Russian Empire at the invitation of Catherine the Great because of their skill in farming), adapted the &quot;pirog&quot; /&quot;pirozhok&quot; to create the bierock, a yeast pastry sandwich with similar savory ingredients. When the political climate turned against the Volga Germans as part of Russification including the threat of conscription into the Russian army beginning in 1871, many emigrated to the United States, creating communities across the Great Plains. These immigrants, including the Brening family that settled near Sutton, Nebraska, brought their bierock recipes with them. Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Everett (&quot;née&quot; Brening), originally of Sutton, is credited with adapting her family&#x27;s bierock recipe into the runza and also inventing the name for the sandwich. In 1949, Everett went into business selling runzas with her brother Alex in Lincoln, founding the Runza restaurant chain.

=== Etymology ===
Many sources agree that Sally Everett invented the name &quot;runza&quot; although it is likely she adapted it from an existing name for the sandwich; either the , an older, different German name for the bierock, or the Low German , meaning &quot;belly&quot;, alluding to the gently rounded shape of the pouch pastry. The modern German , also meaning satchel, derives from . The word &quot;runza&quot; is registered as a trademark in the United States, held by the Runza restaurant chain.

<doc id="1176028" wikidata="Q351466" url="?curid=1176028" title="Biscuit joiner">
<text>A biscuit joiner or biscuit jointer (or sometimes plate joiner) is a woodworking tool used to join two pieces of wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.

==History==
The biscuit joining system was invented in 1956 in Liestal, Switzerland, by Hermann Steiner. Steiner opened his carpenter&#x27;s shop in 1944, and, in the middle of the 1950s, while looking for a simple means of joining the recently introduced chipboard, invented the Lamello joining system. In the succeeding years there followed further developments such as the circular saw and the first stationary biscuit (plate) joining machine in 1956 followed by the first portable biscuit joiner for Lamello grooves in 1968. In 1969 the family operation was incorporated by the name of Lamello AG. Lamello continues to manufacture biscuit joiners.
Several other companies such as Porter Cable, DeWalt and Makita also manufacture compatible biscuit joiners, including some models with interchangeable blades, enabling the user to cut both biscuit slots.

==Production==
Biscuits are predominantly used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing mortise and tenon joints, as biscuit joints are easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important to use the same face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.

Biscuits are also used to align edges of workpieces, such as when forming a 90° angle between workpieces. The biscuit provides a quick means of getting a perfectly flush joint, while at the same time reinforcing the joint.

Typically, the machine will have an adjustable fence, so it can be set on an angle for joining mitered pieces.

Also, there are other types of specialty biscuits available, from metal connectors, used for removable panels, to hinges, making these portable machines even more flexible.

==Usage==
The workpieces are brought together and the user marks the location for the biscuits. Precise measurement is not required, as the biscuits are hidden when the pieces are assembled, so a quick pencil stroke that marks both pieces where they align is all that is required. The parts are separated and the machine is used to cut the slots in each piece. The machine has reference marks on the centerline of the blade for easy alignment to the marks on the materials being joined.

The body of the machine with the blade is spring-loaded, and in the normal position the blade is retracted. The operator aligns the machine and uses firm pressure to push the body forward against the base plate to make the cut. The waste material is blown out of the slot on the right of the base plate.

Because the slots are slightly longer than the biscuits, it is still possible to slide the panels sideways after the joint is assembled (before the glue sets). This fact makes the biscuit joiner easy to use, because it does not require extreme accuracy or jigs to achieve perfect joints.

The depth of the cut can be altered by an adjustable stop. The smaller base can be rotated through 90°, and accessories are provided for altering the offset of the base to the blade (for use with thicker or thinner materials as required). Some models allow slots to be cut at angles other than 90° to the joining face, for example 45°, which greatly speeds up the assembly of things like cabinets.

==Standard biscuit sizes==

Six-depth settings of biscuit joiner (six-size biscuits with no blade change) include Nos. 00, 10, 20, D, S, S6

==Sizes of Porter Cable biscuits==
The sizes were taken verbatim from the Porter-Cable website.

==Detail biscuit sizes==
Detail biscuits are smaller than standard biscuits and are typically used to join smaller pieces of wood together, and offer less structural support.

==Blades and depth==
For most portable plate joiners, a nominal 4-inch or 100 mm diameter blade is used for the Nos. 0, 10, 20 biscuit cuts. The blade is set deeper for joining the larger biscuits. Most blades have 4, 6, or 8 teeth and fit a -inch or 22 mm arbor. The thickness of the blade is typically 0.156 to 0.160 inch or nominally 4 mm.

<text>The Bauzi or Baudi tribe is a group people living in the north-central part of the Indonesian province of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya). The Bauzi area consists of much of the west side of lower Mamberamo River area in northern Papua. The Bauzi people lived on hunting and gathering in the jungle. While the Bauzi people were historically an animistic people group, they are now 65% Christian. For the most part, tribal warfare is no longer a large part of Bauzi culture and all Bauzi people speak the same language. In recent years, linguists have been studying the language and translating various literature, including the Bible, into the Bauzi language.

<doc id="1176037" wikidata="Q785140" url="?curid=1176037" title="List of The West Wing characters">
<text>The television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; is a political drama series which was originally broadcast on NBC.

During its seven seasons the ensemble cast of stars, recurring stars, and guest stars earned 157 acting nominations (often competing in the same category against other members of the cast) across a variety of award-granting organizations, earning 30 awards. Many actors noted for work in sitcoms appeared in dramatic roles on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, including John Goodman, Alan Alda, John Larroquette, Christopher Lloyd, Ed O&#x27;Neill, Matthew Perry, Patricia Richardson, Lily Tomlin, Wayne Wilderson, and Daniel von Bargen.

== Main cast ==
: 
== White House staff ==

* Madeline &quot;Mandy&quot; Hampton (Moira Kelly): Political consultant during Bartlet&#x27;s first campaign. Worked as a media consultant at Lennox-Chase after the campaign. Briefly consults for Democratic Senator Lloyd Russell before being hired by the White House as a political consultant and media director (season 1). She is not seen or mentioned again after the first season.
* Amelia &quot;Amy&quot; Gardner (Mary-Louise Parker): Head of the Women&#x27;s Leadership Coalition and influential women&#x27;s rights activist. Works as a political consultant for Senator Howard Stackhouse when he runs for president. Later hired as the Chief of Staff for the Office of the First Lady. Resigns after she upsets the President (Seasons 3–5). Agrees to become the Director of Legislative Affairs in the Santos administration (season 7).
* Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Calley (Mark Feuerstein): Majority Counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee during the Bartlet censure proceedings (season 3) and a Republican. During the censure hearings, he helps facilitate a schedule delay which allows Leo McGarry to avoid potentially damaging testimony.
* Angela Blake (Michael Hyatt): Worked for Leo McGarry while he was Secretary of Labor. While a political consultant, she is hired to be Director of Legislative Affairs (season 5). She is not seen or mentioned again after the budget crisis is over and Josh Lyman regains his effective leadership.

=== Other White House staffers ===

* Dolores Landingham (Kathryn Joosten and Kirsten Nelson in flashback in &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot;): The President&#x27;s executive secretary (season 1–2). Killed in a car accident (episode &quot;18th and Potomac&quot; at the end of season two). Appears in flashbacks (Seasons 3–4). Referred to simply as &quot;Mrs Landingham&quot; almost always by everyone including the president.
* Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Fiderer (Lily Tomlin): The President&#x27;s executive secretary, hired after the death of the previous secretary, Mrs Landingham (Seasons 4–7). Charlie arranges her first interview with the President against her own wishes, in which she is groggy from prescription medication and performs badly by confessing to being both a professional gambler and then an alpaca farmer. Charlie later successfully pushes for her to be re-considered. When President Bartlet learns the reason she lost her previous White House personnel job — she had defied the Director of Personnel by hiring Charlie rather than a wealthy Bartlet supporter&#x27;s unqualified son — and, though appearing very quirky, he sees she is actually very smart and capable, he hires her on the spot.
* Margaret Hooper (NiCole Robinson): Assistant to chiefs of staff Leo McGarry (Seasons 1–6) and C. J. Cregg (Seasons 6–7). She is often focused on the minutiae of life. Particular devoted to and protective of Leo — frequently found snooping in on his private meetings — but she has a rebellious streak, so they are often at odds with their working styles. She is visibly pregnant in season 6, with no clear information about the father, and her baby is never seen on the show.
* Bonnie (Devika Parikh): Assistant to Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Seasons 1–5).
* Carol Fitzpatrick (Melissa Fitzgerald): Assistant to Press Secretary C. J. Cregg (Seasons 1–7).
* Ginger (Kim Webster): Assistant to Communications Director Toby Ziegler and Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Seasons 1–7).

* Lauren Chin (Catherine Kwong): Intern at the White House Press Office (season 4).
* Marina (&quot;Rina&quot;) (Melissa Marsala): Assistant to Communications Director Toby Ziegler (season 5). Causes consternation among staff members by wearing revealing outfits in the West Wing office areas, raising concerns over potential harassment complaints or perceived lack of professionalism.
* Nancy (Renée Estevez): President&#x27;s Confidential Assistant (Seasons 1–7). Estevez is the daughter of Martin Sheen, who plays the President.
* Ed (Peter James Smith): White House staffer usually seen with Larry.
* Larry (William Duffy): White House staffer usually seen with Ed.
* Ryan Pierce (Jesse Bradford): White House intern assigned to Josh and nephew of a powerful senator; great-great-great grandson of the 14th U.S. president, Franklin Pierce (Season 5). Toward the end of that season, he becomes a top aide to a Democratic congressman whom Josh dislikes, and is not seen or mentioned after that.
* Curtis Carruthers (Ben Murray): Succeeds Charlie Young as personal aide to the President (season 6).

=== Office of the White House Counsel ===

* Lionel Tribbey (John Larroquette): The fourth White House Counsel of the Bartlet administration and the first to appear in the series. He has very liberal views and is animated and theatrical.
* Oliver Babish (Oliver Platt): The fifth and final White House Counsel of the Bartlet administration and the second of the two characters to be shown in that position during the series. Diligent and zealous, he first appears advising President Bartlet when the President is considering revealing his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis to the public. He appears connected to this plot-line into season three, then returns to the series in season seven to participate in the White House&#x27;s internal investigation into the military shuttle leak. He later decamps to a law firm in the wake of the outgoing Bartlet Administration and is later mentioned by Santos as a potential choice for Attorney General. He is described by Josh Lyman as &quot;smart and tough&quot;.
* Ainsley Hayes (Emily Procter): Associate (and proposed Deputy) White House Counsel (Seasons 2–3). Conservative Republican from North Carolina. Graduate of Harvard Law School. After she soundly defeats and embarrasses Sam during a debate on the political talk show &quot;Capital Beat&quot;, President Bartlet tells Leo McGarry to offer her a job, which after initially believing she is being rebuked, she thinks is either a joke or a terrible idea, but when seeing the White House staff in action in a crisis, leads her to accept the Associate White House Counsel&#x27;s post. Primarily, she appears as a foil to Sam Seaborn, making him reconsider his position on policies. She briefly reappears in season 7, wanting to become White House Counsel for the Santos Administration with Josh planning on getting her a meeting with Santos.
* Joe Quincy (Matthew Perry): Associate White House Counsel (Seasons 4–5). Republican. He uncovers Vice President Hoynes&#x27;s leaking of information during an affair with local socialite Helen Baldwin, ultimately leading to Hoynes&#x27;s resignation.
* Mike Wayne (Benjamin Brown): Associate White House Counsel (season 4–7). Deals with Toby after he admits to being the source of the military space shuttle leak.
* Richard Squire (Michael Kostroff): Associate White House Counsel (season 6). Graduate of Yale Law School and a Rhodes Scholar.

=== Situation Room ===

* Admiral Percy &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzwallace (John Amos): Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Seasons 1–5). Fitzwallace is a career surface warfare officer. Following his retirement, while he is on a special diplomatic mission in Palestine at Bartlet&#x27;s particular request, he is killed in a terrorist road-side bombing of his car, in which Donna Moss is also badly injured, at the culmination of the fifth season. 
* General Nicholas Alexander (Terry O&#x27;Quinn): an ex-Green Beret. He succeeds Admiral Fitzwallace as a much more hawkish Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Seasons 5–6).
* Dr. Nancy McNally (Anna Deavere Smith): National Security Advisor. She can appear to be either a &#x27;war dove&#x27; or &#x27;war hawk&#x27; depending upon the situation, but is always fair and usually right on the money with a situation. It is suggested that she becomes U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (Seasons 2–7). 
* Lieutenant Commander Jack Reese (Christian Slater): Aide to National Security Advisor Nancy McNally (season 4) and briefly dates Donna.
* Commander Kate Harper (Mary McCormack): Deputy National Security Advisor (Seasons 5–7), who takes on many of Nancy McNally&#x27;s White House duties.
* Lieutenant General Alan Adamle (Gerald McRaney): A three-star general in the USAF. Meets with Leo to discuss the International Criminal Court in episode 3.05 and stuns Leo by revealing Leo once (completely inadvertently) bombed a non-military target and killed innocent civilians, telling a devastated Leo this story to lead to his view that &quot;All wars are crimes&quot;. He also briefs then President-elect Bartlet on a small delegation of military advisers being sent to the Philippines three days after the presidential election in episode 5.22. Served with Leo in Vietnam.
* General Shannon (Daniel von Bargen): Appears in episodes (2.01) and (2.10). A four-star general in the USAF; Leo calls him &quot;Jack&quot; in his first episode and &quot;Ken&quot; in his second appearance. He seems to be the senior officer in the Situation Room in episode 2.01 until Nancy McNally arrives.
* Lieutenant General Ed Barrie (Tom Bower): Army Chief of Staff. He appears in episode 2.05 berating C.J. for reprimanding his intentions to condemn on TV the President&#x27;s failure to ensure military preparedness before his retirement, but is left silent when C.J. tells him he is wearing a Distinguished Combat Service Medal he had not earned; later however, Bartlet says the General served his country bravely and would face no White House censorship of any of his views. Despite being identified as Army Chief of Staff, he is portrayed as a three-star lieutenant general.
* General Mitch Jensen (Christopher Kriesa): A three-star Army general. Present in the Situation Room during discussions of retaliatory options to Morris Tolliver&#x27;s USAF medical transport being shot down in episode 1.03. Also advises the President on the India–Kashmir crisis in episodes 1.11 and 1.12.
* Colonel Mark Chase (David Graf): Air Force officer who advises Leo on a crisis with Iraqi oil smugglers in episode 2.07, and monitors the Missile Defense Shield test in episode 2.12.
* CIA Director George Rollie (Ryan Cutrona): President Bartlet does not trust or like him, but as C.J. and Toby note in &quot;365 Days&quot;, his pariah status is useful because it prevents the President from tearing down anyone else during tense situations.
* Mr Cashman: (unseen character) Often mentioned alongside Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill, implied to be a senior official at one of the Executive Branch departments, the department of either State or Defense (Seasons 1–2).
* Bobby Dunn (Gary Cervantes): Appears in episodes (1.11), (1.22), (2.01), (2.10), and (2.21); apparently a State Department official.
* Albie Duncan (Hal Holbrook): Assistant Secretary of State (office unstated). Longtime Republican and State Department elder (more than 40 years); is brought in by Leo (to the President&#x27;s discomfort and displeasure) to counsel the President on the submarine crisis off of North Korea in episode (3.06); later brought in by Toby during the reelection campaign to help C.J. spin the post-debate in episode (4.06).
* Ted Barrow (Ron Canada): Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Appears in Seasons 5–7. In season 5, tends to be harsh with the senior staffers and notably sympathetic to the views of North Korea; in later appearances, he is more measured and diplomatic.
* Bob Slattery (Thomas Kopache): Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. Appears in Seasons 3–7.
* Miguel &quot;Mickey&quot; Troop (Tony Plana): Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. Appears in season 2; advises the President on the DEA hostage crisis in Colombia, where he pushes for negotiations over a military solution and later outlines how dangerous and deadly a U.S. war against the major cartels would be.
* Mike Chysler (Glenn Morshower): (occasionally &quot;Jack&quot;); adviser to the President during his first term, regularly appearing in the Situation Room. Briefs the President on the DEA hostage crisis; also advises the President during the prelude to the assassination of Abdul Shareef near the end of Season 3. Appears in Seasons 2–4.

=== Secret Service/FBI ===
* Ron Butterfield (Michael O&#x27;Neill): Head of the President&#x27;s Secret Service detail (Seasons 1–7).
* Mike Casper (Clark Gregg): FBI Special Agent, usually acting White House liaison (Seasons 2–5).

== Politicians ==

=== Federal executive branch ===
* Matt Santos (Jimmy Smits): Democratic candidate for president in 2006. Succeeds Josiah Bartlet as President of the United States. Three-term U.S. Representative from Texas.

Chosen to be the Cabinet&#x27;s &quot;designated survivor&quot; during President Bartlet&#x27;s first State of the Union address, later during the second term expressed concern about divided leadership when President Bartlet proposed invoking the 25th Amendment (Seasons 1 and 4).

=== Federal legislative branch ===
* Senator Seth Gillette (Ed Begley, Jr.): Democrat from North Dakota. He threatened to run against President Bartlet as a third-party candidate on a more left-wing platform in the 2002 election (Ep 2.14).
* Rep. Jeff Haffley (Steven Culp): Republican from Washington; House Majority Whip, 1997–2003, Speaker of the House, 2003–2007
* Senator Howard Stackhouse (George Coe) Democrat from Minnesota. He ran a liberal third-party candidacy for the Presidency in 2002 but later endorsed President Bartlet (Ep 2–17, 4.04, 4–06).
* Senator Arnold Vinick  (Alan Alda): Republican from California. Republican candidate for president in 2006 (Seasons 6–7). Nominee for Secretary of State in Santos Administration (season 7). Senator from 1983 to 2007, was California&#x27;s senior US Senator in 2006. Chairman of a powerful Senate Committee (either Judiciary or Finance), and also served on the Foreign Relations and Environment Committees.
* Rep. Glen Allen Walken (John Goodman): Republican from Missouri; House Majority Whip, 1995–1997; House Majority Leader, 1997–2001; Speaker of the House, 2001–2003. He became Acting President of the United States when President Bartlet temporarily relinquished power. Later a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2006 election, though he never appeared on screen in that capacity.

=== State governors ===
* Eric Baker (Ed O&#x27;Neill): Governor of Pennsylvania. He is widely tipped as a front runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2006, but Baker&#x27;s surprise decision not to run at the outset leaves the race wide open. When the convention is deadlocked, Baker enters the race from the floor as a draft candidate, but withdraws over fallout due to the discovery of his non-disclosure of his wife&#x27;s depression. President-elect Santos nominates him for vice president following the death of Leo McGarry. (Seasons 6—7)
* Robert Ritchie (James Brolin): Governor of Florida. He was the Republican nominee for president in 2002 but was defeated by President Bartlet. (Seasons 3—4)
*Ray Sullivan (Brett Cullen): Governor of West Virginia. Republican nominee for vice president in 2006. Served as a U.S. Attorney and Attorney General of West Virginia before becoming governor. (Seasons 6–7)

==Foreign officials==
* Maureen Graty (Pamela Salem): Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (season 6)
* Lord John Marbury (Roger Rees): British ambassador
* Defense Minister Abdul ibn Shareef of Qumar (Al No&#x27;mani): Brother of the Sultan and terrorist leader, assassinated by the United States. (Ep. 3.22)

== Campaign staff ==
* Bruno Gianelli (Ron Silver): A sharp political operative and consultant introduced in the third season as the campaign manager of Bartlet&#x27;s 2002 bid for reelection, his unmatched track record of victories includes a House district that no Democrat has won for decades, several different U.S. senators and state governors, and a win for an unspecified Israeli prime minister. The character reappears as Eric Baker&#x27;s campaign manager for the 2006 Democratic primary, only to become an independent consultant to Republican nominee Arnold Vinick after Baker withdraws from the race. The change of political affiliations mirrored Ron Silver&#x27;s real-world change of party affiliation, as the noted liberal actor campaigned for President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election.
* Josephine &quot;Joey&quot; Lucas (Marlee Matlin): A political consultant and pollster who is often hired by the White House and Democratic campaigns. Usually, her interactions with Bartlet or Matt Santos are arranged by Josh Lyman, who has a crush on her early on. However, their relationship remains platonic and professional. Lucas first appears in the first season as the hard-hitting, sarcastic campaign manager for a Democratic House candidate whom the White House does not take seriously.

* Doug Wegland (Evan Handler): A Bartlet–Hoynes reelection campaign staffer and speechwriter (season 3), he is acerbic and finds himself offside with Toby Ziegler but ends up winning the staffers&#x27; respect with his good ideas and staunch belief in them (particularly his push for a presidential veto on the &quot;death tax&quot; that leads to a major political victory for the administration).

=== Santos campaign ===
* Louise &quot;Lou&quot; Thornton (Janeane Garofalo): an intelligent lobbyist described by Santos as having a &quot;completely different take on the campaign&quot; and by Josh as knowing &quot;image stuff backwards and sideways&quot;, she only reluctantly agrees to Josh&#x27;s request to join the Santos—–McGarry campaign as Director of Communications, when Santos agrees she can report to him directly. She acts as Josh&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; deputy throughout the campaign, and at Josh&#x27;s persuasion, accepts her appointment as Santos&#x27;s Director of Communications (season 7).
* Ronna Beckman (Karis Campbell): Santos&#x27;s personal assistant. She is present from the very beginning of Matt Santos&#x27;s campaign for the presidency in season 6 (appearing as part of his Congressional staff). In her final appearance, Deborah Fiderer trains her as Santos&#x27;s executive secretary, warning her never to revoke the First Lady&#x27;s walk-in privileges, even as the President is certain to request it.

=== Vinick campaign ===
* Sheila Brooks (Patricia Richardson): Senator Vinick&#x27;s chief of staff and Vinick–Sullivan campaign manager; She, like Vinick, is portrayed as level-headed and not overtly partisan. Often at odds with the more conservative voices in the party, she leaves the campaign weeks before election day to placate the Republican base (season 6–7). In her final appearance, Brooks is mentioned as possibly being hired as Chief of Staff to the Republican Senate Majority Leader. Having renewed her friendship with Vinick, she makes an argument that convinces the Senator that he should not run for president again—and that he should accept President-elect Santos&#x27; offer to become the next Secretary of State.
* Jane Braun (Melinda McGraw): Vinick–Sullivan campaign manager after Brooks&#x27; resignation (season 7); A far-to-the-right conservative activist who replaces Sheila to energize hard-core GOP voters. However, she disgusts the rest of the campaign leadership by attempting to make an election night issue of Leo McGarry&#x27;s death. Her outspoken partisanship puts her at odds with Vinick, Sheila, and Bruno Gianelli.
* Bruno Gianelli (Ron Silver): (See above).
* Bob Mayer (Stephen Root): Vinick–Sullivan speechwriter (season 6–7). Frequently mocked for his messy eating habits but extremely smart and effective (and, like Vinick and Sheila Brooks, level-headed in his conservatism), Mayer becomes fast friends with Gianelli. On election night, the two briefly discuss forming a consulting firm when Mayer firmly declares he is never going to become involved in daily governance, but Gianelli politely declines because the campaign life has worn him down and he plans to retire to his home in upstate New York. Along with Sheila, Bob advises Vinick to accept Santos&#x27; offer as the next Secretary of State.

He writes a story that reveals the classified information that a military space shuttle exists that could be used to rescue three astronauts on the International Space Station who are running out of oxygen. Brock’s source is initially suspected to be C. J. Cregg, whose phone records show a large number of calls to him. He refuses to reveal his source, is accordingly held in contempt of court, and goes to jail.

<text>Four ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Leviathan&quot;:

* The first &quot;Leviathan&quot; was a 70-gun third-rate ship of the line launched in 1750 as &quot;Northumberland&quot;, renamed in 1777 and sunk in 1780 in the Atlantic.
* The second was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1790. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, was used as a convict ship from 1816 and sold in 1848.
* The third was a armoured cruiser launched in 1901 and sold for scrap in 1920.
* The fourth &quot;Leviathan&quot; was a aircraft carrier. She was launched in 1945 but never completed and scrapped in 1968.

==Other uses==
HMS &quot;Leviathan&quot; was also the subject of John Winton&#x27;s 1967 novel of the same name, concerning a troubled aircraft carrier and its new executive officer. The novel details the trials and tribulations of Commander Bob Markready who tries to inspire his sailors and airmen alike to get the warship back on track. He is let down by air staff, his captain, and the British Admiralty. Very few of his colleagues appreciate the work put in by him and his achievements. At the end, he is quite unceremoniously transferred from the ship and posted as a naval attache in Washington, D.C.

<text>A controlling interest is an ownership interest in a corporation with enough voting stock shares to prevail in any stockholders&#x27; motion. A majority of voting shares (over 50%) is always a controlling interest. When a party holds less than the majority of the voting shares, other present circumstances can be considered to determine whether that party is still considered to hold a controlling ownership interest.

In the United States, Delaware corporations have a 2/3 vote requirement for a motion to pass. In theory, this could mean that a controlling interest would have to be over two-thirds of the voting shares.

A 2019 study published in the Virginia Law Review said dual-class stock structures, common to newly public technology companies, creates governance risks and costs, including the potential loss of economic value for non-voting shares held by public investors.

<text>Bangkok Hilton is a three-part Australian mini-series made in 1989 by Kennedy Miller Productions and directed by Ken Cameron. The title of the mini-series is the nickname of a fictional Bangkok prison in which the main protagonist (Nicole Kidman) is imprisoned, a mordant reference to Hanoi Hilton, the nickname for a prison used by North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

==Plot==
=== Episode one ===
In 1960s Sydney, Hal Stanton (Denholm Elliott) falls in love with Katherine Faulkner (Judy Morris), who has led a sheltered life at an isolated cattle station in the Australian outback.

After a brief, passionate affair, Hal&#x27;s dark secret is revealed. During WWII, while a prisoner of war of the Japanese in Bangkok, Hal turned in soldiers under his command who were planning an escape from prison. The Japanese executed the men. After the war, Hal was court-martialed. Hal betrayed the soldiers to protect the rest of his men from execution in reprisals, but this was considered irrelevant. He was disowned by his family and lived with shame ever since.

Katherine&#x27;s family breaks up the relationship and Hal moves despondently away. Soon after, Katherine gives birth to their child, Katrina. A delicate, asthmatic girl, Kat, is raised alone at the estate and treated as a shameful product of the illicit affair.

Twenty years later, Katherine dies, and Kat (Nicole Kidman) inherits the family fortune, also learning from the family lawyer that her father is not dead, as she was told all her life.

Having never ventured off the estate, Kat travels to London, where Hal&#x27;s family lived, to track him down. She finds James Stanton (Lewis Fiander), the uncle she has never met, who considers Hal dead, due to his shameful behavior in WWII. Kat overcomes James&#x27;s resistance.

While in England, Kat meets a handsome American, Arkie Ragan (Jerome Ehlers), who sweeps her off her feet and invites her to travel with him back to Australia, by way of Goa. As Kat prepares to leave, James confesses that the family lawyer in Bangkok may know where Hal is.

In Goa, Arkie secretly picks up a shipment of narcotics and hides it in a camera case, which he gives to Kat as a gift. Kat decides to go to Bangkok to hunt down the family lawyer. Arkie strenuously objects to traveling through Thailand, but Kat insists.

In Bangkok, the family lawyer, Richard Carlisle (Hugo Weaving), is unwilling to help. Reluctantly returning to Australia, Katrina is arrested at Bangkok airport when the drugs in her suitcase are discovered. Arkie disappears as Kat is detained by Thai authorities.

=== Episode two ===
Kat meets Carlisle in prison. He agrees to tell Hal where she is. Hal is reluctant to meet Kat, but Carlisle convinces Hal to visit her in prison under a false name, pretending to be Carlisle&#x27;s legal assistant. Hal is impressed by Kat&#x27;s strength.

Kat is charged with drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty. She is taken to squalid, overcrowded, Lum Jau Prison to await trial and placed in a cell with other foreigners, ironically nicknamed the &quot;Bangkok Hilton.&quot;

Mandy Engels (Joy Smithers), another Australian imprisoned for drug trafficking, teaches Kat how to sneak to the men&#x27;s side of the prison, to visit and care for Mandy&#x27;s cognitively disabled brother Billy (Noah Taylor), who was arrested with Mandy.

Carlisle convinces Hal to actively participate in the case, working with Kat, but maintaining his false identity as a junior lawyer. However, Hal flatly refuses to visit Kat in Lum Jau. He reveals to Carlisle that it is the same prison in which he was held by the Japanese 40 years earlier, and he cannot bear to enter its walls.

Hal finds the courage to go to Lum Jau. Based on Kat&#x27;s memories, Hal retraces her footsteps to London, where he is reunited with his estranged brother James.

=== Episode three ===
In London, every trace of Arkie turns into a dead end. Hal continues to Goa, where he chases Arkie to the airport and sees him across a crowd. However, without proof of any crime, Hal cannot convince the Indian police to do anything.

Mandy and Billy are sentenced to death and executed. Soon after, Kat is also found guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. The despondent Hal suddenly realizes that the escape tunnel that his men dug in WWII may still exist, as it was covered over when the Japanese discovered it. Kat will only have to get to the men&#x27;s side of the prison to access it.

Hal convinces Carlisle, whose entire life has been devoted to defending the law, to break the law in order to save the innocent Kat from execution. Kat reveals that she can sneak to the men&#x27;s side. After a failed attempt, Kat tries again the night before she&#x27;s to be moved to another prison for her execution. Kat sneaks to the men&#x27;s side, finds the escape tunnel, and uses it to get into the sewers, where she meets up with Hal and Carlisle. At the airport, Hal reveals to Kat that he is her father, as she boards her plane to Australia.

Hal escapes Bangkok and meets up with Kat in Goa, where they watch as Arkie is arrested and then walk together on the beach as father and daughter.

==Production==
The mini-series was inspired by the Barlow Chambers Case, which was also turned into a mini-series. Terry Hayes felt it would be the basis of a good mini-series if the story was changed so the person who went to prison was innocent. He was also inspired by the true story of an Irish woman who had fallen in love with an Arab who smuggled a bomb in her luggage.

Terry Hayes was originally meant to write the script but he was exhausted from &quot;Dead Calm&quot; (also starring Kidman) and Tony Morphett was given the job. However Morphett was too caught up in work on &quot;Sweet Talker&quot; (1989) and was unable to do it, so Hayes stepped back in.

The mini-series was specifically written as a vehicle for Nicole Kidman. It was shot over 13 weeks starting in March 1989.

==Locations==
The production was shot in Australia, Thailand, India, and England.

The majority of the locations were shot in Sydney. A former convalescent hospital in Concord, Sydney served as the Faulkner family estate. Green-screen technology was used to superimpose this manor-style house into a rural New South Wales setting.

Other Sydney locations included Balmain High School, the Water Board (MWB) facility in Waterloo, and the Metro Cinema in Kings Cross.

Additional indoor scenes based in Thailand were largely set-based in the Kennedy Miller Studios Sydney, apart from scenes involving escape from the prison hospital in the final episode. This and earlier minor scenes (before the incarceration) were filmed in a disused section of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in North Sydney, New South Wales.

The non-set-based shots required careful acoustic management to ensure uniformity of sound and continuity of light.

Overseas locations included Bangkok International Airport, the Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel in Bangkok, the Cidade de Goa Resort Hotel in Goa, Dabolim Airport in Goa, and London, England.

==Impact==
It was the highest rating mini-series of the year (1989) and was the last of the series of productions Kennedy Miller made for Network Ten. It was also one of the last mini-series that attracted a large viewing audience, before the demise of the mini-series boom of the 1980s. The mini-series was a huge ratings success in Australia, earning a share of 42%.

Later productions with similar stories include &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;. After the series aired, the name &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; has regularly been used in the media to refer to any and all Bangkok prisons as if those prisons were actually nicknamed &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; in real life. Some news reports state that the Lard Yao women&#x27;s prison carries the nickname &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; A 2004 BBC documentary about Bangkwang prison - a male-only prison - was titled &quot;The Real Bangkok Hilton&quot;. Some news reports have claimed that &quot;Bangkwang&quot; prison itself carries the real-life nickname &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot;.

==Versions==
The miniseries was originally broadcast in Australia on 10 TV Australia as three episodes on 5, 6, and 7 November 1989, each running two hours with adverts, for a complete running time of four-and-a-half hours. This version was also broadcast in the US on TBS in October 1990 with a few minor edits of seconds at a time for content and language.

In 2000 it was released on DVD in the United Kingdom. Each episode was cut in half, creating six new episodes with three episodes on each of two discs. This version mistakenly left the subtitles off an important scene which is spoken in the Thai language.

The bootleg version, commonly available from Russia and other countries, cuts the series down to ninety minutes, only a third of its original length.

The DVD version released in Australia in 2005 presents the series in the original three parts but has been cropped for widescreen televisions, from 1.33:1 to 1.78:1, cutting off the top and bottom of the film. Because of this, the opening and closing credits had to be redone and the final shot of the film, which played under the closing credits of episode 3, has thus been omitted.

<text>Steyr Tractor (properly called Steyr Landmaschinentechnik AG) is an Austrian agricultural machinery manufacturer. The company was founded in 1864 in St. Valentin, Austria, and manufactures tractors. It was part of the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate from 1934 until 1990 and was purchased by Case Corporation in 1996. Case IH and New Holland merged in 1999 to form CNH Global, which in turn merged with Fiat Industrial in 2012 to form CNH Industrial.

In 2020, the factory in St. Valentin had 600 employees, and produced around 10&#x27;000 tractors per year, both Case IH and Steyr. The tractors between 75 and 220 KW have engines from Fiat Powertrain Technologies.

<text>Ida Estelle Taylor (May 20, 1894 – April 15, 1958) was an American actress who was the second of world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey&#x27;s four wives. With &quot;dark-brown, almost black hair and brown eyes,&quot; she was regarded as one of the most beautiful silent film stars of the 1920s.

After her stage debut in 1919, Taylor began appearing in small roles in World and Vitagraph films. She achieved her first success with &quot;While New York Sleeps&quot; (1920), in which she played three different roles, including a femme fatale, or &quot;vamp.&quot; She was a contract player of Fox Film Corporation and, later, Paramount Pictures, but for the majority of her career she freelanced. She became famous and was commended by reviewers for her portrayals of historical women in important films: Miriam in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1923), Mary, Queen of Scots in &quot;Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall&quot; (1924), and Lucrezia Borgia in &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1926).

Although she made a successful transition to sound films, she retired from film acting in 1932 to focus entirely on her singing career. She was also active in animal welfare before her death from cancer in 1958. She was posthumously honored in 1960 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the motion pictures category.

==Early life==
Ida Estelle Taylor was born on May 20, 1894, in Wilmington, Delaware. Her father, Harry D. Taylor (born 1871), was born in Harrington, Delaware. Her mother, Ida LaBertha &quot;Bertha&quot; Barrett (1874–1965), was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, and later worked as a freelance makeup artist. The Taylors had another daughter, Helen (1898–1990), who also became an actress. According to the 1900 census, the family lived in a rented house at 805 Washington Street in Wilmington. In 1903, Ida LaBertha was granted a divorce from Harry on the ground of nonsupport; the following year, she married a cooper named Fred T. Krech. Ida LaBertha&#x27;s third husband was Harry J. Boylan, a vaudevillian.

Taylor was raised by her maternal grandparents, Charles Christopher Barrett and Ida Lauber Barrett. Charles Barrett ran a piano store in Wilmington, and Taylor studied piano. Her childhood ambition was to become a stage actress, but her grandparents initially disapproved of her theatrical aspirations. When she was ten years old she sang the role of &quot;Buttercup&quot; in a benefit performance of the opera &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in Wilmington. She attended high school but dropped out because she refused to apologize after a troublesome classmate caused her to spill ink from her inkwell on the floor. In 1911, she married bank cashier Kenneth M. Peacock. The couple remained together for five years until Taylor decided to become an actress. She soon found work as an artists&#x27; model, posing for Howard Pyle, Harvey Dunn, Leslie Thrasher, and other painters and illustrators.

In April 1918, Taylor moved to New York City to study acting at the Sargent Dramatic School. She worked as a hat model for a wholesale millinery store to earn money for her tuition and living expenses. At Sargent Dramatic School, she wrote and performed one-act plays, studied voice inflection and diction, and was noticed by a singing teacher named Mr. Samoiloff who thought her voice was suitable for opera. Samoiloff gave Taylor singing lessons on a contingent basis and, within several months, recommended her to theatrical manager Henry Wilson Savage for a part in the musical &quot;Lady Billy&quot;. She auditioned for Savage and he offered her work as an understudy to the actress who had the second role in the musical. At the same time, playwright George V. Hobart offered her a role as a &quot;comedy vamp&quot; in his play &quot;Come-On, Charlie&quot;, and Taylor, who had no experience in stage musicals, preferred the non-musical role and accepted Hobart&#x27;s offer.

==Career==
===Broadway debut and Fox (1919–1922)===
Taylor made her Broadway stage début in George V. Hobart&#x27;s &quot;Come-On, Charlie&quot;, which opened on April 8, 1919, at 48th Street Theatre in New York City. The story was about a shoe clerk who has a dream in which he inherits one million dollars and must make another million within six months. It was not a great success and closed after sixteen weeks. Taylor, the only person in the play who wore red beads, was praised by a New York City critic who wrote, &quot;The only point of interest in the show was the girl with the red beads.&quot; During the play&#x27;s run, producer Adolph Klauber saw Taylor&#x27;s performance and said to the play&#x27;s leading actress Aimee Lee Dennis: &quot;You know, I think Miss Taylor should go into motion pictures. That&#x27;s where her greatest future lies. Her dark eyes would screen excellently.&quot; Dennis told Taylor what Klauber said, and Taylor began looking for work in films. With the help of J. Gordon Edwards, she got a small role in the film &quot;A Broadway Saint&quot; (1919). She was hired by the Vitagraph Company for a role with Corinne Griffith in &quot;The Tower of Jewels&quot; (1920), and also played William Farnum&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1920) for the Fox Film Corporation.

One of Taylor&#x27;s early successes was in 1920 in Fox&#x27;s &quot;While New York Sleeps&quot; with Marc McDermott. Charles Brabin directed the film, and Taylor and McDermott play three sets of characters in different time periods. This film was lost for decades, but has been recently discovered and screened at a film festival in Los Angeles. Her next film for Fox, &quot;Blind Wives&quot; (1920), was based on Edward Knoblock&#x27;s play &quot;My Lady&#x27;s Dress&quot; and reteamed her with director Brabin and co-star McDermott. William Fox then sent her to Fox Film&#x27;s Hollywood studios to play a supporting role in a Tom Mix film. Just before she boarded the train for Hollywood, Brabin gave her some advice: &quot;Don&#x27;t think of supporting Mix in that play. Don&#x27;t play in program pictures. Never play anything but specials. Mr. Fox is about to put on &quot;Monte Cristo&quot;. You should play the part of Mercedes. Concentrate on that role and when you get to Los Angeles, see that you play it.&quot;

Taylor traveled with her mother, her canary bird, and her bull terrier, Winkle. She was excited about playing Mercedes and reread Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; on the train. When she arrived in Hollywood, she reported to Fox Studios and introduced herself to director Emmett J. Flynn, who gave her a copy of the script, but warned her that he already had another actress in mind for the role. Flynn offered her another part in the film, but she insisted on playing Mercedes and after much conversation was cast in the role. John Gilbert played Edmond Dantès in the film, which was eventually titled &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; (1922). Taylor later said that she, &quot;saw then that he [Gilbert] had every requisite of a splendid actor.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald&quot; critic wrote, &quot;Miss Taylor was as effective in the revenge section of the film as she was in the first or love part of the screened play. Here is a class of face that can stand a close-up without becoming a mere speechless automaton.&quot;

Fox also cast her as Gilda Fontaine, a &quot;vamp&quot;, in the 1922 remake of the 1915 Fox production &quot;A Fool There Was&quot;, the film that made Theda Bara a star. Robert E. Sherwood of &quot;Life&quot; magazine gave it a mixed review and observed: &quot;Times and movies have changed materially since then [1915]. The vamp gave way to the baby vamp some years back, and the latter has now been superseded by the flapper. It was therefore a questionable move on Mr. Fox&#x27;s part to produce a revised version of &quot;A Fool There Was&quot; in this advanced age.&quot; She played a Russian princess in the film &quot;Bavu&quot; (1923), a Universal Pictures production with Wallace Beery as the villain and Forrest Stanley as her leading man.

===Paramount Pictures (1923–1924)===

One of her most memorable roles is that of Miriam, the sister of Moses (portrayed by Theodore Roberts), in the biblical prologue of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1923), one of the most successful films of the silent era. Her performance in the DeMille film was considered a great acting achievement. Taylor&#x27;s younger sister, Helen, was hired by Sid Grauman to play Miriam in the Egyptian Theatre&#x27;s onstage prologue to the film.
Despite being ill with arthritis, she won the supporting role of Mary, Queen of Scots in &quot;Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall&quot; (1924), starring Mary Pickford. &quot;I&#x27;ve since wondered if my long illness did not, in some measure at least, make for realism in registering the suffering of the unhappy and tormented Scotch queen,&quot; she told a reporter in 1926.

===Freelance (1925–1929)===
In 1925, she and her husband Jack Dempsey starred in an American silent drama film, a cowboy movie titled &quot;Manhattan Madness&quot; directed by John McDermott. It was produced by Fine Arts Pictures and distributed through Associated Exhibitors.

She played Lucrezia Borgia in &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1926), Warner Bros.&#x27; first feature-length film with synchronized Vitaphone sound effects and musical soundtrack. The film also starred John Barrymore, Mary Astor and Warner Oland. &quot;Variety&quot; praised her characterization of Lucrezia: &quot;The complete surprise is the performance of Estelle Taylor as Lucretia [&quot;sic&quot;] Borgia. Her Lucretia is a fine piece of work. She makes it sardonic in treatment, conveying precisely the woman Lucretia is presumed to have been.&quot;

She was to have co-starred in a film with Rudolph Valentino, but he died just before production was to begin. One of her last silent films was &quot;New York&quot; (1927), featuring Ricardo Cortez and Lois Wilson.

In 1928, she and husband Dempsey starred in a Broadway play titled &quot;The Big Fight&quot;, loosely based around Dempsey&#x27;s boxing popularity, which ran for 31 performances at the Majestic Theatre.

She made a successful transition to sound films or &quot;talkies.&quot; Her first sound film was the comical sketch &quot;Pusher in the Face&quot; (1929).

===Sound films and later career (1930–1945)===
Notable sound films in which she appeared include &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1931), with Sylvia Sidney; the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931), with Richard Dix and Irene Dunne; and &quot;Call Her Savage&quot; (1932), with Clara Bow.

Taylor returned to films in 1944 with a small part in the Jean Renoir drama &quot;The Southerner&quot; (released in 1945), playing what journalist Erskine Johnson described as &quot;a bar fly with a roving eye. There&#x27;s a big brawl and she starts throwing beer bottles.&quot; Johnson was delighted with Taylor&#x27;s reappearance in the film industry: &quot;[Interviewing] Estelle was a pleasant surprise. The lady is as beautiful and as vivacious as ever, with the curves still in the right places.&quot; &quot;The Southerner&quot; was her last film.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Taylor married three times, but never had children. In 1911 at age 17, she married a bank cashier named Kenneth Malcolm Peacock, the son of a prominent Wilmington businessman. They lived together for five years and then separated so she could pursue her acting career in New York. Taylor later claimed the marriage was annulled. In August 1924, the press mentioned Taylor&#x27;s engagement to boxer and world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey. In September, Peacock announced he would sue Taylor for divorce on the ground of desertion. He denied he would name Dempsey as co-respondent, saying &quot;If she wants to marry Dempsey, it is all right with me.&quot; Taylor was granted a divorce from Peacock on January 9, 1925.

Taylor and Dempsey were married on February 7, 1925, at First Presbyterian Church in San Diego, California. They lived in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. Her marriage to Dempsey ended in divorce on September 21, 1931.

Her third husband was theatrical producer Paul Small. Of her last husband and their marriage, she said: &quot;We have been friends and Paul has managed my stage career for five years, so it seemed logical that marriage should work out for us, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to say that the reason it has not worked out is incompatibility.&quot;

===Animal rights activism===
In her later years, Taylor devoted her free time to her pets and was known for her work as an animal rights activist. &quot;Whenever the subject of compulsory rabies inoculation or vivisection came up,&quot; wrote the United Press, &quot;Miss Taylor was always in the fore to lead the battle against the measure.&quot; She was the president and founder of the California Pet Owners&#x27; Protective League, an organization that focused on finding homes for pets to prevent them from going to local animal shelters. In 1953, Taylor was appointed to the Los Angeles City Animal Regulation Commission, which she served as vice president.

==Death==
Taylor died of cancer at her home in Los Angeles on April 15, 1958, at the age of 63. The Los Angeles City Council adjourned that same day &quot;out of respect to her memory.&quot; Ex-husband Jack Dempsey said, &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry to hear of her death. I didn&#x27;t know she was that ill. We hadn&#x27;t seen each other for about 10 years. She was a wonderful person.&quot; Her funeral was held on April 17 in Pierce Bros. Hollywood Chapel. She was interred at Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery.

She was survived by her mother, Ida &quot;Bertha&quot; Barrett Boylan; her sister, Helen Taylor Clark; and a niece, Frances Iblings. She left an estate of more than $10,000, most of it to her family and $200 for the care and maintenance of her three dogs, which she left to her friend Ella Mae Abrams.

==Legacy==
Taylor was known for her dark features and for the sensuality she brought to the films in which she appeared. Gossip columnist Erskine Johnson considered her &quot;the screen&#x27;s No. 1 girl of the 20s.&quot; For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Estelle Taylor was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1620 Vine Street in Hollywood, California.

==Awards==
* One of &quot;Photoplay&quot;&#x27;s Best Performances of the Month (June 1929) for &quot;Where East Is East&quot;
* One of &quot;Screenland&quot;&#x27;s Ten Best Portrayals of the Month (November 1931) for &quot;Street Scene&quot;

==Film portrayal==
In the 1983 American television biopic &quot;Dempsey&quot;, Estelle Taylor was portrayed by British actress Victoria Tennant.

<text>Howard Victor Chaykin (; born October 7, 1950) is an American comic book artist and writer. Chaykin&#x27;s influences include his one-time employer and mentor, Gil Kane, and the mid-20th century illustrators Robert Fawcett and Al Parker.

==Early life==
Howard Chaykin was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Rosalind Pave and Norman Drucker, who soon separated. Chaykin was initially raised by his grandparents in Staten Island, New York City, until his mother married Leon Chaykin in 1953 and the family moved to East Flatbush and later to 370 Saratoga Avenue, Brownsville, Brooklyn. At 14, Chaykin moved with his now divorced mother to the Kew Gardens section of Queens. He said in 2000 he was raised on welfare after his parents separated and that his absent biological father eventually was declared dead, although Chaykin, as an adult, located him alive. Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;nutty and cruel&quot; adoptive father, whom Chaykin until the 1990s believed was his natural father, encouraged Chaykin&#x27;s interest in drawing and bought him sketchbooks.

He was introduced to comics by his cousin, who gave him a refrigerator box filled with them. He graduated from Jamaica High School at 16, in 1967, and in mid-1968 worked at Zenith Press. He attended Columbia College in Chicago that fall, but left school and returned to New York the following year. Chaykin said that after high school, &quot;I hitchhiked around the country&quot; before becoming, at 19, a &quot;gofer&quot; for the New York City–based comic book artist Gil Kane, whom he would name as his greatest influence.

==Career==

Chaykin&#x27;s earliest work with comic books was under the tutelage of Gil Kane, whom he would later call his mentor.
In 1970, he began publishing his art in comics and science-fiction fanzines, sometimes under the pseudonym Eric Pave. 
Leaving Kane, he began working as an assistant to comics artist Wally Wood in the studio he shared with Syd Shores and Jack Abel in Valley Stream, Long Island. He worked there for a &quot;couple of months&quot;, and in 1971 published his first professional comics work, for the adult-theme Western feature &quot;Shattuck&quot; in the military newspaper the &quot;Overseas Weekly&quot;, one of Wood&#x27;s clients. He also &quot;ghosted some stuff&quot; for Gray Morrow: &quot;I penciled a Man-Thing story he did [for Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Fear&quot; #10 (cover-dated Oct. 1972)], and I penciled a thing for [the magazine] &quot;National Lampoon&quot; called &quot;Michael Rockefeller and the Jungles of New Guinea.&quot; He then apprenticed under Neal Adams, working with the artist at Adams&#x27; home in The Bronx. This led to his first work at DC Comics, one of the two largest comics companies:

The &quot;one-page filler&quot;, titled &quot;Strange Neighbor&quot;, was inventoried and eventually published in the Boltinoff-edited &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #17 (May 1974). His other earliest known DC work was penciling and inking the three-page story &quot;Not Old Enough!&quot; in &quot;Young Romance&quot; #185 (Aug. 1972), and penciling the eight-page supernatural story &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; in &quot;Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion&quot; #7 (Oct. 1972) and the one-page &quot;Enter the Portals of Weird War&quot; in &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #9 (Dec. 1972).

At one point Chaykin lived in the same Queens apartment building as artists Allen Milgrom, Walter Simonson, and Bernie Wrightson. Simonson recalls, &quot;We&#x27;d get together at 3 a.m. They&#x27;d come up and we&#x27;d have popcorn and sit around and talk about whatever a 26, 27, and 20-year-old guys talk about. Our art, TV, you name it. I pretty much knew at the time, &#x27;These are the good ole days.&#x27;&quot;

Chaykin&#x27;s first major work was for DC Comics drawing the 23-page &quot;The Price of Pain Ease&quot;—writer Denny O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s adaptation of author Fritz Leiber&#x27;s characters Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser—in &quot;Sword of Sorcery&quot; #1 (March 1973). Although the title was well received, it lasted only five issues before cancellation. Chaykin drew the character Ironwolf in the science fiction anthology title &quot;Weird Worlds&quot; for DC, and did the pencils and ink for a 12-page Batman story written by Archie Goodwin and published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #441 in 1974. In 2018 he looked back on this Batman story as one of the worst things he had ever drawn, adding, &quot;Anything of value in that story was Archie&#x27;s.&quot; Moving to Marvel Comics, he began work as co-artist with Neal Adams on the first Killraven story, seen in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #18 in 1973.

After this, Chaykin was given various adventure strips to draw for Marvel, including his own creation, Dominic Fortune (inspired by his Scorpion character, originally drawn for Atlas Comics), now in the pages of &quot;Marvel Preview&quot;. In 1978, he wrote and drew his Cody Starbuck creation for the anthology title &quot;Star Reach&quot;, one of the first independent titles of the 1970s. These strips saw him explore more adult themes as best he could within the restrictions often imposed on him by editors and the Comics Code Authority. The same year, he produced for Schanes &amp; Schanes a six-plate portfolio showcasing his character.

In 1976, Chaykin landed the job of drawing the Marvel Comics adaptation of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, written by Roy Thomas. Chaykin left after 10 issues to work in more adult and experimental comics, and to do paperback book covers. 

In late 1978, Chaykin, Walt Simonson, Val Mayerik, and Jim Starlin formed Upstart Associates, a shared studio space on West 29th Street in New York City. The membership of the studio changed over time.

Chaykin penciled DC Comics&#x27; first miniseries, &quot;World of Krypton&quot; (July–September 1979).

In the next few years he produced material for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, drew a graphic novel adaptation of Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, and produced illustrations for works by Roger Zelazny. Chaykin collaborated on two original graphic novels—&quot;The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell&quot; with writer Michael Moorcock, and &quot;Empire&quot; with Samuel R. Delany—and found time to move into film design with work on the movie version of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1980 he designed the album cover of &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;, a concept album about legendary outlaw Jesse James.

Chaykin had a six-issue run on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Micronauts&quot; series, drawing issues from #13 (January 1980) to #18 (June 1980). He went back to Cody Starbuck with a story in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; between May and September 1981, in the same painted art style he&#x27;d used for the Moorcock graphic novel.

In June 1980, a story that he collaborated on with Samuel R. Delany, called &quot;Seven Moons&#x27; Light Casts Complex Shadows&quot; was published in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #2.

In 1983, Chaykin launched &quot;American Flagg!&quot; for First Comics. With Chaykin as both writer and artist, the series was successful for First and proved highly influential, mixing all of Chaykin&#x27;s previous ideas and interests—jazz, pulp adventure, science fiction and sex. Chaykin made wide use of Craftint Duoshade illustration boards, which in the period before computers allowed him to add a shaded texture to the finished art. &quot;American Flagg!&quot; made a huge splash at the 1984 Eagle Awards, the United Kingdom&#x27;s pre-eminent comics awards. Chaykin and &quot;American Flagg!&quot; were nominated for ten awards, eventually winning seven.

After the first 26 issues of &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, Chaykin started work on new projects. Chaykin&#x27;s involvement in his original run of the series was that of writer for 29 issues, interior artist for issues #1–12 and 14–26, and cover artist for issues #1–33. He returned to full art and writing for the &quot;American Flagg! Special&quot; one-shot in 1986. In 1987, a four-issue run was released, then the title was cancelled and relaunched as &quot;Howard Chaykin&#x27;s American Flagg!&quot;, which ran 12 issues.

The first new project was a revamp of &quot;The Shadow&quot; in a four-issue miniseries for DC Comics in 1986. Rather than setting the series in its traditional 1930s milieu, Chaykin updated it to a contemporary setting and included his own style of extreme violence. In a 2012 interview, Chaykin stated, &quot;The reason I pulled him out of the period was because I thought it would be commercial suicide to do a period character at that point.&quot;

The &quot;American Flagg! Special&quot; one-shot introduced Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;Time²&quot;, a two-volume graphic-novel series with a heavy dose of jazz, film noir and a fantasy version of New York City: &quot;Time²: The Epiphany&quot; () and &quot;Time²: The Satisfaction of Black Mariah&quot; ()). In 1987, Chaykin described plans for a third volume, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s probably going to be grossly different from the first two, because I&#x27;m taking things in another direction ... I want to do a story that is both very funny ... and at the same time very, very ugly. Really nasty and unpleasant. Because frankly, it&#x27;s the place to do that sort of thing.&quot; Although Chaykin hoped it would be available in 1988, the third volume will be included in the Time² Omnibus, released in February, 2024 through Image Comics.

Chaykin has described &quot;Time²&quot; as the single work about which he is most proud. &quot;To tell you the truth, my first interest would be to do another &quot;Time²&quot; because that was a very personal product for me,&quot; he said in 2008. &quot;It&#x27;s a fantasia of my family&#x27;s story.&quot;

Before returning to &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, Chaykin revamped another DC Comics character with &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, a three-issue miniseries about a team of heroic aviators, set in the 1930s.

In 1987, DC proposed a system of labeling comics for violent or sexual content, Chaykin with Alan Moore and Frank Miller boycotted DC and refused to work for the company.

In 1988, Chaykin created perhaps his most controversial title: &quot;Black Kiss&quot;, a 12-issue series published by Vortex Comics that contained his most explicit depictions of sex and violence, with a story of sex-obsessed vampires in Hollywood. Though &quot;Black Kiss&quot; shipped sealed in an &quot;adults only&quot; clear plastic bag, its content drew much criticism. This did not stop it from selling well enough for Chaykin to describe it as &quot;probably, on a per-page basis, the most profitable book I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

===1990s===
Chaykin returned to DC to write the three-issue miniseries &quot;Twilight&quot;, drawn by José Luis García-López and revamping some of DC&#x27;s science-fiction heroes of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Tommy Tomorrow and Space Cabby. Later, Chaykin collaborated twice with artist Mike Mignola: In 1990–1991, they produced the &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; miniseries for Epic Comics with co-writer John Francis Moore and inker Al Williamson. This was followed with the &quot;Ironwolf: Fires of the Revolution&quot; graphic novel in 1992. Chaykin then wrote and illustrated &quot;Midnight Men&quot; for Marvel&#x27;s Epic imprint in 1993. He co-created/designed Firearm for Malibu Comics that same year, and then with several colleagues formed the creator-owned &quot;Bravura&quot; imprint for Malibu Comics. Chaykin created the four-issue miniseries &quot;Power and Glory&quot; in 1994, a superhero-themed public relations satire.

In 1996, DC&#x27;s Helix imprint published &quot;Cyberella&quot;, a cyberpunk dystopia written by Chaykin and drawn by Don Cameron.

Chaykin began to drift out of comics by the mid-1990s. With the exception of several &quot;Elseworlds&quot; stories he wrote for DC Comics, including &quot;Batman: Dark Allegiances&quot; which he wrote and drew in 1996, his comic output became minimal as he became more involved in film and television work. He was executive script consultant for the 1990–1991 &quot;The Flash&quot; television series on CBS, and later worked on action-adventure programs such as &quot;Viper&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mutant X&quot;.

Near the end of the decade, Chaykin returned to comics and co-wrote with David Tischman the three-issue miniseries &quot;Pulp Fantastic&quot; for the Vertigo imprint of DC, with art by Rick Burchett.

===2000s===
Chaykin began co-writing &quot;American Century&quot; with David Tischman for Vertigo. This story, set in post-war America, would be a pulp-adventure strip inspired by the likes of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; as well as the EC Comics war stories created by Harvey Kurtzman. That year, Chaykin became part of the creative team on &quot;Mutant X&quot;, a television series inspired by the Marvel Comics series of mutant titles.

His next work was &quot;Mighty Love&quot;, a 96-page original graphic novel published in 2004 and described as &quot;&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; with super-powers&quot;. This was acclaimed as a return to the type of work he did on &quot;American Flagg!&quot; and contained his first art in a title since the early 1990s.

That year, Chaykin and Tischman revamped &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; in a six-issue mini-series for DC, as well as writing a mini-series about gangster vampires called &quot;Bite Club&quot; for Vertigo. The pair wrote &quot;Barnum!: In Secret Service to the USA&quot;, a graphic novel in which real-life showman P. T. Barnum comes to the aid of the U.S. government.

In 2005, Chaykin produced the six-part &quot;City of Tomorrow&quot;, a DC/Wildstorm production involving a futuristic city populated by gangster robots. Chaykin described the mini-series as &quot;&quot;The Untouchables&quot; meets &quot;West World&quot; at Epcot.&quot; That same year, he wrote the four-issue mini-series &quot;Legend&quot; updating the character Hugo Danner for Wildstorm.

He illustrated &quot;24 College Ave.&quot;, a story serialized online in 54 chapters for ESPN.com&#x27;s Page 2 section. ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple wrote the text, each episode of which was accompanied by a single-panel Chaykin drawing.

In 2006, he began working on his first superhero title for DC Comics, pencilling &quot;Hawkgirl&quot;, with Walter Simonson writing, starting with issue #50. With issue 56, he stopped drawing the series, mainly to get time to work on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Blade&quot; with Marc Guggenheim, although he continued to draw &quot;Hawkgirl&quot; covers for eight more issues.

Also in 2006, DC Comics published a two-page Black Canary origin story drawn by Chaykin for the series &quot;52&quot;. Later that year, DC released &quot;Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage&quot;. The two-issue series, written and drawn by Chaykin, revolves around the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; role in an interstellar war.

After &quot;Blade&quot; was cancelled with issue 12, he pencilled issue 50 of &quot;Punisher&quot;, &quot;Wolverine (vol. 3)&quot; #56–61, &quot;Punisher War Journal (vol. 2)&quot; (#16–24) and an issue of &quot;Immortal Iron Fist&quot;. Chaykin illustrated the 2008 Marvel MAX comic &quot;War Is Hell: The First Flight of the Phantom Eagle&quot;, scripted by Garth Ennis. He wrote &quot;Supreme Power&quot; vol. 3 #1–12 (Sep. 2008 – July 2009) for Marvel. In 2009, he wrote and penciled &quot;Dominic Fortune&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2010 he wrote &quot;Die Hard: Year One&quot;, a comic about John McClane from the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series for Boom! Studios. Marvel in June 2010 published a Rawhide Kid miniseries drawn by Chaykin and written by Ron Zimmerman.

Chaykin wrote and drew the &quot;Avengers 1959&quot; five-issue miniseries, a spinoff of a storyline introduced in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;. The first issue was released in October 2011.

Chaykin helmed a reboot of the science-fiction character &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; beginning in August 2013, again in the capacity of both artist and writer.

In 2018, Chaykin began &quot;Hey Kids! Comics!&quot;, a cynical parody of the history of the rise of the comics industry and the many creators exploited in the process (particularly those exploited by Marvel Comics). This Image Comics series was completed in September 2023 after three volumes and 17 total issues.

===2020s===
In April 2022, Chaykin was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Chaykin&#x27;s contribution was a story featuring American Flagg!.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Chaykin married Daina Graziunas. The marriage ended in 1977, and the following year he married Leslie Zahler. That marriage ended in 1986, and in 1989, in Los Angeles, Chaykin married Jeni Munn, a union that lasted through 1992. In November 2002, in Ventura, Chaykin married Laurel Beth Rice.

As of 2013, Chaykin serves on the Disbursement Committee of the comic-book industry charity The Hero Initiative.

<text>Fenix was a Polish science fiction magazine published from 1990 to 2001. It was the first privately owned magazine in the country. It was created by Jarosław Grzędowicz, Krzysztof Sokołowski, Rafał A. Ziemkiewicz, Andrzej Łaski and Dariusz Zientalak jr.

The magazine was reactivated in literary and critical anthology form in 2018 by Bartek Biedrzycki (Polish s-f and comic writer and publisher) and Sokołowski under the name &quot;Fenix Antologia&quot; with official approval from Grzędowicz.

== About ==
Fenix was created as a continuation of &quot;Feniks&quot; fanzine, which ran for 8 issues winning the European SF Awards in 1987 for best zine. The magazine was published at first by Radwan, then since 1991 by Prószyński i Spółka, and from 2000 to 2001 by Wydawnictwo Mag, after which date the publication was suspended until 2018. From the beginning to 1993 Rafał A. Ziemkiewicz was the editor in chief, later on replaced by Jarosław Grzędowicz. The 2018 &quot;Fenix Antologia&quot; run is edited by Bartek Biedrzycki.

The magazine was visually distinct due to its small,&quot;pocket&quot; size, also recalled as easy to carry in the side pockets of military trousers. Together with the Fantastyka magazine, &quot;Fenix&quot; is said to have created and shaped a whole generation of Polish s-f and fantasy writers in Poland in the 90&#x27;s as well as introducing some of the great names from the western SF&amp;F literature.

<doc id="1176062" wikidata="Q20001765" url="?curid=1176062" title="Emine">
<text>Emine is an Arabic-origin given name used for females in Turkey. It has three major meanings: (1) one in whom you can trust and believe, (2) one who is benign and innocuous, and (3) one who is fearless and courageous. It is also argued that the word means beautiful. The name is also used in Japanese (えみね), often with the kanji 笑音 meaning &quot;smiling sound&quot;.

==Origins and variants==
The origin of &quot;Emine&quot; is Arabic, but its source word has not been clearly established, and two accounts are given. It may be either the feminine form of &quot;Emin&quot; or a derivative of the African, Arabic, English, and Swahili name Amina. Emmie is considered to be the Western version of the name.

The name of a sixth-century Leinster-based Irish cleric was &quot;Émíne&quot;. &quot;Emine&quot; was also the given name of the Roman emperor&#x27;s daughter who was the lover of the Sultan of Babylon in Thomas Lodge&#x27;s historical romance &quot;The History of Robert, Second Duke of Normandy&quot;. The name was one of the 16th century Ottoman feminine names recorded in Istanbul.

==Other usages==
The word &quot;Emine&quot; has also been used for geographical areas and places. A headland at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast is called Cape Emine. In addition, there is &quot;Emine Mountain&quot; or &quot;Emine Dagh&quot; in Stara planina in Bulgaria. The other related geographical term is &quot;Emine Balkan&quot;, which was used by the Bulgarians instead of &quot;Rumeli&quot; (Roman country) to refer to the territory of Bulgaria where some Turkish tribes had lived since the 11th century. Here, the word is derived not from Arabic, but from Greek (&quot;Haemus&quot;: Αἵμον [acc.]), where it is, in turn, a derivative of *Ἔμμωνα, &quot;Emona&quot;, discovered in documents of the early 14th century. However, Maria Todorova claims that &quot;Emine Balkan&quot; is the literal Ottoman translation of &quot;Haemus mountain&quot; and that the term was also employed by the Ottomans who derived the word &quot;Emine&quot; from the Byzantine words &quot;Aimos&quot;, &quot;Emmon&quot;, and &quot;Emmona&quot;. In Ijevan, Armenia, a quarters is called &quot;Emine kışlağı&quot;.

In the 16th century Ottoman Empire, &quot;emine&quot; was the term used for export tax.

<text>The Blockade of Africa began in 1808 after the United Kingdom outlawed the Atlantic slave trade, making it illegal for British ships to transport slaves. The Royal Navy immediately established a presence off Africa to enforce the ban, called the West Africa Squadron. Although the ban initially applied only to British ships, Britain negotiated treaties with other countries to give the Royal Navy the right to intercept and search their ships for slaves.

The 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves abolished the intercontinental slave trade in the United States but was not widely enforced. From 1819, some effort was made by the United States Navy to prevent the slave trade. This mostly consisted of patrols of the shores of the Americas and in the mid-Atlantic, the latter being largely unsuccessful due to the difficulty of intercepting ships mid-ocean. As part of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842, it was agreed that both countries would work together on the abolition of the slave trade, which was deemed piracy, and to continue the blockade of Africa. US Navy involvement continued until the beginning of the American Civil War, in 1861. The following year, the Lincoln administration gave the UK full authority to intercept US ships. Slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865, when Congress ratified the 13th Amendment. The Royal Navy squadron remained in operation until 1870.

==United Kingdom involvement==
===Background===
The Slave Trade Act 1807 stated that:

The African Slave Trade, and all manner of dealing and trading in the Purchase, Sale, Barter, or Transfer of Slaves, or of Persons intended to be sold, transferred, used, or dealt with as Slaves, practised or carried on, in, at, to or from any Part of the Coast or Countries of Africa, shall be, and the same is hereby utterly abolished, prohibited, and declared to be unlawful.

Under this act, if a ship was caught with slaves, there was a fine of £100 per enslaved person. This fine was usually paid by the ship&#x27;s captain.

In order to enforce this, two ships were dispatched to the African coast, their primary mission being to prevent British subjects from slave trading and also to disrupt the slave trades of the UK&#x27;s enemies during the Napoleonic Wars.

===Diplomacy===
The original 1807 Act only allowed for British ships to be searched and applied only to British subjects. The slave trade on the African coast therefore continued, though without the presence of British slavers, at least on a legal basis. However, in 1810, under considerable diplomatic pressure, a convention with Portugal was signed, widening the mandate of the Royal Navy. In 1815, Portugal strengthened their anti-slavery legislation by abolishing all trade north of the equator, allowing the Royal Navy a much freer hand. With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, Britain obtained treaties with several other powers, including France, which abolished its trade entirely in 1815 (but did not commit to right of search), and Spain, which agreed to cease trade north of the equator in 1818, and south of the equator by 1820. A clause was also inserted into the Congress of Vienna, which called for the eventual abolition of the trade by all signatories. In 1826, Brazil signed an agreement similar to that of Portugal and ceased trade north of the equator.

The UK&#x27;s slave trade suppression efforts attempted to remain within the primitive international laws of the time: slavers had to be tried in courts. British vessels were taken to vice admiralty courts, and those of foreign states that had treaties with the UK were taken to Courts of Mixed Commission. Mixed Commission Courts had representation from both the UK and the other nation in question, to ensure a fair trial. Many were established at key points along the coast of Africa and its islands. However, the reluctance of other powers greatly curtailed the ability of the courts to operate. Sometimes, the foreign representation would never arrive, or arrive exceptionally late. The Brazilian ambassador, in spite of the court opening in 1826, did not arrive until 1828, and he reversed all judgements carried out in his absence upon arrival.

In addition to the issues with Mixed Commission Courts, the Navy&#x27;s mandate to police the trade was also found to be lacking and built on a series of complicated and often weak diplomatic treaties between other states. The agreements were signed reluctantly and were therefore very weak in practice. When policing foreign vessels, there had to be slaves on board at the time of seizure for the accused slaver to be convicted. Unlike in Britain&#x27;s 1807 Act, there was no equipment clause, meaning that slave ships carrying what was obviously equipment for transporting slaves, but without slaves on board at the time of search, could not be seized. This major flaw, which greatly curtailed the navy&#x27;s efforts and caused some naval officers to fall foul of the law, was not rectified until the 1830s. Frustrated with the lack of progress, in 1839, the British government subjected Portuguese vessels to British jurisdiction and did the same to Brazilian vessels in 1845. This was an unprecedented step, which subjected foreign vessels to the much more stringent British law and much stricter penalties for slave trading.

However, some nations, such as the United States, resisted British coercion. The US believed strongly in freedom of the seas and on several occasions refused to allow the Royal Navy right of search. Knowing that many slavers would fly false US flags to avoid being boarded, some slavers were even registered in southern US states. This caused several diplomatic incidents, as frustrated officers would often board ships with US flags, directly contravening their orders, to capture slavers. There was fierce opposition to this in the US Congress, and John Forsyth said in 1841 that &quot;the persistence&quot; of British cruisers was &quot;unwarranted&quot;, &quot;destructive to private interests&quot;, and &quot;[would] inevitably destroy the harmony of the two countries&quot;. In 1842, there was a thaw in diplomatic relations, and the US allowed visitation to US vessels, but only if a US officer was also present.

With the beginning of the 1850s, Portugal had completely ceased slave trading (1836) and Spain had all but ceased, but Cuba was still an active slave port. Brazil continued to defy British intervention, and the Brazilian trade was not extinguished until 1852, when Palmerston began using force under the &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; doctrine.

===West Africa Squadron===


The British Royal Navy commissioned the West Africa Squadron in 1807, and the United States Navy did so as well in 1842. The squadron had the duty to protect Africa from slave traders, and it effectively aided in ending the transatlantic slave trade. In addition to the West Africa Squadron, the Africa Squadron had the same duties to perform. However, they faced a problem with finding enough sailors. The Liberian coastal Kru people were hired, which allowed the West African Squadron to patrol the coast of Africa effectively. Following the 1807 Act, two ships had been dispatched to the African coast for anti-slavery patrol.

By 1818, the squadron had grown to six ships, with a naval station established in 1819 at what is now Freetown and a supply base at Ascension Island, later moved to Cape Town in 1832.

These resources were further increased: in the middle of the 19th century, there were around 25 vessels and 2,000 personnel, with a further 1,000 local sailors. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans. Around 2,000 British sailors died on their mission of freeing slaves with the West Africa Squadron.

===End of the trade===
In spite of Britain&#x27;s best efforts to pursue suppression through diplomatic means, the trade persisted. Public opinion was beginning to turn against the anti-slavery efforts due to their huge costs, the diplomatic repercussions they created, and the damage caused to other trade. Opposition in the Commons emerged from anti-coercionists, who were opposed to the use of British coercion of other nations and prolonged military action against slavers. The anti-coercionists were a mixed group of free trade activists and anti-slavery advocates who saw the only way to end the trade being the establishment of legitimate commerce with Africa. Their leader, Thomas Fowell Buxton, advocated a renewed naval effort until this could be achieved. In 1839, he published &quot;The African Slave Trade and its Remedy&quot;, which contained a top-to-bottom critique of the British efforts thus far. The work was highly influential and gave Buxton a leading role in the planning of the Niger expedition of 1841, an attempt to establish trading posts along the Niger River to create an alternative to slave trading. Although the plan had offered a long-term solution to the slave trade, the expedition ended in abject failure, with many of the Europeans falling ill. In 1845, Buxton died, with his ambitions unfulfilled.

From 1845, the anti-coercionist cause became much more radical and much less concerned with the plight of Africans; this &quot;new generation&quot; of anti-coercionists did not include abolitionists. Free trade advocates such as William Hutt were vehemently opposed to naval actions and argued the trade would eventually die naturally and the UK&#x27;s interference was unwarranted. Such was their influence that there was even a motion in the Commons to end all naval activity, which came close to ending the West Africa Squadron and also the career of Prime Minister John Russell, who threatened resignation should the motion be carried.

To prevent a repeat of this, swift action was taken. Brazil was still one of the largest slave trading nations and continued to defy British diplomatic calls to put an end to the practice. In 1846, Palmerston returned as foreign secretary and in 1850 permitted Royal Naval vessels to enter Brazilian waters in order to blockade slavers on both sides of the Atlantic. By 1852, the Brazilian trade could be said to be extinct. &quot;For Palmerston … the naval campaign on the coast of Brazil had brought the long drawn-out saga of the Brazilian slave trade to a resolution within twelve months&quot;.

The many years of British pressure on the United States to join vigorously in fighting the Atlantic slave trade had been neutralised by the southern states. However, with the onset of the American Civil War, the Lincoln administration became eager to sign up, humanitarian and military objectives combined. To the North, anti-slavery was an important military tool with which to harm the Confederate economy. It also won praise, sympathy, and support on the international stage and dampened international support for the Southern States, who vehemently defended their right to keep slaves. In the Lyons–Seward Treaty of 1862, the United States gave the UK full authority to crack down on the Atlantic slave trade when carried on by US ships. With the end of hostilities the UK and the US would continue cooperating, and in 1867, Cuba, under much pressure from the two nations, gave up its trade.

==United States involvement==

The United States Constitution of 1787 had protected the importation of slaves for twenty years. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society held its first meeting at the temporary capital, Philadelphia, in 1794. On 7 April 1798, the fifth Congress passed an act that imposed a $300-per-slave penalty on persons convicted of performing the illegal importation of slaves. It was an indication of the type of behaviour and course of events soon to become commonplace in the Congress.

On Thursday, 12 December 1805, in the ninth Congress, Senator Stephen Roe Bradley of the State of Vermont gave notice that he should, on Monday next, move for leave to bring in a bill to prohibit the importation of &quot;certain persons&quot; therein described &quot;into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January&quot;, which will be &quot;in the year of our Lord 1808&quot;. His words would be repeated many times by the legislators in the ninth Congress. The &quot;certain persons&quot; were described as being slaves on Monday, 16 December 1805.

Wary of offending slaveholders to the least degree, the Senate amended the proposed Senatorial Act, then passed it to the House of Representatives, where it was meticulously scrutinised. Ever mindful of not inciting the wrath of slaveholders, members of the House produced a bill that would explain the Senatorial Act. The two measures were bound together, with the House bill being called &quot;H R 77&quot; and the Senate Act being called &quot;An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, 1808&quot;. The bond measure also regulated the coastwise slave trade. The bond measure was placed before President Thomas Jefferson on 2 March 1807 for his approbation.

The 1807 Act of Congress was modified and supplemented by the Fifteenth Congress. The importation of slaves into the United States was called &quot;piracy&quot; by an Act of Congress that punctuated the Era of Good Feelings in 1819. Any citizen of the United States found guilty of such &quot;piracy&quot; might be given the death penalty. The role of the Navy was expanded to include patrols off the coasts of Cuba and South America. The naval activities in the western Atlantic bore the name of &quot;The African Slave Trade Patrol of 1820–61&quot;. The &quot;blockade of Africa&quot; was still being performed in the eastern Atlantic at the same time.

===Africa Squadron operations===
American naval officer Matthew Calbraith Perry was the executive officer aboard in 1819, which had escorted the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, whose passengers included former slaves moving from the United States to Africa. President James Monroe had the Secretary of the Navy order the American vessel to convoy the &quot;Elizabeth&quot; to Africa with the first contingent of freed slaves that the American Colonization Society was resettling there. Of the 86 black emigrants sailing on the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, only about one-third were men; the rest were women and children. In 1821, Perry commanded in the Africa Squadron. , under the command of Lieutenant Robert F. Stockton, was also in the African Squadron in 1821 and captured several slavers. Lieutenant Stockton also convinced the local African chief to relinquish land around Cape Mesurado, where Liberia eventually formed. Stockton became the commander of the US Navy&#x27;s first screw-propelled steamer, , in 1843.

On 26 and 27 November 1842, aboard in the African Squadron, commander Alexander Slidell Mackenzie ordered the arrest of three crewmen who were plotting to take control of the ship. The three were hanged on 1 December. This is the only occurrence of maritime mutiny at law in the history of the United States Navy.

Commodore Perry was placed in command of the African Squadron in 1843. Ships that captured slavers while deployed with the African Squadron include , , and the second , which captured &quot;Cora&quot; on 26 September 1860, with 705 Africans on board. The first captured the brig &quot;Storm King&quot; on 8 August 1860, off the mouth of the Congo River, with 619 Africans on board. In her final act, captured &quot;H.N. Gambrill&quot; in 1853.

The Navy attempted to intercept slave ships from 1808 (or 1809) to 1866. A small number of ships were accosted; some of them were carrying Africans destined to be sold into slavery, while others, which had no slaves on board, were captured and escorted away from the coast of Africa.

===Black Ivory===
The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 created great demand for more slaves to work in the vast new area. Jean Lafitte was a pirate who brought many slaves to the United States and sold them through an organised system established at New Orleans that included merchants from the vicinity. After he helped Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812, President James Madison issued a proclamation early in 1815 granting him and his men pardons for their misdeeds.

The United States Navy&#x27;s Africa Squadron, Brazil Squadron, and Home Squadron were assigned the task of intercepting ships that were bringing Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the slave markets, where &quot;black ivory&quot; found numerous customers. Since the War of Independence had been costly, no American warships were constructed between 1783 and 1795. The Navy Department was created on 30 April 1798. On 27 March 1794, following communication with President Washington, Congress authorised the purchase or construction of six frigates. These ships included the first USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, launched 7 September 1797, and USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, a ship that would be briefly employed in the African Squadron. Few new ships were built in the United States after 1801 until USS &quot;Guerriere&quot; was launched on 20 June 1814; it proved to be an effective warship in the war with the Barbary pirates in 1815.

At the same time as this effort was taking place, other important tasks, such as the War of 1812, the ongoing troubles with the Barbary pirates, the extermination of the pirates in the West Indies from 1819 to 1827, the protection of American shipping in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru in the 1830s, the War with Mexico in the 1840s, the voyages to Japan in the 1850s, and transporting of diplomats to other nations left little capability available for use in the African Squadron.

<doc id="1176090" wikidata="Q726986" url="?curid=1176090" title="Mamberamo River">
<text>The Mamberamo (&quot;Indonesian: Sungai Mamberamo&quot;) is the second-longest river on the island of New Guinea, after Sepik River (1,126 km) and the second largest in Oceania by discharge volume after Fly. It is located in the Indonesian province of Papua. It is the second largest river in Indonesia by volume of discharge after Kapuas and also the widest.

The river is formed from the confluence of its upper tributaries, the Tariku and Taritatu Rivers in the Lakes Plains region, an interior basin with extensive freshwater swamp forests and grasslands. It flows northwards between the &quot;Van Rees Range&quot; (&quot;Pegunungan Van Rees&quot;) and Foja Mountains through a series of rapids and gorges. The last 160 km of the river are navigable. In the coastal lowlands, the river is lined with marshes and forms a broad river delta. The Mamberamo discharges into the Pacific Ocean at the northern point of Point D&#x27;Urville or Cape Narwaku (&quot;Tanjung Narwaku&quot;).

The river&#x27;s huge valley is home to various uncontacted peoples and incredible biodiversity. In the 1990s, the Indonesian Government had plans to construct a large hydroelectric dam on the Mamberamo that would have submerged much of the area. This plan was shelved after the Indonesian financial crisis from 1998 to 1999, but there are concerns by environmental groups that it could be resurrected sometime in the future. At present, the Mamberamo remains the second largest river in the world to be completely unfragmented by dams in its catchment, behind only the relatively nearby Fly.

The Mamberamo area also broadly refers to several nearby mountain ranges, including the Van Rees and Foja Mountains (also known as Foya), which were the subject of a recent rapid biological assessment conducted by Conservation International, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, and Cenderawasih University. The scientific team discovered the first new bird species from New Guinea in 60 years, and a wealth of other new plants and animals. The Foya Mountains appear to be a globally outstanding repository of biodiversity.

==Hydrology==
Its length from the confluence of the Tariku and Taritatu is . From the source of the Waruta, it covers a total distance of . It has a catchment area of with an annual rainfall of 3,578 mm (Köppen climate classification classifies this area as type &quot;Af&quot;). Average width is , depth (maximum 33 m).

==Tributaries==

The main tributaries from the mouth:

==Discharge==
Average monthly flow (Q) at delta in 2003–2012: 5,014 m3/s (158.23 km3/year)
Mamberamo River average discharge:
==Geology==
The region is geologically young (middle to late Miocene, i.e. less than 15 million years old) and remains tectonically active, with frequent earthquakes and landslides in the steepest areas. The mountain basin called &quot;Mamberamo&quot; is composed mostly of high floodplains, extensive swamps, forested wetlands, meandering rivers and backwater lakes. The sediment-rich rivers in the catchment belong to &#x27;white-water&#x27; systems similar to the Amazonian moors. Three soil orders are present, of which the inceptisols are the most widespread, followed by ultisols and entisols. All soils are fine textured with poor drainage. The diversity of the region is a result of its geological history, which gives rise to a diversity of habitats. Riparian forests within the Mamberamo Basin are heavily influenced by dynamic river meanders that continually modify the landscape, with some banks eroding rapidly while others grow as new sediments accumulate. 
==Ecology and vegetation==
The &quot;Mamberamo Basin&quot; is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in New Guinea. Both &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;Australo-Pacific&quot; elements are present in terms of botanical affinities. One survey at the foothills of the Foja Mountains identified 487 putative plant species, 156 of which are not assigned to known taxa, indicating a high proportion of undescribed species. The floodplain forests of the basin include swamp forests, seasonally flooded lakeside forests and sago forests.

Seven general vegetation categories are distinguished in the landscape: primeval forest (old-growth dryland forest), swamp forest (natural wetlands dominated by trees), &quot;lakeside forest&quot; (seasonally flooded forest), sago forest (a form of swamp) dominated by sago palm, secondary forest, mixed forest and sago woodland. Two other types are also recognised: montane forest and &quot;damar forest&quot;.The region has a low population density. The majority of people live from subsistence activities: hunting, fishing and small-scale agriculture. Trades include crocodile skins, dried fish and gaharu. Mixed crop gardens are located near the dwelling or on the river banks and are mostly planted with sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) and manioc (Manihot utilissima). In these gardens, people plant bananas (Musa), coconuts (Cocos nucifera) and various vegetables.

Crocodiles are common in the rivers (typically two species: freshwater and saltwater, Crocodylus novaeguineae and Crocodylus porosus). The globally endangered Scott&#x27;s kangaroo (Dendrolagus scottae) is thought to occur in the Foja Mountains, while the northern cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus), Victoria-crowned dove (Goura victoria) and black-spotted couscous (Spilocuscus rufoniger) form significant populations. Local endemic species include Philemon brassi, Amblyornis flavifrons, the Salvadoran fig parrot (Psittaculirostris salvadorii), and a number of frog, invertebrate and plant species. More than 70 new species have been reported. Noteworthy vertebrates include the rediscovery of the endemic Berlepsch&#x27;s bird of paradise. As well as several new species, including the honeyeater (Melipotes carolae), the pigeon (Duculas), the dwarf opossum (Cercartetus), the giant rat (Mallomys), a Dorcopsulus and a bow-fingered gecko (Cyrtodactylus).

==History==

In 1545, the Spanish navigator Iñigo Ortiz de Retes sailed along the northern coast of the island as far as the mouth of this river that he charted as &quot;San Agustín&quot;. At this spot, on 20 June 1545, he claimed the territory for the Spanish Crown, and in the process bestowed the name to the island (&quot;Nueva Guinea&quot;) by which it is known today.

The first European to enter the mouth of the Mamberamo was Dutchman Dr D. F. van Braam Morris in 1883. The residents from the northern Moluccas (Ternate) rowed up the river to ascertain that it was navigable by steamer. The following year in 1884 Van Braam Morris returned to the steamship &quot;Havik&quot; and travelled (as the crow flies) along its course.

==Mamberamo Foja Wildlife Reserve==

The Mamberamo Foja Wildlife Reserve covers an area of 16,610 km2, extending along the Mamberamo and its major tributaries from the Central Range foothills to the Pacific Ocean. It encompasses the central Lakes Plains region and extends southwards along the eastern side of the river to include the Foya Mountains, the river delta, and the sea.

==Mamberamo Bridge==
The Mamberamo Bridge was the second longest cable-stayed span in Indonesia after Kutai Kartanegara Bridge with 235 meters and 270 meters respectively until the latter bridge collapsed in November 2011.

<text>Star Reach (also spelled Star*Reach) was an American science fiction and fantasy comics anthology published from 1974 to 1979 by Mike Friedrich.

==Publication history==
One of the first American mainstream independent comic books, &quot;Star*Reach&quot; bridged the gap between the countercultural underground comics and traditional Marvel/DC Comics fare, providing mature genre stories for an adult audience. The fan press of the time referred to this and the comics magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; as &quot;ground-level publications&quot;. Along with such other examples as Flo Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot;, published in 1975, and Harvey Pekar&#x27;s naturalistic everyman series &quot;American Splendor&quot;, first published in 1976, &quot;Star*Reach&quot; was a forerunner of the late-1970s rise of the modern graphic novel, and of the 1980s&#x27; independent comics.
Eighteen issues were released between 1974 and 1979. Contributors included such Marvel and DC writers and artists as Howard Chaykin, Jim Starlin, and Barry Windsor-Smith. It also included prose short stories by such authors as Roger Zelazny, who wrote the 13-page &quot;The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth&quot;, with illustrations by Gray Morrow, in issue #12 (March 1978).

Friedrich&#x27;s company grew into a small publishing house in Hayward, California, also called Star*Reach, that published the comic book series &quot;Quack&quot;; &quot;Imagine&quot;; and Lee Marrs&#x27; &quot;Pudge, Girl Blimp&quot;, along with a number of one-shot comics. The company ceased publishing in 1979.

Eclipse Comics repackaged some of the original &quot;Star*Reach&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot; material as &quot;Star*Reach Classics&quot; in 1984.

<text>Bernard J. Baars (born 1946 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands) is a former Senior Fellow in Theoretical Neurobiology at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, US. He is currently an Affiliated Fellow there.

He is best known as the originator of the global workspace theory, a concept of human cognitive architecture and consciousness. He previously served as a professor of psychology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, where he conducted research into the causation of human errors and the Freudian slip, and as a faculty member at the Wright Institute.

Baars co-founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness and the Academic Press journal &quot;Consciousness and Cognition&quot;, which he also edited, with William P. Banks, for &quot;more than fifteen years&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; was one of five ships of the &quot;Bristol&quot; sub-class of the light cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. Completed in 1910, the ship was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before she was assigned to patrol the coast of South America. Shortly after the start of the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Glasgow&quot; captured a German merchant ship. She spent the next several months searching for German commerce raiders. The ship was then ordered to join Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock&#x27;s squadron in their search for the German East Asia Squadron. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile in the Battle of Coronel. They outnumbered Cradock&#x27;s force and were individually more powerful, sinking Cradock&#x27;s two armoured cruisers, although &quot;Glasgow&quot; was only lightly damaged.

The ship fell back to the coast of Brazil for repairs and to await reinforcements. They arrived in late November under the command of Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee and were considerably more powerful than the East Asia Squadron. After sailing to the Falkland Islands to refuel in early December, the British ships were surprised by the Germans who withdrew when they realized the number of ships that Sturdee had under his command. They pursued the retreating Germans and sank four of their five ships in the Battle of the Falkland Islands, with &quot;Glasgow&quot; helping to sink one of the German light cruisers. She was one of the ships tasked to hunt down the sole survivor which she finally did, together with another cruiser, in the Battle of Más a Tierra in March 1915.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; spent the next two years searching for commerce raiders and protecting Allied shipping off the South American coast, although she was unsuccessful in locating one commerce raider active in the South Atlantic in early 1916. The ship was transferred to the Adriatic Sea in mid-1918 and played a minor role in the Second Battle of Durazzo a few months later. She was reduced to reserve after the war ended, but later served as a training ship in 1922–1926 before she was sold for scrap in 1927.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Bristol&quot; sub-class were officially rated as second-class cruisers suitable for a variety of roles including both trade protection and duties with the fleet. They were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and at deep load. Twelve Yarrow boilers fed &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s Parsons steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts, that were rated at , for a design speed of . The ship reached during her sea trials from . The boilers used both fuel oil and coal, with of coal and tons of oil carried, which gave a range of at . The ship had a crew of 480 officers and ratings.

The main armament of the &quot;Bristol&quot;s was two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch (102 mm) Mk VII guns on single mountings amidships, five on each broadside. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. The ships carried four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns, while they were also equipped with two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. This armament was considered too light for ships of this size, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.

The &quot;Bristol&quot;s were considered protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships&#x27; vitals. The deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by 6 inches of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists. As the protective deck was at waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms. One problem with the armour of the &quot;Bristols&quot; which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, giving large numbers of leg injuries in the ships&#x27; gun crews.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Glasgow&quot;, the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was laid down on 25 March 1909 by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in their Govan shipyard. She was launched on 30 September and completed on 19 September 1910, under the command of Captain Marcus Hill. The ship was initially assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet, but was transferred to the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the south east coast of South America the following year. Hill was relieved by Captain John Luce on 17 September 1912. From March to August, Glasgow cruised the coasts of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, making many port visits.

When the First World War began on 3 August 1914, she was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and captured the Hamburg Süd cargo ship on 14 August. A week later &quot;Glasgow&quot; rendezvoused with the armoured cruiser at the Abrolhos Rocks. The ship continued to patrol and met up with armed merchant cruiser on 28 August and then Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock&#x27;s flagship, the armoured cruiser , on 17 September off Santa Catarina Island. The squadron then proceeded to Montevideo, Uruguay. After coaling the squadron arrived at Punta Arenas, Chile, in the Strait of Magellan, on the 28th. They spent a day searching the area for any German ships before heading to the Falkland Islands where they arrived on 1 October. The squadron coaled there and then &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Monmouth&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; returned to the Tierra del Fuego area on another unsuccessful search for German ships. They proceeded to search up the southern coast of Chile as far as Vallenar. &quot;Good Hope&quot; joined them there on 27 October.

===Battle of Coronel===
The squadron departed two days later, just as the elderly battleship arrived, Cradock ordering her to follow as soon as possible. He sent &quot;Glasgow&quot; to scout ahead and to enter Coronel, Chile to pick up any messages from the Admiralty and acquire intelligence regarding German activities. The cruiser began to pick up radio signals from the light cruiser on the afternoon of 29 October and delayed entering Coronel for two days with Cradock&#x27;s permission to avoid being trapped by the fast German ships. A German supply ship was already there and radioed Spee that &quot;Glasgow&quot; had entered the harbour around twilight. The cruiser departed on the morning of 1 November, but Spee had already made plans to catch her when informed of her presence the previous evening.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; departed Coronel at 09:15 after having picked up the squadron&#x27;s mail and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron four hours later. Cradock ordered his ships to form line abreast with a distance of between ships to maximise visibility at 13:50 and steered north at a speed of . At 16:17 &quot;Leipzig&quot; spotted &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the easternmost British ship, to its west and she spotted &quot;Leipzig&quot;″s funnel smoke three minutes later. At 17:10 Cradock ordered his ships to head for &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the closest ship to the Germans. Once gathered together, he formed them into line astern, with &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the lead, steering south-easterly at at 18:18. As the sixteen guns aboard the armoured cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and were only matched by the two guns on his flagship, he needed to close the range to bring his more numerous 6-inch guns to bear. The Force 7 winds and high seas, however, prevented the use of half of those guns as they were too close to the water. He also wanted to use the setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind the German gunners. (Vice-Admiral) Maximilian von Spee, commander of the East Asia Squadron, was well aware of the British advantages and refused to allow Cradock to close the range. His ships were faster than the British, slowed by the maximum speed of &quot;Otranto&quot;, and he opened up the range to until conditions changed to suit him. The sun set at 18:50, which silhouetted the British ships against the light sky while the German ships became indistinguishable from the shoreline behind them.

Spee immediately turned to close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04, when the range closed to . Spee&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, engaged &quot;Good Hope&quot; while &quot;Gneisenau&quot; fired at &quot;Monmouth&quot;. The German shooting was very accurate, with both armoured cruisers quickly scoring hits on their British counterparts while still outside six-inch gun range, starting fires on both ships. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee&#x27;s ships inflicted. After disabling &quot;Monmouth&quot; around 19:35, Spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on &quot;Good Hope&quot; when she continued to try to close the range. About 19:50 her forward magazine exploded and blew off her bow; she sank not long afterwards.
&quot;Glasgow&quot; fought almost an entirely separate battle as the German armoured cruisers generally ignored her and she inconclusively duelled the light cruisers &quot;Leipzig&quot; and . &quot;Glasgow&quot; broke contact with the German squadron at 20:05 and discovered &quot;Monmouth&quot;, listing and down by the bow, having extinguished her fires, 10 minutes later. She was trying to turn north to put her stern to the heavy northerly swell and was taking water at the bow. There was little that &quot;Glasgow&quot; could do to assist the larger ship as the moonlight illuminated both ships and the Germans were searching for them. He broke contact with her at 20:50 and was finally able to report to &quot;Canopus&quot; the results of the battle. Around 21:20, the ship&#x27;s crew spotted a searchlight beam and gun flashes behind them and knew that the Germans had finished off &quot;Monmouth&quot;. Considering that an estimated 600 shells were fired at her, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was only lightly damaged by five hits, of which the most serious was a shell that detonated on the waterline and tore a hole about in size that flooded one compartment. The ship&#x27;s casualties numbered four lightly wounded ratings and some parrots that the crew had purchased. In return, she failed to hit any of the German ships.

===Battle of the Falkland Islands===
&quot;Glasgow&quot; passed through the Strait of Magellan on 4 November and awaited &quot;Canopus&quot; at its eastern entrance. The battleship rendezvoused with her two days later and they steamed for Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands together. After arriving on the 8th, &quot;Canopus&quot; was ordered to ground herself in the harbour while the light cruiser continued north and met the armoured cruiser at the River Plate and they sailed to Abrolhas Rocks to await reinforcements. &quot;Glasgow&quot; stopped in Rio de Janeiro for repairs 16–21 November and arrived at the rocks two days later where &quot;Defence&quot;, the armoured cruisers , and and the armed merchant cruiser awaited her. &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s sister ship arrived the following day and the battlecruisers and , under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee reached the rocks on 26th. He planned to remain there for three days but was persuaded by Luce to depart on the morning of the 28th.

Upon arrival at Port Stanley on 7 December, Sturdee informed his captains that he planned to recoal the entire squadron the following day from the two available colliers and to begin the search for the East Asia Squadron, believed to be running for home around the tip of South America, the day after. Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee&#x27;s ships by surprise; the observation post telephoned &quot;Canopus&quot; with the information, but the battleship could not see Sturdee&#x27;s flagship to relay the information, only &quot;Glasgow&quot;. &quot;Canopus&quot; hoisted the signal &quot;Enemy in sight&quot; and the light cruiser repeated the message at 07:56, but &quot;Invincible&quot;″s crew was busy loading coal and did not spot the signal. Luce ordered a saluting gun fired to focus attention on the signal. &quot;Glasgow&quot; had completed coaling at 08:00 but needed time to finish raising steam.

The Germans were driven off by shells fired by &quot;Canopus&quot; when they came within range around 09:20. &quot;Glasgow&quot; cleared the harbour by 09:45 and was ordered by Sturdee to trail Spee&#x27;s ships, keeping out of range, and to inform him of their actions. The last of the British ships left the harbor by 10:30 and Sturdee ordered &quot;General chase&quot;. The battlecruisers were the fastest ships present and inexorably began to close on the German ships. They opened fire at 12:55 and started near-missing &quot;Leipzig&quot;, the rear ship in the German formation, 15 minutes later. It was clear to Spee that his ships could not outrun the battlecruisers and that the only hope for any of his ships to survive was to scatter. So he turned his two armoured cruisers around to buy time by engaging the battlecruisers and ordered his three light cruisers to disperse at 13:20. As soon as Luce spotted the light cruisers turn away, he turned to pursue them, followed by &quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Cornwall&quot;.
&quot;Glasgow&quot;, the fastest of the British ships, slowly increased her lead over the two armoured cruisers and Luce opened fire on &quot;Leipzig&quot; with his forward six-inch gun at 14:45 at a range of about . One of his shells struck the German ship and she turned to allow her broadside guns to fire back. The first salvo narrowly missed &quot;Glasgow&quot; and she was hit twice in the next salvo, forcing Luce to fall back. This was repeated several times which allowed the two armoured cruisers to make up some of the distance. An hour later, the Germans scattered in different directions; &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; pursued &quot;Leipzig&quot; while &quot;Kent&quot; went after . &quot;Cornwall&quot; closed on the German ship at full speed, trusting to her armour to keep out the shells, while the unarmoured &quot;Glasgow&quot; manoeuvred at a distance. At 18:00 and &quot;Cornwall&quot;″s shells set &quot;Leipzig&quot; on fire. Five minutes later, the German ship had ceased firing and the British ships closed to to see if she would surrender. One last gun fired, and &quot;Leipzig&quot; did not strike her colours so the British fired several additional salvos at 19:25. The German captain had mustered his surviving crewmen on deck preparatory to abandoning ship, but the ship&#x27;s flag could not be reached because it was surrounded by flames, and the British shells wrought havoc on the assembled crew. &quot;Leipzig&quot; fired two green flares at 20:12 and the British ships closed to within and lowered boats to rescue the Germans at 20:45. Their ship capsized at 21:32 but only a total of 18 men were rescued in the darkness. &quot;Leipzig&quot; had hit &quot;Glasgow&quot; twice, killing a single man and wounding four. The two ships returned to Port Stanley as &quot;Cornwall&quot; had exhausted her ammunition.

===Battle of Más a Tierra===
Sturdee&#x27;s ships continued to search for &quot;Dresden&quot; even after he returned to England. The German cruiser successfully evaded the searching British for months by hiding in the maze of bays and channels surrounding Tierra del Fuego. She began moving up the Chilean coast in February 1915 until she was unexpectedly spotted by &quot;Kent&quot; on 8 March when a fog burned off. The British cruiser tried to close the distance, but &quot;Dresden&quot; managed to break contact after a five-hour chase. &quot;Kent&quot;, however, intercepted a message during the pursuit from &quot;Dresden&quot; to one of her colliers to meet her at Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan Fernández Islands. &quot;Dresden&quot; arrived there the next day, virtually out of coal.
International law allowed the German ship a stay of 24 hours before she would have to leave or be interned; her captain claimed that his engines were disabled which extended the deadline to eight days. In the meantime, &quot;Kent&quot; had summoned &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the two ships entered Cumberland Bay in the island on the morning of 14 March and found &quot;Dresden&quot; at anchor. The German ship trained her guns on the British ships and &quot;Glasgow&quot; opened fire, Luce justifying his action by deeming it an unfriendly act by an interned ship that had frequently violated Chilean neutrality. &quot;Dresden&quot; hoisted a white flag four minutes later as she was already on fire and holed at her waterline. A boat brought Lieutenant Wilhelm Canaris to &quot;Glasgow&quot; to complain that his ship was under Chilean protection. Luce told him that the question of neutrality could be settled by diplomats and that he would destroy the German ship unless she surrendered. By the time that Canaris returned to &quot;Dresden&quot;, her crew had finished preparations for scuttling and abandoned ship after opening her Kingston valves. It took 20 minutes before the cruiser capsized to port and sank. The British shells had killed one midshipman and eight sailors and wounded three officers and twelve ratings. After the sinking, a sailor from &quot;Glasgow&quot; noticed a pig swimming in the water and, after nearly being drowned by the frightened pig, succeeded in rescuing him. The crew named him &#x27;Tirpitz&#x27;, and he served as the ship&#x27;s mascot for a year and was then transferred to Whale Island Gunnery School, Portsmouth, for the rest of his life.

===Subsequent activities===
After re-coaling at Vallenar, &quot;Glasgow&quot; moved to the Atlantic coast of South America and searched for German ships, mostly around the estuary of the River Plate. On 9 October she departed for Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, to begin a refit and arrived there on the 20th. The refit was completed on 24 December and the ship departed that day for the Abrolhos Rocks where she arrived on 11 January 1916. &quot;Glasgow&quot; then cruised to São Vicente, Cape Verde, where Luce was promoted to Commodore, 2nd Class on the 29th. Three days later, the ship set sail for the South American coast where she resumed patrolling for German ships. On 14 October, &quot;Glasgow&quot; arrived back in Simon&#x27;s Town for another refit that was completed on 27 December, after which the ship returned to South America after a diversion to Sierra Leone. Commodore Aubrey Smith relieved Luce on 8 November.

When &quot;Glasgow&quot; arrived at Abrolhos Rocks on 22 January 1917, Smith had to coordinate the search for the commerce raider that was ultimately unsuccessful, with his own ship patrolling off the Brazilian coast. At the beginning of January 1918, the ship was en route to Sierra Leone, where she arrived on the 16th. Departing four days later, the ship reached Gibraltar on 30 January and continued onwards to Portsmouth where she began a refit on 18 February. By July &quot;Glasgow&quot; was assigned to the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron in the Adriatic Sea. On 2 October the ship covered the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania, by Allied forces.
By April 1919, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was en route home, but the ship had been paid off at Gibraltar by 1 May. By 1 July, she had been recommissioned and was en route to Britain again. By 18 July, the ship had been reduced to reserve in Portsmouth and she was paid off there on 2 February 1920. &quot;Glasgow&quot; served as a stokers&#x27; training ship in 1922–1926 before she was sold for scrap on 29 April 1927 to Thos. W. Ward, of Morecambe.

<doc id="1176143" wikidata="Q3270407" url="?curid=1176143" title="Act on National Flag and Anthem">
<text>The , abbreviated as , is a law that formally established Japan&#x27;s national flag and anthem. Before its ratification on August 13, 1999, there was no official flag or anthem for Japan. The flag, commonly referred to as the , had represented Japan unofficially since 1870; had been used as Japan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; anthem since 1880.

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, there were suggestions to legislate the &quot;hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the official symbols of Japan. However, a law to establish the &quot;hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as official in 1974 failed in the National Diet, due to the opposition of the Japan Teachers Union that insists they have a connection with Japanese militarism. It was suggested that both the &quot;hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; should be made official after a school principal in Hiroshima committed suicide over a dispute regarding the use of the flag and anthem in a school ceremony.

After a vote in both houses of the National Diet, the law was passed on August 9, 1999. Promulgated and enforced on August 13, 1999, it was considered one of the most controversial laws passed by the National Diet in the 1990s. The debate surrounding the law also revealed a split in the leadership of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the unity of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and coalition partners.

The passage of the law was met with mixed reactions. Although some Japanese hailed the passage, others felt that it was a shift toward restoring nationalistic feelings and culture: It was passed in time for the tenth anniversary of the Emperor Akihito&#x27;s reign. In the countries that Japan had occupied during World War II, some felt that the law&#x27;s passage, along with debates on laws related to military affairs and Yasukuni Shrine, marked a shift in Japan toward the political right. Regulations and government orders issued in the wake of this law, especially those issued by the Tokyo Board of Education, were also challenged in court by some Japanese due to conflicts with the Japanese constitution.

==Text of the act==
The Act on National Flag and Anthem established the Nisshōki as the national flag and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the national anthem. Details about each symbol were provided in appendices, including specifications for the construction of the flag and sheet music for &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. The law made no provisions for the use or treatment of either symbol, leading to different national and prefectural agencies and ministries creating their own regulations. If rules about the use of the flag and anthem had been included in the act, it would not have gained enough support in the Diet to pass.

===Provisions for the flag===

The drawing and construction details of the flag are given in the first appendix. The overall ratio of the flag is two-units length to three-units width (2:3). The red disc is at the exact center of the flag and its diameter is three-fifths of the flag&#x27;s height. However, the 1999 law allowed the continued use and manufacture of flags with the proportions set down in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Proclamation No. 57 of 1870, which stipulated that the flag have a seven-to-ten (7:10) ratio, with the red disc off-center by one-hundredth of the flag&#x27;s length toward the side of the hoist. The background of the flag is white, and the disc red, but the exact color shades were not defined in the 1999 law. Further explanations from the government merely stated that the red color is a deep shade. Specifications published by the Ministry of Defense in 2008 defined the shades of red for the flag. During deliberations in the Diet about this bill, there was a suggestion to either use a bright red () shade or choose from the color pool of the Japanese Industrial Standards.

===Provisions for the anthem===
The lyrics and musical notation of the anthem are given in the second appendix. The text of the law does not credit a single person for the lyrics or music, but the notation credits Hiromori Hayashi for the musical arrangement. However, evidence suggests that Yoshiisa Oku and Akimori Hayashi (son of Hiromori) authored the music; the elder Hayashi had put his name on it for serving as their supervisor and Chief Court Musician of the Imperial Court. The melody was eventually put to a Western-style harmony by Franz Eckert and has been in use since 1880. The lyrics on the sheet music are in hiragana, and there is no mention for a tempo for the vocal arrangement. The anthem is played in the Dorian mode in common (4/4) time.

==&quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; before 1999==
The &quot;hinomaru&quot; was widely used on military banners in the Sengoku period of the 15th and 16th centuries. During the Meiji Restoration, on February 27, 1870 (January 27, 3rd year of Meiji in the Japanese calendar), the flag was officially adopted as the civil ensign by Proclamation No. 57. The &quot;hinomaru&quot; was legally the national flag from 1870 to 1885, but Japanese law did not designate a national flag from 1885 to 1999 because with the modernization of the cabinet, all of the prior Council of States&#x27; declarations were abolished. Despite this, several military banners of Japan are based on the design of the &quot;hinomaru,&quot; including the sun-rayed Naval Ensign. The &quot;hinomaru&quot; was used as a template to design other Japanese flags, and its use was severely restricted during the early years of the Allied-occupation after World War II, although these restrictions were later relaxed.

&quot;Kimigayo&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s shortest national anthems, with a length of 11 measures and 32 characters. Its lyrics are based on a Waka poem written in the Heian period (794–1185) and sung to a melody composed in the Meiji era (1868–1912). In 1869, John William Fenton, a visiting Irish military band leader, realized there was no national anthem in Japan, and suggested to Iwao Ōyama, an officer of the Satsuma Clan, that one be created. Ōyama agreed, and selected the lyrics.

The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem because of Fenton&#x27;s influence. After selecting the anthem&#x27;s lyrics, Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. This was the first version of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, which was discarded because the melody &quot;lacked solemnity.&quot; In 1880, the Imperial Household Agency adopted the current melody of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, and the government formally adopted &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the national anthem in 1888. By 1893, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was included in public school ceremonies due to the efforts of the then Ministry of Education. During the Allied-occupation of Japan, there were no directives by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to restrict use of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; by the Japanese government. However, only the score of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was played during official ceremonies following the war; the lyrics were not sung.

==Background of the legislation==
The proposal for the law was motivated by the suicide of a school principal in Hiroshima, who could not resolve a dispute between his school board and his teachers over use of the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. The principal of Sera High School in Sera, Ishikawa Toshihiro, killed himself the evening before his school&#x27;s graduation ceremony. The Hiroshima Prefecture School Board had demanded that all principals ensure use of both symbols at every school ceremony, but the teachers at Sera High School vehemently opposed the practice. Ishikawa took his own life after failing to win support of his teachers on this issue.

Ishikawa&#x27;s suicide, along with the protests by teachers at the graduation ceremony at Sera High School, prompted Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to draft legislation to make the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; the official symbols of Japan. He intended for the legislation to be introduced in 2000, but his Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted it in effect by November 1999, the tenth anniversary of the enthronement of Emperor Akihito and start of Heisei era).

This is not the first time legislation was proposed to make the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; official symbols. After the return of Okinawa Prefecture to Japan from American rule in 1972 and the global oil crisis of 1973, then-Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted in 1974 at the passage of a law that would legalize use of both symbols, a move done partially to increase his popularity with conservative voters. At the time of his suggestion, the Japan Teachers Union was opposed to using the anthem because it &quot;smacked of emperor worship&quot; and was seen as a connection to pre-war militarism. Although the literacy rate in Japan was 99 percent at the time, many students did not know what &quot;Kimigayo&quot; even was or how to sing it. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, Kakuei wanted students to raise the flag and read the Imperial Rescript on Education, pronounced by the Emperor Meiji in 1890, every morning. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the legislation through the Diet.

==Party positions==
===In support===
The main conservative parties of Japan, the LDP and the Liberal Party, were the chief supporters of the 1999 bill. LDP General Secretary Yoshirō Mori stated in June of that year that the Japanese people had accepted both the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as national symbols. The President of the Liberal Party, Ichirō Ozawa, echoed the same sentiment and believed that the Diet could not conclude otherwise. The New Komeito (also known as the Clean Government Party, or CGP) was initially cautious about the bill. Although some of its leadership conceded that both symbols were accepted by the people, they believed that establishing the idea as a law could be a violation of the Japanese Constitution. The CGP eventually supported the bill in exchange for being allowed into the LDP coalition.

===In opposition===
The Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (JCP) opposed the bill because of the connotations both symbols have with the war era, and because the public was not given the option to settle the issue by a referendum. The chairman of the CPJ said that the party would prefer new symbols that represent a democratic and peaceful Japan. The SDPJ&#x27;s opposition was a change from its previous stance toward the symbols; Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of the Japan Socialist Party (the SDPJ&#x27;s former name) accepted both the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the symbols of Japan in exchange for support from the LDP in the National Diet in 1994.

===The Democratic Party of Japan===
The then-president of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Naoto Kan, stated that his party must support the bill because it had already recognized both as symbols of Japan. Then-Deputy Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama believed that the bill would cause further problems for school officials and unrest among leftist groups that oppose the flag and anthem. The DPJ offered an amendment to the bill that designated the Hinomaru as the national flag but gave &quot;Kimigayo&quot; no special status; an alternative anthem was to be found. On July 16, the DPJ decided to issue its amendment; if it was rejected, the party members would be allowed to vote freely. Other groups issued their own bills against the government&#x27;s legislation; they were all rejected before the main vote on the bill.

==Public opinion==
In the week before the vote in the House of Councillors, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; conducted a poll in Tokyo, Osaka and Hiroshima. Approximately nine out of ten respondents favored having the Hinomaru as the national flag, and six out of ten supported &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the national anthem. Overall, about 46 percent were in favor of the bill. Respondents thought of the Hinomaru as the flag of Japan and that its history should be taught. Some felt that &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was an inappropriate anthem for modern Japan; one respondent suggested using the song &quot;Sakura Sakura&quot; instead. Another suggestion was to keep the melody of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; but replace the lyrics.

A March 1999 poll conducted by the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and one by the Japan Research Council on Public Opinion Polls in July 1999 yielded different results from the poll by &quot;The Japan Times&quot;. In the former, taken after the suicide of Toshihiro, 61 percent felt that the symbols of Japan should be the Hinomaru as the flag and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the anthem; 64 percent felt it desirable to have both symbols used at school ceremonies, and percent felt both symbols should be enshrined in law. The poll by the Japan Research Council on Public Opinion Polls showed similar results; 68 percent felt that both the Hinomaru and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; were the symbols of Japan; 71 percent supported the bill in the Diet. Both polls had slightly less than 2,000 respondents. There was 15 percent more support for the Hinomaru than for &quot;Kimigayo&quot;; the lyrics of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; were directly associated with the emperor. Both polls also showed that older generations had a greater attachment to the symbols, while younger generations exhibited more negative feelings.

==Vote==
The House of Representatives passed the bill on 22 July 1999 by a 403-to-86 vote during the 145th National Diet.

The legislation was then sent to the House of Councillors on 28 July and passed on 9 August 1999 by a 166-to-71 vote. It was enacted as law on August 13.

==Reactions==
===Domestic===
Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi was enthusiastic over the passage of the law because it established a &quot;clear basis by written law&quot; for use of the symbols. He felt this was a major step for Japan to &quot;move into the 21st century&quot;. Emperor Akihito declined to comment on the law when asked at a press conference on his birthday (December 23), mostly due to the constitutional prohibition for the Emperor to speak on political matters. However, Emperor Akihito expressed displeasure to Tokyo Education Board member Kunio Yonenaga in 2004 that forcing teachers and students to honor the flag and anthem was not &quot;desirable.&quot; The head of a teachers&#x27; federation praised the legislation, believing it would help them inculcate people with a proper sense of respect for a country&#x27;s symbols, thereby reducing international incidents such as the booing of other countries&#x27; anthems by the Japanese. The legislation also drew condemnation from certain Japanese who were disdainful of their country&#x27;s actions in World War II. They felt that unless their government issued a formal apology—expressed with &quot;true remorse&quot; for those incidents—they saw no reason to be proud about the flag and anthem. Ozawa saw the passage of this law and a few others in 1999 as heralds of a &quot;bloodless revolution&quot; toward a new future—a revolution that would change Japan&#x27;s national identity and set up changes to its Constitution.

Within education, a major battleground where the use of the symbols was fought, the reactions were also mixed. The 1999 curriculum guideline issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the law decrees that &quot;on entrance and graduation ceremonies, schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing the &quot;Kimigayo&quot; (national anthem), given the significance of the flag and the song.&quot; Additionally, the ministry&#x27;s commentary on the 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools notes that &quot;given the advance of internationalization, along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese, it is important to nurture school children&#x27;s respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society.&quot;

In Hiroshima Prefecture, where Sera High School is located, the reaction was mostly negative. As one of the two prefectures directly affected by World War II, education in Hiroshima has leaned left with regards to information regarding the symbols and the Emperor due to the power of native groups, such as the Buraku Liberation League, and teachers&#x27; unions. There the passage of the law was seen as an &quot;annoyance&quot;, running counter to the prefecture&#x27;s educational practices and unlikely to be able to resolve its war-related issues.

===International===
However, the spokesperson for the mainland Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the bill was an issue for the Japanese to resolve on their own to move their country toward a peaceful future. In Singapore, older generations still harbored ill feelings toward the symbols. The Philippine government believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism and that the goal of the law was to formally establish two national symbols, which every state has a right to do.

==Political ramifications==
Members of the DPJ were allowed by party leaders to vote based on their own conscience; the party leadership itself was split. Hatoyama overcame his opposition and voted for the bill, along with DPJ Secretary General and Tsutomu Hata. Kan voted against the bill. With the exception of the DPJ, each party voted strictly along party lines, and none among them broke party discipline. Ironically, Hatoyama wanted to use his vote for the bill as a call to his fellow DPJ members for unity. Half of the DPJ supported the bill, reducing the numbers that would have opposed it and making it easier for the bill to pass. The split of the DPJ vote showed the lack of unity of its members.

Another factor that played into the passage of the bill was the coalition of the LDP, the Liberal Party and the CGP. In the Diet, the union between the LDP and the Liberal Party gave them a majority in the lower house but not in the House of Councilors. The leadership of the LDP considered Ozawa to be a traitor because he left the LDP in 1993, yet the LDP needed him and his party to form a coalition to govern. Although the CGP had a relatively small number of seats (52) in the lower house and had nothing in common with the LDP in terms of policy, it was tempted by the idea of being part of the ruling cabinet and supported the LDP in passing the bill. The Social Democratic Party had to abandon key party platforms—such as their earlier opposition to the symbols, security treaties with the United States and the existence of the Self Defense Forces—to join the coalition. Despite the concessions of the SPDJ, the LDP did not advance any of the traditional platforms championed by the SPDJ. Eventually, those policies advocated by the SPDJ were removed from the national policy debate. The only party that stuck to its stance throughout the debate was the Communist Party; the CGP (New Komeito), Liberal Party and SDPJ switched sides to support the bill.

Such vote switching led a writer for &quot;The Japan Times&quot; to question the rationality of the country&#x27;s politics over the passage of the bill. The act is one of the most controversial laws passed by the Diet since the 1992 Law Concerning Cooperation for United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and Other Operations, also known as the &quot;International Peace Cooperation Law&quot; which committed Japan to United Nations peacekeeping operations, a deviation from Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which calls on the country to renounce the &quot;use of force as means of settling international disputes.&quot;

==Enforcement and lawsuits==
When the law was passed, Prime Minister Obuchi and other officials stated that there was no intention to regulate the use of the flag and the anthem in everyday life. However, the 1999 curriculum guideline issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem decrees that &quot;on entrance and graduation ceremonies, schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, given the significance of the flag and the song.&quot;

In Tokyo, regulations were put in place in 2003. As part of that city&#x27;s regulations, board or school officials are required to record names of teachers who do not stand or sing, and the flag is displayed facing the students during ceremonies. Sanctions ranged from reprimands, re-education courses, pay cuts, loss of duties to termination; and the sanctions were encouraged by Shintaro Ishihara, the Governor of Tokyo. In 2004, 243 teachers were disciplined and 67 teachers were warned for either not following policies or for instructing their students not to honor both symbols.

One city in Fukuoka Prefecture measured and rated each school on how loudly the students sang &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, but Tokyo was the only school board that issued large-scale punishments for not following the regulations. According to the Tokyo Board of Education, more than 400 people have been punished since 2004.

Several lawsuits were filed to challenge the Tokyo regulations on grounds that the order violated Article 19 of the Japanese Constitution, granting &quot;freedom of thought and conscience.&quot; The Tokyo District Court sided with the teachers, ruling that teachers cannot be forced to stand or sing. However, its decisions are either being appealed or have already been overturned by the Tokyo High Court, which ruled that the order does not represent a violation of the Constitution. Over a dozen lawsuits, ranging from the constitutionality of the Tokyo order to the compensation of the punished teachers, have been filed in Japanese courts. The latest, filed in 2011, was rejected by the Supreme Court; the Court agreed with the Tokyo High Court that requiring teachers to stand for &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was not a violation of the Constitution. After this ruling, the Osaka Prefectural Assembly passed an ordinance on June 3, 2011, ordering teachers and other school employees in Osaka to stand and sing when &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is played during school ceremonies.

<text>Rhett Stowe Harty (born March 8, 1970, in Pasadena, California) is an American former soccer defender who spent one season in the Western Soccer League, one in the Continental Indoor Soccer League, one in the USISL and three with the MetroStars of Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===High School and college===
Harty grew up in Los Angeles and attended Servite High School where he played on the boys’ soccer team. He was a Parade Magazine high school All American in 1987 and 1988. After graduating from Servite in 1988, he entered Stanford University. He played three years, then red shirted a season while he played with the U.S. Olympic soccer team as it qualified for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. A late injury kept him from travelling with the team. He returned to Stanford and graduated in 1993 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and classical studies. During his final year of college, Harty had an internship with an electrophysiology doctor. After graduation, the doctor offered him a position in his practice, but Harty declined and became a professional soccer player instead.

===Minor leagues===
In 1989, Harty spent the collegiate off season with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer League (WSL). After graduating from Stanford, Harty was sidelined for nearly two years with a back injury. In 1994, he signed with the expansion San Jose Grizzlies of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. In 1995, he moved to the Monterey Bay Jaguars of USISL.

===MLS===
In February 1996, the San Jose Clash drafted Harty in the fourth round of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft; however, he never played a game for his hometown club. When Troy Dayak, who was drafted by the MetroStars, demanded a trade to San Jose, Harty was shipped cross-country in the first trade in MLS history.

Harty, a midfielder initially, immediately stepped into the Metro defense. After the team struggled early in the year, he shaved his head, and the Metros went on to win their next three games. The head would stay shaven throughout his MLS career, and Harty quickly became a fan favorite, earning the nickname &quot;Mr. Clean&quot;. He scored one goal and three assists in his three years in the league, plus added a goal in Open Cup play.

Rhett was on the forefront in the MLS players&#x27; antitrust lawsuit against the league, challenging its single entity structure. Lowballed with a small offer, he chose to retire from soccer instead.

==Post soccer career==
Following his retirement from professional soccer, Harty spent the next six months traveling in India and Tibet, soul-searching and helping out the people of the area. He found a new calling in medicine, and moved to the Portland, Oregon, area, where he prepares pacemakers and defibrillators for patients as an employee of St. Jude Medical.

<doc id="1176146" wikidata="Q1428906" url="?curid=1176146" title="Flip Skateboards">
<text>Flip Skateboards is a United States–based international skateboard company, co-owned by Jeremy Fox and Ian Deacon. The company produces skateboard hard goods (decks, wheels, bearings, completes, and hardware), soft goods (T-shirts, tops, sweatshirts, hats, beanies, and socks), DVDs, and accessories. The brand was distributed globally by US company NHS Inc. but has since parted with the distribution. Starting in July 2017, the brand is distributed in Europe by HLC and has now taken over global distribution.

==History==

===Deathbox===
Deathbox Skateboards was started in 1987 in the UK by Graham McEachran, Jeremy Fox and Duncan Houlton. Tom Penny, Rune Glifberg, Andy Scott and Geoff Rowley joined the company while this name still existed.

===Relocation to the US===
Flip moved from the United Kingdom (UK) to California, US in July 1994. Jeremy Fox, Ian Deacon and Geoff Rowley arrived in the US first, followed by team riders Tom Penny and Rune Glifberg in the following year. At the time of the relocation, the team consisted of four professional riders: Penny, Rowley, Glifberg and Andy Scott. The company and its riders received significant support from professional skateboarder Ed Templeton, who owned his own company, Toy Machine. Rowley stated that Templeton and his company &quot;opened their arms to us, gave us local support, and had our back. Any ignorance was small and only served to make us stronger…..and faster!!!&quot; Despite the brand&#x27;s foundation in the US, in 2006 Rowley stated:
All the company owners are still British citizens, one runs a large percentage of our workday directly from England for the last five years, I would say that makes us British until death. People can consider us whatever they want but saying untrue negative things regarding these matters is just downright childish. The things Flip/Deathbox did for England and the English skate scene should not be sneered at ... there is no other way to get to the level we are at, without first accepting where skateboarding was born from, and respecting that all the mags are driven from here also, it is hard to gain friends if you aren’t visible.

A European based company cannot and will not be accepted across the whole of the USA unless they embrace those areas and live them, Flip is strong worldwide for this reason, plus running a business of this nature isn’t viable based in England, too costly.

Reflecting upon the company&#x27;s move to the US:
We were a totally new company moving to a foreign country, and I don&#x27;t think we kind of expected it to go &quot;boom&quot;, and just fly right in. We had no expectations; we didn&#x27;t really know that many people, and we actually just wanted to skate, really. Because we grew up dreaming of living in California and getting to wake up every day and go out and skate without it raining, and I think that was something that, like, all of the guys, when we first moved here, you know, Rune [Glifberg] and Tom [Penny], that was something that, you couldn&#x27;t hold us back in that respect. I&#x27;d just turned eighteen, Tom was seventeen, neither of us had lived away from home, you know. We&#x27;d moved to a foreign country where we didn&#x27;t know anybody. Nobody. We had no money, we didn&#x27;t have any cars, alls we had was the board that we had; we couldn&#x27;t go breaking those. we couldn&#x27;t afford to, at the time, starting a company, we couldn&#x27;t afford to run through ten boards a month ... Like myself, personally, I skated a lot with Ed [Templeton], like, every day, because he lived, like, right across the road from me.

===Team departures===
In what was perceived as a shocking decision by the global skateboard community, long-time team rider Arto Saari announced his decision to leave Flip in 2008. In an interview with skateboard journalist Chris Nieratko following his decision (Saari later contacted Nieratko to prevent the interview from being published and the journalist published it on his personal website instead), Saari explained the process of leaving Flip:
It was really heavy but they [Flip] took it pretty good. I thought they were going to come and chop my legs off but they were very reasonable about it but it’s been a heavy process. It’s been on good terms. I just felt like I had to move on. I changed all my other sponsors, I might as well. Why stop now? New knee, new liver, new shoe company, new board sponsor ... Yeah, I did shed a few tears. It’s like getting a divorce; even though I’ve never been married other than Flip. I can imagine it’s something like that. There’s parts that you like but there’s parts that you just want to move on past. It’s really hard to deal with. You wonder, ‘Are you going to lose friends? Are you going to lose business?’ It was a tough decision to make and I’m still spun out about it. I can’t believe that it’s all happening but I think it will be for the better for everyone ... I just couldn’t take it any longer. I couldn’t take the madness and I thought it would be better to move on than to stay somewhere where I don’t think I necessarily belong anymore. Things have changed a lot over the years and I thought it would be better to explore something new, to be like a little kid in a candy store.

In the Nieratko interview, Saari also discussed Rowley&#x27;s response to his decision:
&quot;Don’t do it.&quot; He knew it had to happen. We’re still cool. He understands. He’s like, &quot;Go do your thing. Go skate around.&quot; It was a very, very emotional, gnarly thing. It’s been so many years in the same boat you have to start going in different ways. Sometimes the ship gets too small, too many egos, you got to jump overboard and catch the next one and see where that takes you.

In 2012, Saari provided further insight into his decision to leave Flip, citing the death of former teammate Shane Cross as a significant underpinning factor: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t, like, a easy thing to do, but, at the time, I knew I had to do it ... for the reasons that happened, you know? And that&#x27;s why I decided that it&#x27;s better off for me to leave Flip than, just, go my own way and, just, do that.&quot; Professional skateboarder Ed Templeton stated in a 2012 interview: &quot;I mean I was completely shocked when he left Flip ... it didn&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

At the start of January 2011, Flip announced that Saari had rejoined the team and released an image that featured Saari alongside the caption &quot;Home is Where the Hearto Is&quot;. A video segment was also published on the website of &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine and featured Rowley, Saari and &quot;Thrasher&quot; editor-in-chief, Jake Phelps, discussing the decision in Phelps&#x27; office in San Francisco, US. Saari explained to Phelps that Flip is like &quot;family&quot; and stated &quot;You can take a man out of Flip, but you can&#x27;t take the Flip out the man&quot;.

In 2012, Fox disclosed the process of re-recruiting Saari:
I went up and saw him with Geoff, one day, because it seemed like he really ... well, I could tell; we could all tell that he wanted to be back on the team. Arto&#x27;s not a very pushy person, at all. Never the guy who will ask for anything, and I just said to Geoff one day, &quot;Let&#x27;s just, we need to drive up there and then, and just put him back on the team. Make him put himself back on; because, otherwise, this is never going to happen.&quot; Maybe he&#x27;d grown up and realized that it might be a little dysfunctional family, but it is my family.

Also in 2012, Saari has stated:
It was a pretty unspoken thing. It wasn&#x27;t until the last minute that, it was like, &quot;You wanna get back on?&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah&quot;. Those are the guys who brought me up, backed me up. And I was, like, &quot;You know what? I gotta, I gotta get back on.&quot;

Established team rider Mark Appleyard left Flip to join Element Skateboards in October 2010. In an October 2010 interview, Appleyard explained his decision:
I was over it [laughs]. I feel like I grew out of it and the team changed so much over the years that I was just like, &quot;this shit ain’t for me anymore,&quot; and I just needed to feel more stoked on the company I ride for, so I had to change it up ... Yeah it was hard to leave, but it’s a business move. Ya know? If someone’s gonna be your friend, it shouldn’t depend on what company you ride for. I just had to make a power move to benefit myself. I’m really stoked on the choice I made. It was difficult but it had to be done ... I mean, I had a lot of options and I just figured that Element best suits my vibe. It’s just a nice company and kinda earthy and nature-y and stuff. I just felt like, &quot;Damn that’s where I wana be.&quot; And then I met up with the guys and they were really cool and we just clicked. I’m down–it’s sick.

In December 2010, another established team member, Rodrigo Teixeira, also announced his departure from Flip and the official statement from the company read: &quot;Everyone at Flip would like to thank Rodrigo for all the good times and wish him all the best for the future.&quot; Teixeira subsequently joined the roster of skateboard deck company Dirty Ghetto Kids (DGK) and explained his decision in a January 2011 interview: &quot;I feel like it was time for me to make a move and do what I wanted to do. With DGK we are into the same things. We can all kick it and skate at the same spot. It’s just more who I am.&quot;

In October 2015 Geoff Rowley left flip.

===2010 onward===
Following his appearance in the &quot;Extremely Sorry&quot; video, English skateboarder Ben Nordberg—originally from Bath, Somerset—released his first ever full-length video part for the company in May 2012. Team riders Louie Lopez and Curren Caples were assigned professional status in late September 2013—professional surfer Kelly Slater presented Caples with his first professional skateboard deck model, while Lopez received his first model at a piñata party. Alex Majerus was assigned professional status in early July 2014 and a surprise party was held; Although Rowley could not be present, he spoke with Majerus by telephone during the event.

The &quot;3&quot; Flip video project was published on the &quot;TransWorld SKATEboarding&quot; website on July 21, 2014. Directed and filmed by Saar1, with the assistance of Josh Zucker, the video features Caples, Lopez and Majerus, and was filmed over a period of three months.

==Cheech and Chong graphic==
In 2012, it was initially released in the 90s Flip released an advertisement entitled &quot;Legalized!&quot;, referring to the official licensing that the company had secured for a Cheech &amp; Chong (comedy duo, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong) graphic that had been used, thus far, for a Penny signature model. Rowley explained in 2009:
Tom loved Cheech and Chong for obvious reasons. He’s had a bunch of rad ones that he’s brought to Flip. But that one, along with the mushroom board, is probably the most iconic. We winged it at first, then eventually they found out. Cheech Marin was rad enough to continue letting us make the board as long as he got some royalties. So we actually still pay him on a monthly basis. Cheech Marin has been on the Flip payroll since 2000.

The text in the 2012 advertisement read: &quot;The officially approved (and legally licensed this time!) Cheech and Chong Tom Penny boards are back.&quot;, and in 2009, Rowley stated, &quot;It came out in ’96 and is still one of our best-selling boards today.&quot;

==Awards==
Five team members (former and current) have won the &quot;Thrasher&quot; Skater of the Year Award: Bob Burnquist in 1997 (he was sponsored by Anti-Hero at the time), Geoff Rowley in 2000, Arto Saari in 2001, Mark Appleyard in 2003 (Appleyard also won Best Street Skater at the 2007 &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; awards), and David González in 2012.

In responses to questions about how it felt to win the Thrasher accolade, Rowley stated, &quot;Fucking weird, though it was flattering!&quot;, Saari stated, &quot;I never thought it would actually like ... whatever, happen to me, or what not. Like, it&#x27;s just one of those things that&#x27;s just come out of the blue, you know?&quot;, and González exclaimed, &quot;You don&#x27;t even know how fucking stoked I am dude!&quot;

==Contest history==
In 2012, Luan Oliveira won the Maloof Money Cup in South Africa, while Burnquist placed second in the &quot;Vert&quot; category. Oliveira is also part of the Street League Skateboarding contest roster.

Amateur rider Alec Majerus achieved first place in the 2012 Tampa Am contest, held at the Skatepark of Tampa skate park in Tampa, Florida, US—Majerus competed against 300 other amateur skateboarders to win the prize.

<text>The Mundari are a small ethnic group of South Sudan. They are a part of the Karo people, one of the Karo ethnic Group

The group is composed of cattle-herders and agriculturalists and are part of Karo people which also includes Bari, Pojulu, Kakwa, Kuku and Nyangwara. Kutuk na Mundari is also the name of their language, which is similar to Kutuk na Kuku, Kutuk na Kakwa, Kutuk na Pojulu, Kutuk na Bari, and Kutuk na Nyangwara.

== Tribal land ==
The traditional Mundari tribal lands are located roughly 75 kilometers north of Juba, the capital of South Sudan, and are centered on the town of Terekeka in the state of Central Equatoria. They are bordered to the north by the Bor Dinka at Pariak, and to the south by the Bari of Juba 12 km at the Gwerkek north of Peiti Northern Bari of Juba base on 1956 British Colonial boundaries. Their lands are bounded on the east by the White Nile and extend west to Laka Ma&#x27;di in Western Equatoria state, an area roughly 100 by 75 kilometers in size.

The land, like much of South Sudan, is predominantly flat and marked by occasional isolated large hills. The low-lying land contains many rivers and lakes and is prone to flooding during the rainy season. The soil is predominantly clay-based, causing drainage and water retention problems, and provides a very fertile basis in support of cattle grazing. The main settlements in Mundariland are Terekeka, Gemeiza, Mangalla, Muni, Tombek, Tindilo, Tali, Rego, Tijor, Rijong, Koweri, and Nyori.

== Culture ==
The Mundari, like other Nilotic tribes, are very cattle-oriented: cattle serve as a form of currency and a mark of status. Marriages are arranged by the prospective groom offering cattle to the bride&#x27;s family and husbands may take as many wives as they can support. The Mundari engage in perennial cattle raiding wars with the Bor Dinka during the dry season.

Mundari men sometimes bathe their hair in cow urine; the uric acid gives the hair a red, yellow, or orange color, which they regard as beautiful.

The Mundari also cultivate sorghum and catch fish using nets and spears.

In common with other Nilotic tribes in Sudan, the Mundari practice ritual scarification as a rite of passage into adulthood for young men. The typical Mundari scar pattern consists of two sets of three parallel lines, each on either side of the forehead, extending in a downward slope and unconnected in the middle.

<text>The SEAT Toledo is a small family car produced by the Spanish manufacturer SEAT, part of Volkswagen Group. The Toledo name was first introduced to the SEAT line up in May 1991 being named after a Spanish city with the same name, with the fourth generation being introduced at the end of 2012, for the model year of 2013. Production ended in February 2019, and the nameplate is currently not in use.

==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 1L; 1991)==

The initial version of the SEAT Toledo (&quot;Typ&quot; 1L) was launched as a four-door fastback saloon, and its sales career lasted from May 1991 to March 1999. Technically it was a five-door liftback, as its boot lid opened together with the rear window.

This generation of the Toledo was the first SEAT automobile developed entirely under Volkswagen Group ownership, and it was built on the Golf Mk2 Volkswagen Group A2 platform with a 550-litre boot expandable to 1360 litres when folding rear seats, larger in shape and size than the Volkswagen Jetta/Vento&#x27;s combined with the advantage of a tailgate.

As saloon versions of small family cars were rare in Europe, it was sometimes considered a large family car due to its overall length and boot size, despite having comparably less rear leg room, and pricing closer to small family cars.

It went on sale in most of Europe in May 1991, though it did not arrive on the British market until October 1991, with the official launch at the London Motorfair. The Toledo was the first SEAT to be sold in Sweden, when it went on sale there at the turn of the year.

The Toledo initially featured the then standard range of Volkswagen Group engines for the class, from a base 1.6 L petrol engine up to one &quot;GT&quot; version using the 2.0 L engine.

Later, the Toledo would see the addition of more powerful versions, including a 2.0 GTI 16v, and 1.9 TDI which, like many diesel engines built since 1996 by the Volkswagen Group, is advertised as capable of running on either mineral diesel or biodiesel.

This model later received a mild facelift in September 1995, and made its début at the 1995 Frankfurt Motor Show. Sales were not strong however, as has been the case for all the generations of the Toledo.

===Rebadges===

This generation of the Toledo has also been produced by the Chinese manufacturer Chery, and sold under the names of &quot;Chery A11&quot;, &quot;Chery Windcloud&quot; and &quot;Chery A15&quot;, &quot;Chery A168&quot;, &quot;Chery Amulet&quot;, &quot;Chery Cowin&quot;, &quot;Chery Qiyun&quot;, &quot;Chery Flagcloud&quot;. Chery acquired the chassis of the 1993 Toledo from a Mexican dealership, after authorisation from SEAT.

Chery Cowin, which is based on the SEAT Toledo, already has an authorisation to market it in Europe, along with Russia and South America. Apart from the Chery rebadged models, the first generation Toledo is also currently built by the Russian car maker TagAZ, rebranded as the &quot;Vortex Corda&quot;.

===Awards===

==Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 1M; 1998)==

The second generation Toledo (&quot;Typ&quot; 1M) was introduced in 1998, and made its début at the 1998 Paris Motor Show as a four-door notchback saloon. Sales commenced in October 1998. It went on sale there in March 1999.

It was more rounded than the previous first generation shape and had a much more fluid design, although both were products of Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign studio, with the latest generation being influenced by SEAT&#x27;s chief of exterior design Steve Lewis.

It shared components with its Volkswagen and Škoda PQ34 platform mates, the Volkswagen Bora and the Škoda Octavia, being positioned as the sportiest of the three. In the interior, the dashboard was derived from that of the first generation Audi A3.

It was built on the Volkswagen Golf Mk4 platform, which meant stiff springs to support the load of the large 500 litre boot increased to 830 litres when folding rear seats.

The early models were built at the Volkswagen/Audi plant in Belgium, with improved build quality (compared to the Spanish built previous generation), although the Toledo was still presented as an economic alternative to the lower level of the D-segment, and included in the basic price a high level of equipment.

One of the features most associated with the Spanish model, the tailgate was removed in favour of a more traditional four door saloon boot opening. The following year, the Toledo would be used as the base for a proper hatchback, the SEAT León Mark 1.

Base model was now a crossflow 1.6 litre petrol engine, followed by a 1.8 litre twenty valve unit, while the top of the line was represented by the 2.3 litre VR5 engine (V5).

Diesel engined versions used the 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) engine, with a variable geometry turbocharger, offered initially with power outputs of or . In 2001, the V5 engine was uprated with a 20v head (four valves per cylinder), boosting power to .

Later in the series, the 1.8 litre twenty valve Toledo received a turbocharger, capable of delivering , and a later evolution of the VW TDI engine, produced engines of and .

These three versions all featured a six speed manual transmission. The 130 PS TDI also featured white dials instead of the standard black dials on the 110 and 150 PS TDI models. Production of the &quot;Typ&quot; 1M Toledo ended in July 2004.

===Motorsport===

In 2003, SEAT Sport introduced the SEAT Toledo Cupra Mk2 in the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) with drivers Jordi Gené, Frank Diefenbacher and former British Touring Car Championship winner Rickard Rydell, while the &#x27;SEAT Sport Italia&#x27; Toledo Cupra Mk2 with Gianni Morbidelli also participated as an additional team.

As in 2005, the ETCC became the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), the SEAT Toledo Cupra Mk2 competed in the WTCC from 2005 to 2006. Peter Terting replaced Diefenbacher, while Jason Plato also joined the team for four rounds and Marc Carol for one round.

In 2004 and 2005 SEAT Sport also ran in the British Touring Car Championship with two SEAT Toledo Cupras Mk2 identical to those used in the European Touring Car Championship under the &#x27;SEAT Sport UK&#x27; banner. Initially, the SEAT Sport UK cars were campaigned by RML Group although at the end of the year the partnership was dissolved as RML entered the WTCC with Chevrolet and the team was run by Northern South since 2005.

At the wheel were Jason Plato, Rob Huff, James Pickford and Luke Hines. However, there were also independent teams running with SEAT Toledo Cupras Mk2 till the 2009 British Touring Car Championship season, like the Motorbase Performance, the Team Air Cool/GR Asia, the BTC Racing and the Maxtreme teams.

===Awards===
*&#x27;Die besten Autos&#x27; 1999 Award, by the German magazine &quot;Auto motor und sport&quot;
*&#x27;Carro do Ano&#x27; Award in 2000, in Portugal
==Third generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 5P; 2004)==

The third generation Toledo (&quot;Typ&quot; 5P) was introduced in 2004, and as a production car made its début at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. However, a preview of it had already been revealed at the 2004 Madrid Motor Show, with the presentation of the SEAT Toledo Prototipo. Production lasted from February 2004 to May 2009.

Its bodywork is completely different from the previous two generations: abandoning the traditional three box saloon format, the Toledo Mk3 has a five-door hatchback sedan design penned by Walter de&#x27;Silva, although now closer to a compact MPV with the Altea&#x27;s front section, a high roof, and a rear end inspired by Renault Vel Satis, paying homage to the original Toledo&#x27;s hatchback/saloon rear.

All pretense of a sporty identity was thrown out, in favour of a more upscale and alternative image. A large five hundred litre DIN boot is an interesting feature, while it can be increased to 1440 litres after folding rear seats. Under the bodywork, the SEAT Toledo uses the same underpinnings as the Volkswagen Golf Mk5.

All engines are identical to other Volkswagen Group units, with petrol engines ranging from to and diesel engines from to .

Updates include the arrival of a TDI engine in 2006, as well as a tiptronic gearbox in the 2.0 FSI model. A 1.8 L turbocharged version of this engine became available in the middle of 2007.

===Engine specifications===
The internal combustion engines used are the same as for many other cars in the Volkswagen Group, and are all inline four cylinder engines.

* only for some export markets

===Reliability===
Along with other SEATs, the Toledo has been a markedly reliable vehicle – more so than the Audi A3 and Volkswagen Golf, with which it shares platforms. In May 2006, Warranty Direct, a provider based in the United Kingdom of mechanical warranties for used cars, rated the Toledo with a higher reliability index compared to the Golf produced over the same period and the Audi A3.

In 2010, and though out of production, the Warranty direct&#x27;s Reliability index marks that the SEAT Toledo still ranks within the list of the United Kingdom&#x27;s one hundred most reliable cars of the last decade.
==Fourth generation (&quot;Typ&quot; KG; 2012)==

SEAT released an Audi A4 (B7) based large family car called the SEAT Exeo in October 2008, with both four door saloon and five door estate bodystyles. The Exeo was not intended as a direct replacement for the Toledo according to the company, although production of the Toledo was ended in May 2009, due to low sales.

A concept car based on the Toledo Mk4 production model was presented at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. This vehicle is closely related to the Škoda Rapid as a five-door liftback, both are based on an adaptation of the A05+ (PQ25) platform and are assembled in the same Škoda factory in Mladá Boleslav.

The Toledo commenced sales in Spain and Portugal towards the end of 2012, and the rest of Europe and Mexico in the beginning of 2013, with the all new Toledo sitting in between the smaller Ibiza supermini and the larger León small family car.

The Toledo received a five star rating in the Euro NCAP.

The Toledo was pulled from UK sales lineup due to poor sales in November 2018. In February 2019, the Toledo ended production although sales in selected markets continued well into 2020.

===Special Editions===
====Toledo CONNECT====

The SEAT Toledo CONNECT is part of a special edition line presented at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. This model is equipped with Full Link Technology and a Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone. This allows the user to connect to the car and access connectivity features of the SEAT ConnectApp right on the dashboard.

The SEAT Toledo CONNECT is available in a range of exterior body colours that also allow the mirrors and wheels to be customised. Interior details, including stitching are in blue.

===Critical reception===
The fourth generation of the Toledo received generally negative reviews from critics. In October 2014, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the Toledo on its list of &quot;The Worst Cars You Can Buy Right Now&quot;. &quot;What Car?&quot; awarded it 2 stars out of 5, noting that the Toledo is &quot;at odds with the sporty image SEAT likes to portray its cars as having&quot; while also having a firm ride. Criticism was targeted towards the hard plastics in its interior as well. On the positive side, they&#x27;ve praised the Toledo&#x27;s big boot, rear legroom and frugality. &quot;Autocar&quot; was slightly more positive, awarding it 3 stars out of 5, calling it a &quot;no-nonsense family car&quot;, but criticised its driver appeal and bland design.
==Sales and production figures==
1,019,636 SEAT Toledos have been produced during 4 generations.

The total production per year of SEAT Toledo cars, manufactured in SEAT is shown in the following table.

<text>Jesús Franco Manera (12 May 1930 – 2 April 2013), also commonly known as Jess Franco, was a Spanish filmmaker, composer, and actor, known as a highly prolific director of low-budget exploitation and B-movies. He worked in many different genres during his career, but was best known for his horror and erotic films, often incorporating surrealist elements.

In a career spanning from 1954 to 2013, he wrote, directed, produced, acted in, and scored approximately 173 feature films, working both in his native Spain and (during the rule of Francisco Franco) in France, West Germany, Switzerland and Portugal. Additionally, during the 1960s, he made several films in Rio de Janeiro and Istanbul.

Franco&#x27;s films are known for distinctive visual style and idiosyncratic approach to filmmaking, often directing multiple films concurrently. Despite mixed critical reception during his lifetime, Franco&#x27;s work has gained a dedicated cult following, and he is regarded as a significant figure in the history of exploitation cinema. In 2009, he received an Honorary Goya Award from the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences of Spain for his contributions to Spanish cinema.

== Early life and education ==
Jesús Franco Manera was born in Madrid on 12 May 1930, to a prominent family of Cuban and Mexican origin. His brother, Enrique Franco, was the vice president of the Albéniz Foundation. Via his sister Dolores, Franco was the brother-in-law of philosopher Julián Marías, and the uncle of filmmaker Ricardo Franco.

A lifelong jazz enthusiast and pianist, Franco studied music at the Madrid Royal Conservatory and the Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu, before embarking on a film career. He studied at Madrid&#x27;s Instituto de Investigaciones y Experiencias Cinematográficas, and the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques in Paris. He cited among his influences Luis Buñuel, Stanley Donen, Vincente Minnelli, and Orson Welles.

During this time, he supported himself by working as a pianist in nightclubs and writing pulp novels under the pen name &#x27;David Khune&#x27;, which he later adopted as one of his directing aliases. He also directed stage plays.

==Career==
Franco began his career in 1954 (aged 24) as an assistant director in the Spanish film industry, performing many tasks including composing music for some films as well as co-writing a number of the screenplays. He assisted directors such as Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent, León Klimovsky and Juan Antonio Bardem. After working on more than 20 films for other directors, he decided to get into directing films himself in 1959, making a few musicals and a crime drama called &quot;Red Lips&quot;.

In 1960, Franco took Marius Lesoeur and Sergio Newman, two producer friends, to a cinema to see the newly released Hammer horror film &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; and the three men decided to go into the horror film business. His career took off in 1962 with &quot;The Awful Dr. Orloff&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Gritos en la noche&quot;), which received wide distribution in the USA and the United Kingdom. Franco wrote and directed &quot;Orloff&quot;, and even supplied some of the music for the film. In the mid-1960s, he went on to direct two other horror films, then proceeded to turn out a number of James Bond-like spy thrillers and softcore sex films based on the works of the Marquis de Sade (which remained one of his major influences throughout his career).

Although he had some American box office success with &quot;Necronomicon - Geträumte Sünden&quot; (1968), &quot;99 Women&quot; (1969) and two 1969 Christopher Lee films – &quot;The Bloody Judge&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; – he never achieved wide commercial success. Many of his films were only distributed in Europe, and most of them were never dubbed into English.

=== With Soledad Miranda ===
After discovering Soledad Miranda (he first used her in his film &quot;Count Dracula&quot;), Franco moved from Spain to France in 1969 so that he could make more violent and erotic films free of the strict censorship in Spain at the time, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with an accent on adult material. Miranda starred in a series of six erotic thrillers for Franco, all made within a one-year period (one of which &quot;Sex Charade&quot; was never released), after which she was killed in a tragic automobile accident in Portugal in 1970 just as her career was taking off. She and Franco had started filming her next project (&quot;Justine&quot;) which he abandoned entirely after her death. (Only about 40 minutes of the movie was shot at the time of her death). He had also planned to feature her in his next film, &quot;X312: Flight to Hell&quot;, which he made with another actress.

=== With Lina Romay ===
A year or two after Miranda died, a grieving Franco discovered a new leading lady in actress Lina Romay. At the time, the teenage Romay was married to a young actor/photographer named Ramon Ardid (aka &quot;Raymond Hardy&quot;), who co-starred with Lina in 19 Franco films in the 1970s. But as Romay and Franco became more involved in their film projects together over the years, her marriage to Ardid broke up in 1975 and ended in divorce in 1978 (Ardid continued working with Franco however until 1979).

Franco in adult film &quot;Sexorcismes&quot; (1975) was involved in a non-simulated sex scene with Romay.

Franco was married at the time to Nicole Guettard (their marriage running approximately from 1962 to 1980), Ms. Guettard being gradually replaced in Franco&#x27;s life by Romay. Guettard worked as a script consultant on some of Franco&#x27;s films while they were married (sometimes credited as Nicole Franco), and even acted in a few of them. Her daughter from an earlier marriage, Caroline Riviere, also acted in a few Franco films in the early 1970s (including the risqué &quot;Exorcisme&quot; and &quot;The Perverse Countess&quot;). Guettard died in 1996.

Franco and Romay worked together for 40 years, and lived together from 1980 onward, although they were only &quot;officially&quot; married on 25 April 2008. Until her death in 2012 (from cancer, aged 57), Romay was his most regular actress, as well as his life companion and muse. Romay starred in approximately 109 Jesús Franco films, more than any other actor or actress. Although Romay was listed in the credits of several films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, although she never actually co-directed any of their films together.

Although he produced a number of relatively successful horror films in the early 1970s (&quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Bare-Breasted Countess&quot;, &quot;A Virgin Among the Living Dead&quot;), many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began turning out (even his 1970s horror films featured abundant nudity). Franco returned to low-budget horror films in a brief comeback period from 1980 to 1983 (&quot;Mondo Cannibale&quot;, &quot;Bloody Moon&quot;, &quot;Oasis of the Zombies&quot;, &quot;Mansion of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;Revenge in the House of Usher&quot;), but after 1983, his career took a second downturn as he returned to making mostly pornographic films, most of which left nothing to the imagination.

In his later years, he did, however, get the opportunity to turn out two rather big-budget horror films – &quot;Faceless&quot; (1988) and &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; (1996) – both of which showed what great work he could still do when his projects were adequately funded. The entirety of his work after 1996 (beginning with &quot;Tender Flesh&quot;) was shot-on-video films of very low quality, none of which were distributed theatrically. Romay died of cancer in 2012 at age 57, after which Franco died on April 2, 2013, from natural causes at age 82.

===&quot;Zombie Lake&quot; vs. &quot;Oasis of the Zombies&quot;===
Franco was supposed to write and direct a film for Eurocine Productions in 1980 called &quot;Lake of the Living Dead&quot; (a horror film about revived Nazi zombies) but after submitting the basic plot summary, he fell out with the producers, Marius and Daniel Lesoeur, over the ridiculously low budget he was allotted, and the producers immediately hired French horror film director Jean Rollin to direct it (later re-titling it &quot;Zombie Lake&quot;).

The Lesoeurs later had Rollin shoot new (zombie) footage in 1981 to be added to Franco&#x27;s &quot;A Virgin Among the Living Dead&quot; (1973) for its 1981 theatrical rerelease. Franco&#x27;s original director&#x27;s cut of the film was later made available on DVD.

Franco later directed another film for the Lesouers called &quot;Oasis of the Zombies&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies&quot; on VHS) in 1981, which had a plot very similar to &quot;Zombie Lake&quot; (also involving revived Nazi zombies). It was released in France as &quot;The Abyss of the Living Dead&quot;. Franco simultaneously shot a variant Spanish-language version of &quot;Oasis of the Zombies&quot; at the producers&#x27; expense, starring Lina Romay and his &quot;regulars&quot;, which was apparently released only in Spain in 1982 as &quot;La Tumba de los Muertos Vivientes&quot;.

==Filmmaking style and themes==
Franco sometimes worked under various pseudonyms, including David Khune and Frank Hollmann. A fan of jazz music (and a musician himself), many of his pseudonyms were taken from jazz musicians such as Clifford Brown and James P. Johnson.

Franco&#x27;s themes often revolved around lesbian vampires, women in prison, surgical horror, sadomasochism, zombies and sexploitation (including numerous films based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade). He worked in other exploitation film genres, such as cannibal films, spy films, giallo, crime films, science fiction, jungle adventure, Oriental menace, exorcist films, war movies, historical dramas and nunsploitation. His sex movies often contained long, uninterrupted shots of nude women writhing around on beds. Most of his hardcore films starred his lifelong companion Lina Romay (sometimes billed as &quot;Candy Coster&quot; or &quot;Lulu Laverne&quot;), who admitted in interviews to being an exhibitionist.

Franco was known for his use of a hand-held camera and zoom shots, which he felt lent realism to his films. He also was not averse to filming several movies at the same time, knocking together a second feature on the unsuspecting producer&#x27;s dime. Many of his actors only found out years after the fact that Franco had actually starred them in films for which they had never even been paid.

His main claim to fame, however, is that he managed to direct approximately 173 motion pictures in his lifetime, encompassing a wide swathe of different genres with practically no financial backing available to him. (Note: Some sources which list as many as 200 titles in Franco&#x27;s filmography are relisting the same films several times under their different variant titles.)

Sometimes referred to as the &quot;European Ed Wood&quot;, Franco similarly attracted a circle of bizarre but loyal actors and technicians who moved with him over the years from project to project (while receiving very little, if any, money for their efforts). Many of his actors were over-the-hill performers in the twilight of their careers, many of his actresses brazen exhibitionists. He frequently worked with genre actors Lina Romay (who appeared in 109 Franco films), Antonio Mayans (who appeared in 50 Franco films), Howard Vernon (who appeared in 40 Franco films), Paul Müller (who appeared in 15 Franco films), Monica Swinn (who appeared in 15 Franco films), and Christopher Lee (who appeared in 7 Franco films). His frequent cast members also included Jack Taylor, Ewa Strömberg, Anne Libert, Soledad Miranda, Maria Rohm, William Berger, Dennis Price, Olivier Mathot, Muriel Montosse (a.k.a. Victoria Adams), Alice Arno, Montserrat Prous, Alberto Dalbés, Britt Nichols, Pamela Stanford, Mabel Escaño, Kali Hansa, Carmen Carrión and Klaus Kinski, all of whom are well known to Euro horror film historians.

== Death ==
Franco suffered a severe stroke on 27 March 2013, and was taken to a hospital in Málaga, Spain, where he died six days later, on the morning of 2 April. He was 82.

<text>General Motors Local Area Network (GMLAN) is an application- and transport-layer protocol using controller area network for lower layer services. It was standardized as SAE J2411 for use in OBD-II vehicle networks.

==Transport-layer services==
Transport-layer services include the transmission of multi-CAN-frame messages based on the ISO 15765-2 multi-frame messaging scheme. It was developed and is used primarily by General Motors for in-vehicle communication and diagnostics. GM&#x27;s Tech2 uses the CANdi (Controller Area Network diagnostic interface) adapter to communicate over GMLAN.

==Applications==
Some software applications that allow interfacing to GMLAN are Intrepid Control Systems, Inc.&#x27;s Vehicle Spy 3; Vector&#x27;s CANoe; Dearborn Group&#x27;s Hercules, ETAS&#x27; ES-1222, ES590, ES715, and ES580; ScanTool.net&#x27;s OBDLink MX; EControls by Enovation Controls&#x27; CANCapture; and GMLAN vehicle universal remote control GMRC for Android devices

Tesla uses J2411 (single-wire CAN over the Control Pilot) for their DC Supercharger (newer units are also capable of PLC over the control pilot) and AC Destination Charging.

<text>Melanosuchus is a genus of caiman. The genus is most commonly referred to as the &quot;Black Caimans&quot;. The black caiman of South America is the sole extant (living) species, and is the largest living member of the subfamily Caimaninae, as well as the entire alligator family Alligatoridae.

==Taxonomy==
There are two known valid species of &quot;Melanosuchus&quot;, one extant and one extinct:
*&quot;Melanosuchus niger&quot; – known as the Black caiman, native to the Amazon basin of South America
*&quot;Melanosuchus latrubessei&quot; – discovered in the Solimões Formation of Brazil, dating from the Upper Miocene

&quot;Melanosuchus fisheri&quot;, named by Medina in 1976, from the Late Miocene Urumaco Formation of Venezuela is sometimes considered as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, and possibly synonymous with &quot;Melanosuchus niger&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
&quot;Melanosuchus&quot; is a member of the subfamily Caimaninae, which contains the two other extant genera &quot;Caiman&quot; and &quot;Paleosuchus&quot;, all of which are native to South and Central America. The below cladogram shows the relationships of all extant genera within Crocodilia (excluding separate extinct taxa), based on molecular phylogenetic studies.

<text>The Rowperfect is an indoor rowing machine, designed in 1987 and patented in 1988, by Casper (Cas) Rekers. It is designed to accurately simulate the feeling of rowing on the water. Both the flywheel and the seat are free to move on a slide — this is different from the majority of rowing machines, where the flywheel is fixed and only the seat moves. Its mass and movement are balanced and engineered to enable rowing technique to be learned and refined. This is called a &quot;floating head&quot; rowing simulator: the fixed flywheel type is called a &quot;fixed head&quot; ergometer.

The result is that the flywheel moves towards the rower on the recovery, mimicking the on-water experience of the boat moving under the rower more accurately. The Rowperfect is also unusual in offering a limited tilt seat, which compels the rower to control their weight distribution during the power stroke and recovery. It is considered to be a useful aide to teaching rowing.

== Manufacture ==
Two versions of the successor to the original Rowperfect exist that are made by: Care RP3 in the Netherlands and Rowperfect Pty in Australia. Both versions are able to hook up to dedicated software independently developed and marketed by Row-Ware, including SEAN.

Rowperfect Pty Ltd. bought Rowperfect BV in 2004 moving development and production to Australia, developing the lowered flywheel position of the Indoor Sculler during that process. Rowperfect Pty Ltd holds US Patent 8,608,626 covering the lowered flywheel position on the moving mainframe. After multiple prototypes (the first produced in January 2005) the first Indoor Sculler was produced in June 2008.

The Dutch company produced its rowing machine, the RP3, from June 2009.

Rowperfect Pty Ltd builds the Indoor Sculler, which has a specialised monitor readouts of output power, time, rating, meters distance per stroke, heartrate, power per heartbeat, stroke length. Outputs are calibrated to athlete weight and boat class and give readings aligned to on-water times for skilled athletes. The Indoor Sculler was intensively tested on the domestic market in Australia prior to export to North America, South Africa and Europe.

The Rowperfect Indoor Sculler contains 18 kg of solid stainless steel. The bar, legs and seat base are all solid stainless steel, as are all internal axles and fittings in the moving main frame. By using lightweight materials such as Aluminium and ABS Plastic, the dynamic mainframe of the Indoor Sculler is specifically manufactured to the target weight of 17 kg, replicating the mass per rower (including oars/sculls) of Single, Double and Quad sculling boats as well as the Coxless Pair and the Coxless Four (note: an eight has a 19 kg per-rower mass).

Care RP3 builds the RP3 Computer software shows a force curve, joules, stroke length, stroke rate as well as time, rating, 500 m split and meters. Weight adjusted scores and rowing boat class selection enable coaches to assess likely on-water times for crews based on the computer readouts. Used by Olympic athletes in both sculling and sweep disciplines including Mahé Drysdale, Alan Campbell and crews from US Rowing and New Zealand.

Both machines led rival manufacturers to develop dynamic indoor rowing machines during 2010 leading to a change in perception and adoption.

== Users and coaches ==
Harry Mahon was the first international rowing coach to use Rowperfect widely with his crews. Greg Searle&#x27;s force curve is illustrated in The Sport of Rowing Book. Further force curves Harry developed for coaches to download and use.

USRowing adopted the RP3 as one of their training tools during Timothy McLaren&#x27;s tenure as head coach. Since that time, the University of Washington crews have used RP and dominated the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championship regatta. Harvard University rowing crews recently acquired RPs under Charlie Butt&#x27;s coaching direction.

Other known international users since 2012 include Rowing New Zealand, Dansk Forening for Rosport, Royal Dutch Rowing Federation, British Rowing coach, Robin Williams.

<doc id="1176191" wikidata="Q1999018" url="?curid=1176191" title="VC-1">
<text>SMPTE 421, informally known as VC-1, is a video coding format. Most of it was initially developed as Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary video format Windows Media Video 9 in 2003. With some enhancements including the development of a new Advanced Profile, it was officially approved as an SMPTE standard on April 3, 2006. It was primarily marketed as a lower-complexity competitor to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard. After its development, several companies other than Microsoft asserted that they held patents that applied to the technology, including Panasonic, LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics.

VC-1 is supported in the now-deprecated Microsoft Silverlight, the briefly-offered HD DVD disc format, and the Blu-ray Disc format.

==Format==
VC-1 is an evolution of the conventional block-based motion-compensated hybrid video coding design also found in H.261, MPEG-1 Part 2, H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.263, and MPEG-4 Part 2. It was widely characterized as an alternative to the ITU-T and MPEG video codec standard known as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. The Advanced Profile of VC-1 contains tools designed for coding interlaced video sequences as well as progressive scan video. The main goal of the development and standardization of the VC-1 Advanced Profile was to support interlace-optimized compression of interlaced content without first converting it to progressive scan, making it more attractive to broadcast and video industry professionals using the 1080i format.

Both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc adopted VC-1 as a supported video format, meaning their video playback devices are required to be capable of decoding and playing video-content compressed using VC-1. Windows Vista partially supports HD DVD playback by including the VC-1 decoder and some related components needed for playback of VC-1 encoded HD DVD movies.

Microsoft designated VC-1 as the Xbox 360 video game console&#x27;s official video format, and game developers could use VC-1 for full motion video included with games. By means of an October 31, 2006 update, all formats of Windows Media Video could be played on the Xbox 360 from a disc, USB storage device, or streaming from a PC via Windows Media Connect/Windows Media Player 11.

VC-1 is supported in the PlayStation 3 console and the FFmpeg project also includes a VC-1 decoder.

On August 24, 2012, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced hardware decoding support for VC-1.

==Microsoft codec implementations==
The VC-1 codec specification has so far been implemented by Microsoft in the form of three codecs, each identified with a unique four character code.

===WMV3===
The Simple and Main Profiles of VC-1 remained completely faithful to the existing WMV3 implementation, making WMV3 bitstreams fully VC-1 compliant.
The WMV3 codec was designed to primarily support progressive encoding for computer displays. An interlaced encoding mode was implemented, but quickly became deprecated when Microsoft started implementing WMV Advanced Profile. Whereas WMV3 progressive encoding was implemented using the YUV 4:2:0 color sampling scheme, the deprecated interlaced mode was implemented using the less common YUV 4:1:1 sampling scheme.

The Windows Media Video 9 (WMV3) codec implements the Simple and Main modes of the VC-1 codec standard, providing high-quality video for streaming and downloading. &quot;It provides support for a wide range of bit rates, from high-definition content at one-half to one-third the bit rate of MPEG-2, to low-bit-rate Internet video delivered over a dial-up modem. This codec also supports professional-quality downloadable video with two-pass and variable bit rate (VBR) encoding.&quot;

A number of high definition movies and videos have been released commercially in a format dubbed WMV HD. These titles are encoded with WMV3 Main Profile @ High Level (MP@HL).

===WMVA===
WMVA was the original implementation of WMV Advanced Profile prior to the acceptance of the VC-1 draft by SMPTE. The codec was distributed with Windows Media Player 10 and Windows Media Format SDK 9.5 install packages. There are slight bitstream differences between WMVA and WVC1, so consequently WMVA is handled by a different DirectShow decoder than WVC1. Some 3rd party hardware and software decoders only decode WMVA based content. As of 2006, WMVA is considered a deprecated codec because it is not fully VC-1 compliant.

===WVC1===
WVC1, also known as Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile, implements a more recent and fully compliant Advanced Profile of the VC-1 codec standard. It offers support for interlaced content and is transport independent. With the previous version of the Windows Media Video 9 Series codec, users could deliver progressive content at data rates as low as one-third that of the MPEG-2 codec and still get equivalent or comparable quality to MPEG-2. The Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile codec also offers this same improvement in encoding efficiency with interlaced contents. A decoder for WVC1 is included in Windows Media Player 11, which is bundled with Windows Vista and is available as a download for Windows XP. This implementation is supported in Microsoft Silverlight.

==Profiles==
==Bit rates and resolutions==
==Other implementations==
Due to its origins in Microsoft&#x27;s WMV9 codec, the most popular implementations of VC-1 encoders have so far been done by Microsoft, though third-party implementations exist as well. Sonic Cinevision PSE, a professional VC-1 encoding tool used predominantly in HD DVD and Blu-ray encoding, is a commercial version of Microsoft&#x27;s PEP (Parallel Encoder) encoding tool and VC-1 Analyzer tool. Microsoft owns the code development whereas Sonic Solutions owns the sales and distribution. Microsoft also provides a separate VC-1 Encoder SDK which allows any company or software developer to integrate VC-1 encoding into their applications.
Non-Microsoft VC-1 implementations (based entirely on the SMPTE specifications) have been done by Ericsson Television and MainConcept. The FFmpeg project includes a free VC-1 decoder.

==Encoding software==
Windows Media Encoder 9 Series encodes VC-1 compliant video files, including WVC1 FourCC media. Windows Media Format 11 Runtime or Windows Media Player 11 must be installed on the computer to ensure full VC-1 compliance across all three profiles (Simple, Main and Advanced). If either of these are installed, Windows Movie Maker can also save VC-1 compliant videos, as can any other application built on the Windows Media Format SDK or Windows Media Codec DMOs. A Windows Media Encoder Studio Edition was initially announced for professional encoding but later cancelled by Microsoft. Microsoft Expression Encoder which is part of Expression Studio supports encoding VC-1 video to the Windows Media (ASF) file format and the IIS Smooth Streaming format.

Video encoder products made by Inlet, Digital Rapids, Harmonic, Envivio, Elemental Technologies, Anystream, Telestream and Rhozet support VC-1 encoding (based on the Microsoft VC-1 Encoder SDK) for IPTV and Web streaming.

== Hardware-based encoding and decoding ==

Because VC-1 encoding and decoding requires significant computing power, software implementation that run on a general-purpose CPU are typically slow, especially when dealing with HD video content. To reduce CPU usage or to do real-time encoding, special-purpose hardware may be employed, either for the complete encoding or decoding process, or for acceleration assistance within a CPU-controlled environment. A hardware VC-1 encoder can be an ASIC or an FPGA.

Hardware-accelerated (also known as hardware-assisted) video decoding can either be done on dedicated, special-purpose hardware or on generic, multi-purpose hardware such as GPUs. The former is typically found in consumer electronics devices such as Blu-ray Disc players and 3G/4G mobile phones, while the latter is typically found in PCs. Nearly all video cards manufactured since 2006 support some level of GPU-accelerated VC-1 decoding on the Windows platform via DirectX Video Acceleration APIs. The native Windows WMV9/VC-1 decoder (wmvdecod.dll) only supports DXVA profiles A, B and C, while 3rd party VC-1 decoders such as CyberLink&#x27;s support the full DXVA Profile D decode acceleration. There is no support for GPU-accelerated VC-1 decode on the MacOS platform.

Raspberry Pi hardware prior to Raspberry Pi 4 supports VC-1 hardware-accelerated decoding, although it requires purchasing of a license key.

== Legal status ==
Although heavily associated with Microsoft, there are 18 member companies within the VC-1 patent pool. The majority of patents are held by four companies: Microsoft (324 patents), Panasonic (122 patents), LG Electronics (96 patents), and Samsung Electronics (96 patents).

As an SMPTE standard, VC-1 is open to implementation by anyone, although implementers may be required to pay licensing fees to the MPEG LA, the LLC licensing body or directly to its members, who claim to hold essential patents on the format (since it is a non-exclusive licensing body).

Over 92.9% of the patents have expired as of November 26, 2024.

=== Patent holders ===
The following organizations hold one or more patents in the VC-1 patent pool, as listed by MPEG LA.

<text>Amorbach () is a town in the Miltenberg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany, with some 4,000 inhabitants. It is situated on the small river Mud, in the northeastern part of the Odenwald.

== History ==
The town began as a Benedictine monastery (Amorbach Abbey or &quot;Kloster Amorbach&quot;), which bit by bit grew into a settlement until in 1253 it was raised to the status of a town. Over the years, the town changed hands several times. It was part of the Bishopric of Würzburg until 1656, when it became part of the Archbishopric of Mainz. As a result of the 1803 German Mediatisation the Archbishopric of Mainz was secularized, and Amorbach became the residence town of the short-lived Principality of Leiningen. Only in 1816 did it become part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1965, Amorbach attained the status of a climatic spa (&quot;Luftkurort&quot;).

=== Amalgamations ===
The following settlements have been amalgamated with the town:
* 1 April 1973: Boxbrunn
* 1 January 1975: Beuchen
* 1 January 1976: Neudorf
* 1 January 1976: Reichartshausen

==Economy==
Today Amorbach relies on the tourist business with its state recognition as a climatic spa (&quot;Luftkurort&quot;) and its many Baroque buildings.

Amorbach is the family seat of the princely &quot;Haus zu Leiningen&quot;. In 1992, the town was awarded the Europa Nostra Medal.

== Arts and culture==

=== Abbey church===

The Benedictine abbey, formerly owned by the princely &quot;Haus zu Leiningen&quot; with its library, and the abbey church with its Stumm organ draw thousands of visitors each year.

===Parish church St. Gangolf===

The late-Baroque hall church replaced an earlier one, St. Gangolf and St. Sebastian, documented for 1182. It was built in 1751-3 by local &quot;Oberamtmann&quot; Johann Franz Wolfgang Damian von Ostein and his brother and Archbishop, Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein. The design was based on plans by Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn, building work was supervised by his apprentice Alexander Jakob Schmidt. The design was inspired by St. Peter&#x27;s Church at Mainz. The interior reflects Rococo style and the onset of the Neoclassical style. Ceiling frescoes by Johannes Zick show the lives of St. Gangolf (Gangulphus) and Saint Sebastian as well as King David as the &quot;father&quot; of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. Oil paintings in the choir by depict the legendary beginnings of Amorbach. The marble high altar was made by Georg Schrantz, while Josef Keilwerth added the four statues. The cross by J.B. Berg dates from 1808. The side altars (1720) were originally used in the predecessor building. The organ also dates from 1720, but was located at Neustadt am Main Abbey until 1806, when it was bought by the Amorbach parish. The church has two pulpits, made from stucco by Antonio Rossi.

St. Gangolf is the Catholic parish church of Amorbach.

=== Museums ===
The &quot;Sammlung Berger mit Teekannenmuseum&quot; is a museum of art and teapots. Besides impressive exhibits of modern art by Arman, Michael Buthe, Chagall, Christo, Keith Haring, Otto Reichart, Rebecca Horn, Yves Klein, Roy Lichtenstein, Nam June Paik, Niki de Saint-Phalle, H. A. Schult, Daniel Spoerri, Ben Vautier, Dick Higgins and others, the museum also shows a teapot collection of 2,467 teapots from throughout the world and roughly 500 miniature teapots.

===Tithe barn===
The tithe barn in Amorbach, built in 1488, has for five hundred years played a central role in the town. Originally built to store tithes in the form of produce for the prince, it was – after extensive remodelling in the 1960s – run as a cinema.

The &quot;Kulturkreis Zehntscheuer Amorbach e.V.&quot; (“Amorbach Tithe Barn Cultural Circle”), which outfitted the building in 1991 as a cabaret theatre maintains and renovates the building, which stands in the historical town centre. In 2001, this club bought the tithe barn.

=== Regular events ===

*Amorbach Abbey Concerts in the former Benedictine abbey church
*Cabaret programme at the cabaret theatre &quot;Zehntscheuer Amorbach&quot;
*Daily at 12:00 and 15:00, the Stumm organ (1782) with its 5,116 pipes is played
*Each year on Mother’s Day, the so-called &quot;Gangolfsritt&quot; (“Gangulphus’s Ride”), a procession of horses through the town, takes place.

==Life and career==

Jill Larson, who succeeded Lyman in the role of Opal on &quot;All My Children&quot;, and she attended the same high school. She debuted on her first soap opera, &quot;A World Apart&quot;, as flower child Julie Stark in 1971. Several years later, Dorothy appeared as Elly Jo Jamison, an evil relation of wealthy Orin Hillyer&#x27;s, (1972-1973) on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, and as architect Gwen Parrish Frame (1976–1980, 1989) on &quot;Another World&quot;.

Her most notable soap opera role, though, was on &quot;All My Children&quot; as Opal Sue Gardner (1981-1983), for which she received two Emmy Awards—as Outstanding Actress in a Supporting Role in a Daytime Drama Series in 1982 and for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series in 1983. Lyman performed characters on other soap operas including Rebecca Whitmore (1990–1991)&quot; on Generations&quot;, and Bonnie Roberts (1991–1992) on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

In 1983, Lyman became well known for her role as Naomi Harper on the sitcom &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, a role she played for the full six seasons. In an appearance on Vicki Lawrence&#x27;s talk show &quot;Vicki!&quot;, Lyman noted that she continued to perform on &quot;All My Children&quot; concurrently with the beginning of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;&#x27;s production, flying back and forth each week between New York City and Los Angeles. While the commute was brutal, she remembered it fondly, referring to that stage of her career as &quot;All My Paychecks&quot;.

During this time, Lyman appeared in the &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; television series in the &quot;In the Cards&quot; episode (1985). She also played Ralphie&#x27;s mother in Jean Shepherd&#x27;s &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot; from 1988, appeared in &quot;ALF&quot; as Maura Norris in the episode &quot;Tequila&quot; (1988), and in &quot;Hunter&quot; as Sgt. Carol James Meyers in the episode &quot;The Pit&quot; (1989).

When &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; ended its run in 1990, Lyman went behind the camera, producing and directing 75 episodes of &quot;The Nanny&quot; (all episodes of the third and fourth seasons, and all but four episodes of the fifth), even making a special guest appearance on the Fran Drescher sitcom. Lyman also had a recurring role on &quot;Bob&quot;, Bob Newhart&#x27;s third series.

On the big screen, she made a cameo appearance in &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;, a film starring Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts. She made another cameo appearance in the 2001 film &quot;Blow&quot; starring Johnny Depp. She was seen in the 2006 films &quot;World Trade Center&quot; and &quot;The Departed&quot;.

In 2007, Lyman guest-starred in the third season of the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; as Starbuck&#x27;s mother. She made a guest appearance on &quot;Reba&quot;, playing the titular character&#x27;s mother. She appeared in &quot;The Blacklist&quot; in the season-six episode &quot;The Pawnbrokers&quot;.

Lyman performed &quot;My Kitchen Wars&quot; in Hollywood and New York as a one-woman show based on the book by Betty Fussell.

==Personal life==
From 1971 to 1983, Lyman was married to director and actor John Tillinger; they have two children, including daughter Emma Tillinger Koskoff, who is an Academy Awards-nominated producer. Her son, Sebastian Tillinger, is an actor. From her second marriage to French film producer Vincent Malle, Lyman has a son.
