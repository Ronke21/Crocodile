<text> () are ethnic Koreans who immigrated to Japan before 1945 and are citizens or permanent residents of Japan, or who are descendants of those immigrants. They are a group distinct from South Korean nationals who have immigrated to Japan since the end of World War II and the division of Korea.

They currently constitute the third largest ethnic minority group in Japan after Chinese immigrants. Their population declined significantly due to death, returning to Korea, and assimilating into the general Japanese population. The majority of Koreans in Japan are , often known simply as , who are ethnic Korean permanent residents of Japan. The term Zainichi Korean refers only to long-term Korean residents of Japan who trace their roots to Korea under Japanese rule, distinguishing them from the later wave of Korean migrants who came mostly in the 1980s, and from pre-modern immigrants dating back to antiquity who may themselves be the ancestors of the Japanese people.

The Japanese word &quot;Zainichi&quot; itself means a foreign citizen &quot;staying in Japan&quot;, and implies temporary residence. Nevertheless, the term &quot;Zainichi Korean&quot; is used to describe settled permanent residents of Japan, both those who have retained their Joseon or North Korean/South Korean nationalities, and even sometimes includes Japanese citizens of Korean descent who acquired Japanese nationality by naturalization or by birth from one or both parents who have Japanese citizenship.

==Statistics==
According to the Ministry of Justice, 410,156 South Koreans and 24,305 North were registered as permanent or non-permanent residents of Japan in 2023. Below, two statistics on the numbers of foreign residents living in Japan are displayed, one map and one chart:

==History==

===Overview===
The modern flow of Koreans to Japan started with the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876 and increased dramatically after 1920. During World War II, a large number of Koreans were also conscripted by Japan. Another wave of migration started after South Korea was devastated by the Korean War in the 1950s. Also noteworthy was the large number of refugees from the massacres on Jeju Island by the South Korean government.

Statistics regarding Zainichi immigration are scarce. However, in 1988, a Mindan youth group called Zainihon Daikan Minkoku Seinendan (, ) published a report titled, &quot;Father, tell us about that day. Report to reclaim our history&quot; (). The report included a survey of first generation Koreans&#x27; reasons for immigration. The result was 13.3% for conscription, 39.6% for economics, 17.3% for marriage and family, 9.5% for study/academic, 20.2% for other reasons and 0.2% unknown. The survey excluded those who were under 12 when they arrived in Japan.

===Pre-modern era===
While some families can currently trace their ancestry back to pre-modern Korean immigrants, many families were absorbed into Japanese society and as a result, they are not considered a distinct group. The same is applicable to those families which are descended from Koreans who entered Japan in subsequent periods of pre-modern Japanese history. Trade with Korea continued to modern times, with Japan also periodically receiving missions from Korea, though this activity was often limited to specific ports.

====Yayoi period====
In late prehistory, in the Iron Age Yayoi period (300 BCE to 300 CE), Japanese culture some Korean influence, though whether this was accompanied by immigration from Korea is debated (see Origin of the Yayoi people).

==== Kofun period (250 to 538) ====
In the later Kofun (250–538 CE) and Asuka (538–710 CE) periods, there was some flow of people from the Korean Peninsula, both as immigrants and long-term visitors, notably a number of clans in the Kofun period (see Kofun period Korean migration). While some families today can ultimately trace their ancestry to the immigrants, they were generally absorbed into Japanese society and are not considered a distinct modern group.

==== Heian period (794 to 1185) ====
According to the Nihon Kōki historical text, in 814, six people, including a Silla man called Karanunofurui (, Japanese: 加羅布古伊; presumed to be of gaya descent) became naturalized in Japan&#x27;s Minokuni (美濃國) region.

==== Sengoku period (1467 to 1615) ====
Some Koreans entered Japan in captivity as a result of pirate raids or during the 15921598 Japanese invasions of Korea.

==== Edo period (1603 to 1867) ====
In the Edo period, trade with Korea occurred through the Tsushima-Fuchū Domain in Kyūshū, near Nagasaki.

===Before World War II===
After the conclusion of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876, Korean students and asylum seekers started to come to Japan, including Korean politicians and activists Bak Yeonghyo, Kim Ok-gyun, and Song Byeong-jun. There were about 800 Koreans living in Japan before Japan annexed Korea. In 1910, as the result of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty, Japan annexed Korea, and all Korean people became part of the nation of the Empire of Japan by law and received Japanese citizenship.

In the 1920s, the demand for labor in Japan was high while Koreans had difficulty finding jobs in the Korean peninsula. As a result, thousands of Koreans migrated or were recruited to work in industries like coal mining. A majority of the immigrants consisted of farmers from the southern part of Korea. The number of Koreans in Japan in 1930 was more than ten times greater than that of 1920, reaching 419,000. However, the jobs they could get on the mainland of Japan were curtailed by open discrimination and largely limited to physical labor due to their poor education; they usually worked alongside other groups of ethnic minorities subject to discrimination, such as &quot;burakumin&quot;.

Before World War II, the Japanese government tried to reduce the number of Koreans immigrating to Japan. To accomplish this, the Japanese government devoted resources to the Korean peninsula.

===During World War II===

In 1939, the Japanese government introduced the National Mobilization Law and conscripted Koreans to deal with labor shortages due to World War II. In 1944, the Japanese authorities extended the mobilization of Japanese civilians for labor on the Korean peninsula. Of the 5,400,000 Koreans conscripted, about 670,000 were taken to mainland Japan (including Karafuto Prefecture, present-day Sakhalin, now part of Russia) for civilian labor. Those who were brought to Japan were forced to work in factories, in mines, and as laborers, often under appalling conditions. About 60,000 are estimated to have died between 1939 and 1945. Most of the wartime laborers returned home after the war, but some elected to remain in Japan. 43,000 of those in Karafuto, which had been occupied by the Soviet Union just before Japan&#x27;s surrender, were refused repatriation to either mainland Japan or the Korean Peninsula, and were thus trapped in Sakhalin, stateless; they became the ancestors of the Sakhalin Koreans.

===After World War II===
Koreans entered Japan illegally post-World War II due to an unstable political and economic situation in Korea, with 20,000 to 40,000 Koreans fleeing Syngman Rhee&#x27;s forces during the Jeju uprising in 1948. The Yeosu-Suncheon rebellion also increased the illegal immigration to Japan. It is estimated that between 1946 and 1949, 90% of illegal immigrants to Japan were Koreans. During the Korean War, Korean immigrants came to Japan to avoid torture or murder at the hands of dictator Syngman Rhee&#x27;s forces (e.g., in the Bodo League massacre).

Fishers and brokers helped immigrants enter Japan through Tsushima Island. In the 1950s, Japan Coast Guard secured the border with Korea, but apprehending illegal immigrants was difficult because they were armed, while Japan Coast Guard was not due to the terms of the surrender of Japan after World War II. During this period, one-fifth of the immigrants were arrested.

In Official Correspondence of 1949, Shigeru Yoshida, the prime minister of Japan, proposed the deportation of all Zainichi Koreans to Douglas MacArthur, the American Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, and said the Japanese government would pay all of the cost. Yoshida stated that it was unfair for Japan to purchase food for illegal Zainichi Koreans, claiming that they did not contribute to the Japanese economy and that they supposedly committed political crimes by cooperating with communists.

===Loss of Japanese nationality===

Immediately following the end of World War II, there were roughly 2.4 million Koreans in Japan; the majority repatriated to their ancestral homes in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, leaving only 650,000 in Japan by 1946.

Japan&#x27;s defeat in the war and the end of its colonization of the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan left the nationality status of Koreans and Taiwanese in an ambiguous position in terms of law. The of 2 May 1947 ruled that Koreans and some Taiwanese were to be provisionally treated as foreign nationals. Given the lack of a single, unified government on the Korean Peninsula, Koreans were provisionally registered under the name of &quot;Joseon&quot; (, Japanese: &quot;Chōsen&quot;, ), the old name of undivided Korea.

In 1948, the northern and southern parts of Korea declared independence individually, making &quot;Joseon&quot;, or the old undivided Korea, a defunct nation. The new government of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) made a request to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, then the occupying power of Japan, to change the nationality registration of Zainichi Koreans to &quot;Daehan Minguk&quot; (; Japanese: &quot;Daikan Minkoku&quot;, ), the official name of the new nation. Following this, from 1950 onwards, Zainichi Koreans were allowed to voluntarily re-register their nationality as such.

The Allied occupation of Japan ended on 28 April 1952 with the San Francisco Peace Treaty, in which Japan formally abandoned its territorial claim to the Korean Peninsula, and as a result, Zainichi Koreans formally lost their Japanese nationality.

The division on the Korean Peninsula led to division among Koreans in Japan. Mindan, the Korean Residents Union in Japan, was set up in 1946 as a pro-South offshoot of Chōren (League of Koreans in Japan), the main Korean residents&#x27; organisation, which had a socialist ideology. Following the May Day riots of 1952, the pro-North organisation was made illegal, but it re-formed under various guises and went on to form the &quot;General Association of Korean Residents in Japan&quot;, or Chongryon, in 1955. This organisation kept to its socialist, and by extension pro-North stance, and enjoyed the active financial support of the North Korean government.
In 1965, Japan concluded a Treaty on Basic Relations with the Republic of Korea and recognized the South Korean government as the only legitimate government of the peninsula. Those Koreans in Japan who did not apply for South Korean citizenship kept Chōsen-seki which did not give them citizenship of any nation.

===Newcomers===

Starting in 1980, South Korea allowed its students to study abroad freely; starting in 1987, people older than forty-four were allowed to travel abroad. One year after the 1988 Seoul Olympics, traveling abroad was further liberalized. When Expo 2005 was held, the Japanese government had a visa waiver program with South Korea for a limited period under the condition that the visitor&#x27;s purpose was sightseeing or business, and later extended it permanently. Korean enclaves tend to exclude newcomers from existing Korean organizations, especially Mindan, so newcomers have created a new one called the .

In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the perception of Zainichi Koreans in Japan, largely influenced by the growing popularity of Korean culture, known as the &quot;Korean Wave&quot;, or Hallyu. This cultural phenomenon, encompassing Korean music, television dramas, films, and cuisine, has gained widespread attention not only in Japan but also globally. As a result, there has been an increased appreciation for Korean culture among the Japanese population, leading to greater interest in Zainichi Koreans and their heritage.

The Korean Wave has played a significant role in bridging cultural gaps and fostering greater acceptance of Zainichi Koreans in Japanese society. K-pop music groups, such as BTS, Twice and BLACKPINK, have garnered massive followings in Japan, garnering interest in Korean entertainment. Similarly, Korean dramas and films have found a dedicated audience in Japan, contributing to the normalization of Korean culture within mainstream Japanese media.

Furthermore, economic opportunities have also contributed to a recent influx of Korean newcomers to Japan. Despite historical tensions between the two countries, Japan remains an attractive destination for many South Koreans seeking employment and business prospects. The close geographical proximity and strong economic ties between Japan and South Korea have facilitated increased migration and investment between the two nations.

Japan&#x27;s aging population and labor shortages in certain industries have created demand for foreign workers, including Koreans. Many Korean nationals have sought employment opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing, technology, healthcare, and hospitality, contributing to Japan&#x27;s workforce and economy.

==Repatriation to Korea==

Repatriation of Zainichi Koreans from Japan conducted under the auspices of the Japanese Red Cross began to receive official support from the Japanese government as early as 1956. A North Korean-sponsored repatriation programme with support of the Chōsen Sōren (The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) officially began in 1959. In April 1959, ( &quot;Terao Gorō&quot;), a political activist and historian of the Japanese Communist Party, published the book, &quot;North of the 38th Parallel&quot; (Japanese: ), in which he praised North Korea for its rapid development and humanitarianism. Following its publication, numbers of returnees skyrocketed. The Japanese government was in favour of repatriation as a way to rid the country of ethnic minority residents that were discriminated against and regarded as incompatible with Japanese culture. Though the United States government was initially unaware of Tokyo&#x27;s cooperation with the repatriation programme, they offered no objection after they were informed of it; the US ambassador to Japan was quoted by his Australian counterpart as describing the Koreans in Japan as, &quot;a poor lot including many Communists and many criminals&quot;.

Despite the fact that 97% of the Zainichi Koreans originated from the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, the North was initially a far more popular destination for repatriation than the South. Approximately 70,000 Zainichi repatriated to North Korea during a two-year period from 1960 through 1961. However, as word came back of difficult conditions in the North and with the 1965 normalization of Japan-South Korea relations, the popularity of repatriation to the North dropped sharply, though the trickle of returnees to the North continued as late as 1984. In total, 93,340 people migrated from Japan to North Korea under the repatriation programme; an estimated 6,000 were Japanese migrating with Korean spouses. Around one hundred such repatriates are believed to have later escaped from North Korea; the most famous is Kang Chol-Hwan, who published a book about his experience, &quot;The Aquariums of Pyongyang&quot;. One returnee who later defected back to Japan, known only by his Japanese pseudonym Kenki Aoyama, worked for North Korean intelligence as a spy in Beijing.

The repatriations have been the subject of numerous creative works in Japan, due to the influence they had on the Zainichi Korean community. One documentary film about a family whose sons repatriated while the parents and daughter remained in Japan, &quot;Dear Pyongyang&quot;, won a special jury prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.

Some Zainichi Koreans have gone to South Korea to study or to settle. For example, author Lee Yangji studied at Seoul National University in the early 1980s.

==Organizations – Chongryon and Mindan==

===Division between Chongryon and Mindan===
Well into at least the 1970s, Chongryon was the dominant Zainichi group, and in some ways remains more politically significant today in Japan. However, the widening disparity between the political and economic conditions of the two Koreas has since made Mindan, the pro-South Korean group, the larger and less politically controversial faction. 65% of Zainichi are now said to be affiliated to Mindan. The number of pupils receiving ethnic education from Chongryon-affiliated schools has declined sharply, with many, if not most, Zainichi now opting to send their children to mainstream Japanese schools. Some Chongryon schools have been closed for lack of funding, and there is serious doubt as to the continuing viability of the system as a whole. Mindan has also traditionally operated a school system for the children of its members, although it has always been less widespread and organized compared to its Chongryon counterpart, and is said to be nearly defunct at the present time.

=== Chongryon ===
Out of the two Korean organizations in Japan, the pro-North Chongryon has been the more militant in terms of retaining Koreans&#x27; ethnic identity. Its policies have included:
* operation of about 60 ethnic Korean schools across Japan, initially partly funded by the North Korean government, in which lessons are conducted in Korean. They maintain a strong pro-North Korean ideology, which has sometimes come under criticism from pupils, parents, and the public alike;
* discouraging its members from taking up Japanese citizenship;
* discouraging its members from marrying Japanese;
* operation of businesses and banks to provide the necessary jobs, services, and social networks for Zainichi Koreans outside mainstream society;
* opposition to Zainichi Koreans&#x27; right to vote or participate in Japanese elections, which is seen as an unacceptable attempt at assimilation into Japanese society;
* and a home-coming movement to North Korea in the late 1950s, which it hailed as a socialist &quot;Paradise on Earth&quot;, with some 90,000 Zainichi Koreans and their Japanese spouses moving to the North before the migration eventually died down.

==== Controversies over Chongryon ====

For a long time, Chongryon enjoyed unofficial immunity from searches and investigations, partly because authorities were reluctant to carry out any actions which could provoke not only accusations of xenophobia but lead to an international incident. Chongryon has long been suspected of a variety of criminal acts on behalf of North Korea, such as illegal transfer of funds to North Korea and espionage, but no action has been taken. However, recently escalating tensions between Japan and North Korea over a number of issues, namely North Korea&#x27;s abduction of Japanese nationals which came to light in 2002 as well as its nuclear weapons program, has led to a resurgence of public animosity against Chongryon. Chongryon schools have alleged numerous cases of verbal abuse and physical violence directed against their students and buildings, and Chongryon facilities have been targets of protests and occasional incidents. The Japanese authorities have recently started to crack down on Chongryon, with investigations and arrests for charges ranging from tax evasion to espionage. These moves are usually criticized by Chongryon as acts of political suppression.

In December 2001, police raided Chongryon&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters and related facilities to investigate Chongryon officials&#x27; suspected role in embezzlement of funds from the failed .

In 2002, Shotaro Tochigi, deputy head of the Public Security Investigation Agency, told a session of the House of Representatives Financial Affairs Committee that the agency was investigating Chongryon for suspected illicit transfers of funds to the North. The image of Chongryon was further tarnished by North Korea&#x27;s surprise 2002 admission that it had indeed abducted Japanese nationals in the 1970s, even after it had categorically and fiercely denied for many years that the abductions had ever taken place and dismissed rumors of North Korean involvement as an allegedly &quot;racist fantasy&quot;. Some of the recent drop in membership of Chongryon is attributed to ordinary members of Chongryon who may have believed in the party line feeling deeply humiliated and disillusioned upon discovering that they had been used as mouthpieces to deny the crimes of the North Korean government.

In March 2006, police raided six Chongryon-related facilities in an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the June 1980 disappearance of one of the alleged abductees, Tadaaki Hara. Police spokesmen said that the head of Chongryon at the time was suspected of co-operating in his kidnapping.

The operation of the &quot;Mangyongbong-92&quot; (currently suspended), a North Korean ferry that is the only regular direct link between North Korea and Japan, is a subject of significant tension, as the ferry is primarily used by Chongryon to send its members to North Korea and to supply North Korea with money and goods donated by the organization and its members. In 2003, a North Korean defector made a statement to the US Senate committee stating that more than 90% of the parts used by North Korea to construct its missiles were brought from Japan aboard the ship.

In May 2006, Chongryon and the pro-South Mindan agreed to reconcile, only for the agreement to break down the following month. North Korea&#x27;s missile tests in July 2006 deepened the divide, with Chongryon refusing to condemn the missile tests, expressing only its regret that the Japanese government has suspended the operation of the &quot;Mangyongbong-92&quot;. Outraged senior Mindan officials joined mainstream Japanese politicians and media in sharply criticizing Chongryon&#x27;s silence over the matter.

==Integration into Japanese society==

During the post-World War II period, Zainichi Koreans faced various kinds of discrimination from Japanese society. Due to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese government created laws to support Japanese citizens by giving financial support, providing shelters, etc. However, after the treaty was signed, Zainichi Koreans were no longer counted as Japanese citizens, so they were unable to get any support from the government. They were unable to get an insurance certificate from the government, so it was difficult for them to get any medical care. Without medical insurance, Zainichi Koreans were unable to go to the hospital since the cost of medication was too high.

Another problem caused by this treaty was that the Japanese government created a law which stated that Korean residents in Japan had to be fingerprinted since Zainichi Koreans had two names (their original name and a name given by the Japanese government). Under this law, Zainichi Koreans had to reveal their identity to the public because when they visited the city hall to provide their fingerprints, their neighbors found out that they were Zainichi Koreans. Therefore, Zainichi Koreans were forced to reveal their identity to Japanese and faced discrimination from them. This made their lives even more difficult. In order to protect themselves, many Zainichi Koreans protested against this law. Mindan and many Zainichi Koreans opposed this law, but the law wasn&#x27;t repealed until 1993. Until then, Zainichi Koreans could not escape from the social discrimination which they had faced in Japanese society.

=== Discrimination ===
Furthermore, it was hard for the Zainichi Koreans to get a job due to discrimination. Zainichi Koreans were often forced into low-wage labor, lived in segregated communities, and faced barriers to their cultural and social practices. Especially, it was very hard for Zainichi Koreans to become public employees since Japan only let Japanese nationals become public employees at that time. Even of those who were able to secure jobs, many ended up working in coal mines, construction sites, and factories under harsh conditions that were markedly worse than those endured by their Japanese counterparts. The disparity was not limited to wages alone; Koreans also faced longer working hours and were subjected to physical abuse by supervisors who enforced strict discipline to maximize productivity. Since many Zainichi Koreans could not get a proper job, they began to get involved in illegal jobs such as &quot;illegal alcohol production, scrap recycling, and racketeering&quot;. As a result, many Zainichi Koreans ended up living in slums or hamlets, a situation aided by Japanese real estate agents&#x27; refusal to let Zainichi Koreans rent houses.

In addition to labor exploitation and housing discrimination, Koreans also endured significant social discrimination. They were segregated into specific neighborhoods, commonly referred to as &quot;Korean Towns,&quot; (which still exist today in Shin-Ōkubo and Ikuno-ku) where living conditions were poor, sanitation was inadequate, and access to public services like healthcare and education was severely limited. Korean children faced bullying and discrimination in schools, which often led to high dropout rates and limited their educational and, subsequently, economic opportunities.

Despite these adversities, the Zainichi community has fought for their rights and has seen gradual improvements in their status in Japan. Changes in legal and social recognition began to emerge towards the late 20th century, influenced by both domestic advocacy by human rights groups and international pressure.

Zainichi today have established a stable presence in Japan after years of activism. Through Mintohren, community support by Zainichi organizations (Mindan and Chongryon, among others), other minority groups (Ainu, &quot;burakumin&quot;, Ryūkyūans, Nivkhs, and others), and sympathetic Japanese, the social atmosphere for Zainichi in Japan has improved. There are also Koreans living in Japan who try to present themselves as Japanese to avoid discrimination. Most younger Zainichi now speak only Japanese, go to Japanese schools, work for Japanese firms, and increasingly marry Japanese people. Most naturalization occurs among the young during the period when they seek formal employment or marriage. Those who have already established their lives increasingly do not choose to retain their South Korean or Joseon nationality or heritage and lead average lives alongside other Japanese. This, as well as marriage to Japanese nationals, is leading to a sharp decrease in the original &quot;Zainichi&quot; population in Japan.

===Assimilation===

One of the most pressing issues of the Zainichi community is the rate of assimilation of Zainichi into Japan. About 4,000 to 5,000 Koreans naturalize in Japan every year out of slightly less than 480,000. Naturalization carries a crucial cultural aspect in Japan, as both Mindan and Chongryon link Korean ethnic identity to Korean nationality, and Japanese and South Korean nationality laws do not allow multiple citizenship for adults. By their definition, opting for a Japanese passport means becoming Japanese, rather than Korean-Japanese.

In order to be naturalized as Japanese citizens, Zainichi Koreans previously had to go through multiple, complex steps, requiring collection of information about their family and ancestors stretching back ten generations. This information could be collected through a Korean organization such as Mindan, but with their prohibitively expensive cost, many were unable to afford it. However, these processes have become much easier, and today, it is easier for Zainichi Koreans to naturalize into Japanese citizens.

Though there are a few cases of celebrities who naturalize with their Korean name, the majority of naturalized Zainichi Koreans formally choose a name that is both read and appears ethnically Japanese. This supports the aforementioned cultural implication of naturalisation, leading some to take the rate of naturalisation as a rough measure of assimilation.

During the post-World War II period, many Zainichi Koreans married with other Zainichi Koreans, and it was a rare case for them to intermarry with Japanese citizens. This was because of Japanese xenophobic prejudice against Zainichi Koreans due to stigma stemming from decades of discrimination. Therefore, Japanese citizens, especially their parents, largely refused marriage with Zainichi Koreans. However, there were problems with marriage between Zainichi Koreans, too. As stated in the previous section, Zainichi Koreans were mostly hiding their identity and living as Japanese-presenting people at the time. Because of this, it was very hard for Zainichi Koreans to connect with other people who had the same nationality as them. They were married mostly through arranged marriages supported by Mindan.

&quot;Tong-il Ilbo&quot; (), or &quot;Tōitsu Nippō&quot; (), a Korean-Japanese newspaper, reported that according to statistics from the Japanese Health and Labour ministry, there were 8,376 marriages between Japanese and Koreans. Compared to 1,971 marriages in 1965, when the statistics began, the number has roughly quadrupled, and it now constitutes about 1% of the 730,971 total marriages in Japan. The highest annual number of marriages between Japanese men and Korean women was 8,940, in 1990. Since 1991, it has fluctuated around 6,000 per year. On the other hand, there were 2,335 marriages between Korean men and Japanese women in 2006. It has been stable since the number reached 2,000 per year in 1984.

In 1975, Hidenori Sakanaka ( &quot;Sakanaka Hidenori&quot;), a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Justice, published a highly controversial document known as the &quot;Sakanaka Paper&quot;. He stated that the assertion by both Mindan and Chongryon that Zainichi are destined to eventually return to Korea is no longer realistic. He further predicted that Zainichi would naturally disappear in the 21st century unless they abandon their link between Korean identity and Korean nationality. He argued that the Japanese government should stop treating Zainichi as temporary residents (with a special status) and start providing a proper legal framework for their permanent settlement as &quot;Korean Japanese&quot;.

In December 1995, &quot;Gendai Korea&quot; (&quot;Modern Korea&quot;) published the article, &quot;20 years after the Sakanaka Paper&quot; to assess further development. The article pointed out that in the 1980s, 50% of Zainichi Koreans married Japanese, and in the 1990s, the rate was 80%. (In fact, they quoted only 1518% Korean marriage during 1990 to 1994.) They also pointed out the change in the law in 1985, which granted Japanese citizenship to a child with either parent being Japaneseprevious laws granted citizenship only to a child with a Japanese father. In practice, this would mean that less than 20% of Zainichi marriages would result in Zainichi status. According to the article, since naturalisation is concentrated among the younger generation, the Zainichi population should be expected to collapse once the older generation starts to die out in two decades.

The latest figures from Mindan showed that the total population of Zainichi was 598,219 in 2006 and 593,489 in 2007, and that only 8.9% married another Zainichi in 2006. There were 1,792 births and 4,588 deaths, resulting in a 2,796 natural decrease. On top of that, there were 8,531 naturalisations, which resulted in a total decrease of 11,327 in 2006 (2%).

===Registration of residents===
After Zainichi Koreans lost Japanese nationality, the Immigration Control Act of 1951 and the Alien Registration Law of 1952 required them to be fingerprinted and to carry a certificate of registration as other foreigners did. The Permanent Residents by Accord of 1965 allowed Zainichi Koreans who had lived in Japan since the colonial period to apply for permanent residency, but their descendants could not. Twenty-six years later, the Japanese Diet passed the Special Law on Immigration Control and categorized Zainichi Koreans who have lived without any gap since the end of World War II or before and their lineal descendants as Special Permanent Residents. The fingerprint requirement for Zainichi Koreans was terminated by 1993.

===Right to vote and government employment===
Long-term ethnic Korean residents of Japan who have not taken up Japanese nationality currently have the legal status of &quot;Tokubetsu Eijusha&quot; (&quot;Special Permanent Residents&quot;) and are granted special rights and privileges compared to other foreigners, especially in matters such as re-entry and deportation statutes. These privileges were originally given to residents with South Korean nationality in 1965, and were extended in 1991 to cover those who have retained their Korean nationality.

Over the decades, Zainichi Koreans have been campaigning to regain their Japanese citizenship rights without having to adopt Japanese nationality. The right to claim social welfare benefits was granted in 1954, followed by access to the national health insurance structures (1960s) and state pensions (1980s). There is some doubt over the legality of some of these policies, as the Public Assistance Law, which governs social welfare payments, is seen to apply only to &quot;Japanese nationals&quot;.

There has been discussion about Zainichi South Koreans&#x27; right to vote in South Korea. Since Special Permanent Residents are exempted from military service and taxes, the South Korean government was reluctant to give them the right to vote, arguing they did not register as residents, though it thought most people agree on granting the right to vote to short-stay South Korean travelers. On the other hand, Zainichi South Koreans claimed that they should be granted it because the Constitution of South Korea guarantees anyone having South Korean nationality the right to vote. In 2007, the Constitutional Court of Korea concluded all South Korean nationals don&#x27;t have the right to vote in South Korea if they are permanent residents of other countries.

Zainichi North Koreans are allowed to vote and theoretically eligible to stand in North Korea&#x27;s show elections if they are 17 years old or older.

There have also been campaigns to allow Zainichi Koreans to take up government employment and participate in elections, which are open to Japanese nationals only. Since 1992, Mindan has been campaigning for the right to vote in elections for prefectural and municipal assemblies, mayors, and prefecture governors, backed by the South Korean government. In 1997, Kawasaki became the first municipality to hire a Korean national. So far, three prefecturesOsaka, Nara, and Kanagawahave supported voting rights for permanent foreign residents.

However, the Japanese Diet has not yet passed a resolution regarding this matter, despite several attempts by a section within the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan to do so, and there is considerable public and political opposition against granting voting rights to those who have not yet adopted Japanese nationality. Instead, the requirements for naturalization have been steadily lowered for Zainichi to the point that only criminal records or affiliation to North Korea would be a hindrance for naturalization. Both Zainichi organisations oppose this, as both see naturalization as &quot;de facto&quot; assimilation. In November 2011, the South Korean government moved to register Zainichi Koreans as voters in South Korean elections, a move which attracted few registrants. While Mindan-affiliated Zainichi Koreans have pressed for voting rights in Japan, they have very little interest in becoming a voting bloc in South Korean politics. Chongryon for its part opposes moves to allow Zainichi Koreans to participate in Japanese politics, on the grounds that they assimilate Koreans into Japanese society and thus weaken Korean ethnic identity.

===Korean schools===

The pro-North Korea association Chongryon operates 218 &quot;Chōsen gakkō&quot; across Japan, including kindergartens and one university, Korea University. All lessons and all conversations within the school are conducted in Korean. They teach a strong pro-North Korean ideology and allegiance to Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un. The textbooks include an idealized depiction of the economic development of North Korea and Songun policy of Kim Jong Il.

One of the issues the schools now face is a lack of funding. The schools were originally set up and run with support from the North Korean government, but this money has now dried up, and with dropping pupil numbers, many schools are facing financial difficulties. The Japanese government has refused Chongryon&#x27;s requests that it fund ethnic schools in line with regular Japanese schools, citing Article 89 of the Japanese Constitution, where use of public funds for education by non-public bodies is prohibited. In reality, the schools are in fact partly funded by local authorities, but subsidies are given in the form of special benefits paid to the families of pupils, as opposed to paying the schools directly, in order to avoid a blatant breach of Article 89. It is still much less than the amount received by state schools.

Another issue is an examination called the High School Equivalency Test, or &quot;daiken&quot;, which qualifies those who have not graduated from a regular high school to apply for a place in a state university and take an entrance exam. Until recently, only those who had completed compulsory education (i.e., up to junior high school) were entitled to take the &quot;daiken&quot;. This meant pupils of ethnic schools had to complete extra coursework before being allowed to take the exam. In 1999, the requirement was amended so that anyone over a certain age is qualified. Campaigners were not satisfied because this still meant graduates of non-Japanese high schools had to take the &quot;daiken&quot;. In 2003, the Education Ministry removed the requirement to take the Equivalency Test from graduates of Chinese schools, Mindan-run Korean schools, and international schools affiliated with Western nations and accredited by U.S. and British organizations. However, this did not apply to graduates of Chongryon-run Korean schools, as the ministry said it could not approve their curricula. The decision was left up to individual universities, 70% of which allowed all Korean school graduates to apply directly.

Due to the issues described above, the number of students at Korean schools run by Chongryon has declined by 67%, and many of the children of Zainichi Koreans now choose to go to orthodox Japanese schools.

There are a few &quot;Kankoku Gakkō&quot; (Korean: , Japanese: ) located in Tokyo, Osaka, Ibaraki, Kyoto, and Ishioka, which receive sponsorship from South Korea and are operated by Mindan. Koreans who live in Japan and support South Korea are likely to attend a &quot;Kankoku gakkō&quot;. Alternatively, they may go to a normal school in Japan taught in Japanese. Most Koreans who have lived in Japan since they were born, however, go to normal schools even if there is a &quot;Kankoku gakkō&quot; near them.

===Legal alias===

Registered aliens in Japan are allowed to adopt a , often abbreviated to , as their legal name. Traditionally, Zainichi Koreans have used Japanese-style names in public, but some Zainichi Koreans, including celebrities and professional athletes, use their original Korean names. Well-known ethnic Koreans who use Japanese names include Hanshin Tigers star Tomoaki Kanemoto, pro wrestlers Riki Choshu and Akira Maeda, and controversial judoka and mixed martial artist Yoshihiro Akiyama.

During the Korea-Japan 2002 FIFA World Cup, a Mindan newspaper conducted a survey regarding the use of aliases. 50% of those polled said that they always use an alias, while 13% stated they always use their original name. 33% stated that they use either depending on the situation. In a 1986 survey, over 90% of ethnic Koreans in Japan reported having a Japanese-sounding name in addition to a Korean one. In a 1998 study, 80% stated that they used their Japanese names when in Japanese company, and 30% stated that they used their Japanese names &quot;almost exclusively&quot;.

==Zainichi in the Japanese labor market==

Zainichi Koreans are said to mainly be employed in &quot;pachinko&quot; parlors, restaurants/bars, and construction. Discrimination against Zainichi Koreans in hiring has pushed many into so-called 3D (dirty, dangerous, and demeaning) industries. Annual sales of &quot;pachinko&quot; have totaled about 30 trillion yen since 1993, and Zainichi Koreans have accounted for 90% of such sales. However, the &quot;pachinko&quot; industry is shrinking, because the Japanese government has imposed stricter regulations. The number of &quot;pachinko&quot; parlors decreased by 9–10% between 2012 and 2016, while the number of people playing &quot;pachinko&quot; dropped to less than 9.4 million.

Some Zainichi Koreans have developed &quot;yakiniku&quot; restaurants. The honorary president of the All Japan &quot;Yakiniku&quot; Association is Tae Do Park (alias Taido Arai).

In the 1970s, Korean newcomers started to enter the precious metals industry. Currently, 70% of precious metals products in Japan are made by certified Zainichi Koreans.

Some Zainichi Koreans participate in organized crime, as do people in other segments of the population. A former member of the &quot;yakuza&quot; group Sumiyoshi-kai estimated there are a few hundred Korean &quot;yakuza&quot;, and that some of them are bosses of branches. However, the member went on to say that Korean gang members tend to go to China and Southeast Asia, as these countries are more lucrative for them than Japan.

There has been improvement in the working rights of Zainichi Koreans since the 1970s. For example, foreigners including Zainichi Koreans were previously not allowed to become lawyers in Japan, but Kim Kyung Deok became the first Zainichi Korean lawyer in 1979. As of 2018, there are more than 100 Zainichi Korean lawyers in Japan, and some of them have worked as members of LAZAK (Lawyers Association of Zainichi Koreans).

== In popular culture ==
The earliest Japanese films featuring Koreans in Japan often depicted Koreans as members of the peripheral society, rather than as main characters. It wasn&#x27;t until after the Second World War that films visualized the struggles and oppression experienced by Zainichi Koreans, with films such as &quot;Three Resurrected Drunkards&quot; (1968) by Nagisa Ōshima, which addressed the bigotry and xenophobia experienced by Zainichi in Japan. The first film to present the Zainichi experience from a Zainichi director was the 1975 film &quot;River of the Stranger&quot; by Lee Hak-in.

Zainichi director Yoichi Sai&#x27;s &quot;All Under the Moon&quot; was the first to receive critical acclaim, earning several best film awards in 1993. In 2001, Zainichi director Lee Sang-il released his first film, &quot;Chong&quot;, and in 2001, Zainichi author Kazuki Kaneshiro&#x27;s Naoki Prize-winning book &quot;GO&quot; (2000), about a North Korean Zainichi, was made into a popular film of the same name. Yang Yong-hi would be the first to address the Chongryon experience in a documentary, with &quot;Dear Pyongyang&quot; in 2005.

Korean American creatives have used the Zainichi experience to parse their own experience as part of the greater Korean diaspora, with films such as Benson Lee&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Seoul Searching&quot;, and author Min Jin Lee&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Pachinko&quot;. &quot;Pachinko&quot; tells the story of several generations of Zainichi Koreans and the prevailing stereotype within Japan about Koreans and &quot;pachinko&quot; parlors; the book explores themes of belonging, nationality, and longstanding political debates about discrimination and xenophobia against Koreans in Japan. The novel has been made into a limited TV series of the same name by Apple TV+.

<text>Josh Gardner (born September 4, 1982) is an American former soccer player. Gardner is currently the technical director for the Houston Rangers academy.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Gardner played college soccer at the University of Cincinnati a starter as a freshman in 2001 to 2003. In 2002, was named second team All-Conference USA, he was tied for team lead with five assists. In 2003, Gardner led the team in points, tied for Bearcats&#x27; team lead with six goals and led the team with six assists. Gardner earned All C-USA first team honors, second team All-Region after leading the Bearcats to the NCAA Tournament for only the second time in school history, and first team All-Ohio. He also played for the Houston Toros in the USL Premier Development League.

===Professional===
On the strength Gardner&#x27;s single exceptional game for the United States U-20 national team in 2003, Gardner was offered a Project-40 contract before the 2004 season, which he signed. He was drafted 13th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Los Angeles Galaxy, but saw very little playing time with the team, appearing in only two games, playing 25 minutes.

His stock rose prior to the 2006 season, as he turned in a strong performance in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup and started two of the first three games of the MLS season. Unfortunately, he soon fell out of favor with then-coach Steve Sampson and would not see much playing time until Sampson was fired and replaced by Frank Yallop. After Yallop&#x27;s arrival, Gardner started every Galaxy game and was even mentioned as a replacement at left-back when the Galaxy traded Todd Dunivant. Gardner scored his first MLS goal on July 8, 2006, against Real Salt Lake. The Galaxy eventually released Gardner on March 23, 2007. During his three years with the Galaxy, Gardner played 1,096 minutes in 21 games and was a member of the Galaxy team that won both the MLS Cup and the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup in 2005.

Gardner signed with the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division in 2007, and quickly became their starting left midfielder, helping them win the USL1 Championship in his first year with the team.

When the USL Sounders were replaced by the MLS expansion team Seattle Sounders FC at the end of the 2008 season Gardner signed with the Carolina RailHawks in January 2009. He played 47 regular season games for Carolina over the next two seasons, helping them to a divisional title and the final of the USSF Division 2 Pro League playoffs in 2010.

Gardner made a return to Major League Soccer in 2011 when he signed with the Columbus Crew. He made his Black &amp; Gold debut on February 22, 2011, in leg 1 of the Crew&#x27;s CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final series against Real Salt Lake. On August 27, 2011, Gardner set an MLS record for fastest time between a goal and an own goal against the Seattle Sounders, scoring in the 73rd minute, and scoring an own goal in the 74th.

Gardner was left exposed by Columbus in the 2011 MLS Expansion Draft and was selected by expansion side Montreal Impact. He stayed with Montreal through the 2012 season, but the club announced in November 2012 that he would not return in 2013. His rights were traded to Sporting Kansas City in exchange for a second-round 2013 MLS SuperDraft pick.

Gardner was waived by Sporting on March 25, 2014.

===International===
In 2003 Gardner was invited to play in the US Soccer Festival with the United States U-20 national team. He assisted on the game&#x27;s only goal.

==Honors==

===Sporting Kansas City===
*MLS Cup: 2013

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
*MLS Cup: 2005

===Seattle Sounders===
*USL First Division Championship (1): 2007
*USL First Division Commissioner&#x27;s Cup (1): 2007

<text>A. A. Krishnaswami Ayyangar (1892–1953) was an Indian mathematician. He received his M.A. in Mathematics at the age of 18 from Pachaiyappa&#x27;s College, and subsequently taught mathematics there. In 1918, he joined the mathematics department of the University of Mysore and retired from there in 1947. He was born in a Tamil Brahmin family. He died in June 1953. He was the father of the Kannada poet and scholar A. K. Ramanujan.

==Works==
Ayyangar had a number of publications, including an article on the Chakravala method where he showed how the method differed from the method of continued fractions. He pointed out that this point was missed by André Weil, who thought that the Chakravala method was only an &quot;experimental fact&quot; to the Indians and attributed general proofs to Pierre de Fermat and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Professor Subhash Kak of Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge first noted that Ayyangar&#x27;s presentations of the work of other Indian mathematicians was unique, and was instrumental in bringing it to the notice of the scientific community.

<text>The 90 mm gun M1/M2/M3 was an American heavy anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, playing a role similar to the German 8.8cm Flak 18. It had a diameter bore, and a 50 caliber barrel, giving it a length of . It was capable of firing a shell horizontally, or a maximum altitude of .

The 90 mm gun was the US Army&#x27;s primary heavy anti-aircraft gun from just prior to the opening of World War II into 1946, complemented by small numbers of the much larger 120 mm M1 gun. Both were widely deployed in the United States postwar as the Cold War presented a perceived threat from Soviet bombers. The anti-aircraft guns were phased out in the middle 1950s as their role was taken over by surface-to-air missiles such as the MIM-3 Nike Ajax.

As a tank gun it was the main weapon of the M36 tank destroyer and M26 Pershing tank, as well as a number of post-war tanks like the M56 Scorpion. It was also briefly deployed from 1943–1946 as a coast defense weapon with the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. Each gun cost roughly $50,000 to make in 1940 and utilized up to 30 separate contractors to manufacture.

==History==
Prior to World War II, the primary US anti-aircraft guns were the 3-inch M1918 gun (76.2 mm L/40) and 3-inch anti-aircraft gun M3 (76.2 mm L/50), a widely used caliber for this class of weapon. Similar weapons were in British, Soviet and other arsenals. There had been several upgrades to the weapon over its history, including the experimental T8 and T9 versions developed in the early 1930s, that were intended to enter service later in that decade.

However, the US Army became interested in a much more capable weapon instead, and on 9 June 1938, it issued a development contract calling for two new guns, one of 90 mm, which it felt was the largest possible size that was still capable of being manually loaded at high elevations, and another, using assisted loading, of . On 18 August 1938 the development of the Mounting T1 was approved as well. The new design seemed so much better than developments of the older three-inch that work on the three-inch T9 was canceled in 1938, just as it became production-ready. On 21 March 1940, the second development of the 90 mm design, the T2, was standardized as the &quot;90 mm M1&quot;, while its larger cousin became the 120 mm M1 gun.

A few hundred M1s were completed when several improvements were added to produce the &quot;90 mm M1A1&quot;, which entered production in late 1940, and was accepted as the standard on 22 May 1941. Since national arsenals had limited capacity, production of first 300 gun mounts was contracted to Allis-Chalmers in November 1940, with the first unit shipped in September 1941. The M1A1 included an improved mount and spring-rammer on the breech, with the result that firing rates went up to 20 rounds per minute. Several thousand were available when the US entered the war, and the M1A1 was their standard anti-aircraft gun for the rest of the conflict. Production rates continued to improve, topping out in a few thousand per month.

Like the German 88 and the British QF 3.7 inch AA gun, the M1A1 was used against tanks in combat but, unlike the others, it could not be depressed to fire against them. On 11 September 1942, the Army issued specifications for a new mount to allow it to be used in this role, which resulted in the &quot;90 mm M2&quot;, introducing yet another new mount, one that could be depressed to 10 degrees below the horizontal and featured a new electrically-assisted rammer. It became the standard weapon from 13 May 1943.

==Anti-aircraft operation==

In anti-aircraft use, the guns were normally operated in groups of four, controlled by the M7 or M9 gun director or Kerrison predictors. Radar direction was common, starting with the SCR-268 in 1941, which was not accurate enough to directly lay the guns, but provided accurate ranging throughout the engagement. For night-time use, a searchlight was slaved to the radar with a beam width set so that the target would be somewhere in the beam when it was turned on, at which point the engagement continued as in the day. In 1944, the system was upgraded with the addition of the SCR-584 microwave radar, which was accurate to about 0.06 degrees (1 mil) and also provided automatic tracking. With the SCR-584, direction and range information was sent directly to the Bell Labs M3 gun data computer, and M9 director, which could direct and lay the guns automatically, all the crews had to do was load the guns.

==Main anti-tank developments==
The M3 was also adapted as the main gun for various armored vehicles, starting with the experimental T7 which was accepted as the &quot;90 mm M3&quot;. The test firing of the M3 took place on an M10 tank destroyer in early 1943. The M3 gun was used on the M36 tank destroyer, and the T26 (later, M26) Pershing tank. The M3 fired an M82 APC shot with a muzzle velocity of . However, both the muzzle velocity of the standard M3 gun and the quality of the steel used in the M82 APC (armor-piercing capped) shot, while comparable to the 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 mounted on the Tiger I, were inferior to the Tiger II&#x27;s KwK 43 L/71 8.8 cm main gun firing its standard APCBC (armor-piercing capped ballistic cap) shot used by German forces, with the result that the former&#x27;s penetration fell far short of the standard projectile fired by that German tank. As a result, US ordnance provided some T26/M26 tank crews with the 90 mm HVAP (high-velocity, armor-piercing) tungsten penetrator sub-caliber projectile with a muzzle velocity of , or the T33 AP with a re-heat-treated projectile with ballistic windshield and a muzzle velocity of . The HVAP could compete with the KwK 43&#x27;s penetration performance when firing standard APCBC, but tungsten ammunition was always in short supply.

===Performance===
An unsuccessful anti-tank variant was the T8 gun on the T5 carriage. The gun was an M1 with the recoil mechanism from the M2A1 105 mm howitzer. Eventually a version of the T8 with the T20E1 gun and T15 carriage was tested; this led to the 105 mm anti-tank gun T8.

Because the standard fifteen-and-a-half foot long M3 90 mm main tank gun proved incapable of penetrating the heaviest frontal armor of the heaviest German tanks such as the Tiger II tank and the rarer Jagdtiger tank destroyer variant, a number of improved versions of the M3 were developed, including the T14 which included a standard muzzle brake and the T15 series. The 90 mm T15E1 L/73, with its long barrel, was designed and developed as an AT gun that could match or surpass the performance of the 8.8 cm KwK43 L/71 cannon, the famous long 88 on the Tiger II.

== High-velocity 90 mm gun T15 performance ==
The T15 90 mm L/73 anti-tank gun utilized many types of armor piercing ammunition.

* &quot;T43 APBC:&quot; A solid shot, it was a modified T33 for use by the T15. It had a muzzle velocity of and therefore increased penetration capabilities. It could punch through of armor angled at 60°(from vertical) up to about .
* &quot;T41 APCBC:&quot; Modified M82 projectile of the M3 cannon, fired at a much higher velocity of 3,200 ft/s, than the normal 2,670 ft/s. It could defeat up to of vertical armor at .
* &quot;T44 HVAP:&quot; Modified M304(T30E16) for use out of the T15. Muzzle velocity of . Maximum penetration of of vertical armor at 30 ft.
* &quot;T50 APCBC&quot;: An M82 projectile with increased nose hardness and overall better design. Same muzzle velocity 3,200 ft/s, but increased penetration, equal to the KwK43. against vertical armor at point-blank range.

Two versions of the T15 were made: the T15E1 with single-piece ammunition and the T15E2 with two-piece ammunition.

By mid-March 1945, a T26E1 pilot was equipped with the 90 mm T15E1 and was sent to Europe in a &quot;trial by combat&quot;. It was given to the 3rd Armor Division where it was enhanced with additional armor plates. Its gun was fired in anger on only one occasion, on 4 April 1945, where it engaged and destroyed a German armored vehicle, probably a Tiger I or Panther, at a range of during the fighting along the Weser River.
According to the memoirs of John P. Irwin, it knocked out a King Tiger in Dessau as well as a Panzer IV and a Panther. However, the Tiger II claim is disputed by historians on the grounds that the nearest unit known to be equipped with Tiger IIs was 70 miles from Dessau on the date when the kill was claimed.

Near the end of World War II, more experimental versions of the 90 mm gun were tested including the higher-velocity T18 and T19 main guns. The T19 was a T18 modified in an attempt to reduce barrel wear. Other versions included the T21, which was intended for wheeled vehicles, and the T22, which used the breech from the standard 105 mm M2 howitzer. The T21 and T22 were designed to use larger powder charges. None of these versions entered service.

In the post-World War II era, development of the T15 continued redesignated as the T54, which used a slightly shorter and fatter propellent casing than that of the T15E1. The T54 served as the main gun on the M26E1 Pershing.

== Further developments ==
In 1948 an improved version of the M3A1, designated as the T119, was designed to be used on the T42 (and later M47 Patton) and had a higher muzzle velocity using new ammunition loaded to produce higher chamber pressures. The new ammunition had a slightly longer shoulder to prevent accidental chambering in the older M3 variants. The T119 was backwards compatible with the ammunition used on the M3A1. Upon standardization of the M47 in 1951, the T119E1 version was redesignated as the 90 mm gun M36.

The lightweight variant of the T119, designated as the T139 and standardized as the 90 mm gun M41, equipped the M48 Patton tanks used in the Vietnam War. The M41 with a modified recoil system was mounted as the 90 mm gun M54 on the M56 Scorpion anti-tank vehicle. This gun was found to be inadequate and incapable of penetrating modern armor, requiring a stop gap of HEAT-FS shells to be utilized until the 105mm L7 derivative could become more prevalent. 

==Coast artillery==
During World War II the Coast Artillery Corps adopted the 90 mm M1 to supplement or replace aging three-inch guns in harbor defense commands in CONUS and US territories. The guns were organized in anti-motor torpedo boat (AMTB) batteries, typically with four 90 mm guns and two 37 mm or 40 mm AA guns each. Typically two of the 90 mm guns were on T3/M3 fixed mounts and two were on towed M1A1 or M2 mounts, with the 37 mm or 40 mm weapons on single towed mounts. The T3/M3 mount was designed for anti-surface or anti-aircraft fire. Emplacements for at least 90 batteries of two fixed guns each, plus mobile weapons, were constructed in CONUS, Panama, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere in 1943.

==Variants==
===M1===
*Towed anti-aircraft gun. Approved for service in 1940.
*Fixed on T3/M3 mount for coastal artillery service

===M1A1===
Towed anti-aircraft gun. Production began in 1940. It featured the M8A1 spring rammer. Its rate of fire was 20 rounds per minute.
===M2===
A complete redesign to make the gun dual role, functioning as an anti-tank gun as well as an anti-aircraft gun. The ammunition feed was upgraded and an automatic fuze setter-rammer, the M20, was added. This enabled the rate of fire to reach up to 24 rounds per minute. Elevation was improved with the gun able to depress to −10 degrees. To protect the crew, a large metal shield was added. The M2 was the standard weapon by 13 May 1943. From the march it could fire from its wheels in three minutes, and from a fully emplaced position in seven minutes. In 1944 the weapon was enhanced with the addition of proximity fused shells.

===M3===
A tank-mounted anti-tank version of the gun. It was used to equip the M36 tank destroyer and the M26 Pershing tank. It is also known as the &quot;90 mm L/53&quot;.
====M3A1====

<doc id="1162904" wikidata="Q555264" url="?curid=1162904" title="Shaun Livingston">
<text>Shaun Patrick Livingston (born September 11, 1985) is an American professional basketball executive and former player. He entered the league directly out of high school and was selected fourth by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2004 NBA draft. During his 15-year career, Livingston played 959 games for nine teams and won three NBA championships as a member of the Golden State Warriors—in 2015, 2017 and 2018.

In February 2007, Livingston suffered a debilitating knee injury that damaged almost every part of his left knee. It took Livingston about a year and a half to return. Between 2008 and 2010, he played only 22 league games. Livingston also played for the Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, and Tulsa 66ers. He played his last five seasons in the league with the Warriors and retired from professional basketball in September 2019.

==Early years==
Livingston was born in Peoria, Illinois. He led Concordia Lutheran Grade School to LSA state titles in 1999 and 2000. Livingston played competitive basketball in high school at Richwoods High School for two years and then transferred to Peoria Central High School, where he led his team to back-to-back Class AA state titles in 2003 and 2004.

In 2004, Livingston was named Illinois Mr. Basketball and played in the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game. In 2007, he was voted one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament for his superior performance in the tournament. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Livingston was listed as the No. 1 point guard and the No. 2 player in the nation in 2004. He committed to play college hoops at Duke, but opted instead to make the jump to the NBA straight out of high school.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Clippers (2004–2008)===
Livingston committed to Duke, but opted to skip college and enter the 2004 NBA draft, where he was selected fourth by the Los Angeles Clippers. Livingston was and was considered to be tall by point guard standards and due to the addition of Sam Cassell to the Clippers&#x27; roster, gained playing time as a shooting guard instead. Livingston recorded a career-high 14 assists on February 23, 2007, against the Golden State Warriors.

In his first two NBA seasons, Livingston played 91 games and averaged 6.3 points per game. In his third season, Livingston averaged a career-high 9.3 points per game, being one of the few Clippers to improve from the 2005–06 season. In a game against the Charlotte Bobcats on February 26, 2007, Livingston suffered a debilitating knee injury, dislocating his left kneecap after landing awkwardly following a missed layup, resulting in the left leg snapping laterally. Livingston injured almost every part of his knee, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the lateral meniscus, badly spraining his medial collateral ligament (MCL), and dislocating his patella and his tibio-fibular joint. Livingston was told by a medical professional at the hospital that there was a chance that his leg would have to be amputated. Livingston required months of rehabilitation to be able to walk again. He was also riddled by injuries during the first three years of his professional career, and missed 101 of 246 regular season games.

===Miami Heat (2008–2009)===
Livingston&#x27;s contract with the Clippers expired after the 2007–08 season, and the Clippers did not make him a $5.8 million qualifying offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. On June 16, 2008, doctors allowed Livingston to resume basketball activities; during the 2008 offseason, he tried to find a guaranteed contract to finalize his comeback. The Minnesota Timberwolves and Portland Trail Blazers were interested, but it was reported Livingston eventually signed a two-year deal with the Miami Heat on October 3, 2008. In four games with the Heat, he averaged 2.3 points and 10.3 minutes.

=== Tulsa 66ers (2009) ===
On January 7, 2009, Livingston was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies along with cash considerations for a conditional 2012 second-round pick. He was then waived later that same day. On March 7, 2009, Livingston signed with the Tulsa 66ers, the NBA development league team owned by the Oklahoma City Thunder.

=== Oklahoma City Thunder (2009) ===
After three weeks with the 66ers, Livingston signed a multi-year deal with the Thunder on March 31, 2009. On December 22, 2009, Livingston was waived by the Thunder.

=== Washington Wizards (2010) ===

On February 26, 2010, Livingston signed the first of his two 10-day contracts with the Washington Wizards. He was then signed by the Wizards for the remainder of the season.

=== Charlotte Bobcats (2010–2011) ===
On July 20, 2010, Livingston signed a two-year contract worth $7 million with the Charlotte Bobcats.

=== Milwaukee Bucks (2011–2012) ===
On June 23, 2011, Livingston was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-way deal that included the Sacramento Kings and Charlotte Bobcats.

=== Return to Washington (2012) ===
On June 26, 2012, Livingston was traded to the Houston Rockets for Samuel Dalembert along with teammates Jon Leuer and Jon Brockman. Before the beginning of the season, however, they were all waived. On November 15, 2012, Livingston signed with the Washington Wizards. He was waived by the Wizards on December 23, 2012.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (2012–2013) ===
On December 25, 2012, the Cleveland Cavaliers claimed Livingston off waivers after releasing Donald Sloan. Livingston made his debut for the Cavaliers on January 2, 2013, recording two points, two rebounds, and one assist in 13 minutes of action off the bench.

===Brooklyn Nets (2013–2014)===
On July 11, 2013, Livingston signed with the Brooklyn Nets. His season-high of 23 points came in a 98–108 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on November 18, 2013. Initially billed as a backup, Livingston performed well enough to join Deron Williams in the starting lineup following a season-ending injury to Brook Lopez. With Livingston on the floor, the Nets proved to be 8.5 points per 100 possessions better defensively, and he earned the third-most minutes on the team. On March 17, Livingston set a career-high for both minutes played and points scored in a season. At the end of the season Livingston had played in a career-high 76 games (beating a previous high of 61 games) and averaged 8.3 points, 3.2 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.

===Golden State Warriors (2014–2019)===
On July 11, 2014, Livingston signed with the Golden State Warriors for a reported three-year, $16 million contract. On August 15, 2014, he was ruled out for six to eight weeks after having arthroscopic surgery on the big toe of his right foot. Livingston recovered in time to make his debut for the team in their season opener, and served as a key player off the bench for the Warriors in their run to the 2015 NBA Championship and soon became an integral member of the Warriors dynasty.

In 2015–16, Livingston helped the Warriors win an NBA record 73 games to eclipse the 72 wins set by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. During Game 4 of the 2016 Western Conference semi-finals, Livingston was ejected late in the second quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers. He had moved into the starting lineup to accommodate for the injured Stephen Curry. In the Western Conference Finals, the Warriors overcame a 3–1 deficit to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in seven games and advance to the 2016 NBA Finals. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Livingston scored a playoff career-high 20 points, leading the Warriors to a 104–89 victory. Despite the Warriors going up 3–1 in the series following a Game 4 victory, they went on to lose the series in seven games.

In 2016–17, Livingston helped the Warriors win the NBA Championship after defeating the Cavaliers 4–1 in the 2017 NBA Finals. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.

On July 25, 2017, Livingston re-signed with the Warriors on a three-year, $24 million contract. On December 4, he was suspended for one game without pay for an altercation with game official Courtney Kirkland during a game against the Miami Heat a day earlier. Livingston helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2018 after defeating the Cavaliers in a four-game sweep in the Finals.

In 2019, Livingston played in his fifth straight NBA Finals, where the Warriors lost to the Toronto Raptors in six games. His final NBA game was Game 6 of this final series (played on June 13, 2019, with the Warriors losing to the Raptors 110 - 114) where he recorded six points and a steal in 16 minutes of playing time.

On July 10, 2019, Livingston was waived by the Warriors. He went unsigned during free agency.

===Retirement===
On September 13, 2019, Livingston announced his retirement from the NBA. In a post, he stated: &quot;After 15 years in the NBA, I’m excited, sad, fortunate and grateful all in one breath. Hard to put into a caption all of the emotions it takes to try and accomplish your dreams.&quot;

==Post-playing career==
On September 15, 2020, the Golden State Warriors announced that they had named Livingston as director of players affairs and engagement. He won his fourth NBA championship after the Warriors defeated the Boston Celtics in six games in the 2022 NBA Finals. Livingston left the role on June 20, 2023, citing a desire to spend more time with his family outside of the Bay Area.

==Personal life==
Livingston is a Lutheran. In April 2016, he donated $1 million to his former grade school, Concordia Lutheran School, in Peoria, Illinois.

<doc id="1162908" wikidata="Q4053114" url="?curid=1162908" title="Whitesmiths">
<text>Whitesmiths Ltd. was a software company founded in New York City by P. J. Plauger, Mark Krieger and Gabriel Pham, and last located in Westford, Massachusetts. It sold a Unix-like operating system called Idris, as well as the first commercial C compiler, Whitesmiths C.

The Whitesmiths compiler, first written for the PDP-11, was released in 1978 and compiled a version of C similar to that accepted by Version 6 Unix (Dennis Ritchie&#x27;s original C compiler). It was an entirely new implementation, borrowing no code from Unix. Today, it is mainly remembered for lending its name to a particular indentation style, originally used in the code examples which accompanied it. Whitesmith&#x27;s first customer for their C compiler was Fischer &amp; Porter, a process control company then located in Warminster, Pennsylvania. Besides PDP-11, the compiler had code generators for Intel 8080/Zilog Z80, Motorola MC68000, and VAX-11, and it was commonly used as a cross compiler. Whitesmiths also developed a Pascal front-end for the compiler, that emitted C-language code for input to the C compiler.

By 1983 Whitesmiths was one of several vendors of Unix-like operating systems. That year Whitesmiths formed a technical and business alliance with France-based COSMIC Software. At that time, Whitesmiths published 16-bit compilers for machines like PDP-11 while COSMIC published 8-bit compilers for Intel and Motorola CPUs. This technology alliance improved compilers for both markets. Whitesmiths was actively involved in developing the original ANSI C standard supplying several members to the standards committee and hosting some technical sessions. They were one of the first suppliers of an ANSI C compliant compiler.

The company&#x27;s president from 1978 to 1988 was P. J. Plauger. Whitesmiths merged with Intermetrics in December 1988, leading to further mergers and acquisitions.

<doc id="1162925" wikidata="Q1960177" url="?curid=1162925" title="Emerald ash borer">
<text>The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), also known by the acronym EAB, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to north-eastern Asia that feeds on ash species (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; spp.). Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to Europe and North America. Before it was found in North America, very little was known about the emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, and through the use of insecticides and biological control.

==History==

French priest and naturalist Armand David collected a specimen of the species during one of his trips through Imperial China in the 1860s and 1870s. He found the beetle in Beijing and sent it to France, where the first brief description of &quot;Agrilus planipennis&quot; by the entomologist Léon Fairmaire was published in the &quot;Revue d&#x27;Entomologie&quot; in 1888. Unaware of Fairmaire&#x27;s description, a separate description naming the species as &quot;Agrilus marcopoli&quot; was published in 1930 by Jan Obenberger.

==Identification==
Adult beetles are typically bright metallic green and about long and wide. Elytra are typically a darker green, but can also have copper hues. Emerald ash borer is the only North American species of &quot;Agrilus&quot; with a bright red upper abdomen when viewed with the wings and elytra spread. The species also has a small spine found at the tip of the abdomen and serrate antennae that begin at the fourth antennal segment. They leave tracks in the trees they damage below the bark that are sometimes visible. Adult beetles of other species can often be misidentified by the public.

==Life cycle==
The emerald ash borer life cycle can occur over one or two years depending on the time of year of oviposition, the health of the tree, and temperature.

After 400–500 accumulated degree-days above , adults begin to emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1,000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate. Mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.

Eggs are deposited between bark crevices, flakes, or cracks and hatch about two weeks later. Eggs are approximately in diameter, and are initially white, but later turn reddish-brown if fertile. After hatching, larvae chew through the bark to the inner phloem, cambium, and outer xylem where they feed and develop. Emerald ash borer has four larval instars. By feeding, larvae create long serpentine galleries. Fully mature fourth-instar larvae are long. In fall, mature fourth-instars excavate chambers about into the sapwood or outer bark where they fold into a J-shape. These J-shaped larvae shorten into prepupae and develop into pupae and adults the following spring. To exit the tree, adults chew holes from their chamber through the bark, which leaves a characteristic D-shaped exit hole. Immature larvae can overwinter in their larval gallery, but can require an additional summer of feeding before overwintering again and emerging as adults the following spring. This two-year life cycle is more common in cool climates, such as European Russia.

==Range==

The native range of the emerald ash borer is temperate north-eastern Asia, which includes Russia, Mongolia, northern China, Japan, and Korea.

The beetle is invasive in North America where it has a core population in Michigan and surrounding states and provinces. Populations are more scattered outside the core area, and the edges of its known distribution range north to Ontario, south to northern Louisiana, west to Nebraska, and east to New Brunswick. Satellite populations also exist in Colorado and in the Pacific Northwest in Oregon. In eastern Europe, a population was found in Moscow in 2003. From 2003 to 2016, this population has spread west towards the European Union at up to per year and is expected to reach central Europe between 2031 and 2036. Although not recorded from the European Union as of 2019, it has already spread to far eastern Ukraine from neighboring Russia.

== Host plants==
In its native range, emerald ash borer is only a nuisance pest on native trees, as population densities typically do not reach levels lethal to healthy trees. In China, it infests native &quot;Fraxinus chinensis&quot;, &quot;F. mandshurica&quot;, and &quot;F. rhynchophylla&quot;; in Japan it also infests &quot;F. japonica&quot; and &quot;F. lanuginosa&quot;.

Emerald ash borer primarily infest and can cause significant damage to ash species including green ash (&quot;F. pennsylvanica&quot;), black ash (&quot;F. nigra&quot;), white ash (&quot;F. americana&quot;), and blue ash (&quot;F. quadrangulata&quot;) in North America. In Europe, &quot;F. excelsior&quot; is the main ash species colonized, which is moderately resistant to emerald ash borer infestation. Ash susceptibility can vary depending on the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but it is unclear whether the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline because of drought. Another non-ash host has also been discovered, &quot;Olea europaea&quot;, albeit in a lab setting.

Adults prefer to lay eggs on open grown or stressed ash but readily lay eggs on healthy trees amongst other tree species. Ashes that grow in pure stands, whether naturally occurring or in landscaping, are more prone to attack than isolated trees or ones located in mixed forest stands. Ashes used in landscaping also tend to be subjected to higher amounts of environmental stresses including compacted soil, lack of moisture, heating effects from urban islands, road salt, and pollution, which may also reduce their resistance to the borer. Furthermore, most ashes used in landscaping were produced from a handful of cultivars, resulting in low genetic diversity. Young trees with bark between to are preferred. Both males and females use leaf volatiles and sesquiterpenes in the bark to locate hosts. Damage occurs in infested trees by larval feeding. The serpentine feeding galleries of the larvae disrupt the flow of nutrients and water, effectively girdling, thus killing the tree, as it is no longer able to transport sufficient water and nutrients to the leaves to survive. Girdled ashes will often attempt to regenerate through stump sprouting, and there is evidence that stressed trees may also generate higher than normal seed crops as an emergency measure.

==Invasiveness==

Outside its native range, emerald ash borer is an invasive species that is highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. Before emerald ash borer was found in North America, very little was known about the insect in its native range aside from a short description of life-history traits and taxonomic descriptions, which resulted in focused research on its biology in North America. The insect was first identified in Canton, Michigan (near Detroit), in 2002, but it may have been in the U.S. since the late 1980s. It is suspected that it was introduced from overseas in shipping materials such as packing crates.

Without factors that would normally suppress emerald ash borer populations in its native range (e.g., resistant trees, predators, and parasitoid wasps), populations can quickly rise to damaging levels. After initial infestation, all ash trees are expected to die in an area within 10 years without control measures. Every North American ash species has susceptibility to emerald ash borer, as North American species planted in China also have high mortality from infestations, but some Asian ash species are resistant, including &quot;F. baroniana, F. chinensis, F. floribunda, F. mandshurica&quot;, and &quot;F. platypoda&quot;.

Green ash and black ash trees are preferred by emerald ash borer. White ash is also killed rapidly but usually only after all green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash is known to exhibit a higher degree of resistance to emerald ash borer, which is believed to be caused by the high tannin content in the leaves making the foliage unpalatable to the insect. While most Asian ashes have evolved this defense, it is absent from American species other than blue ash. Researchers have examined populations of so-called &quot;lingering ash&quot;, trees that survived ash borer attack with little or no damage, as a means of grafting or breeding new, resistant stock. Many of these lingering ashes were found to have unusual phenotypes that may result in increased resistance. Aside from their higher tannin content, Asian ashes also employ natural defenses to repel, trap, and kill emerald ash borer larvae. Although studies of American ashes have suggested that they are capable of mustering similar defensive mechanisms, the trees do not appear to recognize when they are under attack. Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America. Predators and parasitoids native to North America do not sufficiently suppress emerald ash borer, so populations continue to grow. Birds such as woodpeckers feed on emerald ash borer larva, although the adult beetles have not been used by any American fauna as food. Emerald ash borer populations can spread between per year. It primarily spreads through flight or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.

Other factors can limit spread. Winter temperatures of approximately limit range expansion, and overwintering emerald ash borer survive down to average temperatures of because of antifreeze chemicals in the body and insulation provided by tree bark. Larvae can also survive high heat up to . Conversely, much like ashes grown in the nursery trade, the population of emerald ash borer in North America is believed to have originated from a single group of insects from central China and also exhibits low genetic diversity.

North American predators and parasitoids can occasionally cause high emerald ash borer mortality, but generally offer only limited control. Mortality from native woodpeckers is variable. Parasitism by parasitoids such as &quot;Atanycolus cappaerti&quot; can be high, but overall such control is generally low.

The United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service published a rule on December 14, 2020—to take effect one month later, January 14, 2021—ending all EAB quarantine activities in the United States due to ineffectiveness so far. Other means will be used instead, especially biological controls (see §Biological control below).

These insects have managed to eliminate close to 300,000 Ash trees in the National Capital Region in only nine years. This leaves only 80,000 ash trees left standing either due to luck or to some amount of resistance to the beetles. These forests used to have an extremely dense Ash population, having 17-18 trees per Hectare. Now, there are only 5-6 trees per Hectare. This illustrates extremely well the overall destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the relevance to the everyday person. Something extremely important to note about this severe loss of Ash trees is the effect that it has on the ecosystem of that area. Swamplands that used to be home many Ash forest have now become shrublands, completely changing the ecosystem of that area permanently. The impact this has on the wildlife is extreme because of all the animals that used every part of the tree as refuge, such as birds in the foliage, small rodents amongst the roots, etc.

===Environmental and economic impacts===

Emerald ash borer threatens the entire North American genus &quot;Fraxinus&quot;. It has killed tens of millions of ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the 8.7 billion ash trees throughout North America. Emerald ash borer kills young trees several years before reaching their seeding age of 10 years. In both North America and Europe, the loss of ash from an ecosystem can result in increased numbers of invasive plants, changes in soil nutrients, and effects on species that feed on ash.

Damage and efforts to control the spread of emerald ash borer have affected businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas because of treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down the rate at which trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states over 10 years, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion (with another estimate putting the removal alone at $20–60 billion). Some urban areas such as Minneapolis have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.

===Monitoring===
In areas where emerald ash borer has not yet been detected, surveys are used to monitor for new infestations. Visual surveys are used to find ash trees displaying emerald ash borer damage, and traps with colors attractive to emerald ash borer, such as purple or green, are hung in trees as part of a monitoring program. These traps can also have volatile pheromones applied to them that attract primarily males.

Sometimes trees are girdled to act as trap trees to monitor for emerald ash borer. The stressed tree attracts egg-laying females in the spring, and trees can be debarked in the fall to search for larvae. If detected, an area is often placed under a quarantine to prevent infested wood material from causing new infestations. Further control measures are then taken within the area to slow population growth by reducing beetle numbers, preventing them from reaching reproductive maturity and dispersing, and reducing the abundance of ash trees.

Government agencies in both the U.S. and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, &quot;Cerceris fumipennis&quot;, as a means of detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash borer populations.

===Management===
In areas where emerald ash borer is non-native and invasive, quarantines, infested tree removal, insecticides, and biological control are used to reduce damage to ash trees.

====Quarantine and tree removal====
Once an infestation is detected, quarantines are typically imposed by state, or previously, national government agencies disallowing transport of ash firewood or live plants outside of these areas without permits indicating the material has been inspected or treated (i.e., heat treatment or wood chipping) to ensure no live emerald ash borer are present in the bark and phloem. In urban areas, trees are often removed once an infestation is found to reduce emerald ash borer population densities and the likelihood of further spread. Urban ash are typically replaced with non-ash species such as maple, oak, or linden to limit food sources. In rural areas, trees can be harvested for lumber or firewood to reduce ash stand density, but quarantines may apply for this material, especially in areas where the material could be infested.

Kentucky Extension specialists suggest selecting uncommon species to replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, a factor in the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and bald cypress.

====Insecticides====

Insecticides with active ingredients such as azadirachtin, imidacloprid, emamectin benzoate, and dinotefuran are currently used. Dinotefuran and imidacloprid are systemic (i.e., incorporated into the tree) and remain effective for one to three years depending on the product. Insecticides are typically only considered a viable option in urban areas with high value trees near an infestation. Ash trees are primarily treated by direct injection into the tree or soil drench. Some insecticides cannot be applied by homeowners and must be applied by licensed applicators. Damage from emerald ash borer can continue to increase over time even with insecticide applications. Insecticide treatments are not feasible for large forested areas outside of urban areas.

====Biological control====
The native range of emerald ash borer in Asia was surveyed for parasitoid species that parasitize emerald ash borer and do not attack other insect species in the hope they would suppress populations when released in North America. Three species imported from China were approved for release by the USDA in 2007 and in Canada in 2013: &quot;Spathius agrili&quot;, &quot;Tetrastichus planipennisi&quot;, and &quot;Oobius agrili&quot;, while &quot;Spathius galinae&quot; was approved for release in 2015. Excluding &quot;Spathius galinae&quot;, which has only recently been released, the other three species have been documented parasitizing emerald ash borer larvae one year after release, indicating that they survived the winter, but establishment varied among species and locations. &quot;Tetrastichus planipennisi&quot; and &quot;Oobius agrili&quot; established and have had increasing populations in Michigan since 2008; &quot;Spathius agrili&quot; has had lower establishment success in North America, which could be caused by a lack of available emerald ash borer larvae at the time of adult emergence in spring, limited cold tolerance, and better suitability to regions of North America below the 40th parallel.

The USDA is also assessing the application of &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, an insect fungal pathogen, for controlling emerald ash borer in conjunction with parasitoid wasps.

<doc id="1162938" wikidata="Q1369122" url="?curid=1162938" title="Zabur">
<text>The Zabur () is, according to Islam, the holy book of Dawud (David in Islam), one of the holy books revealed by Allah before the Quran, alongside others such as the &quot;Tawrāh (Torah)&quot; and the Injīl (Gospel). Muslim tradition maintains that the Zabur mentioned in the Quran is the Psalms of Dawud (David in Islam).

The Christian monks and ascetics of pre-Islamic Arabia may be associated in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry with texts called &quot;mazmour&quot;, which in other contexts may refer to palm leaf documents. This has been interpreted by some as referring to psalters.

Among many Christians in the Middle East and in South Asia, the word &quot;mazmour&quot; (Hindustani , ) is used for the Psalms of David in the Hebrew Bible.

==Etymology==
The Arabic word means &quot;book&quot;, &quot;inscription&quot;, or &quot;writing.&quot; In early sources it may refer to Ancient South Arabian writing on palm leaves.

Much of Western scholarship sees the word in the sense &quot;psalter&quot; as being a conflation of Arabic , &quot;writing&quot;, with the Hebrew word for &quot;psalm&quot;, () or its Aramaic equivalent ().

An alternate, less accepted origin for the title in this sense is that it is a corruption of the Hebrew () meaning &quot;song, music&quot; or (), meaning &quot;story.&quot;

==Mention in the Quran==
In the Qur&#x27;an, the Zabur is mentioned by name three times. The Qur&#x27;an itself says nothing about the Zabur specifically, except that it was revealed to Dawud and that in the Zabur is written &quot;My servants the righteous, shall inherit the earth&quot;.



==Connection to the Psalms==
In the Quran and Urdu translation of the Bible, the Zabur refers to the Psalms. The Quran 21:105 says that in the Zabur there is a quote &quot;the land is inherited by my righteous servants&quot;. This resembles the 29th verse of Psalm 37, which says &quot;[t]he righteous shall inherit the land, and abide forever in it.&quot;

Ahrens supports the view that al-Anbiya 105 is quoting from the Psalms (1930). He says that the verse in the Qur&#x27;an reads, &quot;We have written in the Zabur after the reminder that My righteous servants shall inherit the earth.&quot; His conclusion is that this verse represents a close and rare linguistic parallel with the Hebrew Bible and, more pointedly, with Psalm 37 ascribed specifically to David (see wording in verses ).

==In Hadith==
One hadith, considered valid by Muhammad al-Bukhari, says:
==Ketuvim==
Christian apologist Karl Gottlieb Pfander suggested that the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s reference to Zabur actually refers to the third division of the Hebrew Scriptures, known as the Writings or Ketuvim, a broader grouping of Jewish holy books encompassing the Psalms and other collections of Hebrew literature and poetry.

<text>The Pedetidae are a family of rodents. The two living species, the springhares, are distributed throughout much of southern Africa and also around Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Fossils have been found as far north as Turkey. Together with the anomalures and zenkerella, Pedetidae forms the suborder Anomaluromorpha. The fossil genus &quot;Parapedetes&quot; is also related.

== Taxonomy ==
The family includes one living genus and four extinct genera. The Asian fossil &quot;Diatomys&quot; was previously included, but is now classified in the family Diatomyidae with the Laotian rock rat.

<text>Pedetes is a genus of rodent, the springhares, in the family Pedetidae. Members of the genus are distributed across southern and Eastern Africa.

==Species==
A number of species both extant and extinct are classified in the genus &quot;Pedetes&quot;. They include:
* South African springhare or &quot;springhaas&quot; (&quot;Pedetes capensis&quot;)
* East African springhare (&quot;Pedetes surdaster&quot;)
* &quot;Pedetes laetoliensis&quot; (Pliocene fossil)

Throughout the 20th century, the living species (and occasionally the prehistoric one) were merged into &quot;P. capensis&quot;, making the genus monotypic.

==Ecology==
These rodents are generally nocturnal and sleep through the day in burrows they dig. They feed on foliage, roots and other vegetable matter, and occasionally arthropods. Outside the burrow they usually move around by hopping on their hind legs.

When only one springhare species was recognized, it was listed as vulnerable by the IUCN in 1996 due to an approximately 20% decrease in the population over the previous ten years. This has been caused by intense hunting and the loss of habitat. However, the negative trend has not persisted, and both species are now listed as Species of Least Concern.

<text>John Hancock (October 24, 1824 – July 19, 1893) was an American judge and politician. As a member of the Texas Legislature he opposed the secession of Texas during the American Civil War. After the war he represented Texas in the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life==

John Hancock was born in Jackson County, Alabama, the seventh of ten children born to John Allen Hancock and Sarah Ryan Hancock. His older brother George Duncan Hancock was a veteran of Battle of San Jacinto and represented Travis County in the Eleventh Texas Legislature.

Hancock attended the East Tennessee University at Knoxville. He later worked on his father&#x27;s farm in Alabama before beginning his study of law in Winchester, Tennessee. In 1846 he was admitted to the Alabama bar. In January 1847 he moved to Austin, Texas, where he practiced law. In 1851 he was elected district judge of the Second Judicial District for a term of six years. After four years he resigned to resume his lucrative law practice, as well as to engage in farming.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Hancock strongly believed that Texas should remain part of the Union. In 1860 he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Unionist. After the secession of Texas in March 1861, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Confederate States of America and was expelled from the legislature. During the Civil War he practiced law in the state courts but refused to conduct business or recognize the authority in the Confederate courts. He refused to take part in military service during the war, and in 1864 he fled to Mexico to escape conscription for the Confederacy. After the end of the war he returned to Texas and took part in the restoration of order, including serving as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1866.

==Post war years==

In 1870 he was elected to the United States Congress and served from 1871 to 1877. He served again from 1883 to 1885. He supported the Native American policy of Ulysses S. Grant, which called for placing Native Americans on reservations under supervision of the federal government. While in Congress he helped in the passage of acts related to Native American policy. These acts included changing the manner of issuing rations to Native Americans on the reservations, stipulating that they were to be given once a week, as well as prohibiting Native American hunting-parties unless accompanied by United States Army troops. This latter policy ended raids by Native Americans from the reservations. He also helped establish a military telegraph around the Texas frontier.

==Death==

He died in Austin in 1893 and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==
On the eighth season of Who Do You Think You Are?, actress and comedian Aisha Tyler learned that Congressman John Hancock was her great-great-great-grandfather. Hancock fathered two sons with one of his slaves. The older, surviving son, Hugh Hancock, is through whom Tyler is descended. Hugh Hancock would become a prominent leader of the Austin African-American community. Active in the local Republican Party, Hugh ran a bar called the Black Elephant. Hugh Berry Hancock died in Pocatello, Idaho

<text>Silverclaw (Maria De Guadalupe &quot;Lupe&quot; Santiago) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a reserve member of the Avengers and regards Edwin Jarvis as an uncle figure.

==Publication history==

Silverclaw first appeared in &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #8 (September 1998), and was created by writer Kurt Busiek and artist George Pérez.

==Fictional character biography==
Maria de Guadalupe Santiago was born near the village of the Kamekeri in the country of Costa Verde. The Kamekeri formerly worshiped their own pantheon of gods until Spanish missionaries taught them Christianity. As a result, most of the Kamekari&#x27;s gods left them, except for the volcano goddess Peliali, who vowed to remain with and protect them.

Lupe is the daughter of Jaime Santiago, who studied the ancient beliefs and pantheon and claimed that she was the daughter of him and Peliali. At a young age, she developed the ability to transform into various animals, leading her to be ostracized.

Following Jaime&#x27;s death, Lupe is taken to live in an orphanage sponsored by Edwin Jarvis. The two regularly communicate and become friends, with Lupe regarding him as an adoptive uncle.

Years later, Lupe comes to the United States to attend Empire State University and meet Jarvis. However, her plane is hijacked by terrorists led by Moses Magnum. She works with the Avengers to stop them and becomes an honorary member of the group.

Silverclaw later discovers that the wizard Kulan Gath has conquered Costa Verde and intends to kill Peliali to gain her power. She and the Avengers manage to stop him, but are unable to stop him from killing Peliali. Afterwards, Silverclaw becomes a full member of the Avengers.

In &quot;Civil War&quot;, Silverclaw battles Ms. Marvel when she attempts to make her support the Superhuman Registration Act. She is later captured by the Puppet Master before Marvel frees her.

Silverclaw&#x27;s last major appearance is in the &quot;Hulk&quot; story arc &quot;Mayan Rule&quot;, where she helps battle the Mayapan, a group of Inhumans who pose as gods.

==Powers and abilities==
Silverclaw possesses the superhuman ability to mimic the physical characteristics of various animals native to rainforests and jungles, which includes jaguars, anacondas, cockatoos, monkeys, sloths, pumas, cheetahs, and crocodiles.

==Reception==

George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked Silverclaw as the sixth worst Avengers member, describing her story as &quot;a little better than Triathlon&#x27;s, but the character was infinitely lamer&quot; and that she had the power to &quot;dress like an extra from a Tarzan film&quot;. Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked her 20 out of 85 when ranking every Avenger, calling her an uninteresting character but praising her unusual powers.

<doc id="1162964" wikidata="Q7767279" url="?curid=1162964" title="The Summit (Alabama)">
<text>The Summit, which opened in October 1997, is a 1 million square foot (93,000 m2) upscale lifestyle center located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 280 and Interstate 459 in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, between the suburbs of Mountain Brook and Vestavia Hills.

==Development==
Bayer Properties, the owner and developer of the center, planned its construction over multiple phases. The first phase was a collection of 30 retailers and restaurants including Parisian (now Belk) and Barnes &amp; Noble that originally opened with the center in 1997. The second phase included an additional 20 retailers including Gap in 1999. The third phase was opened in 2001 with the anchor of Saks Fifth Avenue. The fourth phase opened in 2005 and includes some 20 to 30 additional retailers and restaurants, bringing the center to nearly 1 million square feet (93,000 m2). A fifth expansion will include a luxury hotel and 15 story condo tower, in addition to extra retail space.

In 2000, the center averaged US$500 in retail sales per square foot (US$5380 per sq m), compared to a national average of US$358 (US$3852 per sq m) that same year. In promotional literature that the developer provides to prospective retail tenants, Bayer claims that customers currently spend $117 per visit, compared to a national average of $87.

Bayer Properties has trademarked the brand &quot;The Summit&quot; and is in process of building other centers featuring the Summit name brand in other markets. The first of these opened in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2001, while another center in Reno, Nevada, opened in 2007. Additional Summit lifestyle centers are being developed in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, Lexington, Kentucky, and suburban Atlanta.

==Lawsuit against Belk==
When Belk took over the Parisian chain from Saks and announced plans to convert Parisian stores to the Belk nameplate, Bayer filed a lawsuit against Belk, contending that the Belk brand was not as upscale as Parisian, and that the conversion violated a covenant requiring Belk to occupy the space with a &quot;first-class&quot; retail store. The suit was settled in 2007. Terms of the settlement were not made public, but Belk did announce plans to make the store a &quot;flagship&quot; store — its first such location outside North Carolina, and third overall in the chain — with upgraded brand names and lines over and above their standard offerings. The name change took place in September 2007.

<text>The Communist Party of Canada (Saskatchewan) was a communist party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was the Saskatchewan section of the Communist Party of Canada.

The party nominated candidates for the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in provincial elections between 1938 and 1986. It ran three popular front candidates under the name &quot;Unity&quot; in 1938, electing two MLAs. It also ran two candidates under the Communist label, who failed to get elected. After the Communist Party was banned in the early years of World War II, it established the Labor-Progressive Party as its legal front, and ran candidates under that name throughout the 1940s and 1950s. It reverted to the Communist Party label in 1960.

<text>Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, Princess Royal () (born 2 April 1955) is a member of the Thai royal family. She is the second daughter of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit, and the younger sister of King Vajiralongkorn.

== Early life ==
=== Birth ===
Sirindhorn was born on 2 April 1955, at Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, Dusit Palace, the third child of King Bhumibol and Queen Mother Sirikit. As the royal couple has only one son, the Thai constitution was altered in 1974 to allow for female succession. This made Princess Sirindhorn second-in-line to the throne (after Vajiralongkorn) until the birth of Princess Bajrakitiyabha in 1978.

=== Early education ===
Sirindhorn attended Kindergarten, Primary and Secondary at Thailand&#x27;s most exclusive school: The Chitralada School which was established for the children of the Royal Family and Palace staff.

She ranked first in the National School Examinations in primary level (grade 7) in 1967, in upper secondary level (grade 12) in 1972, and fourth in the National University Entrance Examination in 1975.

=== Higher education ===

From 1976 she continued her studies in two graduate programs concurrently, obtaining a Master of Arts in Oriental Epigraphy (Sanskrit and Cambodian) in 1980 and also archaeology from Silpakorn University in 1980. From October 1977, she studied Sanskrit in Bangkok for two years under the tutelage of renowned Sanskrit scholar Satya Vrat Shastri. In 1978, she obtained a Master of Arts in Pali and Sanskrit from Chulalongkorn University.

In 1981 she enrolled in a doctoral program at Srinakharinwirot University, and was awarded a PhD in developmental education in 1987.

==Later life==
In December 2012, Sirindhorn was briefly hospitalised to remove calcium deposits.

More popular among the Thai public than her brother, then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, Sirindhorn was long rumoured to be a potential successor to the Thai throne. Upon Bhumibol&#x27;s death in 2016, the crown passed to Vajiralongkorn, now King Rama X. In 2019, she was bestowed the highest of royal ranks by appointment, &quot;Krom Somdej Phra,&quot; by King Vajiralongkorn. She also received a first-class King Rama X Royal Cypher Medal.

In January 2021, Sirindhorn was hospitalized after breaking both her ankles. Thai media reported that she fell during a walk; however, Western sources alleged that her ankles were broken by Vajiralongkorn after an argument.

== Works and interests ==

Aside from her passion for technology, she holds degrees in history and a doctorate in educational development. She teaches at the history department of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, where she is the nominal head of the department. In addition to Thai, she speaks fluent English, French and Mandarin Chinese, and is currently studying German and Latin. She translates Chinese literature into Thai.

She is also a skilled performer and avid promoter of Thai traditional music.

Like her father Bhumibol Adulyadej, Princess Sirindhorn holds a certificate as a radio amateur, with her call sign being HS1D.

== Scholarship ==
The University of Liverpool introduced a scholarship in honour of Sirindhorn. One full scholarship will be awarded annually to enable a Thai student to study at Liverpool to complete a one-year taught Masters programme. The scholarship is open to all subjects in which a one-year taught Masters programme is offered; however, priority will be given to those students who wish to study in a subject area associated with Princess Sirindhorn such as science, information technology, medicine, the arts, geography, history and languages. To be eligible for the scholarship, applicants must be a Thai national and already hold an offer to study a one-year taught Masters programme at the University of Liverpool.

<text>Traf-O-Data was a business partnership between Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Paul Gilbert that existed in the 1970s. The objective was to read the raw data from roadway traffic counters and create reports for traffic engineers. The company had only modest success but the experience was instrumental in the creation of Microsoft Corporation a few years later.

==Traffic counting==
State and local governments frequently perform traffic surveys with a pneumatic road tube traffic counter. Rubber hoses are stretched across a road and wheels of passing vehicles create air pulses that are recorded by a roadside counter. In the 1970s the counts were mechanically recorded on a roll of paper tape. The time and number of axles were punched as a 16-bit pattern into the paper tape. (The common Teletype paper tape uses only 7 bits.) Cities would hire private companies to translate the data into reports that traffic engineers could use to adjust traffic lights or improve roads.

Bill Gates and Paul Allen were high school students at Lakeside School in Seattle. The Lakeside Programmers Group got free computer time on various computers in exchange for writing computer programs. Gates and Allen thought they could process the traffic data cheaper and faster than the local companies by building a computer that could process all the traffic tapes using the Intel 8008 processor. The goal was to sell such machines to states and local governments as a time and cost-saving tool. 

Since Gates and Allen did not know how to build a computer capable of processing data on paper tapes, they recruited Paul Gilbert to help in building a prototype that can manually read the hole-patterns in the paper tape and transcribe the data onto computer cards. Gilbert became the third partner. Gates then used a computer at the University of Washington to produce the traffic flow charts. (Paul Allen&#x27;s father was a librarian at UW.) This was the beginning of Traf-O-Data.

==Traf-O-Data hardware==

The next step was to build a device to read the traffic tapes directly and eliminate the tedious manual work. The Intel 8008 microprocessor was announced in 1972 and they realized it could read the tapes and process the data. Allen had graduated and was enrolled at Washington State University. Since neither Gates nor Allen had any hardware design experience, they were initially stumped.

Gates and Allen had a friend, Paul Wennberg, who, like them, loitered at Control Data Corporation near the University of Washington, cadging open time on the mainframe computer. Wennberg, later the founder of the Triakis Corporation, was an electrical engineering student at the University of Washington. In the course of events Gates and Allen mentioned they were looking for somebody to build them a computer for free. They needed somebody good enough to build a computer from parts and the diagrams found in a computer magazine. Wennberg talked to his friend, Wes Prichard, who suggested to Wennberg that Gates and Allen head over to the UW Physics building, now known as Mary Gates Hall, to talk to Paul Gilbert, another electrical engineering student, who worked in the high-energy tracking laboratory. It was there that Paul Gilbert was approached by the duo to become a partner in Traf-O-Data.

That year Gilbert, piece by piece, wire-wrapped, soldered, and assembled from electrical components the working microcomputer. Miles Gilbert, Paul Gilbert&#x27;s brother, a graphic designer and draftsman, helped the fledgling company by designing the company&#x27;s logo. Gates and Allen started writing the software. To test the software while the computer was being designed, Paul Allen wrote a computer program on WSU&#x27;s PDP-10 that would emulate the 8008 microprocessor.

Although the plan had been to manufacture and sell the machines:
Later, the State of Washington offered free traffic processing services to cities, ending the need for private contractors, and all three principals moved on to other projects. The real contribution of Traf-O-Data was the experience that Gates and Allen gained, skills they used to write Altair BASIC for the MITS Altair 8800 computer:

<doc id="1162995" wikidata="Q3545872" url="?curid=1162995" title="Vance Astrovik">
<text>Vance Astrovik, also known as Justice and formerly known as Marvel Boy, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character possesses the superhuman power of telekinesis and has often been affiliated with the New Warriors and The Avengers. He appeared in &quot;Giant-Size Defenders&quot; #5 (July 1975) for the first time, which was created by Don Heck and Gerry Conway.

==Publication history==
More than a decade after his creation, Vance appeared first as a mainstay in the New Warriors and later in the third volume of the &quot;Avengers&quot; titles. He usually appeared with Firestar, who was his girlfriend and then fiancee.

In 1994, he had his own four-issue limited series, &quot;Justice: Four Balance&quot; and appeared in the &quot;I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions&quot; one-shot in 2006.

He was a major character in &quot;&quot; early in the series.

Justice appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through issue #20 (Dec. 2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Vance Astrovik was born in Saugerties, New York to Jewish parents.

He was visited as a teenager by an alternate, time-travelling version of his future self, Major Vance Astro of the Guardians of the Galaxy, an astronaut who had volunteered for an experimental space flight and consequently been lost in space in cryogenic suspension for a thousand years. The elder Vance Astro convinced his younger self not to become an astronaut and, in the process, sparked the premature emergence of the younger Vance&#x27;s telekinetic powers. Due to the vagaries of time travel in the Marvel Universe, this did not create a paradox but instead made the future world of the Guardians into a parallel timeline, to which they later returned. Although Major Vance Astro had not had a chance to fully develop his psionic power in his time in NASA, the younger Astrovik now had the opportunity to hone his power. Astrovik soon became the costumed crime-fighter Marvel Boy.

===Early adventures===
After his powers developed, Vance&#x27;s father, Arnold, began to physically abuse him for being &quot;different&quot;. Running away from home, Vance wound up supporting himself as a professional wrestler in the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, a circuit for superhuman competitors. While wrestling as &quot;Manglin&#x27; John Mahoney&quot;, he befriended Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing, who at the time was himself estranged from his &quot;family&quot;, the Fantastic Four. Eventually, Vance was convinced to return home, with assurances from his parents that the abuse would stop.

===New Warriors===
When Marvel Boy was rejected for membership in the Avengers by Captain America, he helped found a team of teenage superheroes, the New Warriors, led by the new hero Night Thrasher. He had many intense times during this early period, such as a fight against the White Queen, her Hellions, and the immortal villain Gideon. At the same time, Vance developed friendships with the other Warriors and a romantic relationship with teammate Firestar, and his powers increased both in strength and skill. However, his costumed activities renewed Arnold Astrovik&#x27;s prejudice towards Vance&#x27;s powers; both Vance and his mother suffered from Arnold&#x27;s abusive behavior, and Vance&#x27;s instinctively protecting himself with his powers only made things worse, with tragic consequences.

===Murder trial===
One night, Arnold Astrovik not only attacked a disadvantaged Vance (injured in a fight with Terrax and further injured by Gideon) but struck his wife when she tried to intervene. In one burst of his ever-growing superpowers and pent-up emotion, Vance lashed out at his abusive father and unintentionally killed him. Vance turned himself in and went to trial, charged with first-degree murder and negligent homicide. He was defended by attorney Foggy Nelson. The Thing was a character witness for Vance and helped establish the history of abuse that he suffered, as did Vance&#x27;s mother, Norma; other testimony established the good he had done as a costumed hero and his increasing competence with his powers. However, the prosecuting attorney pursued the latter angle, using testimony from Firestar and cross-examination of Norma Astrovik to establish that Vance could have used his powers to stop his father without lethal force. Finally, in her closing argument, the prosecutor drew a gun on Vance and fired a (unknown to Vance) blank round. Instinctively, Vance not only disarmed her but reacted so precisely that he contained the actual smoke from the gun, driving home the prosecution&#x27;s case. Vance was acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of negligent homicide. As a result of the trial, Vance&#x27;s secret identity became public knowledge.

Vance was sentenced to serve his time at the superhuman restraint facility known as the Vault. He was shown enjoying the occasional free walkabout on the long road trip to the Vault, joking and playing around with the officers. When his friends Firestar, Namorita, and Nova arrived to free him, Vance protested, declaring he would serve his time. He also said he was going to be paroled in fourteen months, so they would see him again then. Firestar, even though trying to remain restrained, was very upset, but she recognized what Vance wanted to do and came to terms with it.

During his stay in the Vault, he was granted &quot;training periods&quot; with the Guardsmen on duty, determined to hone his abilities to prevent another incident like his father&#x27;s death. When a riot broke out over the perception of poor living conditions, Vance helped calm the riot by convincing the warden to allow the plant-based villain Terraformer (once part of the Force of Nature) access to a plant. Despite the warden&#x27;s fears that Terraformer would use it in an escape attempt, the villain simply enjoyed it being with him. This calmed the other prisoners, and it was agreed that, on a case-by-case basis, their living conditions would be examined to accommodate superhuman prisoners&#x27; unique needs.

===Justice===
After his time in the Vault, he adopted the codename Justice. He briefly went undercover working with Shinobi Shaw to spy on the activities in the so-called &quot;Younghunt.&quot;

When the Sphinx, a previous Warriors foe, dispersed members of the team throughout history, Vance encountered his father as an adolescent. He discovered that Arnold, his father, was a homosexual who was bullied into accepting a heterosexual lifestyle by his own abusive father. Understanding that his father was as much a victim as he was, Vance attempted to change history by threatening his grandfather but stopped when he realized that he was, in his own way, perpetuating the cycle of violence handed down from father to son. Though history remained unchanged, this new knowledge allowed Vance to make a measure of peace with the memory of his father.

Justice spent some time in a leadership role with the New Warriors and talked about marriage with Firestar. However, when she learned her microwave powers might render her infertile, such plans were endangered.

===The Avengers===
A mystical incident had caused all those who were once Avengers to be targeted by creatures and monsters. Vance and Angelica accompanied their friend Rage, who had been an Avenger, to a meeting at Avengers Mansion. They willingly helped out in various ways before Morgan le Fay attacked, altering reality. Vance and Angelica were caught up in the literal mystical maelstrom and were turned into super-powered enforcers under the command of le Fay. However, several Avengers managed to break free of the control based on their deep belief in the team itself. Vance found himself coming to his senses despite never being an Avenger, a fact that surprised the remaining heroes; thus, he joined the resistance.

After the threat of le Fay was ended and the two proved themselves by defeating Whirlwind on their own, they managed to become Avengers. Although he was thrilled to be living his lifelong dream of being an Avenger, Vance made some small rookie mistakes at first, stemming from a case of hero-worship. However, he proved himself when he came up with a way to defeat the current plans of the current form (or forms) of the villain Ultron, despite a broken leg. Vance and Angelica then spent some time undercover investigating the Triune Understanding, a cult-like movement with seemingly good intentions but villainous leadership.

After the &quot;House of M&quot; ended, Justice and Firestar were unaffected by the global depowerment of mutants and thus retained their powers. Vance&#x27;s wish for more in their relationship, as opposed to Firestar&#x27;s wish for less (being ages 22 and 19, respectively), ended their engagement and their relationship.

===Civil War===
Justice and former teammate Rage learned that people were hunting down former New Warriors members because of perceived blame for the deaths caused by Nitro in Stamford, Connecticut, while fighting an incarnation of the team. They both sought out the legal services of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk) in protecting the allies of the New Warriors, as their identities were already publicly exposed. They eventually discovered that former New Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge (Hindsight) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates, operating a website that was slowly outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors.

Both Rage and Justice refused to go along with the proposed super-human registration act. This is further evidenced when they join Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers during the Civil War as a result of the death of Bill Foster.

===The Initiative===
After the Civil War, Justice was recruited by Iron Man to head the youth outreach arm of The Initiative superhero training program based at Camp Hammond. He is clearly unaware of some of the shadier aspects of the program, and is growing increasingly irritated by the Initiative &quot;Drill Sergeant&quot; Gauntlet&#x27;s constant demeaning and disparaging remarks about the deceased New Warriors. During the investigation of former New Warriors members due to an attack upon Gauntlet, it was revealed to readers that Justice is currently secretly seeing Ultra Girl, a trainee with the Initiative and former New Warriors associate.

Justice&#x27;s personal investigation into the fate of Initiative recruit MVP opened his eyes to the morally ambiguous activities of the Initiative, instituted by Camp Hammond director Henry Peter Gyrich. As a result, Justice apparently deserted from the Initiative to continue his investigation and recruited Ultra Girl, Rage, and other former New Warriors Debrii and Slapstick to his cause. After a clone of MVP goes rogue and leaves the Initiative with major casualties, Justice and these former New Warriors, along with the two surviving Scarlet Spiders, officially inform Iron Man of their intention to quit the Initiative and act as Counter Force, a form of independent oversight for the program; as the group is all registered superhumans, Iron Man is unable to act against Justice&#x27;s team unless they commit an illegal act. However, Ultra Girl decides to return to the Initiative, apparently ending her relationship with Justice.

===Secret Invasion===
During the Skrull invasion, Justice and Counter Force encounter Night Thrasher (Donyell Taylor) at the old New Warriors, looking for a DNA sample to prove whether or not the Night Thrasher that died at Stamford was a Skrull imposter. Counter Force initially believes that Donyell is a Skrull due to his reluctance to reveal his identity, and comes into conflict with Donyell&#x27;s New Warriors. When Donyell finally reveals his identity the two teams join together to storm the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier where the deceased New Warriors bodies were being held and recover them. The corpse of Night Thrasher is proven to be of human composition, and the two teams bury the bodies outside the old base.

===Dark Reign===
When Ragnarok, a deranged clone of Thor, attacks Camp Hammond, Counter Force (Now calling themselves &quot;The New Warriors&quot; and boasting Night Thrasher as a member) arrives to help. During the fight, Ragnarok kills one of the Scarlet Spiders and nearly kills Vance, who is saved by Ultra Girl. After the battle, Vance retrieves the corpse of the original MVP, seeking to give him a proper burial. However, their actions in exposing the duplicity to the public allowed H.A.M.M.E.R. director Norman Osborn to shut down Camp Hammond and reorganize the Initiative, placing villains on Initiative teams. The New Warriors rescued Gauntlet and Tigra from the Hood&#x27;s gang and formed the Avengers Resistance.

===Siege===
Things hit the tipping point for the Resistance when Osborn orchestrates a siege on Asgard by creating an incident similar to Stamford. Justice declares that while most of the Initiative is busy with the Siege, the Resistance will take down Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. in order to expose Osborn once and for all.

===Heroic Age===
Vance becomes one of the teaching staff of &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, alongside former Avengers teammates Hank Pym, Tigra, Quicksilver, and former New Warriors teammate Speedball. One of his students, Veil, has a secret crush on him until she finds out that he has renewed his relationship with Ultra Girl. His relationship with Ultra Girl is further complicated during the Avengers Academy Prom Night when Firestar appears.

During the &quot;Outlawed&quot; storyline, Vance appears as a member of C.R.A.D.L.E. when a law is passed that forbids superheroes who are below the age of 21.

==Powers and abilities==
Justice is a mutant who possesses telekinesis. By using his powers to lift himself, he can levitate and fly at high speed. He has shown the ability to hold a large number of people. Initially, Justice&#x27;s telekinesis was limited in its scope, and using them at the peak level of his power would cause him headaches and nosebleeds. However, his powers later increased dramatically, and he was no longer hindered by the physical symptoms he had once suffered from.

==Other versions==
The Vance Astrovik character in an alternate timeline became a founding member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, calling himself Vance Astro. Marvel has treated this as a separate character from the alternate Earth-691, and the two have even met on occasion.

==In other media==
* Vance Astrovik as Justice makes non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; as a member of the New Warriors.
* Vance Astrovik as Justice appears as a non-playable character in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Sean Donnellan.

<doc id="1163002" wikidata="Q3405048" url="?curid=1163002" title="Birdsong (novel)">
<text>Birdsong is a 1993 war novel and family saga by the English author Sebastian Faulks. It is Faulks&#x27;s fourth novel. The plot follows two main characters living at different times: the first is Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier on the front line in Amiens during the First World War, and the second is his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen&#x27;s experience of the war.

Faulks developed the novel to bring more public awareness to the experience of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on how the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, such as Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot; and those in Pat Barker&#x27;s Regeneration Trilogy.

&quot;Birdsong&quot; is part of a loose trilogy of novels by Sebastian Faulks, alongside &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot; and &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot;; the three are linked through location, history and several minor characters. &quot;Birdsong&quot; is one of Faulks&#x27;s best-received works, earning both critical and popular praise, including being listed as the 13th favourite book in Britain in a 2003 BBC survey called the Big Read. It has also been adapted three times under the same title: for radio (1997), the stage (2010) and television (2012).

==Background and publication==

Faulks wrote the novel partly because he felt that the First World War had not been discussed enough in both literary and historical contexts. Reflecting on the novel twenty years later, Faulks felt that the published version did not fully do justice to the experience of war: it did not provide readers with &quot;a full appreciation of the soldiers&#x27; physical experience; and, perhaps more importantly, a philosophical understanding of what it meant to be part of the first genocidal event of the century – the one that made the others imaginable&quot;.

Because Faulks felt that much of the extant World War I literature was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.

The novel was a success, with international impact and attention. The hardback print-run, first issued in 1993, sold 14,000 copies. The novel featured in many &quot;Best of the Year lists&quot; in the United Kingdom during 1993. Subsequently, the novel has become one of the most checked-out works from British libraries.

Though Faulks&#x27;s third published novel in the United Kingdom, &quot;Birdsong&quot; was only his second republished in the United States. In New Zealand and Australia, the novel was popular, reaching best seller and &quot;what&#x27;s hot&quot; lists. The novel was also sold in translation in Italy, France, Spain, Latin America, Germany, Portugal, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, Israel, Sweden, Estonia, Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Finland and the Netherlands. Globally, sales were strong, and as of 2010, the novel had sold over 3 million copies.

==Plot==
&quot;Birdsong&quot; has an episodic structure, and is split into seven sections which move between three different periods of time before, during and after the war in the Stephen Wraysford plot, and three different windows of time in the 1970s Benson plot.

===France 1910===

The first stage starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with René Azaire, his wife Isabelle and his children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He witnesses a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen&#x27;s interest in Isabelle, with whom he soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot have a child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food to the families of striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.

Stephen&#x27;s love of Isabelle transforms into a passionate affair. Isabelle confronts Azaire with the truth of their relationship and Azaire evicts Stephen. Isabelle leaves with him, running away to Southern France. There she becomes pregnant, and momentarily loses faith in her relationship with Stephen. Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle&#x27;s father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.

===France 1916===
The second section rejoins Stephen, when he is a lieutenant in the British Army at the start of the war. Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the first day on the Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Messines near Ypres in the following year.

Several episodes depict a downtrodden Stephen whose only respite is his friendship with Captain Michael Weir and his men. Stephen gains the reputation of a cold and distant officer. He refuses all offers of leave, because he is committed to fighting the war.

His story is interleaved with that of Jack Firebrace, a former miner employed with the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers in the British trenches to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the German trenches. In one expedition across No-Man&#x27;s Land, Stephen is badly injured but survives.

During these episodes, Stephen feels lonely and writes to Isabelle, feeling that there is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses that he has only ever loved her.

===England 1978===
Alongside the main story, there is the narrative of Stephen&#x27;s granddaughter, Elizabeth, who, whilst struggling with her already married boyfriend, Robert, unearths Stephen&#x27;s journals from World War I and seeks to learn about his experiences at Marne, Verdun and the Somme. She discovers that Stephen&#x27;s journals are encoded, but tries to decipher them.

===France 1917===

Stephen has a chance encounter with Jeanne, Isabelle&#x27;s sister, while on leave in Amiens. During this encounter, Stephen persuades her to allow him to meet with Isabelle. He meets her but finds her face disfigured by a shell with scarring from the injury. Stephen discovers that Isabelle is now in a relationship with Max, a German soldier.

Stephen returns to England briefly, and finds relief at being able to enjoy the Norfolk countryside away from the trenches. When he meets Jeanne again on the way back, he tells her how he dreads returning to the front line after leave. Weir, Stephen&#x27;s closest friend, is eventually killed by a sniper&#x27;s bullet while in a trench out on the front line.

===England 1978–1979===
Elizabeth continues researching the war and talks to war veterans Gray and Brennan (who knew Stephen) about their experiences. During this period, she also becomes pregnant with Robert&#x27;s child.

===France 1918===
The WWI plot ends with Stephen and Firebrace trapped underground after a German mine explosion; with their way out blocked, they talk and share their experiences, with Firebrace grieving for his dead son John and Stephen telling him of his former love for Isabelle. Stephen finds some explosives and Firebrace, himself close to death, tells him how to lay them in order to blast their way out of the tunnel. Before Stephen completes the task, Firebrace dies. The explosion successfully clears a way out for Stephen, and he is rescued by Levi, a Jewish German soldier, as the war ends.

===England 1979===
Elizabeth finally decides to reveal her pregnancy to her mother Françoise, who, to Elizabeth&#x27;s surprise, is supportive. Over dinner, she learns her mother was raised by Stephen and Jeanne, who married and settled in Norfolk after Elizabeth&#x27;s grandmother Isabelle&#x27;s premature death due to the postwar influenza epidemic. Elizabeth and the still-married Robert go on holiday to Dorset, where she goes into labour and has a son, naming him John (after Jack Firebrace&#x27;s late son). The book ends with Robert walking down the garden of the holiday cottage and having an immense sense of joy.

==Characters==

However, after this brief affair Isabelle agrees to return to René (after René is convinced by Isabelle&#x27;s father) and she is forgiven by the family. She is the mother of Françoise by Stephen, though she raised her daughter originally with a German soldier named Max.
* Lisette – Sixteen-year-old daughter of Azaire, and step-daughter of Isabelle. Lisette is attracted to Stephen, to whom she is nearer in age than Isabelle. She makes suggestive remarks to Stephen throughout his time at the house in Amiens, but goes on to marry a man named Lucien Lebrun.

==Themes==
===Recovering history===
The novel deals explicitly with the contemporary act of recovering the memory of WWI, and compiling contemporary understanding of those narratives—a function common to works of historiographic metafiction, like Pat Barker&#x27;s Regeneration Trilogy, A.S. Byatt&#x27;s &quot;Possession,&quot; and Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot;. The literary scholar Jerome de Groot calls &quot;Birdsong&quot; one of the first novels of its kind, creating a trend in the 1990s of literary fiction rethinking and reflecting on the World Wars and their historical legacy.

Michael Gorra, a professor of English literature, argues that Faulks seeks to demonstrate that &quot;the past can be recovered, its code can be broken; it can be used to add meaning to contemporary life. Its limitations can be overcome and its promises fulfilled because we know it can heal.&quot; The deliberate hiding of Stephen&#x27;s stories, remaining silent to his family after the war&#x27;s end and encoding his journals, mirrors the actual loss of record and stories from veterans in post-war Britain. Elizabeth&#x27;s search for that history is a process of recovering that memory in order to gain a greater emotional relationships with her grandfather, to whom she had never felt connected. Writing in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, the medical doctor Paul Slade described reading about this investigation of another person&#x27;s history to illuminate how &quot;superficial&quot; his own patient histories practice had been.

Gorra described the novel&#x27;s split into parallel narratives as the critical fault in the reading experience of the novel. For de Groot, however, the split structure provides one of the most sophisticated elements of the novel. De Groot writes that Benson&#x27;s investigation of personal history allows Faulks to examine the difference between the two perspectives on the memory, highlighting the &quot;unknowability of the horror of war&quot; and of history more generally.

===Trauma===
Like other novels documenting WWI, the shock and trauma of death is embedded throughout the book&#x27;s depiction of the war. John Mullen, reviewing the book for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described the depictions of the Battle of the Somme particularly brutal. According to scholar Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż, Faulks treats the war as a way to &quot;test human endurance&quot; and explore the effect of carnage on the psyche. A reviewer for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; also highlighted this theme, writing that &quot;the war, here, is Faulks&#x27;s real subject, his stories of destroyed lives, however wrenching, only throwing its horror into greater relief and making it the more unbearable&quot;.

The contemporary historian Simon Wessley describes the novel, alongside Barker&#x27;s &quot;Regeneration&quot;, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses the experience of the World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD. De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a thematic subject.

The historian Ross J. Wilson noted that this reinvestigation of the traumas of the World Wars revisits and revives the experience of trauma within contemporary culture. Faulks uses both different narrators and different narrative perspectives (first, third and omniscient) on the death in the trenches to explore the trauma of death in numerous and challenging ways. For Mullen, this gives the effect of &quot;[t]he novelist painfully manipulat[ing] the reader&#x27;s emotions.&quot;

==Style==
The novel frequently changes narrative perspectives, using a significant amount of interior monologue, direct speech and dramatic irony. Though employing an omniscient narrator who occasionally describes the events from a broad perspective, the novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely, principally Stephen Wraysford, Isabelle Azair, Michael Weir, Jack Firebrace and Elizabeth Benson.

Pat Wheeler, a scholar of literature, describes the narrative style as &quot;both naturalistic and realistic and very much in the manner of the nineteenth century writers [Faulks] cites as literary influences&quot;—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler emphasizes that the naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the &quot;human&quot; parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel&#x27;s imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel &quot;produces a vivid and traumatizing description of the sights and sounds of life and death in (and under the trenches)&quot;; the principal cause of this, he says, is &quot;the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Birdsong&quot; is one of Faulks&#x27;s best-received works of fiction, both by the public and amongst reviewers. The British press offered considerable praise, with positive reviews from &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Express&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. American and other international press reviews were similarly positive.

The novel&#x27;s popular reception was similarly positive. &quot;Birdsong&quot; came 13th in a 2003 BBC survey called the Big Read, which aimed to find Britain&#x27;s favourite book. It received an &quot;Also Mentioned&quot; credit in &quot;The Observer&quot; 2005 poll of critics and writers to find the &quot;Best British book of the last 25 years&quot; (1980–2005). &quot;Birdsong&quot; was listed in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as one of the most consistently high selling books of 1998–2008, continuously in the top 5,000 sales figures.

Reviews of the novel often focus on the fluid reading experience as well as the novel&#x27;s effective treatment of &quot;&#x27;real&#x27; people&quot; within the trauma of war. Gorra describes the novel as mostly a strong WWI novel, characterising it as &quot;superb&quot; with prose that is &quot;spare and precise&quot;. The review published in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was glowing: &quot;Once more, Faulks shows his unparalleled strengths as a writer of plain human life and high, high compassion. A wonderful book, ringing with truth.&quot;

Consistently one of the greatest criticisms of the novel concerns its 1970s plot-line. For example, Gorra found that the addition of a parallel narrative &quot;[ran] into problems&quot;—especially concerning Elizabeth Benson, whom he &quot;stopped believing in [as a] character&quot;. Unlike other reviewers, the critic Sarah Belo did not question the historical investigation plot, but the depiction of Elizabeth&#x27;s experience as a 1970s woman in England. On the other hand, almost all of the reviewers describe the novel&#x27;s war sections as excellently written; for example, the review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the sections &quot;so powerful as to be almost unbearable&quot;.

The novel has been favourably compared to other World War I and II novels, including &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, &quot;The Young Lions&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance.&quot; Gorra described the novel as even more original than Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost Road&quot; and the rest of her Regeneration Trilogy. Kate Saunders, reviewing &quot;Birdsong&quot; for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, praised the novel and described it as &quot;without the political cynicism that colours more modern treatments of this catastrophe&quot;. Reviewers have also compared the novel to other literary works; for example, for one critic, the lead up to the Somme was as persuasive as the &quot;scene in &quot;Henry V&quot; before the Battle of Agincourt&quot;, while the novelist Suzanne Ruta writes that Faulks creates characters with a similar depth to those in Thomas Hardy novels.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Birdsong&quot; was adapted as a radio drama of the same title in 1997, and as a stage play in 2010. The play adaptation was first directed by Trevor Nunn at the Comedy Theatre in London.

In 2012 it was adapted as a two-part television drama for the BBC. The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and was directed by Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;War Horse&quot; as a successful evocation of the experience of the World War I trenches.

In both 2013 and 2014, Faulks indicated that a feature film adaptation was in development. The screenplay is by Rupert Wyatt, and the film is expected to star Nicholas Hoult.

In 2020, Original Theatre produced an online film version of the novel, that featured Faulks as the narrator.

Rickie D. Moore is an American renewal theologian within the Pentecostal movement. He is now the Associate Dean of the Lee University School of Religion.

Moore received a B.A. from Lee College in 1976, his M.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1982 and a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt in 1988. He is an ordained bishop of the Church of God, and was appointed to the faculty of the Church of God Theological Seminary in 1982, becoming Professor of Old Testament Studies.

Moore&#x27;s Vanderbilt University Ph.D. dissertation on the Elisha Stories in II Kings was revised and published with Sheffield Academic Press under the title, &quot;God Saves: Lessons From the Elisha Stories&quot;. Together with his seminary colleagues, John Christopher Thomas and Steven Jack Land, Moore is a founding editor of the &quot;Journal of Pentecostal Theology&quot;, the first academic series ever to feature constructive theology from a Pentecostal perspective on an international, scholarly level. Moore received a major research grant in 1994 by the Association of Theological Schools to study the relationship of charisma and canon in the Old Testament.

<doc id="1163024" wikidata="Q1344046" url="?curid=1163024" title="First-class function">
<text>In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures. Some programming language theorists require support for anonymous functions (function literals) as well. In languages with first-class functions, the names of functions do not have any special status; they are treated like ordinary variables with a function type. The term was coined by Christopher Strachey in the context of &quot;functions as first-class citizens&quot; in the mid-1960s.

First-class functions are a necessity for the functional programming style, in which the use of higher-order functions is a standard practice. A simple example of a higher-ordered function is the &quot;map&quot; function, which takes, as its arguments, a function and a list, and returns the list formed by applying the function to each member of the list. For a language to support &quot;map&quot;, it must support passing a function as an argument.

There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments or returning them as results, especially in the presence of non-local variables introduced in nested and anonymous functions. Historically, these were termed the funarg problems, the name coming from &quot;function argument&quot;. In early imperative languages these problems were avoided by either not supporting functions as result types (e.g. ALGOL 60, Pascal) or omitting nested functions and thus non-local variables (e.g. C). The early functional language Lisp took the approach of dynamic scoping, where non-local variables refer to the closest definition of that variable at the point where the function is executed, instead of where it was defined. Proper support for lexically scoped first-class functions was introduced in Scheme and requires handling references to functions as closures instead of bare function pointers, which in turn makes garbage collection a necessity.

== Concepts ==

In this section, we compare how particular programming idioms are handled in a functional language with first-class functions (Haskell) compared to an imperative language where functions are second-class citizens (C).

=== Higher-order functions: passing functions as arguments ===

In languages where functions are first-class citizens, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions in the same way as other values (a function taking another function as argument is called a higher-order function). In the language Haskell:

map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
Languages where functions are not first-class often still allow one to write higher-order functions through the use of features such as function pointers or delegates. In the language C:

void map(int (*f)(int), int x[], size_t n) {
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
 x[i] = f(x[i]);


There are a number of differences between the two approaches that are &quot;not&quot; directly related to the support of first-class functions. The Haskell sample operates on lists, while the C sample operates on arrays. Both are the most natural compound data structures in the respective languages and making the C sample operate on linked lists would have made it unnecessarily complex. This also accounts for the fact that the C function needs an additional parameter (giving the size of the array.) The C function updates the array in-place, returning no value, whereas in Haskell data structures are persistent (a new list is returned while the old is left intact.) The Haskell sample uses recursion to traverse the list, while the C sample uses iteration. Again, this is the most natural way to express this function in both languages, but the Haskell sample could easily have been expressed in terms of a fold and the C sample in terms of recursion. Finally, the Haskell function has a polymorphic type, as this is not supported by C we have fixed all type variables to the type constant codice_1.

=== Anonymous and nested functions ===

In languages supporting anonymous functions, we can pass such a function as an argument to a higher-order function:

main = map (\x -&gt; 3 * x + 1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In a language which does not support anonymous functions, we have to bind it to a name instead:

int f(int x) {
 return 3 * x + 1;

int main() {
 int list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 map(f, list, 5);


=== Non-local variables and closures ===
Once we have anonymous or nested functions, it becomes natural for them to refer to variables outside of their body (called &quot;non-local variables&quot;):

main = let a = 3
 b = 1
 in map (\x -&gt; a * x + b) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
If functions are represented with bare function pointers, we can not know anymore how the value that is outside of the function&#x27;s body should be passed to it, and because of that a closure needs to be built manually. Therefore we can not speak of &quot;first-class&quot; functions here.
typedef struct {
 int (*f)(int, int, int);
 int a;
 int b;
} closure_t;

void map(closure_t *closure, int x[], size_t n) {
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
 x[i] = (closure-&gt;f)(closure-&gt;a, closure-&gt;b, x[i]);

int f(int a, int b, int x) {
 return a * x + b;

void main() {
 int l[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 int a = 3;
 int b = 1;
 closure_t closure = {f, a, b};
 map(&amp;closure, l, 5);


Also note that the codice_2 is now specialized to functions referring to two codice_1s outside of their environment. This can be set up more generally, but requires more boilerplate code. If codice_4 would have been a nested function we would still have run into the same problem and this is the reason they are not supported in C.

=== Higher-order functions: returning functions as results ===
When returning a function, we are in fact returning its closure. In the C example any local variables captured by the closure will go out of scope once we return from the function that builds the closure. Forcing the closure at a later point will result in undefined behaviour, possibly corrupting the stack. This is known as the upwards funarg problem.

=== Assigning functions to variables ===
Assigning functions to variables and storing them inside (global) datastructures potentially suffers from the same difficulties as returning functions.

f :: Integer] -&gt; [Integer
f = let a = 3
 b = 1
 in [map (\x -&gt; a * x + b), map (\x -&gt; b * x + a)]
=== Equality of functions ===

As one can test most literals and values for equality, it is natural to ask whether a programming language can support testing functions for equality. On further inspection, this question appears more difficult and one has to distinguish between several types of function equality:

; Extensional equality: Two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are considered extensionally equal if they agree on their outputs for all inputs (∀&quot;x&quot;. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)). Under this definition of equality, for example, any two implementations of a stable sorting algorithm, such as insertion sort and merge sort, would be considered equal. Deciding on extensional equality is undecidable in general and even for functions with finite domains often intractable. For this reason no programming language implements function equality as extensional equality.

; Intensional equality: Under intensional equality, two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are considered equal if they have the same &quot;internal structure&quot;. This kind of equality could be implemented in interpreted languages by comparing the source code of the function bodies (such as in Interpreted Lisp 1.5) or the object code in compiled languages. Intensional equality implies extensional equality (assuming the functions are deterministic and have no hidden inputs, such as the program counter or a mutable global variable.)

; Reference equality: Given the impracticality of implementing extensional and intensional equality, most languages supporting testing functions for equality use reference equality. All functions or closures are assigned a unique identifier (usually the address of the function body or the closure) and equality is decided based on equality of the identifier. Two separately defined, but otherwise identical function definitions will be considered unequal. Referential equality implies intensional and extensional equality. Referential equality breaks referential transparency and is therefore not supported in pure languages, such as Haskell.

== Type theory ==

In type theory, the type of functions accepting values of type &quot;A&quot; and returning values of type &quot;B&quot; may be written as &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; or &quot;B&quot;&quot;A&quot;. In the Curry–Howard correspondence, function types are related to logical implication; lambda abstraction corresponds to discharging hypothetical assumptions and function application corresponds to the modus ponens inference rule. Besides the usual case of programming functions, type theory also uses first-class functions to model associative arrays and similar data structures.

In category-theoretical accounts of programming, the availability of first-class functions corresponds to the closed category assumption. For instance, the simply typed lambda calculus corresponds to the internal language of Cartesian closed categories.

== Language support ==
Functional programming languages, such as Erlang, Scheme, ML, Haskell, F#, and Scala, all have first-class functions. When Lisp, one of the earliest functional languages, was designed, not all aspects of first-class functions were then properly understood, resulting in functions being dynamically scoped. The later Scheme and Common Lisp dialects do have lexically scoped first-class functions.

Many scripting languages, including Perl, Python, PHP, Lua, Tcl/Tk, JavaScript and Io, have first-class functions.

For imperative languages, a distinction has to be made between Algol and its descendants such as Pascal, the traditional C family, and the modern garbage-collected variants. The Algol family has allowed nested functions and higher-order taking function as arguments, but not higher-order functions that return functions as results (except Algol 68, which allows this). The reason for this was that it was not known how to deal with non-local variables if a nested-function was returned as a result (and Algol 68 produces runtime errors in such cases).

The C family allowed both passing functions as arguments and returning them as results, but avoided any problems by not supporting nested functions. (The gcc compiler allows them as an extension.) As the usefulness of returning functions primarily lies in the ability to return nested functions that have captured non-local variables, instead of top-level functions, these languages are generally not considered to have first-class functions.

Modern imperative languages often support garbage-collection making the implementation of first-class functions feasible. First-class functions have often only been supported in later revisions of the language, including C# 2.0 and Apple&#x27;s Blocks extension to C, C++, and Objective-C. C++11 has added support for anonymous functions and closures to the language, but because of the non-garbage collected nature of the language, special care has to be taken for non-local variables in functions to be returned as results (see below).
; C++: C++11 closures can capture non-local variables by copy construction, by reference (without extending their lifetime), or by move construction (the variable lives as long as the closure does). The first option is safe if the closure is returned but requires a copy and cannot be used to modify the original variable (which might not exist any more at the time the closure is called). The second option potentially avoids an expensive copy and allows to modify the original variable but is unsafe in case the closure is returned (see dangling references). The third option is safe if the closure is returned and does not require a copy but cannot be used to modify the original variable either.
; Java: Java 8 closures can only capture final or &quot;effectively final&quot; non-local variables. Java&#x27;s function types are represented as Classes. Anonymous functions take the type inferred from the context. Method references are limited. For more details, see .
; Lisp
: Lexically scoped Lisp variants support closures. Dynamically scoped variants do not support closures or need a special construct to create closures.
: In Common Lisp, the identifier of a function in the function namespace cannot be used as a reference to a first-class value. The special operator codice_5 must be used to retrieve the function as a value: codice_6 evaluates to a function object. codice_7 exists as a shorthand notation. To apply such a function object, one must use the codice_8 function: codice_9.
; Python
: Explicit partial application with codice_10 since version 2.5, and codice_11 since version 2.6.
; Ruby
: The identifier of a regular &quot;function&quot; in Ruby (which is really a method) cannot be used as a value or passed. It must first be retrieved into a codice_12 or codice_13 object to be used as first-class data. The syntax for calling such a function object differs from calling regular methods.
: Nested method definitions do not actually nest the scope.
: Explicit currying with codice_14.

<text>Modlin Fortress () is one of the largest 19th-century fortresses in Poland. It is located in the town of Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki in district Modlin on the Narew river, approximately 50 kilometers north of Warsaw. It was originally constructed by the French from 1806 to 1812.

== History ==
The strategic importance of the area limited by the Vistula, Bug, Wkra and Narew was known to various armies throughout the ages. The first fortified stronghold was built in Zakroczym by the Piast dynasty in the 11th century. 

The first modern fortifications in the area of today&#x27;s citadel were built by the forces of the Polish Masovian troops, which established a camp here in September 1655 to defend against the Swedish invasion. These were fortified artillery positions defending the crossings over the Vistula and Bugonarew, and a moat protecting the camp from the east. During the Battle of Nowy Dwór, Polish forces blocked the crossing of Swedish troops for ten days, then, forced to retreat by Swedish artillery fire, they broke away from the enemy, using the fortifications and terrain obstacles, avoiding destruction.

Next modern fortified position was built there in 1656 by the Swedish armies during The Deluge. The so-called &quot;Bugskansen&quot; was a star-shaped fortified military camp, located probably close to the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula, at the so-called &quot;Swedish Island&quot;. The camp was also guarding a wooden bridge over the Vistula prior to the battle of Zakroczym and served as the main supply depot of the Swedish army during the battle of Warsaw of July 1656. After the Swedish defeat the fort was demolished in 1660 and the area remained unfortified for roughly 150 years.

After the Partitions of Poland the area was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Shortly afterward Jan Pieter van Suchtelen, a Dutch military engineer in Russian service prepared a construction plan for a mighty fortress in the area, named after the nearby town of Zakroczym. The fort was to be a bastion fortress, located approximately 1.5 km from the rivers and with several forts guarding the area from the west. However, the project was never accomplished as in 1806 the area became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, a rump Polish state created by and allied to Napoleon Bonaparte.

From the very beginning of French presence in Poland, Bonaparte&#x27;s engineers started to fortify the border with Russia, expecting either a Russian offensive towards western Europe – or a future offensive of the French armies towards Petersburg and Moscow. In December 1806, while in Poznań, Napoleon ordered a fort to be built on two islands located at the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula. The fortification was to be temporary and was to become primarily a supply depot and a huge granary, serving as a supply centre for the forces operating in Poland or Russia. The construction started almost immediately, although Chief Engineer of the French forces Gen. François de Chasseloup-Laubat decided to build the fortress on the northern bank of the river rather than on the islands. The work started in early 1807, yet went on very slowly. It was not until the following year that the pace was speeded up and in 1809 the first casemates and walls were ready. It was there that the core of the Polish Army was stationed after the Battle of Raszyn against the invading forces of Austria. Soon after the outer rim of defences on the right bank of the Vistula was ready. It ran more or less along the inner line of modern fortifications. It consisted of a semi-circular earthwork reinforced with wooden stockade and five bastions. In addition, the area was guarded by two fortified bridgeheads, one in Kazuń on the left bank of the Vistula and the other next to Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki.

In 1810 the very concept of the fort was changed and Napoleon decided to turn Modlin into a pivotal fortress in his line of fortifications and expand it significantly by adding an outer rim of defenses. General de Chasseloup-Laubat was replaced with a famous French engineer Jean Mallet de Granville (later a naturalized Pole under the name of &quot;Jan Malletski&quot;), aided by Gen. François Haxo. It is not certain whether the authors of the expansion were the two to supervise its construction, or Napoleon himself. The works continued on a very fast pace as Napoleon was planning his campaign in Russia and envisioned Modlin to become the main fortress behind his lines. By September 1811 more than 19,000 people were taking part in the works. Because of that the authorities of the Duchy of Warsaw were considering to grant Modlin with a city charter, which however did not succeed. Although the following year, shortly before the outbreak of the Franco-Russian War, the number of workers exceeded 20 thousands, the fortress was never fully completed.

The French plans included a fortified area composed of three, semi-independent fortifications. The main line of defences was located on the right bank of Vistula and Narew, and was composed of a polygonal fortification with 4 bastions and 3 linking ravelins (one facing the Utrata river, one facing the village of Modlin and one in the centre). The ravelins were between 800 and 1000 meters away from the main line of fortifications, in order to reinforce the defenses against new models of heavy artillery. The second part of the fortress was the Kazuń bridgehead on the left bank of the Vistula, composed of a single ravelin. The third was a redoubt located between Vistula and Narew and the fourth was an artillery nest located on the &quot;Swedish Island&quot;. Among the engineers to supervise the construction were also Gen. Ignacy Prądzyński, Gen. Prevo-Vernois and Lt. Col. Filip Mięciszewski. After the defeat of the Grande Armée at Moscow, the fortress was taken over by the forces of the Duchy of Warsaw. On 5 February 1813 the Russian army of 36,000 soldiers arrived to the fortress and laid siege to it. The Polish forces under Dutch general Herman Willem Daendels defended the fortress until 1 December 1813. It was the last of the French fortresses along the Vistula to capitulate.

== Fortress in Congress Poland ==
After 1815 the fortress found itself in Congress Poland, a state which was a part of the Russian Empire, but had considerable autonomy and an army of its own. It was weakly manned by Polish and Russian units, and little new construction work was carried out. During the November Uprising of 1830 the fortress was prepared for defense by Polish units, but the Russian army did not storm it. It surrendered on 9 October 1831 as one of the last points controlled by Polish units during the uprising.

== Russian Fortress Novogeorgievsk ==
After the November Uprising of 1830 the Russian rule over Congress Poland became more severe. The Modlin fortress was renamed &quot;Novogeorgievsk&quot; in 1834 and during the years 1832–1841 underwent a huge expansion, to host garrison troops who were tasked with preventing another Polish uprising, as well as defend Russia&#x27;s western frontiers. It was part of the chain of fortresses which included Warsaw, Ivangorod, and Brest-Litovsk. The most notable new work built was a fortified barracks building 2,200 m in length, which was to serve as the last line of defense for the fortress. After 1841 construction work largely ceased, and over the next 40 years the fortress gradually became obsolete. However, in 1844 the large granary building was built at the estuary of the Narew River. Polish architect Jan Jakub Gay designed the granary not only for storing food, but also as a defensible position at the bridgehead of the rivers.

When relations between Germany and Russia deteriorated in the 1880s, with Germany entering the Triple Alliance potentially aimed against Russia, the decision was made to expand the fortress and upgrade it to modern standards. In the years 1883–1888 eight modern forts were added, roughly forming a ring with 2 to 4 km distance from the central fortress. In the following years these forts were modernized. At the same time, additional defensive works were built to integrate the fortress into the larger fortified region around Warsaw.

The defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War caused a rethinking of Russian strategy. In particular the idea of concentrating forces in the interior away from the borders before hostilities began to gain popularity. This approach would eliminate the need for a chain of border fortresses to screen the mobilizing units.

In 1909 when General Vladimir Sukhomlinov became the War Minister for the Russian Empire, one proposal he made was to scrap the bulk of the Russian fortress system, and Novogeorgievsk was a prime example of why they should be scrapped: The outer forts were initially built at a distance of about eight kilometers from the citadel to protect it from attacking artillery; by 1900, even field guns could fire past that distance. Sukhomlinov was overruled. Instead of being razed, the fort system was slated for an 800 million ruble upgrade with a new belt of forts to be added. The fortress was also to receive a large number of heavy artillery pieces. The intensive new construction work started in 1912 and continued almost until the German army approached the fortress in 1915 during World War I. The fortress was now designed to serve as a center of resistance deep behind enemy lines if the Russian army were forced to retreat from Poland. The works were carried out in great haste, not all equipment was fitted, and some construction materials were improvised and hence of lower quality. Even with these defects, the fortress with its nineteen forts was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe at the outbreak of World War I. The Russian high command expected that if surrounded by the German armies it would hold out for many months, serving as a major thorn in the German rear.

== Capture by the Germans ==
In summer of 1915, the Russians were reeling from the German attacks in Poland. They were faced with the reality of giving up Poland to the Germans or have their forces cut off from retreat.

The problem of the retreat was the abandonment of the fortresses especially Novogeorgievsk. Novogeorgievsk was seen as the &quot;symbol of Russian rule in Poland.&quot; It would also mean the abandonment of Poland, which would compromise their ability to negotiate for more territory if the Allies won.

Mikhail Alekseyev, the commander of the Polish sector, knew that to garrison the forts was a trap and the impregnability was an illusion. However, he was swayed by men of a higher social standing and left a garrison to defend Novogeorgievsk. The troops that he was able to spare were the remnants of the II. Siberian division, the 63rd division, and 58th division.

To capture Novogeorgievsk, the Germans transferred General Hans Beseler who had successfully laid siege to the Belgian city of Antwerp early in the war. In a stroke of luck, his forces captured the chief engineer of Novogeorgievsk on the first day. The Siege of Novogeorgievsk lasted only a matter of days. When it fell, the Germans captured 1,600 guns and close to a million shells.

== Post World War I ==
After the First World War Modlin became part of the Second Polish Republic and was modernized with modern bunkers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft equipment. Its main purpose was to provide cover for Warsaw from enemy attacks from the North. The fortress also housed several military barracks and military colleges for NCOs, including the Engineers Training Centre and the Armored Forces Officer Cadet School.

Modlin fortress was the place of the Battle of Modlin during the German invasion of Poland in 1939. General Wiktor Thommée ensconced the Army of Łódź in the fortress after failing to fight his way back to Warsaw, and his was one of the last Polish military units to capitulate.

== Present day ==

Some parts of the fortress are open to tourists. At the same time, the Polish military still has many facilities in the area and thus some redoubts are inaccessible. Some abandoned redoubts are not maintained and have deteriorated badly, with many metal elements having been pillaged for scrap. The Modlin airfield is located within the fortress area. It re-opened as the second civilian airport for the city of Warsaw in July 2012. In 2013 the Modlin Fortress was sold to private investors after being on the market for five years, but some key features such as the Tatar Tower and the White Tower must be preserved for the visiting public.

<text>Carré Brennan Otis (born September 28, 1968) is an American model and actress.

==Early life==
Carré Otis was born in San Francisco, and raised in Marin County, California, along with her older sister Chrisse and her younger brother Jordan. She attended Marin Academy in San Rafael, California, and the John Woolman School in Nevada City, California.

==Career==
===Early modeling===
Otis ran away from home at 16. A year later, while living with an abusive boyfriend in San Francisco, Otis was scouted, by Look Model Agency and was initially signed to Elite Model Management in New York by John Casablancas. She first achieved fame after being sent to Elite in Paris, when she appeared on the cover of French &quot;Elle&quot; in April 1986. Over the next several years, she appeared on covers in the American and foreign editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Mirabella&quot;, and &quot; Marie Claire&quot;. In 1991, Bruce Weber photographed Carré Otis, in San Francisco, California.

Otis appeared in ads for Guess jeans (1988), Calvin Klein jeans (1991), the 1996 Pirelli calendar, and also posed for the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; swimsuit edition (2000). Otis is the model on the poster above the character Rusty Griswald&#x27;s bed in the 1989 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;. Otis was also featured in 1990 and 2000 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Otis has walked the runway for Max Mara, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci, Ermanno Scervino, Todd Oldham and Donna Karan.

===Acting===
In 1989, Otis made her acting debut in the film &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; opposite future husband Mickey Rourke. Stills from the film&#x27;s climactic sex scene were sold to &quot;Playboy&quot;, and were the subject of a lawsuit filed by Otis. Otis would later appear in another Rourke film, &quot;Exit in Red&quot;.

===Later modeling===
After the end of her marriage to Rourke, Otis gradually resumed modeling. In 2000, she became one of the oldest models to appear in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; swimsuit issue, although Christie Brinkley at 34 and Cheryl Tiegs at 42 were featured prominently in the 25th Anniversary edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, released in 1989. Shortly thereafter, Otis began recovering from anorexia nervosa. As part of her recovery, she experienced a weight gain that offered her the opportunity to work as a plus-size model, most notably as the face for Marina Rinaldi and editorials for &quot;Mode&quot; Magazine; in 2003, Otis became a spokesperson for National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. She also appeared periodically as a correspondent on Channel 4 News in San Francisco.

In August 2003, Otis posed for a PETA ad campaign promoting vegetarianism and animal rights.

In 2005, she represented the Breil jewelry line.

She is on the advisory board of the Model Alliance and an ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association.

== Works ==
&quot;Beauty, Disrupted: A Memoir&quot; (2011) is an autobiographical book by Otis and Hugo Schwyzer.

Otis tells the story of her life and modelling career. She details abuses she suffered, including being raped &quot;countless&quot; times as a young girl by Gérald Marie,&lt;ref name=&quot;ageist/profile/carre-otis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the head of Elite Model Management″s Paris office. During her marriage to actor Mickey Rourke, she claims he was abusive, and even threatened to kill himself if she didn&#x27;t marry him.

==Personal life==
Otis developed three holes in her heart during her modeling career. Otis is a vegetarian.

From June 1992 to December 1998, Otis was married to &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; co-star Mickey Rourke. In 1994, Rourke was arrested for spousal abuse. The charges were later dropped.

In 2005, Otis married chemical engineer Matthew Sutton, they have two children.

<text>Warrington [[Dock (maritime)|Dock]] was situated on the River Mersey at Warrington.

Warrington was once the furthest point navigable upstream on the River Mersey. A dock evolved to allow unloading of goods for road transport to the east.

RMS Tayleur was built at Warrington in 1853, launched 4 October 1853 and sank on its maiden voyage to Australia.

A small Warrington Dock was also provided on the Manchester Ship Canal with a lock through to the River Mersey, but the dock and lock eventually became derelict. Plans for the area include some redevelopment for housing, and the creation of a linear park called &quot;Watersmeet&quot;, which follows the course of the cut through to the Mersey. The plan includes conservation of the structure of Walton Lock and the construction of a boom across the entrance to the dock, to prevent debris from the ship canal entering it. The basin will then be known as Waters Meet Basin, and will be developed as a wildlife haven. Navigation rights have not been expunged.

<text>The lumen (symbol: lm) is the unit of luminous flux, a measure of the perceived power of visible light emitted by a source, in the International System of Units (SI). Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux), which encompasses all electromagnetic waves emitted, including non-visible ones such as thermal radiation (infrared). By contrast, luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a &quot;luminosity function&quot;) of the human eye&#x27;s sensitivity to various wavelengths; this weighting is standardized by the CIE and ISO. 

The lumen is defined as equivalent to one candela-steradian (symbol cd·sr):
: 1 lm = 1 cd·sr.
A full sphere has a solid angle of 4π steradians (≈ 12.56637 sr), so an isotropic light source (that uniformly radiates in all directions) with a luminous intensity of one candela has a total luminous flux of 

One lux is one lumen per square metre.

==Explanation==
If a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity uniformly across a solid angle of one steradian, the total luminous flux emitted into that angle is one lumen (1 cd·1 sr = 1 lm).
Alternatively, an isotropic one-candela light-source emits a total luminous flux of exactly 4π lumens. If the source were partly covered by an ideal absorbing hemisphere, that system would radiate half as much luminous flux—only 2π lumens. The luminous intensity would still be one candela in those directions that are not obscured.

The lumen can be thought of casually as a measure of the total amount of visible light in some defined beam or angle, or emitted from some source. The number of candelas or lumens from a source also depends on its spectrum, via the nominal response of the human eye as represented in the luminosity function.

The difference between the units &quot;lumen&quot; and &quot;lux&quot; is that the lux takes into account the area over which the luminous flux is spread. A flux of 1,000 lumens, concentrated into an area of one square metre, lights up that square metre with an illuminance of 1,000 lux. The same 1,000 lumens, spread out over ten square metres, produces a dimmer illuminance of only 100 lux. In equation form, .

A source radiating a power of one watt of light in the color for which the eye is most efficient (a wavelength of 555 nm, in the green region of the optical spectrum) has luminous flux of 683 lumens. So a lumen represents at least 1/683 watts of visible light power, depending on the spectral distribution.

==Lighting==

Lamps used for lighting are commonly labelled with their light output in lumens; in many jurisdictions, this is required by law.

A 23 W spiral compact fluorescent lamp emits about 1,400–1,600 lm. Many compact fluorescent lamps and other alternative light sources are labelled as being equivalent to an incandescent bulb with a specific power. Below is a table that shows typical luminous flux for common incandescent bulbs and their equivalents.
The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt.

On 1 September 2010, European Union legislation came into force mandating that lighting equipment must be labelled &quot;primarily&quot; in terms of luminous flux (lm), instead of electric power (W). That change is a result of the EU&#x27;s Eco-design Directive for Energy-using Products (EuP). For example, according to the European Union standard, an energy-efficient bulb that claims to be the equivalent of a 60 W tungsten bulb must have a minimum light output of 700-810 lm.

==Projector output==

===ANSI lumens===
The light output of projectors (including video projectors) is typically measured in lumens. A standardized procedure for testing projectors has been established by the American National Standards Institute, which involves averaging together several measurements taken at different positions. For marketing purposes, the luminous flux of projectors that have been tested according to this procedure may be quoted in &quot;ANSI lumens&quot;, to distinguish them from those tested by other methods. ANSI lumen measurements are in general more accurate than the other measurement techniques used in the projector industry. This allows projectors to be more easily compared on the basis of their brightness specifications.

The method for measuring ANSI lumens is defined in the IT7.215 document which was created in 1992. First the projector is set up to display an image in a room at a temperature of . The brightness and contrast of the projector are adjusted so that on a full white field, it is possible to distinguish between a 5% screen area block of 95% peak white, and two identically sized 100% and 90% peak white boxes at the center of the white field. The light output is then measured on a full white field at nine specific locations around the screen and averaged. This average is then multiplied by the screen area to give the brightness of the projector in &quot;ANSI lumens&quot;.

===Peak lumens===
Peak lumens is a measure of light output normally used with CRT video projectors. The testing uses a test pattern typically at either 10 and 20 percent of the image area as white at the center of the screen, the rest as black. The light output is measured just in this center area. Limitations with CRT video projectors result in them producing greater brightness when just a fraction of the image content is at peak brightness. For example, the Sony VPH-G70Q CRT video projector produces 1200 &quot;peak&quot; lumens but just 200 ANSI lumens.

===Color light output===
Brightness (white light output) measures the total amount of light projected in lumens. The color brightness specification Color Light Output measures red, green, and blue each on a nine-point grid, using the same approach as that used to measure brightness.

<doc id="1163060" wikidata="Q7104067" url="?curid=1163060" title="Orrell, Greater Manchester">
<text>Orrell is a suburb of Wigan in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester, England. The population of the ward had fallen at the 2011 Census to 11,513. The area lies to the west of Wigan town centre. The area is contiguous with Pemberton.

Historically in Lancashire, Orrell was a centre of the coal mining industry, though today no evidence of the area&#x27;s industrial past is present. The electoral ward of Orrell has a population of 11,203, however, the ward covers a larger area also containing parts of Billinge and Winstanley.

==History==
Orrell derives from the Anglo Saxon &quot;ora&quot; and &quot;hyll&quot;, a hill where ore is dug. It has been variously recorded as Horul in 1212, Orel in 1292, Orhull in 1294 and Orul in 1307 and subsequently known as Orrell-in-Makerfield. It was the extreme north-west berewick of the manor of Newton-in-Makerfield before the Norman Conquest of England.

In 1212 the manor was held by Richard de Orrell but became divided and was acquired by the Hollands of Upholland and descended to the Lovels and subsequently to the Earls of Derby. After several changes of ownership it belonged to Roger Leigh of Aspull. Orrell was the family name of a number of landowners in the area and branches of the Orrell family held small estates here for centuries. There are records from 1558 showing William Orrell living at Orrell Hall.

===Industrial history===
The coal measures of the Lancashire Coalfield were mined extensively at the Orrell Collieries between 1740 and 1850. A tramroad modelled on John Blenkinsop&#x27;s railway at Middleton was built in 1812 from the pits to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Crooke. Robert Daglish was its engineer. A cottage nail making industry flourished at the same time. Another employer was the Sandbrook cotton mill where raw cotton was spun into thread. 
No significant industry is present in the area which is primarily a residential suburb for commuters.

===Post war===
Divided by the M6 and M58 motorways, the area has developed two unofficial &#x27;sections&#x27;: the southern section with railway station and Orrell Rugby Union Club&#x27;s former &#x27;Edge Hall Road; and Orrell Post, at the northern side of the M58. The original Orrell &#x27;post&#x27;, signifying a halt on the turnpike road, is still outside the Stag public house at a crossroads. The area&#x27;s proximity to Wigan town centre and its position at a junction of the M6, make it an attractive location from which to commute.

==Governance==
From 1894 to 1974, Orrell formed its own local government district; Orrell Urban District, and lay within the administrative county of Lancashire.

With the coming of local government reforms in 1974, Orrell&#x27;s urban district status was abolished and the area was amalgamated into the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, in Greater Manchester.

Orrell forms part of the Makerfield parliamentary constituency, which is represented in the House of Commons by Labour Member of Parliament, Yvonne Fovargue, replacing Ian McCartney who retired at the 2010 election.

==Geography==
The area&#x27;s northern section surrounds junction 26 of the M6 motorway. The M6 motorway passes north-south through the area and the section of Orrell to the east of the M6 directly adjoins the district of Pemberton. Orrell and Pemberton form one contiguous residential area.

Orrell is one of twenty five electoral wards that make up the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. It is the most westerly ward in Greater Manchester. Orrell is part of the Wigan Urban Area.

==Education==
St John Rigby College is situated at the northern edge of the Orrell area. St Peter&#x27;s Catholic High School consistently top of the Wigan schools&#x27; league table is located on the adjacent road to Orrell Library. Dean Trust Wigan is located on the eastern side of the M6 Motorway.

==Community facilities==
Orrell Library used to be located on Orrell Road but was closed in March 2010 and moved to the new nearby Abraham Guest High School, despite local attempts to keep the original site open. The former Orrell Library building on Orrell Road is now home to the local branch of &#x27;Book Cycle&#x27;, a volunteer-run community facility that allows users to exchange books for a small donation.

To the south of the area is Orrell Water Park, a disused water storage reservoir, which has now been turned to leisure use and attracts walkers, fishermen and picnickers.

The broadcasting studios of Wish FM, radio for the Wigan/St Helens area, were located in the area. on the eastern side of the M6. Wish FM discontinued its broadcast in 2020 when it merged with a number of other local stations to form Greatest Hits Radio North West. Its former studio building is now home to a training company, Expanse Learning.

==Transport==
The area&#x27;s principal road is the A577-Boothstown to Ormskirk. The M6 motorway runs north-south through the area. The easily accessible East Lancashire Road and M62 give access to Salford and Manchester. The M58 provides the Wigan area with a link to West Lancashire and the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton and the areas to the north the City of Liverpool. It was proposed that the Orrell area (Junction 26 of the M6) be the starting point of the A5225 Wigan and Hindley bypass road linking the M6 and the M58 with the M61 at Bolton. Orrell railway station is located at the southern section of the area providing services eastbound to Manchester Victoria (passing through Wigan Wallgate) and westbound to Kirkby (passing through Upholland railway station and Rainford railway station).

==Sport==
The area is the home of South Lancashire &amp; Cheshire Division 2 side Orrell Rugby Union Football Club. The senior and junior academy sides of Wigan RLFC rugby league club play their home games at Edge Hall Road. Orrell left Edge Hall Road at the end of the 2006–07 season and began playing at St John Rigby College.

The Orrell Otters Football Club currently ply their trade in the South Lancs Counties Second Division after winning the Third Division championship in their debut season, and are also the current Houghton Memorial Cup holders after winning the trophy in 2010.

<doc id="1163075" wikidata="Q6746573" url="?curid=1163075" title="Manabu Namiki">
<text>is a Japanese video game composer who is primarily known for his work in shoot &#x27;em up games. He has worked at game companies such as Allumer, NMK, Raizing and M2. In October 2002, Namiki, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Masaharu Iwata founded the music production company Basiscape, whom he worked with until 2011. 

==Early life==
Namiki became interested in arcade games during his childhood. He never received any musical education, nor learned to play any instruments. He became enthusiastic about music from video games, as well as hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Whitesnake and Metallica. After buying an MSX2, he learnt how to program music in BASIC and attempted to imitate the riffs of the bands he enjoyed. He also joined a video game music cover band in 1989.

==Allumer, NMK and Raizing (1990–2000)==
In 1990, he joined Allumer as a part-time graphic designer while at college, despite having very little design experience. He assisted with graphics for its 1991 shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Rezon&quot;. His enthusiasm for the job decreased, and was fired as a result of not finishing sound programming work his boss had assigned to him. The following year, he left college and joined NMK as a full-time sound creator. He worked on several titles such as &quot;Thunder Dragon 2&quot; and &quot;Bomb Jack Twin&quot;, as well as &quot;Zed Blade&quot;, which features hardcore techno music as a response to the trend of techno music in video games. His final work at the company was &quot;Desert War&quot;; by the time the game was released in 1995, he had already left NMK to join Raizing.

One of the first games he composed for at Raizing was &quot;Battle Garegga&quot;, often considered to be his breakthrough work. The soundtrack takes heavy inspiration from Detroit techno music, the soundtrack of &quot;Recca&quot;, and the music of Hitoshi Sakimoto and Shinji Hosoe. As the system featured outdated sound hardware, he aspired to make the most of its abilities. The Sega Saturn version of &quot;Battle Garegga&quot; features an arranged soundtrack, with arrangements from himself, Sakimoto, Hosoe, and other friends. He also contributed music to the original arcade versions of the fighting game &quot;Bloody Roar&quot; and its sequel. 

==Freelance work and Basiscape (2000–2012)==
In early 2000, Namiki left Raizing and became freelance while searching for a new job. He struggled to find a job, while some game projects he had taken on were cancelled. His first major projects as a freelancer were Cave&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up games &quot;DoDonPachi DaiOuJou&quot; and &quot;&quot;, released in 2002 and 2003 respectively. He found the projects challenging; the music in both games had to be composed in the MOD format using 8 channels. In October 2002, he co-founded the music production company Basiscape with Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, both of whom he had previously worked with on projects at Raizing, although he worked as a contractor in a freelance capacity and not as a full-time employee.

One of his first major projects at Basiscape was &quot;Mushihimesama&quot;, which features lighter music than previous shoot &#x27;em up games he had composed for, taking influences from a wide range of genres; Iwata also contributed several tracks to the game, which he feels widened the variety of music in the game. During his time working with Basiscape, he also contributed music to several games related to anime franchises, such as &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Dream Carnival&quot;, the &quot;&quot; series, and &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;, as well as role-playing games such as &quot;Fantasy Earth Zero&quot;, &quot;Odin Sphere&quot;, and &quot;Opoona&quot;. He also served as the sole composer of the action role-playing game &quot;Black Rock Shooter: The Game&quot; in 2011.

Namiki&#x27;s work with Cave continued throughout his time at Basiscape. Although he was initially asked to compose the music for &quot;Espgaluda&quot;, he could not fit the job into his schedule, although he composed for its sequel, &quot;Espgaluda II&quot;, which similarly features trance music. He composed for &quot;Deathsmiles&quot; in 2007, which features gothic rock music; it features guitar performances by Noriyuki Kamikura, a composer who worked at Basiscape at the time. He also composed for &quot;DoDonPachi Resurrection&quot; with then-new Basiscape members Azusa Chiba and Yoshimi Kudo, as well as its &quot;Black Label&quot; version in 2010 alongside Chiba, Kudo and Kamikura. He found it difficult to communicate with his juniors due to the large generational gap and having different musical influences.

==M2 and later freelance work (2012–present)==
In 2012, he joined M2 as a sound director, whom he had already closely worked with for a decade. One of his first projects at the company was composing the soundtrack for G.rev&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Kokuga&quot;; its sound has been described as more melodic and less atmospheric than his previous shoot &#x27;em up scores. While employed at M2, Namiki also worked on several titles in the &quot;Sega 3D Reprint Archives&quot; series; &quot;3D OutRun&quot; notably features two new tracks composed by him and M2 colleague Jane-Evelyn Nisperos respectively. 

Namiki left M2 in 2017, but continues to maintain a close relationship with the company. He designed and composed music for the Game Gear shoot &#x27;em up &quot;GG Aleste 3&quot;, which released in 2020 as part of &quot;Aleste Collection&quot;. He has also worked with exA-Arcadia, providing arranged music for titles such as &quot;Gimmick! Exact Mix&quot; and &quot;P-47 Aces Mk.II&quot;.

<text>Widnes Dock was the first rail-to-ship facility in the world. It was built in 1833 between the end of the Sankey Canal and the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway in Widnes. 

==History==

The remains of the dock are to be found on Spike Island. The island was at the centre of the chemical industry in the 19th century and became heavily polluted. In operation the dock was topped up by its own adjacent reservoir. The dock closed in the 1930s and it along with its lock and reservoir were filled in.

Between 1975 and 1982 the island was cleaned up. During this time part of the original dock was dug out to a depth of around 3 feet. The dock is now used for recreational purposes and fishing.

In 1864 the nearby West Bank Dock was opened and took traffic away from Widnes Dock. The West Bank Dock closed in the 1970s and was itself redeveloped into the current dock, the Mersey Multimodal Gateway.

<doc id="1163083" wikidata="Q3635187" url="?curid=1163083" title="Gaṅgeśa">
<text>Gaṅgeśa (, &quot;Gaṅgeśa Upādhyāya&quot;) (first half of the 14th century) was an Indian philosopher, logician and mathematician from the kingdom of Mithila. He established the Navya-Nyāya (&quot;New Logic&quot;) school. His &quot;Tattvachintāmaṇi&quot; (The Jewel of Thought on the Nature of Things), also known as &quot;Pramāṇacintāmaṇi&quot; (The Jewel of Thought on the Means of Valid Knowledge), is the basic text for all later developments. The logicians of this school were primarily interested in defining their terms and concepts related to non-binary logical categories.

==Life==
Gaṅgeśa was a native of the Mithila region in modern-day Bihar. He seems to have been born and raised in a village called Chadana however this is no longer identifiable. He later lived in the village of Karion, the same village that fellow philosopher, Udayana came from which is twelve miles southeast of the city of Darbhanga.

Scholars have struggled to find an accurate date for Gaṅgeśa with the most common estimate placing him in the late thirteenth century however recent opinion now places him in the fourteenth century.

==Teachings==
Gaṅgeśa&#x27;s work is mainly focused on epistemology although he does rely on ontological systems in his analyses. He inherits his thoughts from his predecessor, Udayana which he incorporates into his Navya-Nyāya system. In his exploration of causal relationships, Gaṅgeśa identifies several categories of possible referents that play a role in understanding causality. These categories are grounded in the relationships between causes and effects, and they include:

Inherence (Samavāya): This refers to the inseparable relationship between a substance and its qualities or actions. For instance, the color of a pot is inherently related to the pot itself.
Non-inherence (Asamavāya): This category involves relationships that are not direct but still play a crucial role in causal connections, such as the color of threads contributing to the color of the cloth.
Non-existence (Abhāva): Gaṅgeśa also discusses the concept of non-existence as a possible referent in causal relations. Non-existence can refer to the absence of a cause or an effect, which plays a crucial role in understanding why certain effects do not occur.
===Perception===
Gaṅgeśa provides a detailed account of perception (pratyakṣa) as a fundamental means of knowledge acquisition. He categorizes perception into two types:

Sensory Perception: This type refers to the direct contact between sense organs and external objects, leading to knowledge. Gaṅgeśa&#x27;s analysis of perception involves understanding how the senses apprehend various qualities of objects, such as color or sound.
Extraordinary Perception (Alaukika Pratyakṣa): While the article touches on Gaṅgeśa&#x27;s understanding of perception primarily in a sensory context, he also discusses the possibility of extraordinary perception, which occurs in situations that go beyond ordinary sensory experiences.

===Inference===
Inference (anumāna) is another critical method of knowledge in Gaṅgeśa&#x27;s philosophy. Gaṅgeśa defines inference as a process that allows one to draw conclusions based on observed relationships. He distinguishes between two types of inference:

Inference for Oneself (Svārthānumāna): This type of inference is used by an individual to arrive at knowledge independently, based on their own observations and reasoning.
Inference for Others (Parārthānumāna): This type of inference is presented in a way that can be communicated to others, providing a logical basis for convincing others of a particular conclusion.
Gaṅgeśa&#x27;s analysis of inference includes an examination of the conditions under which inferences are valid, focusing on the relationship between the observed evidence and the conclusion drawn from it.

===The &quot;Tattvacintāmaṇi&quot;===
The founding text of Navya-Nyaya - is divided into four khaṇḍas (books): Pratyakṣakhaṇḍa (book on perception), Anumānakhaṇḍa (book on inference), Upamānakhaṇḍa (book on comparison) and Śabdakhaṇḍa (book on verbal testimony). The first book opens with a salutation to Shiva.

The Tattvacintāmaṇi (T.C.) is a systematic account of epistemology, logic, and the philosophy of grammar. Other subjects, such as the proofs of God, are treated incidentally.

Gangesa refers to his own teachings as the New Nyaya. This term New Nyaya is not to be understood as implying any great originality in theory on Gangesa&#x27;s part, but rather originality in method. His work differs from the oldest Nyaya in that he accepts many tenets of the Vaisesika school, and in his arrangement of Nyaya teachings under four headings rather than under the 16 subjects (padartha) of the Old Nyaya.

The newness of Gangesa&#x27;s method is newness of style and of organization. He is far more precise, more careful to define his terms, than were his predecessors; these virtues of his work are responsible for the fact that perhaps half of Navya-Nyaya literature is based either directly on the T.C. or on a commentary on the T.C.

<text>Summer Roberts is a fictional character on the FOX television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, portrayed by Rachel Bilson.

==Production history==
Summer was originally intended as a small supporting character, only there as an object of fantasy for Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) and a friend for Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), while Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) and Marissa were the lead couple. However, due to Bilson&#x27;s performance, Summer became an increasingly important character. Series creator Josh Schwartz said: &quot;She was adorable, funny and smart, which was a really fresh way to go with that character. And the more we gave her to do in the first couple of episodes, the more she kept nailing. Finally, in the episode with the Tijuana road trip, we watched a scene between her and Seth in the diner and knew: This girl is amazing. Let&#x27;s make her a series regular.&quot;

==Character==
Summer Roberts grew up in Newport Beach, California, with her wealthy father, Dr. Neil Roberts (Michael Nouri). For much of the series, she also lived with a stepmother, named Gloria (unseen character), whom she never refers to by name, instead calling the latter &quot;what&#x27;s her name&quot; or &quot;the stepmonster&quot; due to her mood swings and various addictive pills. She was often paired in scenes with her best friend, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), who was the leading female of the series until her death. Summer became the female lead character of the show&#x27;s fourth season. During this all, she had a long lasting relationship with Seth Cohen. In a flash forward in the series finale, &quot;The End&#x27;s Not Near, It&#x27;s Here&quot;, she marries Seth. Her character was only scheduled to appear in a few episodes, but was considered a hit, and ended up being in each of the series. 
Spoiled by her divorced father, Summer considers him to be her best friend, and his opinion matters as much, if not more than her own. 
Summer was unusual in combining the qualities of a conventionally attractive and desirable character with a tough, outspoken, &quot;take-charge&quot; attitude. She is portrayed as highly sexualised and initially appears unintelligent; however it is revealed that she has maintained strong academic performance throughout high school when she is accepted into Brown University, where she nurtures a passion for environmental activism.

In season 4 Summer adopts a pet rabbit and names her Pancakes. It is revealed in the season finale that Pancakes had been pregnant, after Seth and Summer discover Pancakes&#x27; babies living under her bed. Ryan adopted one of the bunnies, naming it Flapjacks.

==Storyline==

===Season 1===
In the first season, Summer is introduced as a high schooler who looks down on people from middle and working class backgrounds. Her elitism is on display in the first episode, where she is at first attracted to newcomer Ryan Atwooduntil she learns he is from Chino, prompting her response, &quot;Chino, ew.&quot; Her attraction to him continues afterwards. However, different sides to her character have been shown as she has developed. Before choosing Summer (after her finally showing her feelings for Seth) Seth picks Anna Stern (Samaire Armstrong), who exhibits a similarly strong personality and shares his sarcastic sense of humor and love of comic books, the first go around. For the few episodes, they have a &quot;will they or won&#x27;t they&quot; type of relationship, but they eventually begin dating and fall in love. In the process of their characters&#x27; relationship, Summer and Seth experience many struggles because Summer thinks it will affect her popularity at their high school.

As the season progresses, Summer is affected by their relationship and is often jealous of Seth, since he seems to be enjoying Anna&#x27;s company so much. As a result, Summer gets angry and starts dating a classmate named Danny (Bret Harrison), but that relationship doesn&#x27;t last long, and she finds that she still has feelings for Seth. Midway through the end of the first season, Anna breaks up with Seth because it is obvious he is still in love with Summer. Seth and Summer become a couple, and announce their romance at a school kissing booth, after which they become very close. Summer and Seth lose their virginity to each other. When Ryan moves away, however, Seth, missing his adopted brother, moves away as well at the end of the season, leaving behind a heartbroken Summer.

===Season 2===
Summer has a new boyfriend, Zach Stevens (Michael Cassidy). Zach is starting to become friends with Seth, whom he met shortly before Zach and Summer started dating, yet their friendship is a little mixed since they both have feelings for Summer. Summer seems committed to putting Seth behind her, although at times it becomes clear that she still has feelings for him. This inevitably causes problems for her relationship with Zach, who suspected they still held feelings for each other. This is further complicated when Summer also becomes professionally involved with Seth and Zach as they develop their comic book, &quot;Atomic County&quot;, for publication. This relationship proves inextricably linked with the personal feelings all have for each other, and resulted in a bad meeting with a media executive that effectively killed their partnership.

Summer was about to go on an overseas trip to Italy with Zach and his family, when the feelings she still had for Seth prevented her from doing so and she left her heartbroken Zach at the airport, going back to Seth. Zach returned later on in the season however, and this along with Zach and Seth once again going into a partnership for a comic book strained her relationship with Seth. Zach also somewhat subtly exploited this to weaken Seth and Summer&#x27;s relationship and restart his relationship with her, causing something of a love triangle. The introduction of Reed, a female attractive, older comic book executive who Seth was not initially truthful about also caused difficulties. This was eventually resolved when on the day of the Junior Prom they flipped a coin as to who would go to the prom with Summer and who would meet George Lucas for a comic book project meeting, with Zach winning the date with Summer. 
However at the Prom both Summer and Zach seemed unhappy with their choices, and at the last minute Seth arrived at the prom to receive the Prom Queen/King award with Summer and reconciled their relationship. Zach apparently succeeded in impressing Lucas and it has been rumored he was given an internship and moved away from Newport as a result, explaining his absence for season 3.

Towards the end of the season Summer also becomes worried about her best friend Marissa&#x27;s behaviour, unexplained bruises and a tension with her boyfriend Ryan and his brother Trey. She confronts Marissa and Marissa confesses that Trey had attempted to rape her. Summer consults Seth about this, who feels obliged to tell Ryan and as a result the tragic events of Trey&#x27;s shooting happen, with Seth and Summer arriving at the aftermath of the shooting.

===Season 3===
Summer is adjusting to her senior year at Harbor School, with the year starting with her best friend Marissa Cooper expelled from Harbor as a result of her involvement in the shooting of Trey Atwood (Logan Marshall-Green). As a result, Summer reluctantly seeks a more involved role in student politics, gaining a new rival in fellow student Taylor Townsend (Autumn Reeser). They have since become friends, particularly when Taylor helped her get Marissa back in by organizing a petition. Summer is initially insecure about her relationship with Seth, because she often felt that he was smarter than her and she feared that he would break up with her for someone more like him. However, when Summer gets a very high SAT score, it gives her the ambition to change, and she begins to focus on school.

Also, her relationship with Seth is closer than it was during much of the previous year, and the couple&#x27;s post-graduation future is one that she finds harder to ignore. They have trouble earlier in the season deciding what colleges to go to and how it would affect their future together, but eventually they agree on going to Brown University, which is more feasible after Summer gets a high SAT score. Summer cares a lot about Seth and when he starts smoking pot, she becomes worried about him and forgives him if he promises to stop. When Summer finds out that Seth is still smoking pot, she is upset, but Seth apologizes with a letter on a napkin, admitting his lies and mistakes, and tells Summer that if he messes up again, she can show it to his parents. Summer forgives Seth. Shortly before they get their college acceptance letters, Summer says that if should she get into Brown and not Seth, she will not go. When they get their letters, to Seth&#x27;s dismay this happens. Seth, not wanting to be responsible for Summer turning down a major educational and life opportunity, says he does not want to go to Brown anymore. As a result, they break up, with Seth stating when confronted by Summer that he does not love her anymore. While their future as a couple seems uncertain at this point (and is complicated by the return of Seth&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Anna Stern), Summer takes a Korean pop star as date for the prom. Upon seeing Seth with Anna, Summer feels hurt. When Summer falls off the stage after being announced Prom Queen for the second time in a row, Seth runs to her and tells her the truth about Brown and they reconcile. They have resigned themselves to going to school in Rhode Island, albeit at different schools.

Summer has also dealt with several changes in her home life, such as her stepmother, an unseen character, leaving and divorcing her father. Also more recently she has had to deal with her father dating her best friend&#x27;s mother, Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke). She eventually accepted the relationship and recently announced engagement, however, seeing the happiness it had brought her father despite her own reservations about Julie.

===Season 4===
Summer is adjusting to life in college without Seth and Marissa in an unexpected fashion. She tries to separate herself from Orange County and her former materialistic lifestyle. During the final season, she and Taylor go from being rivals to best friends.

Whilst attending college she befriends another college freshman, Che (Chris Pratt), an environmentalist, and Summer becomes one as well in an attempt to take her mind off Marissa&#x27;s recent death. She attends protests, stops shaving her legs and rearranges her dorm to fit her new lifestyle. After some time, she tries to return to her old lifestyle, but realizes that she prefers having a purpose in life to her former comfortable, but shallow, existence. She decides to find a balance between the two extremes, but her environmental activism occasionally creates trouble for her, such as when she and Che release lab rabbits from a science lab. When Brown officials investigate the incident, she remains truthful aside for not naming her accomplice. Unfortunately, Che puts the blame on her, which results in her year-long expulsion. Summer moves back into her old Newport house with the Coopers and Taylor. Upon hearing of her expulsion, Seth decides to put off college until the following fall so they could return to Providence together. Close to New Year&#x27;s Eve, Summer has a pregnancy scare, and Seth proposes to her. Although Summer finds out she is not pregnant after all, she and Seth decide to move ahead with their engagement.
In &quot;The French Connection&quot;, Summer meets up with former best friend Holly Fischer (Ashley Hartman) to find out what life is like as a &quot;Newpsie-wed&quot;. Summer realizes that she has changed and no longer belongs in her old world; she fears that she does not know who she truly is, and breaks off the engagement with Seth in order to find herself. She slowly works toward this as she and Seth re-connect.

Later, Summer helps rescue a groundhog in a political protest in which Seth and Che are arrested. Also, in &quot;The Case of the Franks&quot; Summer gets offered a job at GEORGE (Global Environmental Organisation Regarding Greenhouse Emissions) travelling around the country speaking to children in high school. She believes that this is one part of her destiny, while Seth is the other.

She challenges Seth to make stock film after he criticizes the films at GEORGE&#x27;s art show. As a joke, he films an inflatable orca and shark in his backyard swimming pool for six hours. Summer is not amused, however, and says that he should stop being lazy and actually do something with his life. During his second attempt, which consists of various adventures of the family, he overhears a conversation between Summer and Kirsten, in which the former says that she just wants Seth to be excited about something that he loves. During a trip to rent &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, an earthquake hits Newport. Summer and Seth safely get out of Ryan&#x27;s Jeep when a light pole falls onto it.

====Series finale====
Six months later, Seth and Summer fall into a rut after the earthquake, and spend hours watching &quot;Briefcase or No Briefcase&quot; (a television game show take-off of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;). Seth tells her that she must join GEORGE, and they will always be together. Summer leaves Seth to help the environment and they say farewell. Summer attends protests and works to save the environment and educate students on environmental issues for a year. She appears in newspaper articles as an environmentalist. In a flash-forward sequence, Summer ends up marrying Seth.

<text>James Louis de Zogheb Dreyfus (born 9 October 1968) is an English actor most notable for roles on television sitcoms &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; as Constable Kevin Goody, and &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot; as Tom Farrell. Dreyfus is most recently known for a role as Reverend Roger Jones in &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;.

In London&#x27;s West End, Dreyfus starred in &quot;The Producers&quot; in 2004 as Carmen Ghia. In 2006, he starred as the Emcee in &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

== Early life ==
James Louis de Zogheb Dreyfus was born on 9 October 1968 in Islington, London. His parents divorced when he was very young. His mother, Margo de Zoghels, was a model. She and his maternal grandparents were from Egypt.

He was educated at Harrow School. He then trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

== Career ==

At the 1998 Laurence Olivier Awards, Dreyfus won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical for his work in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; at the National Theatre. In the same year, Dreyfus won Second Prize at the Ian Charleson Awards for his 1997 performance as Caius Cassius in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Birmingham Rep.

Dreyfus&#x27;s first television break came with the BBC comedy series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. followed by roles as Constable Kevin Goody in Ben Elton&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; and Tom Farrell, the gay flatmate of Linda Hughes (Kathy Burke) in &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;. Dreyfus played opposite Bette Midler in the short-lived American sitcom &quot;Bette&quot;.

Known for portraying &quot;camp, endearing characters,&quot; Dreyfus (in a &quot;Sheengate Publishing&quot; interview) compared the character Frank Spencer from &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, whom he described as a campy but married heterosexual, to Dreyfus&#x27;s character Kevin Goody from &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;. Regarding his character Tom Farrell from &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, Dreyfus hypothesized that, even if the character were heterosexual, the actor would still portray Tom as camp and flamboyant. Furthermore, Dreyfus said that he felt that he became typecast due to his portrayals of &quot;flamboyant&quot; characters.

He played Thermoman in the BBC One comedy &quot;My Hero&quot;, a role he took over in the sixth series from Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon. Although the same character, he used the name George Monday, as opposed to O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s character&#x27;s name, George Sunday. After disappointing ratings, the show was cancelled.

Dreyfus also starred as Mr Teasy-Weasy in the 2004 comedy film &quot;&quot;.

From 2012 to 2017, Dreyfus appeared as Reverend Roger Jones in the Sky Living series &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;.

In 2017, he voiced an incarnation of The Master from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the Big Finish Productions release &quot;The First Doctor Adventures Volume One&quot;, going on to appear as the character in 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Home Guard&quot;, 2020&#x27;s &quot;The Psychic Circus&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;Blood of the Time Lords&quot;. In an interview on SpectatorTV, Dreyfus said he was dismissed from the role following comments he made on Twitter in support of author J. K. Rowling.

<text>West Bank Dock was situated on the River Mersey at Widnes.

It was built in 1864 to cater for the growing chemical industry.

It took over some of the traffic of the Widnes Dock.

The dock closed in the 1970s.

In 2008, the Stobart Group had received a contract for &quot;the demolition of an unused industrial estate and the cleanup of acres of contaminated land at the West Bank Dock Estate in Widnes.&quot; from the Northwest Regional Development Agency. The new Mersey Multimodal Gateway will be built on the old West Bank Dock Estate.

<doc id="1163092" wikidata="Q5592982" url="?curid=1163092" title="Graham Kerr">
<text>Graham Kerr (born 22 January 1934) is an English cooking personality who is best known for his television cooking show &quot;The Galloping Gourmet,&quot; which aired from 30 December 1968 to 14 September 1972.

==Early life==
Kerr was born in Brondesbury, London. His Scottish parents,
Major John Douglas Kerr and his wife were hoteliers at 
Dorset Arms Pub and Inn in East Grinstead West Sussex, England, then, at Alexandra Hotel, 32, 33 &amp; 34 Eversfield Place, St Leonards-on-Sea, Borough of Hastings, East Sussex, England. As a result, much of his childhood was spent among European chefs.

On the pronunciation of his family name, Kerr wrote in &quot;The Graham Kerr Cookbook&quot; that &quot;my name is pronounced ‘care’ — not ‘cur’ , as in the case of Bill Kerr and not ‘car’ , as in the case of Deborah Kerr,&quot; respectively. 

As a youth, he attended Michael Hall School, a Waldorf school at Kidbrooke Park in Forest Row, East Sussex. In 1945, Kerr met Treena Van Doorne, later, his wife, at Michael Hall School
Although he dropped out of school at age 14 and began training in kitchens, he returned years later and attended the independent school Brighton Technical College and South Devon College in Devon.

==Career==
===Early career===
Kerr became trainee manager at the Roebuck Hotel in Forest Row, East Sussex, England, when he was 15 years old. After five years in the British Army, rising to catering adviser, he became general manager of the Royal Ascot Hotel.

===New Zealand and &quot;Entertaining with Kerr&quot;===
Kerr moved to New Zealand in 1958, becoming chief catering adviser for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

He moved into television in New Zealand when being recruited by TVNZ producer Shirley Maddock. In 1959, he began hosting the television show &quot;Entertaining with Kerr&quot;, in which he appeared dressed in military uniform. His recipes were also delivered on radio and in magazines, and the first edition of a related book, &quot;Entertaining with Kerr&quot;, was sold out in eight days. During these early years Kerr won a Penguin Award as &quot;Personality of the Year.&quot;

===Australia===
Shortly after the TVNZ series was launched, promoter Anthony Hollows introduced Kerr to his business partner, rising New Zealand entertainment promoter and artist manager Harry M. Miller. Miller was at first sceptical of taking Kerr on, having just lost heavily on a disastrous promotion of a folk music concert, but Hollows was insistent, and after seeing Kerr in action, Miller immediately saw his potential. Miller (who was well established across the Tasman Sea as a concert promoter) was confident that he could launch Kerr in Australia. Kerr signed on as Miller&#x27;s first management client, and the relationship proved enormously important and financially rewarding to both men. Miller was instrumental in launching Kerr in Australia, and Kerr&#x27;s breakthrough in turn laid the foundation for Miller&#x27;s own success as a leading player in the Australian and New Zealand entertainment industry over the next 20 years.

In 1964 Kerr moved to Sydney, and through his Australian contacts, Miller was soon able to sign Kerr to present a regular cooking show on Channel 10, also called &quot;Entertaining with Kerr&quot;, as part of the TEN Network, Australia&#x27;s recently established third commercial television outlet. Although Kerr&#x27;s initial fee was modest, Miller wisely balanced that against the value of the exposure, certain that Kerr would make an impact. The show quickly became a huge national success, leading to daily radio spots, newspaper and magazine columns, personal appearances, and lucrative product endorsements. Miller also cited winemaker and critic Len Evans as being especially helpful to Kerr in these early days. Miller soon scored another coup when he signed the multinational food company Nestlé as Kerr&#x27;s first major sponsor.

At some point, Kerr&#x27;s television ratings took a dive, and the series was cancelled. However, his radio show continued. On the recommendation of the wife of a board member, who listened to Kerr&#x27;s radio show, the Australian Dairy Board signed Kerr to what Miller described as an endorsement contract &quot;of staggering proportions,&quot; and Kerr was soon back on national television.

In his autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, Miller recounted that &quot;the sweetest contract I offered Graham was one he refused to sign.&quot; In the mid-1960s Union Carbide, the manufacturers of Glad Wrap, approached Miller with a lucrative offer for Kerr to become its national endorser. All Kerr had to do was make a few commercials, pose for a few photos, and use the product on his cooking show. Sensing the huge potential of the new product, Miller cannily negotiated for a multiyear contract in which Kerr was to receive a royalty of about 0.5c on every unit sold instead of a flat fee. To Miller&#x27;s astonishment, however, Kerr was unimpressed by Glad Wrap, and despite Miller&#x27;s strenuous effort to demonstrate its enormous usefulness, Kerr remained unconvinced.

===Canada and &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot;===
Miller and Kerr parted ways in the late-1960s after Kerr received a lucrative offer from Fremantle of Canada. Although his management contract with Miller still had several years to run, Kerr and Miller agreed to a negotiated buy-out; the two parted ways amicably, and remained good friends.

Kerr&#x27;s new series for Fremantle of Canada, &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; (30 December 1968–September 14, 1972) was named for his onscreen persona. It was recorded in Ottawa at CJOH-TV and produced by his wife Treena Kerr. The origin of his Galloping Gourmet persona stemmed from &quot;The Galloping Gourmets&quot;, a 1967 book he co-authored with wine expert Len Evans. The nickname was the result of a 35-day worldwide trek to the finest restaurants around the globe. The show was taped in front of a live audience. The title was echoed in the opening of each episode, where Kerr entered the stage area by running in and leaping over a chair in the dining room set (a stunt conceived by Treena). Many episodes featured a prerecorded segment with Kerr in a part of the world wherein that episode&#x27;s dish originated.

The series was known for its lighthearted humour, tomfoolery, and the copious use of clarified butter, cream, and fat. A famous line of Kerr&#x27;s on the show was his response to someone&#x27;s criticism of his cooking: &quot;Madam, you could go outside and get run over by a bus, and just think what you would have missed!&quot; He also liberally featured wine, serving it with most meals, using it in his dishes, and waxing poetic about its virtues. He would also raise a glass of wine to his lips (which he referred to as a &quot;Short Slurp&quot;) as a cue to the director to cut to commercials, then would bring it back up to his lips right before the show came back on. This gave the impression to some viewers that he was drinking heavily during the taping. In reality, he drank very little.

In an ongoing feature of the show, Kerr would make his way into the audience as the closing credits began and select an audience member (usually female) whom he would invite onstage with him to enjoy whatever dish he had just prepared. Another recurring feature at the end of each show would be a close-up of Kerr as he sampled the dish he had just cooked. To &quot;oohs and ahs&quot; from the audience, he would pull a face as though he was in ecstasy from tasting his latest creation.

&quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; was a hit, and earned two Emmy Award nominations. During its run, Kerr became a worldwide sensation and wrote an abundance of cookbooks. However, he was pilloried by many of the elite of the food world of the time, including influential food writer Michael Field, who called Kerr &quot;the Liberace of the food world,&quot; and James Beard, who wrote that Kerr &quot;has very little respect for food.&quot;

The show was dubbed in French and aired on Télévision de Radio-Canada starting 6 September 1971, under the title &quot;Le Gourmet farfelu&quot;.

From 1969 to 1972 Kerr also made guest appearances on &quot;Monitor&quot;, a long-running NBC radio variety programme.

===Personal setbacks, born-again Christianity and &quot;Take Kerr&quot;===
Some near-tragedies caused Kerr to suspend his television career, thus ending the show. In April 1971, Kerr and his wife Treena were involved in a car crash in California. As a result of the accident, he suffered a dislocated spine and a weakened left arm. As therapy, Kerr wore a bracelet to strengthen the weakened arm. In January 1972, Treena was at first diagnosed with lung cancer. That diagnosis turned out to be incorrect; it was later determined she had tuberculosis. Although a part of a lung was removed, she made a full recovery. However, she became addicted to painkillers as well as several other medications.

In 1975, Treena became a born-again Christian after being encouraged by an employee; Kerr also became religious at the same time.

Kerr returned to television in 1975 with a daily syndicated five-minute series, &quot;Take Kerr&quot;, which featured a particular recipe for each show. This programme reflected his newfound embrace of both Christianity and healthful eating, with lighter-calorie recipes and Christian elements, including the use of the hymn &quot;This Is the Day the Lord Has Made&quot; as a theme song. The programme lasted four series. One Christian element on the show, an inclusion of a passage from the Bible in the closing credits, was strongly resisted by one of the stations on which the show aired, and indirectly caused Kerr to lose millions of dollars in potential revenue owing to his unwillingness to compromise. This series was later repeated on CNN during its first year or two.

In a 1975 interview publicising &quot;Take Kerr&quot;, Kerr renounced the show &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot;, saying that &quot;What I did wasn&#x27;t art, it was a crime,&quot; given the increasing rate of obesity in the United States. He also apologised for two of his trademarks on that show, his wine drinking and his double entendres. He stated that he was trying to convince TV stations to remove reruns of the show from syndication.

===Minimax, &quot;The Graham Kerr Show&quot;, and &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;===
After his wife Treena&#x27;s stroke, then heart attack in 1986, Kerr was prompted to create a new style of cooking that he dubbed &quot;Minimax.&quot; This new method of food preparation minimised (&quot;Mini-&quot;) fat and cholesterol while it maximised (&quot;-max&quot;) aroma, colour, texture, and taste. Minimax led to &quot;The Graham Kerr Show&quot;, originally produced at KING-TV in Seattle and later syndicated to local stations during the 1990–91 season, followed by a run on the Discovery Channel. From 1992 to 1995, Kerr starred on the PBS show &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, which again embraced the low-fat, &quot;minimax&quot; approach.

Minimax also led to three successful cookbooks: &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Smart Cooking&quot;, &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Minimax Cookbook&quot;, and &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Creative Choices (A Minimax Book)&quot; along with corresponding series on public television: &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Graham Kerr&#x27;s Swiftly Seasoned&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Graham Kerr&quot;.

&quot;Graham Kerr&quot; was distributed by MTM Enterprises.

===Career since 1995===
In 1995, he appeared in &quot;Cooking in Concert: Julia Child &amp; Graham Kerr&quot;, a PBS TV special with Julia Child. 

In 1996, Kerr, in his book of that year called &quot;Swiftly Seasoned&quot;, created the concept of a &quot;Moulded Ethnic Vegetable,&quot; a baked combination of starches and vegetables seasoned with flavours characteristic of different ethnic cuisines. The &quot;MEV,&quot; as he referred to it in recipes, was intended to remedy what he perceived as a lack of focus in vegetarian meals; according to Kerr, while omnivorous cuisine generally has a central focus in a meat dish, vegetarian plates are often little more than collections of side dishes, and the MEV was an attempt to provide a central focus for such meals. The MEV was not a widely successful concept, and a business venture to manufacture and sell a muffin tin–like MEV baking pan was not successful. (While it was generally intended to be vegetarian, Kerr did incorporate meats into some MEV recipes in later books.)

From 1996 to 2000, Kerr was also the editor-at-large for &quot;Cooking Light&quot; magazine.

Since the late 1990s, Graham Kerr appeared in a series of radio and television features for the &quot;5 A Day&quot; programme of the National Cancer Institute, called &quot;Do Yourself a Flavor&quot;, emphasising the use of fruits and vegetables in recipes. Kerr&#x27;s earlier series, including &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot;, has aired in the U.S. on Food Network and Cooking Channel. He has worked with Bastyr University and many businesses looking for innovation, better health and good taste.

In 1997–98, Kerr recorded a series &quot;The Gathering Place&quot; in Toronto. A total of 130 one-hour episodes were recorded. The series featured guests who were prominent authorities in various health fields. Kerr included videos shot on location on a worldwide voyage aboard the ship &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (&quot;QE2&quot;).

Kerr&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Flash of Silver...the leap that changed my world&quot; was published in 2015.

==Awards and accolades==
In 1965, Kerr was awarded the gold medal at the Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt, Germany, for &quot;The Graham Kerr Cookbook by the Galloping Gourmet&quot;.

In 2003, he received an honorary doctorate for culinary arts and nutrition from Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. Also in 2003, Kerr was awarded an Honorary Life Member of the American Dietetic Association.

==Influence==
Celebrity chefs Emeril Lagasse and Charlie Trotter, as well as John Williams, the Executive Chef at the Ritz, have all stated that they were fans of &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; as children.

==Personal life==
Having first met when they were both around 11 years old, Kerr married Treena Van Doorne, an English actress, on 22 September 1955, at St. Mildred&#x27;s Church, Tenterden in Kent, where Kerr&#x27;s parents had a Pub and Inn called &quot;The Woolpack&quot;. They had three children together: Tessa (born 1956), Andrew (born 1960), and Kareena (born 1968). Treena Kerr died on 17 September 2015, five days before their 60th wedding anniversary.

Kerr resided in Mount Vernon, Washington, for several years. He moved to a retirement home in Warm Beach, Washington, in 2015, and tours the area. Kerr remarried in 2024.

He is a Christian

===&quot;Television Cookbooks&quot;===
In addition, seven volumes of &quot;Television Cookbooks&quot;, featuring recipes from &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; series, were published from 1969 to 1971 by Fremantle International, the show&#x27;s syndicator. Four versions were known to exist—a regular version and three additional versions released in conjunction with KABC-TV in Los Angeles, CBC Television in Canada, and the BBC in Britain. The Fremantle and KABC versions were hardcover, and the CBC and BBC versions, though identical in content, were softcover and GBC–bound, with different covers (with the BBC version under the title &quot;Entertaining with Kerr&quot;). These cookbooks were generally sold by mail order through the television series.

In 1972, the cookbooks were re-released with new colour covers and sold in bookshops. This new version was sold by Paperback Library but, despite the publisher&#x27;s name, the books were hardcover.

<text>All-Time Quarterback (stylized ¡All-Time Quarterback!) was a solo side-project of Ben Gibbard, best known as the singer/guitarist for Death Cab for Cutie and as one third of the Postal Service.

Gibbard started the project in the spring of 1997, and a series of songs resulted in two lo-fi EPs, &quot;¡All-Time Quarterback!&quot; and &quot;The Envelope Sessions&quot;, released in 1999 on Elsinor Records, which was documenting the Bellingham, Washington music scene. Gibbard had also started Death Cab for Cutie in 1997, a second side-project which eventually grew into a full band. A small tour occurred in 1999 to support the releases, but afterwards Gibbard went back to Death Cab for Cutie to record their second album. The song &quot;Underwater!&quot; from &quot;The Envelope Sessions&quot; was later re-recorded by Death Cab for Cutie for a 7&quot; single on Sub Pop Records.

In 2002, with both original releases out-of-print, Barsuk Records released an album on CD titled &quot;¡All-Time Quarterback!&quot;. The album contains songs from both releases, along with an outtake from the original EP sessions and a video for &quot;Plans Get Complex&quot;, which was shot in a variety of locations across London, including Regent Street and a London Underground train.

<text>Manis (&quot;spirit&quot;) is a genus of South Asian and East Asian pangolins, the Asiatic pangolins, from subfamily Maninae, within family Manidae.

== Etymology ==
Carl Linnaeus (1758) invented the Neo-Latin generic name &quot;Manis&quot; apparently as a feminine singular form of the Latin masculine plural Manes, the Ancient Roman name for a type of spirit, after the animal&#x27;s strange appearance.

==Taxonomy==

<text>Manidae (&quot;spirits&quot;) is the only extant family of pangolins. This family comprises three genera (&quot;Manis&quot; from subfamily Maninae, &quot;Phataginus&quot; from subfamily Phatagininae, and &quot;Smutsia&quot; from subfamily Smutsiinae), as well as the extinct Fayum pangolin.

== Classification and phylogeny ==
=== History of classification ===
All species of living pangolin had been assigned to the genus &quot;Manis&quot; until the late 2000s, when research prompted the splitting of extant pangolins into three genera: &quot;Manis&quot;, &quot;Phataginus&quot;, and &quot;Smutsia&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===

<text>Lieutenant Boyd Alexander (16 January 1873 – 2 April 1910) was an English officer in the British Army, as well as an explorer and ornithologist.

== Early life ==
Boyd was the oldest son (with a twin brother) of Lt Colonel Boyd Francis Alexander. On his mother&#x27;s side he was the grandson of David Wilson, the founder of the Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta. He was born at Swifts Park at Cranbrook in Kent and educated at Radley and Sandhurst.

Alexander was commissioned in a Militia battalion of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), and in October 1900 took up a commission in a regular battalion of that regiment. Promotion to lieutenant followed on 22 January 1902.

During 1902 he visited the Gold Coast Colony, where he made an ornithological survey of that colony, and in September that year he left for the Bonin Islands to investigate their avifauna.

== African expedition ==
Lieutenant Alexander was a member of an expedition which travelled across Africa from the Niger to the Nile, exploring the Chad Basin. Alexander was accompanied by his brother Claud, Captain G. B. Gosling and Portuguese collector José Lopes. In February 1904 they set off from the mouth of the Niger, travelling upriver to Lokoja. Claud died in October of enteric fever after making a survey of the Murchison Range. Boyd and Gosling explored the area around Lake Chad. Gosling died in June 1906 at Niangara of blackwater fever. Boyd then followed the Kibali River, reaching the Nile late in the year and returning to England in February 1907. Alexander&#x27;s account &quot;From the Niger to the Nile&quot; was published later that year. In 1908 he was awarded the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society &quot;for his three years&#x27; journey across Africa from the Niger to the Nile.&quot;

He described Willcocks&#x27;s honeyguide on the basis of a specimen obtained on his 1901 expedition along the Volta river. His enthusiasm for Lake Chad was such that he and his twin brother Robert had a miniature replica of Lake Chad made alongside their family home, The Swifts, at Cranbrook.

Alexander and Lopes sailed back to Africa in 1909. They visited Claud&#x27;s grave at Maifoni in Bornu and then continued to Wadai. Boyd was killed in a dispute with locals near Nyeri, north of Abéché, the capital of Wadai. His body was recovered by French soldiers and buried next to his brother in Maifoni. Shortly before he departed on the expedition he had become engaged to Olive MacLeod; she travelled to visit his remote grave.

== Legacy ==
At St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Cranbrook, there is an alabaster memorial to Boyd and Claud Alexander by William Robert Colton.

Alexander&#x27;s medals are in the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum.

<text>The  (), often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Germany for security police. In the Nazi era, it referred to the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (criminal police; Kripo) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was incorporated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of World War II in Europe.

==Origins==

The term originated in August 1919 when the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; set up the &quot;Sicherheitswehr&quot; as a militarised police force to take action during times of riots or strikes. Owing to limitations in army numbers, it was renamed the to avoid attention. They wore a green uniform, and were sometimes called the &quot;Green Police&quot;. It was a military body, recruiting largely from the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, with NCOs and officers from the old Imperial German Army.

==Nazi era==
When the Nazis came to national power in 1933, Germany, as a federal state, had myriad local and centralized police agencies, which often were un-coordinated and had overlapping jurisdictions. Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s plan was to fully absorb all the police and security apparatus into the structure of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). To this end, Himmler took command first of the Gestapo (itself developed from the Prussian Secret Police). Then on 17 June 1936 all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment of Himmler as &quot;Chef der Deutschen Polizei&quot; (Chief of German Police). As such he was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, but in practice Himmler answered only to Hitler.

Himmler immediately reorganised the police, with the state agencies statutorily divided into two groups: the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Kripo and Gestapo. Heydrich was appointed chief of the SiPo and was already head of the party &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (Security Service; SD) and the Gestapo. The two police branches were commonly known as the Orpo and SiPo (Kripo and Gestapo combined), respectively.

The idea was to fully identify and integrate the party agency (SD) with the state agency (SiPo). Most of the SiPo members were encouraged or volunteered to become members of the SS and many held a rank in both organisations. Nevertheless, in practice there was jurisdictional overlap and operational conflict between the SD and Gestapo. The Kripo kept a level of independence since its structure was longer-established. Himmler founded the &quot;Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei&quot; in order to create a centralized main office under Heydrich&#x27;s overall command of the SiPo.

The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were formed under the direction of Heydrich and operated by the SS under the SiPo and SD. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; had its origins in the ad hoc &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the SiPo, two units of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.

==Merger==
In September 1939, with the founding of the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot;; RSHA), the as a functioning state agency ceased to exist as the department was merged into the RSHA. Further, the RSHA obtained overall command of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units from that time forward. Members of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units at this point were drawn from the SS, the SD and the police. They were used during the invasion of Poland to forcefully de-politicise the Polish people and murder members of groups most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, members of the clergy, teachers, and members of the nobility. When the units were re-formed prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the men of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo and Waffen-SS. These mobile death squads were active in the implementation of the Final Solution in the territories overrun by the Nazi forces.

<text>Vijay Kumar Patodi (12 March 1945 – 21 December 1976) was an Indian mathematician who made fundamental contributions to differential geometry and topology. He was the first mathematician to apply heat equation methods to the proof of the index theorem for elliptic operators. He was a professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (Bombay).

==Education==
Patodi was a graduate of Government High School, Guna, Madhya Pradesh. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Vikram University, Ujjain, his master&#x27;s degree from the Benaras Hindu University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Bombay under the guidance of M. S. Narasimhan and S. Ramanan at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

In the two papers based on his Ph.D. thesis, &quot;Curvature and Eigenforms of the Laplace Operator&quot; (&quot;Journal of Differential Geometry&quot;), and &quot;An Analytical Proof of the Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch Formula for Kaehler Manifolds&quot; (also &quot;Journal of Differential Geometry&quot;), Patodi made his fundamental breakthroughs.

==Research career==
He was invited to spend 1971–1973 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he collaborated with Michael Atiyah, Isadore Singer, and Raoul Bott. The joint work led to a series of papers, &quot;Spectral Asymmetry and Riemannian Geometry&quot; with Atiyah and Singer, in which the η-invariant was defined. This invariant was to play a major role in subsequent advances in the area in the 1980s.

Patodi was promoted to full professor at Tata Institute at age 30, however, he died at age 31, as a result of complications prior to surgery for a kidney transplant.

<doc id="1163113" wikidata="Q990385" url="?curid=1163113" title="Horta, Azores">
<text>Horta () is a municipality and city in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores encompassing the island of Faial. The population in 2011 was 15,038 in an area of The city of Horta itself has a population of about 7,000.

Horta&#x27;s marina is a primary stop for yachts crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and its walls and walkways are covered with paintings created by visitors noting the names of their vessels, crews, and the years they visited. Peter&#x27;s Cafe Sport is a bar located across from the marina that houses the island&#x27;s scrimshaw museum, a collection of artifacts carved from whale tooth and jawbone. Peter&#x27;s is a point of reference for transatlantic yachters and sailors.

The Legislative Assembly of the Azores is located in Horta, making it Azores&#x27; legislative capital.

==History==
===15th through 17th centuries===
In 1467 the Flemish nobleman Josse van Huerter returned to Faial on a second expedition, this time disembarking along the shore of what would be known as Horta Bay. He built a small chapel which would later form the nucleus of a small community known as Horta, a name possibly derived from the transliteration of his name. In the Portuguese language the word &quot;horta&quot; means &quot;orchard,&quot; another possible origin of the settlement&#x27;s name. The infante D. Fernando, Duke of Viseu, granted Huerter the first captaincy of the island on February 2, 1468.

Unlike on other Azorean islands, Flemish peasants and business interests were not the first settlers of Faial. The first Faialense settlers were generally farmers from continental Portugal—particularly northern Portugal—hoping to escape poverty. Huerter eventually cultivated new business opportunities in Flanders, attracting a second wave of Flemish settlers under the stewardship of Willem van der Haegen (later transliterated to &quot;Guilherme da Silveira&quot;), who brought Flemish administrators, tradesmen, settlers, and other compatriots to settle on Faial.

Huerter&#x27;s son Joss de Utra (who would become the second Captain-General) and his daughter D. Joana de Macedo (who married Martin Behaim at the Santa Cruz chapel) continued living on Faial long after van Huerter&#x27;s death. In 1498 King Manuel I of Portugal decreed Horta elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; (&quot;town&quot;), as its center had grown to the north from the area around the Santa Cruz chapel. The island prospered by exporting wheat and woad-derived dyes.

On June 28, 1514, the parish of Matriz do São Salvador da Horta was constituted and services were begun. In 1567 the cornerstone of what would be the Fort of Santa Cruz was laid. Horta&#x27;s increasing population compelled the creation of the parishes of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (July 30, 1568) and Nossa Senhora da Angustias (November 28, 1684) by the diocese of Angra. As two nuclei developed around Santa Cruz and Porto Pim, growth also extended around the older Matriz, where the Tower Clock now stands, and the public square, where &quot;Alameda Barão de Roches&quot; now exists. Public buildings were erected between &quot;Rua Visconde Leite Perry&quot; and &quot;Rua Arriage Nunes&quot; and eventually the town hall and court offices moved to the former Jesuit College, after the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal in 1758.

In 1583—during the beginning of the Iberian Union—Spanish soldiers under the command of D. Pedro de Toledo landed in Pasteleiro on Faial&#x27;s southwestern coast. After skirmishing at the doors of the fort, the Spanish executed Captain of Faial António Guedes de Sousa. Four years later George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland—while commanding a fleet of 13 British ships in the Azores Voyage of 1589—captured a Spanish ship and then plundered Faial&#x27;s churches and convents, profaning them and destroying reliquaries and crucifixes. The British captured several artillery pieces and set fire to houses within the Fort of Santa Cruz. In 1597 a new British force under Walter Raleigh, second in command to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, sacked and burned religious buildings and churches in Horta and the neighboring parishes of Flamengos, Feteira, and Praia do Almoxarife. The constant threat of privateers and pirates forced the construction of several forts and lookouts.

In 1643, Horta had about 2579 inhabitants and 610 homes. In 1675 D. Frei Lourenço, Bishop of Angra, authorized the renovation and re-ornamentation of the chapel of Santa Cruz. This work was completed in 1688.

===18th and 19th centuries===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Horta was a small town extending along the shoreline. It was peppered by various convents and churches, but little commerce and almost no industry. However, due to its central location in the Azores and Atlantic Ocean, it prospered as a stopover on important commercial routes between Europe and the Americas. For a time Horta was a center of commerce and travel, particularly as a gateway for Azorean orange exports and exports of wine from Pico Island, as well as an important stop for North American whalers, and later as a refueling port for coal-powered ships during their transatlantic passages.

In 1804 John Bass Dabney (1766–1826), the United States Consul General in the Azores, married Roxanne Lewis and moved to a home in Horta. Their son Charles William Dabney (who later married Francis Alsop Pomeroy) succeeded his father in this position and played an important part in the history and economy of Horta and Faial. This was helped by the construction of a commercial port in 1876 and the installation of transatlantic telegraph cables in 1893. The Dabney family steered the island&#x27;s economy for 83 years with good effect on the dynamic growth of the port, the export of oranges and Verdelho wine from Pico, and commerce related to the whaling industry.

On September 26, 1814, the American privateer brig &quot;General Armstrong&quot;, under the command of Samuel Chester Reid, was sunk by three ships of the British Royal Navy under the command of Robert Lloyd. After being forced to scuttle his ship, Reid formally protested the ship&#x27;s destruction in a neutral port, criticizing Portuguese incapacity to defend their own waters. Her principal piece of naval artillery, the cannon &quot;Long Tom&quot;, was later recovered from Horta Bay. It was eventually offered to General Batcheller, the United States Minister in Lisbon, in compensation. General Batcheller returned to Horta to pick up the cannon and delivered it to New York City on board the ship USS &quot;Vega&quot; on or about April 18, 1893.

On July 4, 1833, the &quot;vila&quot; of Horta, through the initiative of the Duke d&#x27;Ávila and Bolama, was elevated to the status of city and the district capital as a reward for Faial&#x27;s support of Liberal forces during the Portuguese Liberal Revolution. The city hall&#x27;s coat of arms were changed to read “Very Loyal City of Horta” by decree of King Luís I of Portugal on May 3, 1865.

Construction of Horta&#x27;s commercial port in 1876 increased the city&#x27;s international importance. On August 23, 1893, the first telegraph cables linking Horta (Alagoa) and Lisbon (Carcavelos) made Horta a link in transatlantic communication. The presence of several foreign cable companies in Horta increased the economic activity and development, urban growth, and frequency of cultural and sporting activities on the island. Between 1893 and 1969 Horta was an important post in intercontinental communications.

=== 20th century ===
Horta entered into the annals of early aviation history when United States Navy Captain Albert Cushing Read completed the first Atlantic leg of the first transatlantic flight when he landed his Curtiss NC-4 floatplane in the Bay of Horta in May 1919.
In 1921 Dutch seagoing tugboats began using Horta as a stopover. After a hiatus during World War II, they returned during the period of European reconstruction.

After 1939 Horta was a scheduled waypoint on the transatlantic flying boat routes between North America and Europe, including the Pan Am Clipper fleet which docked in Horta harbour.

By 1960 yachts started using Horta&#x27;s sheltered port during transatlantic voyages.

On 24 August 1971, in the civil parish of Castelo Branco, President of Portugal Américo Tomás inaugurated the Horta Airport. Since 1972 the &quot;Sociedade Açoreana de Transportes Aéreos&quot; (which was the forerunner of SATA Air Azores) has provided scheduled flights from Horta to the islands of the &quot;triangle&quot; (Central Group). During the 1980s TAP Air Portugal, the national flag carrier, established direct service from Horta to Lisbon, while further fleet improvements allowed SATA to directly link Horta with all Azorean islands. Following major renovations in December 2001, the airport was designated an international airport, although no foreign airlines have scheduled or charter flights arriving at Horta Airport.

Periodic improvements to Horta harbour allowed the city to become a stopover for yachts and cruise ships and provide ongoing assistance to transatlantic voyagers. This was facilitated when the municipal authority inaugurated a 300-slip marina on 3 June 1986. Horta harbour is a fleet centre for the Azorean ferry lines Transmaçor and Atlanticoline, resulting in new investments and the construction of a secondary pier for inter-island passenger traffic.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
===Climate===
Horta has the typical humid subtropical climate with significant Mediterranean influences associated with the Azores. Horta, along with nearby Madalena is one of the Azorean cities most prone to high temperatures, and unlike Angra do Heroísmo and Ponta Delgada, temperatures above have been recorded on a few occasions. Averages, however, are extremely similar to the aforementioned cities. Precipitation averages about per year and is concentrated from September to February. On average November is the wettest month, while July is the driest. Temperatures are mild to warm year-round and average in the daytime and at night.

===Human geography===

Three parishes comprise the urban area of the city of Horta (the urbanized area and historical center): Angústias, Conceição, and Matriz. The remaining parishes comprising the rest of the municipality are located along the Regional E.R.1-1ª road network, and includes lands from the ocean to the central volcano (with the exception of Flamengos, which is the only landlocked parish). Faial Island, comprising Horta&#x27;s urbanized area and the parishes, has an area of 

* Capelo - located in the western portion of the island that includes the most recent historic volcanism on the island; location of the Capelinhos Volcano and Recreational Forest Park
* Castelo Branco - located on the southern coastal area between Capelo and Feteiras; location of Horta International Airport
* Cedros - largest civil parish and agricultural lands, located on the northern coast between Capelo and Salão
* Feteira - southern parish located between the urbanized core of Horta and Castelo Branco; primarily agricultural activities in transition into suburban community of Horta
* Flamengos - the only landlocked civil parish on the island, established by original settlers from the Low Countries of Europe
* Pedro Miguel - located to the north of Praia do Almoxarife, along the eastern coast
* Praia do Almoxarife - original settlers disembarked along the beach of Praia do Almoxarife during the original 1465 and 1467 expeditions; currently the main tourist beach community on the island
* Praia do Norte - located between Cedros and Capelo, a zone affected by historic volcanism from the Capelo Volcanic Complex
* Ribeirinha - a civil parish occupying the ancient geological zone that formed the island of Faial
* Salão - settled by Spanish during the Iberian Union, and located between Cedros and Ribeirinha

In 2011, the national census discovered a resident population of 15,038: a slight decrease from the 2001 population (15,063 inhabitants). Yet, the number of aggregate families grew significantly (4795 to 5465 families reporting their participation in such groups), an increase from 2.8 to 3.1 people per family. Similarly, there has been a 21.69% increase in the number occupied buildings within the municipality.

====City of Horta====


From Espalamaca or Monte da Guia, the city of Horta is typical of insular Portuguese coastal communities and the urban traditions of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The city is seaward looking, much like Angra do Heroísmo or Velas. It is rounded by several volcanic cones located to its southern and eastern margins, the most prominent being Monte da Guaia, Monte do Carneiro, and Monte Escuro. Horta is centered along its principal avenue—referred to as either Avenida Marginal or Avenida D. Infante Henriques—and cut by several smaller roads. The city&#x27;s historical center lies to the north near Espalamaca, with a grouping of north–south and east–west roads developed during initial colonization. The population of Horta&#x27;s urban center during the first decade of the 21st century was about 7,000.

Horta grew from streets such as:
* Rua Vista Alegre/Ladeira da Paiva/travessa Almeida Garrett (that includes the Church Matriz, and Convent of Saint John);
* Rua Advogado Graça/Travessa do Poiso Novo (where the original Casa da Câmara and Convent of Glory were situated);
* Rua de São Paulo;
* Rua de São Pedro and Travessa da Misericórdia; and,
* Rua Dr. Azevedo and Calçada M. Vila, near the entrance to the Largo do Colégio.
* Rua de São João
* Rua Ten. Aragão (currently between the Império dos Nobres and the Sociedade Amor da Pátria)
* Rua da Conceição/Alameda Barão de Roches/Rua D. Pedro IV/Rua E. Rebelo, with the Pelourinho, the Casa da Câmara and older urban prison (Cadeia), the Convent of Glory, this area constituted the original Vila of Horta. The oldest dwellings and the older ornate façades are located in this area.
* Rua Maestro Simaria, located near the Rua Serpa Pinto, and the ancient Largo do Colégio Jesuíta;
* Rua Conselheiro Miguel da Silveira, and open to the Avenida Marginal.

These streets formed from the central colony along hills parallel to each other and perpendicular to the ocean. Littoral growth was made cautiously until the town square, civic center, town hall, and local water wells were built along the seashore in both directions. Religious institutions generally mark the extent of urbanized–rural limits (as the Convent of Nossa Senhora do Carmo and Convent of the Capuchos do today to the northeast).

Modern Horta grew beyond the limits of this early colonization. A secondary nucleus grew in the area of Porto Pim, and infilling occurred sporadically until a crescent formed along the banks of the east coast, only contained by Ponte de Espalamaca to the north and open ocean to the south. The cinder cones in the south likely protected settlers and ships from the north Atlantic weather systems. Horta grew slowly into the river valleys of Faial&#x27;s interior, linking the parishes of Flamengos to the west and Feteira to the southwest to form an incomplete urbanized mass. The nodes of growth basically follow the road network, including the recently completed &quot;Scute&quot; (freeway) that bypasses the southern E.R.1-1ª road between Angustias and Feteira.

==Twin towns — Sister cities==

Horta is twinned with:

==Economy==
Due to its central position in the &quot;Triangle&quot; of islands in the Azores&#x27;s Central Group, Horta has been the focus of economic activity on Faial. It was the staging and export centre for many of the economic cycles of the region: the export of woad-derived dyes, oranges, whale oil, and Pico-grown Verdelho wines historically built Faial&#x27;s economy. Many of the landed gentry concentrated their shops, production facilities, and homes in the city, while agricultural goods were shipped to the city before being sent on to Europe or North America. For a long time, the island of Pico was an exclave of Horta with summer homes, agricultural parcels, and herds owned by residents of Faial, until its emancipation on 8 March 1723.

After the failure of the economic cycles through boom-and-bust economies (brought on by weather, plant disease, or market deviation), the city of Horta became a staging point for transatlantic shipment firstly for whaling fleets, and later for the submarine cable companies that laid communication lines between Europe and North America. These spurts of growth concentrated the population and political and economic classes within Horta, and economic activities on Faial.

Horta today is polarized between the same dichotomy that existed between the hinter- and heartlands, with most primary economic activities (agricultural mostly) dispersed into the parishes, while the secondary and tertiary activities are concentrated in the three main parishes (Angústias, Conceição and Matriz). In addition, the prosperity of the early 20th century, concentrated on the transatlantic traffic, has developed into a tourist-oriented economy concentrated on the architecture, geographic, leisure, and sociocultural aspects of the island. This includes sightseeing tours and whale-watching expeditions departing from the city, the arrival of semi-weekly cruise ships during the summer, and cultural festivals that unite local residents and visitors throughout the year.

==Transportation==

The island is circled by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway which directly connects all parish centres (except Flamengos) with the city Horta. Apart from personal vehicles, a bus system provides daily access to the city from the outer parishes.

The centre of most activity in the municipality is Horta&#x27;s port and passenger terminal which, until 28 July 2012, was located south of the Fort of Santa Cruz in the parish of Angustias. The passenger ferries operated by Transmaçor (the &quot;Cruzeiro do Canal&quot; and &quot;Cruzeiro da Ilha&quot;) provided passenger service to and from the island of Pico (Madalena), while Atlânticoline (using contracted ships) provided inter-island service to the remaining islands from the main dock across the harbour. On 28 July 2012, a new passenger ferry and dock was inaugurated across the harbour at the mouth of the &quot;Ribeira da Conceição&quot; across from the old District Courthouse. A €33 million project, the dock was started in 2009, and resulted in a long wharf, with a long by wide usable docking space containing two ramps for roll-on/roll-off operation, with the express purpose of supporting passenger traffic within the &quot;triangle&quot; islands of the central Azores. A long embankment in area was also built to protect the Ribeira da Conceição. The project involved changes to the road network in the area, parking areas, pavement and green-spaces, as well as new public illumination, water supply, telecommunications, and fueling resources. In addition to these improvements, Transmaçor acquired two new ships to be brought into service by the end of 2014 in order to support the island&#x27;s tourist economy. At the new wharf&#x27;s inauguration, President of the Azorean Regional Government Carlos Cesar indicated the importance of inter-island traffic for the islands, which for 16 years had transported 290,000 passengers annually (and now is beyond 400,000).

==In literature==
The city contains the Horta Regional Museum which has a permanent exhibit, &quot;Exhibition of Capelinhos Volcano&quot;, detailing in photographs the 1957 volcanic eruption in the Azores. The museum also contains a large collection of scale models of buildings, ships, and people carved from fig kernels by Euclides Rosa.

Mark Twain visited Horta in June 1867 near the beginning of a long pleasure excursion to Jerusalem. He described his visit with acerbic commentary on the people and culture of Horta in his semi-autobiographical book &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;. In the book Twain compliments Horta&#x27;s physical appearance:
:&quot;The town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheatre of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear to their summits - not a foot of soil left idle.&quot;

However, Twain painted a less complimentary picture of the inhabitants of Horta and Faial at the time:
:&quot;The group on the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.&quot;

:&quot;The community is eminently Portuguese — that is to say, it is slow, poor, shiftless, sleepy, and lazy. There is a civil governor, appointed by the King of Portugal; and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure. [...] there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep...There is not a wheelbarrow in the land [...] There is not a modern plow in the islands, or a threshing-machine. All attempts to introduce them have failed. The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him. [...] The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead. The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep with.&quot;

Joshua Slocum, sailing the sloop &quot;Spray&quot;, stopped in Horta on the first leg of his solo global circumnavigation, which he chronicled in his 1899 book &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;. Jules Verne mentioned Horta in his fictional tales.

In works by Portuguese writers Vitorino Nemésio (&quot;O Corsário das Ilhas&quot;) and Raul Brandão (&quot;As ilhas Desconhecidas&quot;), Faial is a focus of the story.

==Notable citizens==
*Manuel de Arriaga (1840-1917), the first President of Portugal
*Maria Branco (1842–1887), Azorean midwife from Horta for the Dabney family
* Euclides Rosa (Horta, Azores; c.1910 - São Paulo, Brazil c. 1979), engineer and artist, who worked for one of the early telegraph cable companies at the turn of the century, until 1946, when he abandoned his job to become an artist. Recognized as the &quot;Mestre do &quot;Miolo de Figueira&quot;&quot; (&quot;Master of Fig Tree Pith&quot;) he was acclaimed for his complex and elaborate sculptures of pith/wood, with a permanent collection in the Museum of Horta (donated in 1980).

<text>Roy Dotrice (26 May 1923 – 16 October 2017) was a British stage and screen actor. He played the antiquarian John Aubrey in the solo play &quot;Brief Lives&quot;. He won a Tony Award for his performance in the 2000 Broadway revival of &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;, also appearing as Leopold Mozart in the film version of &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), Charles Dickens in &quot;Dickens of London&quot; (1976), and Jacob Wells/Father in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

Late in life, he narrated a series of audiobooks for George R. R. Martin&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, for which he holds the Guinness World Record for the most character voices by an individual for an audiobook.

==Life and career==
Dotrice was born in Guernsey, Bailiwick of Guernsey on 26 May 1923 to Neva (née Wilton; 1897–1984) and Louis Dotrice (1896–1991). He served as a wireless operator/air gunner with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and was imprisoned in a German prisoner of war camp from 1942 to 1945, after being shot down in an Avro Lancaster R5840 of No.106 Squadron based at Coningsby, all seven airmen of the crew being taken Prisoner of War.

===Radio===
Dotrice was the voice of &quot;Permanent Under-Secretary Sir Gregory Pitkin&quot; in the early episodes of BBC Radio&#x27;s long-running comedy &quot;The Men from the Ministry&quot;. He was succeeded by Ronald Baddiley in the role. He also played the caretaker Ramsay alongside Patricia Hayes in the Radio 2 sitcom &quot;Know Your Place&quot;.

===Theatre===
Dotrice was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and in the early 1960s played a variety of roles, including Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, opposite Tom Fleming&#x27;s Prospero (dir: Peter Brook), John of Gaunt and Hotspur opposite David Warner&#x27;s Richard II, and Justice Shallow, opposite Hugh Griffith as Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV&quot;, and then Edward IV in the Hall/Barton-adapted Shakespeare cycle &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, later broadcast by the BBC.

Dotrice played the part of John Aubrey in &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, a one-man play devised and directed by Patrick Garland in which he held the stage for almost three hours (including the interval, during which he would feign sleep). Premiering in 1967 at the Hampstead Theatre in London, the play later toured England, before two productions on Broadway. In 1968 it moved to the Criterion Theatre in the West End, where it ran for 400 performances before transferring to the Mayfair Theatre. He revived the role in 2008, again under Patrick Garland&#x27;s direction.

These runs, combined with extensive international touring, earned Dotrice a place in the Guinness World Records for the greatest number of solo performances (1,782). 

His other one-man productions included &quot;Mister Lincoln&quot; in 1979, and &quot;Churchill&quot; in 1982, both premiering in Washington, D.C. at Ford&#x27;s Theatre.

In 1984 he starred opposite Rosemary Harris in a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;. He appeared in the stage production of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; at The Lowry theatre in Salford from November 2009 to January 2010.

===Television===
In the 1970s Dotrice played Charles Dickens in the television mini-series &quot;Dickens of London&quot;. He also appeared as Albert Haddock in the BBC television adaptation of A. P. Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Misleading Cases&quot; in 1971. In 1972 he played the Curé Ponosse in the BBC2 TV adaptation of &quot;Clochemerle&quot; (1972).

Dotrice played &quot;Father&quot; in the 1980s TV series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and Father Gary Barrett, a Catholic priest, in the 1990s series &quot;Picket Fences&quot;. His acting career dates from 1945 in a revue called &quot;Back Home&quot;, performed by former prisoners-of-war in aid of the Red Cross. In an episode of &quot;Angel&quot; (1999), part of the Buffyverse, he played the role of Roger Wyndam-Pryce, the overbearing father of the character Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. An earlier science-fiction role was Commissioner Simmonds in two episodes of the 1970s series &quot;&quot;. In 1998 Dotrice appeared in three episodes of the series &quot;&quot; as Zeus.

===&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;===
In June 2010 it was announced that Dotrice would be playing the role of Grand Maester Pycelle in the HBO television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; books. He later withdrew from the part for medical reasons and Julian Glover was cast in his place.

Shortly after filming for the second season commenced it was confirmed that Dotrice would be returning to play &quot;Wisdom Hallyne the Pyromancer&quot;, who is featured in the installments &quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal&quot; and &quot;Blackwater&quot;.

===Radio and audiobooks===
In 1982 BBC Radio 4 broadcast Dotrice&#x27;s reading of G.B. Edwards&#x27; novel &quot;The Book of Ebenezer Le Page&quot; in twenty-eight 15-minute parts on its &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; segment. The producer subsequently wrote that the serialisation was &quot;without question the most popular serial I have ever done in the 500 or so I have produced in the last 21 years ...&quot;.

He subsequently performed &quot;The Islander&quot;, a stage version of &quot;The Book of Ebenezer Le Page&quot;, to critical success at the Theatre Royal Lincoln. In 2012 AudioGO produced a complete and unabridged recording of &quot;Ebenezer Le Page&quot;, which is available on Audible.

Dotrice recorded audiobooks for each book in George R. R. Martin&#x27;s series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. In 2011 he was awarded the world record for most character voices in an audiobook for his recording of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, which contained 224.

Dotrice also narrated many storybook adaptations for Disney Records, including &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award.

==Personal life and death==
Dotrice was married to Kay Newman (1929–2007), a television and stage actress, from 1947 until her death in 2007. They had three daughters—Michele, Yvette and Karen—all of whom have acted at various times in their lives. He was the father-in-law of actors Edward Woodward (Michele) and Alex Hyde-White (Karen).

Dotrice was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours. He died at the age of 94 on 16 October 2017 in London; no cause was given.

<text>Nicotiana glauca is a species of flowering plant in the tobacco genus Nicotiana of the nightshade family Solanaceae. It is known by the common name tree tobacco. Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other &quot;Nicotiana&quot; species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither nor sticky like &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;. It resembles &quot;Cestrum parqui&quot; but differs in the form of leaves and fusion of the outer floral parts. It grows to heights of more than two meters.

Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats.

==Description==
&quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot; is a small tree or shrub with many branches that normally grows to over 2 m, but can reach as high as 7 m. Its leaves are thick and rubbery and can be up to 20 cm long. It has yellow tubular flowers about 5 cm long and 1 cm wide. The plant primarily reproduces by seed.

==Ecology==
&quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot; can pose a threat to native species by outcompeting them for resources and is classified as an invasive species in many parts of the world. In some management programmes, the beetle &quot;Malabris aculeata&quot; has been successfully deployed as a biological control agent. Every part of the plant is potentially poisonous to humans and livestock.

==Distribution==
It is originally native to South America (including Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador), but has been naturalized globally. It is found in Australia, warmer parts of Europe, temperate Asia, Canarian Archipelago, New Zealand, the United States, Mexico, Hawaii, and Sub-Saharan Africa (including Kenya and Tanzania, where it is invasive, as well as Uganda).

It grows in a wide variety of open and disturbed habitats including lakeshores and roadsides, but is mainly a problem in relatively dry areas.

==Names==
The plant is commonly known in English as tree tobacco, Brazilian tree tobacco, shrub tobacco, wild tobacco, tobacco tree, tobacco bush, tobacco plant, and mustard tree. 

In Spanish and throughout Latin America, it is known by many names, including (&quot;Moorish tobacco&quot;), , and .

Its botanical name, &quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot;, was given to it in 1828 by Robert Graham. The genus is named after Jean Nicot (1604), a French ambassador to Portugal, who sent tobacco seeds and powdered leaves from Lisbon to France.

==Phylogeny==
There are around 76 species in the &quot;Nicotiana&quot; genus, the sole member of the &quot;Nicotianeae&quot; tribe. Phylogenetic research suggests the following species are closely related:

==Uses==
The plant is used for a variety of medicinal purposes by Native American groups. The Cahuilla people used leaves interchangeably with other tobacco species in religious rituals and as a poultice to treat swellings, bruises, cuts, wounds, boils, sores, inflamed throat, and swollen glands. It contains high doses of the alkaloids anabasine and nicotine such that ingestion of the leaves can be fatal. It is being investigated for use as a biofuel.

<doc id="1163123" wikidata="Q5365251" url="?curid=1163123" title="Ellesmere Port Dock">
<text>Ellesmere Port Dock is a dock in Britain, situated on the Manchester Ship Canal, in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, England.

==History==
Ellesmere Canal is the name of the area were the canal joins the river Mersey; by the mid-1790s it was known as Ellesmere Port. Docks and warehouses were built to facilitate this.
Between 1830 and the 1840s facilities were improved by the engineer Thomas Telford and others. In 1846 the Ellesmere Canal was amalgamated with the Shropshire Union Canal.
In 1892 a new wharf was built to handle traffic on the Manchester Ship Canal.

In 1921 the docks were leased to the Manchester Ship Canal, and this led to the decline of Ellesmere Port.

==20th century==
The site is now the National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port (formerly known as the Boat Museum).

==21st century==
In 2007, as part of a revival of some industries, ports and shipbuilding in Britain, Ellesmere Port docks were re-opened. In 2008 the site of Ellesmere Port&#x27;s operational dock - including over of the waterfront area (immediately to the north-west of Ellesmere Port Historic Dock and Conservation Area and to the south-east of the Bridgewater Paper Works) - was the subject of a planning consultation, in which it may have been proposed that the docks be relocated closer to Eastham on the Cheshire West and Chester/Wirral boundary, and the area be redeveloped into a predominantly residential area consisting of up to 8,000 new homes. Plans for such development were expected to be submitted to the Local Authority during early 2009.

<text>Tranmere Oil Terminal is situated on the River Mersey, south of Birkenhead. It was opened on 8 June 1960 to handle vessels of up to 65,000 tons, at two berths (North and South). It is connected to the Stanlow Oil Refinery by a crude oil pipeline. and a fuel oil pipeline. Part of the terminal occupies the site of a former ferry service to Liverpool, with the extant pier considerably modified.

The terminal is operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company.

==History==
The terminal was built jointly by Shell Oil, then the owner of Stanlow Oil Refinery, and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at a cost of £6 million. It was built to replace the role of the Herculaneum Dock and the later Eastham Oil Terminal which had only been inaugurated in 1954, but which did not have sufficient water depth to handle the 65,000 ton vessels that were operating by 1960.

By 2001, the terminal had two converted crude oil tanks which could handle . These were used for the storage of crude oil from the Foinaven oilfield.

==Current operations==
All the crude oil feedstock for Stanlow Oil Refinery is delivered via the Tranmere terminal. The terminal is capable of handling vessels of up to 65,000 tonnes, and cargo sizes up to 170,000 tonnes on part laden Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). 

Tranmere handles 140 ships every year, carrying a total of 9 million tonnes of crude oil.

The size and operating pressure of the pipelines between Tranmere and Stanlow are as shown:

The minimum water depth at Tranmere is 40 ft. (12.2 m), and there is a tidal range of 30 ft. (9.14 m).

<doc id="1163151" wikidata="Q299122" url="?curid=1163151" title="Jeff Hanneman">
<text>Jeffrey John Hanneman (January 31, 1964 – May 2, 2013) was an American musician, best known as a founding member and co-lead guitarist of the thrash metal band Slayer. Hanneman composed both music and lyrics for every Slayer album until his death in 2013.

Born in 1964 in Long Beach, California, Hanneman listened to heavy metal and hardcore punk in his childhood and adolescence. He was working as a telemarketer in 1981 when he met Kerry King, with whom he founded Slayer. He wrote the music for many of the band&#x27;s most famous songs, such as &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, and &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;; his own favorite album was &quot;Reign in Blood.&quot; His guitar riffs, inspired by metal and punk bands such as Led Zeppelin, Wasted Youth, and Iron Maiden, have been called some of the most famous in metal, while his dual guitar solos with King have attracted high praise. 

A reserved character, Hanneman rarely gave interviews, and preferred to indulge his interest in German war medals and history. A bout of necrotizing fasciitis in early 2011 left him battling serious health issues; he was replaced on Slayer&#x27;s tours by guitarists including Gary Holt. Hanneman died of liver failure on May 2, 2013.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hanneman was born January 31, 1964, in Long Beach, California, and grew up there in a family containing several war veterans: his father fought in Normandy during World War II and his brothers in Vietnam, making warfare a common conversation topic at the dinner table. War films were popular on TV at the time, and Hanneman often joined his brothers in constructing and coloring tank and plane models. His interest in warfare and military history has been attributed to his upbringing.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine, he stated his father is German, but fought for the Allied side in World War II. In the same interview, he also goes into detail of what district of Germany his father and grandparents hail from. His grandfather was fluent in German.

Hanneman was introduced to heavy metal music as a child through his older sister Mary, when she was listening to Black Sabbath at her house. Once he reached high school, he discovered hardcore punk, which had a significant influence on his style and attitude.

===Slayer===
In 1981, Hanneman, who was working as a telemarketer at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called &quot;Ledger&quot;. King remembered: &quot;As I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that I was into, like Def Leppard&#x27;s &#x27;Wasted&#x27; and AC/DC and Priest&quot;. After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked &quot;Why don&#x27;t we start our own band?&quot;, to which Hanneman replied &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;

Hanneman stated that he was playing guitar for a year by the time he met King and put an effort into improving his skills after watching him play. Hanneman, who was heavily influenced by hardcore punk music, got the other members into the genre, leading Slayer into a faster and more aggressive approach. The band&#x27;s drummer Dave Lombardo asserted that his hardcore influences pushed him to play faster, contributing to shape his drumming style.

In 1984, Hanneman, Lombardo and Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Rocky George had a brief hardcore punk side project called &quot;Pap Smear&quot; – the band had many tracks and was due to start recording when Hanneman was advised to avoid the side project by Slayer&#x27;s producer, Rick Rubin, who is quoted as saying &quot;Aaaah, don&#x27;t do it, man – this is the kind of thing that breaks bands up!&quot; and Hanneman took Rubin&#x27;s advice. Only a demo was recorded, consisting of Hanneman on vocals and bass, Lombardo on drums and George on guitar. Later two of the songs were re-recorded on Slayer&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot;.

Early in Slayer&#x27;s career, Kerry King began to be heavily influenced by English black metal band Venom, and this influence had a big impact on Hanneman&#x27;s songwriting as well. Hanneman said in 1987 that although he had begun reading the Satanic bible for lyrical inspiration, he was far from a Satanist. He said his lyrics were typically antitheist in nature and that he hated the idea of Satanism as much as Christianity, calling them &quot;the same thing&quot;. &quot;What we&#x27;re attacking, in a roundabout way, is the Christian TV conmen. It&#x27;s unbelievable, the amount of money stolen in the name of Jesus&quot;, Hanneman said. While he conceded that much of the dark subject matter in his songs was &quot;quite ridiculous&quot;, his extreme Satanic lyrics were ultimately &quot;an easy way of offending people&quot;. Hanneman took a lot of his lyrical inspiration from books he would read. For example, he described the controversial song &quot;Angel of Death&quot; as &quot;a history lesson&quot; and that the song in no way implied he was a Nazi, saying &quot;I&#x27;d read a lot about the Third Reich and was absolutely fascinated by the extremity of it all, the way Hitler had been able to hypnotize a nation and do whatever he wanted.&quot;

===Illness and death===
In early 2011, Hanneman contracted necrotizing fasciitis on one of his arms. Reports linked this illness with a spider bite he claimed to have received while in a friend&#x27;s hot tub. Approximately one week later, an intoxicated Hanneman showed the arm to his wife, who recalled &quot;...and I just freaked out when I saw (it). It was bright red and three times the normal size. I said, &#x27;Jeff, we need to go now. We need to get you to the ER.&#x27; But all he wanted to do was go to bed and sleep...&quot;. The following morning she convinced him to seek medical attention in Loma Linda and it was learned that amputation was one possible outcome. At one point, Hanneman was placed in a medically-induced coma. Prior to surgery, hospital staff informed his wife that he may not survive. Though he did survive, his wife says the illness hindered his ability to play guitar, leading to depression &quot;and he started to lose hope&quot;.

In light of his illness and Slayer&#x27;s upcoming participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour that was set to begin on February 26, 2011, the band made the decision to play the dates without Hanneman, and on February 16, 2011, brought on Gary Holt (Exodus) to fill in for him. Pat O&#x27;Brien (Cannibal Corpse) joined as Slayer&#x27;s temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with Exodus. In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced Hanneman&#x27;s recovery from the infection, though a later update on the band&#x27;s official website noted that it had &quot;devastated his well-being&quot;. In February, 2013, King revealed that Hanneman was still battling health issues that prevented him from performing.

Hanneman died of liver failure on May 2, 2013, in a Southern California hospital near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death. Slayer expressed shock, stating in a release that &quot;it appeared that he had been improving – he was excited and looking forward to working on a new record.&quot; Holt eventually became Hanneman&#x27;s permanent replacement in Slayer, remaining with the band for the next six years until they disbanded after finishing their final tour in 2019.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Hanneman married Kathryn in Las Vegas. They had met in 1983 before the release of the debut album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;, during a Slayer show in Buena Park, California.

Hanneman was a reserved person when he was offstage. Unlike the other members, he was very selective in socializing and rarely gave interviews. As vocalist/bassist Araya said: &quot;If he didn&#x27;t like you, he wouldn&#x27;t hang with you.&quot;

===Interest in German history===

Hanneman&#x27;s interest in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated by many of his lyrics. Those interests in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; began with medals given to him by his father, including some taken from dead German soldiers. His most prized medal was his Knight&#x27;s Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1,000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy&#x27;s interest in medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

Hanneman&#x27;s lyrics for the song &quot;Angel of Death&quot; led to accusations of Slayer being Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman defended himself with &quot;I know why people misinterpret it&#x27;s because they get this knee-jerk reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there&#x27;s nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily [Josef Mengele] was a bad man, because to well, isn&#x27;t that obvious? I shouldn&#x27;t have to tell you that.&quot; The band has stated numerous times that they are not Nazis and do not condone Nazism.

==Influences and style==
Hanneman&#x27;s major influences included hard rock and heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, and hardcore punk acts such as Wasted Youth, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and T.S.O.L., which heavily influenced his contributions to Slayer&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot;. Hanneman&#x27;s and King&#x27;s dual guitar solos have been called &quot;wildly chaotic&quot;, and &quot;twisted genius&quot;. &quot;South of Heaven&quot; featured &quot;more technical&quot; guitar riffs, utilizing the aforementioned tremolo picking and down-picked notes, improving musicianship while retaining a melodic sense. Both Hanneman and King were ranked number 10 in &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

John Consterdine of &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine noted: &quot;without Jeff Hanneman, Slayer certainly would not have created some of the most famous riffs in metal, which undoubtedly changed the entire genre&quot;. According to Jeff Kitts of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he &quot;influenced a generation and changed the course of metal forever&quot;. Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse, who considers Hanneman his major influence as a composer, regarded him as &quot;one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in metal&quot; and Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom described him as &quot;one of the fathers of metal&quot;.

Alex Skolnick of Testament asserted that he &quot;wrote some of the best riffs of all time&quot; and &quot;he impacted music in such a way that an entire genre will never be the same&quot;. According to Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Hanneman is &quot;one of the most underrated writers and underrated players that ever was&quot; while Slash of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver defined him &quot;the king of thrash/speed metal guitar&quot;.

===Lyrics and music===

Hanneman wrote the music for most of the band&#x27;s fan favorites, songs such as &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;, &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, &quot;War Ensemble&quot;, &quot;Postmortem&quot;, &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot; and &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, which have all become staples for live performance at Slayer shows. Hanneman&#x27;s favorite album was &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; and he enjoyed performing the songs &quot;Raining Blood&quot; and &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. He contributed lyrics and music to every Slayer album, having formed a music and lyric writing partnership with Araya, which sometimes overshadowed King&#x27;s creative input.

When writing new material, the band writes the music before the lyrics. Hanneman often composed riffs at his house, using a 24-track and a drum machine and then by gathering opinions from the other band members; King and Lombardo made suggestions of alterations. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and then figure out where the lyrics and solos go. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music is a &quot;free for all&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I&#x27;ll be more on a roll and I&#x27;ll have more stuff, same with Kerry – it&#x27;s whoever&#x27;s hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it&#x27;s good we use it, if not we don&#x27;t.&quot;

===Legacy===
Hanneman&#x27;s guitar work had a notable influence on heavy metal music and culture. Musicians such as Robb Flynn (Machine Head), Dino Cazares (Fear Factory, Divine Heresy), Mille Petrozza (Kreator), Andreas Kisser (Sepultura), Dan Lilker (Anthrax, Nuclear Assault), Eric Hoffman (Amon/Deicide), Trevor Peres (Obituary), Mark Morton (Lamb of God) and Kelly Shaefer (Atheist) cited him as an influence on their playing and songwriting. Jeff Walker said that &quot;Hanneman&#x27;s playing and riff writing and attitude has had a big impact on Carcass&quot;. Shavo Odadjian declared that &quot;without Jeff Hanneman, there would be no System of a Down&quot;.

<text>Faial Island (), also known as Fayal Island, is a Portuguese island of the Central Group or &quot;Grupo Central&quot; of the Azores, in the Atlantic Ocean. 

The Capelinhos Volcano is the westernmost point of the island and is considered the westernmost point of Europe other than the Monchique Islet. 

The largest town on the island is Horta with a population of approximately 15,000 inhabitants.

The nearby islands of Pico and São Jorge form an area commonly known as the &quot;Triângulo&quot; or &quot;Triangle&quot;. 

Faial Island has also been referred to as the Ilha Azul or &quot;Blue Island,&quot; a name derived from the writings of Portuguese poet Raul Brandão describing the large number of hydrangeas that bloom during the summer months:
== History ==

=== Early records ===
During the Middle Ages, the island of Faial appeared on the 1375 Catalan Atlas as Ilha da Ventura or Insula de La Ventura, meaning Venture Island. By 1427, islands in the middle of the Atlantic had been discovered by Portuguese navigators. During his first voyage of exploration (1451), the navigator Diogo de Teive explored the coast of Faial.

The humanist friar Gaspar Frutuoso recounted that the first explorers did not find an uninhabited island, and that a hermit, who had a small flock and lived in a cave in the interior, had occupied the land.

=== Settlement by the Flemish following Josse van Huerter (late 1400s) ===
By 1460, nautical charts referred to this island as Ilha de São Luis. Around this time, Valentim Fernandes da Morávia, a German intellectual and translator residing in Lisbon, gave the first account relating to the settlement of the island. He wrote that Friar Pedro, the queen&#x27;s confessor, traveled with the Infanta Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy, to Flanders, where he met and developed a friendship with the nobleman Josse van Huerter. During their conversations, D. Pedro talked to van Huerter about the islands and their deposits of silver and tin (which he assumed were the Ilhas Cassitérides, or in English, the &quot;Islands of Tin&quot;). Van Huerter convinced 15 other men of the profitability of a venture in the archipelago.

Around 1465, Huerter disembarked for the first time on Faial along the beach of Praia de Almofariz (now Praia do Almoxarife). The expedition remained in the area of Lomba dos Frades for about a year, until their supplies ran out. His compatriots were angered by the lack of the promised precious metals, and van Huerter quickly escaped to Flanders and the court of the Duchess of Burgundy.

In 1467, Huerter returned to Faial on a new expedition, supported by the Duchess, who &quot;ordered men and women of all conditions, as well as priests to convey their religious orders, in addition to ships loaded with furniture and utensils necessary for the land and construction of houses, and she sent them for two years, with everything they needed for subsistence&quot; (according to a caption made by the German geographer Martin Behaim on the Nuremberg Globe). Valentim Fernandes also noted that Isabella had ordered civil criminals to be deported to the island. Infante D. Fernando, the Duke of Viseu and Master of the Order of Christ, gave Van Huerter the title of Captain-Major of the island. Immediately, the new colonists faced challenges due to a lack of potable water. They moved their settlement to the adjacent valley (which continues to bear the name of &quot;Flamengos&quot;, the Portuguese term for &quot;Flemish&quot; or literally, &quot;Flemish people&quot;). Van Huerter constructed a small chapel, consecrated in the name of Santa Cruz (Holy Cross). He eventually returned temporarily to Lisbon, where he married Beatriz de Macedo, the governess of the Duke of Viseu. Still an apt negotiator, he returned to Faial promoting the settlement of the colony and his holdings. He convinced a second group of settlers, under the Flemish nobleman Willem van der Haegen (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) to bring his compatriots, their families, and support staff to the island in 1467.

The settlers concentrated in the area of Conceição and Porto Pim, creating the nuclei of the Vila de Orta (later the Vila de Horta), a name transliterated from the surname of Josse van Huerter. By 1490, this Flemish community numbered approximately 1,500 people and was joined by several families from the Alentejo, Moinho and other islands in the archipelago. The rapid growth of the island, in this phase, was the result of the cultivation of wheat, and the growth in the woad industry. It was some time later, when the island&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Fayal&quot;, due to a large number of Faya trees (&quot;Myrica faya&quot;). With the island&#x27;s improving economy, more Portuguese settled and rapidly the Flemish influence diminished. 

=== Iberian settlers face privateers (late 1500s) ===
In 1583, as part of the Spanish occupation of the Azores (which began with a landing party on Terceira), a Spanish fleet was sent to Faial. During the expeditionary assault, a body of armed men landed at Pasteleiro and engaged the defenders. Although reinforced by French troops, the garrison was unable to fend off the invaders. During the Iberian Union of Portugal and Spain, the island was frequently attacked by British and French pirates. Raiding parties from the Earl of Cumberland (George Clifford) and Earl of Essex (Robert Devereaux) attacked the defenseless populations between 1589 and 1597. This was partly due to the influx of Spaniards to the islands, as opportunities for Iberian businessmen improved. The privateers robbed the inhabitants and burned what they left behind, not differentiating between Portuguese and Spanish people or properties. To protect themselves, the Faialense built a large number of fortresses; in the 18th century, there were more than 20. Meanwhile, offshore from Faial, on 22/23 June 1594, in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Faial Island&quot; or the action of Faial, three ships of the Earl of Cumberland attacked the 2,000-ton Portuguese carrack Cinco Chagas, which historians believe to be the richest treasure ship ever to sail from the East Indies, firing and sinking the ship immediately off the island with all hands and all cargo lost. 

The Cabeço do Fogo Volcano erupted in 1672, leading to substantial emigration to Brazil.

=== Development of Horta as a transatlantic waypoint (1700s - mid 1900s) ===
In intervening years Horta became a stopover for Jesuit missionaries traveling to and from Brazil and Asia. The Jesuits constructed a college in Horta, as did the Carmelites and Franciscan Orders. In the 18th century, the explorer James Cook also reached the islands before initiating his Pacific voyages of discovery.

The people of Faial were active participants in the struggles between the Liberals and Absolutionists, finally deciding to favor the Liberals, and welcoming the visit of King Pedro IV in 1832. For its loyalty, Horta was elevated to the status of a town.
In 1876 work started on the construction of a dock in the protected harbor of Horta. As time progressed, Faial&#x27;s importance expanded through this dock, as a waypoint to trans-Atlantic traffic. Charles William Dabney, the American entrepreneur (17941871), was responsible for the growth of the industry of the islands with whaling, wine, and orange exports predominating. A philanthropic figure, Dabney was responsible for cultivating the economy of the island and supporting its population, aiding agriculture, and generating markets abroad for their goods. As well as owning the Fayal shipping line, he was US consul for the Azores 18261871; one of the three Dabneys who for many years held the post of American consul for the Azores. The growth of industry and trans-Atlantic sail traffic also expanded Horta&#x27;s importance, as a safe harbor and coal storage base. In 1919, the first airplane to cross the Atlantic stopped at Horta. Horta&#x27;s exceptional situation also led to Pan American establishing a Clipper base there. Similarly, British, American, French, German, and Italian intercontinental submarine cable stations were based in Horta. During World War Two, Horta was also an important naval base, giving shelter to some of the Allied ships that took part in the Normandy invasion.

=== Migration to the United States (1950s - 1970s) ===
The island, dependent on whaling and agriculture, remained prosperous until the eruption of Capelinhos volcano in 1957. Communities of the northern and western coasts were harshly affected by the eruption, as agricultural lands were untillable and covered with sand and ash. This led to the migration of 4,000 people to the United States, spearheaded by members of the Portuguese diaspora in New England and Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy. In addition, whaling, as a viable commercial enterprise was slowly curtailed with innovations in the chemical sector and the influence of animal-rights groups.

=== Autonomous Region of Portugal (1980s - 2000s) ===
Economic and political changes since the 1980s have helped to revitalize the island&#x27;s economy and development. After the Azores gained the status of an Autonomous Region within Portugal, Horta, the island&#x27;s only city, hosted the Regional Parliament (&quot;Parlamento Regional&quot;) of the Azores.

== Geography ==

=== Physical geography ===

Along with other islands in the Azores archipelago, the island of Faial is volcanic, being one of the most volcanically active islands of the archipelago, and is close to the tectonic rift between the European and North American Plates. The island can be considered (from a geophysical perspective) the westernmost point of Europe (the two islands west of Faial, Flores, and Corvo, are already on the American plate).

The island is shaped as an irregular pentagon that occupies an area of approximately , formed along a &quot;leaky&quot; transform fault extending from the mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Hirondelle faults. This is the same fault that bisects the remainder of the Central Group of islands along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation. Although formed by complex volcanological events, the current landmass is dominated by the crater of its central stratovolcano with relatively gently sloping flanks, showing little sign of major erosion.

The island was formed from several geomorphological structures resulting from volcanism and other tectonic forces:
* The nature of the stratovolcano structure results in an island that converges at the central Caldera Volcanic Complex, although the highest point occurs along the southern rim, at the peak of Cabeço Gordo (1,043-meter above sea level). The &quot;Caldeira&quot; (Caldera) is an almost circular 2000-meter perimeter, with a 400-meter depth below the summit of Cabeço Gordo (almost 570 m above sea level). Its center is broken by water marshes, thickets, and minor cinder cones, and surrounded by almost vertical cliffs with diverse vegetation, both endemic or invasive to Macaronesia. It is composed of pyroclastic material, pumitic projectiles, phreatic and phreatomagmatic deposits, and examples of pyroclastic flows and lahars.
* The Pedro Miguel Graben, located in the island&#x27;s northeast, is characterized by an extensive fault system, showing the remnants of the original Ribeirinha Central Volcano that formed the island. In the southeast, the Horta Platform is characterized by low-altitude projectiles and extensive lava flows. Several strombolian and surtseyan cones, such as Monte da Guia, cover the area occupied by the island&#x27;s main urban center.
* The Capelo Volcanic Complex is the most recent geomorphological feature, composed of a linear series of scoria cones, resulting from basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. On September 27, 1957, the last eruption took place along Costa da Nau and Ponta dos Capelinhos, near the small parish of Capelo. At first, a small &quot;Ilha Nova&quot; (new island) formed off the coast, quickly disappearing. During a subsequent eruption a cone and a small isthmus formed off the coast, and then volcanic activity dissipated. The volcano became active again on December 16, 1957; this lasted until May 12, 1958, and connected the islet with Faial, effectively enlarging the island by 2.4-km2 and extending the Ponta dos Capelinhos into the western ocean.

The mineral fayalite is named for this island, having been first identified and described there in 1840. It is an iron-rich expression within the olivine family.

===Climate===

Faial has a humid subtropical climate with some Mediterranean influences, oceanic at higher altitudes. Average temperature is around , at daytime and at nighttime. It has very mild winters for its latitude, in part due to its location in the mid-Atlantic Ocean and influence from the Gulf Stream, averaging in its coldest month, February, and frosts never occur other than at high altitude. For comparison, Ocean City, Maryland, at a similar latitude, is colder in its coldest month, averaging only . Summers are warm and relatively dry. Temperatures are moderated year-round, never too hot or too cold, daily temperatures are also moderated, with only difference between highs and lows. Average relative humidity remains high at around 80% and insolation is relatively low with around 1800–1900 hours of annual sunshine, similar to locations in coastal northwestern Europe such as Nantes, France, although the sun is stronger in Faial because of its lower latitude. Precipitation is plentiful especially in the winter months, averaging annually. At higher altitudes (e.g. Caldeira Volcano) temperatures are cooler, precipitation and humidity are increasingly higher, and fog is very common.

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===


In 2008, the Regional Government of the Azores established a comprehensive administrative framework to administer and promote the various environmental ecosystems of the island. These areas were reorganized under Regional Legislative Decree 46/2008/A, into the Faial Nature Park, that includes 13 protected areas:
;Nature Reserves
* [FAI01] Nature Reserve of the Caldeirinhas ()
* [FAI02] Nature Reserve of the Caldeira ()
* [FAI03] Nature Reserve of the Morro do Castelo Branco ()
;Protected Areas for the Management of Habitats and Coast Species
* [FAI04] Protected Area of Cabeço do Fogo ()
* [FAI05] Protected Area of Capelinhos, Northwest Coast and Varadouro ()
* [FAI06] Protected Area of Varadouro-Castelo Branco ()
* [FAI07] Protected Area of Lomba Grande ()
;Protected Landscapes
* [FAI08] Protected Landscape of Monte da Guia ()
* [FAI09] Protected Landscape of the Central Zone ()
;Protected Areas for the Management of Resources
* [FAI10] Protected Resource Area of the (Faial Sector) Faial-Pico Channel ()
* [FAI11] Protected Resource Area of Castelo Branco ()
* [FAI12] Protected Resource Area of Capelinhos ()
* [FAI13] Protected Resource Area of Cedros ()
In addition, there are a few instituted forest reserves on the island of Faial, under the authority of the &quot;Direcção Regional de Recursos Florestais&quot; (&quot;Regional Directorate for Forest Services&quot;):
* Forest Reserve of Capelo ()
* Forest Reserve of Cabouco Velho ()
* Recreational Forest Reserve of Falca ()
Other areas of geological or environmental interest:
* Anelares Grotto (), located along the southern road of the &quot;Ribeira da Lombega&quot;, in Castelo Branco, this is a geological formation produced from a lava tube near the mountainous coast: it extends 35.5 meters from Ribeira da Lombega, is 2.5 meters wide and is 3.7 meters at its highest point.

While diving in the Faial-Pico canal in 2013, the submarine Lula1000 discovered a coral reef in depth and covering an area of . In a communiqué to the Rebikoff–Niggeler Foundation, the group suggested that the reef formation was an important first discovery for the submarine team, which was located in the waters of the Azores since 1994, in order to document sea depth. Until this time, there were no documented records of coral reefs at such a depth in the waters of the Azores, nor at such a distance from Faial.

=== Human geography ===
Administratively, the island is governed as one municipality, with its government seat in the city of Horta. Operationally, there are thirteen civil parishes with their own assemblies, three of which (Angústias, Matriz, and Conceição) constitute the principal urbanized core:

* Angústias; urban parish that includes the escoria cones of Monte da Guia, Monte Escuro and Monte Carneiro, as well as the island&#x27;s hospital, the major hotels, the commercial and container port, and many historical buildings (such as the Fort of Santa Cruz, The Cedars, and the Church of Nossa Senhora das Angústias): 3,025 inhabitants (2003).
* Conceição; urbanized and rural parish connected to the city of Horta, with 1,157 inhabitants in 2001. It was one of the nuclei of the modern city of Horta, the location of the historic forts of Alagoa and Bom Jesus, and the location of the Courts building and Fayal Sport Club (and football field).
* Matriz; the urban heart of the city of Horta, with 2,523 inhabitants (2001); landmarks include the Horta Museum, Sociedade Recreativa Amor da Pátria, Império dos Nobres, the historic Clock Tower, the former Walter Bensaúde Hospital and the Horta Archive and the Public Library, as well as the location of the Municipal Government (Câmara Municipal da Horta).

The remainder of the parishes (except Flamengos) circle the island, all linked by the regional road network and its ancillary roads:
* Flamengos; one of the first nuclei of settlement and colonization, and the only interior/landlocked parish in the municipality of Horta founded by Flemish colonists and Portuguese settlers from the archipelago.
* Praia do Almoxarife; the beachhead of the early colonists to Faial, Almoxarife is a coastal parish on the east coast, located between Ponta da Espalamaca and Lomba dos Frades, and known for its black sand beach.
* Pedro Miguel; located on the eastern coast between Lomba dos Frades and Lomba Grande, its 723 inhabitants lost their primary place of worship, the Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, during the 1998 earthquake.
* Ribeirinha; nestled in the river valley of the Pedro Miguel Graben and existing along the fracture zone of the Ribeirinha Volcanic complex along the north-northeast coast, Riberinha has experienced many seismic events historically.
* Salão; the smallest parish by population situated on the northern coast of Faial, a community built by Spanish settlers who were later expelled following the end of the Iberian Union.
* Cedros; built on the coastal cliffs of the Cedros Plateau along the northern coast, it is the oldest parish on Faial; involved in agriculture and dairy industry (including the milk cooperative C.A.L.F).
* Praia do Norte; a zone of recent historical volcanism, built on layers of ash and pyroclastic deposits, the parish became &quot;extinct&quot; between 1672 and 1845 following the eruption of Cabeço do Fogo, which depopulated the parish. Emigration also occurred following the eruption of Capelinhos in 195758.
* Capelo; a parish built along a linear series of volcanic cones, including Capelinhos off the western coast; its eruption in 195758 led to the implementation of an immigration program spearheaded by Senator John F. Kennedy that reduced the population of Faial and Capelo.
* Castelo Branco; location of the international airport, its 1,115 inhabitants are involved in a mix of agricultural and enterprises associated with primary and secondary industries along the southern coast that includes the micro-climate of Varadouro.
* Feteira; a parish dominated by agriculture, the inhabitants are equally tied to the commercial activities in Horta, and have become a suburb of the larger city.

Numerous earthquakes and seismic events have impacted Faial throughout its populated history. The most important were the earthquakes and aftershocks that occurred around Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day in 17591760. Similar in nature was the 1926 earthquake that rumbled the city of Horta, in early-April, where damages were reported in Flamengos, Ribeirinha, and Conceição. Then, on August 31 at 8:42, a new earthquake caused eight deaths and destroyed buildings in Horta, as well as the parishes of Conceição, Praia do Almoxarife (ruining 220 homes), Flamengos, Feteira, and Castelo Branco, Salao, and most of the Lomba do Pilar. Approximately 4,138 homes and buildings were partially or totally damaged. The years 1957–1958 (Capelinhos eruption), 1963, and 1973 all experienced similar tremors and events. The 1998 Azores earthquake on July 9, which shook the islands of Faial, Pico, and São Jorge at 07:19 (its epicentre north-northeast of Faial), measured 5.6 on the Richter scale and caused damage to the parishes of Riberinha, Pedro Miguel, Salão, and Cedros, as well as more extensive damage in Castelo Branco (mainly Lombega), Flamengos, and Praia do Almoxarife. Eight people died in the earthquake, and 1,700 were left homeless.

== Economy ==
Faial&#x27;s early economic growth was propelled by the cultivation and processing of woad, a blue-coloured dye produced from the plant &quot;Isatis tinctoria.&quot; It was the only source for blue dye until the end of the 16th century, when Portuguese trade routes started bringing indigo from the Far East. Economic and population growth was also spearheaded by legends of tin and silver perpetuated by members of the Portuguese court.

The island economy experienced a degree of prosperity until 1957, when the Capelinhos Volcano erupted in the western part of the island, reactivating emigration to North America, encouraged by promises of aid made by Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy to the affected populations.

The main agricultural commodities of the island are potatoes, cereals, fruits, and wines, along with cattle (which make up its dairy and meat industry). The city of Horta is the centre of commerce and services on the island.

In the 1970s, after the Carnation Revolution, Portugal experienced economic growth, and an airport was opened; with it, tourists came. After Portugal entered into the European Economic Community (EEC), the standard of living rapidly grew and today the population is generally prosperous.

==Architecture==
Faial is a tourist destination with a rich collection of historical, natural, and modern attractions that bring yachts, cruise ships, tourist groups, and naturalists to the hills and towns of the island. Apart from several hotels and bed &amp; breakfasts scattered throughout the parishes, the visitor seeking sun will likely travel to the black sand beaches of Praia de Almoxarife, Conceição and Porto Pim, as well as the rock pools scattered along the coast. Varadouro is one such place, known for its warmer waters, micro-climate, summer cottages, and extensive salt-water pools open to the ocean.

===Civic===
* Termas do Varadouro (Thermal Spa of Varadouro)
* Geological Museum of the Volcano
* Interpretative Center of the Capelinhos Volcano (including the Capelinhos lighthouse)
* Escola de Artesanto do Capelo (School of Handicrafts)

===Military===
* Fort of Santa Cruz
* World War Two Artillery Batteries

===Religious===

* Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Esperança – ruined chapel on the grounds of the parochial church, Capelo
* Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo – located in Varadouro, Capelo
* Chapel of São Pedro – abandoned chapel to St. Peter, located in Feteira
* Church of Santa Catarina de Alexandria – situated in Castelo Branco
* Church of Santissima Trinidade (Holy Trinity) – located in Capelo
* Church of the Divino Espírito Santo – one of the oldest churches on the island, located in Feteira
* Church of Nossa Senhora das Dores - Praia do Norte

==Culture==

===Festivities===
Faial has a calendar that includes several secular and religious festivals. The most important ones occur in the summer. From Ascension Day until August, the feasts of the Holy Spirit are major events in each parish and neighborhood. During these events, a procession goes to the local church, a mass is celebrated there in conformity with a tradition/legend of Saint Elizabeth of Portugal, and then the procession returns to the local &quot;império&quot;, where a feast of meat broth and soup is served to the invited guests, and the same soup and &quot;massa sovada&quot; (sweet bread) is handed out as a traditional sign of penitence. On Faial, generally, these feasts are by invitation, whereas on other islands they are open to the public.

The patron saint of Faial is Saint John, celebrated as São João da Caldeira, on June 24. This is a day celebrated with a mass at the Chapel of São João, followed by family picnics along the roadways and fields of the Caldera. Similarly, in Largo Jaime Melo in Horta, people gather from around the island to enjoy picnics, and other diversions (such as band music and/or singers).

On August 1, people celebrate the annual feast of Nossa Senhora da Guia, a celebration originally started by local fisherman in the name of the Virgin Mary. A flotilla of small boats with one carrying the statue of the Virgin arrives in the harbor at Port Pim. From there, following benedictions, the statue is taken in procession to the top of Monte da Guia, where mass is celebrated in the chapel of Monte da Guia.

The most important festival of the Faialense calendar is the secular &quot;Semana do Mar&quot; (Sea Week). It is a week-long celebration in Horta of Faial&#x27;s link to the sea, celebrated in song, dance, exhibitions and kiosks selling different foods (of local and continental Portugal) and goods. During the day there are several sailing competitions and exhibits, while in the evening while many sample foods along the Avenida Marginal. Others listen and/or dance to popular and/or traditional musical acts on one of several platforms devoted to bands, traditional and modern/contemporary musical artists. The events culminate with a traditional closing ceremony and fireworks display.

===Tradition===
The island, like some other Azorean islands, produces cheeses and other milk products, along with beef, and by-products notable in Portugal. Its cuisine features local seafood.

Scrimshaw, handiwork made of whale teeth, is a traditional craft of the Azores. Other types of handiwork traditionally created on the island include straw embroideries on tulle, flowers made from fish scales, decorations in cut paper, as well as crochet lace-work with characteristic motifs .

<doc id="1163160" wikidata="Q3194318" url="?curid=1163160" title="DC++">
<text>DC++ is a free and open-source, peer-to-peer file-sharing client that can be used for connecting to the Direct Connect network or to the ADC protocol. It is developed primarily by Jacek Sieka, nicknamed arnetheduck.

== History and background ==
DC++ is a free and open-source alternative to the original client, NeoModus Direct Connect (NMDC); it connects to the same file-sharing network and supports the same file-sharing protocol. One of the reasons commonly attributed to the popularity of DC++ is that it has no adware of any kind, unlike NMDC.

Many other clients exist for the Direct Connect network, and most of these are DC++ &quot;mods&quot;: modified versions of DC++, based on DC++&#x27;s source code. A partial list of DC++ mods is given below. Some of these clients were developed for specialized communities (e.g. music-sharing communities), or in order to support specific experimental features, or perhaps features that have been rejected from inclusion in DC++ itself. An example of an experimental feature is hashing, which was initially implemented in BCDC++ and later adopted by DC++.

, DC++ had around 90% market share of the Direct Connect community.

== Forks ==
An advantage of the free and open-source nature of DC++ is that several mods have been released which add features to the original client.

Many users send patches to DC++ which are included in future releases, but some features are rejected by the developer. Stated reasons for rejecting a patch are because they are coded poorly, or that the feature is frivolous, abusable or overly specialized, and does not belong in the main client. Examples include: upload bandwidth limiting (many users feel that upload bandwidth limiting is a form of cheating, while other users not using a full-duplex network connection can only achieve reasonable download speeds by limiting uploads), colorized chat, specialized operator functions (e.g. client/share checking).

The developers of some forks contribute features and bug fixes back upstream to DC++.

<doc id="1163161" wikidata="Q326063" url="?curid=1163161" title="Leaves' Eyes">
<text>Leaves&#x27; Eyes is a symphonic metal band from Germany and Norway. Formed in 2003 by Liv Kristine, formerly the lead singer of Theatre of Tragedy, along with the entire line-up of Atrocity, the band has since released eight studio albums, a single, six EPs, one live album, and a DVD.

Most of Leaves&#x27; Eyes&#x27; lyrics, written by Liv Kristine until her departure in 2016, focus on Norse mythology and the Viking Age. The melodic vocals of Liv Kristine and her successor, Elina Siirala, are occasionally complemented by death growl vocals from Krull, a vocal style Kristine refers to as &quot;beauty and the beast&quot;.

== History ==
===&quot;Lovelorn&quot; (2003–2005)===
Leaves&#x27; Eyes have frequently incorporated naturalistic themes in their music since the release of their 2004 debut album, &quot;Lovelorn&quot;. Many of the lyrics on this album were inspired not only by nature but also by sagas and legends rooted in Norse mythology. The band was well received during their stage premiere at Wave Gotik Treffen 2004.

Each member of the band had significant professional experience in other musical projects prior to joining Leaves&#x27; Eyes, effectively making it a supergroup. Frontwoman Liv Kristine performed with the band Theatre of Tragedy from its formation in 1993 until her departure in 2003. This Norwegian band was among the first to feature a female voice in the metal scene, and their club hit &quot;Tanz der Schatten&quot; became emblematic of a distinctive musical genre. Additionally, Liv Kristine was active in the pop music scene, performing songs for TV hits such as &quot;Tatort&quot; and &quot;Schimanski&quot;. The other members of Leaves&#x27; Eyes come from the death metal band Atrocity.

===&quot;Vinland Saga&quot; (2005–2009)===
One year after &quot;Lovelorn,&quot; Leaves&#x27; Eyes released their follow-up album, &quot;Vinland Saga,&quot; in 2005, inspired by Viking explorer Leif Eriksson. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Elegy,&quot; charted in Germany for four consecutive weeks. The television station ProSieben featured &quot;Elegy&quot; as the official song for the TV series &quot;NUMB3RS&quot;.

In addition to their studio work, Leaves&#x27; Eyes tours extensively. Over four years, the band performed across four continents and 34 countries, playing a total of 222 concerts. Their live DVD, &quot;We Came with the Northern Winds: En Saga i Belgia,&quot; reached number 11 on the German DVD charts in 2009. This exclusive package documents the band&#x27;s history and includes footage of their 2007 concert at the &quot;Metal Female Voices Festival&quot;. This headline show featured elaborate staging, including a Viking longship on stage.

===&quot;Njord&quot; (2009–2011)===
&quot;Njord&quot; was released in 2009, continuing the band&#x27;s chart success. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;My Destiny,&quot; quickly became an anthem, following in the footsteps of &quot;Elegy&quot;. &quot;Njord&quot; received critical acclaim as &quot;an epic masterpiece.&quot; The album showcased a more modern style compared to previous releases and included symphonic metal tracks of heightened complexity, featuring the Lingua Mortis Orchestra conducted by Victor Smolski. Several lyrics were inspired by the English folk ballad &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;. The band&#x27;s live performances were equally successful across Europe and North America. For the Special Fan Edition of &quot;Njord,&quot; Leaves&#x27; Eyes recorded the &quot;At Heaven&#x27;s End&quot; EP in 2010.

===&quot;Meredead&quot; (2011–2013)===
One year later, Leaves&#x27; Eyes released their fourth studio album, &quot;Meredead&quot;. Produced by Alexander Krull, the album blends folk elements from earlier works to shape &quot;Meredead&quot;&#x27;s atmospheric tone. The opening track, &quot;Spirits&#x27; Masquerade,&quot; incorporates folk instrumentation, enriching the album’s diverse sound. Tracks like &quot;Étaín&quot; and &quot;Sigrlinn&quot; lyrically evoke the mysticism of ancient cultures, featuring uilleann pipes to enhance their thematic depth. The album also includes more traditional songs, such as &quot;Nystev&quot; and &quot;Kråkevisa&quot;; the latter employs the Scandinavian nyckelharpa, or keyed fiddle. A cover of &quot;To France&quot; reinterprets the tragedy and emotion of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s classic. Supporting vocals and instrumentation on the album are provided by Maite Itoiz and John Kelly (Elfenthal), Carmen Elise Espenæs (Midnattsol), the Norwegian Anette Guldbrandsen, and Victor Smolski&#x27;s Lingua Mortis Orchestra.

The 2011 EP &quot;Melusine&quot; was a special release in collaboration with the German magazine &quot;Sonic Seducer&quot;.

===&quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot; (2013–2015)===
In an interview with Valkyrian Music, Leaves&#x27; Eyes announced they had begun writing material for their fifth studio album, which they aimed to release in spring 2013. On January 7, 2013, the band announced on their official Facebook page that the title of their fifth studio album would be &quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot;.

On March 23, 2013, Leaves&#x27; Eyes further announced on Facebook that vocal recording had begun, accompanied by a statement:

At the moment Liv Kristine is tracking vocals for the upcoming Leaves&#x27; Eyes album: 
&quot;The recording sessions at Mastersound studios are so much fun, as well as being highly intense. 
Today I recorded an amazing and classically influenced new song. We are all very excited about the songs for the new album.&quot;

On May 9, 2013, the band announced that the vocal recordings were complete and that Alexander Krull had begun mixing the album:

Good news from Mastersound Studio: The vocal recordings for all songs on our upcoming release &quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot; have just been completed. Furthermore, Alex is already busy mixing the album. We have taken a significant inspirational step since the production of &quot;Meredead,&quot; both in terms of sound and vocals. It has been such a pleasure evolving in my singing techniques and knowledge, and I thank my band members for &quot;giving me an inspirational kick&quot; when I needed to gain momentum behind the microphone. &quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot; is hauntingly dreamlike and heavy to the core!
The band premiered the first new song from the album, titled &quot;Hell to the Heavens,&quot; at the Summer Breeze Festival.

The artwork for the new album was released on August 26, 2013. A few days later, the band released a video announcing that they would be performing at Metal Female Voices Fest 2013. A teaser of the studio version of &quot;Hell to the Heavens&quot; was also included in the video.

===&quot;King of Kings&quot; and departure of Liv Kristine (2015–2016)===
Leaves&#x27; Eyes stated in 2015 that they would release a new album titled &quot;King of Kings&quot;, which would feature the London Voices choir and guest vocals by Simone Simons of Epica. This album would also be their first release on AFM Records after parting ways with their longtime label, Napalm Records. &quot;King of Kings&quot; is a concept album centered around the sagas of Norway&#x27;s first king, Harald Fairhair (&quot;Harald Hårfagre&quot;).

In an interview with Sonic Cathedral webzine, Liv Kristine discussed her inspiration for the album:
The nicest thing for me is that it is said in the sagas that Harald became the first king of Norway after he won a battle that took place in one of the Norwegian fjords called Hafrsfjord. You know, that is a very important place—not only for the history of Norway—but also for me, because I was born there. So, this album is a concept album, but it&#x27;s also a very personal album. 

The first official video from &quot;King of Kings&quot; is for the track &quot;The Waking Eye,&quot; which was filmed in Norway (for the background scenes) and in Germany (for the action scenes). The Viking reenactment group Værjaborg supplied over 40 members for the battle and action sequences. Leaves&#x27; Eyes considers &quot;The Waking Eye&quot; to be their most ambitious video to date.

On April 15, 2016, the band announced they had parted ways with lead vocalist and co-founder Liv Kristine. Since then, both parties have provided different accounts of how the split occurred, with the band stating that the decision regarding Kristine&#x27;s departure was made in January. While the band initially stated that it had been a mutual decision, Kristine disputed this claim, indicating she was dismissed and that it was not her decision. Legal proceedings have since been initiated.

===Arrival of Elina Siirala and &quot;Sign of the Dragonhead&quot; (2016–2019)===
On April 15, 2016, the band announced Finnish singer Elina Siirala as their new lead vocalist. Siirala made her debut with the band on April 18, 2016, at the Hammersonic Festival in Jakarta. A tour edition of the album &quot;King of Kings&quot; was released on June 3, 2016.

On October 7, 2016, the band released the EP &quot;Fires in the North,&quot; which featured a brand new song as well as three re-recorded tracks from &quot;King of Kings&quot; with Siirala on vocals. Following the release of the EP, the band embarked on a North American tour in support of Sabaton. On November 27, 2017, the band announced their new album, &quot;Sign of the Dragonhead&quot;. The same day the album was announced, the title track was released as the lead single. The song &quot;Across the Sea&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on December 31, 2017, with an accompanying music video. The band released &quot;Jomsborg&quot; as the album&#x27;s third single on January 11, 2018.

&quot;Sign of the Dragonhead&quot; was released on January 12, 2018. The band toured throughout Europe in support of the album, and on August 30, 2018, they released the song &quot;Riders on the Wind&quot; as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single. The music video for the song featured footage from the &quot;Sign of the Dragonhead&quot; tour. On September 7, 2018, a tour edition of &quot;Sign of the Dragonhead&quot; was released, which included the &quot;Riders on the Wind&quot; physical single.

===&quot;The Last Viking&quot;, departure of Thorsten Bauer and &quot;Myths of Fate&quot; (2020–present)===
&quot;The Last Viking&quot; was released on October 23, 2020. The album continued the trend toward folk metal and historical lyrics. On May 23, 2021, the band announced the addition of bassist Andre Nasso. On December 29, 2021, it was announced that Thorsten Bauer would leave the band by the end of 2021.

On December 9, 2023, the band revealed the title of their ninth studio album, &quot;Myths of Fate&quot;, which was released on March 22, 2024.

<text>The McKenzie Pass–Santiam Pass Scenic Byway is an National Scenic Byway in the U.S. state of Oregon. The route is a loop designed to provide a tour of the high Cascade Range northwest of Bend, passing over both McKenzie Pass and Santiam Pass.

==Route description==
The route begins on its eastern end at the town of Sisters in northern Deschutes County. It follows Oregon Route 126 westward over Santiam Pass south of Three Fingered Jack, then south along the valley of the McKenzie River. It then follows Oregon Route 242 eastward over McKenzie Pass, north of the Three Sisters then back to the town of Sisters. The route is considered a summer tour route, since the road over McKenzie Pass is closed in winter due to snowfall.

==History==
The McKenzie Pass–Santiam Pass Scenic Byway was designated a National Forest Scenic Byway on February 8, 1989. It was later made an Oregon State Scenic Byway on February 19, 1997 before becoming a National Scenic Byway on June 9, 1998.

<doc id="1163167" wikidata="Q2106494" url="?curid=1163167" title="Powerset construction">
<text>In the theory of computation and automata theory, the powerset construction or subset construction is a standard method for converting a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) which recognizes the same formal language. It is important in theory because it establishes that NFAs, despite their additional flexibility, are unable to recognize any language that cannot be recognized by some DFA. It is also important in practice for converting easier-to-construct NFAs into more efficiently executable DFAs. However, if the NFA has &quot;n&quot; states, the resulting DFA may have up to 2&quot;n&quot; states, an exponentially larger number, which sometimes makes the construction impractical for large NFAs.

The construction, sometimes called the Rabin–Scott powerset construction (or subset construction) to distinguish it from similar constructions for other types of automata, was first published by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott in 1959.

==Intuition==
To simulate the operation of a DFA on a given input string, one needs to keep track of a single state at any time: the state that the automaton will reach after seeing a prefix of the input. In contrast, to simulate an NFA, one needs to keep track of a set of states: all of the states that the automaton could reach after seeing the same prefix of the input, according to the nondeterministic choices made by the automaton. If, after a certain prefix of the input, a set of states can be reached, then after the next input symbol the set of reachable states is a deterministic function of and . Therefore, the sets of reachable NFA states play the same role in the NFA simulation as single DFA states play in the DFA simulation, and in fact the sets of NFA states appearing in this simulation may be re-interpreted as being states of a DFA.

==Construction==
The powerset construction applies most directly to an NFA that does not allow state transformations without consuming input symbols (aka: &quot;ε-moves&quot;). Such an automaton may be defined as a 5-tuple , in which is the set of states, is the set of input symbols, is the transition function (mapping a state and an input symbol to a set of states), is the initial state, and is the set of accepting states. The corresponding DFA has states corresponding to subsets of . The initial state of the DFA is , the (one-element) set of initial states. The transition function of the DFA maps a state (representing a subset of ) and an input symbol to the set , the set of all states that can be reached by an -transition from a state in .
A state of the DFA is an accepting state if and only if at least one member of is an accepting state of the NFA.

In the simplest version of the powerset construction, the set of all states of the DFA is the powerset of , the set of all possible subsets of . However, many states of the resulting DFA may be useless as they may be unreachable from the initial state. An alternative version of the construction creates only the states that are actually reachable.

===NFA with ε-moves===
For an NFA with ε-moves (also called an ε-NFA), the construction must be modified to deal with these by computing the &quot;ε-closure&quot; of states: the set of all states reachable from some given state using only ε-moves. Van Noord recognizes three possible ways of incorporating this closure computation in the powerset construction:

# Compute the ε-closure of the entire automaton as a preprocessing step, producing an equivalent NFA without ε-moves, then apply the regular powerset construction. This version, also discussed by Hopcroft and Ullman, is straightforward to implement, but impractical for automata with large numbers of ε-moves, as commonly arise in natural language processing application.
# During the powerset computation, compute the ε-closure formula_1 of each state that is considered by the algorithm (and cache the result).
# During the powerset computation, compute the ε-closure formula_2 of each subset of states that is considered by the algorithm, and add its elements to .

===Multiple initial states===
If NFAs are defined to allow for multiple initial states, the initial state of the corresponding DFA is the set of all initial states of the NFA, or (if the NFA also has ε-moves) the set of all states reachable from initial states by ε-moves.

==Example==
The NFA below has four states; state 1 is initial, and states 3 and 4 are accepting. Its alphabet consists of the two symbols 0 and 1, and it has ε-moves. 
The initial state of the DFA constructed from this NFA is the set of all NFA states that are reachable from state 1 by ε-moves; that is, it is the set {1,2,3}.
A transition from {1,2,3} by input symbol 0 must follow either the arrow from state 1 to state 2, or the arrow from state 3 to state 4. Additionally, neither state 2 nor state 4 have outgoing ε-moves. Therefore, ({1,2,3},0) = {2,4}, and by the same reasoning the full DFA constructed from the NFA is as shown below.

As can be seen in this example, there are five states reachable from the start state of the DFA; the remaining 11 sets in the powerset of the set of NFA states are not reachable.

==Complexity==

Because the DFA states consist of sets of NFA states, an -state NFA may be converted to a DFA with at most states. For every , there exist -state NFAs such that every subset of states is reachable from the initial subset, so that the converted DFA has exactly states, giving Θ() worst-case time complexity. A simple example requiring nearly this many states is the language of strings over the alphabet {0,1} in which there are at least characters, the th from last of which is 1. It can be represented by an -state NFA, but it requires DFA states, one for each -character suffix of the input; cf. picture for .

==Applications==
Brzozowski&#x27;s algorithm for DFA minimization uses the powerset construction, twice. It converts the input DFA into an NFA for the reverse language, by reversing all its arrows and exchanging the roles of initial and accepting states, converts the NFA back into a DFA using the powerset construction, and then repeats its process. Its worst-case complexity is exponential, unlike some other known DFA minimization algorithms, but in many examples it performs more quickly than its worst-case complexity would suggest.

Safra&#x27;s construction, which converts a non-deterministic Büchi automaton with states into a deterministic Muller automaton or into a deterministic Rabin automaton with 2O( log ) states, uses the powerset construction as part of its machinery.

<text>The 1998 NBA draft took place on June 24, 1998, at General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This draft helped turn around four struggling franchises: the Dallas Mavericks, the Sacramento Kings, the Boston Celtics, and the Toronto Raptors.

The Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors were not able to win the NBA draft lottery; as they were expansion teams, they were not allowed to select first in this draft.

The Mavericks, despite having a talented nucleus of Jason Kidd, Jamal Mashburn and Jimmy Jackson in the mid-1990s, had not had a winning season since 1989-90, which was also the last time they made the playoffs. By the end of the 1997 season, all three players were traded and it was time to rebuild. With the sixth selection in 1998, they drafted Robert Traylor and quickly traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks for Dirk Nowitzki and Pat Garrity. They then traded Garrity in a package to the Phoenix Suns for Steve Nash. With Nash and Nowitzki, the Mavericks quickly went from a lottery team in the late 1990s to a perennial playoff contender throughout the 2000s. Nowitzki went on to win the 2011 NBA Finals with Dallas without Nash, but with Kidd.

Meanwhile, the Raptors were a recent expansion team that had failed to win more than 30 games in its first three seasons. With the fourth pick they selected Antawn Jamison, whom they quickly dealt to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter. Carter went on to win Rookie of the Year.

First overall pick Michael Olowokandi from mid-major University of the Pacific is regarded by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. As of February 2019, he is the last top selection to come out of a university that is considered mid-major.

Five players from the 1998 draft class played in the NBA All-Star Game at least once in their careers: Nowitzki, Carter, Jamison, Paul Pierce and Rashard Lewis. All of them except Lewis scored at least 20,000 career points.

Carter retired in 2020, making him the last active player drafted in the 1990s to retire. He set the record for most seasons played in the NBA with 22, becoming the first player to ever appear in NBA games in four different decades. Nowitzki missed the same four-decade status by nine months, retiring from the Mavericks in April 2019 as the first player to ever spend more than 20 NBA seasons with one team.

==Draft selections==


==Notable undrafted players==


These players eligible for the 1998 NBA Draft were not selected but played at least one game in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
Much like last year, this year initially saw 40 total players classified as underclassmen entering the NBA draft. However, seven players from this year&#x27;s draft would later withdraw their names from entry, with Bud Eley from Southeast Missouri State University, Rico Harris from Los Angeles City College, the Yugoslavian-Greek born Marko Jarić from the Peristeri B.C. of Greece, the Bosnian-Greek born Saša Marković-Theodorakis from the Panionios B.C. in Athens, Greece, Lee Nailon from Texas Christian University, Lamar Odom from the University of Rhode Island, and the Greek born Dimitrios Papanikolaou from the Olympiacos Piraeus B.C. in Greece all withdrawing their entries into this year&#x27;s draft. Including four different players that came directly from high school into the NBA draft (three of which actually became drafted) and three overseas players that successfully stayed into the NBA draft, the number of underclassmen would jump up from 26 total college players to 33 overall. Regardless, the following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Rafer Alston – G, Fresno State (junior)
* Corey Benjamin – G, Oregon State (sophomore)
* Mike Bibby – G, Arizona (sophomore)
* Chandar Bingham – F, Virginia Union (sophomore)
* Marcus Bullard – G, Auburn Montgomery (junior)
* Vince Carter – F/G, North Carolina (junior)
* Wayne Clark – G, Park (freshman)
* Tim Cole – G, Northeast Mississippi CC (sophomore)
* Peter Cornell – C, Loyola Marymount (junior)
* Arthur Davis – G, St. Joseph&#x27;s (sophomore)
* Ricky Davis – F/G, Iowa (freshman)
* Tremaine Fowlkes – F, Fresno State (junior)
* Larry Hughes – G, Saint Louis (freshman)
* Randell Jackson – F, Florida State (junior)
* Jerome James – C, Florida A&amp;M (junior)
* Antawn Jamison – F, North Carolina (junior)
* Tyronn Lue – G, Nebraska (junior)
* Jelani McCoy – F/C, UCLA (junior)
* Mark Miller – G, UIC (junior)
* Nazr Mohammed – F/C, Kentucky (junior)
* Paul Pierce – G/F, Kansas (junior)
* Adam Roberts – G, San Francisco State (junior)
* James Spears – F, Shaw (junior)
* Robert Traylor – F, Michigan (junior)
* Winfred Walton – F, Fresno State (sophomore)
* Jason Williams – G, Florida (sophomore)
===High school players===
Had Lamar Odom declared entry into this year&#x27;s draft like he planned on doing, he would not have represented St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut due to him already declaring entry into college this year, but having academic troubles to qualify for collegiate play. That being said, this would be the fourth year in a row where at least one high school player would declare entry into the NBA draft after previously only doing it back in 1975. The following high school players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Al Harrington – F, St. Patrick (Elizabeth, New Jersey)
* Rashard Lewis – F, Alief Elsik HS (Houston, Texas)
* Ellis Richardson – G, Polytechnic (Los Angeles, California)
* Korleone Young – F, Hargrave Military Academy (Chatham, Virginia)
===International players===
In addition to the players below, three more players from Greece initially declared entry for this year&#x27;s draft, but ultimately withdrew their names for one reason or another. The following international players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Slava Medvedenko – F, Budivelnyk Kiev (Ukraine)
* Dirk Nowitzki – F, DJK Würzburg (Germany)
* Bruno Šundov – C, Split (Croatia)

<text>LAX is an American drama television series set at the Los Angeles International Airport, drawing its name from the airport&#x27;s IATA airport code, &quot;LAX&quot;. The series premiered on September 13, 2004 on NBC, and aired through April 16, 2005.

==Overview==
&quot;LAX&quot; is a drama focusing on the day-to-day operations of the airport, with its runway manager, Harley Random (Heather Locklear), and its terminal manager, Roger de Souza (Blair Underwood). In the final episode, Harley leaves her job at LAX after she is told by Roger that he wants stability back in his life and no longer wants to be romantically involved with her.

&quot;LAX&quot; premiered on NBC on September 13, 2004. Ten episodes aired before NBC announced in November 2004 that no further episodes would be produced. The show was moved to Saturdays at 8pm ET and the final episode aired on April 16, 2005. Thirteen episodes total were aired.

==Episodes==
==Production==
LAX (originally titled &quot;HUB&quot;, and then &quot;The Hub&quot;) was announced on NBC&#x27;s development slate on December 19, 2003, after being scrapped by NBC during the previous development season in winter 2003. On January 14, NBC greenlighted production on the pilot. Anthony and Joe Russo signed on as directors of the pilot on February 6. On May 17, 2004 NBC announced that they had picked up the pilot to series. This show was not renewed for a second season.

Exterior shots for the pilot episode were filmed in Texas, although sources differ on whether Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport or Fort Worth Alliance Airport stood in for Los Angeles International. Many other scenes were filmed using a vacant terminal and a disused Boeing 727 at Ontario International Airport, interspersed with establishing shots of the real LAX airport.

The theme song for the show was the beginning of &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; by Electric Light Orchestra. For the opening sequence of the final episode, a different excerpt of the song was used.

==Broadcast==
&quot;LAX&quot; premiered on September 13, 2004 and ended on April 16, 2005 on NBC.

==Reception==
In a survey by Philips, &quot;LAX&quot; got 17% of the votes for most anticipated new series.

The show was frequently the butt of comedic jokes due to its poor ratings, including Jay Leno, who remarked the show was &quot;so bad that the actual Los Angeles Airport is thinking of changing its name to avoid being associated with the show.&quot; The 13 episodes of the program averaged 6.52 million viewers.

&quot;LAX&quot; lost 19.09% of the viewers in its time slot versus the previous season, which was occupied by &quot;Third Watch&quot;.

<text>McKenzie Pass, elevation , is a mountain pass in the Cascade Range in central Oregon in the United States.

It is located at the border of Linn and Deschutes counties, approximately northwest of Bend, between the Three Sisters to the south and Mount Washington to the north. Oregon Route 242 goes over the pass.
At the summit of the pass, Oregon Route 242 crosses a lava flow just west of Sisters. Surrounded by lava, the Dee Wright Observatory was constructed in 1935 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers and named after their foreman. Visitors climb to the observatory to view the Cascade peaks visible from McKenzie Pass. Also near the summit is Clear Lake, a renowned location for fresh-water diving.

Highway 242 is not recommended for large trucks, trailers or motor homes due to numerous tight switchbacks. The pass is closed from November to July due to snow.

The pass is named for Donald McKenzie, a Scottish Canadian fur trader who explored parts of the Pacific Northwest for the Pacific Fur Company in the early 19th century.

==Astronaut training==
Parts of central Oregon were used as a training grounds for Apollo astronauts between 1964 and 1966. The astronauts would practice walking on terrain that was similar to the surface of the Moon. On August 25, 1964, Walter Cunningham struggled in a lava flow at McKenzie Pass, where he eventually fell and tore his space suit. Cunningham flew on Apollo 7 in 1968.

<doc id="1163213" wikidata="Q7420405" url="?curid=1163213" title="Santiam Pass">
<text>Santiam Pass is a mountain pass in the Cascade Range in central Oregon in the United States. It is located on the border between Linn and Jefferson counties, about northwest of Sisters, between the prominent volcanic horns of Three Fingered Jack to the north and Mount Washington to the south. Several other smaller volcanoes, including cinder cones and tuyas, are found near the summit of the pass. U.S. Route 20 connects eastern Oregon with the valley of the Santiam River on the west via Santiam Pass. One of the 19 or 20 lakes by the name of Lost Lake is located beside the highway just west of Santiam Pass. The pass may be approached from the west by three distinct routes:
* Oregon Route 22, also known as the North Santiam Highway, proceeds southeast from Salem and follows the North Santiam River to Santiam Junction.
* U.S. Route 20, which follows the South Santiam River from the Albany–Corvallis area to Santiam Junction.
* Oregon Route 126, which follows the McKenzie River northeast from Eugene.

From the east, Santiam Pass is approached from the town of Sisters; however, immediately east of Sisters, U. S. Highway 20 and Oregon Route 126, which share the route over the pass, split with Oregon Route 126 going northeast to Redmond and Prineville, Oregon and U. S. Route 20 heading southeast to Bend.

==History==
While the pass was known by native peoples, the first recorded crossing of the pass was in April 1859 by an expedition searching for a cattle trail over the Cascade Range from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon. This expedition was led by Andrew Wiley, who reportedly climbed a tall tree on a mountain near Lost Prairie to help determine the route. Lost Prairie is located along Hackleman Creek between Fish Lake and Tombstone Prairie. Wiley later helped establish the Santiam Wagon Road.

Originally known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who designated this crossing for his proposed railroad, Santiam Pass was renamed in 1929 when the Santiam Highway was completed. The original Santiam Pass is located three miles south and was discovered in 1859.

==Climate==

Santiam Pass has a subarctic climate with cold, extremely snowy winters and mild to sometimes warm summers with occasional precipitation. While it is subarctic, the average winter temperatures hover around the upper 20s. Part of this is due to its latitudal location and being only over 4000 feet in elevation, but it is also due to the significant amount of winter snow that can moderate the temperatures. Temperatures can, however, still reach the negatives a couple days per year and single digits for a good number of days, usually dry. Santiam Pass&#x27;s crest location allows for some of the highest snowfall totals in the US to fall onto it and for more summer rainfall than the surrounding lower elevated areas may see as well.

<text>Italian Folktales (&quot;Fiabe italiane&quot;) is a collection of 200 Italian folktales published in 1956 by Italo Calvino. Calvino began the project in 1954, influenced by Vladimir Propp&#x27;s &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot;; his intention was to emulate the Straparola in producing a popular collection of Italian fairy tales for the general reader. He did not compile tales from listeners, but made extensive use of the existing work of folklorists; he noted the source of each individual tale, but warned that was merely the version he used.

He included extensive notes on his alterations to make the tales more readable and the logic of his selections, such as renaming the heroine of &quot;The Little Girl Sold with the Pears&quot; Perina rather than Margheritina to connect to the pears, and selecting &quot;Bella Venezia&quot; as the Italian variant of &quot;Snow White&quot; because it featured robbers, rather than the variants containing dwarfs, which he suspected were imported from Germany.

It was first translated into English in 1962; a further translation is by Sylvia Mulcahy (Dent, 1975) and constituted the first comprehensive collection of Italian folktales.

== Reception ==
Reviewing the book in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote: &quot;Essentially this book is to Italian literature what the Grimms&#x27; collection is to German literature. It is both the first and the standard. And its particular glory is that it was done not by a scholar-specialist but by a great writer of fiction... With absolute sureness of touch he selected, combined, rewove, reshaped so that each tale and the entire collection would show at its best, clear and strong, without obscurity or repetition. It was, of course, both his privilege and his responsibility as a teller of tales to do so. He assumed his privilege without question, and fulfilled his responsibility magnificently. One of the best storytellers alive telling us some of the best stories in the world—what luck!&quot;

<doc id="1163236" wikidata="Q1034530" url="?curid=1163236" title="Capelinhos">
<text>The Capelinhos (from diminutive, which literally means &quot;little cape&quot;) is a monogenetic volcano located on the western coast of Faial Island in the Azores. It is part of the larger volcanic complex of Capelo, which includes 20 scoria cones and lava fields that are aligned west-northwest to east-southeast from the Caldeira Volcano caldera. Although the name &quot;Capelinhos&quot; is associated with the volcano, it technically refers to the western cape of the parish of Capelo. It can be considered the westernmost point of Europe; there are more westerly islands in the Azores archipelago but they lie on the North American Plate.

A volcanic eruption lasted for 13 months, from September 27, 1957 until October 24, 1958, which may have been two overlapping volcanic eruptions. While enlarging the land by 2.4 km2, it spawned 300 seismic events, hurled ash 1 km, destroyed 300 houses in the parishes of Capelo and Praia do Norte and caused the evacuation of 2,000 people (emigration to the US and Canada). On October 25, the volcano entered a period of dormancy. It is a part of an active fissural volcanic complex which creates multiple seismic and volcanic events.

==Geography and ecology==
Capelinhos is located along the Capelo Volcanic Complex, that comprises a western area of fissural volcanism and historical eruptions leading away from the Cabeço do Fogo. The events that began in 1957 were an extension of the volcanic activity that abruptly ended at Costado da Nau, the escarpment at Ponta dos Capelinhos. Similar to the Horta Platform, the peninsula is consistent with the shapes and products resulting from Surtseyan, Strombolian and Hawaiian volcanic types. The formation is composed primarily of basaltic rocks, although, less frequently, Hawaiian hawaiitic rocks are observed.

Capelinhos is classified a Surtseyan eruption, since it was formed in the relatively shallow coast of the Faial seamount. However, , a volcanologist and full professor at the University of the Azores, defends that the type of eruption should have been designated as &quot;Capelinian&quot; as it pre-dates the eruption of Surtsey by five years and was studied both by Portuguese and foreign scientists.

Located at Cabeço Norte, a volcanic vent releases water vapour with temperatures between 180 °C and 200 °C from the volcano complex.

The geographer Christophe Neff is carrying field studies on the pioneer vegetation in the Capelinhos area since 1999. In a recently published paper in “Finisterra” he wrote in the English abstract of the paper “Fifty years after the Capelinhos eruption we cannot find any tree or bushes on the volcano.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of its importance in enhancing understanding of submarine volcanoes, Capelhinos was included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

==History==

The Capelinhos eruption represented the first time that a submarine eruption was documented from beginning to end. Its location near an inhabited island with good communications meant it could be intensively studied. The first activities during the eruption were identified by engineer Frederico Machado, the Director of the District Public Works Department, his assistant engineer João do Nascimento and surveyor António Denis, under the authorization of the Civil Governor, Freitas Pimentel. The Director of the Observatory in Angra, Lieutenant-Colonel José Agostinho overflew the area, and Bernado Almada (at the Prince Albert of Monaco Observatory, in Horta) sent several bulletins relating the increased seismic activity of the area.

Between September 16 and 27, 1957, 200 earthquakes of intensity V (&quot;Moderate&quot;) on the Mercalli scale were registered. On September 23, the ocean waters off the coast of Ponte dos Capelinhos began to boil, and the first vapours were witnessed around 6:30 a.m. one kilometre northwest of the lighthouse. A constant tremor could be sensed, at times reaching a Level IV on the Mercalli scale (MM-31). Three days later, the activity increased; black ash (to about 1400 m) and water vapour (to about 4000 m) rose west of the two &quot;ilhéus&quot; () off the coast. On September 27, beginning at about 6:45 in the morning, a submarine eruption, 300 m from Ponta dos Capelinhos (100 m from the &quot;Ilhéus dos Capelinhos&quot;) began. Whale spotters at Costado da Nau, a few meters above the Capelinhos lighthouse, saw the ocean churning to the west and alerted the lighthouse keepers. On October 5: &quot;...the clouds of clay likely rose about one kilometre in height and solid fragments...reaching an area of 1200 metres around...&quot; The buildings in the area began to experience the first damages: windows were broken, tiles fell from the roofs. By the next day, the first ash-fall began on land; &quot;in a few hours a black mat covered the extreme West of island...&quot;, reaching 2.5 kilometres from the crater, necessitating the evacuation of the settlements of Norte Pequeno and Canto. Initially, gases and pyroclastic explosions persisted until October 13, while gradually diminishing, but were rapidly replaced by violent explosions, lava bombs, ash and lava streaming into the sea. This intense eruption occurred until the end of October with constant ash raining on Faial, destroying cultural lands, inhibiting normal farming and forcing the residents from local villages to evacuate. 
By October 10, the eruption had initially formed a small island, baptized &quot;Ilha Nova&quot; (), &quot;Ilha dos Capelinhos&quot; () or &quot;Ilha do Espírito Santo&quot; () by the locals, 600 meter diameter and 30 meter height with an open crater to the sea. By October 29, the island grew to 99 meters high and 800 meters in diameter of coarse black ash.

By the end of the first phase of the eruption, three reporters, Carlos Tudela and Vasco Hogan Teves from public television Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP), journalist Urbano Carrasco (from the newspaper &quot;Diário Popular&quot;) and boat pilot Carlos Raulino Peixoto risked their lives by traveling to the &quot;Ilha Nova&quot;. Arriving on the island, they planted a Portuguese flag, before hurriedly leaving. The &quot;New Island&quot; had disappeared into the sea by 30 October.

On November 4, 1957 a second volcanic event occurred rapidly, forming a second island, and by 12 November 1957 an isthmus had formed linking it with Faial. Explosions and ejecta increased progressively, reaching a climax by 15 December when a second cone was formed. Following a night of torrential rains and ash (on or about 16 November) the explosive activity ceased, and an effusive lava phase began with more ash and explosive rock. By then the largest eruptive column had reached 1450 metres into the air, carrying with it ash from the northwest for a distance of 20 kilometres (6 December). A final pause began on 29 December.

Between January and April 1958, new showers of ash and accompanying water vapour (both white and darkened) persisted, and the two &quot;Ilhéus&quot; off the coast of Ponte dos Capelinhos had disappeared under the sand and ash. During this period the cinder cone and isthmus became an integral part of the island of Faial, destroying the roofs of the local buildings and infilling the space to the lighthouse. From May 12–18, 450 seismic events were recorded as the volcano moved into a Strombolian phase, emitting projectiles 500 m into the air, causing moderate explosions and accompanied by infra-sonic waves that shook doors and windows on the island and some adjacent islands. This final phase lasted several months: the last lava currents were visible on 21 October, and the last projectiles were reported on 24 October. During this final stage (around 14 May), fumaroles were discovered inside Faial&#x27;s caldera, that began emitting sulfurous water vapor, boiling clay and mud.

Although one person nearly fell into the Capelinhos crater, there were no deaths from the eruption; generally, ash deposits and some projectiles caused the destruction of homes and the blanketing of agricultural lands in the parishes of Capelo and Praia do Norte. A report presented on 15 January 1958 indicated that 164 families had been affected by the eruption.

Due to the close relationship between Portugal and the United States, refugees from the beleaguered parishes emigrated. The Azorean Refugee Act (September 2, 1958), authorized the emigration of 1,500 people and was sponsored by Democratic Congressmen John O. Pastore of Rhode Island, and a young Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In addition to many families from the area of Capelo, other citizens of the Azores benefited from these temporary measures. This resulted in a 50% decrease of the resident population of Capelo, and contributed to an increased standard of living, greater working opportunities and some improvements in base incomes.

==Tourism==

The volcano is a landmark on Faial; its ruined lighthouse and Visitors Center (which lies along the cliff from the volcano) is a tourist destination. A trail network runs from the Visitors Center and lighthouse to the caldera summit. On September 27, 2007, commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of the eruption and its effects on the island&#x27;s history and people were broadcast in Portugal and throughout the Azorean diaspora.

<doc id="1163240" wikidata="Q935053" url="?curid=1163240" title="Harihara">
<text>Harihara (Sanskrit: हरिहर) is the dual representation of the Hindu deities Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara). Harihara is also known as Shankaranarayana (&quot;Shankara&quot; is Shiva, and &quot;Narayana&quot; is Vishnu).

Harihara is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality, known as Brahman. This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and &quot;oneness of all existence&quot; is discussed as Harihara in the texts of Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy.

Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara, with one half of the image as Vishnu and other half as Shiva, are found in the surviving cave temples of India, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century Badami cave temples.

==Concept==

The diversity within Hinduism encourages a wide variety of beliefs and traditions, of which two important and large traditions are associated with Vishnu and Shiva. Some schools focus on Vishnu (including his associated avatars such as Rama and Krishna) as the Supreme God, and others on Shiva (including his different avatars such as Mahadeva and Pashupata). The Puranas and various Hindu traditions treat both Shiva and Vishnu as being different aspects of the one Brahman. Harihara is a symbolic representation of this idea. A similar idea, called Ardhanarishvara or &quot;Naranari&quot;, fuses masculine and feminine deities as one and equivalent representation in Hinduism.

Depending on which scriptures (and translations) are quoted, evidence is available to support each of the different arguments. In most cases, even if one personality is taken as being superior over the other, much respect is still offered to both Vishnu and Shiva by the other&#x27;s worshippers (i.e. Shiva is still regarded as being above the level of an ordinary jiva and &#x27;the greatest of the Vaishnavas&#x27; by Vaishnavas who worship only Vishnu).

Swaminarayan holds that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God. 

== Legends ==
The earliest mention of Harihara is likely to be observed in the Vishnu Parva of the &quot;Harivamsha&quot;, where Markandeya discusses the being.

According to one legend, when Vishnu appeared as the enchantress Mohini in front of Shiva, the latter grew besotted with her and attempted to embrace her. At this moment, Mohini reverted to the true form of Vishnu, at which point the two deities fused as one being, Harihara. 

According to the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, the devotees of Shiva engaged in a dispute with Vishnu&#x27;s devotees regarding the supremacy of their deities. To end this issue, Shiva and Vishnu merged into one being, Harihara.
==Depictions==
Harihara is depicted in art as split down the middle, one half representing Shiva, the other half representing Vishnu. The Shiva half will have the matted locks of a yogic master piled high on his head and sometimes will wear a tiger skin, reserved for the most revered ascetics. Shiva&#x27;s pale skin may be read as ash-covered in his role as an ascetic. The Vishnu half will wear a tall crown and other jewelry, representing his responsibility for maintaining world order. Vishnu&#x27;s black skin represents holiness. Broadly, these distinctions serve to represent the duality of humble religious influence in the ascetic and authoritative secular power in the king or householder. However, in other aspects Shiva also takes on the authoritative position of householder, a position which is directly at odds with the ascetic position depicted in his Harihara manifestation.

Harihara has been part of temple iconography throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, with some illustrations listed in the following table. In some states, the concept of Harihara appears through alternate names and its progeny.

<text>Karl Paranya (born June 27, 1975) was the first NCAA Division III track and field athlete to break 4 minutes for the mile. He did this in the spring of 1997, running 3:57.6 on Haverford College&#x27;s outdoor track. Marcus O&#x27;Sullivan, one of three men ever to run over 100 sub-4 minute miles, paced Paranya in this record breaking run See the race on youtube.

==Early life==
Karl Paranya is from Unadilla, New York.

==Record for men&#x27;s 4x800 relay==
On February 6, 2000, at the Boston Indoor Games, Paranya, along with Joey Woody, Rich Kenah and David Krummenacker set a current Indoor World Record in the men&#x27;s 4x800-meter relay, posting a time of 7:13.94. This record cut nearly four seconds off the previous mark, held by the Soviet Union for nearly thirty years. At the date this addendum was written, Paranya&#x27;s best time in the mile was 3:54.83 posted on May 30, 1999, in Eugene Oregon, the 225th fastest mile in history.

==Olympics==
He ran in the 1996 and 2000 United States Olympic Trials (track and field).

<doc id="1163249" wikidata="Q1767418" url="?curid=1163249" title="The Early Beatles">
<text>The Early Beatles is the Beatles&#x27; sixth album released on Capitol Records, and their eighth album overall for the American market. All eleven tracks on this album were previously issued on the Vee-Jay Records release &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;, released in January, 1964. The front cover photo for this album features the same back cover photo for the British LP &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;.

The album is included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

==Background==
Vee-Jay Records had gained American distribution rights to the tracks on this album before the group became popular in America (because Capitol Records, the US subsidiary of EMI which owned the Beatles&#x27; record label Parlophone, had declined to release the group&#x27;s records in America), and their releases had initially failed to chart. But after the group became famous, Vee-Jay, still holding the rights to the early material, was able to reissue them in America and this time the records sold in the millions. Capitol filed a lawsuit attempting to stop Vee Jay from distributing the tracks, but was unsuccessful. In October 1964, Vee-Jay&#x27;s license to distribute the Beatles recordings it possessed expired, thus giving Capitol the distribution rights for the tracks on the album.

==Release and reception==
Although Vee-Jay (and subsidiary, Tollie Records) had compiled four albums, ten singles and one EP in the space of just fifteen months from these Beatles tracks, when issued by Capitol, &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; sold well, but its highest position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart was only number 43, making it the only original Beatles album issued by Capitol or United Artists Records not to reach numbers 1 or 2 in America (with the exception of the Capitol documentary album, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story,&quot; which peaked at number 7). Capitol did little to promote &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; since the label merely viewed it as a replacement for &quot;Introducing...The Beatles&quot;, rather than a &quot;new&quot; Beatles album. &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; was certified Gold ($1 million in sales) on 8 January 1974 and Platinum (1 million copies sold) on 10 January 1997 by the RIAA. The album was released in both mono and stereo versions. As no stereo masters of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; exist, Capitol used duophonic mixes of both songs. The mono pressing of the album was made with a two-to-one fold-down of the stereo tapes, as evidenced by John and Paul&#x27;s vocal collision and chuckle heard in the third verse of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. The original mix on the UK mono issue of the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album uses an edit to correct the mistake, while the stereo version of the same album does not. So the existence of the vocal error in a mono mix is unique to &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; as well as a short-lived Capitol Starline 45 rpm single released in October, 1965 and deleted only two months later.

===Compact disc===
&quot;The Early Beatles&quot; is available on compact disc as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 2&quot; boxed set (catalogue number CDP 0946 3 57498 2 3), in both its original stereo and mono fold-down Capitol mixes. In 2014, a second CD version of &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; containing the 2009 remastered UK stereo and mono mixes, was issued individually and as part of the Beatles &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot; boxed set.

<text>K-9 is a 1989 American buddy cop action comedy film starring Jim Belushi and Mel Harris. It was directed by Rod Daniel, written by Steven Siegel and Scott Myers, produced by Lawrence Gordon and Charles Gordon, and released by Universal Pictures.

Belushi plays bad-tempered San Diego police detective Michael Dooley, who has been tagged for execution by a major international drug dealer named Ken Lyman (played by Kevin Tighe). To help, K-9 Sergeant Brannigan (played by Ed O&#x27;Neill) gives Dooley an unorthodox drug-sniffing police dog called &quot;Jerry Lee&quot; (named after rock-and-roll singer Jerry Lee Lewis). The duo attempt to put Lyman behind bars but Dooley quickly learns Jerry Lee is a mischievous smart aleck who works only when and how he wants to. Many of the film&#x27;s gags revolve around Jerry Lee&#x27;s playfully destructive episodes.

The film was followed by a &quot;K-9&quot; film series, including two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;K-911&quot; (1999) and &quot;K-9: P.I.&quot; (2002); as well as a television spin-off film titled &quot;K-9000&quot;, that was intended to be the pilot episode to a TV series that was not ordered.

==Plot==

San Diego Police Detective Michael Dooley leaves his unmarked police car during a nightly stakeout to contact his girlfriend, Tracy, when a helicopter suddenly attacks and destroys the car. At the police station, Dooley confides with his lieutenant, Byers, the attack was likely ordered by Ken Lyman, the drug lord Dooley has been after for two years, but Dooley still insists in working alone, in spite of Byers’ attempts to get him a partner.

Following a tip regarding an informant, Freddie, he spends the night in his personal car. The next morning, Dooley coerces Freddie into revealing that Lyman did order the attack and giving a tip about a warehouse where Lyman’s drugs are, but its large size makes it impossible to find it. After helping out in a tricky drugs bust, Dooley asks his colleague Brannigan to loan him a K-9 to track down the drugs. Brannigan gets Dooley a grouchy veteran German Shepherd named Jerry Lee, capable of tracking down any drugs in a minute.

Dooley and Jerry Lee head to the warehouse where the search is unsuccessful - Jerry Lee initially ignores Dooley&#x27;s orders, prompting mockery out of the workers, and only a marijuana joint is found when commanded. However, at a pub where Dooley stakes out an intermediary, Benny the Mule, Jerry Lee saves Dooley when his cover is blown. With the dog&#x27;s help, Dooley subdues Benny and learns the location of Lyman&#x27;s next shipment, estimated in 50 million dollars. Meanwhile, Lyman kills Freddie and demands his henchman Dillon kill Dooley before the shipment arrives.

At Dooley&#x27;s apartment, Jerry Lee steals the spotlight after Tracy accepts Dooley&#x27;s story that he rescued the dog from the streets. The next day, Dooley and Jerry Lee bond when they eat together and spy on Lyman. The two are nearly killed when someone shoots at them, and the two chase the assailant to an empty building. Jerry Lee leads Dooley to the man, who falls to his death after a fistfight with Dooley. In the man&#x27;s car, Dooley finds a clue that leads him to an auto-dealer shop. There, Jerry Lee identifies a red Mercedes with drugs in it, and Dooley learns that Halstead, the owner of the dealership, works for Lyman. Later, Jerry Lee falls in love with a poodle to the disapproval of its owner.

When Dooley returns home, he discovers Lyman has kidnapped Tracy. Infuriated, Dooley crashes a party at Lyman&#x27;s mansion prompting him to be arrested his own department, but Dooley informs Byers this was intentional to fool Lyman into rushing the shipment. Byers, however, refuses to play along and takes Dooley in. Using Jerry Lee&#x27;s flatulence to an advantage, Dooley escapes with the dog. As Dooley tells Jerry Lee how he met Tracy, he spots a truck driven by Halstead that is pulling a trailer with the red Mercedes. Dooley and Jerry Lee chase the truck and arrest Halstead.

Dooley takes the truck to a stranded desert where Lyman, with Tracy hostage in his limo, is waiting. Using his videogame as a fake detonator, Dooley goads Lyman to surrender Tracy or risk the truck exploding and earning the ire of the main buyer, Gilliam. The game blows Dooley’s cover, however, and a shootout ensues where Dooley kills Dillon as Jerry Lee chases Lyman, running for Gilliam’s helicopter. Unable to outrun the dog, Lyman shoots Jerry Lee. Enraged, Dooley shoots at Lyman but Lyman is instead shot and killed by Gilliam’s henchmen. Dooley and Tracy rush Jerry Lee to a hospital, where the reluctant surgeon operates. In the recovery room, Dooley delivers a eulogy to Jerry Lee, unaware he is alive. When the surgeon tells him he is going to be fine, Dooley responds in anger, thinking he was speaking to a dead dog. Jerry Lee licks Dooley&#x27;s face out of love, making him give in.

Taking a break from police work, Dooley, Tracy, Jerry Lee, and a poodle spend a vacation together in Las Vegas.

<text>The West Cascades Scenic Byway is a National Scenic Byway in the U.S. state of Oregon. The route is designed to provide a tour on the west side of the Cascade Range along the east side of the Willamette Valley.

==Route description==
The route is roughly north–south, from Estacada southeast of Portland to Oakridge on the Willamette River southeast of Eugene. Much of the route is very sparsely populated, passing through timber regions in the Cascades.

From Estacada the route follows the valley of the Clackamas River upstream on Oregon Route 224 into the Mount Hood National Forest, then south along the Breitenbush River to Detroit on the North Santiam. It follows Oregon Route 22 along Detroit Lake to the junction of U.S. Route 20, then west a short distance on U.S. Route 20 to the junction of Oregon Route 126. It follows OR 126 south, then cuts through the mountain south to Oakridge, where it ends at an intersection with Oregon Route 58.

The route provides views of old growth fir trees and jagged volcanic peaks. The driving time is approximately 7–9 hours.

<text>Evesham Technology was a computer manufacturing and retail company based in Evesham, Worcestershire, England. It began operations in 1983 and closed in 2008 following financial difficulties. It was a significant contributor to the United Kingdom&#x27;s domestic computer and digital television market. Its assets grew to include a factory and warehouse complex, and a chain of 19 retail stores in towns and cities throughout the UK, with around 300 employees. The company was founded in 1983 by Richard Austin and Robert (Bob) Hitchcock as Evesham Micros, to be briefly known as Evesham.com and finally as Evesham Technology. Austin continued as chairman and controlling shareholder until the company and its much reduced, short-lived successor, Geemore Technology Ltd, went into liquidation.

==Company history==

Initially specialising in Amstrad computers, Evesham began trading in 1983 as Evesham Micros, and for a short while as Evesham.com. It expanded its activities to include desktop and laptop computers, software, components and peripherals, servers, storage and networking as well as gaming systems, LCD televisions, digital TV recorders, and satellite navigation. The sale of the Amstrad at competitive prices contributed to the initial success of the company. It developed and licensed a number of peripherals and upgrades for the ZX Spectrum (48K memory upgrade, Interface III cheat/copy Cartridge) and Commodore 64 (Freeze Frame cheat/copy Cartridge, Dolphin DOS disk drive accelerator, Oceanic disk drive replacement) in the second half of the 1980s.

The company continued to sell computers at discounted prices, retailing an end of line stock Olivetti PC, the UK&#x27;s first PC to be priced under £300. In December 1991, it cleared remaining stocks of the Amstrad&#x27;s PC 2000 range, including 286 and 386DX machines selling for well under £1,000. Evesham became the UK&#x27;s largest supplier of Atari ST computers, also selling them at discounted prices, having purchased large stocks. They also sold a range of software and peripherals for Amiga and Atari ST computers. Many of the products it designed were innovative and received favourable reviews by the computer press.

The company moved premises from Bridge Street to St Richards Road in 1989, opened a manufacturing plant, and began marketing under the brand name of Zydec. In early 1992 Evesham released, under the name Vale, its first home produced PC, intended to be sold as part of the Zydec product range. The Zydec name was later revived as a range of low costing PCs sold briefly alongside the Vale range. The company expanded, and acquired a number of industrial units on the Four Pools Industrial Estate. In 1998, Evesham relocated to purpose built facilities at Vale Park. In 2002 it merged with Mertec, a company established for over 20 years in Swansea, South Wales that held long-term supply and service contracts with some of the largest Welsh institutions. In mid-2004 Evesham and FalconStor Software, Inc., a leading developer of network storage infrastructure software solutions, announced an OEM agreement to supply the UK market with FalconStor&#x27;s iSCSI Storage Server for Windows Storage Server 2003(R) (iSCSI Storage Server), with Evesham&#x27;s SilverSTOR iSAN family of products.

By 2007, Evesham Technology had more than 300 employees and offered a wide range of self-manufactured, imported, and assembled products that included desktops, laptops, servers, plasma and LCD displays, Media PCs and NAS servers, peripherals, and networking equipment. Its products were marketed through its own chain of 19 retail outlets in UK towns and cities including Altrincham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Milton Keynes, Norwich, Nottingham, Peterborough, Reading, Southampton, Swansea, and Tunbridge Wells. It was a founding member of the PC Association and was one of the few major suppliers recommended by BECTA, the UK&#x27;s educational ICT advisory organisation.

==Financial problems and closure==
Evesham had invested heavily into the UK government Home Computer Initiative, and encountered financial problems when the Labour government announced the sudden withdrawal of the scheme in 2007, leading to the appointment of Leonard Curtis as administrators. In August 2007, the company received a help package in the form of an investment of $22 million from PCC Technology, a Dubai based investment fund controlled by Time Group founder Tahir Mohsan.

The chain of retail stores were closed and Evesham continued to trade as newly formed Geemore Technology Ltd., a much smaller and re-structured company under the directorship of Austin, with about one third of the Evesham workforce. Customers were not immediately affected by the change. Geemore operated from the former Evesham premises at Vale Park, and the Elite Logo Company, a dormant business owned by Tahir Mohsan and Tariq Mohammed, was registered as secretary of the new firm. In February 2008, PCC Technology, issued a press release saying that the restructuring of the failed Evesham Technology was complete and had gone well under the circumstances. They also indicated that they were looking to resell the Evesham brand which was trading under the new company, Geemore Technology Ltd. After a lack of interest from potential buyers, however, the company finally closed down towards the end of March and the three-month contracts of all remaining Evesham staff who stayed on at Geemore expired. All consumer orders were fulfilled or deposits refunded, and a large number of staff were retained by Evesham while its operations were reduced in a controlled manner. Warranties however, lost their validity as Moshan&#x27;s PCC did not provide for continued customer support under the terms of the original product guarantees.

A group of former staff from Evesham headed by former Evesham employee Robin Daunter started Tewktech, a company selling computers and offering repairs for a variety of brands including Evesham Technology.

<text>Oxford is a town in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is east of Amherst. The town is directly serviced by Routes 104, 204, 301, and 321. Despite its small size and demographic, Oxford is the world&#x27;s largest processor and distributor of individually quick frozen (IQF) wild blueberries.

==History==
Oxford was founded in 1792 by settler Richard Thompson. The name &quot;Oxford&quot; is derived from the shallow river that was used to enter the town. Early settlers used oxen to cross, or &quot;ford&quot;, the river, and thus derived the town&#x27;s name.

==Geography==
Oxford is located at the junctions of three rivers, the largest of which is River Philip. Much of the town lies in a floodplain and floods are common during the springtime. Salt Lake is located between the Black River Road and the Trans Canada Highway. A series of swamps and meadows connect this lake to the River Philip.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Oxford had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Industry ==
Oxford is considered the wild blueberry capital of Canada as it is centred in a large blueberry growing region. Oxford Frozen Foods Ltd., a wild blueberry processor, is the largest employer in the town, processing up to three million pounds of berries a day during peak season. The plant and over 12,000 acres of blueberry land are owned by local businessman, John Bragg, who added in 2014 another 15,700 acres in the Acadian region of northern New Brunswick.

Historically, the town was home to a vibrant manufacturing industry with a woollen mill and foundry being key employers.

==Transportation==
Centrally located in Cumberland County, Oxford is well connected to the provincial and national road network.

The Trans Canada Highway (Highway 104) passed near just south of the town and provincial routes 204, 301, and 321 all travel through town via Pugwash Road, Birchwood Road, Water Street, Upper/Lower Main Street and Little River Road.

In terms of public transport, the town is serviced by Maritime Bus, which stops at the Irving gas station not far off the highway.

Historically, the town had freight and passenger rail service via CN&#x27;s Oxford Subdivision, known locally as the &#x27;Short Line&#x27;, which ran from Oxford Junction to Stellarton. Passenger service was discontinued in 1960 and the line was abandoned in the 1990s.

The abandoned rail line has been reborn as a part of the Trans Canada Trail system. This section of the trail extends 127-km (78-mi) from Oxford to Pictou. It winds through farms, fields and forests for all season recreational use.

<doc id="1163275" wikidata="Q967455" url="?curid=1163275" title="Kazuo Koike">
<text>was a prolific Japanese manga writer (gensakusha), novelist, screenwriter, lyricist and entrepreneur. He is best known for his violent, artful &quot;seinen&quot; manga, notably &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; (with Goseki Kojima, 1970–6), &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; (with Kazuo Kamimura, 1972–3) and &quot;Crying Freeman&quot; (with Ryoichi Ikegami, 1986–8), which – along with their numerous media adaptations − have been credited for their influence on the international growth of Japanese popular culture.

==Career==
Early in Koike&#x27;s career, he studied under Takao Saito (the creator of &quot;Golgo 13),&quot; and served as a writer on the series.

Koike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga &quot;Kozure Okami&quot; (&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. In 1992 he himself produced a Lone Wolf and Cub&#x27;s film Lone Wolf and Cub: Final Conflict which starred Masakazu Tamura. Koike and Kojima became known as the &quot;Golden Duo&quot; because of the success of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;.

Another series written by Koike, &quot;Crying Freeman&quot;, which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans. In addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga. He has also written mahjong manga, as he himself is a former professional mahjong player.

In the early 2000s, he wrote a Wolverine story for Marvel. In 2011, Koike announced his intention to write a magical girl manga series titled &quot;Maho Shojo Mimitsuki Mimi no QED.&quot;

Koike started the &quot;Gekiga Sonjuku&quot;, a college course meant to teach people how to be a manga artist.

==Death==
On April 17, 2019, Kazuo Koike died due to pneumonia at the age of 82. His death happened just five days after the death of the fellow prolific manga author Monkey Punch on April 11, who also died of pneumonia and who Koike considered his rival in the &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; magazine.

<text>The Cerro de la Silla (&quot;Saddle Hill&quot;) is a mountain and natural monument, It is part of the foothills system of the Sierra Madre Oriental. It is found covering territorial parts of the municipalities of Guadalupe (31.62%), Monterrey (13.23%) and Juárez (55.15%), in the state of Nuevo León, and constitutes an icon of the city of Monterrey and a symbol for the people of Monterrey.

It covers an area of 60.5 square kilometres (23 mi2). The mountain has four peaks: Pico Antena, Pico Norte, Pico Sur and Pico la Virgen; Pico Norte (North Peak) is the highest at while Pico la Virgen (Virgin&#x27;s Peak) is the lowest at .

Set aside as a natural monument by the Mexican government in 1991, the mountain, or &quot;hill&quot;, as mountains are often referred to in Mexico, is a popular recreational area and is often climbed by hikers who take a trail to reach the top. The ascent is considered to be fairly difficult, taking approximately 3 hours to complete. A panoramic view of the city of Monterrey can be seen from the top.

In the second half of the 20th century, an aerial tramway (Teleférico en Monterrey) was built on the north side of the mountain to give a fastest access to the iconic mountain for the population. The day of its inauguration on June 2, 1961, was also the day of its closure, as a tragic accident took the lives of five people, including the engineer Jesús Fernández, its designer. Only the upper station remains of the tramway. Several plans have been announced to rebuild another tramway with no results.

Some other known mountains or elevations of the zone are: Cerro de las Mitras, the Sierra Madre Oriental with the Cerro de Chipinque —the M-shaped figure visible from various parts of the city—, the Cerro del Topo Chico, Cerro del Obispado, Cerro de la Loma Larga and La Huasteca.

<text>Hedley Verity (18 May 1905 – 31 July 1943) was a professional cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England between 1930 and 1939. A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, he took 1,956 wickets in first-class cricket at an average of 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40 Tests at an average of 24.37. 

Named as one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is regarded as one of the most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be almost impossible to bat against.

Verity was born in Leeds and, from an early age, wished to play cricket for Yorkshire. After establishing a good reputation in local cricket, he signed a contract as a professional cricketer playing in the Lancashire League. His first season was not a success but, after moving clubs, he began to make a name for himself. Initially a medium-paced bowler, he switched to bowling spin in an attempt to secure a place in the Yorkshire team. When Wilfred Rhodes, the incumbent Yorkshire left-arm spinner, announced his retirement, Verity had a successful trial in the team in 1930, and led the national bowling averages. In 1931, his first full season, he achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, against Warwickshire; the following year, he again took all 10 wickets, against Nottinghamshire, while conceding just 10 runs. The latter bowling figures remain a record in first-class cricket for the fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets. He established himself as part of a strong bowling unit, which helped Yorkshire win the County Championship seven times in his ten seasons with the club. In that time, Verity was never lower than fifth in the bowling averages and took over 150 wickets in every year except his first.

In 1931, he was chosen to play for England for the first time and rose to prominence during a tour to Australia in 1932–33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best performance of his career when he took 15 wickets against Australia in a Test match at Lord&#x27;s in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting pitches, and he was occasionally left out of the England team over the following years. Even so, he had one of the best records of any bowler against Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket. Verity continued to play for Yorkshire and England until 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War ended his career.

Verity joined the Green Howards in 1939, and after training was posted overseas to India, Persia and Egypt, achieving the rank of captain. During the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, he was severely wounded and captured by the Germans. Taken to the Italian mainland, he died in Caserta from his injuries and was buried there.

==Early years==
Verity was born in Headingley, an area of Leeds, on 18 May 1905. He was the eldest child of Hedley Verity, who worked for a local coal company, and Edith Elwick, a Sunday school teacher. Verity also had two sisters, Grace and Edith. The family moved to Armley, then to the more rural location of Rawdon. From an early age, Verity watched Yorkshire play County Cricket matches at Leeds, Bradford and, during family holidays, Scarborough. Later, at Yeadon and Guiseley Secondary School, Verity played school cricket, bowling left-arm medium-paced deliveries; he maintained this style until 1929 and was capable of bowling both inswingers and outswingers. Verity left school aged 14 to work for his father, who had established a coal business in Guiseley, and played cricket for Rawdon&#x27;s second team. Success on the field persuaded Verity to seek a career in professional cricket and a place in the Yorkshire team. While working for his father, he devoted increasing amounts of time to cricket practice.

In 1921, Verity made his debut for Rawdon in league cricket; some of his subsequent performances attracted the notice of the local press, and he took 29 wickets at an average of 13.80 that season. The following season, he was spotted by Yorkshire coach George Hirst and former England spinner Bobby Peel, who were talent scouting for Yorkshire, and given a trial in the cricket nets at Headingley. Peel realised Verity was an intelligent bowler who had excellent control of where he pitched the ball, but believed he was not fast enough to be effective for Yorkshire. Meanwhile, critics in Rawdon began to see increased potential in his batting, which improved steadily; by 1924, the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; described Verity as &quot;one of the most promising cricketers in the Leeds district&quot;.

Verity moved to play for Horsforth Hall Park in 1924, where his batting became more productive than his bowling. By 1926, when he scored a total of 488 runs and took 62 wickets to win the Yorkshire Council League prize for best junior bowler, his all-round potential secured a second trial at Yorkshire. Receiving coaching from Hirst, Verity played several matches for the Yorkshire Colts. He was given little bowling to do, suggesting that he was chosen more for his batting at this stage, and was near the bottom of the team&#x27;s bowling averages. Yorkshire did not allocate him to a local club, their practice towards promising cricketers at the time. Hirst was nevertheless impressed by Verity and recommended him to Accrington Cricket Club, a team in the Lancashire League looking for a professional cricketer. After a trial, Verity signed a contract in September 1926.

==League professional==
Verity was unsuccessful during the 1927 season, his only one with Accrington. His bowling was less effective than the club had hoped; he endured spells where he took few wickets and was unable to implement the tactics or bowl in the style that the club expected. His batting average for the season was 5.25. The team, containing players far more experienced than Verity, were unimpressed by his performances and unsympathetic to his difficulties, offering him little support in the field. Even so, the club were prepared to offer an improved contract for 1928, but he declined as Accrington had previously refused to release their players for county cricket. Verity signed a contract with Middleton, a club in the Central Lancashire Cricket League. Limited in resources, the club paid him less than Accrington, but guaranteed his release to play for Yorkshire if he were selected. Playing with young teammates, Verity worked hard to coach the players and develop team spirit. 

He made a modest start in his first season, and was initially rated as a useful but unimpressive all-rounder. A visit to the Yorkshire nets around this time prompted Verity to alter his bowling style. Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire&#x27;s main spinner since 1898, was considering retirement; he and Hirst suggested that, as there were fewer spinners than medium-pace bowlers, Verity was more likely to achieve selection if he switched to spin bowling. With the support of the Middleton team and committee, Verity started bowling spin at the beginning of the 1929 season and immediately began to attract attention from counties, culminating in an unsuccessful nets trial for Warwickshire. Later in the season, when Verity went to Headingley to watch Yorkshire play, he was asked to fill a vacancy in the Yorkshire Colts team. In the match, he took five wickets for seven runs in the second innings. By the end of the season, he had taken 100 wickets for Middleton and topped the Central Lancashire League bowling averages.

For the 1930 season, Verity received lucrative contract offers from several Lancashire League clubs, worth more than three times his Middleton salary. Although recently married and receiving little encouragement from the Yorkshire committee, he eventually rejected the offers. In the event, Middleton allowed Verity to play for Yorkshire during 1930 and later released him from his contract. Cricket historian Derek Hodgson notes that Verity&#x27;s years in the Lancashire Leagues &quot;meant that he reached Yorkshire ... as a hardened and experienced performer&quot;.

==County cricketer==

===First-class debut===

Early in 1930, Wilfred Rhodes announced that he intended to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season. Several spin bowlers were considered as his replacement; Hirst, who watched them all bowl in the nets, considered Verity the most impressive. Verity made his first-class debut on 21 May 1930 in an early-season non-Championship match against Sussex. Rhodes, who missed the match, spent the game watching Verity and seemed convinced afterwards that his successor had been found. 

Bowling in two innings, Verity took three wickets for 96 in 46.1 overs; in the process, he won praise from the press, particularly for preventing the batsmen from scoring. Rhodes returned for the next match; Verity appeared only once more in May, taking eight wickets in the match against Leicestershire, and once in June. In his fourth game, he took nine for 60 in the second innings against Glamorgan and 12 wickets in the match. Rain had damaged the pitch, making it difficult to bat against spinners. After this, Verity played regularly alongside Rhodes, and, helped by a succession of rain-affected pitches, took a total of 64 wickets in 12 games at an average of 12.42, figures which placed him top of the national bowling averages. His best performance came against Hampshire when he took 13 wickets for 83 runs, including seven for 26 in the first innings.

Rhodes and Emmott Robinson, the senior professionals in the Yorkshire team, discussed tactics with Verity and his friend and teammate Bill Bowes, to analyse their errors. Bowes later wrote: &quot;To Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson ... I owe most for what I learned of first-class cricket—and Hedley Verity shared my debt.&quot; Verity enjoyed long technical discussions with Rhodes and, according to Hirst, took in the advice &quot;like a sponge takes water&quot;. Even successful performances were critiqued, including Verity&#x27;s against Glamorgan and Hampshire. At the end of the season, critics in the press seemed convinced a successor to Rhodes had been found, and Verity was spoken of as a certainty to become an England regular.

===Test debut===
When the 1931 season started, many critics and journalists watched Verity closely to see how he compared to Rhodes. Their initial impressions were favourable as Verity took five for 42 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Yorkshire&#x27;s first match of the season and five for 42 against Cambridge University. Then, in his fifth game, Verity became only the second man, after Alonzo Drake, to take all 10 wickets in a single innings for Yorkshire. Against Warwickshire, on his 26th birthday, Verity took 10 for 36 in the second innings, having taken three wickets in the first innings, to give Yorkshire an innings victory.

Verity followed this performance with five for 54 against Lancashire, but a week after his 10 wickets against Warwickshire, Frank Woolley hit four sixes from Verity&#x27;s bowling as the Yorkshire bowler conceded 70 runs from 12 overs without taking a wicket. The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord&#x27;s, where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen&#x27;s first innings. He was also selected in the less prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Scarborough and was awarded his county cap by Yorkshire. Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team, Verity was selected in the final two Test matches of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity. On his debut, he took four wickets for 75 runs in the game. &quot;The Cricketer&quot; noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin the ball well. England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl. In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188 wickets at an average of 13.52, finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages. Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, owed much of their success to Verity&#x27;s bowling. Verity was selected as one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in the pace and flight of his bowling.

===World record===

Yorkshire made a poor start to the 1932 season. The team lost heavily to Lancashire, for whom Eddie Paynter scored 152 runs and hit Verity for five sixes. Although Verity had figures of eight for 107, he was expected to be more successful as the pitch conditions were perfect for spin bowling. Neville Cardus wrote that his figures were &quot;bad for the pitch. He can spin the ball keenly enough, but lacks a plan in his control of length. Moreover, he seldom gets the batsman guessing while the ball is in the air.&quot; However, Yorkshire improved their form in the rest of the season to retain the County title. Between them, Verity and Bowes took 352 wickets in the season, and Verity took 162 wickets at an average of 13.88 to finish second in the national bowling averages. 

Verity&#x27;s best performance of the season came at Headingley on 12 July, the third and final day of Yorkshire&#x27;s match against Nottinghamshire. After heavy rain on the second day, Brian Sellers, the Yorkshire captain, closed his team&#x27;s innings while they still trailed by 71 runs. When Nottinghamshire began their second innings, Verity did not concede any runs from his first nine overs. Subsequently, the pitch became difficult to bat on as it dried in the sun and Verity took all 10 wickets while 10 runs were hit from his bowling. Making the ball spin sharply, he took seven wickets in 15 deliveries, including a hat-trick. His bowling figures of 10 for 10 beat the previous record for fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets, and remain the best bowling analysis in first-class cricket. He is the only Yorkshire bowler to take all 10 wickets in an innings on two separate occasions. Yorkshire won the match by 10 wickets. Despite Verity&#x27;s success, he was not selected for any Gentlemen v Players matches, nor in the Test match against India. His only representative cricket came in a Test trial at the end of July, in which he did not bowl as the match was washed out by rain.

Verity had been advised by friends at the start of the season that he would need an exceptional performance to achieve selection on the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia; Alan Hill believes the performance against Nottinghamshire guaranteed Verity would be chosen to tour. In the middle of August, Verity was one of the last men added to the MCC team captained by Douglas Jardine.

==International cricketer==

===Bodyline tour===

Jardine planned to use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested. However, Verity was not expected to be a big success on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity&#x27;s lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack, but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of Don Bradman, against a Combined XI, comprising some of the best Australian players. In the following game, against South Australia, Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings. By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity&#x27;s achievements, and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed his admiration for Verity. 

Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17 overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly. England won the match, using bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour. After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.

Verity regained his place in the team for the third Test, replacing Bowes. The match was highly controversial owing to England&#x27;s continued and increased use of bodyline tactics. Verity&#x27;s main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45 runs in the first innings and 40 in the second. He took one wicket in the game; after 16 wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338 runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76 runs behind Australia&#x27;s score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis. The two men scored 92 runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the Ashes. Verity&#x27;s bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen&#x27;s scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets. Having taken three for 62 in Australia&#x27;s first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.

In the Test series, Verity totalled 11 wickets at an average of 24.65, second in the bowling averages to Larwood. Verity took three more wickets in his last matches of the tour, which included his appearance in one of the two Tests against New Zealand at the end of the tour. In all first-class games in Australia, he took 44 wickets at 15.86, leading the first-class bowling averages for the tourists; he took one further wicket in New Zealand. &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; tour report noted Verity&#x27;s &quot;fine bowling record&quot; and that he performed well. Jardine, in a letter to Verity&#x27;s father, wrote: &quot;Hedley has come through his first tour triumphantly, no mean feat to start with the stiffest tour, but particularly for a slow left-hander. On and off the field, Hedley has been a real friend and a grand help to me&quot;.

===Series against West Indies===
In the 1933 season, when Yorkshire won their third consecutive County Championship, Verity took 190 wickets at an average of 13.43 to be fifth in the national averages; in eight matches he took 10 or more wickets, and achieved five wickets in an innings 18 times. In seven consecutive innings, he secured a total of 50 wickets, becoming only the third player to achieve this feat in first-class cricket. He also scored over 600 runs in the season, his highest aggregate to date, including three fifties—his first in English first-class cricket. Verity represented the Players against the Gentlemen and played in the first two of three Tests against the West Indies, taking four for 45 in the first match and capturing seven wickets at an average of 21.85 in the series. He was left out of the final game in favour of Charles Marriott, but in two other games against the tourists, Verity took a total of 22 wickets. Against Essex, Verity achieved another record by taking 17 wickets in a single day&#x27;s play, the second of three players to achieve this feat, on a pitch damaged by rain. In contrast, against Surrey, Yorkshire conceded 560 runs and Verity, frustrated at the lack of a declaration, first bowled extremely negatively and then bowled two underarm deliveries that the umpire called no-ball as Verity had not informed the batsmen of his intention. This was an unusually public reaction for Verity and his captain ordered him to resume normal bowling. At the end of the season, an MCC team toured India and played Tests there for the first time. Jardine was chosen as captain, and Verity was the only other player from the Bodyline series to tour, although others declined an invitation.

===Tour of India===

Jardine approached the tour with a competitive attitude and made thorough preparations. The match attendances were high and the public followed the cricket very closely. Verity enjoyed the tour and established a lasting friendship with Charlie Barnett; Verity helped Barnett to overcome his homesickness and to develop his understanding of cricket. Verity was the leading first-class wicket-taker on the tour, although he was second in the team averages, with 72 wickets at an average of 15.54. In the first match of the tour against Sind, he took six for 46 and 10 wickets in the game. His best figures were seven for 37 against the Viceroy&#x27;s XI and he took five wickets in an innings on five occasions. Against an Indian XI, he achieved his then-highest first-class score of 91 not out. On the same ground, in the second Test match, Verity took eight wickets in the drawn game and scored 55 not out, his maiden Test fifty. As England had won the first Test, the third and final match would decide the series. Verity was again successful with the bat, scoring 42 and sharing a partnership of 97 with Jardine. Then with the ball, Verity took seven for 49 as the Indian batsmen struggled against his accuracy. Four wickets in the second innings gave him eleven wickets for 153 in the match, the first time he had taken 10 or more wickets in a Test match. In the three Tests, Verity took 23 wickets at an average of 16.82, leading the bowling averages for the series.

Jardine, who retired from regular first-class cricket after the tour, had little patience with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, when they were having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: &quot;Thank God we have one bowler in the side&quot;—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity was impressed with the depth of Jardine&#x27;s thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain&#x27;s stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: &quot;I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets ... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself.&quot; Historian David Frith writes that Verity was &quot;probably the cricketer [Jardine] admired above all others&quot;, while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.

===Series against Australia in 1934===
In the 1934 season, Verity took 150 wickets at an average of 17.63, placing him third in the national averages. That year, the Australians toured England and Verity was selected for all five Test matches. Australia won the first game—Verity took two wickets. At Lord&#x27;s, in the second match, England scored 440 in their first innings but after the second day&#x27;s play, Australia were well positioned, having reached 192 for two wickets. Verity was the only bowler to trouble the batsmen and caught and bowled Bradman, who had scored a quick 36 runs. After rain fell overnight, the pitch changed to become helpful to spin; &quot;Wisden&quot; reported that: &quot;although the wicket certainly helped [Verity] considerably it could scarcely be described as genuinely sticky except for one period after lunch.&quot; On the third day, Australia lost their last eight wickets while scoring 92 runs. Verity took six of the wickets to achieve bowling figures of seven for 61. The tourists just failed to score enough runs to make England bat again and were forced to follow on: Cardus wrote: &quot;Verity settled the issue like a great bowler&quot;. England wicket-keeper Les Ames believed this was crucial to an England victory, or the home team would have batted in very difficult conditions. When Australia batted again, Verity took eight for 43, dismissing Bradman a second time, to give him match figures of 15 for 104; 14 of the wickets came on the third day. Cardus believed the Australian batsmen played very badly against Verity&#x27;s spin, while the &quot;Wisden&quot; correspondent wrote: &quot;This amazing achievement would probably have been only possible to a man possessed of such length and finger-spin as Verity ... Verity&#x27;s length was impeccable and he made the ball come back and lift so abruptly that most of the Australians were helpless. The majority of them had had no experience in England of such a pitch, and they showed no ability or skill in dealing with bowling like that of Verity under these conditions; their efforts at playing back were, to say the least, immature.&quot; Afterwards, this game became known in cricket circles as &quot;Verity&#x27;s match&quot;; it was the only occasion in the 20th century when England beat Australia at Lord&#x27;s, and their last such win for 75 years.

The third match was played on a very good pitch for batting in extremely hot weather, and England did not have a strong bowling attack in the view of &quot;Wisden&quot;. England scored 627, of which Verity scored 60 not out; &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that he batted slowly but well. Australia replied with 491 when they batted; Verity took four for 78 in 53 overs and was able to prevent the batsmen scoring quickly. The match was eventually drawn. Cardus, in criticising the English bowlers in the game, wrote: &quot;Verity is apparently the only England bowler in existence at the present time—and he is not subtle on a hard wicket.&quot; Poor weather prevented an English defeat in the fourth Test, as Bradman and Bill Ponsford shared a partnership of 388 runs; Verity took three wickets but, in doing so, conceded 113 runs. The final, decisive game, was won by Australia, who therefore regained the Ashes. Bradman and Ponsford this time scored 451 runs together as their team totalled 701; Verity was wicketless in the match and conceded 166 runs. Cardus, assessing the English bowling, regretted that England did not have a bowler capable of flighting the ball, a role usually performed by left-arm spinners. Verity took 24 wickets in the series at 24.00, finishing second in the averages. Reviewing the series, &quot;Wisden&quot; editor Sydney Southerton wrote, &quot;Verity, apart from his one amazing performance at Lord&#x27;s, could be complimented upon his steadiness rather than upon his effectiveness on hard wickets&quot;. Verity also made other representative appearances in the season; Yorkshire dropped to sixth position, handicapped by the limited appearances of four players who were regularly absent at representative matches.

===Career in the mid-1930s===
During the 1935 season Yorkshire regained the County Championship, and Verity passed 200 wickets for the first time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the national averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22 times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41 overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30 runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: &quot;Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn&#x27;t know whether to hit you for four or six!&quot; South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25 overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40 overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; correspondent observed: &quot;Verity again failed to worry South Africa&#x27;s batsmen&quot;. With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball.
&quot;The Times&quot; correspondent wrote: &quot;Verity has not been impressive on firm wickets: he seems to have checked suddenly in a career which promised so well three seasons ago, and it is not surprising that he has been left out of this side.&quot; Nevertheless, he took 12 wickets at 20.83, leading the Test bowling averages for England. Verity was not selected in any other representative cricket that season.

The Yorkshire team played three first-class matches in Jamaica in early 1936. Yorkshire won the first game, Jamaica&#x27;s first defeat at home in a first-class game for 10 years. Verity took 10 for 106 in 57 overs. The other matches, played on very good batting wickets, were drawn. In the final game, Verity scored 101, his only first-class century. Batting aggressively, he hit 10 fours and his second fifty runs came in just over an hour. In total, Verity took 16 wickets, averaging 22.50, and scored 195 runs at 48.75.

In the 1936 English season, in which Yorkshire finished second to Derbyshire in the Championship, Verity took 216 wickets, the highest seasonal total of his career, at an average of 13.18, which placed him second in the national averages. Against Kent, he returned nine wickets for 12 runs and took 15 wickets in the game, one of seven games in which he captured 10 or more wickets. In addition, he scored his highest aggregate of runs, accumulating 855 runs at an average of 31.66; at one point, Verity led the Yorkshire batting averages. Playing for his county against the Indian touring team, Verity achieved his highest first-class innings in England with 96 not out. He played in all three Test matches against India, a team which failed to live up to expectations and suffered internal divisions. G. O. B. &quot;Gubby&quot; Allen, the England captain, won the toss in the first Test and bowled first on the advice of Verity, but the latter was less successful than expected and Allen later described this as one of the few occasions he saw him bowl poorly. India established a first innings lead, but were bowled out for 93 in their second innings and easily lost the match; Verity took four for 17. The second Test was a draw in which he took four for 41 in the first innings and scored 66, his highest Test score. England won the final Test to take the series 1–0; Verity took four wickets in the game. In the series he took 15 wickets at an average of 15.20, finishing top of the England bowling averages. He also appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen and in a Test trial for the North against the South. Regarded as a certainty to tour Australia during the 1936–37, Verity was among the first seven players selected and his name was announced before the second Test against India.

===Second tour to Australia===
Under the captaincy of Allen, Verity began the tour well. He took 16 wickets before the Tests began with best figures of five for 50 against Queensland, his only five wicket haul of the Australian leg of the tour. England won the first two Tests of the series, assisted by poor weather which altered pitch conditions in their favour. In the first match, England scored 358 and bowled Australia out for 234. Although Verity took just one wicket, &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; correspondent praised him, reporting: &quot;Among the bowlers ... Verity must not be forgotten. In the first innings he bowled in his best form and contributed to many of [Bill] Voce&#x27;s wickets ... So difficult was Verity to score from that batsmen in desperation tried to get runs off Voce, with disastrous results to themselves.&quot; After England set Australia 381 to win, rain damaged the pitch; Allen and Voce bowled the home team out for 58. In the second Test, England won by an innings, again assisted by rain. Verity took three wickets in the match, including that of Bradman.

The turning point of the series was the third Test. On the first day, Verity again dismissed Bradman and the England bowlers performed well in good batting conditions before rain altered the state of the pitch. Australia declared their innings closed at 200 for nine and after losing nine wickets for 76, England also declared, hoping to make Australia bat on a still-difficult pitch. In much easier batting conditions, Australia made 564, of which Bradman scored 270. Verity bowled nearly 38 eight-ball overs and took three for 79. Cardus wrote: &quot;Verity was magnificent ... In his absence Bradman might have scored another 100 runs. Nothing but consummate length and flight could have checked Bradman, in circumstances made for Bradman ... Every run from Verity had to be earnt. It was beautiful bowling, delightful to the eye and intellect.&quot; &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; report said: &quot;Voce and Verity were outstanding England bowlers. The latter kept an immaculate length and allowed no batsman to take liberties with him.&quot; England were bowled out for 323 and lost the game.

In an attempt to solve their problem in finding a reliable opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53 runs together, England&#x27;s best opening partnership of the series. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised Verity&#x27;s defence but said he had not solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett. England scored 330 but Australia&#x27;s second innings of 433 left England needing 392. Barnett and Verity began with a stand of 45, but England lost by 148 runs. In two innings, Verity scored 19 and 17, but was wicketless in the match. Having levelled the series, Australia won the final match by a large margin to take the series 3–2. Verity took just one wicket in the match. In the series, he took 10 wickets at an average of 45.50; in all first-class matches in Australia, he captured 28 wickets at 30.75 and secured 10 wickets at 18.20 in two matches in New Zealand at the end of the tour. The &quot;Wisden&quot; report on the tour said: &quot;Verity admirably performed the task of keeping one end closed and took high honours for his consistently good work.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent, noting the failure of the wrist spinners selected to tour, wrote: &quot;Australia ... beat us because they have spin bowlers who make the ball truly spin. Verity certainly never had a wicket on which to demonstrate his art, so exposing the fact that real spin bowling does not at the moment exist in England.&quot;

During the 1937 season, Verity played only one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and although batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.

===Ashes series of 1938===
Verity took 158 first-class wickets in 1938 at an average of 15.38, placing him third once more in the national averages; Bowes was second in the list and Yorkshire retained the Championship. After appearing in a trial match, Verity played in all four Tests against Australia, during a series which was tied 1–1. In the first match, England scored 658 and according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, the new England captain Wally Hammond decided to keep Verity in reserve in the expectation of making Australia follow-on; he bowled just 45 balls in Australia&#x27;s first innings. Australia did follow-on, and in the second innings, Verity bowled 62 overs to take three wickets for 102, bowling very accurately, but the batsmen played him skilfully and the match was drawn. In the second match, Verity took four for 103 out of an Australian total of 422, in reply to England&#x27;s 494. After Verity had taken two wickets in eight balls, Australia were in danger of having to follow-on, but Bill O&#x27;Reilly struck him for two consecutive sixes to remove the possibility. Verity took two wickets in the second innings, but the match was drawn. After the third match was abandoned owing to rain, Australia won the fourth Test, held at Headingley, by five wickets to ensure the Ashes were retained. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that: &quot;At no time was the wicket easy for batting and Australia won largely because they possessed better spin bowling.&quot; Verity took two wickets in the match, but some critics believed his bowling could have won the match had Hammond used him more effectively. In a match where the Australian spinner O&#x27;Reilly took 10 wickets, Hammond used his fast bowlers Bowes and Ken Farnes for the majority of both innings. Commentators believed Hammond over-used his fast bowlers; Cardus wrote: &quot;Hammond&#x27;s faith in fast bowling rather exceeded his faith in the arts of Verity and Wright. The result was sad disillusionment.&quot; Barnett also said that Hammond refused to allow Verity to alter his bowling tactics, when the Yorkshire bowler wished to aim for a worn area on the pitch.

As neither side had established a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, no matter how long it took. England scored a record team total of 903 runs and Australia were heavily defeated. Verity, one of five Yorkshire players in the team, bowled 12 overs in the game and took two wickets. He also played a part in the achievement of Len Hutton, who scored 364 runs, breaking the record for the highest individual innings in a Test match. As Hutton&#x27;s innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: &quot;I owe [Verity] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay ... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout those long hours&quot;. The series was drawn; Verity took 14 wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond&#x27;s poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests. Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower&#x27;s team which defeated the tourists by 10 wickets.

===Tour to South Africa and final season===
In the winter of 1938–39, Verity toured South Africa with the MCC team under Hammond&#x27;s captaincy. He took 47 wickets at 19.93 in first-class games. In the first game of the tour, Verity took 11 wickets against Griqualand West. In the Test matches, the batsmen played in a negative fashion, despite pitches that were very good for batting. High scoring games left the bowlers with expensive figures and Verity had the best bowling average on either side, bowling accurately and reliably. He played in all five Test matches, taking 19 wickets at 29.05. The first two matches were drawn: in the first innings of the opening Test, he took four for 61 in 44 eight-ball overs; in the first innings of the second Test, he took five for 70 in nearly 37 overs. England won the third match, the only result in the series and the fourth was also drawn. The final game was to be played without a time limit until there was a winner; after 10 days it had to be abandoned as the MCC had to catch a boat home. The match established a record at the time for the total number of runs scored in a first-class game, as both teams combined to post an aggregate of 1,981 runs. Verity took four wickets and bowled 766 balls in the game, establishing a new record for deliveries in a first-class game. It proved difficult to score runs from Verity&#x27;s bowling but the batsmen generally were very cautious.

Verity&#x27;s final first-class cricket came in the 1939 season which was overshadowed by the forthcoming war. Yorkshire won their third successive County Championship and the seventh of Verity&#x27;s career. Verity took 191 wickets at an average of 13.13, to top the bowling averages for the second time in his career. Verity&#x27;s only representative cricket came in the first Test match against West Indies, when he took two wickets in the match. He was subsequently left out of the team for the second Test in favour of Tom Goddard, and did not play any more Test matches. However, &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; report on the third Test commented that his absence and that of several other bowlers left the English attack weaker. In a career total of 40 Tests, Verity took 144 wickets at an average of 24.37 and scored 669 runs at an average of 20.90. With much of the end of the cricket season abandoned prior to the expected outbreak of war, Verity played his last match against Sussex. In the second innings, Verity took seven wickets for nine runs on a rain-affected pitch to bowl Sussex out for 33 and take Yorkshire to a win, although the match was played in a strained, tense atmosphere. This was Verity&#x27;s last performance in first-class cricket. In total, he had taken 1,956 wickets at an average of 14.90 and scored 5,603 runs at 18.07.

==Style and technique==
As a bowler, Verity delivered the ball at almost medium pace, faster than usual for a spinner. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, a cricket writer and journalist, wrote &quot;He is a scholarly bowler ... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that you would expect from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can&#x27;t explain.&quot; His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply. His most effective delivery curved through the air, pitched on middle and leg stump and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge the ball into the slips. On rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times. However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated. In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets. Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.

Verity never spun the ball very far, particularly after his second tour to Australia, and preferred to concentrate on bowling a good length. However, critics did not think that Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: &quot;Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket.&quot; At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.
Verity earned the respect of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he &quot;grew more and more to respect [Verity] both as a gentleman and as a player.&quot; Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was &quot;one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms&quot;. During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: &quot;I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there&#x27;s no breaking-point with him.&quot;

Verity is often cited as one of the greatest slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: &quot;We can only say that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind.&quot; The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but &quot;as a workman-artist, he will take some beating.&quot; Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners, and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against. Bradman wrote: &quot;Undoubtedly he was one of the greatest slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity&#x27;s equal and of the Englishmen I saw ... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others.&quot;

As a batsman, Verity occasionally showed potential to become good, making one first-class century during his career, but concentrated his energy on bowling. He modelled his batting on Herbert Sutcliffe, and Robertson-Glasgow wrote: &quot;As a batsman, he looks like Sutcliffe gone stale. That is, pretty good.&quot;

==Military service==

===Training with the Green Howards===
Since around 1937, Verity had expected the outbreak of the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes&#x27; wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following a spell at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1st Battalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training. Verity&#x27;s Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord&#x27;s. In August, he returned to England and after a spell in London, he was posted overseas.

The 1st battalion of the Green Howards transferred early in 1942 to Ranchi in India, where the climate badly affected Verity&#x27;s health. After suffering from dysentery, he was weak and his doctors wished to send him home. However, he resumed his position and, by the end of the year, his battalion was sent to Persia. In March 1943, the battalion was posted to Kibrit Air Base in Egypt for training and then to Qatana in Syria. Here, preparations were finalised for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Verity remained below peak fitness and was struggling a little owing to his age. His commanding officers planned to withdraw him from front-line fighting and move him to a staff position at headquarters once the Sicily campaign had concluded.

===Death===

The invasion of Sicily was initially successful until the Allied forces reached the plains outside Catania, where German forces put up strong resistance. The Green Howards, as part of the 15th Brigade, made a night attack on 19 July. However, conditions were more difficult than expected and the brigade came under heavy fire. Verity commanded B Company, which was surrounded in the confusion. Attempting to secure the position, Verity was hit in the chest by shrapnel and had to be left behind as the company retreated. The last order he gave was &quot;keep going&quot;.

Severely wounded and subsequently captured by the Germans, Verity was taken to a field hospital and underwent an operation. Taken by boat across the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, Verity first went to a hospital in Reggio Calabria and was then transported for two days by train to Naples. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at Caserta. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31 July, and was buried with full military honours. His grave was later moved from the town&#x27;s cemetery to the military cemetery established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

Bradman wrote in an obituary: &quot;I cannot ever recall hearing Verity utter a word of complaint or criticism ... if reports of his final sacrifice be correct ... he maintained this example right to the end.&quot; When first-class cricket resumed in 1945, Yorkshire staged a memorial match for Verity against Lancashire at Bradford Park Avenue, which resulted in a draw. Later, several Yorkshire players visited his grave; some members of the MCC team under Len Hutton&#x27;s captaincy in 1954–55, including Hutton, journalists and former Yorkshire player Abe Waddington paid tribute there while en route for Australia.

==Personal life==

Verity married Kathleen Alice Metcalfe, a bookbinder and the daughter of a sales agent, on 7 March 1929. The two had known each other as children in Headingley and met again at a Rawdon youth club social event. They had two sons, first Wilfred, named after Wilfred Rhodes, and then George Douglas, named after George Hirst and Douglas Jardine.

Shortly before the outbreak of the war, Kathleen Verity began to suffer from poor health, and the family planned a trip to South Africa in the English winter of 1939 to aid her recovery and so Verity could take up one of several offers of a coaching job. In the last months before Hedley Verity went overseas during the war, Kathleen joined him in Omagh and later in London just before he went away.

The Hedley Verity, a branch of Wetherspoons in Leeds city centre, is named after Verity and there is a Blue plaque on the house he was born in.

<text>Albert III of Austria (9 September 1349 – 29 August 1395), known as Albert with the Braid (Pigtail) (), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria from 1365 until his death.

== Biography ==
Albert III was born in the ducal residence of Vienna, the third son of the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria and his wife Joanna of Pfirt. Even though his father had determined a house law, whereby the four sons were obliged to rule jointly and equally, the eldest brother Rudolf IV assumed the reins of government after his father&#x27;s death in 1358. He reaffirmed his supremacy issuing the &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot;. However, as his marriage remained childless he again had to share his power with his younger brothers. In 1365 Rudolf IV, Albert III, and Leopold III together signed the foundation certificate of the Vienna University (&quot;Alma Mater Rudolphina Vindobonensis&quot;); Rudolf died a few months later at the age of 25.

===Divided rule===
Albert, then the eldest surviving brother (the second-born son Frederick III had already died in 1362), inherited the rule and shared it with his younger brother Leopold III. Both were formally enfeoffed with the Duchy of Austria, Duchy of Styria, Duchy of Carinthia, and Duchy of Carniola by Emperor Charles IV. In 1369 the Habsburg dukes succeeded the late Meinhard III, Count of Gorizia-Tyrol in the County of Tyrol, when after a drawn-out conflict the Wittelsbach Duke Stephen II of Bavaria finally renounced his rights.

In 1368 the Habsburg brothers purchased the Swabian city of Freiburg. But their attempt to gain control over the Adriatic port of Trieste failed in an armed conflict with the Republic of Venice in 1369/70. Trieste was not won until 1382, when the citizens sought protection from Venice by subjecting themselves to Austrian rule. In 1374 the Austrian dukes inherited large territories in the Windic March and Istria from the late Albert III, Count of Gorizia, which they attached to the Duchy of Carniola. The next year they acquired the Swabian lordship of Feldkirch from the Counts of Montfort, the nucleus of the Habsburg possessions in later Vorarlberg.

Tension developed between the brothers, and in 1379 Albert and Leopold, by the Treaty of Neuberg divided the extended Habsburg territories. Albert received Austria proper (&quot;Austria Inferior&quot;), while Leopold get Styria, Carinthia and Carniola (&quot;Austria Interior&quot;), Tyrol (&quot;Austria Superior&quot;) and the dynasty&#x27;s original possessions in Swabia (&quot;Austria Anterior&quot;). The division of the Habsburgs into the Albertinian Line and Leopoldian line was a significant disadvantage in competition with the rival Wittelsbach and Luxembourg dynasties. It persisted until 1490, when Archduke Sigismund of Tyrol and Further Austria handed over his estates to his cousin King Maximilian I.

===Politics===
In 1377, Albert went on a crusade in Prussia against pagan Baltic Lithuanian and Samogitian tribes.

Meanwhile, the expansion of the Habsburg dukes in Swabia collided with the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy and sparked armed revolts. In 1386 Duke Leopold III and numerous Austrian nobles were killed in a disastrous defeat at the 1386 Battle of Sempach, whereafter Albert once again became sole ruler over the Albertinian and Leopoldian lands, acting as regent for his minor nephews. Another attempt to restore Habsburg rule in Swabia failed, when Albert&#x27;s knights were again defeated by the Swiss pike squares in the 1388 Battle of Näfels and the duke had to call for an armistice. 

In the Austrian lands, his government was beneficial to the realm, as he supported the arts and sciences. Albert was an apt scholar himself, particularly as a mathematician and astrologer. The eldest preserved book of the Austrian National Library, a 1386 Evangelion, comes from his personal property. The duke expanded the University of Vienna and, during the Western Schism, reached the consent of Pope Urban VI to establish a theological faculty. He continued the building of St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral and attempted to refurbish Vienna modelled on Emperor Charles&#x27; residence in Prague. Albert&#x27;s nickname refers to his particular hairstyle, part of the vestments of a short-lived chivalric order (&quot;Zopforden&quot;) he had established and which dissolved upon his death.

By the end of his reign, Albert had established a firm princely rule over the Austrian duchy, stretching along the Danube from the Hungarian border on the Leitha River in the east to the Hausruck range in the west. In the conflict over the succession upon the death of Emperor Charles IV in 1378, Albert joined the forces of the Luxembourg heirs Jobst of Moravia and Sigismund against the incapable king Wenceslaus and seemed a likely candidate for the German throne himself. However, he died in August 1395 while staying in his Laxenburg hunting lodge, during the preparations of a military campaign to achieve Wenceslaus&#x27; deposition which took place in 1400. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom cathedral in Vienna.

==Family and children==

Albert III was married twice. The first marriage, after 19 March 1366, was with Elisabeth of Bohemia, a daughter of the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV. This marriage was childless; his wife died at age fifteen. Afterwards, he married Beatrix of Nuremberg, a daughter of the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick V of Nuremberg and his wife Elisabeth of Meissen, a member of the House of Wettin and a descendant of the extinct Babenberg dukes of Austria.

Beatrix gave him his only son, Albert IV, who succeeded him but soon had to cede the rule over the Inner Austrian, Tyrolean and Further Austrian possessions to his Leopoldian cousins William and Leopold IV. The Albertinian line became extinct with the death of Ladislaus the Posthumous in 1457.

<doc id="1163292" wikidata="Q1699824" url="?curid=1163292" title="John Dingell Sr.">
<text>John David Dingell Sr. (February 2, 1894 – September 19, 1955) was an American politician who represented Michigan&#x27;s 15th congressional district from 1933 to 1955. He was a member of the Democratic Party. He was the father of the longest-serving member of Congress, former U.S. Representative John Dingell.

== Early life ==
Dingell was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Marie Ciesielski Opalewska and Joseph A. Dzięglewicz, who were Polish immigrants from Bączal Górny. The family&#x27;s surname ended up being anglicized to &#x27;Dingell&#x27;. A graduate of St. Casimir&#x27;s Parochial School in Detroit, he worked as a newsboy, printer and newspaperman. He had also engaged in the construction of natural gas pipelines, was a wholesale dealer in beef and pork products and an organizer and trustee of Colorado Springs Labor College.

Dingell married Grace Blossom Bigler (1894–1962) and had four children: John Jr., Patricia Ann, James, and Julè. Patricia Ann, known as Patsy, died shortly after her first birthday. Dingell established his family in Detroit, where he was employed as a printer at the Detroit Free Press and actively participated in labor union organizing. Dingell suffered from asthma and tuberculosis, which caused the family to briefly relocate to Colorado Springs to seek treatment there. There, John Jr. was born in 1926.

== Political career ==
Dingell first ran for office in 1924 when he ran for a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives from El Paso County but was defeated.

Following the 1930 U.S. Census, Michigan gained four new seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1932, Dingell was elected as a Democrat from the newly formed 15th District in western Detroit over former Mayor of Detroit Charles Bowles. He was reelected eleven times and served until his death at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., at the age of 61. He is interred at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

At the outset of his Congressional career, Dingell was a &quot;New Deal stalwart.&quot; Reflecting the prevailing prejudices of the period, a memorable letter from Dingell to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 18, 1941, suggested that ten thousand Japanese-Hawaiian Americans be incarcerated in order to ensure &quot;good behavior&quot; from Japan. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Dingell &quot;demanded that [Admiral Husband] Kimmel and [General Walter] Short be court-martialed.&quot;

== Legacy ==
After the September 19, 1955, death of the elder John Dingell, a special election called to fill the remainder of Dingell&#x27;s term was won by his son, John Jr., who took his father&#x27;s place in Congress on December 13, 1955. John Dingell Jr. retired from the House of Representatives as the longest-serving member of Congress in history at 59 years and 21 days and its longest serving Dean at 20 years on January 3, 2015, and his wife Debbie Dingell was elected to succeed him. As of 2023, the three Dingells had represented the southeastern Michigan area for 90 consecutive years.

A hallmark of their service has been a proposal for a national health insurance system, first introduced by John Sr. in 1933 and re-introduced since at every Congress by the father and then the son.

Dingell&#x27;s grandson, Christopher D. Dingell, has also taken to politics, having been elected to the Michigan State Senate in 1986.

<text>Kellen Boswell Winslow Sr. (born November 5, 1957) is an American former professional football tight end who played in the National Football League (NFL). A member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1995), he is widely recognized as one of the greatest tight ends in the league&#x27;s history. Winslow played his entire NFL career (1979–1987) with the San Diego Chargers after being selected in the first round of the 1979 NFL draft. He played college football for the Missouri Tigers, earning consensus All-American honors in 1978. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

Winslow had a late start to his football career, not playing until his senior year of high school. Noted for his unusual combination of size and speed, he was recruited by the Missouri Tigers, where he played from 1975 to 1978, ranking among the team&#x27;s reception leaders during his last two seasons. He was named All-American as a senior, entering the NFL draft as one of the highest-regarded prospects for the league.

San Diego traded up to draft Winslow with the 13th overall pick in the draft. Over the next nine seasons, he was named a first-team All-Pro three times and a Pro Bowler five times. After a promising rookie season (1979) was ended by injury, Winslow became a key figure in head coach Don Coryell&#x27;s offense from 1980 to 1983, twice leading the league in receptions. His success in the passing game had long-term effects on the usage of tight ends, who had previously been perceived as good blockers who would catch occasionally. Highlights for Winslow included a five-touchdown performance against the Oakland Raiders and a starring role in the 1981 playoff game known as the Epic in Miami.

Winslow was progressing at a record-breaking pace in 1984 when a serious knee injury knocked him out of the game for a year. He recovered enough to play from 1985 to 1987, but generally failed to recapture his pre-injury form. Winslow planned to return for a tenth year in the league but after a single appearance in the 1988 preseason the condition of his knees forced him to retire.

== Early life ==
Winslow was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, on November 5, 1957, the third of seven children. He attended East St. Louis Senior High School and did not play high school football until his senior year. Until then, he was a self-described &quot;nerd&quot; who played chess. He tried football as a sophomore, but was discouraged by two-a-days and gave it up after within a week. As a junior, he had a job with United Parcel Service (UPS) and had no time for the sport. He was convinced to try football again in his senior year by his coach, Cornelius Perry, who persuaded Winslow that it would fund his college education.

In his solitary year with the East St. Louis Flyers, Winslow caught 17 passes and was voted to the 1974 All-Southwestern Conference first team as an end. The Flyers season ended with an overtime 19–13 defeat by Glenbrook North in the championship game; a tearful Winslow blamed himself after failing to make a difficult catch in the end zone on the game&#x27;s penultimate play.

== College career ==
The University of Missouri recruited Winslow to play football for the Tigers; head coach Al Onofrio described him as &quot;the best looking future prospect on the East side.&quot; Winslow theorized that he had been recruited chiefly because of his size, as his high school statistics had been unremarkable. He played primarily in the junior varsity team in his first year, then saw some action with the Tigers as a sophomore.

Winslow had an increased impact as a junior, increasing his total receptions from 16 to 25. He was a consensus pick for tight end in the 1977 All-Big Eight first team. Entering his senior year, an associated press (AP) article described him as &quot;probably the best player&quot; awaiting new head coach Warren Powers; Powers said of Winslow, &quot;his kind don&#x27;t come along very often.&quot; He went on to catch 29 passes in 1978, being voted a consensus All-American and second team all-Big Eight. He finished his college career with 71 receptions for 1,089 yards and 10 touchdowns. In his final game as a Tiger, he added a further touchdown and Missouri defeated Louisiana State University 20–15 in the 1978 Liberty Bowl.

Winslow&#x27;s college achievements subsequently brought him numerous honors—he has been inducted into the Halls of Fame of the Missouri Tigers, Missouri Sports and College Football. The Tigers retired his No. 83 jersey.

== Professional career ==

=== NFL draft ===

Winslow entered the 1979 NFL draft rated as &quot;unquestionably the best prospect at tight end&quot; by analyst Don Heinrich. Chicago Bears general manager Jim Finks said, &quot;Some people can play tight end with two of the three requirements. I hear Winslow has all three—size, speed and strength.&quot; Winslow was expected to be chosen early in the first round, with the Kansas City Chiefs (drafting No. 2 overall) and the Cincinnati Bengals (No. 3 overall) both likely destinations.

In the event, Winslow was unexpectedly yet to be chosen by the time the draft reached the Cleveland Browns who had selection No. 13. At that point the San Diego Chargers, who were not scheduled to pick until No. 20, made a deal with Cleveland to move up seven places and select Winslow. The Chargers were delighted with the trade, as they had rated Winslow as the top player in the draft, and had twice unsuccessfully tried to trade up into the top seven picks to get him. Head coach Don Coryell explained that the Chargers had an area of need at tight end, as their current starters Bob Klein and Pat Curran were both in their 30&#x27;s and likely to retire soon. Winslow himself had expected to go to Cincinnati but was pleased when the Chargers selected him as he liked to catch the ball and was aware of Coryell&#x27;s affinity for the passing game.

=== 1979 season ===
Less than three weeks after the draft, Winslow signed a series of one-year contracts to play for the Chargers. Coryell described him as &quot;a big strong man who has great potential and ability,&quot; and suggested Winslow could play both tight end and wide receiver. When the season began, Winslow did serve in both roles, being both the second tight end behind Klein and a third wide receiver behind Charlie Joiner and John Jefferson depending on the formation. He caught his first career touchdown in week 2 of his rookie season on a 5-yard pass from quarterback Dan Fouts. When an injury to Klein forced Winslow into the starting line-up, he responded with a seven-catch performance that left him as the Chargers&#x27; leader in receptions. The following week, he lost a key fumble in a 7–0 defeat to the Denver Broncos. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article described him as inconsistent, both as a blocker and a receiver, and &quot;like a runaway locomotive without tracks&quot; when carrying the ball.

Winslow&#x27;s season ended in a week 7 game against the Seattle Seahawks due to a fractured left fibula. While he was initially projected to be out for only six weeks, Winslow was still missing for the Chargers&#x27; season-ending playoff loss to the Houston Oilers. Winslow finished with 25 catches, which had led the team at the point when he was injured, for 255 yards and two touchdowns. Winslow later believed that the injury had positive effects, saying in a 2006 interview, &quot;My breaking my leg my rookie year turned out to be a blessing, because I got a chance to sit back and look at some things... from another angle and came back my second year and things really made sense.&quot;

=== 1980 season ===

Winslow entered the 1980 season with a chance to claim the number one tight end position, as Klein retired during the offseason. Due to a series of minor injuries, Winslow was unable to win the place in preseason, with Greg McCrary beginning the regular season as the starter. In week 2, Winslow had a breakthrough performance against the Oakland Raiders with 9 catches for 132 yards and a touchdown in an overtime win. Coryell used Winslow in various positions and formations throughout the game, trying to force a mismatches where the 6 foot 5 Winslow would be covered by a smaller defender.

As the season progressed, Winslow established himself as a key component of the Air Coryell offense and eventually led the league with 89 catches, setting a new NFL record for tight ends by breaking the previous mark of 75 held by Mike Ditka. He became the first tight end to exceed 1,000 receiving yards since Jackie Smith in 1967. Some sources credit Winslow&#x27;s 1,290 yards as having set a new tight end record. He was instrumental in the Chargers&#x27; second consecutive AFC West division title, and was voted both a Pro Bowler and first-team AP All-Pro.

Winslow caught only a single pass in San Diego&#x27;s first playoff game, a 20–14 divisional playoffs victory over the Buffalo Bills. This was partially due to an injury to McCrary early in the game. The Chargers frequently used a two-tight end formation, with McCrary lining up as a regular tight end and Winslow appearing in variable positions, often going in motion. They had no backup to McCrary, so Winslow was forced to replace him as a conventional tight end, with far less scope to catch passes. McCrary attempted to play through the injury the following week, but Winslow still had only 3 catches for 42 yards, and San Diego lost the AFC Championship game 34–27 to Oakland.

=== 1981 season: Acclaimed performance in Miami ===
The 1981 season began slowly for Winslow, with only five catches in the first two games. He drew more double coverage after Jefferson was traded to the Green Bay Packers; Winslow also theorized that teams were more aware of the threat he posed following his performances the previous year. Aided by the midseason arrival of wide receiver Wes Chandler in place of Jefferson, Winslow saw more single coverage as the season went on and produced better numbers. A highlight was a 55–21 win in Oakland when Winslow caught 13 passes for 144 yards and 5 touchdowns. The five receiving touchdowns tied an NFL single-game record that has not been surpassed , while the 13 receptions tied Lance Alworth&#x27;s franchise record. Winslow said of the performance, &quot;I just happened to get my number called today. A lot of things were going our way and they just happened to go my way in particular.&quot;

San Diego were struggling with a 6–5 record before Winslow&#x27;s five-touchdown game, but recovered to finish 10–6 and win their third consecutive AFC West title. Winslow led the league in receptions for the second consecutive season, finishing with 88 catches for 1,075 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was again named to the Pro Bowl (where he won co-MVP) and the AP All-Pro first team.
Winslow excelled in the Chargers&#x27; divisional playoff game, a 41–38 overtime win over the Miami Dolphins played in draining humidity that became known as the Epic in Miami. He had 13 catches for 166 yards and a touchdown, and blocked a potential game-winning field goal at the end of regulation time. Winslow leaped in the middle of the line to block the kick, barely deflecting the ball with the outside of his right hand: he said, &quot;&quot;For all the receptions and all the yardage, I got more satisfaction out of blocking the field goal. It was something I&#x27;d never done before. It had always been a dream of mine.&quot; His 13 receptions set a new single-game playoff record, while his yardage total was a playoff record for tight ends. He achieved these statistics despite repeatedly having to leave the game with dehydration and severe cramps; he was also treated for a pinched nerve in his shoulder and received three stitches in his lower lip. After the game, a picture of Winslow being helped off the field by his teammates became an enduring image in NFL lore.

Winslow&#x27;s performance in the Miami game was greatly praised afterwards. Hall of Fame tight end Mike Ditka said, &quot;Kellen Winslow portrayed in Miami what it takes to be great. The difference between great and good is a matter of heart. He gave a tremendous amount to help his team win one of the great games ever played.&quot; Dolphins&#x27; tackle Bob Kuechenberg said the game made Winslow&#x27;s career in a 2017 interview, adding &quot;I deeply resented the fact that they literally carried him off the field five times and he&#x27;d come back and do some other miracle.&quot; A 2012 &quot;ESPN&quot; article rated it the second-best single-game playoff performance in NFL history up to that point, while a 2014 &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; article named it the joint-best playoff performance by a Charger.

While Winslow scored again the following week, it was the Chargers&#x27; only touchdown in a 27–7 AFC Championship game loss at Cincinnati. The game became known as the Freezer Bowl for the unusually frigid and windy conditions. Winslow commented afterwards, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t send my dog out in that kind of weather.&quot;

=== 1982 season ===

The 1982 season was interrupted by a 57-day NFL players strike which reduced the regular season to nine games. Winslow expressed impatience with the process, claiming that players&#x27; union director Ed Garvey and management negotiator Jack Donlan were both on &quot;ego trips.&quot; While Garvey was seeking a wage scale for the players, Winslow believed that abolishing the NFL draft and encouraging the development of the rival United States Football League (USFL) would do more to increase their salaries. On the field, his success continued—Winslow&#x27;s 54 receptions were the most in the AFC, while his 721 yards were second to his teammate Chandler. For the third consecutive season, he was named both a Pro Bowler and AP first-team All-Pro.

San Diego qualified for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, taking their place in an expanded 16-team Super Bowl tournament as the AFC&#x27;s fifth seed and travelling to the Pittsburgh Steelers for their first game. The Steelers led 28–17 in the final quarter, but two touchdowns by Winslow gave San Diego a 31–28 win; he had 7 catches for 102 yards and the two scores. A rematch with the Dolphins in Miami followed. Winslow was unable to repeat his performance of the previous year, playing with a twisted ankle for most of the game and finishing with only one catch for 18 yards as Miami won 34–13. Winslow said of the defeat, &quot;You can say it either way: They had a great day, or we had an off day. But really it was both.&quot; It was the last playoff game of his career.

An National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) survey released after the season reported his annual salary as $210,000, joint third-most on the Chargers but behind 64 players league-wide, including some tight ends.

=== 1983 season ===
The Chargers had a disappointing 1983 season and missed the playoffs for the first time in Winslow&#x27;s career, although he himself had another statistically productive year. Winslow had 14 catches for 162 yards and 3 touchdowns in a win over the Chiefs, breaking the franchise single-game receptions record he&#x27;d previously shared with Alworth. He finished the year with 88 catches for 1,172 yards and 8 touchdowns, and was voted to another Pro Bowl, though this time as the AFC&#x27;s reserve tight end behind Todd Christensen of Los Angeles. Winslow had caught more passes than any other player over the five-year period 1979–83.

=== 1984 season: Holdout and career-threatening injury ===
Winslow entered the 1984 season seeking to renegotiate his contract. He had two years remaining on a five-year contract and a verbal agreement from Chargers ownership that he could negotiate a new deal in 1984. He requested an amount which the Chargers refused, with Winslow&#x27;s agent Jim Steiner stating shortly before the regular season started that the two sides were far apart with their offers. Steiner declared Winslow&#x27;s intention to play in week 1 at Minnesota, &quot;out of respect for the team, Don Coryell and the coaching staff,&quot; then retire if no agreement was forthcoming. On September 2 he followed through on the threat, catching four passes in the game then travelling to East St. Louis instead of flying back to San Diego with his teammates. He criticized ownership for letting players such as Jefferson and Fred Dean leave in the past due to similar contract disputes, saying &quot;I feel cheated... they&#x27;ve turned their back on me. I have nowhere else to go but home.&quot; Chargers general manager Johnny Sanders said that there would be no further negotiations with Winslow while he refused to report to camp. San Diego declined to place Winslow on the retirement list, which would have prevented him playing for the rest of the year. On September 5, Steiner suggested that Winslow could still be induced to return, but that they were investigating other means of income, including television work. The Chargers signed veteran tight end Al Dixon as a replacement on September 6. The Houston Gamblers of the USFL declared an interest in signing Winslow, staging a press conference with the player on September 8. Winslow stated at the conference that he would return to San Diego and play the remaining two years there; he was not permitted to sign for the Gamblers until his Chargers contract expired, but expressed an interest in joining them for the 1986 season. Winslow then returned to the Chargers, allowing negotiations to re-open. On September 12, Winslow agreed to a new five-year contract with San Diego.

Winslow had missed one game due to his holdout, but returned in week 3 to face the Oilers at home. The Jack Murphy Stadium crowd booed him when he was announced at the start of the game, a 31–14 victory in which he had 10 catches for 146 yards. Three weeks later, he broke the Chargers single-game receptions record for the second time with 15 catches for 157 yards in a 34–28 win at Green Bay. Despite having missed a game, he was on course to break Charley Hennigan&#x27;s league record of 101 catches in a season before being stopped by a serious knee injury.
In week 8, late in a 44–37 loss to the Raiders, Winslow took a short pass over the middle for his 55th reception of the season. His knee twisted while being tackled by Los Angeles linebackers Jeff Barnes and Rod Martin. In the immediate wake of the injury, Winslow described himself as &quot;flopping on the field like a flounder out of water.&quot; Once medical staff reset his knee, Winslow smiled and exchanged jokes with the Raiders as he left the field, but learned in the treatment room that his injury would require season-ending surgery after the game. Team physician Gary Losse, who performed the surgery over the course of two hours, later said that Winslow&#x27;s knee looked like &quot;spaghetti... like a couple of mop ends.&quot; Losse also said, &quot;The ligaments had almost an explosion-like appearance, it was a very, very severe knee injury.&quot; The severity was due in part to both the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being damaged. Reflecting on his season the following week, Winslow was relieved that he had insisted on a guaranteed contract during negotiations, which ensured he would be paid in full for five years even if he was unable to play again.

=== 1985 season ===
Interviewed during April 1985, Winslow reported that his recovery was proceeding ahead of schedule. He was optimistic of a midseason return in the coming season, and of again being the best tight end in the league. In August, he was placed on the physically unable to perform list. Winslow returned to action in week 7, two days short of a year after the injury happened. In a loss at the Minnesota Vikings, he caught two passes, produced key blocks on a pair of touchdown runs, and described the game as &quot;like old times.&quot; Two weeks later, he was used on only four plays in a win over Denver, all of which were running plays. He was visibly upset over his lack of usage, and failed to report for practice the next day, instead flying to Canada to promote a drink in which he had a financial stake. The following day, he returned to the team and apologised for his absence.

Winslow was used primarily as a blocker or decoy throughout the season, and finished with only 25 catches for 318 yards and no touchdowns from his ten appearances. Compared with his play before the injury, Winslow struggled to break tackles and change directions sharply when running pass routes. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ll never be the Kellen Winslow of old. There will always be something missing because of the reconstruction.&quot;

=== 1986 season ===

Winslow improved in 1986, catching 64 passes for 728 yards and 5 touchdowns, with 45 of his catches coming in the final nine games. Offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese described his movement as more fluid and his play as more confident. Winslow would later describe his own play as still being tentative and scared during the 1986 season.

=== 1987 season ===
During the offseason Winslow underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee to clear out scar tissue from his injury; he reported improved running ability afterwards. The 1987 season was shortened by a players strike, which saw one week cancelled and three more played primarily with replacement players. Winslow sat out the entire strike, which he described as frustrating. He taped over his jersey number during a training session in protest at his No. 80 being used by one of the replacement players.

On the field, Winslow was pleased to find that he was that he was better at breaking tackles than the previous year. His play after the strike prompted his new head coach Al Saunders to say that he was once again playing at a league-leading standard. Winslow made his 500th career reception during the season, following Ozzie Newsome as the second tight end to pass the landmark. He finished with 53 catches from his twelve games, second-most among NFL tights ends, though his 9.8 yards per reception was the least of his career. His performances earned him his fifth Pro Bowl nomination (his first since the knee injury) and a place in the AP All-Pro second team, while his teammates named him their offensive player of the year. He said that during the year he had accomplished &quot;the regaining of respect, both on this team and around the league... a resurgence to the level a lot of people wondered I could still play at.&quot;

=== 1988 season: Suspension and retirement ===
Winslow expected to continue his career in 1988, though he hinted it might be his last season, reporting that the Chargers did not seem eager to extend his contract. Entering the season at 30 years old, he was the second-longest tenured Charger, behind only center Don Macek. He again had arthroscopic surgery during the offseason, and failed one physical before passing a second one and joining his teammates at training camp in August. He was unable to play in the Chargers&#x27; first two preseason games and featured briefly in the third. Subsequently, he had to leave training early on consecutive days, missed a third day entirely, and was ruled out of the final preseason game due to his knee. Saunders said, &quot;It&#x27;s just not coming around. It&#x27;s concerning him and I know it&#x27;s concerning us.&quot;

On August 29, Winslow announced to journalists that he had been suspended without pay by the Chargers following a meeting with team officials. Describing his physical state during his preseason appearance as &quot;total ineptness,&quot; Winslow said he had informed Saunders and director of football operations Steve Ortmayer that he was unable to continue his career. The Chargers maintained that he was fit to play having passed a physical, and had been suspended for refusing to do so. This caused a dispute as to whether Winslow should be paid his guaranteed salary of $795,000 for the coming season. He would forfeit the money if he officially retired; the Chargers offered him half the amount to retire, which Winslow refused. Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, supported Winslow—he said that the Chargers had suspended their player while citing an outdated collective bargaining agreement, and that the NFLPA intended to file a lawsuit against the team. Winslow also threatened litigation, but instead decided to wait while Steiner negotiated with Ortmayer to find a compromise retirement settlement.
On September 30, the two sides reached agreement and Winslow&#x27;s retirement became official. The terms of the agreement were not revealed. Winslow was critical of the Chargers&#x27; handling of the situation, saying that they had stripped him of his dignity by imposing the suspension. Ortmayer responded that there no should be no negative connotations to being placed on the suspended players list, as the NFL required all players on the roster to be given one of the available designations.

Interviewed the following year, Winslow described his career as &quot;like a fairy tale,&quot; saying that he had been fortunate with his choice of high school and college, and with having a head coach in Coryell who could best exploit his abilities.

=== Legacy ===

Through his nine years in the NFL, Winslow caught 541 passes for 6,741 yards and 45 touchdowns in the regular season. His receptions total ranked 14th in league history at the time of his retirement. Winslow played in five Pro Bowls, and was named to three AP All-Pro first teams and one second team. Further honors followed his retirement, as he was voted into the NFL&#x27;s All-1980s team, 75th anniversary team, and 100th anniversary team. In 1995, Winslow was inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Chargers Hall of Fame; the Chargers retired his No. 80 jersey in 2023.
Winslow is widely recognized as one of the best to play his position, and credited with revolutionizing the usage of tight ends in the NFL. Tight ends prior to Winslow were primarily blockers who lined up next to an offensive lineman and ran short to medium routes; Winslow said upon being drafted, &quot;I can get just as deep as wide receivers and just as fast,&quot; and Coryell quickly identified him as someone who could line up as a wide receiver on some plays and a tight end on others. As his career progressed, the Chargers would use Winslow unpredictably in a number of positions over the course of a game, including flanker, split end, slotback, H-back, wingback or conventional tight end. He might start the play in a three point blocking stance or a two point receiver&#x27;s stance, or be put in motion so he would not be jammed at the line.

Winslow was credited with creating the H-back position by Joe Bugel, an offensive coordinator with the Washington teams who made use of H-backs to win multiple Super Bowls. He said, &quot;It takes the complete athlete, a guy who can block an end or a linebacker or take a cornerback or strong safety deep.&quot; Saunders described Winslow as &quot;a wide receiver in an offensive lineman&#x27;s body,&quot; while Coryell said, &quot;If we&#x27;re asking Kellen to block a defensive end and not catch passes, I&#x27;m not a very good coach.&quot; Former head coach Jon Gruden called Winslow the first &quot;joker&quot; in the NFL. Head coach Bill Belichick noted that the pass-catching tight ends who get paid the most money are &quot;all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow&quot; and that there were fewer tight ends in the 21st century who could block on the line. Winslow himself credited Coryell and his coaching staff for thinking outside the box to utilize his abilities in new ways: &quot;There were many athletes before me who could do the things that I did. You talk about Charlie Sanders... Could stand in there and hold his own. Could run good routes. Probably could split him out. But I came into a situation with the offensive system where I could do those things.&quot;

He called the coin toss at the pregame ceremony at Super Bowl XXIX between the Chargers and the San Francisco 49ers, which was done by then-Congressman Steve Largent on behalf of the surviving members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 1995 (the other survivor was Lee Roy Selmon) and 75th Anniversary Team members Otto Graham, Gale Sayers, Mean Joe Greene and Ray Nitschke (representing PBHOF Class of 1995 member Henry Jordan).

Lists of the top 100 NFL players at any position frequently feature Winslow: In 1999, he was ranked No. 73 by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, a 2010 &quot;NFL Network&quot; series had him at No. 67, and a panel of &quot;USA Today&quot; journalists placed him at No. 79 in 2019.

== Personal life ==
In the immediate wake of his retirement, Winslow served as marketing vice president and major stockholder for a San Diego-based nutrition company. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of San Diego in 1993 and spent some time as a sports agent, while doubling as a radio commentator for his alma mater the Missouri Tigers. Later, he worked as a college football announcer with Fox Sports Net. Winslow served in various sports administrator roles, having been athletic director at Central State University, vice president for athletics and wellness at Lakeland College, and director of athletics at Florida A&amp;M University.

Winslow has been married twice. He has two sons, Kellen II with his first wife and Justin Winslow with his then-girlfriend. Kellen II also played tight end in the NFL.

Winslow has been a vocal proponent of affirmative action, particularly in football—he dedicated a substantial section of his Hall of Fame induction speech to highlighting the lack of African Americans in non-playing roles. When his son announced his intention to sign with the University of Washington, Winslow objected as the coaching staff featured no African Americans; Winslow II eventually signed with the University of Miami instead. Winslow described this as “a black father teaching his black son about the ways of the world.”

<text>In cell biology, protein kinase C, commonly abbreviated to PKC (EC 2.7.11.13), is a family of protein kinase enzymes that are involved in controlling the function of other proteins through the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine amino acid residues on these proteins, or a member of this family. PKC enzymes in turn are activated by signals such as increases in the concentration of diacylglycerol (DAG) or calcium ions (Ca2+). Hence PKC enzymes play important roles in several signal transduction cascades.

In biochemistry, the PKC family consists of fifteen isozymes in humans. They are divided into three subfamilies, based on their second messenger requirements: conventional (or classical), novel, and atypical. Conventional (c)PKCs contain the isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ. These require Ca2+, DAG, and a phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine for activation. Novel (n)PKCs include the δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms, and require DAG, but do not require Ca2+ for activation. Thus, conventional and novel PKCs are activated through the same signal transduction pathway as phospholipase C. On the other hand, atypical (a)PKCs (including protein kinase Mζ and ι / λ isoforms) require neither Ca2+ nor diacylglycerol for activation. The term &quot;protein kinase C&quot; usually refers to the entire family of isoforms. The different classes of PKCs found in jawed vertebrates originate from 5 ancestral PKC family members (PKN, aPKC, cPKC, nPKCE, nPKCD) that expanded due to genome duplication. The broader PKC family is ancient and can be found back in fungi, which means that the PKC family was present in the last common ancestor of opisthokonts.

== Structure ==
The structure of all PKCs consists of a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain (active site) tethered together by a hinge region. The catalytic region is highly conserved among the different isoforms, as well as, to a lesser degree, among the catalytic region of other serine/threonine kinases. The second messenger requirement differences in the isoforms are a result of the regulatory region, which are similar within the classes, but differ among them. Most of the crystal structure of the catalytic region of PKC has not been determined, except for PKC theta and iota. Due to its similarity to other kinases whose crystal structure have been determined, the structure can be strongly predicted.

=== Regulatory ===
The regulatory domain or the amino-terminus of the PKCs contains several shared subregions. The C1 domain, present in all of the isoforms of PKC has a binding site for DAG as well as non-hydrolysable, non-physiological analogues called phorbol esters. This domain is functional and capable of binding DAG in both conventional and novel isoforms, however, the C1 domain in atypical PKCs is incapable of binding to DAG or phorbol esters. The C2 domain acts as a Ca2+ sensor and is present in both conventional and novel isoforms, but functional as a Ca2+ sensor only in the conventional. The pseudosubstrate region, which is present in all three classes of PKC, is a small sequence of amino acids that mimic a substrate and bind the substrate-binding cavity in the catalytic domain, lack critical serine, threonine phosphoacceptor residues, keeping the enzyme inactive. When Ca2+ and DAG are present in sufficient concentrations, they bind to the C2 and C1 domain, respectively, and recruit PKC to the membrane. This interaction with the membrane results in release of the pseudosubstrate from the catalytic site and activation of the enzyme. In order for these allosteric interactions to occur, however, PKC must first be properly folded and in the correct conformation permissive for catalytic action. This is contingent upon phosphorylation of the catalytic region, discussed below.

=== Catalytic ===
The catalytic region or kinase core of the PKC allows for different functions to be processed; PKB (also known as Akt) and PKC kinases contains approximately 40% amino acid sequence similarity. This similarity increases to ~ 70% across PKCs and even higher when comparing within classes. For example, the two atypical PKC isoforms, ζ and ι/λ, are 84% identical (Selbie et al., 1993). Of the over-30 protein kinase structures whose crystal structure has been revealed, all have the same basic organization. They are a bilobal structure with a β sheet comprising the N-terminal lobe and an α helix constituting the C-terminal lobe. Both the ATP-binding protein (ATP)- and the substrate-binding sites are located in the cleft formed by these two terminal lobes. This is also where the pseudosubstrate domain of the regulatory region binds.

Another feature of the PKC catalytic region that is essential to the viability of the kinase is its phosphorylation. The conventional and novel PKCs have three phosphorylation sites, termed: the activation loop, the turn motif, and the hydrophobic motif. The atypical PKCs are phosphorylated only on the activation loop and the turn motif. Phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif is rendered unnecessary by the presence of a glutamic acid in place of a serine, which, as a negative charge, acts similar in manner to a phosphorylated residue. These phosphorylation events are essential for the activity of the enzyme, and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) is the upstream kinase responsible for initiating the process by transphosphorylation of the activation loop.

The consensus sequence of protein kinase C enzymes is similar to that of protein kinase A, since it contains basic amino acids close to the Ser/Thr to be phosphorylated. Their substrates are, e.g., MARCKS proteins, MAP kinase, transcription factor inhibitor IκB, the vitamin D3 receptor VDR, Raf kinase, calpain, and the epidermal growth factor receptor.

==Activation==
Upon activation, protein kinase C enzymes are translocated to the plasma membrane by RACK proteins (membrane-bound receptor for activated protein kinase C proteins). This localization also gives the enzyme access to substrate, an activation mechanism termed substrate presentation. The protein kinase C enzymes are known for their long-term activation: They remain activated after the original activation signal or the Ca2+-wave is gone. It is presumed that this is achieved by the production of diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol by a phospholipase; fatty acids may also play a role in long-term activation. A critical part of PKC activation is translocation to the cell membrane. Interestingly, this process is disrupted in microgravity, which causes immunodeficiency of astronauts.

== Function == 
A multiplicity of functions have been ascribed to PKC. Recurring themes are that PKC is involved in receptor desensitization, in modulating membrane structure events, in regulating transcription, in mediating immune responses, in regulating cell growth, and in learning and memory. PKC isoforms have been designated &quot;memory kinases,&quot; and deficits in PKC signaling in neurons is an early abnormality in the brains of patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. These functions are achieved by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of other proteins. PKC plays an important role in the immune system through phosphorylation of CARD-CC family proteins and subsequent NF-κB activation. However, the substrate proteins present for phosphorylation vary, since protein expression is different between different kinds of cells. Thus, effects of PKC are cell-type-specific:

== Pathology ==
Protein kinase C, activated by tumor promoter phorbol ester, may phosphorylate potent activators of transcription, and thus lead to increased expression of oncogenes, promoting cancer progression, or interfere with other phenomena. Prolonged exposure to phorbol ester, however, promotes the down-regulation of Protein kinase C. Loss-of-function mutations and low PKC protein levels are prevalent in cancer, supporting a general tumor-suppressive role for Protein kinase C.

Protein kinase C enzymes are important mediators of vascular permeability and have been implicated in various vascular diseases including disorders associated with hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus, as well as endothelial injury and tissue damage related to cigarette smoke. Low-level PKC activation is sufficient to reverse cell chirality through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling and alters junctional protein organization between cells with opposite chirality, leading to an unexpected substantial change in endothelial permeability, which often leads to inflammation and disease.

== Inhibitors ==
Protein kinase C inhibitors, such as ruboxistaurin, may potentially be beneficial in peripheral diabetic nephropathy.

Chelerythrine is a natural &quot;selective&quot; PKC inhibitor. Other naturally occurring PKCIs are miyabenol C, myricitrin, gossypol.

Bryostatin 1 can act as a PKC inhibitor; It was investigated for cancer.

Darovasertib is an investigational new drug in efficacy trials in treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. 

Other PKCIs include Verbascoside, BIM-1, Ro31-8220, and Tamoxifen.

==Activators==
The Protein kinase C activator ingenol mebutate, derived from the plant &quot;Euphorbia peplus&quot;, is FDA-approved for the treatment of actinic keratosis.

Bryostatin 1 can act as a PKCe activator and as of 2016 is being investigated for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA or TPA) is a diacylglycerol mimic that can activate the classical PKCs. It is often used together with ionomycin which provides the calcium-dependent signals needed for activation of some PKCs.

<doc id="1163297" wikidata="Q629164" url="?curid=1163297" title="Beatles VI">
<text>Beatles VI is the seventh Capitol Records studio album by the English rock band the Beatles in the United States and Canada (including &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot;). It was the ninth album released into that market in less than one and a half years (Vee-Jay Records and United Artists Records also released one album each during that period). The LP was released in both mono and stereo versions.

&quot;Beatles VI&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; for six weeks, beginning on 10 July 1965.

This LP was also released in New Zealand in stereo in time for Christmas 1966. The pressing plates were obtained from EMI (UK) and are identical to their export-release. The title on the record label erroneously reads &quot;Beatles IV&quot;, and the catalogue number is PCSM 6042.
&quot;Beatles VI&quot; is available on CD as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 2&quot; box set in both stereo and mono mixes (catalogue number CDP 0946 3 57499 2 2.) In 2014, &quot;Beatles VI&quot; was issued on CD again, individually and as part of &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot; boxed set.

==Music==
&quot;Beatles VI&quot; includes two tracks featuring searing John Lennon vocals, recorded specifically for the North American market: &quot;Bad Boy&quot; and &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot;, both covers of Larry Williams songs, and both recorded on Williams&#x27; birthday (10 May 1965), marking perhaps the only time that the Beatles recorded material especially for North America. &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot; was part of the set of their 1965 US concerts and was soon included on the British release of the &quot;Help!&quot; album, but &quot;Bad Boy&quot; was not released in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world until 1966, when it appeared on the compilation &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot;. These two songs, along with &quot;Act Naturally&quot; the following month, were the last cover songs recorded and released by the Beatles until &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; appeared on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970.

&quot;Beatles VI&quot; also included:
* the remaining six tracks from &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; (i.e., those left off &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;, although two such songs had been released on a single in February 1965).
* &quot;Yes It Is&quot;, the B-side to the single &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;. This is a &quot;duophonic&quot; stereo remix from the original mono track, with additional echo and reverb.
* two other tracks from the forthcoming UK release of &quot;Help!&quot;: &quot;You Like Me Too Much&quot; and &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;.

As on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, the &quot;Kansas City&quot;/&quot;Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!&quot; medley was originally listed only as &quot;Kansas City&quot;. After attorneys for Venice Music notified Capitol of its error, the record label was soon corrected, although the album cover never was.
==Track listing==

==Charts and certifications==

In the U.S., the album sold 899,025 copies by 31 December 1965 and 1,094,707 copies by the end of the decade.

<doc id="1163301" wikidata="Q7335052" url="?curid=1163301" title="Rinker Group">
<text>The Rinker Group was an Australian-headquartered multinational building products company. Before its acquisition by Cemex, it was listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

The business was on-sold by Cemex to Holcim in 2009 and now operates under the banner of Holcim (Australia) Pty Ltd.

==Divisions==
Rinker operated three major divisions:

* Readymix, which produced and delivered bulk concrete and quarried rock and sand for the building industry for the Australian market. Readymix had established subsidiaries in China, supplying concrete for the cities of Tianjin and Qingdao.
* Humes, a manufacturer of concrete products including pipe, rail track materials, precast concrete bridges, culverts and the like, for the Australian market. Humes is still a major player in this market as a subsidiary of Holcim Australia.
* Rinker Materials Corporation of West Palm Beach produces several concrete, aggregate, and other heavy building products similar to the Australian product line in several US states, notably including Florida and Arizona. In Florida, for instance, it operated under the name &quot;Florida Materials&quot;, and ran a substantial retail network for these materials and other building products. About 80% of Rinker&#x27;s revenue and profits came from its US operations.

==History==
Rinker Group was established as a separate entity in 2003 through its demerger from CSR Limited. CSR had earlier purchased Rinker Materials, which was founded by Marshall &quot;Doc&quot; Rinker and A.V. Hansen in 1926. The company has approximately 14,000 employees and as of 2004 has sales of around US$3,700 million and a market capitalization of about US$5 billion. Its net profit was US$492 million in the 2003-04 financial year.

In the Companies Target Statement over Cemex&#x27;s takeover bid they showed the group&#x27;s result from 98 (they were at this time owned by Commonwealth Sugar Refineries). They revealed that the compound average growth rate for EBITDA is 24.8 while sales grew at 14.3% average compound. Taking these figures it&#x27;s evident that in nine fiscal years, their EBITDA margin has doubled from 14% to 28%. This means on average over the last 9 years 32.9% of any amount that sales grow by (14.3%) will result in 32.9% sales growth directly translated into EBITDA.

Rinker Group was acquired by CEMEX, the world&#x27;s third-largest cement producer, through its subsidiary CEMEX Australia Pty Ltd. in a US$14.2 billion takeover bid. As of June 2007, CEMEX owned a 67.3% stake in Rinker Group. The chief executive officer was David Clarke, who had long worked in CSR&#x27;s heavy building products division. The chairman of the board of directors was Hector Medina, executive vice-president of CEMEX. The other board members were also nominees from CEMEX.

CEMEX Australia was sold to Holcim in June 2009 as part of an AUD 2 billion takeover bid and is now known as Holcim Australia.
The deal included the Readymix and Humes business units and CEMEX&#x27;s 25% stake in Cement Australia (one of Australia&#x27;s major cement manufacturers) but did not include the US-based Rinker Materials Corporation. In 2016, Cemex sold its Rinker Materials pipe business to Quikrete.

The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters are located in Chatswood, a Sydney suburb.

<doc id="1163308" wikidata="Q614514" url="?curid=1163308" title="Goseki Kojima">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist. He is known for his collaborations with manga writer Kazuo Koike, the most famous of them being &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;.

==Biography==
Kojima was born in Yokkaichi, Mie, on the same day as Osamu Tezuka. After getting out of junior high school, Kojima painted advertising posters for movie theaters as his source of income.

In 1950, he moved to Tokyo. The post-World War II environment led to forms of manga meant for impoverished audiences. Kojima created art for &quot;kamishibai&quot; or &quot;paper play&quot; narrators. Kojima then started to create works for the &quot;kashi-bon&quot; market but soon started working as an assistant of manga artist Sanpei Shirato. In 1957, he made his manga artist debut with &quot;Onmitsu Kuroyoden&quot;.

In 1967, Kojima created the ninja adventure &quot;Dojinki&quot;, his first manga for a magazine. In 1970, he and writer Kazuo Koike created &quot;Kozure Okami&quot; (&quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;), the first and most famous of their four major collaborations. Koike and Kojima were dubbed &quot;the Golden Duo&quot;.

In his later years, Kojima adapted some of the films of his favorite director, Akira Kurosawa, into graphic novels. Kojima died on January 5, 2000, at the age of 71.
