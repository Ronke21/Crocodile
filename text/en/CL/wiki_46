<text>The Battle of Angamos () was a naval encounter of the War of the Pacific fought between the navies of Chile and Perú at Punta Angamos, on 8 October 1879. The battle was the culminating point of a naval campaign that lasted about five months in which the Chilean Navy had the sole mission of eliminating its Peruvian counterpart. In the struggle, two armored frigates, led by Commodore Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas and Navy Captain Juan José Latorre battered and later captured the Peruvian monitor &quot;Huáscar&quot;, under Rear Admiral Miguel Grau Seminario.

After the loss of the frigate &quot;Independencia&quot; at Punta Gruesa, Grau sought to challenge the outnumbering Chilean fleet with a harassing strategy, focused on inflicting as much damage as possible while avoiding a full-scale engagement. As Grau moved along the Pacific coast, he was chased by Admiral John Williams Rebolledo, who had been ordered to catch Grau no matter what. His failure cost him his commission, and was replaced by Riveros.

With a different strategy, Riveros managed to encircle Grau at Punta Angamos, about 80 kilometers north of Antofagasta. Falling in a trap set by Riveros and Latorre, Grau was forced to present battle after ordering the corvette &quot;Unión&quot; to escape to Perú.

Latorre, aboard &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot;, engaged first. Taking advantage of the powerful Armstrong-type batteries with armour-piercing projectiles, Latorre shelled &quot;Huáscar&quot; for almost two hours. The monitor &quot;Huascar&quot;, with only ordinary elongated shot, could cause little damage to the Chilean ironclads and Grau was killed in action. However, his flagship continued the fight, while Riveros engaged her with the &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; as well. After being battered for almost three hours, the &quot;Huáscar&quot;, unable to sustain combat, was boarded and captured and the battle ended.

The result was a complete success for the Chilean Navy, and secured its dominant position for the rest of the war. It allowed to prepare the invasion of the Tarapacá department, carried out on early November.

Chilean Navy dominance off the Pacific coast contributed significantly to success in the following land campaigns across the Atacama Desert that ended with Lima&#x27;s fall in January 1881.

The &quot;Huáscar&quot; was repaired and served under the Chilean flag until its decommission, and now sits as a floating museum in the port of Talcahuano.

== Background ==

After the naval battle of Iquique of 21 May, the Peruvian fleet lost the armored frigate &quot;Independencia&quot; to a wooden schooner, &quot;Covadonga&quot;. This obliged Rear Admiral Miguel Grau to renounce to attack and to adopt a harassing strategy, avoiding by all means a direct encounter with the bulk of the Chilean navy.

Aboard the monitor &quot;Huáscar&quot;, Grau made several incursions into Chilean waters, successfully challenging the enemy&#x27;s domination along the coast. Under his command, &quot;Huáscar&quot; sank or captured 14 transports, one of them carrying an entire cavalry regiment.

This last setback was considered a humiliation by the Chilean public opinion, and sparked several protests against the government. Besides, the Commander of the Chilean fleet Juan Williams Rebolledo resigned on 5 August. His poor command left his ships incapable of sailing without important repairs. The Chileans lost almost a month restoring the vessels to combat condition again. Therefore, the newly appointed Commander of the Navy, Commodore Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas, couldn&#x27;t sail until September.

By 30 September, Riveros was notified that the corvette &quot;Unión&quot; was sailing to Panamá to escort five small ships with torpedoes bought from the United States. The Chilean fleet sailed again on 1 October, now carrying War Minister Rafael Sotomayor. The preceding week, the government had ordered the fleet to hunt down the &quot;Huáscar&quot; at all cost. In a council held aboard Riveros&#x27; flagship, the armored frigate &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;, it was decided to set course to Arica, hoping to find &quot;Huáscar&quot; there.

But, on 7 October, Riveros was informed that Grau had been sighted sailing north at Coquimbo, halfway between Arica and Valparaíso. Therefore, a new strategy was set up to capture the Peruvian monitor.

Divided in two divisions, Riveros with the slower ships would move close to shore, while Latorre would sail about 35 km from shore with the faster ships. So, the fleet was divided as it follows:

* 1st Division—Commodore Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas.
**Armored frigate &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;: Commodore Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas
**Wooden schooner &quot;Virgen de Covadonga&quot;: Lt. Captain Manuel Orella
**Transport &quot;Matias Cousiño&quot; : Lt. Captain Augusto Castleton.
* 2nd Division—Commander Juan Jose Latorre
**Armored frigate : Commander Juan Jose Latorre
**Corvette &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&quot; : Lt. Captain Jorge Montt Alvarez
**Gunned Transport &quot;Loa&quot; : Lt. Captain Javier Molinas Gacitua.

=== Chilean strategy ===
On 1 October, Riveros gathered his officers and communicated the order of hunting down the Peruvian vessel at Arica. The same day, Grau in his flagship &quot;Huáscar&quot; ordered to sail along the coast as far south as Coquimbo, accompanied by the corvette &quot;Unión&quot;. Since the Chilean fleet sailed close to the shore and the Peruvians were farther out in the open sea, both formations didn&#x27;t spot each other.

At Mejillones, on 7 October, a plan was approved to deceive the Peruvian ships. Riveros&#x27; division would wait for Grau at Antofagasta while Latorre would set up an east–west barrier-like formation about from shore. If Riveros could spot &quot;Huáscar&quot;, he would follow and keep her from retreating to south until Latorre could engage.

During the night the Peruvian warships were sailing off the Chilean coast to Arica, when they saw the lights of Antofagasta. Admiral Grau decided to engage any Chilean vessel at the port, intending to inflict some damage.

At 01:10 h. on 8 October, &quot;Huáscar&quot; searched the bay without encountering any targets. She came up with &quot;Unión&quot; at 03:00 hrs, and both resumed their northward heading. At the same hour, lookouts on &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; saw two smoke columns on the horizon. Simultaneously, Grau was informed that there were three smoke columns to north.

Both enemies spotted each other and the Peruvian ships turned back south. Riveros ordered a speed reduction of his to make Grau think it was possible to turn back north and sail for Perú. At 05:40 h., both Peruvian ships began to slowly turn once again north. Then, Riveros increased the speed of &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; to get closer to the Peruvians and to discourage Grau from turning back south.

At 07:15 hrs, steaming northward, the two Peruvian vessels spotted smoke columns ahead; it was the incoming Latorre&#x27;s division. Since the Peruvian &quot;Unión&quot; could manage 13 knots, she was able to sail northeastward and escape, but the &quot;Huáscar&quot; had to maintain course and fight.

==The Struggle==

Around 8:30 h, the gap between &quot;Huáscar&quot; and &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; reduced to 3,000 meters, and after Latorre modified his route, &quot;Cochrane&quot; was closing in too.

Off Punta Angamos at 09:25 h. Grau opened fire over &quot;Cochrane&quot;, beginning the engagement. Latorre didn&#x27;t answer, focused on approaching to &quot;Huáscar&quot; from its stern. About 15 minutes later, &quot;Cochrane&quot; retaliated from about 2,200 meters. Her three starboard cannons caused serious damage to the monitor right from the start. The very first shot pierced &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s turret, wounding the twelve crew members manning the 300-pound cannons. Another shot perforated the armor just above the waterline, cutting the left rudder chain and leaving &quot;Huáscar&quot; temporarily adrift. Meanwhile, &quot;Cochrane&quot; sustained little damage. Grau&#x27;s flagship listed hard to starboard and was hampered also by a deformation in the hull acquired when she rammed Prat&#x27;s &quot;Esmeralda&quot; at Iquique five months ago. However, barely ten minutes later an emergency rudder was set up by &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s crew.

At 10:00 h, a shot from &quot;Cochrane&quot; struck the bridge cabin, killing Admiral Grau and his adjutant, Diego Ferre. Command fell to Captain Elías Aguirre. By this time &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s stern was on fire since at least two more shells penetrated from the rear and shattered the rudder wheel (Cluny, pg. 230), and the forecastle was devastated too. Lt. Captain Gaona&#x27;s gunners caused heavy casualties among the Peruvian crew: the Chileans were using Palliser type armor-piercing rounds, which exploded right after penetrating the hull.

At 10:10, the &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s flag was brought down from its hoist by the intense gunfire. Latorre ordered a cease fire, thinking that the ship had surrendered. However, the monitor kept up its pace and within minutes an unidentified officer hoisted the flag again, resuming combat. Meanwhile, the crew of the &quot;Huascar&quot; had again repaired the rudder wheel.

At 10:22 hrs, &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; arrived to the fray. A shot from 200 meters perforated the &quot;Huascar&quot;&#x27;s turret, killing almost all of the sailors within and damaging the rightmost cannon. Another shot from &quot;Cochrane&quot; passed through the officers&#x27; quarters and wrecked the emergency rudder station, which had been disabled already twice before. The &quot;Huáscar&quot; now could sail only in a wide semicircle to starboard. Once rudder control was regained, Aguirre tried to ram the &quot;Cochrane&quot;. Latorre was also maneuvering to ram the &quot;Huáscar&quot;, but the Peruvian ironclad suddenly veered to port and both ships passed by each other. Another projectile pierced &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s turret 12 minutes later, killing everyone inside, including Captain Aguirre. Command of the ship went to Lt. Pedro Garezon, who in conference with the remaining officers decided to scuttle the ship rather than allow it to be captured. At 10:54 hrs the order was given to evacuate the wounded from the engine room and open the main condensator to scuttle the ship and to prevent its capture.

At 10:55 hrs &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s flag chain was caught (a second time) by the intense gunfire. The Chilean warships, noticing that the &quot;Huáscar&quot; was decreasing speed, mustered their boarding parties. At 11:08 hrs, 14 to 20 sailors boarded the &quot;Huáscar&quot;, without resistance. They closed the main condensator water leaks (with 1.2 meters of water in the engine room) and extinguished several fires while the prisoners were transported to the Chilean vessels. Acting commander Pedro Garezon pointed out to the Chilean officers that the flag was on deck together with the chain because they had all been cut off by the enemy shots, thus the flag was never brought down, nor had the ship been surrendered by the Peruvians. One of the Chilean officers observed that something similar happened to the Chilean ship &quot;Magallanes&quot;.

== Consequences ==
With this combat, the Chilean navy eliminated the menace of the Peruvian fleet. With &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s capture, plus the previous loss of &quot;Independencia&quot; at Punta Gruesa, the firepower of the Peruvian Navy was drastically reduced, and Chile incorporated the monitor in its fleet. The loss of both vessels, plus the death of Admiral Grau, Peruvians&#x27; best naval officer, gave the Chilean navy uncontested control of the Pacific coast of Peru bringing the naval campaign of the War of the Pacific to its end. The decisive victory at Angamos allowed the Chilean Army to freely pursue the plan to attack the Allies, and the land invasion of Peru began.

At the same time, it prevented the allies from carrying out concentrations and resupplying of their armies in southern Peru. Nor would Peru or Bolivia have the possibility of initiating a land attack on the Chilean forces in Antofagasta because it could not supply them by sea.

Technical learnings:
* Effectiveness of the design of armored ships having rotating turrets with large caliber guns as the main weapon.
* The 250 pound Palliser Ammunition had devastating effects against the &quot;Huáscar&quot;. It was the first combat use of such anti-armor projectiles. 
* Reports on the combat appeared in various European and American magazines.

The Battle of Angamos is commemorated with an annual public holiday in Peru.

<doc id="1169501" wikidata="Q7537579" url="?curid=1169501" title="Sky lobby">
<text>A sky lobby is an intermediate interchange floor in a skyscraper where people can change from an express elevator that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator that stops at a subset of higher floors. 

Early uses of the sky lobby include the original Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and 875 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago.

Nearly 200 people were estimated to have been in the 78th floor sky lobby of the South Tower of the original World Trade Center when it was hit directly by United Airlines Flight 175, leaving only around a dozen who survived the impact and escaped the tower before it collapsed.

== One World Trade Center (Manhattan) ==
One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in New York City. Like the original World Trade Center buildings it replaced, the new building has a sky lobby to reduce the amount of space devoted to elevators. The sky lobby is on the 64th floor; Each set of five to six stories is served by a separate bank of elevators. The elevators to the sky lobby, along with the ones used for the nonstop service to the 100th-floor One World Observatory, are the fastest in the Western Hemisphere. The observatory elevator transports passengers 100 floors in under one minute.

== 875 North Michigan Avenue (Chicago) ==
The John Hancock Center&#x27;s sky lobby on the 44th floor serves only the residential portion of the building that occupies 48 floors (floors 45–92). Three express elevators run from the residential lobby on the ground floor to the 44th floor, with all three of the elevators stopping at one of the parking garage levels. At floor 44, residents transfer to two banks of three elevators. One bank serves 21 floors (floors 45–65) and the other serves 28 floors (floors 65–92). Although all six elevators stop at floor 65, this floor is roughly the same layout as the residential floors immediately above and below it. It is not a sky lobby because residents can also board elevators to higher floors at floor 44.

The tower&#x27;s 44th floor sky lobby includes a pool, gym, dry cleaner, convenience store, about 700 mailboxes, two &quot;party&quot; rooms, a sitting area overlooking Lake Michigan, a small library, a refuse room (with trash chutes emptying here), offices for the managers of the residential condominium, and a polling station for residents during elections.

Floors above 92 are serviced by direct passenger elevators from the ground floor, and by two freight elevators that serve 55 floors (floors 44 to 98).

<doc id="1169505" wikidata="Q33947" url="?curid=1169505" title="Northern Sámi">
<text>Northern Sámi or North Sámi ( ; ; ; ; ; disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp) is the most widely spoken of all Sámi languages. The area where Northern Sámi is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sámi speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden, with the remaining portions being in Norway.

==History==

Among the first printed Sámi texts is (&quot;Swedish and Lappish ABC book&quot;), written in Swedish and what is likely a form of Northern Sámi. It was published in two editions in 1638 and 1640 and includes 30 pages of prayers and confessions of Protestant faith. It has been described as the first book &quot;with a regular Sámi language form&quot;.

Northern Sámi was first described by Knud Leem () in 1748 and in dictionaries in 1752 and 1768. One of Leem&#x27;s fellow grammaticians, who had also assisted him, was Anders Porsanger, himself Sámi and in fact the first Sámi to receive higher education, who studied at the Trondheim Cathedral School and other schools, but who was unable to publish his work on Sámi due to racist attitudes at the time. The majority of his work has disappeared.

In 1832, Rasmus Rask published the highly influential (&#x27;Reasoned Sámi Grammar&#x27;), Northern Sámi orthography being based on his notation (according to E. N. Setälä).

No major official nationwide surveys on the distribution of speakers by municipality or county in Norway have been done. A 2000 survey by the Sami Language Council showed Kautokeino Municipality and Karasjok Municipality as 96% and 94% Sami-speaking respectively; should those percentages still be true as of the 2022 national population survey, this would result in 2,761 and 2,428 speakers respectively, virtually all of which being speakers of Northern Sámi. Tromsø Municipality has no speaker statistics despite having (as of June 2019) the largest voter roll in the 2021 Norwegian Sámi parliamentary election. A common urban myth is that Oslo has the largest Sámi population despite being nowhere near the core Sápmi area, but it had only the 5th largest voter roll in 2019.

===Assimilation===

The mass mobilization during the Alta controversy as well as a more tolerant political environment caused a change to the Norwegian policy of assimilation during the last decades of the twentieth century.
In Norway, Northern Sámi is currently an official language in Troms and Finnmark counties along with eight municipalities (Guovdageaidnu, Kárášjohka, Unjárga, Deatnu, Porsáŋgu, Gáivuotna, Loabák and Dielddanuorri). Sámi born before 1977 have never learned to write Sámi according to the currently used orthography in school, so it is only in recent years that there have been Sámi capable of writing their own language for various administrative positions.

In the 1980s, a Northern Sámi Braille alphabet was developed, based on the Scandinavian Braille alphabet but with seven additional letters (á, č, đ, ŋ, š, ŧ, ž) required for writing in Northern Sámi.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory of Northern Sámi is large, contrasting voicing for many consonants. Some analyses of Northern Sámi phonology may include preaspirated stops and affricates (, , , , ) and pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals (voiceless , , , and voiced , , , ). However, these can be treated as clusters for the purpose of phonology, since they are clearly composed of two segments and only the first of these lengthens in quantity 3. The terms &quot;preaspirated&quot; and &quot;pre-stopped&quot; will be used in this article to describe these combinations for convenience.

Notes:
* Voiceless stops have voiced or partly voiced allophones when they occur adjacent to voiced sounds, and sometimes also word-initially.
* Stops before a homorganic nasal are realised as unreleased stops. Some, particularly younger, speakers instead realise voiceless stops as a glottal stop in this position, and decompose voiced stops into a homorganic nasal + glottal stop combination (, etc.).
* is realised as a labiodental fricative in the syllable onset (before a vowel), and as bilabial or in the syllable coda (in a consonant cluster). Although is a fricative, it behaves phonologically like an approximant, in particular like .
* Quantity 3 geminated plain stops and affricates (written , , , , , ) are variously described as voiced (, , , , , ) or partly voiced (, , , , , ).
* Voiceless sonorants are very rare, but occur more frequently as allophonic realisations. A combination of sonorant followed by in the coda (, , , , , , ), is realised as the equivalent voiceless sonorant (with becoming ). Voiceless only occurs this way, and is quite rare.
* A combination of followed by a stop or affricate in the onset (, etc.) is realised as preaspiration (, ).
* is extremely rare.
* is realized as when it is between two unstressed syllables.
* The pronunciation of the cluster varies between , , and depending on dialect.
* can be pronounced .

====Dialectal variation====
Not all Northern Sámi dialects have identical consonant inventories. Some consonants are absent from some dialects, while others are distributed differently.

* Western Finnmark lacks , using in its place. This also applies to sequences of pre-stopped and , which become and respectively. is retained before a velar consonant, but as an allophone of .
* Eastern Finnmark does not have voiced pre-stopped nasals, replacing them with voiceless equivalents.
* Sea Sámi does not have pre-stopped nasals at all, having geminate nasals in their place.
* The postaspirated stops do not occur in Western Finnmark dialects, plain stops are used instead. They occur only in recent loanwords from the Scandinavian languages, and only before a stressed syllable when not next to another consonant.

====Consonant length and gradation====

Consonants, including clusters, that occur after a stressed syllable can occur in multiple distinctive length types, or quantities. These are conventionally labelled quantity 1, 2 and 3 or Q1, Q2 and Q3 for short. The consonants of a word alternate in a process known as consonant gradation, where consonants appear in different quantities depending on the specific grammatical form. Normally, one of the possibilities is named the &quot;strong grade&quot;, while the other is named &quot;weak grade&quot;. The consonants of a weak grade are normally quantity 1 or 2, while the consonants of a strong grade are normally quantity 2 or 3.

* Quantity 1 includes any single consonant. It originates from Proto-Samic single consonants in the weak grade.
* Quantity 2 includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a short consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable (in Eastern Finnmark, any combination of consonants preceded by a long vowel or diphthong). It originates from Proto-Samic single consonants in the strong grade, as well as combinations of two consonants in the weak grade.
* Quantity 3 includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a long consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable (in Eastern Finnmark, any combination of consonants preceded by a short vowel or diphthong). It originates from Proto-Samic combinations of two consonants in the strong grade.

Throughout this article and related articles, consonants that are part of different syllables are written with two consonant letters in IPA, while the lengthening of consonants in quantity 3 is indicated with an IPA length mark ().

Not all consonants can occur in every quantity type. The following limitations exist:
* Single is restricted to quantity 1, and does not alternate.
* Postaspirated consonants do not occur after a stressed syllable, and thus do not have any quantity distinctions.
* Voiced stops and affricates only occur in quantity 3. In quantity 1, voiced stops are allophones of the corresponding voiceless stops.
* , and occur in quantity 2 and 3, but not in quantity 1.

When a consonant can occur in all three quantities, quantity 3 is termed &quot;overlong&quot;.

In quantity 3, if the syllable coda consists of only , or , the additional length of this consonant is realised phonetically as an epenthetic vowel. This vowel assimilates to the quality of the surrounding vowels:
* Between two rounded vowels (but not the diphthong ) in the adjacent syllables, it becomes .
* Before a front vowel in the next syllable, it becomes , e.g. , phonetically .
* Otherwise, it becomes , e.g. , phonetically .
This does not occur if the second consonant is a dental/alveolar stop, e.g. , phonetically , or , phonetically .

===Vowels===
Northern Sámi possesses the following vowels:

Closing diphthongs such as also exist, but these are phonologically composed of a vowel plus one of the semivowels or . The semivowels still behave as consonants in clusters.

Not all of these vowel phonemes are equally prevalent; some occur generally while others occur only in specific contexts as the result of sound changes. The following rules apply for stressed syllables:
* Short , , and , the normal diphthongs, and the long vowel occur generally.
* The other long vowels occur only in the context of diphthong simplification (below).
* Short is rare, and mostly occurs due to the combination of diphthong simplification plus stressed vowel shortening.
* Rising diphthongs and half-long occur only due to unstressed vowel shortening in the next syllable.

The distribution in post-stressed syllables (unstressed syllables following a stressed one) is more restricted:
* Short and long , and occur generally.
* Short and occur more rarely, sometimes from Proto-Samic &quot;*i&quot; and &quot;*u&quot; and sometimes as a result of unstressed vowel shortening.
* Short and occur only before .
* No diphthongs occur at all, nor do half-long or long and .

In a second unstressed syllable (one that follows another unstressed syllable), no long vowels occur and , and are the only vowels that occur frequently.

The standard orthography of Northern Sámi distinguishes vowel length in the case of versus , although this is primarily on an etymological basis. Not all instances of are phonemically long, due to both stressed and unstressed vowel shortening. Some dialects also have lengthening of under certain circumstances. Nonetheless, a default length can be assumed for these two letters. For the remaining vowels, vowel length is not indicated in the standard orthography. In reference works, macrons can be placed above long vowels that occur in a position where they can be short. Length of and in a post-stressed syllable is assumed, and not indicated, except in the combinations and , where these letters can also indicate short vowels.

====Dialectal variation====
The Eastern Finnmark dialects possess additional contrasts that other dialects of Northern Sámi do not:
* There is a maximally three-way contrast among open vowels between , and , both short and long.
** The vowel spelled is in stressed syllables, in unstressed syllables.
** The vowel spelled is in stressed syllables if the next syllable has a back vowel (including but not ), and everywhere else (including all unstressed syllables).
* In other eastern varieties, only a two-way contrast between and is found. Jarvansalo (2006) reports the Kárášjohka dialect following this contrast, but having for , for stressed .
* There is a length contrast between short and long diphthongs. In other dialects, this distinction exists as well, but is allophonic.

Some Torne dialects have and instead of stressed and (from diphthong simplification) as well as unstressed and .

===Phonological processes===

====Diphthong simplification====

Diphthongs can undergo simplification when the following syllable contains short &quot;e&quot;, short &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ii&quot; , or ui . This means that only the first vowel of the diphthong remains, which also undergoes lengthening before grade 1 and 2 consonant clusters and geminates. Note that some instances of &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;ui&quot; (specifically /uːj/) do not cause simplification. Below are some examples:
* &quot;ie&quot; → &quot;ī&quot;: &quot;to run&quot; → &quot;I ran&quot;
* &quot;ea&quot; → &quot;ē&quot;: &quot;summer&quot; → &quot;of the summers&quot;
* &quot;oa&quot; → &quot;ō&quot;: &quot;to sew&quot; → &quot;they sew&quot;
* &quot;uo&quot; → &quot;ū&quot;: &quot;tree&quot; → &quot;into the tree&quot;

====Unstressed vowel shortening====

Shortening of long vowels in unstressed syllables occurs irregularly. It commonly occurs in the first element of a compound word, in a fourth syllable, and in various other unpredictable circumstances. When shortened, and are lowered to and , except before . Shortened vowels are denoted here, and in other reference works, with an underdot: &quot;ạ&quot;, &quot;ẹ&quot;, &quot;ọ&quot;, to distinguish them from originally-short vowels.

When a long vowel or diphthong occurs in the stressed syllable before the shortened vowel, it becomes half-long/rising.
* &quot;oldest&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;fearless&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. pl.)

When the consonant preceding the shortened vowel is quantity 3, any lengthened elements are shortened so that it becomes quantity 2. However, the resulting consonant is not necessarily the weak-grade equivalent of that consonant. If the consonant was previously affected by consonant lengthening (below), this process shortens it again.

* &quot;mother&quot; → &quot;mother pig&quot;; contrast the weak grade in 
* &quot;year&quot; → &quot;half-year&quot;

====Stressed vowel shortening====

In the Eastern Finnmark dialects, long vowels as well as diphthongs are shortened before a quantity 3 consonant. This is phonemic due to the loss of length in quantity 3 in these dialects.
* &quot;mother&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (gen. pl.)
* &quot;waterfall&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (ill. sg.)
* &quot;teaching&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;guest&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;grandmother&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)

Outside Eastern Finnmark, long is only shortened before a long preaspirate, not before any other consonants. The shortening of diphthongs remains allophonic due to the preservation of quantity 3 length, but the shortening of long vowels that result from diphthong simplification is phonemic.

====Stressed vowel lengthening====
In the Eastern Finnmark dialects, short vowels are lengthened when they occur before a quantity 1 or 2 consonant. Combined with the preceding change, vowel length in stressed syllables becomes conditioned entirely by the following consonant quantity. Moreover, because the coda lengthening in quantity 3 is lost in these dialects, vowel length becomes the only means for distinguishing quantities 3 and 2 in many cases.

* &quot;lock&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;nail&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;cat&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)

====Lengthening of unstressed short /a/====

In the Western Finnmark dialects, a short in a post-stressed syllable is lengthened to if the preceding consonants are quantity 1 or 2, and the preceding syllable contains a short vowel. Compare the Eastern Finnmark pronunciations of these words under &quot;stressed vowel lengthening&quot;.

* &quot;lock&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.).
* &quot;nail&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;cloud&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)

A long that originates from this process does &quot;not&quot; trigger consonant lengthening.

====Consonant lengthening====

In dialects outside Eastern Finnmark, in quantity 2, the last coda consonant is lengthened if the following vowel is long, and the preceding vowel is a short monophthong. Since the coda now contains a long consonant, it is considered as quantity 3, but the lengthening is mostly allophonic and is not indicated orthographically. It is phonemic in the Western Finnmark dialects when the following vowel is , because lengthening is triggered by an original long but not by an original short that was lengthened (as described above).

The new consonant may coincide with its Q3 consonant gradation counterpart, effectively making a weak grade strong, or it may still differ in other ways. In particular, no change is made to syllable division, so that in case of Q2 consonants with a doubled final consonant, it is actually the first of this pair that lengthens, making it overlong.

* &quot;year&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;fear&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;sum&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.); contrast &quot;polar night&quot; ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;eye&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.); contrast &quot;palm tree&quot; ~ (acc. sg.)
* &quot;bird&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ (acc. sg.); contrast &quot;period&quot; ~ (acc. sg.)

Lengthening also occurs if the preceding vowel is a close diphthong or . In this case, the diphthong also shortens before the new quantity 3 consonant.
* , phonetically &quot;protection&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ , phonetically (acc. sg.); contrast &quot;track, trail&quot; , phonetically ~ (acc. sg.) with no lengthening.
* , phonetically &quot;field&quot; (nom. sg.) ~ , phonetically (acc. sg.)

===Prosody===

Stress is generally not phonemic in Northern Sámi; the first syllable of a word always carries primary stress. Like most Sámi languages, Northern Sámi follows a pattern of alternating (trochaic) stress, in which each odd-numbered syllable after the first is secondarily stressed and even-numbered syllables are unstressed. The last syllable of a word is never stressed, unless the word has only one syllable.

Consequently, words can follow three possible patterns:
* A single stressed syllable.
* An even number of syllables: Ending in a stressed odd-numbered syllable followed by an unstressed even-numbered syllable.
* An odd number of syllables: Ending in a stressed odd-numbered syllable followed by an unstressed even-numbered syllable, and an unstressed odd-numbered (final) syllable.
This gives the following pattern, which can be extended indefinitely in theory. S indicates stress, _ indicates no stress:
* S
* S _
* S _ _
* S _ S _
* S _ S _ _
* S _ S _ S _
* etc.

The number of syllables, and the resulting stress pattern, is important for grammatical reasons. Words with stems having an even number of syllables from the last inflect differently from words with stems having an odd number of syllables. This is detailed further in the grammar section.

In compound words, which consist of several distinct word roots, each word retains its own stress pattern, potentially breaking from the normal trochaic pattern. If the first element of a compound has an odd number of syllables, then there will be a sequence of two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed one, which does not occur in non-compound words. In some cases, the first element of a compound has only one syllable, resulting in two adjacent stressed syllables. Hence, stress is lexically significant in that it can distinguish compounds from non-compounds.

Recent loanwords generally keep the stress of the language they were borrowed from, assigning secondary stress to the syllable that was stressed in the original word. The normal trochaic pattern can also be broken in this case, but words will still be made to fit into the even or odd inflection patterns. Words with penultimate stress ending in a consonant will follow the odd inflection:
* &quot;neon&quot;
* &quot;apostle&quot;

Words with antepenultimate or earlier stress will have the stress modified, as this is not allowed in Northern Sámi:
* &quot;pineapple&quot;
* &quot;Africa&quot;
* &quot;America&quot;

Final stress is not allowed, so if the original word has final stress, an extra dummy syllable (generally &quot;a&quot;) is added in Northern Sámi to avoid this.
* &quot;car&quot;
* &quot;bomb&quot;
* &quot;culture&quot;
* &quot;adverb&quot;
* &quot;tomato&quot;
* &quot;lawyer&quot;
* &quot;capacity&quot;
* &quot;mathematics&quot;

As a result of retaining the original stress pattern, some loanwords have sequences of three unstressed syllables, which do not occur in any other environment:
* &quot;to specialise&quot;
* &quot;to theorise&quot;
* &quot;administration&quot;

Conjunctions, postpositions, particles, and monosyllabic pronouns tend to be unstressed altogether, and therefore fall outside the above rules.

==Dialects==
Sammallahti divides Northern Sámi dialects into certain regions as follows:
* Finnmark dialects
** Western Finnmark: eastern Enontekiö, northern Sodankylä, and part of Inari in Finland plus Kautokeino and Alta in Norway
** Eastern Finnmark: Utsjoki and part of Inari in Finland plus Karasjok, Porsanger, and Tana in Norway
* Torne dialects
** Finnish Wedge: western Enontekiö in Finland plus Skibotnelva, Gálggojávri, and Nordreisa in Norway
** Karesuando: Könkämävuoma and Lainiovuoma in Sweden plus Lyngen and Balsfjord in Norway
** Jukkasjärvi: Saarivuoma, Talma, Rautasvuoma and Kaalasvuoma in Sweden plus Vågsfjord and Ofotfjord in Norway
** Kaitum: Norrkaitum and Mellanbyn in Sweden
* Sea Sámi

The written language is primarily based on the western Finnmark dialects, with some elements from the eastern Finnmark dialects.

===Western Finnmark dialects===
Features of the western Finnmark dialects are:
* Merging of the velar nasals into the palatal nasals, except before a (plain or preaspirated) homorganic stop.
* Lengthening of short when the preceding syllable contains a short vowel and a quantity 1 or 2 consonant. This new long does not trigger consonant lengthening.
* Kautokeino: Merging of into .
* Kautokeino: Assibilation of into .

===Eastern Finnmark dialects===
The eastern Finnmark dialects have the following characteristics:

* Lengthening of stressed vowels before quantity 1 and 2 consonants.
* Shortening of the first element of quantity 3 consonants, merging them with quantity 2 consonants (unless the second element of the corresponding Q2 consonant is doubled, which keeps them distinct). Combined with the previous change, this causes Q3-Q2 gradation in Eastern Finnmark to become primarily about vowel length rather than consonant length.
* A distinction between and , the former spelled and reflecting Proto-Samic &quot;*ā&quot;, the latter spelled and reflecting Proto-Samic &quot;*ë&quot;.
* Fronting of to in unstressed syllables.
* Umlaut: fronting of vowels before a following front vowel in the second syllable (including produced by the previous change).
** is fronted to .
** is fronted to .
** is fronted to .
** is fronted to .
* Between vowels, lenition of to , and of to , which in modern speech becomes between a stressed vowel and a front vowel, and zero otherwise.
* Raising of the non-close diphthongs and .
** Along the lower Tana river, these merge entirely with standard and , resulting in and (when not fronted) or and (when fronted).
** Along the upper Tana, the non-close diphthongs are only raised before single and (original) geminate consonants, and they may or may not merge with original and . 
** In dialects south of Tana bru, only fronted and are raised to and .

===Torne dialects===
* Jukkasjärvi, Karesuando, Finnish Wedge: Loss of distinction between postalveolar and plain alveolar consonants, with the result being alveolar in Karesuando and postalveolar in the Finnish Wedge.
* Use of &quot;-n&quot; instead of &quot;-s&quot; in the locative singular. This originates from the old inessive case, whereas the standard ending is from the old elative case.
* Use of &quot;-o&quot; instead of &quot;-u&quot; in the third-person singular present tense.
* Jukkasjärvi and Kaitum: Use of &quot;-is&quot; instead of &quot;-in&quot; in the locative plural. Again, these originate from two different older cases.
* Karesuando: Long and from diphthong simplification are re-diphthongised to and .
* Jukkasjärvi and Karesuando: Raising of short to before and .
* Jukkasjärvi and Karesuando: and instead of standard long and in post-stressed syllables.
* All except Finnish Wedge: and instead of standard and from the Proto-Samic clusters &quot;*mt&quot; and &quot;*mč&quot;.

===Sea Sámi dialects===
* Lack of fortition in strong-grade nasals and glides, thus , , , rather than , , and .
* Use of &quot;-st&quot; instead of &quot;-s&quot; in the locative singular.
* Eastern Sea Sámi: Loss of distinction between postalveolar and plain alveolar consonants.

==Orthography==

Northern Sámi has a long orthographic history, which includes no fewer than 9 Latin alphabets.

===History===
The roots of the current orthography for Northern Sámi were laid by Rasmus Rask who, after discussions with Nils Vibe Stockfleth, published in 1832. Rask opted for a phonemic orthographic system. All of the orthographies that have been used for Northern Sámi trace their roots back to Rask&#x27;s system, unlike the orthographies used for Lule and Southern Sámi, which are mainly based on the orthographical conventions of Swedish and Norwegian. Following in the tradition of Rask meant that diacritics were used with some consonants (, , , , and ), which caused data-processing problems before Unicode was introduced. Both Stockfleth and J. A. Friis went on to publish grammar books and dictionaries for Sámi. It can be said that Northern Sámi was better described than Norwegian was before Ivar Aasen published his &quot;Grammar of the Norwegian Dialects&quot;.

Northern Sámi was and is used in three countries, each of which used its own orthography for years. Friis&#x27; orthography was used when work on translating the Bible into Northern Sámi commenced, in the first Sámi newspaper called &quot;Saǥai Muittalægje&quot;, and in the Finnemisjonen&#x27;s own newspaper &quot;Nuorttanaste&quot;. The groundwork for Northern Sámi lexicography was laid by Konrad Nielsen who used an orthography of his own creation in his dictionary . Starting in 1948, the orthographies used in Norway and Sweden were combined into a single &quot;Bergsland-Ruong orthography&quot;. It was not greatly used in Norway. In 1979, an official orthography for Northern Sámi was adopted for use in Norway, Sweden and Finland.

Thus, until the official orthography currently in use was adopted in 1979, each country had its own, slightly different standard, so it is quite possible to come across older books that are difficult to understand for people unacquainted with the orthography:
# 

(The children have come to school.)

The first sentence is from Antti Outakoski&#x27;s from 1950; the second one is how it would be written according to the current orthography.

===Alphabet===
The most recent alphabet was approved in 1979 and last modified in 1985:

When typing, if there is no way of entering the letters particular to Northern Sámi () correctly, an acute accent is sometimes placed over the corresponding Latin letter as a substitute. These substitutions are still found in books printed after the common orthography was adopted due to system limitations when typing.

===Marks used in reference works===
Some additional marks are used in dictionaries, grammars and other reference works, including in this article. They are not used in normal writing. The following are used in Pekka Sammallahti&#x27;s :
* A vertical mark ˈ or apostrophe or other similar mark is placed between two identical consonants to indicate an overlong (quantity 3) consonant, e.g. &quot;golˈli&quot; &quot;gold&quot;.
* The same mark may be used in the combination to indicate the Q3 consonant cluster .
* A macron is placed above vowel letters to indicate a long vowel (, , , ).
* A dot is placed below vowel letters to indicate an unstressed vowel that has been shortened (, , ), which in turn hints that preceding vowels are rising/half-long, and preceding Q3 consonants are shortened.

===Multigraphs===
Northern Sámi orthography includes many combinations of multiple letters. In most cases, a double consonant letter corresponds to a doubled consonant phoneme, e.g. &quot;mm&quot; stands for . Overlong (quantity 3) consonants are not distinguished from regular double consonants, but are commonly denoted with a vertical mark between the two consonant letters (, , etc.) in reference works.

Combinations of different consonant letters stand for their equivalent individual phonemes, as described by the pronunciations of the individual letters, above. The last consonant in a sequence may be doubled. This indicates that the consonant cluster is quantity 2, while a cluster with an undoubled last consonant is generally quantity 3. It often also indicates a doubling of the corresponding consonant phoneme, but not if the preceding consonant is voiceless.

The following details combinations of multiple letters which are exceptions to the general pronunciation rules of each letter.

====Diphthongs====
The diphthongs, as may be expected, are written using a combination of two letters. Length is not indicated, nor is the distinction between normal and rising diphthongs. This distinction can be inferred by the presence of and in the next syllable (which must always be shortened vowels when following a diphthong), and in reference works by the presence of vowels with an underdot in the next syllable.

====Ending in ====
The combinations , and indicate , and respectively. The first letter is doubled to indicate longer versions, and a vertical line is then used for overlong .

In the case of , there are two possible interpretations: as a single quantity 2 consonant , or as a quantity 3 consonant cluster (e.g. ), although the latter is rare. These two cases are distinguished by their behaviour in consonant gradation. In the first case, appears in the strong grade while appears in the weak grade, and these represent overlong and long respectively. In the second case, , alternatively written , appears in the strong grade while appears in the weak grade, representing the clusters and respectively.

====Beginning with ====

Preaspiration is indicated with a preceding . Long preaspiration is indicated by doubling the second letter. This is exactly the opposite of how normal clusters are written.

Voiceless sonorants are also indicated by a preceding , but they have three lengths. Overlong length is indicated by a vertical line in reference works, as with other sonorants.

====Stop-nasal combinations====

Pre-stopped nasal consonants (Q2) are indicated by a preceding letter for a voiceless stop. Voiced pre-stopped nasals (Q3) are written with a voiced stop in place of the voiceless one.

===Hyphenation===

With just a single consonant between syllables, the hyphen goes before that consonant.
* i-ja
* de-há-laš

If a word contains a double consonant letter, the hyphen is always placed between those two letters. The combination , when preceded by a vowel, counts as a double consonant and thus gets a hyphen in between.
* guol-li
* áhk-ká
* beaiv-váš
* krist-ta-laš
* bi-o-lo-gii-ja

With other combinations of two consonants, the hyphen goes between those. Again, if counts as a consonant, it goes between that and the next one.
* Sáp-mi
* bái-di
* kon-sear-ta
* duos-tan

There are a few exceptions where the hyphen goes before all consonants.
* pro-gram-ma
* in-du-strii-ja

In compound words, a hyphen always goes between two parts of a compound.
* má-ilm-mi
* gas-ka-i-ja-beaiv-váš

==Grammar==
Northern Sámi is a highly inflected language that shares many grammatical features with the other Uralic languages. Sámi has also developed considerably into the direction from originally an agglutinative morphology, to that of fusional and inflected one, much like Estonian to which it is distantly related. Therefore, morphemes are marked not only by suffixes but also by morphophonological modifications to the root. Of the various morphophonological alterations, the most important and complex is the system of consonant gradation.

===Consonant gradation===
Consonant gradation is a pattern of alternations between pairs of consonants that appears in the inflection of words. The system of consonant gradation in Northern Sámi is complex, especially compared to that found in the Finnic languages. A word stem can appear in two &quot;grades&quot;: the strong grade and the weak grade. A given word can alternate either between quantity 3 in the strong grade and quantity 2 in the weak grade, or between quantity 2 in the strong grade and quantity 1 in the weak grade. Historically, the weak grade appeared when the syllable following the consonant was closed (ended in a consonant), but the loss of certain vowels or consonants have obscured this in Northern Sámi and it is now a more-or-less opaque process.

In verbs, some nouns, and in some processes of word derivation, a Q2 strong grade can become &quot;extra strong&quot; Q3, alternating in all three quantities. This is caused by the historical loss of a consonant (often or ) between the second and third syllable, which triggered compensatory lengthening on the gradating consonant.

====Quantity 3 ~ 2 alternations====
Alternations between quantities 3 and 2 are either consonant clusters or sequences of two identical consonants. In the strong grade, the first consonant forms the coda of the preceding syllable, and the remaining consonants form the onset of the following syllable. In the weak grade, only the last consonant belongs to the onset of the next syllable, and the remaining consonants belong to the coda of the preceding syllable. Thus, when there are three or more consonants, the syllable division changes between the grades. In addition, the strong grade by default has a lengthened consonant in the coda, while this lengthening is generally absent in the weak grade. However, this lengthening is subject to the modifying effects of consonant lengthening and unstressed vowel shortening, which can in some occasions level the length distinctions, so that length not an absolute indicator of grade (though it is of &quot;quantity&quot;). In Eastern Finnmark, no lengthening is found at all, instead of length the preceding vowel is short, while the vowel becomes long when the length would be absent.

Doubling of the last consonant is another distinguishing feature of the weak grade, although it only occurs if the preceding consonant is voiced. The additional consonant is always assigned to the coda (the double consonant is split between syllables), so that it obligatorily shifts the syllable boundary relative to the strong grade:
* &quot;vl&quot; ~ &quot;vll&quot; 
* &quot;id&quot; ~ &quot;idd&quot; 
Consonant lengthening can then, in turn, lengthen the first of this pair again (the one in the coda). In writing, the last consonant is doubled in the weak grade, even if the preceding consonant is voiceless, simply to distinguish the two grades visually:
* &quot;st&quot; ~ &quot;stt&quot; 
* &quot;vst&quot; ~ &quot;vstt&quot; 

Sequences of two identical consonants gradate in the same way, with lengthening of the first consonant in the strong grade (again, subject to modification, and not in Eastern Finnmark), but without any doubling of the last consonant in the weak grade. For most pairs of consonants, no difference is made between the grades orthographically, both are written with a double consonant. In reference works, the special mark ˈ is placed between the consonants to indicate the strong grade.

Some cases are indicated specially in the orthography, but behave as expected from a phonological point of view:
* Clusters beginning with (preaspirated stops): the second consonant is written doubled in the &quot;strong&quot; grade instead of the weak grade. In Eastern Finnmark the length is lost, making both grades identical (but still with different preceding vowel lengths).
** &quot;hpp&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;hp&quot; 
** &quot;htt&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;ht&quot; 
** &quot;hcc&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;hc&quot; 
** &quot;hčč&quot; (EF /h.t͡ʃ/) ~ &quot;hč&quot; 
** &quot;hkk&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;hk&quot; 
* Clusters of plus pre-stopped nasal: orthographically indicated the same as lone pre-stopped nasals (below), but both grades have a voiceless stop, and differ only in the length of the first consonant and syllabification. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is missing from the strong grade.
** &quot;rbm&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;rpm&quot; 
** &quot;rdn&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;rtn&quot; 
** &quot;rdnj&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;rtnj&quot; 
** &quot;rgŋ&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;rkŋ&quot; 
* Sequences of two : the strong grade is indicated by a doubled first consonant, the weak grade by only a single one. This is possible because this consonant cannot occur singly (as quantity 1).
** &quot;llj&quot; ~ &quot;lj&quot; 
* Sequences of two : both grades are indicated identically. The strong grade can be distinguished with an overlength mark in reference works.
** &quot;nˈnj&quot; ~ &quot;nnj&quot; 
* Sequences of two voiceless sonorants: both grades are indicated identically. The strong grade can be distinguished with an overlength mark in reference works.
** &quot;hjˈj&quot; ~ &quot;hjj&quot; 
** &quot;hlˈl&quot; ~ &quot;hll&quot; 
** &quot;hmˈm&quot; ~ &quot;hmm&quot; 
** &quot;hnˈn&quot; ~ &quot;hnn&quot; 
** &quot;hrˈr&quot; ~ &quot;hrr&quot; 

In some clusters, there is an alternation in the quality of the first consonant between the two grades.
* Clusters beginning with in the strong grade: becomes in the weak grade. is inserted before a stop or affricate, and in other cases the last consonant phoneme can be doubled in the weak grade.
** &quot;kc&quot; ~ &quot;vcc&quot; ()
** &quot;ks&quot; ~ &quot;vss&quot; 
** &quot;kst&quot; ~ &quot;vstt&quot; 
** &quot;kt&quot; ~ &quot;vtt&quot; ()
* Clusters of pre-stopped nasals: a voiced stop occurs in the strong grade, and a voiceless stop in the weak grade. The voiceless stop, in turn, blocks doubling of the last consonant. In this case, however, there is no doubling in the orthography. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is devoiced in the strong grade, making the two grades identical (but still with different preceding vowel lengths). In Sea Sámi, this alternation is replaced by geminate nasals.
** &quot;bm&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;pm&quot; 
** &quot;dn&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;tn&quot; 
** &quot;dnj&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;tnj&quot; 
** &quot;gŋ&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;kŋ&quot; 
* Clusters of a voiced consonant (except ) plus pre-stopped nasal: the stop is voiceless and occurs only in the strong grade, the weak grade has doubling of the nasal. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is missing from the strong grade.
** &quot;lbm&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;lmm&quot; 
** &quot;idn&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;inn&quot; 
** &quot;vdnj&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;vnnj&quot; 
** &quot;lgŋ&quot; (EF ) ~ &quot;lŋŋ&quot; 
* Sequences of two homorganic plain stops: the first stop is voiced in the strong grade, voiceless in the weak grade. The strong grade is represented orthographically by a pair of voiced consonants.
** &quot;bb&quot; ~ &quot;pp&quot; 
** &quot;dd&quot; ~ &quot;tt&quot; 
** &quot;gg&quot; ~ &quot;kk&quot; 
** &quot;zz&quot; ~ &quot;cc&quot; 
** &quot;žž&quot; ~ &quot;čč&quot; 
* Sequences of two palatal stops: these are phonetically the same as the previous, but different orthographically.
** &quot;ddj&quot; ~ &quot;dj&quot; 

====Quantity 2 ~ 1 alternations====
Alternations between 2 and 1 are less predictable than alternations between quantities 3 and 2. The weak grade is always represented by a single consonant, which forms the onset of the next syllable, and the preceding syllable has no coda. The corresponding strong grade additionally has a single consonant in the coda, which may the same as the following onset consonant or different. The coda consonant in the strong grade may undergo consonant lengthening to receive additional length.

A double consonant in the strong grade always alternates with a single consonant in the weak grade. This occurs with all nasals, sonorants and fricatives (except and ). Orthographically, this is represented as a double versus a single consonant letter.
* &quot;hrr&quot; ~ &quot;hr&quot; 
* &quot;mm&quot; ~ &quot;m&quot; 
* &quot;nnj&quot; ~ &quot;nj&quot; 
* &quot;ss&quot; ~ &quot;s&quot; 
* &quot;đđ&quot; ~ &quot;đ&quot; 

A cluster of short and a voiceless consonant (preaspirated) in the strong grade alternates with a single voiced consonant in the weak grade.
* &quot;hp&quot; ~ &quot;b&quot; ( in Eastern Finnmark)
* &quot;ht&quot; ~ &quot;đ&quot; 
* &quot;hc&quot; ~ &quot;z&quot; 
* &quot;hč&quot; ~ &quot;ž&quot; 
* &quot;hk&quot; ~ &quot;g&quot; ( or zero in Eastern Finnmark)

A cluster of a voiceless pre-stopped nasal in the strong grade drops the stop in the weak grade. In Sea Sámi, the strong grade has a double nasal, without the stop.
* &quot;pm&quot; ~ &quot;m&quot; 
* &quot;tn&quot; ~ &quot;n&quot; 
* &quot;tnj&quot; ~ &quot;nj&quot; 
* &quot;kŋ&quot; ~ &quot;ŋ&quot; 

Double alternates with .
* &quot;dj&quot; ~ &quot;j&quot; 

===Changes to word-final consonants===

Only a limited number of consonants are allowed at the end of a word, those being &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; (pronounced ). The consonant clusters &quot;it&quot; and &quot;in&quot; are also allowed. Therefore, consonants will be modified or deleted when they come to stand word-finally:

* Consonant clusters are simplified to the first consonant, e.g. &quot;ld&quot; and &quot;rd&quot; become &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, respectively.
* The consonants &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; (pronounced ), &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, and &quot;hk&quot; all become &quot;t&quot;.
* The affricates &quot;z&quot;, &quot;ž&quot; and &quot;žž&quot; become fricative &quot;s&quot; and &quot;š&quot;.
* &quot;m&quot; becomes &quot;n&quot;. Some recent loanwords such as retain /m/.
* The consonants &quot;g&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; can also disappear entirely in certain words.

===Post-stressed vowel alternations===

Certain inflectional endings and derivational suffixes trigger changes in the first unstressed (post-stressed) vowel of the stem. These changes are generally the result of umlaut effects in Proto-Samic. The following changes may be noted. An empty table cell means there is no change, &quot;S&quot; indicates diphthong simplification.

There are some vowel alternations that do not have a clear rule or cause. For example, the change of &quot;a&quot; to &quot;á&quot; in the present tense third-person singular of verbs is unexpected and must simply be taken as-is. Likewise, the appearance of &quot;u&quot; or &quot;o&quot; in some verb imperative forms is not based on any rule, but is an inherent part of the ending.

===Inflection types===

All inflected words, whether nouns, adjectives or verbs, can be divided into three main inflectional classes. The division is based on whether there is an even or odd number of syllables from the last stressed syllable to the end of the word.
* Words with even inflection (, also called &quot;vowel stems&quot;) have an even number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem; usually two, but sometimes also four.
* Words with odd inflection (, also called &quot;consonant stems&quot;) have an odd number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem; usually three, but very rarely one or five.
* Words with contracted inflection () have an even number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem, but have the consonant gradation pattern of odd-inflection words. If the gradation has three levels, the strong grade is always level 3.

For nouns and adjectives, the stem is taken from the accusative/genitive singular rather than the nominative, as the latter often drops the final vowel and sometimes also the preceding consonant. For verbs, the infinitive is used to determine the stem, by removing the infinitive ending &quot;-t&quot;.

Words with even and contracted inflection can be divided further, based on the final vowel of the stem. For even-inflected words, this vowel is most commonly &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, while for contracted words it is mostly &quot;á&quot;, &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;. Words with odd inflection are not differentiated by stem-final vowel.

===Nouns===

Nouns inflect in singular () and plural (), and also in 7 cases. The following table shows the general endings; the actual forms can differ based on consonant gradation and the inflection type of the word.

The accusative and genitive are usually identical. There is no singular-plural distinction in the essive, so for example is interpreted as either &quot;as a child&quot; or &quot;as children&quot;.

====Even nouns====

Nouns with even inflection have an inherent stem-final vowel. They also usually have consonant gradation of the last consonant in the stem, where the strong grade appears in the nominative singular, illative singular and essive, while the weak grade appears in the remaining forms.

Some even nouns do not gradate. These can generally be divided into two groups:
* Originally non-gradating odd nouns that have undergone contraction. These appear with quantity 3 in all forms. The most notable of these are the agent nouns, which were formed in Proto-Samic with the suffix &quot;*-jē&quot;, but do not have any visible suffix in Northern Sámi anymore.
* Recent loanwords. These may appear with any consonant or cluster permissible in Northern Sámi.

The most common even nouns are the nouns with a stem ending in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-i&quot; or slightly rarer &quot;-u&quot;.

Even-syllable nouns with a stem ending in &quot;-á&quot;, &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot; also exist, but are much rarer.

Even nouns with four or more syllables sometimes drop the final vowel in the nominative singular. Consequently, simplification of the final consonant occurs. The stem of these nouns always ends in &quot;-a&quot;.

====Odd nouns====
Nouns with odd inflection are not distinguished by the stem-final vowel, all use the same set of endings. They can be divided into two types, gradating and non-gradating nouns:
* Non-gradating odd nouns originate from Proto-Samic nouns ending in a vowel. They have the same stem in all forms, with no gradation, although the last consonant(s) may be modified word-finally in the nominative singular. 
* Gradating odd nouns originate from Proto-Samic nouns ending in a consonant. They have consonant gradation, where the weak grade appears in the nominative and essive singular, and the strong grade appears in the remaining forms. The vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; change to &quot;á&quot; and &quot;o&quot; respectively in the last syllable of the strong-grade stem, caused by a former Proto-Samic &quot;*ë&quot; in the endings. The stem-final consonants &quot;-g&quot;, &quot;-m&quot; and &quot;-n&quot; disappear in the weak-grade forms, so that the essive ending is attached directly to the preceding vowel.

The following table shows three gradating odd nouns.

====Contracted nouns====
Nouns with contracted inflection are in origin gradating odd nouns, mostly with a stem ending in &quot;-j&quot; or &quot;-s&quot;, sometimes also &quot;-ž&quot; (in ).

In the strong-grade forms, the last-syllable vowel is modified as in gradating odd nouns. However, the stem-final consonant has been lost, causing contraction of the two neighbouring syllables. The preceding consonant cluster receives compensatory lengthening, making them quantity 3 regardless of original length. Consequently, the strong grade forms of such nouns have an even number of syllables and receive the same endings as even nouns, but do not gradate.

In the weak-grade forms, the original uncontracted form is usually preserved. The original final consonant &quot;-j&quot; has been lost after the vowels &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, so that it does not appear in any of the forms anymore.

====Possessive suffixes====

The possessive suffixes are similar in meaning to the English personal possessive determiners &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;their&quot; and so on. There are 9 possessive suffixes: one for each person in singular, dual and plural. Possessive suffixes attach to the end of a noun, after the case ending. Thus, for example, &quot;ruovttus&quot; &quot;in a house&quot; may become &quot;ruovttustan&quot; &quot;in my house&quot;.

Like noun case endings, the suffixes have different forms depending on whether they are attached to a stem with an even or odd number of syllables, and (in the case of even-syllable stems) depending on the last vowel of the stem. The following table shows the suffixes:

The suffixes attach to a combination of noun plus case ending, so the stem that the suffix is attached to may not be the stem of the noun. Rather, a new &quot;possessive stem&quot; is formed from the noun with its case ending included. This stem is not always identical to the ending of the noun on its own; some case endings undergo modifications or the addition of a final vowel. Thus, certain cases may have possessive stems that inherently end in &quot;-a&quot;, other cases may have &quot;-i&quot;, but this is only significant if the combination has an even number of syllables.

The following table shows the possessive stems for each case, for four of the nouns whose inflection was given above. If the stem ends in a vowel, it is even and the suffixes with the matching vowel are used. If the stem ends in a consonant, it is odd and the odd endings are used.

In the comitative plural, the possessive suffix attaches between the possessive stem and the final &quot;-guin&quot;.

As can be seen in the table, for the nominative, accusative and genitive singular cases, the possessive stem is identical to the noun stem. The stem also undergoes consonant gradation in the accusative and genitive singular forms, and endings beginning with &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot; also trigger diphthong simplification. The noun is in the strong grade with the first-person possessive suffixes, and in the weak grade with the second- and third-person possessives.

The possessive forms of &quot;ruoktu&quot; are:

===Adjectives===

Adjectives inflect the same as nouns do, and have the same cases and inflection types.

====Attributive form====

Adjectives also have an additional form, the attributive form (). This form is used when the adjective is used attributively, where it precedes the noun. The attributive does not receive any endings, so it does not have cases or number. Its formation is also unpredictable: for some adjectives, it is formed from the nominative singular by adding an extra ending of some kind to the stem, while for others the attributive is formed by &quot;removing&quot; part of the stem. It may also be identical to the nominative singular. Some examples:

A couple of adjectives do not have an attributive form. These are the frequently-used adjective &quot;good&quot;, and for some speakers also &quot;angry, evil&quot;. When these adjectives are used attributively, the case and number of the adjective matches that of the noun it is an attribute of (as in for example Finnish). As an example, take the sentence &quot; (English: &quot;She has done me a good deed.&quot;&quot;). Here, is inflected in the accusative as to match .

====Comparison====


===Pronouns and determiners===

====Personal pronouns====

The personal pronouns inflect irregularly, and also have a third number, the dual (&quot;guvttiidlohku&quot;). The dual is used to refer to exactly two people. The following table shows the forms.

====Demonstratives====

The five demonstrative determiners/pronouns inflect somewhat irregularly as well. The nominative singular and nominative plural are identical, and some other cases have endings not found in nouns.

When these words modify a noun rather than standing alone, the demonstrative is in the same case as the noun, with the following exceptions:
* A noun in the illative or locative singular is preceded by a demonstrative in the accusative/genitive singular form.
* A noun in the comitative plural is preceded by a demonstrative in either the comitative or the accusative/genitive plural form.

====Interrogatives====

The interrogative/relative pronouns/determiners &quot;gii&quot; &quot;who&quot; and &quot;mii&quot; &quot;what&quot; are likewise irregular.

In the accusative singular of &quot;mii&quot;, there are two possible forms. The &quot;regular&quot; form &quot;man&quot; is used when there is an implication of a choice from a limited number of options. The form &quot;máid&quot; has no such implication.

These two pronouns, as well as other interrogatives (which inflect regularly) can act as determiners and modify nouns. The rules for which case to use are the same as for the demonstrative. The form &quot;máid&quot; is followed by a noun in the accusative plural form.

====Reflexive pronoun====

The reflexive pronoun is &quot;ieš&quot; (dual and plural &quot;ieža&quot;), meaning &quot;myself&quot;, &quot;yourself&quot;, &quot;himself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot; and so on. In its base form, the pronoun occurs only in the nominative case and is never used on its own; it always occurs next to the subject of the sentence, where it acts as an adverb to strengthen it. Compare for example sentences such as &quot;I myself have never seen it.&quot;.

The other cases can occur by themselves, but only in the singular, and are always used in combination with a possessive suffix that matches the subject of the sentence (i.e. always &quot;I see myself&quot;, never &quot;I see himself&quot;). These forms are irregular as well as suppletive: the illative and locative forms derive from completely different roots. There are also several alternative stems.

===Verbs===

====Finite verbal categories====
The conjugation of Northern Sámi verbs resembles that of Finnish. There are three grammatical persons (&quot;persovnnat&quot;), and three grammatical numbers (&quot;logut&quot;), singular, dual and plural. There are four or five grammatical moods (&quot;vuogit&quot;):
* indicative (&quot;indikatiiva&quot; or &quot;duohtavuohki&quot;), indicating real events or statements of fact.
* imperative (&quot;imperatiiva&quot; or &quot;gohččunvuohki&quot;), indicating commands.
* optative (&quot;optatiiva&quot; or &quot;ávžžuhusvuohki&quot;), indicating wishes, things that the speaker would like to see done or realised. The optative is not usually considered a distinct mood, but is generally combined with the imperative.
* conditional (&quot;konditionála&quot; or &quot;eaktovuohki&quot;), indicating conditional or hypothetical statements, like the English subjunctive and the verb &quot;would&quot;.
* potential (&quot;potientiála&quot; or &quot;veadjinvuohki&quot;), indicating ability or possibility.

Tense is also distinguished, but only in the indicative. There are two tenses (&quot;tempusat&quot;):
* present (&quot;preseansa&quot; or &quot;dálá áigi&quot;), which is also used for future events (nonpast tense).
* past (&quot;preterihtta&quot; or &quot;vássán áigi&quot;).

In addition, each mood and tense has a so-called connegative form. This form is used in negative sentences, when combined with the negative verb.

====Non-finite verbal categories====
Finally, there are several non-finite forms.

=====Infinitive=====
The infinitive is the dictionary form of the verb.

=====Present participle=====
The present participle is an adjective indicating a current or ongoing action. It is identical in form to the agent noun, and has the same origin. However, the participle has only an attributive form, no case forms.
* &quot;oađˈđi mánná&quot; – a sleeping child
* &quot;áhpásmeaddji buohcci&quot; – a recovering patient

=====Past participle=====
The past participle is an adjective indicating a past or completed action. Like the present participle, it has only an attributive form. It is also used in forming the periphrastic perfect tense, and as the connegative form of the past indicative.
* &quot;oađđán mánná&quot; – child who slept
* &quot;áhpásman buohcci&quot; – patient who recovered

=====Agent participle=====
The agent participle is an adjective indicating a past or completed action that has been completed by a particular agent. It only exists for transitive verbs. The agent precedes the participle and is in the genitive case, much like its Finnish counterpart:
* &quot;áhči čállin reive&quot; – the letter written by the father

=====Negative participle=====
The negative participle is an adjective indicating an action that has not been done by or to something. It can be either active or passive in meaning.
* &quot;logakeahtẹs reive&quot; – unread letter
* &quot;jugakeahtẹs vuola&quot; – undrunk beer
* &quot;muitalkeahtẹs muitalus&quot; – untold story

=====Action noun=====
The action noun is a noun which indicates the action itself. It is not a verb form as such, but is often used in verbal constructions.

=====Action inessive=====
The action inessive (also called the &quot;action essive&quot;) indicates &quot;in (the process of)&quot; or &quot;while&quot;. It is used together with the copula &quot;leat&quot; to express a current, ongoing action, much like the English continuous.
* &quot;mánná lea oađđimin&quot; – the child is sleeping
* &quot;mun lean juhkamin vuola&quot; – I am drinking beer

The action inessive originates in the inessive case of the action noun, a case which no longer exists for nouns in Northern Sámi.

=====Action elative=====
The action elative (also called the &quot;action locative&quot;) indicates &quot;from (the action of)&quot;. It is used to indicate the cessation of an action, but is also required idiomatically by certain verbs.

* &quot;mun vajálduhtin oađđimis&quot; – I forgot to sleep

The action elative originates in the elative case of the action noun, a case which became the locative in regular nouns.

=====Action comitative=====
The action comitative indicates &quot;through&quot; or &quot;by&quot;. It originates in the comitative case of the action noun.

=====Purposive converb=====
The purposive converb expresses &quot;in order to&quot;.

=====Simultaneous converb=====
The simultaneous converb expresses that an action took place &quot;during&quot; or &quot;while (doing)&quot; another one. It is always accompanied by a possessive suffix.

=====Negative converb=====
The negative converb (also called the &quot;verb abessive&quot;) expresses &quot;without&quot;.

=====Verb genitive=====
The verb genitive is an adverbial form often used to indicate the way/method, accompanied by a verb of motion. It only exists for some verbs and is not very productive, so it is better considered a derivational form rather than an inflectional form.

=====Supine=====
The supine expresses &quot;in order to&quot;. It is only used in western Northern Sámi dialects.

====Verbs with even inflection====


====Verbs with odd inflection====
====Verbs with contracted inflection====

====Negative verb====
Northern Sámi, like other Uralic languages, has a negative verb that conjugates according to mood (indicative and imperative), person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural). It does not conjugate according to tense.

===Numbers===

Northern Sámi uses a decimal numeral system. Cardinal numbers inflect like adjectives, but have no attributive form. Instead, the numeral matches the noun it modifies in case and number. All numerals except for &quot;okta&quot; (1) use the nominative singular form also for the accusative singular (both are in the same consonant grade). For &quot;čieža&quot; (7), &quot;gávcci&quot; (8), &quot;ovcci&quot; (9), &quot;logi&quot; (10) and &quot;čuođi&quot; (100), the genitive singular form is used also for the nominative and accusative singular (they are all in the weak grade). In the plural, they inflect like all other nominals.

====0-10====
The numbers from 0 to 10 are:

====11-19====
The numbers 11 to 19 are formed by compounding a number from 1 to 9 with &quot;-nuppẹlohkái&quot; (literally &quot;into the second ten&quot;).

====20-99====

The numbers 20 to 90 are formed by simply compounding the multiple with &quot;logi&quot;.

Combinations of a decade and a unit are constructed by compounding the decade with the unit directly, as in English. For example:

* 28 &quot;guoktẹlogigávcci&quot;
* 83 &quot;gávccilogigolbma&quot;
* 99 &quot;ovccilogiovcci&quot;

There is also a traditional number system that functions similarly to the numbers 11-19 where the unit comes first, followed by and ordinal number and the word , i.e. &quot;into the &quot;n&quot;th ten&quot;:

* 21 &quot;oktagoalmmátlohkái&quot; &quot;one into the third ten&quot;
* 31 &quot;oktanjealjátlohkái&quot; &quot;one into the fourth ten&quot;

====Hundreds====

100 is &quot;čuođi&quot;. Multiples of 100 are expressed like multiples of 10, by simple compounding: 200 &quot;guoktẹčuođi&quot;, 300 &quot;golbmačuođi&quot; and so on. Combinations of a hundred and a lower number follow the same pattern, again by compounding, with the hundred coming first.

* 112 &quot;čuođiguoktẹnuppelohkái&quot;
* 698 &quot;guhttačuođiovccilogigávcci&quot;
* 999 &quot;ovccičuođiovccilogiovcci&quot;

====Thousands====

1000 is &quot;duhát&quot;. The pattern is the same as with the hundreds.

* 5 203 &quot;vihttaduhátguoktẹčuođigolbma&quot;
* 9 001 &quot;ovcciduhátokta&quot;
* 32 348 &quot;golbmalogiduhátgolbmačuođinjealljẹlogigávcci&quot;
* 123 456 &quot;čuođiguoktẹlogigolbmaduhátnjealljẹčuođivihttalogiguhtta&quot;

====Millions and above====

Northern Sámi uses the long scale system.

* 1 000 000 &quot;miljovdna&quot;
* 1 000 000 000 &quot;miljárda&quot;
* 1 000 000 000 000 &quot;biljovdna&quot;
* 1 000 000 000 000 000 &quot;biljárda&quot;
* etc.

Combinations with lower numbers are much the same as with the thousands. Multiples use the accusative/genitive forms &quot;miljovnna&quot; and &quot;miljárdda&quot; instead.

* 117 401 067 &quot;čuođilogičiežamiljovnnanjealljẹčuođioktaduhátguhttalogičieža&quot;
* 10 987 654 321 &quot;logimiljárddaovccičuođigávccilogičiežamiljovnnaguhttačuođivihttaloginjealljẹduhátgolbmačuođiguoktẹlogiokta&quot;

====Ordinal numbers====

Ordinal numbers behave and inflect like regular adjectives. Except for &quot;nubbi&quot;, they have an attributive form, which is identical to the nominative singular.

For the vast majority of numbers, the ordinal form is created by suffixing &quot;-t&quot;, and putting the stem in the weak grade. The final vowel of the stem is often altered as well.

When a number is composed of multiple parts, only the last one is converted to an ordinal, the rest stay in their cardinal form. Thus, 13th &quot;golbmanuppẹlogát&quot;, 22nd &quot;guoktẹloginubbi&quot;, 409th &quot;njealljẹčuođiovccát&quot;, 9001st &quot;ovcciduhátvuosttaš&quot;.

==Syntax==

Northern Sámi is, like English, an SVO language.

<doc id="1169509" wikidata="Q5096888" url="?curid=1169509" title="Pocatello (Shoshone leader)">
<text>Chief Pocatello (known in the Shoshoni language as Tondzaosha (Buffalo Robe); 1815 – October 1884) was a leader of the Northern Shoshone, a Native American people of the Great Basin in western North America. He led attacks against early settlers during a time of increasing strife between settlers and Native Americans. After making peace with the U.S. Government, he moved his people to their present reservation in Idaho and led the Shoshone during their struggle to survive following their deportation. The city of Pocatello is named in his honor.

==Biography==
Pocatello was born 1815. He was the leader at the time of the United States&#x27; arrival into Utah in the late 1840s. In the 1850s, he led a series of attacks against emigrant parties in the Utah Territory and along the Oregon Trail. He gained a reputation among Mormon leaders and Indian agents as a leader of a band of Native Americans. Brigham Young, the leader of the Mormons, attempted a policy of reconciliation and appeasement of the Shoshone, but the arrival of the United States Army in the Utah Territory in 1858 exacerbated tensions between the emigrants and the Shoshone.

In January 1863, Pocatello received advance notice of the advance of U.S. Army troops from Fort Douglas under Colonel Patrick Edward Connor, who had set out to &quot;chastise&quot; the Shoshone. Pocatello was able to lead his people out of harm&#x27;s way from the Army, thus avoiding the catastrophe of the Bear River Massacre. Pocatello sued for peace after pursuit from the Army. Pocatello agreed to cease his attacks on Oregon Trail emigrants and southeast Idaho settlers if the government would provide compensation for the game and land preempted by these intruders on the tribe&#x27;s ancestral territory. With the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868, the chief agreed to relocate his people to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation along the Snake River. Although the U.S. government had promised $5,000 in annual supplies, the relief rarely arrived, forcing continuing suffering and struggle among the Shoshone.

In 1875, faced with starvation among his people, Pocatello led them to the Mormon missionary farm of George Hill in Corinne, Utah, with the hope that a mass conversion of his people to Mormonism would alleviate his people&#x27;s suffering. Although the missionaries willingly baptized the Shoshone, the local population of white settlers did not receive the Shoshone openly and agitated for their expulsion. In response, the U.S. Army forced the Shoshone to return to the Fort Hall Reservation.

In the late 1870s Pocatello granted a right-of-way to Jay Gould to extend the Utah and Northern Railway across the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. The extension of the railroad was motivated by the increasing flood of settlers into the Idaho Territory following the discovery of gold. 

After his death in 1884, Pocatello&#x27;s body was interred in a deep spring in Idaho along with his clothing, guns, knives, and hunting equipment. Eighteen horses were also slaughtered and put into the spring on top of his body.

==Name==
In 1918, John E. Rees published a list of Idaho place names called &quot;Idaho Nomenclature&quot;. His derivation of &quot;Pokatello&quot; included &quot;po&quot; &quot;road,&quot; &quot;ka&quot; &quot;not,&quot; and &quot;tello&quot; &quot;to follow,&quot; and Rees offered the meaning &quot;he does not follow the road,&quot; referring to the chief&#x27;s &quot;stealthy habits and thieving raids.&quot; An earlier reference to &quot;Pocataro&quot; occurred in 1859, when F. W. Lander, Superintendent of the U.S. Overland Wagon Road, met Chief Pocatello and arranged his release from U.S. Army custody. Linguist Sven Liljeblad believed that Lander&#x27;s encounter with Chief Pocatello was the first reference to the name. Liljeblad refuted John Rees&#x27; syllabic derivation of the name, reasoning that Rees had simply connected unrelated Shoshoni roots. Liljeblad concluded that Pocatello was not even a Shoshoni word. Chief Pocatello&#x27;s daughter, Jeanette Lewis, confirmed that the name had no meaning in the Shoshoni language, and that the chief referred to himself as Tondzaosha, meaning &quot;buffalo robe.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Pocatello appears in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot; as the playable leader of the Shoshone Civilization.

<text>The first Locomotives of the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) were specified by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but Daniel Gooch was soon appointed as the railway&#x27;s Locomotive Superintendent. He designed several different broad gauge types for the growing railway, such as the Firefly and later Iron Duke Class. In 1864 Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong who brought his standard gauge experience to the workshops at Swindon. To replace some of the earlier locomotives, he put broad gauge wheels on his standard gauge locomotives and from this time on all locomotives were given numbers, including the broad gauge ones that had previously carried just names.

Joseph Armstrong&#x27;s early death in 1877 meant that the next phase of motive power design was the responsibility of William Dean, his assistant and successor. Dean went on to develop express 4-4-0 types, but the familiar 4-6-0s of later years were initially introduced by the next engineer, George Jackson Churchward. He was also responsible for the introduction of self-propelled Steam Rail Motors for suburban and light branch line passenger trains. Next came Charles Collett in 1921; he standardised the many types of locomotives then in service, producing the iconic Castle and Kings. He also introduced diesel power in the form of streamlined rail cars in 1934. The final engineer was Frederick Hawksworth who took control in 1941 and produced GWR-design locomotives until after nationalisation in 1948.

The GWR expanded rapidly from 1854 by amalgamating with other railways. In 1876 most of the remaining broad gauge companies became a part of the GWR. The Railways Act 1921 finally brought most of the remaining independent companies in the area under its control. Many early locomotives were replaced by standard GWR designs, but many others were rebuilt using standardised components.

==Livery==

For most of the period of its existence, the GWR painted its locomotives a middle chrome green. They initially had Indian red frames but this was later changed to black. Nameplates and numberplates were generally of polished brass with a black background, and chimneys often had copper or brass rims, often referred to as &quot;caps&quot;.

==Great Western Railway locomotives==

===Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1835–1837)===
The GWR&#x27;s first locomotives were specified by Isambard Kingdom Brunel but did not prove too successful. He had provided manufacturers with a number of requirements (including a piston speed of no more than at a running speed of , and a maximum weight in working order of on six wheels), and left each manufacturer the freedom to produce designs that would meet those requirements; even with that freedom, these manufacturers found the task difficult. In order to meet his demands some novel ideas were tried such as the Haigh Foundry&#x27;s geared locomotives and TE Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot; which had the engine and boiler on separate chassis.

* Haigh Foundry 2-2-2s – two delivered in 1838: &quot;Snake&quot; and &quot;Viper&quot;
* R and W Hawthorn locomotives – two delivered in 1838: &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot;
* Mather, Dixon 2-2-2s – six delivered in 1837–40: &quot;Premier&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot;, etc.
* Sharp, Roberts 2-2-2s – three delivered in 1838: &quot;Atlas&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Lion&quot;
* Robert Stephenson locomotives – two delivered in 1837–39: &quot;Morning Star&quot; and &quot;North Star&quot;
* Charles Tayleur 2-2-2s – six delivered in 1837–38: &quot;Vulcan&quot;, &quot;Apollo&quot;, etc.

The two &quot;Star&quot; class locomotives were not designed to meet Brunel&#x27;s specifications – they were bought from Stephenson&#x27;s surplus stock after another railway had been unable to pay for them. They proved to be the best of the early locomotives, so much so that more of the same design were ordered, and they were used by Gooch as the basis for some of his subsequent designs.

===Daniel Gooch (1837–1864)===
More conventional locomotives were soon ordered by Daniel Gooch when he was appointed as the railway&#x27;s Locomotive Superintendent. Following on from the Star Class that he ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company, he designed a series of standardised and successful locomotive types starting with the Firefly and Sun classes of passenger locomotives, and the Leo and Hercules classes for goods trains. By 1846, Swindon Works had been established and was able to build its own locomotives. The most familiar from this period are the Iron Duke Class with their driving wheels, a type that operated express trains right up to the end of the broad gauge in 1892. Gooch further developed the broad gauge locomotive fleet, producing the first bogie tank design for the steep and curving South Devon lines in 1849, and condensing locomotives for the Metropolitan Railway in 1862. He produced over 100 Ariadne class goods locomotives to a standardised design at a time when most classes ran to only ten or twenty locomotives, and components he designed were often interchangeable between different classes.

With the acquisition of the northern standard gauge lines in 1854 came 56 locomotives, a second workshop at Wolverhampton, and Joseph Armstrong. Wolverhampton was responsible for maintaining standard gauge locomotives for many years, although Daniel Gooch did design some new locomotives that were built at Swindon and carried to Wolverhampton on special trucks. The first, the 57 class were 0-6-0 goods locomotives built in 1855. At the same time some 69 class passenger locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in Manchester so were able to be transported on their own wheels. By the time that Armstrong replaced Gooch at Swindon in 1864 many more locomotives had been acquired with the Birkenhead and West Midland Railways.

===Joseph Armstrong (Wolverhampton 1854 - 1864, Swindon 1864 - 1877)===
In 1864 Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong who brought his standard gauge experience gained in the Northern Division to bear on the larger broad gauge locomotives. He designed the Hawthorn class of 2-4-0 and, in 1870, started the renewal of the Iron Dukes with more powerful boilers. The conversion of many broad gauge lines to standard gauge meant that this was a period of consolidation but in 1876 the amalgamation of the Bristol and Exeter and South Devon Railway locomotives saw 180 locomotives added to the GWR&#x27;s fleet. To replace some of these earlier locomotives, Armstrong put broad gauge wheels on his standard gauge 1076 Class and from this time on GWR locomotives were given numbers rather than the names that had been carried by broad gauge locomotives up till then.

Armstrong developed the 2-2-2 as his preferred express locomotive, producing 30 of the Sir Daniel class from 1866 and 21 of the Queen class from 1873. Smaller 2-4-0s, such as the 439 class of 1868, worked slower passenger trains while 0-6-0s, such as the 388 class, continued to operate freight trains. Tank locomotives were constructed to operate lighter trains and branch lines, the most familiar of which were the 1076 &quot;Buffalo&quot; class 0-6-0STs (later 0-6-0PT), and the 455 &quot;Metro&quot; class 2-4-0Ts.

===George Armstrong (Wolverhampton 1864 - 1897)===
After his brother was promoted to Swindon, George Armstrong took his place at Wolverhampton and for the next 33 years continued to repair, rebuild and build standard-gauge locomotives in a spirit of independence from Swindon, just as Joseph had done during his own ten years at Wolverhampton. Most of the new locomotives built there were tank engines, some of them very long-lived; a few even survived the Second World War.
===William Dean (1877 - 1902)===
Joseph Armstrong&#x27;s early death in 1877 meant that the final phase of broad gauge motive power was the responsibility of William Dean. He continued the Iron Duke renewal programme and added more convertibles, including some of Armstrong&#x27;s 388 class goods locomotives. He also developed some elegant express locomotives such as the 3031 Class singles. Following the abandonment of the broad gauge on 20 May 1892 the majority of the remaining 195 broad gauge locomotives were taken to &quot;the dump&quot; at Swindon. Most of the convertible locomotives were altered to run on the standard gauge over the following 18 months while the remainder were cut up.

Dean had worked under Armstrong on and off for 22 years before becoming his successor and he perpetuated his locomotive policy for some time. He later produced standardised 0-6-0 and 2-6-0 goods locomotives (the 2301 and 2600 &quot;Aberdare&quot; classes), and 0-6-0STs of various sizes (the 2021 and 2721 classes). For express trains he initially developed the 2-2-2 type, culminating with the elegant 3031 class. He later moved on to the 4-4-0 type, producing the Badminton and Atbara classes with wheels, and the Duke and Bulldog classes with wheels. For branch line and suburban trains he built 31 3600 class 2-4-2T locomotives.

===George Jackson Churchward (1902–1922)===

George Jackson Churchward started his railway career in the South Devon Railway locomotive workshops at Newton Abbot. After that company became a part of the GWR in 1876 he was sent to Swindon and worked under Armstrong and Dean. After his appointment as Locomotive Superintendent in 1902 he developed a series of standard locomotive types with flat-topped Belpaire fireboxes, tapered boilers, long smokeboxes, boiler top feeds, long-lap long-travel valve gear, and many standardised parts such as wheels, cylinders and connecting rods.

For express passenger trains he quickly turned out the City class of 4-4-0s, the first taking to the rails in 1903. The following year one of these, 3717 &quot;City of Truro&quot;, was reputedly the first locomotive in the world to exceed 100 mph. A larger 4-4-0 was produced in 1904 in the form of the County class, but further increases in size demanded more wheels.

Experiments had already been made for a 4-6-0 design while Dean was still in charge, and these continued under Churchward; the first 4-6-0, number 100, appeared in 1902 as the initial prototype of what became the Saint class. One locomotive was converted to a 4-4-2 for direct trials against French designs that he tried on the GWR in 1903. These experiments moved the GWR towards using four cylinders and they even tried a 4-6-2, 111 &quot;The Great Bear&quot; which was the first locomotive of this type in the United Kingdom. Production 4-6-0s appeared in 1905 as the two-cylinder Saint class, and were followed in 1906 by the four-cylinder Star class. A freight version of the Saint, the 2-8-0 2800 class was introduced in 1903. For lighter trains a series of 2-6-0s were turned out in 1911, the 4300 class, which were to become the most numerous GWR tender locomotives. In 1919 this design was enlarged to become the 4700 class 2-8-0s.

Churchward&#x27;s standardisation aims meant that a number of tank locomotives were produced that were based on these tender locomotives. The 2221 class of 1905 were a 4-4-2 tank version of the County class, indeed they were known as the &quot;County Tanks&quot;. These were then developed into a 2-6-2T design, being produced as the 3100 class in 1903 and the 3150 class three years later. Smaller 2-6-2Ts, the 4400 class were introduced in 1904 and were succeeded by the slightly larger 4500 class in 1906. Two very different freight tank locomotive types appeared in 1910. The 4200 class was a tank version of the 2800 class, but a demand for small locomotives for working on dock and branch lines was met by the 1361 class, a new design based on the old Cornwall Minerals Railway 0-6-0ST design but using as many of Churchward&#x27;s standard parts as possible.

Other innovations during Churchward&#x27;s office included the introduction of self-propelled Steam Rail Motors for suburban and light branch line passenger trains. From 1915 his post was renamed that of the &#x27;Chief Mechanical Engineer&#x27;. He also remodelled Swindon Works, building the boiler-erecting shops and the first static locomotive-testing plant in the United Kingdom.


===Charles Collett (1922-1941)===
Charles Collett became the Chief Mechanical Engineer in 1921. Almost straight away he had to take on all the locomotives of myriad types from the railways absorbed in 1922 and 1923. Many of these were &#x27;Swindonised&#x27;, that is they were rebuilt using standard GWR parts. He also set about designing many new types to replace the older examples. Many of the most familiar GWR tank locomotive classes were designed during this period: the 1400 class for small branch lines and auto trains; the 4575 class (a development of the 4500 class with larger tanks) and the large 6100 class 2-6-2Ts; the massive 7200 class of rebuilt 4200 class 2-8-2Ts; and the iconic pannier tanks of the 5700 class, the first of which appeared in 1929.

Collett further developed the 4-6-0 type as the ideal GWR express locomotive, extending the Stars into Castles in 1923, and then producing the largest of them all, the four-cylinder King class, in 1927. He also produced slightly smaller types for mixed traffic (either passenger and goods) duties, the Hall class in 1928, the Grange class in 1934, and the Manor class in 1934. All these continued to carry appropriate names. For lighter goods services he produced his own standard 0-6-0, the 2251 class.

It was under Collett&#x27;s control that diesel power first appeared on the GWR. He introduced the first streamlined rail cars in 1934 and by 1942 38 had been built, although the latter ones had more angular styling. Some were configured for long distance express services with buffet counters, others for branch line or parcels work, and some were designed as two-car sets.

===Frederick Hawksworth (1941-1949)===
Frederick Hawksworth only became the Chief Mechanical Engineer in 1941 and the Second World War meant that his new designs were few. He updated Collett&#x27;s Hall class to produce the GWR 6959 Class, known as &quot;Modified Halls&quot;, and produced the last GWR 2-cylinder 4-6-0s, the County class 4-6-0, which ended a tradition that had begun with the Saint class 42 years before. Their boilers were based on those of the LMS Stanier Class 8F 2-8-0, a number of which had been built at Swindon during the War. Other designs included three designs of 0-6-0PT: the taper boilered 9400 class; the 1500 class with outside Walschaerts valve gear and no running plate designed for pilot work around large stations; and the very light 1600 Class. Hawksworth had intended to introduce a fleet of Pacifics dubbed the Cathedral class, but this was abandoned.

===West Cornwall Railway===
The eight West Cornwall Railway broad gauge locomotives were operated in a common pool with the South Devon Railway locomotives and are detailed in that section, above. At the same time, 1 February 1876, another eight standard gauge locomotives were also acquired. These were renumbered 1384 – 1391.
* 1384 Robert Stephenson and Company 2-4-0
* 1385 Robert Stephenson and Company 0-6-0

==Locomotives from the ROD (1919 - 1925)==
In 1919, the GWR purchased 20 ROD 2-8-0 locomotives from the Railway Operating Division. These were based on Robinson&#x27;s GCR Class 8K. Another 84 locomotives of the same class were hired in 1919–20 but were returned in 1921–22. In 1925, a further 80 locomotives of the same class were purchased, of which nineteen were among those previously hired.

* 3000 Class (2-8-0): 3000–3099

==Locomotives of amalgamated companies (1920 - 1924)==
Eighteen companies were merged between 1 January 1922 and 1 January 1924 under the provisions of the Railways Act 1921, bringing 925 locomotives.

===Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway===
39 locomotives acquired on 1 January 1922.
===Barry Railway===
148 Barry Railway locomotives acquired on 1 January 1922 and given random numbers in several series.
===Brecon and Merthyr Railway===
47 locomotives acquired on 1 July 1922.
===Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway===
15 locomotives acquired on 1 July 1922.
===Cambrian Railways===
94 standard gauge locomotives acquired on 1 January 1922 given random numbers in various series..
====Vale of Rheidol Railway====
Three gauge locomotives acquired with the Cambrian Railways on 1 January 1922, also two new locomotives, similar to the earlier 2-6-2Ts, built in 1923.
====Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway====
Two gauge 0-6-0T locomotives acquired with the Cambrian Railways on 1 January 1922.
===Cardiff Railway===
36 locomotives acquired on 1 January 1922.
===Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway===
Two locomotives were acquired on 1 January 1922
===Gwendraeth Valleys Railway===
2 0-6-0ST locomotives were acquired on 1 January 1923. One was given a GWR number, but the second (&quot;Margaret&quot;) was sold without being allocated a GWR number.
===Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway===
8 locomotives acquired on 1 January 1923.
===Midland and South Western Junction Railway===
The M&amp;SWJR&#x27;s Locomotive Superintendent from 1903 to 1923 was James Tyrell.

29 locomotives acquired on 1 January 1923.

The three Dübs 2-4-0s were the only M&amp;SWJR locomotives to survive into British Railways ownership in 1948. At least one of them was used on the Lambourn Valley Railway, probably because of its light axle load.

===Neath and Brecon Railway===
15 locomotives acquired on 1 July 1922.
===Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company===
22 locomotives acquired on 1 January 1922.
===Powlesland and Mason===

===Taff Vale Railway===
The Taff Vale Railway and its 275 locomotives were acquired on 1 January 1922.
==Locomotives of amalgamated companies (1925 - 1947)==

===Corris Railway===
Two narrow gauge locomotives acquired when the Corris Railway was bought from Imperial Tramways in 1929:
*No. 3 &quot;Sir Haydn&quot; 
*No. 4 &quot;Edward Thomas&quot; 

===Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway===
Two locomotives were transferred to the Great Western Railway when Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway closed in 1940:
* GWR No.5 ex-LB&amp;SCR A1 Class 0-6-0T &quot;Portishead&quot;
* GWR No.6 ex-LB&amp;SCR A1 Class 0-6-0T

===Ystalyfera Tin Works===
* GWR No.1 Peckett and Sons 0-4-0ST &quot;Hercules&quot;

==1948 and after==
On 1 January 1948 all existing GWR locomotives became the property of the new British Railways (BR); unlike other companies stock, all the steam locomotives continued to carry their GWR numbers. BR continued to build GWR designs (the 1000, 1500, 1600, 4073 and 6959 classes in particular) for a while. When the first BR Standard steam locomotives started to arrive, they were often compared unfavourably to ex-GWR locos, and the Western Region decided to take forward experiments with diesel-hydraulic and gas turbine locomotives.

Withdrawal of ex-GWR locomotives took place earlier than for the other &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies as the Western Region took the decision to be the first to end steam traction. A handful of locomotives that had been transferred to other regions did survive for longer however. Ironically, because the Barry scrapyard received large numbers of ex-GWR locomotives, proportionately more survive today in preservation than the locomotives of the other companies.

==Named locomotives==
Most express passenger locomotives carried distinctive names, generally following themes such as kings (the 6000 class), cities (3700 class), counties (3800 class, later the 1000 class), castles (4073 class), and halls (4900 class). This tradition dated back to the first locomotives delivered to the railway, for all broad gauge locomotives initially were identified only by names, numbers first appearing on the standard gauge locomotives acquired with the northern companies that became part of the GWR in 1862.

Several locomotives were honoured with the name &quot;Great Western&quot;. The first was an Iron Duke class broad gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company&#x27;s Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a modernised version of the same class was built and given the same name; this was withdrawn just four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the &quot;Great Western&quot; name. The final GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry while working for British Railways. The tradition of using this name has continued with British Rail and modern companies up to the present day.

== Preservation ==

More than 140 Great Western locomotives (including some designed by the GWR but built by British Railways) have been preserved. They are mostly in museums or on heritage railways in the United Kingdom, predominantly in the area formerly served by the GWR. Some locomotives that were absorbed in the 1923 grouping also survive today. 

=== Dean designed locomotives ===
=== Churchward designed locomotives ===

* Named in preservation

=== Collett designed locomotives ===

Collet also built or rebuilt the Vale Of Rheidol locomotives listed under § Narrow gauge locomotives.

=== Hawksworth designed locomotives ===
=== Amalgamated/pre-grouping locomotives ===
Nine pre-grouping locomotives that were absorbed into the GWR in 1923 are known to survive: 
*Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway 0-6-0ST built by Fox, Walker &amp; Company in 1878, NP&amp;FR in 1894, GVR in 1911, GWR No. 1378. 
*Alexandra Docks 0-4-0ST &quot;Trojan&quot; built by Avonside in 1897, GWR No. 1340. 
*Taff Vale Railway O1 class 0-6-2T No. 28 built by TVR Cardiff West in 1897, GWR No. 450. 
*Cardiff Railway 0-4-0ST No. 5 built by Kitson &amp; Co in 1898, GWR No. 1338. 
*Taff Vale Railway O2 class 0-6-2T No. 85 built by Neilson, Reid &amp; Co. in 1899, GWR No. 426. 
*Port Talbot Railway 0-6-0ST No. 26 built by Hudswell Clarke in 1900, GWR No. 813
*Powlesland and Mason 0-4-0ST No. 6 built by Brush Electrical in 1906, GWR No. 921. 
*Swansea Harbour Trust 0-4-0ST No. 13 built by Hawthorn Leslie in 1909, GWR No. 974.

*BP&amp;GVR No.2 Pontyberem was sold in 1914 by the company and into industrial use and therefore didn&#x27;t pass into GWR ownership but was based at DRC for a while.

=== Narrow gauge locomotives ===
Three locomotives of gauge were acquired from the Vale of Rheidol Railway as part of the Cambrian Railways at the grouping, but only one survived to be privatised from British Rail in 1989:
*2-6-2T VoR no. 2 (originally named &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;) built by Davies and Metcalfe in 1902, to GWR no. 1213 in 1922, rebuilt 1924, renumbered 9 by British Railways in 1949 and named &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in 1956. Still in service.
Two more, similar to no. 1213 as rebuilt, were built by the GWR at Swindon in 1923:
*2-6-2T No. 7 built by GWR in 1923, named &quot;Owain Glyndŵr&quot; in 1956 by British Railways
*2-6-2T No. 8 built by GWR in 1923, named &quot;Llywelyn&quot; in 1956 by British Railways
These two, together with no. 9, are still running on their original line.

From the gauge Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, absorbed into the GWR as part of the Cambrian Railways at the grouping:
*0-6-0T No 822 &quot;The Earl&quot; built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. in 1902, preserved as No 822 &quot;The Earl&quot; on the WLLR
*0-6-0T No 823 &quot;The Countess&quot; (renamed &quot;Countess&quot; by GWR) built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. in 1902, preserved as No 823 &quot;Countess&quot; on the WLLR

From the gauge Corris Railway, which was purchased by the GWR in 1930:
*0-4-2ST No. 3 built by Hughes Falcon in 1878, preserved as No. 3 &quot;Sir Haydn&quot; on the Talyllyn Railway.
*0-4-2ST No. 4 built by Kerr, Stuart and Company in 1921, preserved as No. 4 &quot;Edward Thomas&quot; on the Talyllyn Railway.

=== New-build steam ===
The last engine of GWR design built by British Railways was 1600 class No 1669 in May 1955. However, as the railway preservation movement grew, and many types of locomotive were preserved, some people conceived the idea of reconstructing locomotives of classes that had not survived - even in scrapyards - long enough to be preserved. In the early 1970s, the Great Western Society acquired &#x27;Hall&#x27; class No 4942 &quot;Maindy Hall&quot;, in order use it as a basis for reconstructing a &#x27;Saint&#x27; class locomotive, the last of which had been scrapped in 1953. More recently, a number of other GWR engine classes have been or are being reconstructed, often taking advantage of the strong standardisation of the Swindon designs to use spare parts from other types. Operational replicas of two broad gauge engines have also been built.

A non-steaming replica of &quot;North Star&quot; was built by the GWR in 1935 for their centenary. A static replica of Dean single &quot;The Queen&quot; was created for Madame Tussauds in 1982.
Sometimes the Railcar No. 93 is included as &#x27;new build steam&#x27;, as the power bogie was constructed from scratch; however, the remainder of the coachwork was an original railcar, preserved as noted above.

<doc id="1169523" wikidata="Q978273" url="?curid=1169523" title="Hybridoma technology">
<text>Hybridoma technology is a method for producing large numbers of identical antibodies, also called monoclonal antibodies. This process starts by injecting a mouse (or other mammal) with an antigen that provokes an immune response. A type of white blood cell, the B cell, produces antibodies that bind to the injected antigen. These antibody producing B-cells are then harvested from the mouse and, in turn, fused with immortal myeloma cancer cells, to produce a hybrid cell line called a &quot;hybridoma&quot;, which has both the antibody-producing ability of the B-cell and the longevity and reproductivity of the myeloma. 

The hybridomas can be grown in culture, each culture starting with one viable hybridoma cell, producing cultures each of which consists of genetically identical hybridomas which produce one antibody per culture (monoclonal) rather than mixtures of different antibodies (polyclonal). The myeloma cell line that is used in this process is selected for its ability to grow in tissue culture and for an absence of antibody synthesis. In contrast to polyclonal antibodies, which are mixtures of many different antibody molecules, the monoclonal antibodies produced by each hybridoma line are all chemically identical.

The production of monoclonal antibodies was invented by César Milstein and Georges J. F. Köhler in 1975. They shared the Nobel Prize of 1984 for Medicine and Physiology with Niels Kaj Jerne, who made other contributions to immunology. The term hybridoma was coined by Leonard Herzenberg during his sabbatical in César Milstein&#x27;s laboratory in 1976–1977.

== Method ==


Laboratory animals (mammals, e.g. mice) are first exposed to the antigen against which an antibody is to be generated. Usually this is done by a series of injections of the antigen in question, over the course of several weeks. These injections are typically followed by the use of in vivo electroporation, which significantly enhances the immune response. Once splenocytes are isolated from the mammal&#x27;s spleen, the B cells are fused with immortalised myeloma cells. The fusion of the B cells with myeloma cells can be done using electrofusion. Electrofusion causes the B cells and myeloma cells to align and fuse with the application of an electric field. Alternatively, the B-cells and myelomas can be made to fuse by chemical protocols, most often using polyethylene glycol. The myeloma cells are selected beforehand to ensure they are not secreting antibody themselves and that they lack the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) gene, making them sensitive (or vulnerable) to the HAT medium (see below).

Fused cells are incubated in HAT medium (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine medium) for roughly 10 to 14 days. Aminopterin blocks the pathway that allows for nucleotide synthesis. Hence, unfused myeloma cells die, as they cannot produce nucleotides by the &quot;de novo&quot; or salvage pathways because they lack HGPRT. Removal of the unfused myeloma cells is necessary because they have the potential to outgrow other cells, especially weakly established hybridomas. Unfused B cells die as they have a short life span. In this way, only the B cell-myeloma hybrids survive, since the HGPRT gene coming from the B cells is functional. These cells produce antibodies (a property of B cells) and are immortal (a property of myeloma cells). The incubated medium is then diluted into multi-well plates to such an extent that each well contains only one cell. Since the antibodies in a well are produced by the same B cell, they will be directed towards the same epitope, and are thus monoclonal antibodies.

The next stage is a rapid primary screening process, which identifies and selects only those hybridomas that produce antibodies of appropriate specificity. The first screening technique used is called ELISA. The hybridoma culture supernatant, secondary enzyme labeled conjugate, and chromogenic substrate, are then incubated, and the formation of a colored product indicates a positive hybridoma. Alternatively, immunocytochemical, western blot, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Unlike western blot assays, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry facilitates screening and ranking of clones which bind to the native (non-denaturated) forms of antigen proteins. Flow cytometry screening has been used for primary screening of a large number (~1000) of hybridoma clones recognizing the native form of the antigen on the cell surface. In the flow cytometry-based screening, a mixture of antigen-negative cells and antigen-positive cells is used as the antigen to be tested for each hybridoma supernatant sample. 

The B cell that produces the desired antibodies can be cloned to produce many identical daughter clones. Supplemental media containing interleukin-6 (such as briclone) are essential for this step. Once a hybridoma colony is established, it will continually grow in culture medium like RPMI-1640 (with antibiotics and fetal bovine serum) and produce antibodies.

Multiwell plates are used initially to grow the hybridomas, and after selection, are changed to larger tissue culture flasks. This maintains the well-being of the hybridomas and provides enough cells for cryopreservation and supernatant for subsequent investigations. The culture supernatant can yield 1 to 60 μg/ml of monoclonal antibody, which is maintained at -20 °C or lower until required.

By using culture supernatant or a purified immunoglobulin preparation, further analysis of a potential monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma can be made in terms of reactivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity.

== Applications ==

The use of monoclonal antibodies is numerous and includes the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. For example, monoclonal antibodies can distinguish subsets of B cells and T cells, which is helpful in identifying different types of leukaemias. In addition, specific monoclonal antibodies have been used to define cell surface markers on white blood cells and other cell types. This led to the cluster of differentiation series of markers. These are often referred to as CD markers and define several hundred different cell surface components of cells, each specified by binding of a particular monoclonal antibody. Such antibodies are extremely useful for fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the specific isolation of particular types of cells.

=== In diagnostic histopathology ===
With the help of monoclonal antibodies, tissues and organs can be classified based on their expression of certain defined markers, which reflect tissue or cellular genesis. Prostate specific antigen, placental alkaline phosphatase, human chorionic gonadotrophin, α-fetoprotein and others are organ-associated antigens and the production of monoclonal antibodies against these antigens helps in determining the nature of a primary tumor.

Monoclonal antibodies are especially useful in distinguishing morphologically similar lesions, like pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma, and in the determination of the organ or tissue origin of undifferentiated metastases. Selected monoclonal antibodies help in the detection of occult metastases (cancer of unknown primary origin) by immuno-cytological analysis of bone marrow, other tissue aspirates, as well as lymph nodes and other tissues and can have increased sensitivity over normal histopathological staining.

One study performed a sensitive immuno-histochemical assay on bone marrow aspirates of 20 patients with localized prostate cancer. Three monoclonal antibodies (T16, C26, and AE-1), capable of recognizing membrane and cytoskeletal antigens expressed by epithelial cells to detect tumour cells, were used in the assay. Bone marrow aspirates of 22% of patients with localized prostate cancer (stage B, 0/5; Stage C, 2/4), and 36% patients with metastatic prostate cancer (Stage D1, 0/7 patients; Stage D2, 4/4 patients) had antigen-positive cells in their bone marrow. It was concluded that immuno-histochemical staining of bone marrow aspirates are very useful to detect occult bone marrow metastases in patients with apparently localized prostate cancer.

Although immuno-cytochemistry using tumor-associated monoclonal antibodies has led to an improved ability to detect occult breast cancer cells in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood, further development of this method is necessary before it can be used routinely. One major drawback of immuno-cytochemistry is that only tumor-associated and not tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies are used, and as a result, some cross-reaction with normal cells can occur.

In order to effectively stage breast cancer and assess the efficacy of purging regimens prior to autologous stem cell infusion, it is important to detect even small quantities of breast cancer cells. Immuno-histochemical methods are ideal for this purpose because they are simple, sensitive, and quite specific. Franklin et al. performed a sensitive immuno-cytochemical assay by using a combination of four monoclonal antibodies (260F9, 520C9, 317G5 and BrE-3) against tumor cell surface glycoproteins to identify breast tumour cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. They concluded from the results that immuno-cytochemical staining of bone marrow and peripheral blood is a sensitive and simple way to detect and quantify breast cancer cells.

One of the main reasons for metastatic relapse in patients with solid tumours is the early dissemination of malignant cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for cytokeratins can identify disseminated individual epithelial tumor cells in the bone marrow.

One study 
reports on having developed an immuno-cytochemical procedure for simultaneous labeling of cytokeratin component no. 18 (CK18) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). This would help in the further characterization of disseminated individual epithelial tumor cells in patients with prostate cancer. The twelve control aspirates from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia showed negative staining, which further supports the specificity of CK18 in detecting epithelial tumour cells in bone marrow.

In most cases of malignant disease complicated by effusion, neoplastic cells can be easily recognized. However, in some cases, malignant cells are not so easily seen or their presence is too doubtful to call it a positive report. The use of immuno-cytochemical techniques increases diagnostic accuracy in these cases.

Ghosh, Mason and Spriggs 
analysed 53 samples of pleural or peritoneal fluid from 41 patients with malignant disease. Conventional cytological examination had not revealed any neoplastic cells. Three monoclonal antibodies (anti-CEA, Ca 1 and HMFG-2) were used to search for malignant cells. Immunocytochemical labelling was performed on unstained smears, which had been stored at -20 °C up to 18 months. Twelve of the forty-one cases in which immuno-cytochemical staining was performed, revealed malignant cells. The result represented an increase in diagnostic accuracy of approximately 20%. The study concluded that in patients with suspected malignant disease, immuno-cytochemical labeling should be used routinely in the examination of cytologically negative samples and has important implications with respect to patient management.

Another application of immuno-cytochemical staining is for the detection of two antigens in the same smear. Double staining with light chain antibodies and with T and B cell markers can indicate the neoplastic origin of a lymphoma.

One study has reported the isolation of a hybridoma cell line (clone 1E10), which produces a monoclonal antibody (IgM, k isotype). This monoclonal antibody shows specific immuno-cytochemical staining of nucleoli.

Tissues and tumours can be classified based on their expression of certain markers, with the help of monoclonal antibodies. They help in distinguishing morphologically similar lesions and in determining the organ or tissue origin of undifferentiated metastases. Immuno-cytological analysis of bone marrow, tissue aspirates, lymph nodes etc. with selected monoclonal antibodies help in the detection of occult metastases. Monoclonal antibodies increase the sensitivity in detecting even small quantities of invasive or metastatic cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for cytokeratins can detect disseminated individual epithelial tumour cells in the bone marrow.

<doc id="1169552" wikidata="Q6666012" url="?curid=1169552" title="Locomotives of the Southern Railway (UK)">
<text>The Southern Railway took a key role in expanding the 660 V DC third rail electrified network begun by the London &amp; South Western Railway. As a result of this, and its smaller operating area, its steam locomotive stock was the smallest of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies.

For an explanation of numbering and classification, see British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification.

==Background==
===Post-nationalisation===
British Railways completed construction of the &#x27;West Country&#x27; and &#x27;Merchant Navy&#x27; locomotive designs but did not build any further orders. It abandoned the &#x27;Leader&#x27; class experiments, and Bulleid left the UK to carry forward his unusual locomotive designs in Ireland.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal of ex-SR locomotives happened mainly towards the end of steam on the Southern Region (in 1967), the pre-Grouping designs having gone before then as electrification spread across the region.

==Locomotives of SR design==

With the heavy emphasis on electrification for the London suburban area and the Brighton mainline, there was little need for new steam locomotive designs. The main steam tasks were boat trains (Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven), West of England, Kent services and freight. When designing steam locomotives, the designers had some interesting constraints that dictated where the locomotive could be used. Due to the hangover from SE&amp;CR days, most of the lines in Kent were of fairly light construction and would not take the weight of a modern express locomotive until well into the 1930s. Hence the extensive rebuilding (and new construction) of 4-4-0 designs at a time when other lines were busily building Pacifics or heavy 4-6-0s.

The ex-SER lines also had the problem of the narrow Mountfield and Wadhurst tunnels on the Hastings line, requiring locomotive and rolling stock rather narrower than permitted elsewhere. This problem persisted into British Railways days until eventually the tunnels were single tracked, giving clearance for normal stock.

Services for west of Southampton and Salisbury had a different set of problems as neither the Southern Railway nor its constituents installed water troughs, thus leading to large tenders with greater water capacity than those fitted to similar locomotives on other railways.

New designs were:

===Richard E. L. Maunsell (1923–1937)===

Maunsell also rebuilt, modified or continued the new construction of earlier classes

* LSWR H15 class – Further production
* LSWR N15 class – Further production
* LSWR S15 class – Further production
* LSWR M7 class – One superheated – not repeated
* LSWR T9 class – Superheated
* LSWR 700 class – Superheated
* SECR B1 class
* SECR D class as D1 class
* SECR O class – rebuilt as O1 class
* SECR N class – Further production
* SECR N1 class – Three-cylinder derivative of N class
* LB&amp;SCR C2 class
* LB&amp;SCR L class 4-6-4T – rebuilt as 4–6–0 SR N15X class
* LB&amp;SCR E1 class 0-6-0T – rebuilt as 0-6-2T SR E1/R class
* LB&amp;SCR I1 class – rebuilt as I1X class

===O.V.S. Bulleid (1937–1949)===

Bulleid was also responsible for the mechanical part of the three electric locomotives (CC1–CC3, later British Railways Class 70), built at Ashford Works in 1941 (CC1) and 1948 (CC2, CC3). The electrical part was the responsibility of the Southern Railway&#x27;s Chief Electrical Engineer, Alfred Raworth. Bulleid also designed a 500 hp 0-6-0 diesel mechanical shunter powered by a Davey Paxman power unit. This was built at Ashford Works, though was not introduced until 1950, when it emerged as BR No. 11001.

==Diesel and electric locomotives==
===Diesel shunters===
* The Southern Railway built three diesel shunters in 1937, numbered 1–3. These became British Rail 15201–15203, and were later classified as British Rail Class D3/12.
* Twenty-six similar locomotives were built in 1949–1951 after nationalisation. They were numbered 15211–15236, and were later classified as British Rail Class 12.
* British Rail 11001, Southern Railway design, built 1949 at Ashford Works

===Mainline diesels===
* The Southern designed a prototype class of mainline diesel-electric locomotive. Three were built, although none were finished before nationalisation. They were numbered 10201–10203, and later classified as British Rail Class D16/2.

===Electric shunters===
*The Waterloo and City Railway (later acquired by the LSWR) had two electric shunting locomotives for its 500 V DC line. The first was of Bo wheel arrangement, built by Siemens Brothers &amp; Co in 1893 later numbered 75S. The second was a Bo-Bo, built at Nine Elms Locomotive Works in 1899 and later numbered 74S.

===Mainline electric===
*The Southern Railway also built two mainline electric locomotives numbered CC1 and CC2. They were renumbered 20001 and 20002 after nationalisation. A third locomotive, 20003, was built in 1948. They were later classified as British Rail Class 70

<text>Publius Petronius Turpilianus was a Roman senator who held a number of offices in the middle of the 1st century AD, most notably governor of Britain. He was an ordinary consul in the year 61 with Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus as his colleague.

He was the (adopted?) son of Publius Petronius and Plautia, sister of Aulus Plautius who was the conqueror and first governor of Britain.

== Life ==
He was consul in 61, but in the second half of that year he laid down that office and was appointed governor of Roman Britain, replacing Gaius Suetonius Paulinus who had been removed from office in the wake of the rebellion of Boudica. In contrast to Suetonius&#x27;s punitive measures, Petronius took a conciliatory approach, and conducted few military operations. In 63 he was replaced by Marcus Trebellius Maximus, and was appointed &quot;curator aquarum&quot; (superintendent of aqueducts) in Rome.

In 65 he was given a triumph, apparently for his loyalty to the emperor Nero. Following Nero&#x27;s death in 68, Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was named Emperor by the Senate. During his march from Spain to Rome, Galba had Petronius summarily executed (or ordered him to take his own life) as a commander appointed by Nero.

<doc id="1169557" wikidata="Q2762074" url="?curid=1169557" title="Arthur of the Britons">
<text>Arthur of the Britons is a British television show about the historical King Arthur. Produced by the HTV regional franchise, it consisted of two series, released between 1972 and 1973. ITV had already a reputation for entertaining historical TV shows that would display adventure and swordplay, such as &quot;The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1956), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1955), &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; (1956), &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1958) and &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot; (1961). Like Richard Lionheart in the TV shows about Robin Hood and Ivanhoe this King Arthur shows greatness by making peace between the two foremost peoples in the England of his era. The looks of King Arthur and his brother-in-arms Kai resemble contemporary rockstars. &quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot; was broadcast repeatedly on numerous local ITV stations during the 1970s and 1980s.

The theme music was by Elmer Bernstein.

==Plot==
Set in the Dark Ages a century after the Roman withdrawal from Britain and during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, Arthur is not a glamorous king with an elaborate court; instead, he is (as presumed by some historians) just a Celtic leader who installs and maintains a Celtic alliance against the Saxon invaders. He is instructed by his adoptive father Llud and assisted by Kai, a Saxon orphan reared as Arthur&#x27;s brother. His greatest rival is his cousin, Mark of Cornwall. The Jute chief Yorath and his daughter Rowena are in the beginning allies against the Saxons but finally use their special position to mediate peace negotiations between the Celts and the Saxons. Cerdig, chieftain of the Saxons, is Arthur&#x27;s principal counterpart who in the episode &quot;The Treaty&quot; even insults him as a man &quot;with many brothers but no father&quot; but learns to respect him in the end.

The series dispenses with the legendary Round Table and popular figures such as Merlin, Guinevere and Lancelot and attaches no significance to magic or superstition. Neither Arthur nor his fellow celts are at any time clad in shining armour. Arthur is once again portrayed as a skilled fighter but especially as a cunning politician who eventually comes to good terms with the Saxons. After he has created the basics for a peaceful coexistence between his folk and the Saxons, he falls in love with a Roman princess (last episode, &quot;The Girl From Rome&quot;) called Benedicta (portrayed by Catherine Schell) who wants to live with him in Rome. But Arthur refuses to leave the land and people he loves, and she leaves along with her escort, though it is hinted that she may return.

==Depiction of various elements==

===A Celtic King Arthur===
While some films about him avoid the question of his origin and show him as a man who defends Christian Britain against heathen barbarians out of a sense of integrity, this TV show portrays him as one of the Britons who were already in Great Britain before the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and Normans came, and hence, a Celt defending his homeland.

===Depiction of Celts===
The Celts are portrayed as a self-sufficient people who make their living through cattle breeding and hunting. They are very capable equestrians, who can kill wild boar from horseback. Besides that, they inhabit villages that are fortified with palisades. (In &quot;The Pupil&quot; and &quot;Daughter of the King&quot; the outside of Arthur&#x27;s Celtic village is shown.) That is how they are defined as Celts.

===Depiction of Saxons===
The Saxons are portrayed as farmers who clear the land for cultivation of grain. They are also experienced in using wood to build ships. Their villages are in the middle of their fields and they are not fortified, since they can recognise approaching enemies earlier than the Celts who live in glades. (&quot;The Gift of Life&quot; and the flashbacks in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; provide an impression of Saxon villages.) The Saxons are brave footsoldiers but they are defeated by even a smaller number of Celts if they fight as cavalrymen. (As demonstrated in &quot;The Duel&quot;.) So instead of invading Britain they just infiltrate it as clans (and that is how Arthur describes it in &quot;The Challenge&quot;), fighting with Celtic clans for places that suffice to make a living as farmers.

===Culture clash between Celts and Saxons===
The Celts and Saxons are defined by their cultures and subsequently their conflict derives from their different ways of life. The Celts feel robbed because the Saxons destroy their hunting grounds (as Kai explains to a Saxon girl in the fifth episode, called &quot;People of the Plough&quot;) and the Saxons react to the hostility of the Celts (as explained in the second episode &quot;The Gift of Life&quot;, where the Saxons bring Kai to trial, accusing him of being a traitor). It is not about Christianity, because on both sides there are Christians as well as adepts of other religions such as Mithraism. (In the first episode, called &quot;Arthur is dead&quot;, the gathered Celtic leaders beseech their gods to help them to tackle a task. Also, in the fourth episode, named &quot;The Penitent Invader&quot;, a Christian Celtic leader asks Arthur to help him with another Christian Celtic chieftain, who unfortunately became an unbearable hypocrite and is eventually dealt with by Llud who uses a remedy that according to him was part of Mithraism.) Neither is it simply a conflict between good and evil because there are also pacifists on either side. (In the aforementioned episode &quot;People of the Plough&quot;, Kai mets a pacifist Saxon and in the eighth episode &quot;Rolf the Preacher&quot;, a whole Celtic village turns to pacifism.)

===Arthur&#x27;s role in the conflict===
Arthur seeks to forge an effective Celtic alliance in spite of religious differences, rivalry and sheer animosity among the leaders. He cannot trust in druids, clairvoyants or fairies because they exist in his world no more than in ours. Instead it is all political realism. Still this Arthur is also noble or at least fair. When Saxon children have lost their way they will be brought back to their families by his Saxon friend Kai, when the Saxon lose their cattle because of a disease he will offer him a part of his livestock (episode &quot;In Common Cause&quot;) and when one of his allies takes Saxons as slaves (&quot;Some Saxon Women&quot;) he will talk him out of it. While defending the borders of the remaining Celtic area he prepares from a position of strength a peaceful coexistence. The TV series is composed accordingly, alternating episodes about sustaining the alliance with episodes that show Celtic-Saxon harmonisation. Once Arthur has accomplished his political goals and provided the grounds for peace, he indulges himself to the pursuit of personal happiness.

===An atypically hopeful ending===
Many iterations of Arthurian legend end with Arthur&#x27;s death or severe wounding by Mordred&#x27;s hand at the Battle of Camlann. In &quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot; however, Arthur does not die, nor does he have to be taken to Avalon for healing. In the penultimate episode, under threat of attack by the Scots, Arthur comes close to securing a treaty between himself, Cerdig and Yorath the Jute, but a carelessly placed target board results in a death, and old hostilities quickly re-surface. Arthur and his men return home, disappointed but still hopeful that one day, there will be a lasting peace.

==Feature film and home media==
In 1975, the series was edited into a 90-minute feature film, &quot;King Arthur, the Young Warlord&quot;. The complete series was released on DVD in 2008, by Network. While the movie is available in the US and the UK, the series is only available in the UK.

==Syndication outside UK==
&quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot; was aired in Brazil as &quot;Rei Artur&quot; (King Arthur), simultaneously to its original release in the UK. In France, it was &quot;Le Roi des Celtes&quot; (King of Celts), and in Germany, &quot;König Arthur&quot;. It was never aired in the United States.

<doc id="1169563" wikidata="Q1543282" url="?curid=1169563" title="Granulosa cell">
<text>A granulosa cell or follicular cell is a somatic cell of the sex cord that is closely associated with the developing female gamete (called an oocyte or egg) in the ovary of mammals.

==Structure and function==
In the primordial ovarian follicle, and later in follicle development (folliculogenesis), granulosa cells advance to form a multilayered cumulus oophorus surrounding the oocyte in the preovulatory or antral (or Graafian) follicle.

The major functions of granulosa cells include the production of sex steroids, as well as myriad growth factors thought to interact with the oocyte during its development. The sex steroid production begins with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary, stimulating granulosa cells to convert androgens (coming from the thecal cells) to estradiol by aromatase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after ovulation the granulosa cells turn into granulosa lutein cells that produce progesterone. The progesterone may maintain a potential pregnancy and causes production of a thick cervical mucus that inhibits sperm entry into the uterus.

== Embryology of ovarian granulosa cells ==

In the development of the urinary and reproductive organs, the oogonia become invaginated in the gonadal ridge.

The embryological origin of granulosa cells remains controversial. In the 1970s, evidence emerged that the first cells to make contact with the oogonia were of mesonephric origin. It was suggested that mesonephric cells already closely associated with the oogonia proliferated throughout development to form the granulosa cell layer. Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged with some thorough histology. Sawyer et al. hypothesized that in sheep most of the granulosa cells develop from cells of the mesothelium (i.e., epithelial cells from the presumptive surface epithelium of the ovary). In 2013, it was proposed that both granulosa cells and the ovarian surface epithelial cells are instead derived from a precursor cell called gonadal-ridge epithelial-like cell.
==Cumulus cells (CC) vs mural granulosa cells (MGC)==
Cumulus cells (CC) surround the oocyte. They provide nutrients to the oocyte and influence the development of the oocyte in a paracrine fashion. Mural granulosa cells (MGC) line the follicular wall and surround the fluid-filled antrum. The oocyte secretes factors that determine the functional differences between CCs and MGCs. CCs primarily support growth and development of the oocyte whereas MGCs primarily serve an endocrine function and support the growth of the follicle. Cumulus cells aid in oocyte development and show higher expression of SLC38A3, a transporter for amino acids, and Aldoa, Eno1, Ldh1, Pfkp, Pkm2, and Tpi1, enzymes responsible for glycolysis. MGCs are more steroidogenically active and have higher levels of mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes such as cytochrome P450. MGCs produce an increasing amount of estrogen which leads to the LH surge. Following the LH surge, cumulus cells undergo cumulus expansion, in which they proliferate at a ten-fold higher rate than MGCs in response to FSH. During expansion CCs also produce a mucified matrix required for ovulation.

==Cell culture==
Cell culture of granulosa cells can be performed &quot;in vitro&quot;. Plating density (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for the differentiation. A lower plating density makes granulosa cells exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as progesterone producing theca lutein cells.

==Ovarian aging==

In the female rhesus monkey, DNA double-strand breaks increase in granulosa cells with age, and the ability to repair such DNA breaks declines with age. These changes at the DNA level in granulosa cells may contribute to ovarian aging.

<text>The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) produced several classes of locomotive, mostly to the designs of Nigel Gresley, characterised by a three-cylinder layout with a parallel boiler and round-topped firebox. It produced the most famous locomotive of its day, 4468 &#x27;Mallard&#x27;, the holder of the world steam locomotive speed record. It also built the world-famous 4472 &#x27;Flying Scotsman&#x27;. However, its locomotive inheritance was much greater than just the &#x27;A4 Class&#x27;, it also produced highly successful mixed-traffic and freight designs.

* For an explanation of the classification and numbering systems used by the LNER and its constituent companies, see: LNER locomotive numbering and classification.

==Locomotives of constituent companies==

===Great Central Railway===
Including the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway

====Richard Peacock (1846–1854)====

====W. G. Craig (1854–1859)====

====Charles Sacré (1859–1886)====
====Thomas Parker (1886–1893)====
====Harry Pollitt (1893–1900)====
====John G. Robinson (1900–22)====
see John G. Robinson
There were also 3 steam rail cars built in 1904–1905. These were withdrawn in 1914.

====Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway====
The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway was absorbed by the Great Central Railway on 1 January 1907. All LD&amp;ECR locomotives were built by Kitson &amp; Co.
===Great Eastern Railway===
===Great North of Scotland Railway===

In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway passed on a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains, to the LNER.

===Great Northern Railway===
===Hull and Barnsley Railway===

From its formal establishment in 1885 to the time that it was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1922, the CME of the H&amp;BR was Matthew Stirling, who, like his father and uncle, built locomotives with domeless boilers.
===Metropolitan Railway===
Three classes (the G, H and K Classes) were taken into LNER stock on 1 November 1937. The other former Metropolitan locomotives were retained by London Transport, which had acquired all of them at its formation on 1 July 1933.

===Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway===
M&amp;GN locomotives were taken into LNER stock on 1 October 1936.

===North British Railway===
===North Eastern Railway===
==Locomotives built by the LNER==

===Gresley designs===
===Thompson designs===
===Peppercorn designs===

Another A1, &quot;Tornado&quot; has been built by subscription among LNER (and other) locomotive enthusiasts, and came into service in 2008. In total it cost £3 million. Again under the chairmanship of Mark Allatt, the team is (2014) now raising funds most successfully to build another Gresley P2 2-8-2 of the &quot;Cock O&#x27;the North&quot; Class, to be called &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Both new steam locomotives are the product of a restored railway works in Darlington.

===Other designs ===
* LNER Class A1 – continuation of a GNR design. Several built under the GNR entered service under the LNER.
* LNER Class A2 – based on an NER design simply designated as 4.6.2
* LNER Class A5 – Continuation of a GCR design
* LNER Class A8 – rebuilt from H1 between 1931 and 1936
* LNER Class B12/3 – based on an existing GER design
* LNER Class B16 – continuation of an NER design
* LNER Class C9 – C7 rebuild
* LNER Class D16 – based on an existing GER design. Built by the GER but delivered after grouping.
* LNER Class J27 – continuation of an NER design
* LNER Class J45/DES1 English Electric diesel electric shunting locomotive
* LNER Class DES2 Brush diesel electric shunting locomotive
* LNER Class J50 – continuation of a GNR design. Thirty were rebuilds of Class J51.
* LNER Class J72 – NER Class E1
* LNER Class J94 – WD Austerity 0-6-0ST
* LNER Class N2 – continuation of a GNR design
* LNER Class N7 – continuation of a GER design
* LNER Class N15 – continuation of an NBR design
* LNER Class O2 - continuation of a GNR design.

* LNER Class O7 – WD Austerity 2-8-0 – 350 loaned to the LNER 1943–47; 200 purchased 1946; 270 loaned to the LNER 1947
* USATC S160 Class – 168 loaned to the LNER 1942–1945
* WD Austerity 2-10-0 – 13 loaned to the LNER 1943–44; 20 loaned 1945–46
* LNER Class S1 – Continuation of a GCR design
* LNER Class T1 – NER Class X
* LNER Class Y1 – Sentinel shunter
* LNER Class Y3 – Sentinel shunter
* LNER Class Y7 – NER Class H
* LNER Class Y10 – Sentinel shunter
* LNER Class Y11 – Simplex 0-4-0 petrol locomotive &quot;(later British Rail 15097–15099)&quot;

==Post-Nationalisation==
British Railways continued to build LNER designs (the B1 and L1 classes in particular) immediately after Nationalisation. Remarkably, it even built a new series of shunting locomotives (J72 class) to a pre-Grouping design (of the North Eastern Railway). However, it was to be the Eastern Region that took the first of BR&#x27;s new Standard locomotives, 70000 &#x27;Britannia&#x27;, for its Great Eastern Main Line workings to Norwich in 1951.

BR built 396 locomotives to ex-LNER designs. One of these, the J72 Class was a North Eastern Railway design dating from 1898.

==Withdrawal==
Withdrawal of ex-LNER locomotives took place throughout the 1960s, with some of the once high-profile &#x27;A4 Class&#x27; locomotives ending their lives on heavy freight trains in Scotland; a far cry from the glamorous express workings of the late 1930s.

==Preservation==
Several of the many LNER locomotives have been preserved. (Numbers given are those currently carried: many locomotives have carried a range of numbers during their active and preserved careers).
† denotes name given only in preservation.

<doc id="1169577" wikidata="Q259964" url="?curid=1169577" title="Ona Munson">
<text>Ona Munson (born Owena Elizabeth Wolcott; June 16, 1903 – February 11, 1955) was an American film and stage actress. She starred in nine Broadway productions and 20 feature films in her career, which spanned over 30 years.

Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, Munson began her stage career in New York theater in 1919, debuting on Broadway in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;. She starred in another four Broadway plays and musicals before the end of the 1920s. In 1930, she moved to Los Angeles to embark on a career in film, but after appearing as leads in several films, such as &quot;Going Wild&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Hot Heiress&quot; (1931), she returned to Broadway, starring in several productions, including Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1935).

Munson resumed her film career in the late 1930s, and was cast as madam Belle Watling in David O. Selznick&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), a role which became her most famous. She starred in numerous films for Warner Bros. in the 1940s, but was often typecast based on her performance in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, for instance in von Sternberg’s &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; (1941).

Munson married painter Eugene Berman in 1950, her second husband after a five-year marriage to director Edward Buzzell. She also had several documented affairs with women, including Alla Nazimova and playwright Mercedes de Acosta. Some commentators have considered her marriages as &quot;lavender marriages&quot;, concealing Munson&#x27;s homosexuality. By the mid-1950s, Munson was suffering from health complications following an unspecified surgical procedure, and frequently was using barbiturates. In February 1955, Berman found Munson dead in their Manhattan apartment, having committed suicide via a barbiturate overdose.

==Life and career==
===1903–1918: Early life===
Munson was born Owena Elizabeth Wolcott on June 16, 1903 in Portland, Oregon, the last of four children born to Owen Wolcott and Sally Wolcott (née Gore). All three of her elder siblings had died in infancy, leaving Munson the first surviving and only child. Munson was of French-Canadian heritage; her paternal grandmother immigrated from Quebec in 1865.

Munson was raised in Portland, where she attended the Catlin Gabel School (then known as Miss Catlin&#x27;s School), and developed an affinity for English literature. Her parents divorced in the 1920s, and her father later remarried.

===1919–1929: Broadway career===
She first appeared on Broadway in a minor role in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, followed by a supporting part in &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle&quot; (both staged in 1919). In 1926, Munson took over the title role of the singing and dancing ingenue Nanette in the original production of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. On July 16, 1926, she married her first husband, fellow stage actor Edward Buzzell. The following year, she portrayed the title character in &quot;Manhattan Mary&quot;, followed by the female lead in 1928&#x27;s original production of &quot;Hold Everything!&quot;, a musical in which she introduced the song &quot;You&#x27;re the Cream in My Coffee&quot;.

===1930–1940: Move to Hollywood===

Munson moved to Los Angeles in 1930, and appeared in the Warner Bros. movie &quot;Going Wild&quot;. Originally, this film was intended as a musical, but all the numbers were removed before release owing to the public&#x27;s distaste for musicals, which virtually saturated the cinema in 1929–30. The following year, she divorced Buzzell. After the divorce, Munson had a brief affair with filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch before his marriage to Vivian Gaye.

Munson appeared the next year in &quot;The Hot Heiress&quot;, in which she sings several songs along with her co-star Ben Lyon. She also starred in &quot;Broadminded&quot; (1931) and &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1931). After completing these films, Munson returned to New York and resumed her theater career, starring in Broadway productions of &quot;Hold Your Horses&quot; (1933), followed by &quot;Petticoat Fever&quot; and Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; (both staged in 1935), in the latter of which she portrayed Regina Engstrand. During rehearsals for &quot;Ghosts&quot;, Munson had a short-lived romantic affair with actress Alla Nazimova, which ended before the play&#x27;s premiere. Co-star Harry Ellerbe stated that the couple had &quot;parted amicably.&quot;

====&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;====

Munson returned to Los Angeles in 1938 to appear a minor part in &quot;His Exciting Night&quot;, followed by an uncredited role in &quot;Dramatic School&quot;. When David O. Selznick began casting his production &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, he first announced that Mae West was to play Belle, but both West and Tallulah Bankhead refused the role as too small. Munson was the antithesis of the voluptuous Belle: freckled and of slight build—but Selznick cast her in the role.

Munson had no apprehensions in accepting the role, as she said was the case of many an actress confronted with an objectionable character. Upon learning she had the role, &quot;I was delighted. So many wanted it, I had no idea the directors would give it to me.&quot;

&quot;The most difficult part of [the] role is acting between the lines. &#x27;Belle&#x27; had so many things to say that could not be said, it was necessary to enact them. That took patience and hard work. I hope I have been able to do what they would not let me say.&quot;

Munson’s career was stalemated by the acclaim of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;; for the remainder of her career, she was typecast in similar roles. In 1940, Munson had an affair with playwright Mercedes de Acosta while working for Republic Pictures in Los Angeles. Their affair was intense, with Munson once writing to Acosta in a letter: &quot;I long to hold you in my arms and pour my love into you.&quot;

===1941–1955: Later years===

She subsequently appeared as Chinese casino owner of dubious repute, Mother Gin Sling, in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s film &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; (1941), in which she was &quot;unrecognizable&quot;, presumably due to the ‘yellowface’ make-up created for her character and others for the film. During production, it was publicized that Munson had planned to marry Federal Housing agent Stewart McDonald. Though the couple ultimately did not marry, they remained romantically involved through 1942. Her last film was &quot;The Red House&quot;, released in 1947.

Munson&#x27;s work on radio included co-starring (as Lorelei) with Edward G. Robinson on &quot;Big Town&quot;.

Munson married painter Eugene Berman on January 20, 1950 in Beverly Hills.

==Death==
Plagued by ill health stemming from an unnamed surgical procedure, Munson committed suicide at the age of 51 with an overdose of barbiturates in her apartment in The Belnord on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Her body was discovered by her husband Berman on the afternoon of February 11, 1955. A note found next to her bed read: &quot;This is the only way I know to be free again... Please don&#x27;t follow me.&quot; An autopsy determined that Munson had ingested the barbiturates between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on February 11.

She was interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Munson posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located on the north side of the 6200 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

== Posthumous speculations ==
Historians Billy Harbin and Kim Marra have termed Munson&#x27;s marriages as &quot;lavender marriages&quot; intended to conceal her bisexuality and affairs with women.

Munson has been listed as a member of a group termed the &quot;sewing circle&quot;, a clique of lesbians organized by actress Alla Nazimova, who was one of Munson&#x27;s lovers.

<doc id="1169582" wikidata="Q1472272" url="?curid=1169582" title="Sunbeam Alpine">
<text>The Sunbeam Alpine is a two-seater sports roadster/drophead coupé that was produced by the Rootes Group from 1953 to 1955, and then 1959 to 1968. The name was then used on a two-door fastback coupé from 1969 to 1975. The original Alpine was launched in 1953 as the first vehicle from Sunbeam-Talbot to bear the Sunbeam name alone since Rootes Group bought Clément-Talbot, and later the moribund Sunbeam from its receiver in 1935.

==Alpine Mark I and III==
The Alpine was derived from the Sunbeam-Talbot 90 Saloon, and has become colloquially known as the &quot;Talbot&quot; Alpine. It was a two-seater sports roadster initially developed for a one-off rally car by Bournemouth Sunbeam-Talbot dealer George Hartwell. It had its beginnings as a 1952 Sunbeam-Talbot drophead coupé. Announced in March 1953 it received its name following Sunbeam-Talbot saloons successes in the Alpine Rally during the early 1950s. On its first competitive outing, the July 1953 Coupe des Alpes, the new car won the Coupe des Dames (Sheila van Damm) and, without loss of any marks, four Coupes des Alpes driven by Stirling Moss, John Fitch, G Murray-Frame and Sheila van Damm.

The car has a four-cylinder engine from the saloon, but with a raised compression ratio. However, since it was developed from the saloon platform, it suffered from rigidity compromises despite extra side members in the chassis. The gearbox ratios were changed, and from 1954 an overdrive unit became standard. The gear-change lever was column-mounted. A true open 2-seater, there were no external door handles or wind-up windows.

The Alpine Mark I and Mark III (no Mark II was made) were hand-built at Mulliners of Birmingham coachbuilders, from 1953 to 1955, and remained in production for only two years. Of the 1582 automobiles produced, 961 were exported to the US and Canada, 445 stayed in the UK, and 175 went to other world markets. In 2000 it was estimated that perhaps as few as 200 had survived.

The Sunbeam Alpine Mk 1 Special was based on the 2267 cc Mk 1 Sunbeam Talbot motor, with alloy rocker cover and Siamese exhaust ports (cylinders 2 and 3). These motors developed a reputed 97.5 bhp at 4,500 rpm, mainly by raising the compression ratio to 8.0:1 and incorporating a special induction manifold with a twin choke Solex 40 P.I.I carburettor. The motors of the Sunbeam Alpine Team Cars (MKV 21–26) were configured the same as the Sunbeam Alpine Mk I Special, with further tuning by ERA to raise power to 106 bhp.

Very few of these cars are ever seen on the big screen. However, a sapphire blue Alpine featured prominently in the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. More recently, the American PBS show &quot;History Detectives&quot; tried to verify that an Alpine roadster owned by a private individual was the actual car used in that movie. Although the Technicolor process could &quot;hide&quot; the car&#x27;s true colour, and knowing that the car was shipped back from Monaco to the US for use in front of a rear projection effect, the car shown on the programme was ultimately proven not to be the film car upon comparison of the vehicle identification numbers. A Mk I model also appears in the 1957 British horror film &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;. A reference to the Mark I is also made in Muriel Spark&#x27;s 1957 debut novel, &quot;The Comforters&quot;, where the supercharged Sunbeam Alpine prompts a race with the protagonists&#x27; MG.

==Alpine Series I to V==
The first open 2-seater Alpines were based on the Hillman 14 and its successor the Humber Hawk. Rootes replaced them with a softer new smaller 2-seater sports convertible coupé based on the current Hillman Minx and its variants. Kenneth Howes and Jeff Crompton were tasked with doing a complete redesign in 1956, with the goal of producing a dedicated sports car aimed principally at the US market. Howes did some 80 per cent of the overall design. He had been on the Studebaker team at Loewy Studios and then at Ford in Detroit before joining Rootes.

The Alpine was produced in four subsequent revisions until 1968. Total production numbered around 70,000. Production stopped shortly after the Chrysler takeover of the Rootes Group.

===Series I (1959–1960)===
The &quot;Series&quot; Alpine started production in 1959.

The Series I was built on a modified floorpan from the Hillman Husky estate car with a engine and made extensive use of components from other Rootes Group vehicles. The running gear came mainly from the Sunbeam Rapier, but with front disc brakes replacing the saloon car&#x27;s drums. An overdrive unit and wire wheels were optional. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs and at the rear had a live axle and semi-elliptic springing. The Girling-manufactured brakes used discs at the front and drums at the rear. It had dual downdraft carburetors, a soft top that could be hidden by special integral covers and the first available wind-up side windows offered in a British sports car of that time.

Coupé versions of the post-1959 version were built by Thomas Harrington Ltd. After the Le Mans Index of Efficiency success of 1961, Harrington sold replicas as the &quot;Harrington Le Mans&quot;, using a fastback body and an engine tuned to . Unlike the Le Mans racers, these cars had a more integrated rear roofline and were without the tail fins of the roadsters. Until 1962 the car was assembled for Rootes by Armstrong Siddeley.

An open car with overdrive was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1959. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 13.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1031 including taxes.

11,904 examples of the series I were produced. One of the original prototypes still survives and was raced by British Touring car champion Bernard Unett.

=== Series II (1960–1963) ===
The Series II of 1960 featured an enlarged engine producing 80 bhp and revised rear suspension, but there were few other changes. When it was replaced in 1963, 19,956 had been made.

A Series II with hardtop and overdrive was tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1960, which recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0– in 13.6 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £1,110 including taxes.

===Series III (1963–1964)===
The Series III was produced in two versions:

* GT with removable hardtop only (no soft-top)
* ST with soft-top (stored behind the small rear seat)

Other distinguishing features were:
* High fins
* Quarter-height window for guide post
* Roll-up window rear edge angular
* Vertical spare tyre
* Tanks in fins
* All chrome bumper guards
* Later &quot;flat&quot; rear window hard top
* Series 3 badge on front wing and Rootes Group badge centered low on the bonnet.
* Serial number begins with B 92___

The rarest production Alpine, the Series III was produced from March, 1963 to January, 1964 for a total of 5,863 units. It was a transitional model, incorporating many of the modifications of the later low fin cars such as roomier boot, later hard top (common with Tiger), tube type rear shocks, improved micro cell seats, and a vacuum brake booster. The 1592 cc engine was de-tuned in the GT for smoothness.

===Series IV (1964–1965)===
There was no longer a lower-output engine option; the convertible and hardtop versions shared the same 82 bhp engine with single Solex carburettor. A new rear styling was introduced with the fins largely removed. Automatic transmission with floor-mounted control became an option, but was unpopular. From autumn 1964 a new manual gearbox with synchromesh on first gear was adopted in line with its use in other Rootes cars. A total of 12,406 were made.

===Series V (1965–1968)===
The final version had a new five-bearing engine with twin Zenith-Stromberg semi-downdraught carburettors producing 93 bhp. There was no longer an automatic transmission option. 19,122 were made. In some export markets, SAE were claimed.
A muscle-car variant of the later versions was also built, the Sunbeam Tiger.
===Competition===

The Alpine enjoyed relative success in European and North American competition. Probably the most notable international success was at Le Mans, where a Sunbeam Harrington won the Thermal Index of Efficiency in 1961. In the United States the Alpine competed successfully in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events.

Vince Tamburo won the G-Production National Championship in 1960 using the 1494 cc Series I Alpine. In 1961 Don Sesslar took 2nd in the F-Production National Championship followed by a 3rd in the Championship in 1962. For 1963 the Alpine was moved into E-Production facing stiff competition from a class dominated by the Porsche 356. Sesslar tied in points for the national championship while Norman Lamb won the Southwest Division Championship in his Alpine.

A championship for Don Sesslar finally was achieved in 1964 with 5 wins (the SCCA totaled the 5 top finishes for the year). Dan Carmichael won the Central Division Championship in 1964 and &#x27;65. Carmichael continued to race the Alpine until 1967, when he finished 2nd at the American Road Race of Champions.

Bernard Unett raced factory prototype Alpine (registration number XRW 302) from 1962 to 1964 and in 1964 won the Fredy Dixon challenge trophy, which was considered to be biggest prize on the British club circuit at the time. Unett went on to become British Touring car champion three times during the 1970s.

A six-car works team was set up for the 1953 Alpine Rally. Although outwardly similar to their production-car counterparts they reputedly incorporated some 36 modifications, boosting the engine to an estimated 97.5 bhp.
==Alpine &quot;Fastback&quot;==

Rootes introduced the &quot;Arrow&quot; range in 1966, and by 1968 the saloons and estates (such as the Hillman Hunter) had been joined by a Sunbeam Rapier Fastback coupé model. In 1969, a cheaper, slightly slower and more economical version of the Rapier (still sold as a sporty model) was badged as the new Sunbeam Alpine.

All models featured the group&#x27;s strong five-bearing engine, with the Alpine featuring a single Zenith-Stromberg CD150 carburettor to the Rapier&#x27;s twins, and the Rapier H120&#x27;s twin 40DCOE Weber carburettors.

Although drawing many parts from the group&#x27;s &quot;parts bin&quot;, including the rear lights of the estate Arrow models, the fastbacks nevertheless offered a number of unique features, including their pillar-less doors and rear side windows which combined to open up the car much like a cabriolet with a hardtop fitted. Extensive wooden dashboards were fitted to some models, and sports seats were available for a time.
==Post-Sunbeam Alpine==
The Alpine name was resurrected in 1976 by Chrysler (by then the owner of Rootes), on a totally unrelated vehicle: the UK-market version of the Simca 1307, a French-built family hatchback. The car was initially badged as the Chrysler Alpine, and then finally as the Talbot Alpine following Chrysler Europe&#x27;s takeover by Peugeot in 1978. The name survived until 1984, although the design survived (with different names) until 1986.

==Notable film and television appearances==

* A metallic blue 1953 Sunbeam Alpine Mk I is driven by Grace Kelly in &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955) with Cary Grant.
* A Sunbeam Alpine Mk III is driven by Peggy Cummins in the film &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (1957).
* A red Series I Alpine is driven by Elizabeth Taylor in the film &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; (1960) and features in a number of scenes.
* A white Series 1 Alpine was the regular drive of Rod Taylor&#x27;s character Glenn Evans, a crime fighting news reporter, in the early 1960s TV series, &quot;Hong Kong&quot;.
* A lake blue &quot;Series II&quot; Alpine roadster is amongst the first on-screen &quot;Bond cars&quot; when it is rented and driven by James Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot; of 1962, most notably in a scene where Bond drives it under a crane to escape from pursuing hit men. It was reportedly borrowed from a local resident, as the only suitable sports car available on the island used for filming. In the novel, a Sunbeam Alpine was the chosen car of assassinated Secret Service agent John Strangways.
*Michael Caine&#x27;s character is rescued by a woman in a white 1968 Alpine roadster in the 1971 British crime film &quot;Get Carter&quot;. The car is later shunted into a dock with the owner locked in the boot.
* A Sunbeam Tiger (the V8 version of the Alpine) was also the vehicle of choice for spy Maxwell Smart in the 1960s TV comedy series &quot;Get Smart&quot;. An Alpine, outfitted to look like the Tiger, was used for the &quot;gadget&quot; shots, such as the cannon that comes up through the bonnet. The Alpine was used because the cannon would not fit under the bonnet of a V-8 car. The car was modified by noted American customizer Gene Winfield and was the subject of a 1/25th scale plastic model kit.
* A similar Alpine is seen in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;Commando&quot;, where it was destroyed.
* A Sunbeam Alpine is driven by Michael Caine in the 1966 film &quot;Gambit&quot;. The film also starred Shirley MacLaine and Herbert Lom.
* A powder blue 1967 Sunbeam Alpine is driven by Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins in the 1968 film &quot;Pretty Poison&quot;.
* In the TV series &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, the character of Jackie Bradley, portrayed by Fiona Dolman, drives a green hardtop Series V Sunbeam Alpine, with red interior, bearing the original registration plate LVY 666F (1967), in series 9–10. This was actually a white (fully restored) car originally but it was sprayed green to appear in the show to prevent glare. In Series 11, episode 12, &quot;Closing the Book&quot; two characters arrive at Scripps’ Garage in a gold, hardtop Sunbeam Alpine, bearing the registration plate 836 FXH.
* In the 1966 Launder &amp; Gilliat film &quot;The Great St. Trinian&#x27;s Train Robbery&quot;, Flash Harry (George Cole), possesses a crimson Sunbeam Alpine which he refers to as his &#x27;status symbol&#x27;. He and some sixth-formers use the car to chase after the train robbers (led by Frankie Howerd).
* A light blue 1963 Sunbeam Alpine Series III is driven by Nancy Drew in the 2019 TV series of the same name.

<text>USS &quot;Julia was a [[schooner]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Initially the privately-owned schooner Julia, she was captured at the onset of the war by armed boats looking for violators of President [[James Madison]]&#x27;s embargo of trade with the British. Purchased by the United States Navy, the vessel was armed with two guns and made part of the [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. &quot;Julia&quot; took part in the [[Battle of York]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]]. In August 1813, the schooner was captured by the [[Royal Navy]] after failing to execute a turn and was put in service asHMS &quot;Confiance. The vessel continued as a warship in British service for a couple of weeks before being converted to a troop transport. In October, &quot;Confiance&quot; was recaptured by the Americans and renamed &quot;Julia&quot;. No longer considered capable as a warship, the vessel was retired from service.

==Description and early career==
&quot;Julia&quot; was a schooner constructed at Oswego, New York and launched in 1811 for trade on the Great Lakes. Measuring 53 tons burthen, &quot;Julia&quot; was taken as a prize in June 1812 on the upper Saint Lawrence River by armed boats of the United States Navy for having violated President James Madison embargo of trade with the British. The master of &quot;Julia&quot; had failed to gain the proper certification showing that the schooner had cleared its last American port.

==War of 1812==
In September 1812, Lieutenant Melancthon T. Woolsey purchased &quot;Julia&quot; for the Navy on Lake Ontario for $3,800. The ship was fitted with two guns, a long gun on a pivot and a gun and the ship had a complement of 40. &quot;Julia&quot; sailed from Sackets Harbor on 8 November 1812 with Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s flotilla. That afternoon lookouts on the American ships spotted , flagship of the Provincial Marine, off False Ducks Island and sent her fleeing into the Bay of Quinte where she escaped due to nightfall. The next morning they again sighted her and resumed the chase. When the British ship reached the shelter of the shore batteries at Kingston, Upper Canada, Chauncey decided to follow her in to test the strength of the defenses and, if possible, to capture the warship. Led by and &quot;Julia&quot;, Chauncey&#x27;s vessels, stood toward the harbor entrance despite the fire from on shore and &quot;Royal George&quot;.

Approaching nightfall and threatening weather forced Chauncey to retreat to Wolfe Island where he anchored hoping to resume the action the next day. However, poor weather on the morning of 10 November ruled out a renewal of the attack and forced the Americans to return to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. As the flotilla retired, the British merchant ship was spotted and the Americans gave chase. Although fire from &quot;Julia&quot;, , and damaged &quot;Governor Simcoe&quot; considerably, the merchant ship managed to escape. The American flotilla returned to Sackets Harbor on 12 November before departing again on 13 November. They chased , another Provincial Marine ship as it neared Kingston. They failed to catch up with the ship and &quot;Earl of Moira&quot; got away. The flotilla returned to Sackets Harbor. The American fleet was laid up for the winter months on the Great Lakes.

With the return of good weather, Chauncey&#x27;s ships sortied from Sackets Harbor on 23 April 1813 in cooperation with 1,700 soldiers of the United States Army under General Henry Dearborn, but were forced to return due to gale. On 25 April 1813, they departed for a raid on York (now Toronto), Upper Canada. Two days later, after landing the troops, &quot;Julia&quot; and her fellow ships supported them with grapeshot enabling them to repulse counterattacks by Indians and British troops while successfully taking York. The American loot included large amounts of naval and military stores and the British brig . Moreover, the 24-gun nearing completion was burned at York.

On 8 May, the squadron departed York to transport troops and provisions of General Dearborn&#x27;s army for the campaign on the Niagara Peninsula. On 27 May, &quot;Julia&quot; and led the flotilla into the Niagara River to open an attack on Fort George by shelling a British battery dug in near the lighthouse. The other American ships took pre-assigned positions where they shelled targets ashore. Meanwhile, Captain Oliver Hazard Perry directed the disembarkation of troops. In three hours, the carefully coordinated attack drove the defenders from the field.

With the fall of Fort George, the British retreated from the Niagara region. As the Americans were attacking the Niagara region, the British assaulted Chauncey&#x27;s base at Sackets Harbor on 27 May. The port&#x27;s defenses were significantly damaged before Chauncey&#x27;s flotilla could return and affected Chauncey&#x27;s willingness to leave his base unprotected. In July, the American and British squadrons sailed onto Lake Ontario. On 7 August, the American squadron encountered the British squadron, but no battle occurred.

==Capture, British service and fate==
On the night of 7–8 August, &quot;Julia&quot; rescued a number of survivors of after that schooner had capsized and sunk in a heavy gale off Twelve Mile Creek. During the next three days, the American flotilla and the British squadron maneuvered seeking to move into an advantageous position for a general engagement. On 10 August &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Growler&quot; were cut off from the flotilla after their commanders executed an incorrect turn and were captured. The British renamed the schooners &quot;Confiance&quot; and &quot;Hamilton&quot; respectively and incorporated them into their squadron for several weeks. As they were slow, they were re-purposed as troop transports. Chauncey recaptured them near False Ducks Islands on 5 October when he intercepted a convoy of seven troop transports. However, the schooners, having proven unstable in heavy seas, were soon retired from service.

<text>Marcus Trebellius Maximus was a Roman senator active during the reign of Nero. He was suffect consul for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of May to June 55 AD as the colleague of Seneca the Younger, replacing Publius Cornelius Dolabella.

In 61 Trebellius served on a commission to revise the census list and tax assessments in Gaul, together with Quintus Volusius Saturninus and Titus Sextius Africanus. Saturninus and Africanus were rivals, and both hated Trebellius, who took advantage of their rivalry to get the better of them. In AD 63, he was appointed governor of Britain. He continued the policy of consolidation followed by his immediate predecessor, and conquered no new territory. He continued the Romanisation of Britain, refounding Camulodunum after the rebellion of Boudica destroyed it. Londinium grew in mercantile wealth under his rule.

By 67, the province was secure enough to allow Legio XIV &quot;Gemina&quot; to be withdrawn, but inactivity, and the lack of opportunities for booty, led to mutinies among the legions that remained. Not being a military man, Trebellius was unable to restore discipline, and a feud with Marcus Roscius Coelius, commander of XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot;, further undermined his authority.

In 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, Britain did not forward its own candidate to replace Nero as other regions had done. Instead, Roscius led a mutiny which forced Trebellius to flee, and threw his weight behind Vitellius, sending units from Legio XX to fight for him. Once Vitellius had gained the empire he appointed a new governor, Marcus Vettius Bolanus. Vitellius also returned Legio XIV, which had sided with his defeated opponent Otho, to Britain.

<text>BR Standard Class 9F number 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot; is a preserved British steam locomotive completed in 1960. It was the last steam locomotive to be built by British Railways. It was the only British main line steam locomotive earmarked for preservation from the date of construction. It was the 999th locomotive of the whole British Railways Standard range.

==Construction==
&quot;Evening Star&quot; was built at Swindon Works in 1960. Though the last to be built, it was not the last 9F numerically as Crewe Works had already completed engines with higher numbers. It was equipped with a BR1G-type tender and given BR Locomotive Green livery, normally reserved for passenger locomotives, and was completed with a copper-capped double chimney. All other members of the class of heavy freight locomotives were painted unlined black.

===Naming===
92220 was the only Class 9F to be named when running with BR, although other 9Fs have subsequently been named in preservation.

The name &quot;Evening Star&quot; was chosen following a competition run in 1959-60 by the BR Western Region Staff Magazine. There were three competition winners, Driver T.M. Phillips (Aberystwyth), Boilermaker J.S. Sathi (Old Oak Common) and F.L. Pugh (Paddington), who had all suggested &quot;Evening Star&quot;. 

A special commemorative plate was affixed below the nameplate on the smoke deflectors. The commemorative plate reads:

The wooden patterns for this commemorative plate and the engine&#x27;s name plate were both carved by pattern maker Fred Marsh.

==== Naming ceremony ====

The naming ceremony took place on 18 March 1960 at the Swindon Works, where the locomotive was built. A speech was given by R.F. Hanks, Chairman of the Western Area Board of British Transport Commission:

The loco was then named by Keith Grand of the British Transport Commission, by the unveiling of the nameplate, naming it &quot;Evening Star&quot;.

==In service==

92220 was used over the Western Region and over the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway line. Its main duties were as a heavy freight locomotive. However, 92220 was never just any locomotive, its working was closely controlled &quot;to ensure she returned home regularly for cleaning and maintenance in view of the special workings and exhibitions for which the engine was required&quot;.
On 27–28 June and 1 July 1960, No. 92220, then allocated to Cardiff Canton shed, hauled the BR Western Region&#x27;s flagship Paddington to Cardiff, Swansea, Neyland and Fishguard Harbour passenger express trains, the London bound &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and the return &quot;Capitals United Express&quot; between Cardiff and Paddington, reportedly having to delay its arrival at Paddington to allow for completion of restaurant services because it was running so early; easily outperforming the regular Britannia passenger express locomotives, which it was observed overtaking (while hauling a full rake of 10+ passenger express coaches) on several occasions. However, its career on these flagship services was cut short, by order of BR senior management, allegedly from fear of damage to its running gear which wasn&#x27;t designed for extended high speed express work. BR management&#x27;s embargo, issued after they received word of the runs on 27–28 June, wasn&#x27;t enforced until after driver Eddie Broom, head of Canton Shed&#x27;s Local Departmental Committee (the local branch shop steward of ASLEF, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen&#x27;s extremely powerful trades union), had his turn on 92220&#x27;s down Capitals United Express run, on 1 July 1960.

On 16 July 1962 and 18 July 1962, the locomotive was photographed at Gloucester Barnwood shed yard, and on 8 September 1962 it hauled the last &quot;Pines Express&quot; on the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway. Evening Star was recorded hauling passenger express trains at over on its &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Capitals United Express&quot; runs. 92220 was withdrawn in 1965 and stored at Severn Tunnel Junction Marshalling Yard, after incurring minor damage in a shunting accident at Cardiff Docks. It had a working life of just five years and one day which was the shortest operational life of all 251 class members. It was subsequently preserved as part of the National Collection. In late 1966, the locomotive, by then in decrepit condition, was towed to Crewe Works via Shrewsbury for overhaul and restoration.

==Preservation==

&quot;Evening Star&quot; remained in operation into the 1980s and is one of nine surviving 9Fs. From July 1973 it operated on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, moving to the National Railway Museum, York in May 1975. In 1986 it was loaned to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and in 1989 to the West Somerset Railway. Since withdrawal, it has been a static exhibit at the National Railway Museum.

After a brief period displayed at the National Railway Museum Shildon, the engine returned to its birthplace, Swindon Works, on 3 September 2008. &quot;Evening Star&quot; remained on display for two years at the Swindon Steam Railway Museum to celebrate its 50th anniversary. It returned to the National Railway Museum in 2010, whilst the GWR locomotive No. 4003 &quot;Lode Star&quot; took its place at Swindon.

<text>AS Kalev (2006– Kalev Chocolate Factory AS) is an Estonian confectionery company. The company traces its origins back two hundred years, the business that preceded the Maiasmokk café was founded in 1806, and is now owned by Kalev. The Kalev company is the country&#x27;s largest producer of sweets and a part of the industrial conglomerate Orkla Group. Kalev is based in Põrguvälja near Jüri, Rae Parish, Harju County.

==History==

=== Roots and foundational developments (19th century) ===
The birth of the Estonian confectionery industry dates back to 1806, when pastry cook Lorenz Caviezel (:de) opened a confectionery business in Tallinn at Pikk Street, where Café Maiasmokk (Sweet Tooth) has been located since 1864.

In 1864, the business, which had changed hands many times, came into the possession of Georg Johann Stude. After ten years of operation, Stude decided to expand the business: he bought a neighbouring house and in place of these two houses constructed a new and more solid building, which is still there. Out of Stude&#x27;s production, marzipan figures and hand-made chocolate candies were in especially high demand. Stude&#x27;s sweets sequentially became known outside Estonia. Thus, for example, the court of the Russian tsar was a regular customer at the turn of the 20th century.

Recipes and working methods originating from Stude&#x27;s confectionery are still held in great esteem in today&#x27;s Kalev – to this day the marzipan figures are hand-made candies.

=== Predecessors and birth of an industry (Early 20th century) ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were other pioneers of the confectionery industry in Tallinn that could be considered the predecessors of Kalev. Perhaps one of the most renowned was Kawe confectionery, founded in 1921 by brothers Karl and Kolla Wellner at Müürivahe Street, 62. Kawe&#x27;s products, the then greatest confectionery in Estonia, were well known in Estonia and abroad, and the company exported a significant share of its output to destinations such as the United States, England, Tunisia, Morocco, France, India and China.

Of other big sweet producers of the time, the factories of Ginovker, Brandmann and Klausson should also be mentioned. At the end of the 1930s, Kawe and these three confectioneries employed 75% of all Estonian confectionery workers. Competing with big factories were a number of smaller enterprises: Riola, Endla, Eelis, Efekt and others.

=== Mergers and Kave branding (Soviet era) ===
The change in policy in 1940 brought along big changes for the confectionery industry. This was the time of nationalisation and company mergers. In 1940, the Riola factory was joined with the Brandmann business and the enterprise was renamed the Karamell Sweet Factory. Later on, Karamell was joined by the marzipan and chocolate candy unit of Georg Stude&#x27;s business. Cakes and tarts continued to be made at the Pikk Street building, still known as the Café Maiasmokk.

Soon after that, Kawe merged with the sweet factories of Efekt, Eelis, Endla, Soliid and the Ermos syrup factory situated in Kloodi manor house near Rakvere. The merged enterprise continued to operate under the name Kawe until 1948. On 1 April 1948, the company was renamed Kalev Confectionery Factory. The name was changed for ideological reasons: someone had complained to a minister that the name “Kawe” had once been formed of the former owners’ initials. This, however, was perceived as inappropriate for a Soviet enterprise. Hence, a name competition was quickly held. There were two name propositions: “Punane Kompu” (Red Candy) and “Kalev”. A majority of only one vote determined that the new name would be “Kalev”.

In 1957, a new confectionery operation named Uus Kalev (New Kalev) was opened at Pärnu Road 139, which merged with Karamell a year later. In 1962, New Kalev and Kalev merged into what is now operating as the Kalev confectionery factory.

Throughout the Soviet period, Kalev produced sweets at full capacity for Estonia, as well as almost the whole of the former Soviet Union. Kalev&#x27;s sweets also found recognition outside the borders of the Soviet Union, bringing home prizes from several international fairs and exhibitions. Kalev is also known to have produced the first Soviet chewing gum in 1968. Although, it was directly banned for propagandizing the capitalist way of life. Eventually the production was restarted in 1979 and even though other factories opened in other parts of Soviet Union Kalev captured more than half of the Soviet market.

=== State enterprise and privatization (Post-Soviet era and recent developments) ===
In 1991, the state enterprise of Kalev was founded on the basis of the Kalev confectionery factory. In 1995, the privatisation of the state enterprise became possible and a public limited company was founded.

From 1996 to 2009, the shares of the public limited company AS Kalev were listed on the Tallinn Stock Exchange. The owner of the majority of shares, Oliver Kruuda took the company private. The year 2003 was historically important to Kalev: the company moved from Tallinn to a new factory complex in Harjumaa, Rae rural municipality. In May 2010, the core business – as a separate company called Kalev Chocolate Factory – was sold to the Nordic food industry group Felix Abba, which is a subsidiary of the conglomerate Orkla Group. 

In the year 2018, AS Kalev merged with AS Põltsamaa Felix.Previously, AS Kalev was one of the few Estonian food industry enterprises based mainly on Estonian capital.

== Corporate affairs ==
The address in Tallinn&#x27;s Old Town is: Maiasmoka maja, Pikk tn 16, Tallinn. The group earns stable profits and now employs about 800 people.

<text>WABM (channel 68) is a television station in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Homewood-licensed CW affiliate WTTO (channel 21) and low-power ABC affiliate WBMA-LD (channel 58); Sinclair also operates Bessemer-licensed WDBB (channel 17), which serves as a full satellite station of WTTO, under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair partner company Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WDBB as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith.

WABM, WBMA-LD and WTTO share studios at the Riverchase office park on Concourse Parkway in Hoover (with a Birmingham mailing address); WABM&#x27;s transmitter is located at the American General candelabra tower on Red Mountain (near Interstate 65) in southwestern Birmingham.

==History==

===As an independent station===
The station first signed on the air on January 31, 1986, as WCAJ, originally operating as a religious independent station. Some of the initial programs that were featured on the station consisted of Catholic programs from the Irondale-based Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), as well as programming from the Southern Baptist Convention-owned American Christian Television System (ACTS); it initially also carried secular comedy, drama and western programming on weekday afternoons and evenings. Its original studio facilities were located on the campus of Samford University.

After the Trinity Broadcasting Network signed on WTJP-TV (channel 60) in Gadsden that July, WCAJ&#x27;s viewership declined significantly and the station was never able to recover for the remainder of its tenure as a religious outlet. By early 1987, WCAJ converted to a schedule consisting entirely of Christian programming. Eventually by that fall, the station added home shopping programming and infomercials to fill part of its schedule, while retaining some religious programs, which were relegated to mornings and late evenings; in 1990, the home shopping and infomercial programming was removed from the lineup, at which time the station reverted to an entirely religious schedule.

In 1990, the station was sold to Krypton Broadcasting, which changed its call letters to WABM and reformatted it into a general entertainment independent in January 1991; the reformatted lineup featured a mix of classic movies, dramas, and westerns. However, the station struggled at first against Fox affiliate WDBB (channel 17, now a CW affiliate) and its Gadsden-based satellite WNAL-TV (channel 44, now Ion Television affiliate WPXH-TV) and the market&#x27;s leading independent station, WTTO (channel 21, also now a CW affiliate).

Although the Birmingham market essentially covered three separate markets (including Tuscaloosa and Anniston–Gadsden), it was not nearly large enough population-wise at the time for what were essentially three independent stations, and there simply was not enough first-run syndicated and acquired programming to fill all of their schedules. In 1991, WDBB and WNAL became semi-satellites of WTTO, which had assumed the Fox affiliation for the market earlier that year, simulcasting that station&#x27;s programming 22 hours a day. As part of the deal, WDBB/WNAL moved their stronger programs onto WTTO&#x27;s schedule. This resulted in WTTO owning a large amount of programming that it no longer had time to air, so it sold a large amount of its cartoons and classic sitcoms to WABM.

Even with a stronger format, WABM still trailed WTTO in the ratings. Channel 68 had a disadvantage when it came to signal coverage, especially after WDBB and WNAL became full-time satellites of WTTO in 1993. Between those three stations, WTTO, WDBB and WNAL provided a strong combined signal comparable to those of ABC affiliate WBRC-TV (channel 6, now a Fox affiliate) and NBC affiliate WVTM-TV (channel 13). In contrast, WABM provided only a city-grade signal within the Birmingham metropolitan area, while transmitting a grade B signal in the western and northern parts of the market. WABM also suffered because Krypton had run into financial problems during the early 1990s, which placed WABM at a severe disadvantage when it came to acquiring the strongest programming.

After selling off its sister stations in West Palm Beach (WTVX, now a CW affiliate) and Jacksonville, Florida (WNFT, now CBS affiliate WJAX-TV), Krypton sold WABM to a small locally based group in 1993. The new owners immediately entered into a local marketing agreement with Abry-owned WTTO. Under the LMA, WTTO and WABM began sharing certain programs—although both stations continued to maintain separate schedules—and WTTO provided advertising services for WABM on their behalf. In September of that year, the station began carrying programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network syndication service. In 1994, Sinclair Broadcast Group assumed the rights to the LMA with WTTO/WDBB, when it acquired the latter upon its merger with Abry.

===UPN affiliation and brief disaffiliation===
On January 16, 1995, WABM became the Birmingham charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN). However, it essentially continued to program as an independent station, since UPN only provided prime time programming on Monday and Tuesday evenings when the network launched (and would not carry five nights a week of programming until September 1998). It was one of three stations unaffected by the September 1996 affiliation switches that saw WBRC become a Fox owned-and-operated station, and its longtime ABC affiliation move to WBMA-LD (channel 58) and former CBS affiliates WCFT-TV (channel 33, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WSES) in Tuscaloosa and WJSU-TV (channel 40, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WGWW) in Anniston.

In March 1998, WABM disaffiliated from UPN over concerns by Sinclair over ratings and monetary issues, as other stations owned by the company did in several additional markets following Sinclair&#x27;s signing of a lucrative affiliation deal with The WB (which WTTO/WDBB affiliated with in an unrelated deal two years earlier). For five months, the station reverted to being an independent station, though the only effect on the station&#x27;s schedule was the replacement of UPN programming with syndicated film packages during prime time and on Saturday afternoons, and infomercials taking the place of the network&#x27;s UPN Kids block on Sunday mornings. In the interim, local cable providers began carrying the network&#x27;s Secaucus, New Jersey–New York City-based flagship, WWOR-TV, to allow UPN programming to remain available in the Birmingham market; on the fringes of the market, the network was available only on cable systems through one of two out-of-market stations, WUPA in Atlanta and WGSA in Baxley–Savannah, Georgia, as most providers had dropped WWOR&#x27;s &quot;superstation&quot; cable feed earlier in the decade due to the lack of interesting programming used to replace shows seen on the main WWOR signal after SyndEx rules went into effect, and the cable feed had been discontinued by satellite distribution rightsholder Advance Entertainment Corporation one year earlier and lent to Discovery Communications to increase national distribution for Animal Planet.

However, the loss of UPN created a side effect for WABM, as it experienced a decline in viewership without a network affiliation. Complaints were also lodged to the station from vocal &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans whose only option for watching &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; were either by seeing it through UPN affiliates from other markets over-the-air or on cable, a subscription to Dish Network, DirecTV or PrimeStar to receive distant UPN stations via the satellite providers&#x27; respective &quot;superstation&quot; packages, or through tape trading. Sinclair would eventually reach a new affiliation pact with the network for the stations which lost their UPN affiliations but did not subsequently join The WB. After WABM re-affiliated with UPN on August 10, 1998, WWOR was dropped from the few area cable systems that carried it within days of WABM&#x27;s reunion with the network. To make up for the preemptions of the program caused by the disaffiliation, WABM aired an all-day &quot;Voyager&quot; marathon that November, showing all thirteen episodes that WABM was not able to air during the second half of the 1997–98 season, with the permission of UPN and the program&#x27;s production company, Paramount Television.

By the late 1990s, the station began to reduce the amount of classic sitcoms, movies and syndicated cartoons (such as &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;) on its schedule, in favor of more recent sitcoms and the addition of talk, reality and court shows. Channel 68 continued to air animated series on weekday mornings until August 2003, when UPN discontinued its children&#x27;s program block, &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot;. On May 20, 2000, more than a decade after most television stations had converted to the audio format, WABM began transmitting its programming with stereophonic sound. In 2001, Sinclair purchased WABM outright, creating the Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market&#x27;s first television duopoly with WTTO/WDBB.

===MyNetworkTV affiliation===
On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of MyNetworkTV, a new &quot;sixth&quot; broadcast network that would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created to compete against another upstart network that would launch at the same time that September, The CW (which assumed the scheduling model and most programming operations of The WB, but originally consisted primarily of a mix of UPN and The WB&#x27;s higher-rated programs) as well as to give UPN- and WB-affiliated stations that were not named as charter CW affiliates another option besides converting into independent stations.

On March 1, 2006 (five days before Sinclair announced an agreement to affiliate 17 of its UPN, WB and independent stations with the network), Sinclair Broadcast Group and Fox Entertainment Group announced that WABM would become the market&#x27;s charter affiliate of MyNetworkTV. WABM joined the network when MyNetworkTV launched on September 5, 2006; WTTO/WDBB became Central Alabama&#x27;s CW charter affiliate when that network launched on September 18. For a time, WABM had considered acquiring the local broadcast rights to 4Kids TV, the Fox network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block via a time-lease agreement with 4Kids Entertainment. Sister station WTTO had continued to carry its predecessor, Fox Kids, even after it lost the Fox affiliation to WBRC in September 1996; it dropped Fox Kids programming in the fall of 2000, however WBRC did not acquire the rights to the block, leaving it and future blocks programmed by 4Kids Entertainment unavailable in the Birmingham market. WABM eventually picked up Fox&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; paid programming block in lieu of WBRC, when it replaced 4Kids TV in December 2008.

===WBMA simulcast on WABM-DT2 and -DT3===
On July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications announced that it would sell its seven television stations, including WBMA-LD and its satellite stations, WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV, to Sinclair, which purchased the stations for $985 million. As part of the deal, Sinclair had intended to sell the license assets of WABM and WTTO to Deerfield Media, and retain operational responsibilities for those stations through shared services and joint sales agreements. However, on December 6, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) informed Sinclair that all related applications to the deal need to be &quot;amended or withdrawn&quot;, due to a longstanding time-brokerage agreement between WTTO and WDBB (which is nominally owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, a Sinclair partner company whose stock is majority owned by the family of the latter group&#x27;s founder, Julian Sinclair Smith). The original structure of the deal would have effectively created a new LMA between WBMA and WDBB, even though the Commission had ruled in 1999 that such agreements made after November 5, 1996, covering more than 15% of the broadcast day would count toward the ownership limits for the brokering station&#x27;s owner.

On March 20, 2014, as part of a restructuring of the deal in order to address these ownership conflicts as well as to expedite the Allbritton acquisition because of them due to the FCC&#x27;s increased scrutiny of outsourcing agreements used to circumvent in-market ownership caps, Sinclair announced that it would sell WABM to a third-party buyer and retain ownership of WTTO (as well as the outsourcing agreement with Cunningham for WDBB), forming a new duopoly with WBMA+ acting as the senior partner. Sinclair would not enter into a sharing arrangement with or maintain any contingent interest in WABM, other than a possible transitional shared facilities agreement until WTTO&#x27;s operations were migrated from its existing studios on Beacon Parkway West to WBMA&#x27;s facilities in Hoover. On May 29, 2014, Sinclair informed the FCC that it had not found a buyer for WABM (even among the market&#x27;s three existing major station owners, WBRC owner Raycom Media, then-WVTM owner Media General and then-WIAT owner LIN Media, neither of which operated an existing duopoly station in the Birmingham market, although the latter two groups were in the process of merging at the time, with Media General eventually selling WVTM to Hearst Television); it proposed another restructured plan, in which it would surrender the WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV licenses, and have WABM simulcast WBMA-LD (which, as a low-power station, would not be affected as FCC rules allow the ownership of low-power and full-power stations regardless of market ownership caps for duopolies) as a full-power satellite, with its existing syndicated and MyNetworkTV programming on its main channel being moved to a digital subchannel. Sinclair opted to retain WABM on the basis that its transmitter facilities are superior to those of WCFT and WJSU; indeed, moving ABC programming to WABM would give ABC a full-power affiliate in Birmingham itself for the first time since 1996.

On September 18, 2014 (a month and a half after Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of Allbritton Communications was finalized on August 1), WABM began simulcasting WBMA-LD&#x27;s main channel on digital subchannel 68.2 in preparation for the planned shutdown of WCFT and WJSU eleven days later on September 29 (which would be aborted five days prior to the shutdown date on September 24, when Sinclair agreed to instead sell WCFT and WJSU to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000, foregoing any operational agreements with the company for the stations). WBMA-LD&#x27;s main ABC programming and its &quot;James Spann 24/7 Weather&quot; channel were restored on WJSU&#x27;s second and third subchannels on December 3, 2014.

==Sports programming==
From 1992 to 2014, WABM held the local broadcast rights to college football and basketball games from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) through Raycom Sports and its predecessor sports syndication services (with games televised as part of its ACC Network arm from 2009 to 2019), airing most regular season games from selected conference teams each year as well as games from the first three rounds of the ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament. When the SEC Network debuted, however, it wound up on WTTO instead. In August 2014, WABM became a charter outlet of the Sinclair-owned American Sports Network ad hoc syndication service, carrying mainly college sports events; as a result, the ACC Network broadcast rights for the Birmingham market were migrated to sister station WTTO/WDBB from 2015 to 2019.

WABM has locally broadcast Birmingham Legion FC soccer since the club began play in the USL Championship in 2019. WABM is also the local broadcast home for the Birmingham Squadron of the NBA G League.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


On October 4, 2010, WABM launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 68.2 as an affiliate of TheCoolTV; the network was removed from the subchannel on August 31, 2012, after Sinclair dropped the music video network on 32 of its then-approximately 70 stations nationwide. The subchannel was reactivated on September 18, 2014, to act as a simulcast feed of WBMA-LD.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On February 2, 2009, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced to all cable and satellite television providers carrying its television stations via an e-mail release that regardless of the exact date of the mandatory switchover to digital-only broadcasting for full-power stations (which Congress rescheduled days later to June 12), its stations (including WABM) would shut down their analog signals on the originally scheduled transition date of February 17.

WABM shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 68, at 11:59 p.m. on that date. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using virtual channel 68. As part of the SAFER Act, WABM kept its analog signal on the air until March 19 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

With the digital conversion, WABM moved its transmitter facilities from its analog transmitter site near Ishkooda Road (overlooking Elmwood Cemetery), across the western side of Red Mountain to the American General candelabra transmitter facility overlooking downtown Birmingham, where WTTO&#x27;s transmitter is based.

<doc id="1169618" wikidata="Q151623" url="?curid=1169618" title="Maria Nagaya">
<text>Maria Feodorovna Nagaya, named Marfa as a nun (; died 1608/1610/1612) was a Russian tsarina as the last (sixth, possibly seventh or eighth) wife of Ivan the Terrible. She was mother of Tsarevich Dmitry of Uglich and played a role in the reign and deposition of False Dmitry I.

== Ancestry and early life ==
Maria Feodorovna was the daughter of the &quot;okolnichy&quot; . It has been suggested by historian-genealogists N.V. Myatlev and Anatoly Gryaznoy that Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s mother was a daughter or sister of Prince Vasily Semenovich Funikov-Kemsky and brought the fiefdom of Zvenigorod to the family as her dowry.

== Marriage to Ivan IV ==
Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s uncle, , was the Russian ambassador to the Crimean Khanate and a close confidant of Tsar Ivan IV. This probably contributed to Ivan&#x27;s decision to marry Maria Feodorovna. They wed in 1580.

Ivan had had five confirmed wives before, as well as a possible sixth and seventh (whose existence is disputed). The Russian Orthodox Church only recognised his first four marriages as legal. (Men were permitted to take three wives, and Ivan had gained special permission to marry for a fourth time by claiming that he had not consummated his third marriage.)

Contemporary English diplomat Jerome Horsey claims that Ivan married Maria Feodorovna after repudiating his previous wife in order to pacify his son Ivan Ivanovich and the boyars, who were worried by rumors that the Tsar planned to flee to England. This is, however, only speculation. The wedding took place in an intimate setting, in the presence of Ivan&#x27;s trusted courtiers. On 19 October 1582, Maria Feodorovna gave birth to her only child, Dmitry of Uglich. Dmitry was Ivan IV&#x27;s third child to survive infancy. He already had two adult sons, Ivan Ivanovich and Feodor Ivanovich from his first marriage. Ivan Ivanovich died a month after Dmitry&#x27;s birth, probably killed by his father during an argument. This made Feodor Ivanovich, a man of weak health, the heir apparent.

== During the reign of Feodor I ==

=== Exile to Uglich ===
Upon the death of Ivan IV in 1584 and the accession of Feodor I, Maria Feodorovna, her son (now the heir presumptive), and her brothers were immediately removed from court by the regency council (which had been appointed to rule by Ivan IV on account of Feodor&#x27;s physical and mental frailty). They were sent to live in Uglich, her son&#x27;s principality. Jerome Horsey writes that she was supplied with a fitting number of attendants, dresses, jewellery, food, horses, and other necessary possessions.

A later account, the ‘New Chronicler’ alleges that the Nagoys were the victims of a conspiracy by Boris Godunov, who exiled or imprisoned the late Tsar&#x27;s favourites and confiscated their wealth. However, this rendering of the story was intended to smear Godunov. The decision to expel the Nagoys from Moscow was probably made by the entire Duma. They feared that the family would act against Tsar Feodor to place their young relative, Tsarevich Dmitry on the throne and thereby grab power for themselves. It is nevertheless certain that numerous relatives of Maria Feodorovna were banished. According to some sources, Feodor also forbade priests to commemorate Tsarevich Dmitry in religious services due to his illegitimacy (his parents&#x27; marriage being invalid in the eyes of the church).
=== Death of Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich ===
On 15 May 1591, Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s son Dmitry died under mysterious circumstances. He was found on the ground of the courtyard with his throat slit. Maria Feodorovna ran to the scene, beat Dmitry&#x27;s nanny Vasilisa Volokhova with a log, and accused Volokhova&#x27;s son, Osip Volokhov, as well as Daniil Bityagovsky and Nikita Kachalov of killing the Tsarevich. The bells of the town were rung to alert people, who gathered in confusion. The father of Daniil, Mikhail Bityagovsky, attempted to calm tensions, but was murdered. The crowd then lynched the rest of the accused. These events and the subsequent investigation is known as the in Russia.

The investigation concluded that the Tsarevich had died in an accident and that the Nagoys falsified evidence to the contrary. There is no conclusion among historians on the death of Dmitry and the surrounding events. Maria Feodorovna and her brothers were convicted of neglecting the Tsarevich and of the murder of those lynched on 15 May. The men were imprisoned and Maria Feodorovna forced to become a nun under the name of Marfa. She was held either in the Sudin Monastery, located near Vyksa or Cherepovets, or in the Nikolovyksinskaya Hermitage.

== During the reign of Boris Godunov ==

In 1598, Feodor I died. Rumors spread that Dmitry of Uglich had survived in secrecy. In 1604, Boris Godunov summoned Maria Feodorovna to Moscow, but she did not provide useful information and was sent back. Based on an account by the contemporary Dutch merchant and diplomat Isaac Massa, Maria Feodorovna was taken into Godunov&#x27;s bedroom in secret at night. ‘Tell the truth, is your son alive or not?’, Boris is said to have asked. Maria Feodorovna claimed not to know. Godunov&#x27;s wife, Maria Grigorievna, took up a lighted candle, screaming at Maria Feodorovna, ‘Oh, you w[hore]! You dare to say “I don&#x27;t know”―when you know certainly!’, then threw the candle in her eyes. Godunov protected Maria Feodorovna from his wife&#x27;s attack. According to Massa, Maria Feodorovna then stated that she had been informed that her son was smuggled abroad, but that the people who told her this were no longer alive. Infuriated, Godunov ordered that she should be watched more stricly and live under more severe circumstances than before.

== During the reign of False Dmitry I ==
On 18 July 1605, Maria Feodorovna made a ceremonial entry into Moscow, where she recognized False Dmitry I as her son. She settled in the Kremlin&#x27;s Ascension Convent, and her family members were freed and restored to their ranks and properties. She received his alleged son&#x27;s bride, Marina Mniszech, as was customary for a tsar&#x27;s mother.

At an unspecified time, a Swedish man appeared in Poland, claiming that he had been sent by Maria Feodorovna from Moscow. He relayed to King Sigismund III of Poland, as well as to Marina Mciszech&#x27;s father, that Maria Feodorovna considered Dmitry I a ‘deceiver’. Maria Feodorovna had allegedly complied with recognising him as her son ‘for her own reasons’, but now accused him of attempting to desecrate the grave of her real son. She, ‘being a mother, felt very sorry’ and ‘prevented this’. Mykola Kostomarov believes that this message was sent by boyars conspiring to depose Dmitry. It is unknown whether Maria Feodorovna was aware of what was said in her name. In the meantime, the Nagoy family played a prominent part at the wedding Dmitry I.

=== Murder of False Dmitry ===
When False Dmitry was murdered in 1606, Maria Feodorovna refused to acknowledge him as her son. An assailant slapped Dmitry and demanded that he identify himself. Dmitry replied that he was the Tsar, son of Ivan IV, then urged them to ask his ‘mother’ for proof. Prince Ivan Golitsyn shouted, ‘I have just been with the Tsarina Marfa; she says that this is not her son: she recognised him against her will, fearing murder, and now she renounces him!’ Vasili Shuysky rode on horseback into the courtyard and confirmed to the crowd that the only son of Maria Feodorovna had died in Uglich. After this, False Dmitry was killed.

The mob dragging his body stopped at the Ascension Convent, calling out to Maria Feodorovna, ‘Speak, Tsarina Marfa, is this your son?’ Different sources give her reaction differently. According to the &quot;Notes of Nemoevsky&quot;, Maria Feodorovna simply answered ‘Not mine!’. According to others, she said, ‘You should have asked me when he was alive, but now, since you killed him, he is no longer mine!’. The &quot;Jesuit Notes&quot; report that she first answered, ‘You know better’, and when the crowd began threatening her, she added confidently, ‘This is not my son at all’. On 3 June 1606, she solemnly received the relics of her son Tsarevich Dmitry as they arrived to Moscow from Uglich.

== Later life and death ==
In 1607, Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s brother Mikhail was sent by Tsar Vasili IV Shuysky to Yelets with a letter from Tsarina Maria Feodorovna and an image of Tsarevich Dmitry to admonish the rebellious people of Seversk and certify Dmitry&#x27;s death. In 1609, along with other commanders, he defended Moscow from Polish attacks and the supporters of False Dmitry II.

Different sources give different dates for Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s death: 1608, 1610, or 1612. Her gravestone, preserved in the Kremlin reads, ‘[i]n the year 7116 [1608], on the 28th of June, the servant of God, nun Tsarina Maria Feodorovna of Tsar Ivan of All Russia, passed away’.

<text>James Masterton (born 2 September 1973) is a British music critic and columnist, his work focusing on the UK Singles Chart having been an online fixture on various sites since the 1990s. Masterton is also a producer for talkSPORT, and has worked on air as a presenter at the Bradford independent local radio station the Pulse.

==Music writing==
Masterton began posting his weekly comments about the latest singles chart on Usenet in 1992, while a student at Lancaster University, whence he graduated in 1994. In 1995 he became an important element of BT&#x27;s Dotmusic website, an online hub for the UK music scene and one of the few sites that posted the entire UK top 75 every week. When Dotmusic was purchased from BT by Yahoo! on 28 October 2003, Masterton&#x27;s commentary moved to Yahoo! Launch with it, remaining with the site as it transformed into Yahoo! Music UK and Ireland until the site&#x27;s closure in September 2011. His chart column moved to About.com, where it remained until the summer of 2016. It finally moved to its own site Chart Watch UK where it has been a weekly fixture ever since. To coincide with the move the complete archives were put online, featuring many articles which had been unavailable since their original week of publication.

Masterton has come into conflict in the past for his strident views on the work of particular veteran acts and in particular for his criticism of fan-inspired chart campaigns. In 2009, he was openly critical of the campaign to get Rage Against the Machine to number one for Christmas, blasting the record (&quot;Killing in the Name&quot;) as having been &quot;purchased by people for what it represents rather than as a reflection of its cultural popularity&quot; and provoked anger amongst fans of the Pet Shop Boys for asking &quot;why they continue to bother&quot; when their album &quot;Yes&quot; was released.

On 28 February 2020, Masterton published his UK charts analysis page (Week Ending: 5 March 2020) to Chart Watch UK intending the post to be his last weekly edition as he was hired to take over the weekly Charts Analysis review pages from Alan Jones on the Music Week website (with the feature also appearing weekly in the magazine until Future Publishing turned it into a monthly). Masterton wrote two weekly Charts Analysis pages for the website (as the magazine now features charts compiled from monthly sales and streams) until 29 October 2021, when Music Week staff took over the job. After Andre Paine and Ben Homewood wrote one each of the Charts Analysis posts on 5 November 2021, Alan Jones took over his old job, writing the 12 November overviews (with the pages titled &quot;Charts analysis: ABBA&#x27;s Voyage opens with huge sale of 204,000&quot; for the albums and &quot;Charts analysis: Adele spends fourth week at summit ahead of album release&quot; for the singles).

Apart from an overview of the Christmas (Week Ending: 31 December 2020 and 7 January 2021) and Easter charts (Week Ending: 8 April 2021) posted as there was no updates by Music Week due to the holidays, Masterton did not return to writing a regular column on his Chart Watch UK review pages until 6 November 2021, when he posted the 11 November overview with facts about Adele&#x27;s number one single &quot;Easy On Me&quot;, Ed Sheeran&#x27;s new album and Halloween associated records in the charts.

==Media appearances==
Masterton has made numerous appearances on TV and radio as an authority on music and chart matters. He has appeared on BBC News 24&#x27;s &quot;Zero 30&quot; programme, as a talking head on the Channel 4 show &quot;100 Worst Pop Records&quot; and on the BBC News Channel segment &quot;E24&quot;.

<doc id="1169621" wikidata="Q4686785" url="?curid=1169621" title="Advice (programming)">
<text>In aspect and functional programming, advice describes a class of functions which modify other functions when the latter are run; it is a certain function, method or procedure that is to be applied at a given join point of a program.

==Use==
The practical use of advice functions is generally to modify or otherwise extend the behavior of functions which cannot or should not be readily modified or extended. For instance, the Emacspeak Emacs-addon makes extensive use of advice: it must modify thousands of existing Emacs modules and functions such that it can produce audio output for the blind corresponding to the visual presentation, but it would be infeasible to copy all of them and redefine them to produce audio output in addition to their normal outputs; so, the Emacspeak programmers define advice functions which run before and after.

For a simple Emacs example: suppose after a user corrected a mis-spelled word using the Emacs ispell module, they wanted to re-spellcheck the entire buffer. codice_1 offers no such functionality, even if the corrected word appears frequently in the buffer. The user &quot;could&quot; track down the definition of codice_1, copy it into their personal Emacs files, and add the desired functionality there, but this is tedious and, worse, brittle (the user&#x27;s version is now out of sync with the core Emacs implementation, if it even works without further refactoring). What the user wants is quite simple — just to run another command any time codice_1 runs. Using advice, it can be done as simply as this:
 (advice-add #&#x27;ispell-word
 :after #&#x27;flyspell-buffer)
While this example is obviously trivial, the strength of advice, especially when compared to similar facilities such as Python decorators and Java annotations, lies in the fact that not only do the advised functions / methods not need to be designed to accept advice, but also the advice themselves need not be designed to be usable as advice - they&#x27;re just normal functions. The availability of evaluation throughout the lifetime of a piece of code (cf. code staging) in Lisp allows advice to be inlined automatically into any other code in a variety of ways. Any piece of code can be advised to carry out any other computation before, after, around, or instead of its original definition.

=== Readability ===
Advice has the potential to introduce confusion, as a piece of advice applied to a function is not apparent to a user who tracks down the function&#x27;s source definition to learn about it. In such cases, advice acts almost like a COMEFROM, a joke facility added to INTERCAL to spoof the spaghettification attendant to the extensive use of GOTOs. In practice, however, such issues rarely present themselves. Upstream developers and maintainers of Lisp packages and modules never use advice, since there is no advantage to be gained by advising functions when their original source definitions can be freely rewritten to include the desired features. Advice is only useful in that it enables downstream users to subsequently modify default behaviour in a way that does not require propagation of such modifications into the core implementation&#x27;s source definition.

==Implementations==
A form of advices were part of C with Classes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, namely functions called codice_4 and codice_5 defined in a class, which were called before (respectively, after) member functions of the class. However, these were dropped from C++.

Advices are part of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), as codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8 methods, which are combined with the primary method under &quot;standard method combination&quot;.

Common Lisp implementations provide advice functionality (in addition to the standard method combination for CLOS) as extensions. LispWorks supports advising functions, macros and CLOS methods.

EmacsLisp added advice-related code in version 19.28, 1994.

==History ==
The following is taken from a discussion at the mailing list aosd-discuss. Pascal Costanza contributed the following:

The term &quot;advice&quot; goes back to the term &quot;advising&quot; as introduced by Warren Teitelman in his PhD thesis in 1966. Here is a quote from Chapter 3 of his thesis:

:Advising is the basic innovation in the model, and in the PILOT system. Advising consists of inserting new procedures at any or all of the entry or exit points to a particular procedure (or class of procedures). The procedures inserted are called &quot;advice procedures&quot; or simply &quot;advice&quot;.
:Since each piece of advice is itself a procedure, it has its own entries and exits. In particular, this means that the execution of advice can cause the procedure that it modifies to be bypassed completely, e.g., by specifying as an exit from the advice one of the exits from the original procedure; or the advice may change essential variables and continue with the computation so that the original procedure is executed, but with modified variables. Finally, the advice may not alter the execution or affect the original procedure at all, e.g., it may merely perform some additional computation such as printing a message or recording history. Since advice can be conditional, the decision as to what is to be done can depend on the results of the computation up to that point.
:The principal advantage of advising is that the user need not be concerned about the details of the actual changes in his program, nor the internal representation of advice. He can treat the procedure to be advised &quot;as a unit&quot;, a single block, and make changes to it without concern for the particulars of this block. This may be contrasted with editing in which the programmer must be cognizant of the internal structure of the procedure.

&quot;Advising&quot; found its way into BBN Lisp and later into Xerox PARC&#x27;s Interlisp.

It also found its way to Flavors, the first object-oriented extension to Lisp developed at MIT. They were subsumed under the notion of method combination.

Since method combination and macros are closely related, it&#x27;s also interesting to note that the first macro system was described in 1963, three years before Warren Teitelman&#x27;s PhD thesis.

<text>Marcus Vettius Bolanus (c. 33 – 76) was a Roman senator and soldier. He was suffect consul for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September-December 66 as the colleague of Marcus Arruntius Aquila.

== Career ==
Bolanus served in Anatolia under Corbulo in 62. He became governor of Britain in 69 in the midst of the Year of four emperors, appointed by the short-lived emperor Vitellius. His predecessor, Marcus Trebellius Maximus, had been undermined and forced to flee by a mutiny led by Marcus Roscius Coelius, commander of &quot;Legio XX Valeria Victrix&quot;. Bolanus was joined by &quot;Legio XIV Gemina&quot;, which had been withdrawn from Britain in 67 and was still loyal to Vitellius&#x27;s defeated opponent, Otho.

Bolanus had to face the second insurrection of Venutius amongst the Brigantes. Cartimandua, Venutius&#x27;s ex-wife and queen of the Brigantes, had been a loyal client ruler for twenty years, and the Romans had defended her against an earlier revolt by her ex-husband. On this occasion, however, Bolanus was only able to send auxiliaries. Cartimandua was evacuated, leaving the kingdom to Venutius.

By the end of 69, Vespasian had established himself as emperor and set about restoring control. The XIVth Gemina was withdrawn again in 70 to help put down unrest on the lower Rhine, and Roscius Coelius was replaced as commander of XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; by Gnaeus Julius Agricola. Bolanus remained as governor until 71. The poet Statius speaks of him establishing forts and capturing trophies from a British king, which suggests that he was able to reconquer some of the territory lost in the revolt. He was succeeded by Quintus Petillius Cerialis.

For 75/76, Bolanus was appointed governor of Asia.

<text>Warchild is a science fiction novel by Canadian writer Karin Lowachee. It was published by Warner Aspect in 2002. It won the Warner Aspect First Novel Award. &quot;Warchild&quot; was also a finalist for the 2002 Philip K. Dick Award.

==Plot summary==

The story starts when eight-year-old Joslyn Musey&#x27;s parents die in a vicious pirate attack on his home ship, the merchant &quot;Mukudori&quot;. Jos, along with a handful of the ships other children, are captured by the attackers. Vincenzo Marcus Falcone, an infamous pirate and captain of the &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;, keeps Jos as his hostage, with the intention of making him a protégé. Falcone teaches Jos how to &quot;win people over&quot; with manners and cunning, and especially good looks.

The human race, EarthHub, is at war with aliens called the striviirc-na, who are called &quot;strits&quot; by the Hub. When the pirate ship &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; docks at Chaos Station, which is located in deep space, the station is suddenly attacked by the striviiric-na. Jos escapes Falcone during the attack, but is shot, then captured and is taken to the alien homeworld, Aaian-na, by the Warboy, the leader of the human sympathizer movement on Aaian-na, Nikolas S&#x27;tlian. Jos gradually accepts his place on Aaian-na and the Warboy teaches him to be a Ka&#x27;redan, or &quot;assassin-priest&quot; which is the ruling caste on the planet.

Jos is trained on Aaian-na until he is fourteen, when he is formally made a member of the Ka&#x27;redan. At that time, being told that the only way to end the war is through a treaty with EarthHub&#x27;s most notorious spacecarrier, the &quot;Macedon&quot;, he is assigned to spy on the ship as part of its elite crew. Jos is taught to act like an Earthhub human and sent back to Austo Station in the Hub to join the Macedon. Once on the Macedon, however, he discovers that his previous distinctions between good and bad no longer apply.

Jos battles on the Macedon, eventually encountering Evan D&#x27;Silva, one of his former friends on the Mukudori, who he rescues from a pirate ship. He discovers a connection between the Warboy&#x27;s brother, Ash-dan, and Falcone&#x27;s pirates, who have been trading weapons to the sympathizers in exchange for aid in hiding captured children.

The novel ends with a face off between the &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; and the &quot;Macedon&quot;. The &quot;Macedon&quot; encounters the &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; meeting with the Warboy&#x27;s brother&#x27;s ship, and is boarded by the pirates. Jos and his unit are captured by the Khan and Jos is interrogated by Falcone. It is eventually revealed to his ship mates that he is spying for the Warboy. However, at that point, the Warboy, who had been tracking his brother, shows up with his ship, and his crew release Jos and the other prisoners and takes them to his ship.

The Warboy&#x27;s ship then helps the &quot;Macedon&quot; destroy the pirate ships, after which &quot;Macedon&#x27;s&quot; Captain, Cairo Azarcon, arranges for the Warboy to dock on Chaos Station. Jos encounters Falcone on deck, being transported to police facilities, when Falcone attempts to escape. Jos then stabs Falcone to death on deck, after which he is taken back to the &quot;Macedon&quot; under Captain Azarcon&#x27;s protection. He is made a liaison officer as Azarcon attempts to negotiate a peace treaty with the striviiric-na.

<doc id="1169631" wikidata="Q706743" url="?curid=1169631" title="Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal">
<text>Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal (23 September 1924 – 10 January 1978) was a Nicaraguan journalist and publisher. He was the editor of &quot;La Prensa&quot;, the only significant opposition newspaper to the long rule of the Somoza family. He is a 1977 laureate of the Maria Moors Cabot Prize of Columbia University in New York. He married Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who later went on to become President of Nicaragua (1990–1997). In 1978, he was shot to death, one of the precipitating events of the overthrow of the Somoza regime the following year.

==Background==
Chamorro was a son of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Zelaya and wife Margarita Cardenal Argüello and paternal grandson of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Bolaños and wife Ana María Zelaya Bolaños. He was the maternal grandson of Salvador Cardenal Saborío (son of Pedro Cardenal Ayerdi and wife Ana Ma. Saborio Bonilla), and wife Isabel Argüello Prado (daughter of Pedro Argüello Argüello and wife Leocadia Parado y Méndez). Both were relatives of Leonardo Argüello, 66th President of Nicaragua. His great-grandparents were Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Alfaro, 39th President of Nicaragua, and wife María de la Luz Bolaños Bendaña.

He had two brothers, Jaime Chamorro Cardenal and Xavier Chamorro Cardenal, and two sisters, Ligia Chamorro Cardenal, married to Samuel Barreto Argüello (grandchild of president Leonardo Arguello) and Ana María Chamorro Cardenal, married to Carlos Holmann Thompson (son of Edgard T. Holmann Reinecke and wife Carolina Thompson Gutierrez) from San Juan del Sur, parents of Eduardo, Verónica, Hugo Martín, Ana Carolina, Bruno, Ericka, and Juan Lorenzo Holmann Chamorro.

==Murder and legacy==
Chamorro wrote a letter in 1975 to Somoza: &quot;I am waiting, with a clear conscience, and a soul at peace, for the blow you are to deliver.&quot; Three years later, in January 1978, Chamorro was killed by unknown gunmen who pulled up beside him in a car and opened fire with shotguns. Somoza claimed Chamorro was assassinated by Pedro Ramos, a Cuban-American entrepreneur whose business had been attacked by &quot;La Prensa&quot;. At the time, however, the Chamorro family and the wealthy opposition held that Somoza had ordered him killed. Ramos took refuge in Miami, where he died. He was tried in absentia and found guilty of murder after the revolution, but he never returned to Nicaragua.

At his funeral, thousands of people followed the coffin from Managua&#x27;s Oriental Hospital to the Chamorro family home, taking turns carrying it.

Following Chamorro&#x27;s murder, an estimated 30,000 people rioted in the streets of Managua. Cars were set on fire and several buildings belonging to the Somoza family were attacked. A general strike was called. Outside the capital, unrest flared in a number of cities and towns, particularly in areas where National Guardsmen had massacred peasant farmers during the counterinsurgency effort. The government responded with further violence and reintroduced martial law censorship. During 1978, there were seven machine gun attacks and attempted bombings of La Prensa, now under the management of Chamorro&#x27;s widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Following Somoza&#x27;s overthrow, she was a part of the FSLN-based junta from 1979 to 1980. She later broke with the FSLN and was elected president of Nicaragua in 1990.

Speaking about her husband to the participants of the 1998 IPI World Congress in Moscow, Violeta said: &quot;During his whole life, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro was a tireless fighter for democracy in Nicaragua and against the dictatorship of Somoza. This cost him incarceration, torture, exile and finally death. He was warned many times that plans existed to assassinate him, yet no threat detained him from fulfilling his mission to impart the truth and preach democracy.&quot;

They had four children: 
* Claudia Lucía Chamorro Barrios, married to Edmundo Jarquín, a relative of Carlos Alberto Brenes, 64th President of Nicaragua. Claudia was a Sandinista activist and ambassador to Cuba and Costa Rica in the 1980s. She and her family moved to the United States in 1991 to seek medical care when one of her sons was diagnosed with leukemia.
* Cristiana Chamorro Barrios, married to Antonio Lacayo, leading minister in President Chamorro Barrios&#x27; cabinet, and later a candidate for the Presidency. She became editor of &quot;La Prensa&quot;.
* Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Barrios, married to Martha Lucía Urcuyo. He was a journalist and later a politician that ran for mayor of Nicaragua&#x27;s capital city of Managua. He was also a Contra leader who spent time in exile in Costa Rica, while his sister Claudia was ambassador on behalf of the FSLN government.
*Carlos Fernando Chamorro, head of the official newspaper of the Sandinista Government, &quot;Barricada&quot;, and later a women&#x27;s rights activist and independent investigative journalist. Chamorro was fired from &quot;Barricada&quot; by the FSLN in 1994 for refusing to bow to party censorship.

In 2000 he was named one of International Press Institute&#x27;s 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past fifty years.

== &quot;Bloody Lineage: The Somozas&quot; (&quot;Estirpe Sangrienta: Los Somoza&quot;) ==
In 1957, &quot;Bloody Lineage: The Somozas&quot; was published by Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in which he provides a detailed examination of the Somoza family&#x27;s rule in Nicaragua. The book is regarded as an important source for understanding the political landscape of the time and the dynamics of power in the country. In this book, Chamorro recounts his experiences, including periods of imprisonment and conflict, to provide context to the regime&#x27;s impact on society. The book combines personal narrative with historical analysis, highlighting the era&#x27;s political challenges and social conditions while reflecting on themes of institutional governance, civil rights, and the pursuit of justice, contributing to discussions on Nicaragua&#x27;s political history and aspirations for reform.

<text>The Junker mutiny () was a Russian counterrevolutionary mutiny of military school cadets in Petrograd against the Bolsheviks in October 1917.

On October 29 (November 11 (N.S.)) of 1917, students of junker schools in Petrograd rose up against the Bolsheviks under the leadership of the Committee for Salvation of Motherland and Revolution (Комитет спасения родины и революции), organised by the Right Esers. The goal of the mutiny was to support the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising (October 26–31, 1917). The rebellious students wanted to seize the city telephone exchange, Peter and Paul Fortress, Smolny and arrest the Soviet government together with the Bolshevik leaders.

On October 29, the Red Guard patrol detained one of the leaders of the Junker mutiny, an Eser named Aleksandr Arnoldovich Bruderer, who had a plan of the mutiny with him. Former Commander-in-Chief of the Petrograd military okrug, Colonel Georgi Polkovnikov, pronounced himself as commander of the so-called &quot;Salvation Army&quot; (войска спасения) and ordered his garrison not to execute orders issued by the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee (PMRC), arrest its commissars, and send representatives from all military units to Nikolayevskoye School of Engineers (a.k.a. Engineer&#x27;s Fortress), the headquarters of the mutiny leaders. The junkers of the Nikolayevskoye School of Engineers seized the Mikhailovsky Manege, stole a number of armored cars, captured the city telephone exchange, cut off power in Smolny, seized Hotel Astoria, and began to disarm the Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers. The students of Vladimirskoye Military School disarmed the school guards and arrested some of the PMRC commissars. At 8:30 a.m. on October 29, the leaders of the Junker mutiny sent out telegrams all over Petrograd, announcing the success of the rebellion and calling out for the arrest of all the PMRC commissars and the concentration of participating military units at the Nikolayevskoye School of Engineers.

The revolutionary garrison of Petrograd, however, refused to support the mutiny. PMRC issued an appeal to the citizens of Petrograd and announced the state of siege. By 11 a.m. of October 29, the Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers had regained control over the telephone exchange and surrounded the Engineer&#x27;s Fortress. Most of the junkers fled, but those who remained would be disarmed by 5 p.m. and sent to the Peter and Paul Fortress. The junkers opened fire on the 56th regiment of Kremlin guards that were sympathetic to the Bolsheviks and had agreed to surrender to the junkers in exchange for their freedom. However, all of them were shot with up to 300 people killed. The Vladimir military school was subjected to severe artillery shelling by the Bolshevik troops. Hundreds of junkers were killed or injured in the fighting. After the surrender of the schools dozens of junkers were shot at the walls of the Peter and Paul Fortress according to the testimony of Countess Lilli Nostitz. Conversely, 238 Red Guards had been killed in the service of the Soviet regime were buried. However, some Bolshevik commanders such as Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko protected his prisoners and spared them from an enraged population in Petrograd.

<doc id="1169634" wikidata="Q112084" url="?curid=1169634" title="Temù">
<text>Temù (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; of 1,113 inhabitants (As of 2016) in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy.

== Geography ==
It is situated on the river Oglio, in the upper Val Camonica. It is composed of two districts: Pontagna (1.164 m.) and Villa Dalegno (1.380 m.).

== Monuments and Attractions ==

=== Religious Architecture ===

Temù has three main churches:

*&quot;San Bartolomeo Apostolo&quot;: it was renovated in the 19th century and its structure dates back to the 16th century. The gate is made of marble from Vezza d&#x27;Oglio.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Alessandro&quot;: it is located in the street which goes to Vione. The structure dates back to the 16th century, but the bell tower dates back to the 13th century.
*&quot;Santi Martiri&quot;: it is situated in Lecanù and dates back to the 16th century.

== Culture ==

=== Museums ===
Temù hosts the Museo della Guerra Bianca in Adamello (Museum of the White War in Adamello).

== Economy ==

=== Tourism ===
Nowadays, despite the presence of beautiful natural resources which could attract tourists, the economy of Temù is based on the residential construction (secondary houses and residence) in relation to the activity of the ski area of Adamello Ski.

In summer tourism is underestimated compared to its richness in natural resources and local traditions, whereas the exploitation of the territory is excessive is winter due to winter sports, for example skiing. This is the main reason why the jobs are mostly seasonal.

== Administration ==

=== Mayors ===
=== Municipalities Union ===
Temù is part of the Unione dei Comuni dell&#x27;Alta Valle Camonica (&quot;Municipalities Union of High Val Camonica&quot;) together with Ponte di Legno, Vione, Vezza d&#x27;Oglio, Incudine and Monno. The Unione is based in Ponte di Legno and it was established in 2000. Its surface is 284,10 km².

=== Union with Ponte di Legno ===
On 28 October 2012 the municipality asked residents in a referendum about the union with Ponte di Legno, but the proposal has not been approved and the same happened in 2017.

More recently, he has developed Context-oriented programming, with Robert Hirschfeld.

His past involvements include specification and implementation of the languages Gilgul and Lava, and the design and application of the JMangler framework for load-time transformation of Java class files. He has also implemented ContextL, the first programming language extension for Context-oriented Programming based on CLOS, and aspect-oriented extensions for CLOS. He is furthermore the initiator and lead of Closer, an open source project that provides a compatibility layer for the CLOS MOP across multiple Common Lisp implementations. He has also co-organized numerous workshops on Unanticipated Software Evolution, Aspect-Oriented Programming, Object Technology for Ambient Intelligence, Lisp, and redefinition of computing. He has a Ph.D. degree from the University of Bonn, Germany.

Italy and Austria were the pioneers in organic farming and are today leading the field, with Austria having over 23% and Italy 15% organic agriculture . Slovenia has been gradually catching up since its independence in 1991. Its organic sector grew from being less than 0.1% of Slovenian agriculture in 1998, to reaching 10% , surpassing the European Union average of 7%.

<text>WBMA-LD (channel 58) is a low-power television station in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate WABM (channel 68) and Homewood-licensed CW affiliate WTTO (channel 21); Sinclair also operates Bessemer-licensed WDBB (channel 17), which serves as a full satellite station of WTTO, under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair partner company Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WDBB as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith.

WBMA-LD, WABM and WTTO share studios at the Riverchase office park on Concourse Parkway in Hoover (with a Birmingham mailing address); WBMA-LD&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Red Mountain (near the Tarpley City neighborhood) in southwestern Birmingham.

WBMA transmits a low-power signal, which even in digital effectively limits its over-the-air radius to Birmingham proper and nearby areas in Jefferson, Tuscaloosa, Walker, Bibb and Shelby counties. Because of this, the station&#x27;s programming is simulcast on the digital subchannels of three other Central Alabama stations that act as full-power relays—including those of WABM and WDBB—in order to reach the entire Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market.

The station&#x27;s brand name, &quot;ABC 33/40&quot;, is derived from the two stations that formerly operated as full-power satellites of WBMA to distribute its programming to southwestern and northeastern areas of central Alabama from the station&#x27;s acquisition of the ABC affiliation in September 1996 until October 2014, WCFT-TV (channel 33) in Tuscaloosa and WJSU-TV (channel 40) in Anniston, which now respectively operate as Heroes &amp; Icons affiliates WSES and WGWW (the latter of which simulcasts WBMA-LD on its second subchannel through a time brokerage agreement with Sinclair partner company and current owner of the two stations, Howard Stirk Holdings). The moniker remains in use largely due to its continued carriage over channel assignments originally given to its ex-satellites—and now assigned to its subchannel relays—on multichannel television providers throughout Central Alabama outside of Greater Birmingham (primarily non-cable-based services like the IPTV-based U-verse, and satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network).

==History==
===Early history and formation of trimulcast with WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV===
On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which would be renamed Citicasters following the completion of its debt restructuring later that year) agreed to sell Birmingham&#x27;s longtime ABC affiliate, WBRC-TV (channel 6), and three of its sister stations (fellow ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina, NBC affiliate WDAF-TV in Kansas City, and CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV in Phoenix) to New World Communications for $350 million in cash and $10 million in share warrants. As part of a broader deal between New World and the Fox Broadcasting Company signed on May 23 of that year, New World agreed to affiliate five of its eight existing television stations and the four it had acquired from Great American with Fox, in a series of affiliation transactions that would take two years to complete due to the varying conclusion dates of their ongoing contracts with either ABC, NBC or CBS. Three weeks later, New World agreed to buy NBC affiliate WVTM-TV (channel 13) and three other stations from Argyle Television Holdings (CBS affiliates KDFW in Dallas–Fort Worth and KTBC in Austin, and ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis), in a purchase option-structured deal worth $717 million. Due to conflicts with FCC ownership rules of the time period, New World subsequently decided to establish and transfer the licenses of WBRC and WGHP into a trust company, with the intent to sell them to the Fox network&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary, Fox Television Stations (in the case of Birmingham, New World could not keep WBRC and WVTM since the FCC then forbade a single company from owning two television stations in the same market; the concurrent Argyle and Citicasters acquisitions also put New World three stations over the FCC&#x27;s twelve-station ownership limit).

Although the sales of WBRC and WGHP were finalized on July 24, 1995, Fox Television Stations could not switch WBRC&#x27;s network affiliation in the short-term, as the station&#x27;s contract with ABC would not expire until August 31, 1996. While this forced Fox to operate WBRC as an ABC affiliate for thirteen months after the sale&#x27;s closure, it gave the latter network enough time to find a new central Alabama affiliate. ABC first approached WTTO (channel 21, now a CW affiliate) – which, along with semi-satellites WDBB (channel 17) in Tuscaloosa and WNAL-TV (channel 44, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXH-TV) in Gadsden, was set to lose its Fox affiliation to channel 6 – for a deal to replace WBRC as its Birmingham outlet. However, the owner of WTTO, Sinclair Broadcast Group, only expressed interest in carrying ABC&#x27;s prime time and news programming. It also refused to launch a news department for WTTO, as the group did not factor local news production into its corporate budget at the time (this was despite the fact that sister station WDBB had maintained a standalone news operation at the time ABC started negotiations with WTTO, which was eventually shut down when the former switched to a full-time WTTO simulcast in December 1995).

In November 1995, Allbritton Communications purchased CBS affiliate WCFT-TV (channel 33) in Tuscaloosa from Federal Broadcasting for $20 million; it concurrently signed a deal with Fant Broadcasting to assume operational responsibilities for WNAL-TV under a local marketing agreement. Then in January 1996, after it terminated the WNAL deal, Allbritton acquired the non-license assets of CBS affiliate WJSU-TV (channel 40) in Anniston from Osborne Communications Corporation for $12 million (through an LMA arrangement which included an option to eventually purchase the station outright). Allbritton wanted to relocate WJSU&#x27;s transmitter facilities closer to Birmingham to provide a stronger signal within that metropolitan area and nearby Tuscaloosa; however, the relocation was prohibited under FCC regulations that required a station&#x27;s transmitter site be located no more than from its city of license (Anniston is northeast of Birmingham), which would have required an application to change the city of license closer to Birmingham in order to legally allow the move.

Shortly after the WJSU purchase took place, ABC reached a unique deal with Allbritton, in which WCFT and WJSU would become the new ABC affiliates for Central Alabama, with WCFT acting as the main station. ABC had a very strong relationship with Allbritton, particularly as Allbritton&#x27;s flagship station, WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C., had long been one of ABC&#x27;s highest-rated affiliates. In April 1996, a few months after the Birmingham deal was struck, Allbritton&#x27;s ties to ABC were sealed wholesale when Allbritton reached a ten-year affiliation agreement with ABC that renewed contracts with the group&#x27;s five existing ABC affiliates (WJLA-TV, WSET-TV in Lynchburg, Virginia, KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas, KTUL in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and WHTM in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; WHTM was in the process of being acquired by Allbritton at the time of the deal) and resulted in two of its other stations switching to the network (NBC affiliate WCIV [now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WGWG] in Charleston, South Carolina, and WB affiliate WBSG-TV [now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXC-TV] in Brunswick, Georgia, the latter of which would become a satellite of WJXX in nearby Jacksonville, Florida, when Allbritton signed that station on in February 1997).

A key problem with the deal, however, was that under Nielsen rules, neither WCFT nor WJSU would likely be counted in the Birmingham ratings books as it had designated Tuscaloosa and Anniston as separate markets at the time. Allbritton&#x27;s solution to this issue was to purchase W58CK, a low-power independent station in Birmingham that began operations on November 18, 1994 (under the ownership of Shirley James), which would serve as the primary station for the purpose of being counted in local ratings diaries. While the purchase of channel 58 was not a condition of the deal between ABC and Allbritton, it did pave the way for Anniston and Tuscaloosa to be consolidated back into the Birmingham television market in September 1998 (at the start of the 1998–99 television season). That move benefited all of the major Birmingham stations, as it not only increased their viewership in Tuscaloosa and Anniston, but also resulted in Birmingham&#x27;s placement in Nielsen&#x27;s national market rankings jumping twelve spots from 51st to 39th place.

W58CK became an ABC affiliate on September 1, 1996, at which time WCFT and WJSU also ended separate operations and became full-powered satellite stations of W58CK, with Allbritton assuming control of WJSU&#x27;s operations under the originally proposed LMA, which was transferred to Flagship Broadcasting upon that company&#x27;s purchase of that station (Allbritton would eventually purchase WJSU-TV outright in 2008). The respective studio facilities of both stations – located near Skyland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa and on Noble Street in downtown Anniston – were converted into news bureaus, with their master control operations being migrated to W58CK&#x27;s new studios on Concourse Parkway in Hoover. WCFT and WJSU also ceded the CBS programming rights in central Alabama to WBMG (channel 42, now WIAT), which had recently upgraded its transmitter to provide a much stronger full-power signal throughout much of the Birmingham market, and WNAL-TV, which took over as CBS&#x27;s northeastern Alabama affiliate on the day of the WBRC/WBMA+/WTTO switch.

Even though WBMA was the official ABC affiliate for the Birmingham market, Allbritton chose to brand the combined operation as &quot;ABC 33/40&quot;, using the over-the-air channel numbers of WCFT and WJSU instead, making it appear as if WCFT was the primary station. The three stations&#x27; combined signal footprint covered the majority of Central Alabama (with the exception of certain areas to the immediate north and south of Jefferson County that could not receive a Grade B signal from W58CK/WBMA or the Tuscaloosa and Anniston satellites) and provided at least secondary coverage from the Alabama–Georgia state line westward to Columbus, Mississippi. Cable (and eventually, satellite) providers within the market usually picked up the signal of either WCFT or WJSU, both of which provided at least secondary coverage of Birmingham&#x27;s inner ring.

Its original slogan for its first ten years as an ABC affiliate was &quot;We&#x27;re [Always] Building Our Station Around You&quot;, which unlike most advertising catchphrases, was quite accurate; the station&#x27;s programming consultants surveyed a large number of central Alabama residents to literally build a new station from the ground up, catering to the interests of its potential viewers. At the time it joined the network, WCFT began serving as the default ABC affiliate for the Columbus–Tupelo market; this lasted until WKDH signed on as the market&#x27;s ABC station in 2001 (WKDH shut down in 2013 following the termination of a local marketing agreement with NBC affiliate WTVA, which took over the ABC affiliation on a digital subchannel). W58CK, which had been informally been using the WBMA calls from the time it began operations, officially changed its call letters to WBMA-LP on September 23, 1997.

In June 1998, ABC parent The Walt Disney Company entered into negotiations to purchase the eight Allbritton stations and the LMAs with WJSU and WJXX, reportedly offering the company more than $1 billion to acquire them (which if successful, would have made WBMA+ the Birmingham market&#x27;s third network-owned station, alongside WBRC and WVTM, which operated as an NBC O&amp;O from 1996 – when New World sold it to NBC Television Stations on May 22 of that year – until 2006, and Birmingham the smallest American television market with at least three major network O&amp;Os). Negotiations between Disney and Allbritton broke down when the former dropped out of discussions to buy the stations the following month.

Between May 26, 2008, and March 23, 2009, Nielsen Media Research mistakenly undercounted viewership for WBMA+ in its diary ratings tallies. Due to a &quot;procedural error&quot;, ratings for WBMA-LP, and WCFT and WJSU respectively (which were traditionally measured collectively as &quot;WBMA+&quot; due to the unique trimulcast structure) failed to properly measure viewership through the three stations&#x27; digital signals – the feeds that were also distributed to local cable and satellite providers – together and combine them with ratings counts for their analog signals, resulting in ratings for WBMA&#x27;s digital signal only being counted. The error significantly reduced the total viewership and ratings share estimates recorded to less than half of what station management expected. It was later explained that Nielsen had undercounted and overcounted the stations&#x27; viewership at various times between February 2008 and November 2009, as well as during a period in January 2010 that it had shortchanged WBMA+&#x27;s prime time ratings (including the registry of occasional zero shares for some ABC programs). The confusion stemmed from the station&#x27;s unique three-station simulcasting setup.

===Acquisition by Sinclair===
For over a decade and a half, WBMA+ maintained a strong relationship with Allbritton, with no major problems arising between the two entities and, likewise, no major changes occurring to the station&#x27;s operations. On July 29, 2013, Allbritton announced that it would sell its seven television stations, including WBMA+, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group (which would purchase the stations for $985 million), in an attempt by the company to shift its focus toward co-owned political news website, Politico. As part of the deal, Sinclair had intended to sell the license assets of its existing Birmingham stations, CW affiliate WTTO and MyNetworkTV affiliate WABM (channel 68) to Deerfield Media, and retain operational responsibilities for those stations through shared services and joint sales agreements. At the time, no affiliation changes were expected.

On December 6, 2013, the FCC informed Sinclair that applications related to the deal need to be &quot;amended or withdrawn,&quot; as Sinclair would retain an existing time brokerage agreement between WTTO and its satellite station, WDBB (channel 17); this would, in effect, create a new LMA between WBMA+ and WDBB, even though the Commission had ruled in 1999 that such agreements made after November 5, 1996, covering the programming of more than 15% of a station&#x27;s broadcast day would count toward the ownership limits for the brokering station&#x27;s owner. A sale of WBMA and its satellites to a separate buyer was also not an option for Sinclair, as Allbritton wanted its stations to be sold together to limit the tax rate that the company would have had to pay from the accrued proceeds, which it estimated would have been substantially higher if the group was sold piecemeal.

On March 20, 2014, as part of a restructuring of the Sinclair-Allbritton deal in order to address these ownership conflicts as well as to expedite the Allbritton acquisition because of them due to the FCC&#x27;s increased scrutiny of outsourcing agreements used to circumvent in-market ownership caps, Sinclair announced that it would retain ownership of WTTO (choosing to retain the LMA between that station and WDBB, and continue operating it as a satellite station of WTTO), and form a new duopoly between it and WBMA+; WABM was to be sold to a third-party buyer with which Sinclair would not enter into an operational outsourcing arrangement or maintain any contingent interest, other than a possible transitional shared facilities agreement until WTTO was able to move its operations from its longtime home on Beacon Parkway West to WBMA&#x27;s facility in Hoover.

On May 29, 2014, however, Sinclair informed the FCC that it had not found a buyer for WABM (even among the market&#x27;s three existing major station owners, WBRC owner Raycom Media, then-WVTM owner Media General and then-WIAT owner LIN Media, neither of which operated an existing duopoly station in the Birmingham market, although the latter two groups were in the process of merging at the time, with Media General eventually selling WVTM to Hearst Television) and proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT and WJSU to the agency. Under the restructured plan, WABM would become the main ABC affiliate for central Alabama, with WBMA-LD becoming its repeater. WABM&#x27;s existing programming would move to its second digital channel on 58.2 (WBMA-LD itself, as a low-power station, would not be affected as FCC rules allow the ownership of one or more low-power and up to two full-power stations regardless of market ownership caps for duopolies). Sinclair opted to retain WABM on the basis that its transmission facilities are superior to those of WCFT and WJSU; indeed, moving ABC programming to WABM would have given ABC a full-power affiliate in Birmingham itself for the first time since 1996. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair&#x27;s deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014, and was completed on August 1, 2014.

===Sale of WCFT and WJSU to Howard Stirk Holdings===
On September 18, 2014, in preparation for the planned shutdown of WCFT and WJSU eleven days later on September 29, WDBB and WABM added a simulcast feed of WBMA-LD on their respective second digital subchannels (17.2 and 68.2). WJSU officially signed off at 10:35 p.m. on September 29, 2014; in addition to being available on the second digital subchannels of WABM and WDBB, WCFT-TV continued to simulcast WBMA-LD on its main channel in the interim.

On September 24, 2014, Sinclair filed an application with the FCC to sell the license assets of WCFT to Howard Stirk Holdings (owned by conservative political commentator Armstrong Williams, who has ties to Sinclair as his political affairs program, &quot;The Right Side&quot;, airs on many of the group&#x27;s stations and is produced at the studios of its Baltimore flagship station WBFF) for $50,000, foregoing any operational agreements with the company for the station. Sinclair had reached a similar deal to sell WCIV in Charleston – another station that was set to be shut down as a result of a similar arrangement involving its MyNetworkTV affiliate in that market, WMMP, due to a grandfathered LMA that station maintained (and subsequently decided to terminate) with Fox affiliate WTAT – to the same company.

As a result of the WCFT/HSH deal, WCFT remained on the air past its scheduled September 29 sign-off date. In addition, as the sale of WJSU-TV in effect superseded the proposed surrender of its license, Sinclair requested that the FCC hold off on canceling the license until at least ten business days after acting on the proposed transaction. In order for Sinclair to continue operating WJSU and WCFT and maintain their existing licenses until the FCC ruled on the petition and the sale to HSH, the two stations began providing interim programming as affiliates of Heartland (which they both previously carried on their third digital subchannels as WBMA satellites) on October 20, 2014; at that time, WJSU was essentially converted into a satellite of WCFT. WBMA-LD&#x27;s main ABC programming and its &quot;James Spann 24/7 Weather&quot; channel were restored on WJSU&#x27;s second and third subchannels on December 3, 2014. The FCC approved the transfer of license of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV to Howard Stirk Holdings the following day on December 4.

Even though WGWW (the call letters assigned by Howard Stirk to the former WJSU-TV on March 11, 2015, at which time WCFT also changed its calls to WSES) is the only one of the two original satellites that continues to relay WBMA&#x27;s programming, the station continues to identify by &quot;ABC 33/40&quot; as an artifact brand as most central Alabamians still refer to WBMA+ by either that name or &quot;[channel] 33/40&quot;, as well as the fact that the station is carried on either channel on AT&amp;T U-verse, DirecTV and Dish Network in the market. With WDBB, WABM and WGWW relegating the station&#x27;s ABC programming to digital subchannels, WBMA-LD became the largest Big Four network affiliate by market size to rely on digital multicasting for full market distribution over-the-air (in addition to its existing status as the largest low-power Big Four affiliate overall), as well as making Birmingham one of the only U.S. television markets where all but one of the six major broadcast networks (in this case, CBS, NBC, Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV) maintain primary channel affiliations on full-power stations, while the remaining network (ABC) is only available through low-power and digital multicast affiliations (the latter status since been surpassed by WBTS-CD in Boston, when it became an NBC owned-and-operated station – the only Big Four O&amp;O originating on a low-power signal – in January 2017).

==Programming==
In September 2006, WBMA+ moved the popular soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from 10 a.m. (where the program had aired since channel 58 as well as the former WCFT and WJSU assumed the ABC affiliation in September 1996) to 12 p.m. From the time of its switch to ABC until the timeslot change, the station had aired &quot;All My Children&quot; on a day-behind delayed basis, in the continuation of a practice instituted by WBRC throughout its final 26 years as an ABC affiliate, starting with the soap opera&#x27;s premiere in 1970. The move to the noon timeslot marked the second time since &quot;All My Children&quot; debuted on ABC that the show had aired in pattern in the Birmingham market, having aired at 11:30 a.m. from July 1975 until the show expanded to an hour in 1977; &quot;The Chew&quot;, which replaced &quot;AMC&quot; after it ended its 41-year run in September 2011, also aired at noon until the show&#x27;s cancellation in June 2018.

On April 30, 1997, WBMA+ decided that it would not air &quot;The Puppy Episode&quot;, an episode of the ABC sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot; that gained notoriety for Ellen DeGeneres&#x27; character Ellen Morgan (and in effect, DeGeneres herself) coming out as a lesbian, after ABC declined a request by station management to air the episode on tape delay in a late-night timeslot. Jerry Heilman, then-general manager of the WBMA trimulcast, cited a need to respect the family values of the region&#x27;s largely conservative evangelical community as the basis of its decision. Some gay rights and civil libertarian activists decried the decision as a blatant example of censorship; in response, per a request by the LGBT organizations GLAAD and locally based Birmingham Pride Alabama, ABC downlinked a special satellite feed of the episode&#x27;s broadcast to the Boutwell Memorial Auditorium in downtown Birmingham that was viewed by about 1,000 people, mainly local gay and lesbian persons, and their supporters. Some area cable providers also carried the network feed of the episode by way of out-of-market ABC affiliates such as WSB-TV in Atlanta. WBMA+ would eventually air the episode when it was re-aired by the network later that same season.

===News operation===
, WBMA+ presently broadcasts 32 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition, the station produces the hour-long infotainment program &quot;Talk of Alabama&quot;, which airs weekday mornings at 9 a.m., and the half-hour sports highlight and discussion program &quot;The Zone&quot;, which airs on Sunday nights following the 10 p.m. newscast; since September 2015, a daily extension of the latter program has also aired on Monday through Thursday nights on WTTO/WDBB.

====News department history====
After the announcement that W58CK would become Birmingham&#x27;s ABC affiliate, then-owner Allbritton Communications agreed to invest in an in-house news department for the station. It moved the operations of W58CK, WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV into a new studio facility at the Riverchase complex near Hoover, a digital-capable building that was equipped with more than $2 million of Philips digital equipment for newsgathering and signal transmission. W58CK&#x27;s newly created news department effectively took over newscast production for WCFT and WJSU; the latter two stations concurrently discontinued their in-house newscasts (which had focused their news coverage on their respective cities of license, and surrounding areas near Tuscaloosa and Anniston) and shut down their separate news departments on August 31, 1996. Incidentally, one main reason that ABC approached WCFT and WJSU to become its new central Alabama affiliate was that both were the only remaining stations in the market with functioning news departments.

W58CK began airing regular long-form newscasts once it became an ABC affiliate the following day on September 1, beginning with that evening&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast; the station&#x27;s newscasts were originally branded as &quot;The (airtime) News on Alabama&#x27;s ABC 33/40&quot;, before eventually being shortened to the unified &quot;ABC 33/40 News&quot; in 2001. At that time, the station launched a full slate of local news programming – airing newscasts at 5:30 a.m., noon, 5, 6 and 10 p.m. on Monday through Fridays (the late newscast being then titled &quot;The Night Team on Alabama&#x27;s ABC 33/40&quot;), along with weekend evening newscasts. WCFT and WJSU began simulcasting its newscasts on that date, following their conversion into satellite stations of channel 58 as part of the &quot;ABC 33/40&quot; trimulcast operation.

W58CK maintained certain primary personnel from WCFT and WJSU&#x27;s news staffs that Allbritton had transferred from those stations to the new combined operation, including respected veteran WCFT anchor Dave Baird. (Baird served as co-anchor of the weeknight newscasts from the new station&#x27;s debut, until his retirement in 2017.) In addition, the station hired many well-known Birmingham television personalities to work as part of its news staff in the run-up to the department&#x27;s launch; among them were news anchors Brenda Ladun and Linda Mays, sports anchor Mike Raita, and meteorologists James Spann and Mark Prater, all of whom had previously worked at rival WBRC during the latter years of its ABC affiliation, and former WVTM-TV news personalities Pam Huff and Tracy Haynes, who were later hired to anchor the station&#x27;s morning newscasts. On September 11, 2006, the station moved its midday newscast to 11 a.m. and expanded it into an hour-long broadcast, as a result of the move of &quot;All My Children&quot; into the newscast&#x27;s former timeslot.

Although it is a recent entrant in the Birmingham ratings (even though WCFT and WJSU had already established news departments prior to becoming satellites of WBMA-LD), WBMA+&#x27;s newscasts have fared much better than those of other upstart news departments created following affiliation deals resulting from the Fox-New World agreement, especially considering WBMA+ is more dependent on cable and satellite than the market’s other major stations. Its news department quickly established itself as formidable competition to those of its rivals in the Birmingham market, differing from other stations that became Big Three affiliates resulting from affiliation switches spurred by Fox&#x27;s acquisition of the NFL rights. Many of these fledgling newscasts have continued to place last in the ratings to this day. The station spent much of the late 1990s and 2000s in a spirited battle with WVTM for second place in the market behind longtime leader WBRC. In recent years, WBMA+ has regularly traded the runner-up spot in the market with a resurgent WIAT after viewership for WVTM&#x27;s newscasts gradually dropped to fourth place following NBC&#x27;s 2006 sale of the station to Media General. Much of the early success it achieved with its newscasts was due to the hirings of well-known talent as well as its extensive coverage of severe weather events affecting its viewing area.

On January 31, 2010, WBMA+ became the third television news operation in the Birmingham-Tuscaloosa-Anniston market to begin broadcasting their local newscasts in high definition (after WVTM, which upgraded on October 17, 2007, and WBRC, which upgraded on October 26, 2009; WIAT upgraded to the format three months after WBMA+&#x27;s conversion, on April 9, 2010). On September 12, 2011, the station debuted an hour-long late-afternoon newscast, &quot;Focus @ 4:00&quot;, which replaced &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (which had been airing on WBMA+ from the assumption of the ABC affiliation until it ended its syndication run on September 9, three days prior to the newscast&#x27;s premiere).

====Weather coverage====
WBMA+ has placed a significant emphasis on weather in its news coverage and has become known throughout central Alabama for its comprehensive severe weather coverage led by chief meteorologist James Spann. A longtime veteran of Birmingham television, Spann joined WBMA+ in October 1996 after he chose to leave WBRC following disagreements with station management over Fox&#x27;s edgier programming. WBMA+ has maintained a long-standing policy to preempt regular programming and run wall-to-wall, uninterrupted severe weather coverage in the event that the National Weather Service Birmingham office issues a tornado warning for any county within its viewing area. The station operates &quot;StormChaser 33/40&quot;, a Jeep customized for storm chasing purposes, which is equipped with a dashcam and a computer programmed with software relaying data from several radar sources; and &quot;AirLink 33/40&quot;, a helicopter that is normally used for newsgathering, but is also occasionally used to show the paths of violent and long-track tornadoes.

WBMA+ also operates a network of &quot;SkyCam&quot; units throughout Alabama that provide live video as well as weather data from observation sites throughout the state, including downtown Birmingham, Tuscaloosa; Inverness, Gadsden, Jasper, Mount Cheaha, Cullman, Clanton, Gulf Shores, Hamilton, and Huntsville. It also operates a few SkyCam sites in Mississippi, including in Starkville and Columbus, based in locations that presently receive the station via WDBB-DT2 and previously received it through WCFT prior to September 2014. In the latter half of 2013, WBMA+ replaced many of its standard-definition-only SkyCam units with high-definition cameras, and additionally set up new HD SkyCams in the Riverchase Galleria complex (atop the Galleria Tower) in Hoover; atop the Alabama Power Headquarters Building in downtown Birmingham; atop DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa; and in several other locations around central Alabama.

Despite being a relatively new station to the Birmingham market, WBMA+ achieved notice among central Alabama viewers as it has captured of several of the most significant weather events in recent state history through both its SkyCams and its tower cameras. On April 27, 2011, the Cullman SkyCam caught footage of a multiple-vortex EF4 tornado that struck the city&#x27;s downtown area. Later that day, the SkyCam in Tuscaloosa (located atop the Tuscaloosa County Courthouse) captured footage of another EF4 tornado that produced incredible devastation across southeastern portions of that city. Footage of that same tornado as it tracked northeastward into western Jefferson County was captured by the Birmingham SkyCam (located atop the Daniel Building) as it passed through the northwestern suburbs of the city almost an hour later. On December 25, 2012, the Mobile SkyCam (located in Battleship Park) captured the faint image of an EF2 tornado as it struck that city after sunset. On August 31, 2017, the Reform SkyCam (located atop the town&#x27;s elementary school) captured an EF2 tornado that formed from the remnants of Hurricane Harvey.

Additionally, WBMA+ operates &quot;TowerLink&quot; cameras that are mounted on current and former transmitters of WBMA and its repeater stations, some of which have also played parts in the station&#x27;s storm coverage. The Birmingham TowerLink camera (located on WBMA-LD&#x27;s current tower) caught footage of a major power outage in western Birmingham, which indicated the presence of a destructive nighttime F5 tornado that hit the city on April 8, 1998. The Tuscaloosa TowerLink camera (then located on the old WCFT broadcast tower, which was dismantled in 2012) caught footage of an F4 tornado that hit southeastern Tuscaloosa in December 2000, an EF1 tornado near Buhl that spawned from Hurricane Rita in September 2005, and an EF3 tornado that struck southern Tuscaloosa on April 15, 2011. A TowerLink camera is also located on WGWW&#x27;s transmitter tower in Anniston (it is the only TowerLink camera that has not captured any tornadoes live on-air).

====Social media====
WBMA+ relies heavily on social media, especially for the dissemination of weather updates, and alerts during severe thunderstorm and winter weather events. The station maintains both a Facebook page and a Twitter feed (as do several members of the station&#x27;s on-air news staff) which are used to update viewers on local news headlines and weather alerts, as well as to receive feedback from viewers on news stories. Chief meteorologist James Spann has stated that social media makes it easier to warn the public of impending severe weather. Facebook and Twitter were also used in the weeks following the April 27, 2011, tornado outbreak to report – among other things – damage, missing persons and effects of the storm on the people of Alabama. WBMA+ also uses Flickr to post viewer-submitted weather photos, or pictures of severe weather damage. This strong reliance on social media prompted the station to develop an hour-long newscast with Facebook interaction as its basis, &quot;Focus @ 4:00&quot;, which incorporates viewer responses on stories featured on the program through questions about current events and interesting topics through Facebook and vice versa. The show also helped increase viewership for WBMA+ in the 4 p.m. timeslot, due to it being the only local newscast airing at that hour in the Birmingham market.

====Notable current on-air staff====
* James Spann (AMS Certified Broadcast Meteorologist Seal of Approval) – chief meteorologist; weeknights

====Notable former on-air staff====
* John Oldshue – meteorologist (1997–2007; left to operate a small business)

== Technical information ==
=== Subchannels ===

The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
=== Satellites ===

To extended WBMA-LD&#x27;s reach beyond Birmingham proper, the station is rebroadcast over subchannels of the three full-service television station licenses:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Although WBMA-LP was not obligated to shut off its analog signal, as the law exempted low-power stations from the national transition from analog to digital television broadcasts, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) encouraged low-power television stations to vacate from high-band UHF channels 52 to 69, as these out-of-core allotments were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the conversion.

On December 3, 2010, the FCC granted WBMA-LP a construction permit to flash-cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 40 (formerly occupied by the analog signal of WJSU) and shut down the analog signal. WBMA-LP had a permit to operate on VHF channel 11, but due to possible interference with fellow ABC affiliates WTVM in Columbus, Georgia, and WTOK-TV in Meridian, Mississippi (the latter of which transmits on its former analog frequency), the station decided to modify the application to transmit the signal on UHF channel 40. WBMA-LP signed on its low-power digital signal in late May 2011, under the call letters WBMA-LD; digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 58.

<text>The Fort Hall Reservation is a Native American reservation of the federally recognized [[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock people|Bannock]] Tribes (Shoshoni language: Pohoko’ikkatee) in the U.S. state of Idaho. This is one of five federally recognized tribes in the state. The reservation is located in southeastern Idaho on the Snake River Plain about north and west of Pocatello. It comprises of land area in four counties: Bingham, Power, Bannock, and Caribou. To the east is the Portneuf Range; both Mount Putnam and South Putnam Mountain are located on the Fort Hall Reservation.

Founded under an 1868 treaty, the reservation is named for Fort Hall, a trading post in the Portneuf Valley that was established by European Americans. It was an important stop along the Oregon and California Trails in the middle 19th century.

A monument on the reservation marks the former site of the fort. Interstate 15 serves the community of Fort Hall, the largest population center on the reservation. The total population of the reservation was 5,762 at the 2000 census. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes has more than 5,300 enrolled members, and more than half reside on the Fort Hall Reservation. Others have moved to urban areas for work. The tribes are governed by a seven-member elected council and maintain their own governmental services, including law enforcement, courts, social and health services, and education.

The four other federally recognized tribes in the state are the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Kootenai, Nez Perce, and Shoshone-Paiute at Duck Valley Indian Reservation.

In July 2016, the Department of Interior made offers to 536 landowners with fractional interests at Fort Hall Reservation for buy-back of lands valued at $11 million in offers. This was under its Land Buy-Back Program as part of the government&#x27;s settlement of the &quot;Cobell v. Salazar&quot; class action suit. The land purchased will be transferred into trust for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, to restore its traditional land. About 1.5 million acres of land has been put into trust for tribes under this program.

==History==

The Shoshone and Bannock had long occupied the territory of Idaho and nearby areas. They were not disrupted by settlers until the late 1840s and 1850s, when emigrant wagon trains increasingly crossed their territory which put strain on food and water resources, disrupting the way of life for the Shoshone and Bannock.

In the 1850s the Shoshone, led by Chief Pocatello, attacked emigrant parties in an effort to drive them off, as the settlers encroached on their hunting grounds and game. After initial hostilities, the Mormons, led by Brigham Young, pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Shoshone.

But other settlers complained, and the federal government ordered the U.S. Army into the Utah Territory in 1858, resulting in full-scale conflict between the U.S. and the Shoshone. There had been escalating conflicts, with the Shoshone and Bannock tribes pitted against the increasing tide of European-American settlers. The latter encroached on the Native Americans&#x27; traditional territory, competing for resources and damaging the habitat of game they depended on.

In January 1863 Colonel Patrick Edward Connor led his troops from Fort Douglas to chastise the Shoshone. In what is known as the Bear River massacre (1863), his US Army forces killed more than 400 Shoshone, including women and children, in present-day southeastern Idaho.

Warned of Connor&#x27;s advance, Pocatello had led his people out of harm&#x27;s way. Another chief and his band were attacked and largely destroyed.

Seeing the power of US forces, Pocatello subsequently sued for peace and agreed to relocate his people in 1868 to a newly established reservation along the Snake River. Four bands of Shoshone and the Bannock band of the Northern Paiute relocated to the reservation, then consisting of of land. As part of the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868, the U.S. government agreed to supply the Shoshone-Bannock tribes annually with goods and supplies annuities worth 5,000 dollars.

The U.S. government often failed to provide the annuity goods on time, and food supplies sometimes arrived spoiled. In addition, the lands of the reservation, located on the Snake River Plain, were not appropriate for the subsistence-type agriculture that the government wanted the Shoshone-Bannock to adopt. In the years following their removal to the reservation, the Shoshone-Bannock peoples suffered severely from hunger and disease, with high mortality. Hoping to relieve his people&#x27;s suffering, Pocatello led a small group to a missionary farm in the Utah Territory to receive mass baptism and conversion to Mormonism. Although the Shoshone were baptized, the local settlers, primarily Mormon, agitated for removal of the Indians. The U.S. Army forced the Shoshone back onto the reservation.

From 1868 to 1932, the federal government reduced the territory of the reservation by two-thirds, taking some for such projects as railroads and roads, and allowing non-Native settlers to encroach on the grounds. Most importantly, under the Dawes Act of 1887, the government attempted to impose the model of private property and subsistence farming, thinking to encourage assimilation of the tribes to the majority type farm. It registered all members of the tribes and allotted individual 160-acre plots of land to each household. Given the arid local conditions, these allotments were generally too small to support subsistence agriculture. The government declared the remainder of the formerly communal land to be &quot;surplus&quot; and sold much of it to European-American settlers. Some members of the tribes later sold their plots because they were too small to be successfully farmed, leading to the tribes&#x27; losing control of more lands.

==20th century to present==
In 1934 during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the US Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, created in part to end the allotment process and encourage tribes to re-establish self-government and to stabilize their land bases. In 1936 these two tribes reorganized, wrote a common constitution and established their own elected government. They have managed to retain most of their lands since that time.

During World War II, however, the US government assumed control of a 3,300-acre tract within the reservation, which it developed for use as an air base. Federal officials had told the tribe they would return the land to them after the war.

Instead, the federal government sold the property for $1 to nearby Pocatello, a city about to the east, which developed it as a regional airport. In the 21st century, there continue to be conflicts over development at the airport without consultation with the tribe. (See material below).

FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant under a lease at the Fort Hall Reservation. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. It has had serious adverse environmental effects. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations, including degradation of the Portneuf River. The J.R. Simplot Company also operated on and near the reservation for decades. Their sites have been designated by the EPA as Superfund sites. Although some mitigation has been accomplished, scientists estimate the pollution will be hazardous for a very long time.

As a result of this case, EPA has worked with the Tribes to develop the Clean Air Act’s Tribal Authority Rule, to provide tribes with more control over enforcement of clean air quality. The company abandoned the plant and related mine, due in large part to increased costs of electricity and competition from cheaper Chinese phosphate. Seventeen mines in the region have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning. Since 2001, FMC has been working on cleanup at the reservation. The tribe has developed its own expertise in air, water and land quality, but its resources are still seriously threatened by the extensive cleanup needed.

The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes chose to participate in the Department of Interior&#x27;s Native Nations Land Buy-Back Program, established after 2009 as part of the government&#x27;s settlement of the &quot;Cobell v. Salazar&quot; class action suit over mismanagement of fee/lease accounts. Under this program, the government is buying back fractional interests in lands within reservations to put the land into trust for the communal use of the tribes. It is an effort to restore some of the lands lost following the 19th century allotment process and reduce fractional holdings too small to use readily.

In July 2016, the Department of Interior made offers to 536 landowners with fractional interests at Fort Hall Reservation for buy-back of lands valued at $11 million. In total by July 2016, the Department of Interior had put about 1.5 million acres of land into trust for tribes under this program.

Relations with the city of Pocatello became strained in April 2016 after the tribes learned that the city had contracted with Pocatello Solar, based in Boise, to lease a new property at the airport. The tribe was consulted by FAA officials, who are handling the environmental assessment for the project, but they learned that the company was prohibited by the city from entering into any written agreement with the tribes. They are worried about getting stuck with an operation that could cause environmental damage.

==Economy ==

In the 21st century, the tribes employ nearly 1,000 Native and non-Native people in various trades: 575 in tribal government, 85 by the enterprises, and more than 300 in gaming. Since the late 20th century, the Tribes have developed the Fort Hall Casino and two smaller satellite casinos on the reservation. They are all operated by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, who use the revenues for additional economic development and to support education and healthcare for the people. The combined payroll of the various activities is more than $32 million. The tribal government is building the economy and ensuring the protection and enhancement of the reservation landbase for generations to come.

The main agricultural crops are wheat and potatoes, with the value of crops produced on the reservation exceeding $75 million annually.

<doc id="1169649" wikidata="Q91346" url="?curid=1169649" title="Hans von Storch">
<text>Hans von Storch (born 13 August 1949) is a German climate scientist. He is a professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg, and (since 2001) Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre (previously: GKSS Research Center) in Geesthacht, Germany. He is a member of the advisory boards of the journal &quot;Journal of Climate&quot;. He worked at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology from 1986 to 1995 and headed the Statistical Analysis and Modelling research group there.

==Opinion on global warming==
Storch said in testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 that anthropogenic climate change exists:

:&quot;Based on the scientific evidence, I am convinced that we are facing anthropogenic climate change brought about by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.&quot;

He is also known for an article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; he co-wrote with Nico Stehr, which states that:
:&quot;Scientific research faces a crisis because its public figures are overselling the issues to gain attention in a hotly contested market for newsworthy information.&quot;

:&quot;The alarmists think that climate change is something extremely dangerous, extremely bad and that overselling a little bit, if it serves a good purpose, is not that bad.&quot;

In December 2009, he expressed concern about the credibility of science and criticized some publicly visible scientists for simplifying and dramatizing their communications. He pointed to the German &quot;Waldsterben&quot; (Forest dieback) hype of the 1980s:
:Research about the forest die back in Germany may serve as an example at the other end of the spectrum. The science of forest damages was in the 1980s heavily politicized, and used as support for a specific preconceived &quot;good&quot; policy of environmental protection. The resulting overselling and dramatization broke down in the 1990s, and news about adverse developments in German forests is now a hard sell in Germany. An observer wrote in 2004: &quot;The damage for the scientists is enormous. Nobody believes them any longer.&quot; Of course, the damage was not only limited to the forest researchers, but also to other environmental scientists and politicians as well.

On 20 June 2013 Storch stated &quot;So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We&#x27;re facing a puzzle. Recent emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn&#x27;t happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) -- a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year.&quot;

==Climategate controversy==
Hans von Storch, who also concurs with the mainstream view on global warming, said that the University of East Anglia (UEA) had &quot;violated a fundamental principle of science&quot; by refusing to share data with other researchers. &quot;They play science as a power game,&quot; he said.

==&quot;Climate Research&quot; controversy==

In 2003, with effect from 1 August, Hans von Storch was appointed as editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Climate Research&quot;, after having been on its editorial board since 1994. A few months before a controversial article (Soon and Baliunas 2003) had raised questions about the journal&#x27;s decentralised review process, with no editor-in-chief, and about the editorial policy of one editor, Chris de Freitas. Storch drafted and circulated an editorial on the new regime, reserving the right as editor-in-chief to reject articles proposed for acceptance by one of the editors. Following the publisher&#x27;s refusal to publish the editorial unless all editors serving on the board endorsed the new policy, Storch resigned four days before he was due to take up his new position. Four other editors later left the journal. Storch later told the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; that &quot;climate science skeptics&quot; “had identified Climate Research as a journal where some editors were not as rigorous in the review process as is otherwise common.”

==Publications and awards==
In late 2004, Storch&#x27;s team published an article in the journal &quot;Science&quot; which tested multiproxy methods such as those used by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes, 1998, often called MBH98, or Mann and Jones, to obtain the global temperature variations in the past 1000 years. The test suggested that the method used in MBH98 would inherently underestimate large variations had they occurred; but this was subsequently challenged: see hockey stick graph for more detail.

To reach this conclusion, Storch et al. used a climate model to generate a series of annual temperature maps for the world over the past several centuries. They then added white noise to the proxy data and applied the methods used in MBH98, a variation of principal component analysis, to the computed temperature maps and found that the amount of variation was considerably reduced.

In April 2006, &quot;Science&quot; published a comment authored by Wahl and collaborators, asserting errors in the 2004 paper, stating that &quot;their conclusion was based on incorrect implementation of the reconstruction procedure&quot; a mistake with Repercussions; and a disputing VS Reply. In this reply, VS and his team demonstrated that caveats raised in the Wahl comment did not invalidate their original conclusion. The inadequacy of the MBH98 methodology for climate reconstructions was later independently confirmed in other publications, for instance by Lee, Zwiers and Tsao, 2008 or by Christiansen et al., 2009.

In 2010, Storch received the IMSC achievement award at the International Meetings on Statistical Climatology in Edinburgh, to &quot;recognize his key contributions to statistical downscaling, reconstruction of temperature series, analyses of climatic variability, and detection and attribution of climate change&quot;.

==Donald Duck==

In 1977, Hans von Storch co-founded a 100-member Donald Duck Club, defending Donald Duck against accusations of indecent behavior. Between 1976 and 1985 he was publisher of a magazine on Donald Duck, &quot;Der Hamburger Donaldist&quot;.

<text>The Newfoundland Railway was a narrow-gauge railway that operated on the island of Newfoundland from 1898 to 1988. With a total track length of , it was the longest narrow-gauge system in North America.

==History==

===Early construction===
In 1880, a committee of the Newfoundland Legislature recommended that a narrow-gauge railway be built from the colonial capital in St. John&#x27;s to Halls Bay, to the west. Construction was started on the Avalon Peninsula in August 1881 by the Blackman Syndicate. By 1884, the Newfoundland Railway Company had built west to Whitbourne before going into receivership.

The bondholders of the bankrupt Newfoundland Railway Company continued to build a branch line from Brigus Junction to Harbour Grace (the Harbour Grace Railway), which was completed by November that year.

The colonial government undertook to build a branch from the junction at Whitbourne to the port of Placentia between 1886 and 1888.

===Robert G. Reid===
The colonial government sought new investors to continue the stalled project to Halls Bay and in June 1890, Scottish-born Montreal resident and railway engineer/contractor Robert Gillespie Reid agreed to build and operate the line. By 1892, Reid&#x27;s workers were approaching the halfway point at the Exploits River when the government changed the terminus from Halls Bay approximately further west, first to St. George&#x27;s and finally to Port aux Basques. The route itself was diverted inland up the Exploits valley and over the Gaff Topsails (some of the highest elevation terrain on the island) and away from the coast once on the north bank of the Exploits River. This extension to the system was initially operated as the Newfoundland Northern and Western Railway and for it, Reid was granted land totalling .

The new line west to Port aux Basques was completed between 1894 and 1898. At the same time, Reid proposed a ferry service across the Cabot Strait from Port aux Basques to North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and contracted for a steamship to be built in Scotland. The &quot;Bruce&quot; arrived in the fall of 1897, before the line was completed to Port aux Basques, so her initial runs to Cape Breton Island were made from Little Placentia Sound. On June 29, 1898, the first passenger train arrived at Port aux Basques and the &quot;Bruce&quot; set sail with passengers for North Sydney.

Later that year, the colonial government persuaded Reid&#x27;s company to take over operation of the bankrupt Newfoundland Railway Company and its sister Harbour Grace Railway, as well as the government-owned Placentia branch, in order to unify the system across the entire island (known as the &quot;Railway Contract of &#x27;98&quot;). The Reid company agreed to operate the lines for 50 years, in exchange for outright ownership and land grants. They also purchased the government drydock in St. John&#x27;s and the telegraph system. The Reid company purchased eight new steamships to operate as coastal ferries around the island and into Labrador.

Controversy followed the awarding of so many assets to Reid, and in 1901 the contracts were modified to place everything under a limited liability corporation, named the Reid Newfoundland Company.

Reid&#x27;s railway development in the colony began to attract attention to the potential of the island&#x27;s natural resources. In 1903, the Reids partnered with a St. John&#x27;s businessman, Harry J. Crowe, to purchase timber rights in Botwood, Norris Arm, Gambo, Gander Bay, and Point Leamington. In 1904, British investors named Harmsworth declared their intention to build a pulp and paper mill in Grand Falls and on January 7, 1905, the Anglo Newfoundland Development Company (AND) was formed, based on a partnership between the Harmsworths, Reid and the colonial government. Botwood was expanded through the construction of deepwater wharves and warehouses for shipping the finished pulp. To link the two, AND built the narrow gauge Botwood Railway (built to the same gauge as the Reid Newfoundland Company trackage) beginning in 1908 and completing it in 1909. It would later be renamed the Grand Falls Central Railway.

Reid died in 1908 but his company set the pace for development in Newfoundland&#x27;s interior mining and forestry industries, although the entire operation continued to suffer losses. In 1909 and into the 1910s, the colonial government contracted for additional branch lines to be built. Some of the major works included:
* a line to Bonavista
* a line to Trepassey
* extend the Harbour Grace line through Carbonear to Bay de Verde
* several smaller branches, some of which were graded but rails were never installed

===Nationalization===
By the early 1920s, the Reid Newfoundland Company&#x27;s losses were mounting and in 1923 the colonial government passed the &quot;Railway Settlement Act&quot; which cancelled the operating contract for the entire system, passing the railway into government control (a form of nationalization). Some of the lands that had belonged to the Reid Newfoundland Company were used by the government as part of a deal to develop a pulp and paper mill in Corner Brook.

The railway was initially called the Newfoundland Government Railway but was soon shortened to the Newfoundland Railway in 1926. It remained the property of the dominion government until Confederation on March 31, 1949, when it was transferred to the federal government&#x27;s Canadian National Railway.

In 1925, the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) perfected a method for recovering individual metals in ore and entered into partnership with AND to develop a mine at Buchans, which was connected to the Newfoundland Railway by the Millertown Railway, also a narrow gauge.

===Wartime===
Although the railway saw an increase in traffic during the First World War, it was extensive military-related construction in the late 1930s and early 1940s which proved the worth of the Newfoundland Railway as a strategic asset. An air force base was developed adjacent to the main line in Gander, and major American military bases were constructed in Stephenville (Ernest Harmon AFB), Argentia (NS Argentia) and St. John&#x27;s (Pepperrell AFB), in addition to Canadian and British defence facilities in St. John&#x27;s. Given the lack of roads and all-weather highways in Newfoundland during the 1940s, and the U-boat threat in the waters off-shore, the Newfoundland Railway became a vital, yet very obscure, supply link in the defence of the Northeast Atlantic and the Allied convoy system.

When Winston Churchill met Franklin D. Roosevelt in Placentia Bay in 1941 to sign the Atlantic Charter, Churchill sent for Lord Beaverbrook, Minister of Aircraft Production. Beaverbrook flew into Gander and then travelled by rail to Placentia in the caboose of a freight train to save waiting for a passenger train.

In 1943, a joint project between AT&amp;T and the United States Army established strategic landline telephone service along the railroad right-of-way.

The Second World War also saw the Newfoundland Railway experience its most tragic loss, when the ferry &quot;Caribou&quot; was torpedoed and sunk off Port aux Basques by the on October 14, 1942. 137 passengers died and 104 people survived the sinking. In honour of the lost passengers and crew, the Newfoundland Railway Employees Association had the entire workforce forego a day&#x27;s wages as a donation to a public campaign to build a memorial near the Port aux Basques railway terminal.

===Canadian National===

Newfoundland became the 10th province of Canada on March 31, 1949, and the Newfoundland Railway&#x27;s assets were transferred to the control of the federal Crown corporation Canadian National Railway (CNR, CN post-1960). CN became a major presence in Newfoundland&#x27;s early years as a province, controlling the railway, dry dock services, many ferries and coastal boats, and the telegraph system.

The Newfoundland Railway&#x27;s premiere cross-island passenger train, &quot;The Overland Limited&quot; was renamed the &quot;Caribou&quot; by CN, although it was known colloquially as &quot;The Newfie Bullet&quot;. CN maintained the Caribou until 1969.

CN made major capital improvements, upgrading the main line, bridges, and rolling stock, and replacing steam locomotives with diesel units. Additional improvements were made to the ferry service, with new vessels and an expanded terminal at Port aux Basques. An additional indirect service improvement to the Newfoundland railway operations was made in 1955, with the opening of the Canso Causeway, linking Cape Breton Island with mainland North America and removing the need to ferry railcars destined for Newfoundland across the Strait of Canso.

CN&#x27;s Newfoundland operations continued to see significant traffic increases with its improved ferry and rail connections, but faced increased truck and bus competition on completion of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island in 1965. New railcar-capable ferries were introduced; mainland standard-gauge railcars were ferried to Newfoundland, where their standard-gauge bogies were replaced with narrow-gauge bogies in Port aux Basques. This innovation was unsuccessful. The first casualty was the passenger rail service, which was abandoned in 1969 in favour of buses. CN began to essentially stop marketing its own Newfoundland rail operations through the 1970s and began to rely on trucks for hauling cargo.

In 1979, CN reorganized its narrow-gauge system into Terra Transport, as a means to separate the subsidy-dependent Newfoundland rail operations from its mainland North America core freight rail system. Rail cargo traffic continued to decline, and all branch lines on the island were closed in 1984. In 1987, Canada deregulated its railway industry, allowing abandonments to proceed with less red tape. The former CN subsidiary CN Marine was reorganized into Marine Atlantic in 1986 and one of the two railcar ferries was sold off, leaving the narrow-gauge system with limited interchange ability at Port aux Basques in its final two years. In December 1987 the provincial and federal governments signed a deal worth $800 million for highway improvements, removing the provincial government&#x27;s opposition to the pending abandonment of the railway.

The railway was officially abandoned on October 1, 1988. Following abandonment, work trains continued to operate, assisting salvage crews to remove the rails from remote locations, particularly in the Gaff Topsails between the Exploits River and Deer Lake. The last train, prior to work trains removing rails, arrived from Port Aux Basques and departed Corner Brook eastbound on September 30 and arrived at Bishops Falls on the morning of October 1.

CN continued to operate its Roadcruiser Bus service and a CN Intermodal trucking operation in Newfoundland until 1996. With CN&#x27;s privatization in late 1995, the company divested itself of all money-losing and most non-railroad interests, including CN Roadcruiser. Cross-island bus service was taken over by DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland on March 30, 1996. The CN Newfoundland trucking operation continued until fall 1996, and was then contracted to Clarke Transport.

===Legacy===
The former Newfoundland Railway station in St. John&#x27;s now hosts the Railway Coastal Museum. Numerous towns across the island have preserved railway equipment on display.

With few exceptions, the roadbed now forms the T&#x27;Railway Provincial Park rail trail. Until 2005, the Trinity Loop Amusement Park operated a miniature train, one of the few remaining places on Newfoundland with tracks still in place. The park closed down and was abandoned in 2005 due to lack of interest. Since then, all of the buildings have been heavily vandalized and Hurricane Igor washed away part of the park, including a large section of the rail bed. Local railway fans have been pushing government to retain the park as an historic site but officials have expressed little interest.

Some rolling stock was converted to a narrower gauge of and sold to the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route (WP&amp;YR) railway, which reopened for service in 1988. Gravel cars used by WP&amp;YR are still painted in CN orange.

The province of Newfoundland and Labrador still has railway transportation, operating on mainland Labrador. The Quebec, North Shore &amp; Labrador Railway (QNSL) operates between Sept-Îles, Quebec, and the mining region of Labrador West. A former QNSL line, now owned and operated by Tshiuetin Rail Transportation, serves the former mining town of Schefferville, Quebec, passing through Labrador. QNSL also connects with Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s other active railway, the Wabush Lake Railway.

== Locomotives ==

In addition, the Steam Rail Coaches &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; were built between 1923 and 1925 by Sentinel-Cammell for the Newfoundland Railway for service between Humbermouth and Curling West, St. John&#x27;s and Topsail, and also on branch lines. Although successful in Britain, the type proved inadequate in the rugged winter weather of Newfoundland. Also, the necessity for a crew of three (engineer, fireman and conductor) meant that cost savings were not as great as expected. All were scrapped in 1938-39 after the closure of the Bay de Verde, Heart&#x27;s Content and Trepassy branches.

<text>Bitemporal hemianopsia is the medical description of a type of partial blindness where vision is missing in the outer half of both the right and left visual field. It is usually associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, the area where the optic nerves from the right and left eyes cross near the pituitary gland.

==Causes==
In bitemporal hemianopsia, vision is missing in the outer (temporal or lateral) half of both the right and left visual fields. Information from the temporal visual field falls on the nasal (medial) retina. The nasal retina is responsible for carrying the information along the optic nerve, and crosses to the other side at the optic chiasm. When there is compression at the optic chiasm, the visual impulse from both nasal retina are affected, leading to inability to see the temporal, or peripheral, field of vision. This phenomenon is known as bitemporal hemianopsia. Knowing the neurocircuitry of visual signal flow through the optic tract is very important in understanding bitemporal hemianopsia.

Bitemporal hemianopsia most commonly occurs as a result of tumors located at the mid-optic chiasm. Since the adjacent structure is the pituitary gland, some common tumors causing compression are pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas. Also, another relatively common neoplastic cause is meningiomas. A cause of vascular origin is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery which arises superior to the chiasm, enlarges, and compresses it from above.

==Etymology==
The absence of vision in half of a visual field is described as &quot;hemianopsia&quot;.

The visual field of each eye can be divided in two vertically, with the outer half being described as &quot;temporal&quot;, and the inner half being described as &quot;nasal&quot;.

&quot;Bitemporal hemianopsia&quot; can be broken down as follows:
* &quot;bi-&quot;: involves both left and right visual fields
* &quot;temporal&quot;: involves the temporal visual field
* &quot;hemi-&quot;: involves half of each visual field
* &quot;anopsia&quot;: blindness (formed by &quot;a(n) no + opsis vision + ia&quot;)

<doc id="1169694" wikidata="Q2157138" url="?curid=1169694" title="South Australian cobbler">
<text>The South Australian cobbler (Gymnapistes marmoratus), better known as the soldier but also known as the cobbler, devilfish or soldierfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a waspfish, belonging to the subfamily Tetraroginae which is classified within the family Scorpaenidae, the scorpionfishes and their relatives. It is endemic to southern Australia. It is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Gymnapistes&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The South Australian cobbler was first formally described in 1829 as &quot;Apistus marmoratus&quot; by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier with the type locality given as &quot;Timor Island, southern Malay Archipelago&quot;, although this is likely to be an error and the actual locality is in Western Australia. In 1839 the English zoologist William Swainson placed it in the new genus &quot;Gymnapistes&quot;, as its only species. This taxon is included in the subfamily Tetraroginae within the Scorpaenidae in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; however other authorities place that subfamily within the stonefish family Synanceiidae, while other authorities classify this subfamily as a family in its own right. The genus name is a compound of &quot;gymnos&quot; which means &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;naked&quot; with &quot;Apistes&quot;, this was originally proposed as a subgenus of &quot;Apistus&quot; and the first part alludes to the mostly scaleless body of this taxon. The specific name &quot;marmoratus&quot; means &quot;marbled&quot; as in alcohol this fish has a marbled appearance.

==Description==
The South Australian cobbler has a long based dorsal fin which has 12 or 13 spines, each separated by an incision in the membrane between them, and between 7 and 10 soft rays, the spiny and soft-rayed parts are separated by an incision, with 3 spines and 4 to 6 soft rays in its anal fin. It eye does not bulge above the dorsal profile of the head, the intraorbital space is slightly concave and there are several obvious spines on the head. The lacrimal bone is mobile and has a sizeable, curved, erectile spine to its posterior and a smaller anterior spine. The only scales are on the lateral line. This fish has a mottled pattern made up of brown to dark brown blotches on the upper body fading to pale ventrally. These blotches are less obvious in the larger fish. There is an obvious dark blotch on the dorsal fin between the 4th and 7th spines. There is a dark, oblong spot near the base on the pectoral fin while the other fins often have vermiculations or vague spotting. This species attains a maximum total length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
The South Australian cobbler is endemic to the temperate southern coasts of Australia. Its distribution extends from the central coast of New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia. It is found in shallow inshore waters, tidal pools and estuaries at depths between in beds of seagrass.

==Biology==
The South Australian cobbler is a nocturnal ambush predator, with the smaller fish feeding mainly on shrimp and small crabs and the larger fish being more piscivorous. It stays motionless during the day. These fishes attain sexual maturity at 2 to 4 years old. The adults leave the seagrass beds in the late winter and early spring, congregating in deeper water in very large aggregations, thought to be spawning aggregations. It is a slow-growing species and large individuals are much older in comparison to other species at the same size. They can live for more than 14 years. The adults have venom-bearing spines on the infraorbital bone, preopercular bone and in the dorsal, anal and pectoral fins.

==Utilisation==
The South Australian cobbler is taken as bycatch in both commercial and recreational fisheries.

==Venom==
The South Australian cobbler is well defended with venomous spines on the head and in the fins. People who have been envenomated by this fish rarely die, symptoms of envenomation include severe pain around the envenomated area of the body, swelling, nausea, perspiration, paralysis of the limbs and fainting. In worst cases the venom may interfere with the functioning of cardiovascular system.

<text>Edwidge Danticat (; born January 19, 1969) is a Haitian American novelist and short story writer. Her first novel, &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot;, was published in 1994 and went on to become an Oprah&#x27;s Book Club selection. Danticat has since written or edited several books and has been the recipient of many awards and honors. Her work has dealt with themes of national identity, mother-daughter relationships, and diasporic politics. In 2023, she was named the Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Professor of the Humanities in the department of African American and African Diaspora Studies at Columbia University.

==Early life==
Danticat was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. When she was 12 years old, her father André immigrated to New York, to be followed two years later by her mother Rose. This left Danticat and her younger brother, also named André, to be raised by her aunt and uncle. When asked in an interview about her traditions as a child, she included storytelling, church, and constantly studying school material as all part of growing up. Although her formal education in Haiti was in French, she spoke Haitian Creole at home.

While still in Haiti, Danticat began writing at nine years of age. She later wrote another story about her immigration experience for the magazine &quot;New Youth Connections&quot;, &quot;A New World Full of Strangers&quot;. In the introduction to &quot;Starting With I&quot;, an anthology of stories from the magazine, Danticat wrote: &quot;When I was done with the [immigration] piece, I felt that my story was unfinished, so I wrote a short story, which later became a book, my first novel: &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot;...Writing for &quot;New Youth Connections&quot; had given me a voice. My silence was destroyed completely, indefinitely.&quot;

After graduating from Clara Barton High School in Brooklyn, New York, Danticat entered Barnard College in New York City where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1990. Initially she had intended to study to become a nurse, but her love of writing won out and she received a BA in French literature. She received a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from Brown University in 1993.

Danticat is a strong advocate for issues affecting Haitians abroad and at home. In 2009, she lent her voice and words to &quot;Poto Mitan: Haitian Women Pillars of the Global Economy&quot;, a documentary about the impact of globalization on five women from different generations.

==Personal life==
Danticat married Fedo Boyer in 2002. She has two daughters, Mira and Leila.
Although Danticat resides in the United States, she still considers Haiti home. To date, she still visits Haiti from time to time and has always felt as if she never left it.

==Themes==
Three themes are prominent in various analyses of Edwidge Danticat&#x27;s work: national identity, mother-daughter relationships, and diasporic politics.

===National identity===
Scholars of Danticat&#x27;s work frequently examine the theme of national identity. In &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot;, Danticat explores the relationship between women and the nationalist agenda of the state [i] during the Duvalier regime. Throughout the novel, as generations of women &quot;test&quot; their daughters, by penetrating their vaginas with a finger to confirm their virginity, they &quot;become enforcers,&quot; or proxies, of the state&#x27;s &quot;violence and victimization&quot; of black women&#x27;s bodies (376–377) [i], similar to the paramilitary secret police Tonton Macoutes. However, while the women of &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; replicate &quot;state-sanctioned&quot; control and violation of women&#x27;s bodies through acts of violence (375), they also &quot;disrupt and challenge the masculinist, nationalist discourse&quot; of the state by using their bodies &quot;as deadly weapons&quot; (387) [i]. Evidence for this claim can be drawn from Martine&#x27;s suicide, seen as a tragic exhibition of freedom, releasing her body, and mind, from its past traumas [i]. Additionally, the novel demonstrates some inherent difficulties of creating a diasporic identity, as illustrated through Sophie&#x27;s struggle between uniting herself with her heritage and abandoning what she perceives to be the damaging tradition of &#x27;testing,&#x27; suggesting the impossibility of creating a resolute creolized personhood [ii]. Finally, Danticat&#x27;s work, The Farming of Bones, speaks to the stories of those who survived the 1937 massacre, and the effects of that trauma on Haitian identity [iv]. Overall, Danticat makes known the history of her nation while also diversifying conceptions of the country beyond those of victimization [iii].

===Mother-daughter relationships===
Danticat&#x27;s &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; explores the centrality of the mother-daughter relationship to self-identity and self-expression [v]. Sophie&#x27;s experiences mirror those of her mother&#x27;s Martine. Just as Martine was forced to submit to a virginity test at the hand of her own mother, she forces the same on Sophie after discovering her relationship with Joseph. As a result, Sophie goes through a period of self- hate, ashamed to show anyone her body, including her husband (80) [viii]. Sophie&#x27;s struggles to overcome frigidity in relation to intimacy with her husband Joseph, as well as her bulimia parallels Martine&#x27;s struggle bear a child with Marc to term, as well her insomnia, and detrimental eating habits (61–62) [v]. Due to Martine&#x27;s rape by a Tonton Macoute and Sophie&#x27;s abuse by her mother, &quot;each woman must come to terms with herself before she can enter into a healthy relationship with a man, and these men attempt to meet these women on the latter&#x27;s own terms&quot; (68) [vi].
The pinnacle of this mirroring comes when Sophie chooses to be her mother&#x27;s Marassa, a double of herself for her mother, to share the pain, the trials and the tribulations, the ultimate connection: to become one with her mother. Marassas represent &quot;sameness and love&quot; as one, they are &quot;inseparable and identical. They love each other because they are alike and always together&quot; [vii]. This connection between Sophie and her mother Martine has also been challenged through Sophie&#x27;s own connection with her daughter Brigitte: &quot;Martine&#x27;s totally nihilistic unwillingness to begin again with the draining responsibilities of motherhood comments upon and stands in stark contrast to Sophie&#x27;s loving desire to bring her daughter Brigitte into the welcoming&quot; (79) [viii].

===Diasporic politics===
Scholars agree that Danticat manages her relationship with her Haitian history and her bicultural identity through her works by creating a new space within the political sphere. In &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot;, Danticat employs the &quot;idea of mobile traditions&quot; as a means of creating new space for Haitian identity in America, one that is neither a &quot;happy hybridity&quot; nor an &quot;unproblematic creolization&quot; of Flatbush Brooklyn (28) [ix]. Danticat&#x27;s open reference to and acceptance of her Caribbean predecessors, especially through the &quot;grand narratives of the dead iconic fathers of Haitian literature,&quot; creates a &quot;new community [...] in luminal extra-national spaces&quot; that &quot;situates her narrative&quot; in a place that is neither &quot;absolute belonging&quot; nor &quot;postcolonial placelessness&quot; (34) [ix]. Suggestive of the Haitian literary movement Indigenism, in which works sought to connect to the land of Haiti and the &quot;plight of the peasant class&quot; (55) [x], Sophie&#x27;s complex reality in &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; encapsulates the transnational experience (61) [x]. Translations of &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot;, especially those in France, contain slight alterations and &quot;clumsy&quot; replacement of creol/Caribbean terms that shift the empowered stance of Danticat&#x27;s works to one of victimization, mirroring the fight authors face for a new political space in which dual Caribbean identity is accepted (68) [x]. Danticat&#x27;s short story cycles in &quot;Krik? Krak!&quot; demonstrates &quot;a symbolic weaving together&quot; of her works and the transnational communities, including &quot;Haitians, immigrants, women, [and] mothers and daughters,&quot; that she attempts to unite (75) [xi]. Through her &quot;voicing the intersubjective experience of a community,&quot; Danticat distinguishes herself from other Haitian prose authors (73, 76) [xi]. She creates a space for the &quot;voicelessness&quot; of those unable to &quot;speak their individual experience&quot; (76) [xi]. Danticat&#x27;s short stories uphold an undivided experience, one that politically aligns itself with an &quot;egalitarian regime of rights and the rule of law&quot; (81) [xi]. The political space in which such a single experience can exist is the means through which Danticat&#x27;s transnational identity and her characters can survive.

Another work of Danticat&#x27;s is her travel narrative &quot;After the Dance: A Walk through Carnival in Jacmel, Haiti&quot; (2002). She believes it provides readers with an inside look and feel of Haiti&#x27;s cultural legacy, practices related to Lent, its Carnival, and the Haitian Revolution. She embarks on a journey through her work to recover the lost cultural markers of Haiti while also being marked by the Haitian geopolitical privilege and by her own privilege of mobility. Due to her active traveling privilege, she considered herself an &quot;outsider&quot; of Jacmel even though she did originate from Haiti. She explains: &quot;This is the first time I will be an active reveler at a carnival in Haiti. I am worried that such an admission would appear strange for someone for whom carnival is one of life&#x27;s passions...As a child living in Haiti...I had never been allowed to &#x27;join the carnival&#x27; ... it was considered not safe for me...Since I had an intense desire to join the carnival as some peculiar American children have of joining the circus, my uncle for years spun frightening tales around it to keep me away.&quot; She said in her narrative of going back to Jacmel, &quot;I was still wearing my own mask of a distant observer.&quot; Because of this, she advises her reader to observe her work from the perspective of a diasporic returnee rather than of an insider.

==Awards and honors==
Danticat has won fiction awards from &quot;Essence&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazines, was named &quot;1 of 20 people in their twenties who will make a difference&quot; in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, was featured in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; as one of &quot;30 under 30&quot; people to watch, and was called one of the &quot;15 Gutsiest Women of the Year&quot; by &quot;Jane&quot; magazine.

===Critical reception===
Edwidge Danticat is an author, creator and participant in multiple forms of storytelling. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has remarked on Danticat&#x27;s ability to create a &quot;moving portrait and a vivid illustration&quot; as an &quot;accomplished novelist and memoirist&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has featured Danticat&#x27;s short stories and essays on multiple occasions, and regularly reviews and critiques her work. Her writing is much anthologized, including in 2019&#x27;s &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot; (edited by Margaret Busby).

Danticat&#x27;s creative branching out has included filmmaking, short stories, and most recently children&#x27;s literature. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Nightingale&quot; was written to share the story of Haitian immigrants and family separation. The book combines Danticat&#x27;s storytelling abilities and work by accomplished artist Leslie Staub. Published in 2015 by Penguin Random House, the children&#x27;s book tells &quot;a touching tale of parent-child separation and immigration...with stirring illustrations...and shows how every child has the power to make a difference.&quot; A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Mama&#x27;s Nightingale&quot; &quot;will inspire not just empathy for the struggles of childhood immigration, but admiration&quot; of Danticat and Staub, too.

In other creative pursuits, Danticat has worked on two films, &quot;Poto Mitan&quot; and &quot;Girl Rising&quot;. The latter received a large amount of press, largely due to the star power involved with the film (including Anne Hathaway, Chloë Grace Moretz, Liam Neeson, Meryl Streep, Alicia Keys and Kerry Washington). In the film, Danticat was tasked with narrating the story of Wadley from Haiti. &quot;Girl Rising&quot; was defined by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;a lengthy, highly effective PSA designed to kickstart a commitment to getting proper education for all young women, all over the globe&quot;.

In &quot;Create Dangerously: The Immigrant Artist at Work&quot;, Danticat tells her own story as a part of the Haitian diaspora. &quot;Create Dangerously&quot; was inspired by author Albert Camus&#x27;s lecture &quot;Create Dangerously&quot; and his experience as an author and creator who defined his art as &quot;a revolt against everything fleeting and unfinished in the world&quot;. In &quot;Create Dangerously&quot;, Danticat is admired for &quot;writing about tragedies and vanished cultures&quot; and how &quot;she accepts that by some accident she exists and has the power to create, so she does.&quot; NPR positively reviewed &quot;Create Dangerously&quot; and the journey through &quot;looming loss [which] makes every detail and person to whom we are introduced more luminous and precious.&quot; It was chosen by University of Kansas as the 2018–19 Common Book, which is distributed to all first-year students at the University.

Danticat published her first novel at the age of 25 in 1994, since when she has been acclaimed by critics and audience readers alike. Among her best-known books are &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; (1994), &quot;Krik? Krak!&quot; (1996), &quot;The Dew Breaker&quot; (2004), &quot;Brother, I&#x27;m Dying&quot; (2007) and (1994). Each of these works has won awards, including the National Book Award, The Story Prize, and the National Books Critic Circle Award. Danticat usually writes about the different lives of people living in Haiti and the United States, using her own life as inspiration for her novels, typically highlighting themes of violence, class, economic troubles, gender disparities, and family.

&quot;The Dew Breaker&quot; is a collection of short stories that can either be read together or separately, and detail the intermingled lives of different people in Haiti and New York. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani said: &quot;Each tale in &#x27;Dew Breaker&#x27; can stand on its own beautifully made story, but they come together as jigsaw-puzzle pieces to create a picture of this man&#x27;s terrible history and his and his victims&#x27; afterlife.&quot; It was rated four out of five stars by Goodreads. &quot;Brother, I&#x27;m Dying&quot; is an autobiographical novel that tells her story of being in Haiti and moving to the United States, falling in love, and having a child. This is one of Danticat&#x27;s best-rated books and was named Top-10 African American Non-fiction Books by Booklist in 2008. For Jess Row of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it is &quot;giving us a memoir whose cleareyed prose and unflinching adherence to the facts conceal an astringent undercurrent of melancholy, a mixture of homesickness and homelessness&quot;. &quot;Krik? Krak!&quot; is a collection of short stories of women in Haiti, their trials and tribulations, which &quot;The Washington Post Book World&quot; called: &quot;virtually flawless. If the news from Haiti is too painful to read, read this book instead and understand the place more deeply than you ever thought possible.&quot; Finally, &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; was Danticat&#x27;s first novel. It tells the story of a girl, a child of rape, as she moves from Haiti to New York City and discovering the traumatic experience her mother endured, and many other women did. This book was chosen for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in 1998 and also received four out of five stars on Goodreads. Oprah said it had &quot;vibrant imagery and narrative grace that bear witness to her people&#x27;s suffering and courage.&quot;

<doc id="1169707" wikidata="Q1153019" url="?curid=1169707" title="MagicGate">
<text>MagicGate (MG) is a copy-protection technology introduced by Sony in 1999 as part of the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI). It works by encrypting the content on the device and using MagicGate chips in both the storage device and the reader to enforce control over how files are copied.

MagicGate encryption was introduced with Sony&#x27;s first digital audio players, with the related OpenMG technology being its software counterpart. Since then, the encryption has been rolled out to other Sony devices – it is used in the memory cards of the PlayStation 2 and, , has been introduced into all of Sony&#x27;s Memory Stick products. Some devices will only accept Memory Sticks which use MagicGate technology.

All Memory Stick Duo cards equipped with MagicGate can be identified by a notch located on the rear end of the card.

== Support ==
Few (USB or PC Card) Memory Stick-compatible memory card readers support secure MagicGate. Although manufacturers list Memory Stick Pro/Pro Duo (MG) compatibility, where MG means MagicGate, they may not support the security portion of MagicGate. This becomes important when purchasing a card reader/writer for use with SonicStage and Sony CONNECT as even Sony itself does not fully support MagicGate on certain readers. Non-MagicGate memory card reader/writers do not show up in SonicStage, with the notable exception of Sony Ericsson phones.

Current Sony devices that support MagicGate DRM as of summer 2007:
* Most Memory Stick capable Sony VAIO notebooks and desktops
* PlayStation Portable – The PlayStation Portable in service mode will only boot to Memory Sticks with MagicGate enabled
* PlayStation Vita – Used for verifying memory cards and PSP Emulation
* PlayStation 3
* MSAC-US40 USB Memory Stick Card Reader/Writer
* PlayStation 2

Current Sony Devices that do not support MagicGate DRM as of summer 2007:
* All U.S. Sony Ericsson phones – most Sony Ericsson phones should show up in SonicStage for MP3/AAC transfer
* VGP-MCA10 PCMCIA Card Reader/Writer – does not sport the MagicGate logo
* Sony 17 in 1 Card Reader/Writer MRW62E/S1/181
* Sony AVCHD camcorders such as HDR-UX5/UX7

Current Sony Devices that do not support MagicGate DRM as of summer 2007, but the support may be possible via future firmware updates:
* Mylo Personal Communicator – Mylo&#x27;s 1GB internal memory can be used with SonicStage and supports OpenMG
* Sony Reader portable e-reader PRS-500 &amp; PRS-600 – may show up in SonicStage for MP3/AAC transfer.

=== State of DRM ===
In March 2009, Sony Electronics announced they were phasing out the Sony CONNECT service in favor of Windows Media Audio &amp; Windows Media DRM, though they have not officially announced plans to continue a Windows Media DRM music service, either. As of June 2009, the future of MagicGate DRM was unknown. MagicGate slots were still a part of the default Vaio configuration as of May 2010.

<text>Lucky Wander Boy is the 2003 debut novel by D. B. Weiss. The book&#x27;s official website describes the work as: &quot;A novel of video game addiction, Hollywood serfdom, ill-fated romance and extremely misguided notions about Japan, Lucky Wander Boy marks the debut of an original new voice that will captivate wanderers of every description.&quot;

== Plot introduction ==

The story involves Adam Pennyman and his obsession with and attempts to catalog video games into a book called &quot;The Catalogue of Obsolete Entertainments&quot;. He is particularly obsessed with the fictional Japanese arcade game &quot;Lucky Wander Boy&quot;.

While the &quot;Lucky Wander Boy&quot; game is fictional, many actual classic arcade and home video games are mentioned in the book.

==Reception==

Salon.com&#x27;s Andrew Leonard referred to &quot;Lucky Wander Boy &quot;as &quot;smart and engaging&quot; and complimented the novel&#x27;s ironic humor and intricate structure.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, however, considered it a &quot;postmodern yawn&quot; which would appeal only to &quot;Trekkies and Donkey Kong fanatics&quot;.

<text>WBRC (channel 6) is a television station in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Gray Media alongside low-power, Class A Telemundo affiliate WTBM-CD (channel 24). The two stations studios atop Red Mountain (between Vulcan Trail and Valley View Drive) in southeastern Birmingham, where WBRC&#x27;s transmitter is also located.

==History==
===Early history===
The station first signed on the air on July 1, 1949, originally broadcasting on VHF channel 4 as WBRC-TV (standing for Bell Radio Company, after Fountain Heights physician J. C. Bell, founder of radio station WBRC (960 AM, now WERC); the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix was dropped from the call sign in June 1999). Although WBRC-TV was the first television station in Birmingham to be granted a license by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), it is the second-oldest television station in Alabama, signing on just over one month after WAFM-TV (channel 13, now WVTM-TV), which debuted on May 29. It was originally owned by the Birmingham Broadcasting Company, run by Eloise D. Hanna, along with WBRC radio. Hanna&#x27;s first husband, M. D. Smith, had bought WBRC radio from Bell in 1928. Her son, M. D. Smith III, who worked at the radio stations in advertising sales and was later promoted to program director and vice president, ran the television station as its operations manager. His son, M. D. Smith IV later organized Smith Broadcasting, which purchased WAFG-TV, Channel 31 in Huntsville, Alabama in 1963, with himself as operations manager. The call letters were immediately changed to WAAY-TV. M. D. Smith III is also named a remote general manager of WAAY-TV from Birmingham.

Originally broadcasting for three hours per day, it operated as a primary NBC affiliate (earning the affiliation as a result of WBRC radio&#x27;s longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network), and also carried secondary affiliations with ABC and the DuMont Television Network; during the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. WBRC-TV originally operated from WBRC radio&#x27;s facilities on 19th Street and 2nd Avenue, near downtown Birmingham, which originally only housed business and master control operations; the station originally relied mainly on network and film content for much of the programming it broadcast. The station&#x27;s transmitter was originally purposed as the transmitter facilities for radio station WBRC-FM (102.5, now WBPT at 106.9 FM; original frequency now occupied by WDXB), which signed on in 1947 with the highest radiated power of any radio station worldwide, operating at 500,000 watts; after the FM station suspended operations in June 1948 due to continued revenue losses due to the lack of radios equipped with FM tuners, Hanna borrowed $150,000 to build a new studio facility and transmitter atop Red Mountain for the television station. In September 1950, WBRC established a coaxial cable link with fellow NBC-DuMont affiliate WRGB (now a CBS affiliate) in Schenectady, New York, allowing the station to broadcast NBC and DuMont network programs both live and live-to-air.

On February 19, 1953, WBRC-TV moved to channel 6 as part of a frequency realignment ordered by the FCC, resulting from the &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; issued the year prior in 1952. This move was made to alleviate signal interference problems between WBRC and WSM-TV (now sister station WSMV-TV) in Nashville, which also transmitted on channel 4, that were present in portions of northern Alabama. Later that year, Hanna also sold the WBRC television and radio stations to Storer Broadcasting for $2.3 million—a handsome return on her first husband&#x27;s purchase of WBRC radio 25 years earlier. George B. Storer, the company&#x27;s founder and chairman, was a member of the board of directors at CBS, and most of his television stations were affiliates of that network. Storer may have used his leverage to secure a primary CBS affiliation for WBRC-TV, which joined the network on July 4, 1954. NBC programming subsequently moved to channel 13 (by then, using the call sign WABT); both stations, however, retained a secondary affiliation with ABC.

On September 17 of that year, the WBRC stations moved to a new, much larger studio facility located on Red Mountain that was built by Storer, where channel 6 continues to operate from to this day. The building, like many of those built by Storer to serve as studios for its broadcast properties, resembled an antebellum mansion. While it may have been out of place in most of Storer&#x27;s other markets (many of which were located outside of the Southern United States), it was a perfect fit for Birmingham. Unusual for a commercial broadcaster, Storer supported educational television, and the company donated two transmitters and frequencies in the Birmingham market (channels 7 and 10, which were respectively occupied by WCIQ and WBIQ when both stations signed on in 1955) to Alabama Educational Television (now Alabama Public Television). This also, however, may have been a move to forestall future commercial competition in the market; WBRC and WABT remained the only commercial stations in Birmingham, which would not get a third commercial broadcast television outlet until WBMG (now WIAT) debuted in October 1965, on UHF channel 42, a signal considerably weaker than that of either channels 6 or 13, and a problem which hampered that station&#x27;s progress until the early 2000s.

In 1957, Storer sold the WBRC stations to Radio Cincinnati Inc., the forerunner of what would become Taft Broadcasting, for $2.3 million. Storer had to sell its broadcast holdings in Birmingham after it purchased radio station WIBG (now WNTP) in Philadelphia and its television sister, WPFH (later WVUE) in Wilmington, Delaware (whose frequency is now occupied by WHYY-TV), to comply with the FCC&#x27;s ownership limits of that time period.

===As an exclusive ABC affiliate===

On March 1, 1961, WBRC-TV signed an agreement with ABC to become a full-time affiliate of the network. This was very unusual for a market with only two commercial stations; usually, one or both stations carried ABC as a secondary affiliation, since that network would not be on anything resembling an equal footing with CBS and NBC until the 1970s. However, Taft had very good relations with ABC. The company&#x27;s chairman was a personal friend of ABC&#x27;s president Leonard Goldenson, and several of Taft&#x27;s other stations, including flagship WKRC-TV in Cincinnati (which would rejoin CBS in 1996), had recently switched to ABC. During the 1970s, ABC aired cartoons from Hanna-Barbera, whose studios were acquired by Taft in 1967. Taft later bought ABC&#x27;s former syndication arm, Worldvision Enterprises, in 1979 (ABC spun off this division in 1973 as a result of fin-syn laws, which have since been repealed). This also marked a significant turnaround for channel 6&#x27;s relationship with the network, as during the later 1950s, the amount of ABC programming on WBRC had been dramatically reduced from about 50% of its schedule to only a very limited selection of shows, seemingly headed toward an exclusive CBS affiliation by 1960; even still, WBRC retained some of CBS&#x27; higher-rated soap operas on its daytime schedule until about 1968, when those programs moved to either WAPI-TV or WBMG.

Another factor, though supposedly not as important as the Taft-Goldenson relationship, was CBS News&#x27; apparent strong support of the Civil Rights Movement, which did not sit well with many white viewers, a large segment of WBRC&#x27;s audience. An urban legend regarding the ABC affiliation agreement suggested that the switch was partly motivated by CBS&#x27; plans to air &quot;Who Speaks For Birmingham?&quot;, a controversial &quot;CBS Reports&quot; documentary focusing on desegregation at Birmingham City Schools that later led to journalist Howard K. Smith&#x27;s resignation from CBS News after he quoted an anti-desegregation statement by political scientist Edmund Burke in the closing narration, viewed by network president William S. Paley as editorializing his views in support of school integration; however, the special aired on May 18 of that year, two months after the ABC agreement was signed. ABC had very few full-time affiliates south of Washington, D.C. at the time, but now it had the full benefit of one of the South&#x27;s strongest signals, best antenna locations and largest coverage areas. WBRC-TV&#x27;s signal provided at least secondary coverage as far north as Decatur and extending south to near Montgomery, and from the Mississippi border in the west to the Georgia border in the east. In addition, although FM broadcasting was in its infancy at the time of the network switch, the advantage of channel 6&#x27;s audio being heard at 87.7 FM at the far end of the FM dial would be taken advantage of by WBRC in promotional advertising up until the 2009 digital transition, allowing the station&#x27;s audience to listen to the station and ABC network programming on both traditional radio receivers and car stereos. The station&#x27;s weather department designed its presentations to relay information for both its traditional television and radio audiences in severe weather situations.

The station became exclusively affiliated with ABC on September 7, 1961; on that date, channel 13 (by then known as WAPI-TV) assumed rights to CBS and NBC programming, although WBRC continued to occasionally carry certain CBS shows that WAPI chose not to carry through 1965. In 1972, Taft sold the WBRC radio stations, which changed their call letters to WERC-AM and FM.

In 1966, WBRC-TV began broadcasting local programming in color, after the station purchased two color cameras; among the first local programs to be produced in color was the Alabama Crimson Tide football coaches&#x27; program, &quot;The Bear Bryant Show&quot; (originated from CBS affiliate WCOV-TV (now also a Fox affiliate) in Montgomery, the first television station in the state to begin color broadcasts), which aired on WBRC until 1970, when it moved to WAPI-TV. Meanwhile, WBRC-TV had become one of ABC&#x27;s strongest affiliates, a position it retained for the next quarter-century. For a time, it incorporated the ABC circle logo inside its own &quot;6&quot; logo (just as it had done with the CBS eye in the 1950s). Channel 6 could make a plausible claim to be not only the most-watched station in the Birmingham market but in the entire state of Alabama, thanks in part to unusually weak competition. CBS affiliate WBMG (channel 42, now WIAT), which signed on in October 1965 as the market&#x27;s third commercial television station, was not a factor and, in fact, was among the lowest-rated major-network affiliates in the nation at some points, making Birmingham a &quot;de facto&quot; two-station market to industry observers from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s. Even still, due to signal impairment in mountainous areas of northeastern Alabama, WBRC operated two low-power translators to extend its programming to that part of the state, W29AO (channel 29) in Anniston in W15AP (channel 15) in Gadsden.

In 1982, WBRC began receiving ABC network and syndicated programming, and news footage via satellite. In 1984, the station became one of the first television stations in the region to adopt a 24-hour-a-day programming schedule. After it suffered significant structural damage due to an ice storm that affected the Southeastern U.S. in the winter of 1985, the station&#x27;s original transmitter tower was replaced in 1986, with a new tower on Red Mountain east of the original tower&#x27;s location. In October 1987, Taft was restructured into Great American Communications following the completion of a hostile takeover of the group. In December 1993, Great American Communications was restructured again into Citicasters after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Citicasters then decided to put most of its television stations up for sale. These moves, though, did not immediately affect WBRC&#x27;s high standing in the ratings or its reputation in the community.

===As a Fox station===
On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which would later be renamed Citicasters following the completion of its restructuring) agreed to sell WBRC and three other television stations – WDAF-TV in Kansas City, KSAZ-TV in Phoenix and WGHP in High Point, North Carolina – to New World Communications – for $350 million in cash and $10 million in share warrants. However, three weeks later, New World agreed to purchase four stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings, WVTM being among them, in a purchase option-structured deal for $717 million (although the transfer/assignment applications for the stations involved in the Argyle purchases were not filed with the FCC until after New World&#x27;s acquisition of the four Citicasters stations was completed); this posed a problem for New World on two counts. At the time, the FCC forbade any broadcasting company from owning two commercial television stations in the same market; in addition, the concurrent acquisitions of the Argyle and Citicasters stations put New World three stations over the national television ownership cap that the agency enforced at the time, which allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of twelve stations nationwide.

On May 23, 1994, New World signed an affiliation agreement with Fox to switch twelve television stations – six that New World had already owned and eight that the company was in the process of acquiring through the Argyle and Citicasters deals, including WBRC – to the network, in exchange for the latter&#x27;s then-parent company News Corporation purchasing a 20% equity stake in New World; the stations would become Fox affiliates once their affiliation contracts with existing network partners expired (with the first stations involved in the deal switching to the network in September 1994). Although the network&#x27;s Birmingham charter affiliate, WTTO (channel 21), was one of Fox&#x27;s strongest affiliates at the time, the network found the chance to align with WBRC too much to resist because of its longstanding ratings dominance in the market. The group&#x27;s affiliation deal with Fox also gave New World a chance to solve its ownership problem by reaching an agreement with Citicasters to sell WBRC and WGHP directly to the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station group, Fox Television Stations.

Fox was unable to immediately purchase the two stations outright due to questions over the American citizenship of then-parent company News Corporation&#x27;s Australian-born CEO Rupert Murdoch. New World then decided to acquire the stations itself, but place them in an outside trust company that it established; New World would sell the stations to Fox Television Stations, which, in turn, would pay the group $130 million in promissory notes upon the transfer&#x27;s completion. New World formally filed an application with the FCC to transfer WBRC to the trust on October 12, 1994, one month after it filed transferred WGHP on September 9; the FCC approved the transfer on April 3, 1995. Under the arrangement, New World owned the licenses of both stations, while Citicasters continued to control their operations under outsourcing agreements. In April 1995, Citicasters transferred the operations of WBRC and WGHP to Fox Television Stations, which took over operational control through time brokerage agreements with New World and purchased the stations three months later on July 22; Fox formally finalized the purchase of the two stations on January 17, 1996.

Although it was now owned by the O&amp;O group of another network, Fox now had to run channel 6 as an ABC affiliate for more than a year after the purchase was announced as WBRC&#x27;s affiliation agreement with that network was not set to expire until August 31, 1996. This gave ABC a sufficient amount of time to find another station to replace channel 6 as its central Alabama affiliate. In January 1996, ABC struck a deal with Allbritton Communications to affiliate with CBS stations WCFT-TV (channel 33, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WSES) in Tuscaloosa and WJSU-TV (channel 40, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WGWW) in Anniston (the latter of which Allbritton had agreed to operate under a local marketing agreement with then-owner Osborne Communications Corporation weeks prior); because Tuscaloosa and Anniston were then separate markets, which would result in neither station being counted in Nielsen ratings reports for Birmingham, Allbritton purchased low-power station W58CK (channel 58, now WBMA-LD), creating a triple-simulcast with WCFT and WJSU, which would act as its satellite stations.

WBRC became a Fox owned-and-operated station on September 1, 1996, ending its affiliation with ABC after 47 years; however, the station had begun airing the network&#x27;s short-lived morning program &quot;Fox After Breakfast&quot; for one month prior to the switch after it dropped &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from its schedule. The concurrent move of the ABC affiliation to W58CK and its satellites also led to the CBS affiliation for the Anniston-Gadsden market to move to WNAL-TV (channel 44, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXH-TV), which—along with WTTO and its Tuscaloosa satellite WDBB (channel 17)—lost its Fox affiliation to WBRC.

With the switch to Fox, WBRC became one of only a few television stations in the United States to have maintained primary affiliations with all of the Big Three networks, and the only one in the country to have had primary affiliations with all four current major networks; it also became the first network-owned commercial television station in the state of Alabama. At that time, WBRC phased out its longstanding &quot;Channel 6&quot; brand and began branding itself as &quot;Fox 6&quot;, becoming one of three Fox stations affected by the affiliation deal between the network and New World to adopt Fox&#x27;s standardized station branding conventions prior to the group&#x27;s 1996 merger with Fox Television Stations (WGHP and WJBK in Detroit, which became a sister station to WBRC as a result of the New World merger, were the only others to comply with the network&#x27;s branding techniques; the remaining ten stations did not incorporate network branding until after the merger was finalized). After New World merged with Fox in 1997, WBRC was reunited with four of its sister stations from the Storer era: WJBK, WAGA-TV in Atlanta, WJW in Cleveland and WITI in Milwaukee.

WBRC would become the only remaining station in the Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market that was owned by a major commercial broadcast television network, after Media General completed its acquisition of WVTM from NBC Television Stations on June 26, 2006. However, on December 22, 2007, Fox announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell WBRC and seven other Fox owned-and-operated stations (WDAF-TV, WGHP, WJW, WITI, KTVI in St. Louis, KDVR in Denver and KSTU in Salt Lake City) to Local TV, a holding company operated by equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners that had earlier purchased The New York Times Company&#x27;s television station division; the sale was finalized on July 14, 2008. On January 6, 2009, Local TV announced that it would trade WBRC to Raycom Media in exchange for acquiring CBS affiliate WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia from that group. Raycom—which was controlled by the Retirement Systems of Alabama—was headquartered in Montgomery (the market to the adjacent south of the Birmingham DMA), and also owned that market&#x27;s NBC affiliate WSFA as well as Huntsville NBC affiliate WAFF. The transfer closed on March 31, 2009.

On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WBRC), and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under the former&#x27;s corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion—in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom—resulted in WBRC gaining new sister stations in adjacent markets, including ABC affiliate WTOK-TV in Meridian and CBS/NBC affiliates WTVY and WRGX-LD in Dothan (while separating it from WDFX), in addition to the current Raycom stations. The sale was approved on December 20 and completed on January 2, 2019.

==Programming==
WBRC currently carries the majority of the Fox network schedule, though it delays the network&#x27;s Saturday late night block (currently a repeat of a prime time reality show) one hour due to the station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast and its carriage of the syndicated sports interview program &quot;In Depth with Graham Bensinger&quot;; in addition, following the program&#x27;s move from Fox Sports 1 to Fox in September 2015, WBRC formerly was one of several Fox affiliates that has declined carriage of the Sunday pre-game show &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot; during the NFL regular season due to existing programming contracts (unlike in other markets where a Fox station has declined carriage of &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot;, the program was not broadcast by any other station in the Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market). The station began clearing &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot; for the 2016 season. Channel 6 has only aired Fox&#x27;s prime time, news and sports programming since it joined the network in September 1996, with the only programs relating to Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming blocks for the final twelve years that Fox carried programming aimed at that demographic consisting of fall preview specials and network promotions that aired within the network&#x27;s prime time lineup.

WBRC became the first television station to broadcast the United Cerebral Palsy Telethon, an event to raise money for the cerebral palsy research organization that premiered in 1949; it was from WBRC that the event emerged into national prominence, with national celebrities even making appearances on the telecast. Even in its final years on WBRC, mini-documentaries produced by the station (which were produced by Randy Mize and Tom Stovall) for the local segments aired during the UCP Telethon; WBRC stopped producing and broadcasting the local segments of the telethon soon after it switched to Fox in 1996. WBRC began producing live local programming in 1950 after it converted the building that formerly housed WBRC-FM into a makeshift television studio; the station also acquired additional studio camera equipment, including shows such as &quot;Coffee Break&quot;, &quot;Supersonic Sam&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Theatre&quot;.

Like many network affiliates, WBRC-TV would preempt ABC programming occasionally or regularly, in some cases. For example, according to local legends, the station initially turned down &quot;Bewitched&quot;, not because it was concerned about witchcraft, but because it concerned a mixed marriage (between a witch and a mortal); there were fears that &quot;Bewitched&quot; would encourage what some segregationists referred to as &quot;cross-breeding&quot;; channel 6 would not clear &quot;Bewitched&quot; until 1967 (although, according to the October 15, 1965, issue of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot; was shown airing at its in-pattern time of Thursdays at 8 p.m. (Central) on WBRC). Channel 6 continued these practices for most of its years with ABC. It also preempted the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; (the forerunner to &quot;World News Tonight&quot;) from the program&#x27;s debut in 1968 until August 7, 1972 (when both it and WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan, became the last two ABC affiliates to begin airing the network newscast), as well as daytime network programs at aired during the 10 a.m. hour. However, ABC largely brushed off the preemption issue, even though it would eventually become the No. 1 network nationwide by the late 1970s, because of WBRC&#x27;s status as central Alabama&#x27;s dominant station.

WBRC cemented viewer allegiances by carrying a heavy schedule of local programs during the 1960s and 1970s, most notably two long-running morning shows. The first was &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, hosted by sports anchor Tom York; airing for 32 years from 1957 to 1989, it was a more general-interest interview and features program that was formatted basically a local version of &quot;Today&quot;; WBRC anchor Joe Langston (who also hosted the children&#x27;s programs &quot;Birthday Party&quot; and &quot;Junior Auction&quot; for the station in the late 1960s) and comedian Fannie Flagg joined as York&#x27;s co-hosts in the early 1960s (Flagg would leave for Los Angeles in 1964 to become a writer for &quot;Candid Camera&quot;). Fiddler, guitarist and vocalist Eddie Burns was invited to bring his musical group to serve as &quot;The Morning Show&quot;″s house band and act as the program&#x27;s bandleader; however, within a few months, station management offered Burns his own morning program on channel 6. That series, &quot;Country Boy Eddie&quot;, which was aimed at rural Alabama viewers, featured local country, bluegrass and Southern Gospel music artists during its 36-year run from 1957 until December 31, 1993. Over time, Burns added novelty acts to the show&#x27;s format and did most of the commercials himself in the studio live.

York&#x27;s program, meanwhile, was so popular that, when ABC debuted &quot;AM America&quot; in January 1975, WBRC declined to carry it—preferring not to alter, let alone cancel, what had become a local television institution in &quot;The Morning Show&quot;; this continued after ABC replaced the more news-driven &quot;AM America&quot; with &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, which maintained a format similar to York&#x27;s program, in November of that year. WBRC began to clear the first hour of &quot;GMA&quot; in the early 1980s, and began airing the two-hour program in its entirety after York retired from the station in 1989. Preemptions and out-of-pattern scheduling of some ABC programs would continue in later years; for example, WBRC aired &quot;All My Children&quot; on a one-day delay from its 1970 debut until it became a Fox station, and preempted the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot; throughout its 1986 to 1994 run.

Channel 6 originally planned to carry the entire Fox programming schedule when it switched to the network, including its children&#x27;s program block, Fox Kids; it intended to air the weekday editions of that block from 1 to 4 p.m. on Monday through Friday afternoons. However, in what would be the catalyst to a change in the carriage policies for Fox Kids that allowed stations the option of either airing the block or being granted the right to transfer the rights to another station in the market, Sinclair Broadcast Group approached WBRC about retaining the rights to Fox Kids for WTTO, which became an independent station on September 1; Fox allowed WTTO to retain the local rights to the block. WBRC also declined to carry &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;, the infomercial block that Fox replaced its remaining Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming block with in January 2009; the rights were instead acquired by WABM. WBRC and WGHP were the only Fox-owned stations that did not air the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program blocks until 2003, when now-former sister stations KTTV in Los Angeles and WFLD in Chicago moved the block to their UPN-affiliated sister stations (KCOP-TV and WPWR-TV).

On September 17, 2024, Gray and the New Orleans Pelicans announced a broader deal to form the Gulf Coast Sports &amp; Entertainment Network, which will broadcast nearly all 2024–25 Pelicans games on Gray&#x27;s stations in the Gulf South, including WBRC.

===News operation===

WBRC presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11 hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output in the state of Alabama. In addition, the station produces &quot;Fox 6 Sideline&quot;, a high school football program that debuted in September 1989 as an ABC affiliate, which airs Friday nights after the 10 p.m. newscasts during the fall. The station has the largest news staff of any television station in Alabama, with around half of its approximately 160 employees employed with the news department in on-air, administrative and production positions.

====News department history====
WBRC has been the ratings leader in the market for most of the last half-century, dating back to its tenure as an ABC affiliate. Its newscasts were also among the highest-rated local news programs in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s; WBRC had won practically every news timeslot for many years, with WAPI-TV/WVTM-TV coming in at a distant second until the mid-2000s; CBS affiliate WBMG/WIAT was not a factor for either station for most of its history (to the point where it did not even air any newscasts at three different periods between the early 1980s and February 1998). As a Fox station, WBRC has continued to maintain higher viewership than the other television news outlets in the market, although it has experienced tighter competition since the early 2000s against WBMA-LD and a resurgent WIAT (both of which currently engage in a spirited competition for second place); WBRC&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast has consistently ranked as one of the most-watched prime time newscasts in the U.S. for most of its run since its debut in 1996.

WBRC television&#x27;s news operations began with the launch of the station in 1949, originally consisting of five-minute-long newscasts at sign-on and sign-off that were originally anchored by operations manager M.D. Smith III, who read wire copies of local news headlines over a slide of the station&#x27;s logo. In September 1950, at which time newscasts were expanded to 15 minutes, anchor segments began to be conducted in-studio after it acquired camera equipment to recorded live programming; kinescopes of 16-mm film footage shot by a photographer for local stories and still photographs for illustration of national and international stories were used for story content. The station launched a full-scale news department in 1952, when it began operating from the former studios of the original WBRC-FM. Several members of the news department staff in its early years started at WBRC radio including news anchors Harry Mabry and Joe Langston (the latter of whom would also take on a management role as its director of news and editorial policy in 1969), and sports anchor Tom York. In 1969, former WSGN radio anchor Bill Bolen joined WBRC to replace Harry Mabry as the station&#x27;s main news anchor; Bolen would remain a fixture at channel 6 (eventually becoming anchor of the station&#x27;s weekday morning newscast in 1990) for 42 years until his retirement in 2010. In 1978, WBRC became the first television station in the Birmingham market to acquire a microwave truck for electronic news-gathering purposes, and became the first to provide live breaking news coverage on-scene.

The station would not begin producing half-hour evening newscasts until 1979, eleven years after ABC expanded its national evening newscast to 30 minutes. Station management declined ABC&#x27;s insistence that WBRC expand its 6 p.m. newscast to match the length of the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot;; however, the 15-minute local newscast beat &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; on WAPI-TV/WVTM and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on WBMG in the ratings. In 1979, channel 6 became the first television station in Alabama to acquire a helicopter for newsgathering, &quot;Chopper 6&quot;. In 1983, Bev Montgomery made history as the first African American to anchor a newscast in the Birmingham market when he was appointed anchor of the station&#x27;s weekend evening newscasts. In 1988, the station acquired satellite news-gathering vehicles, &quot;Skylink 6&quot;, to conduct and beam live remote footage transmitted to the studio via satellite.

After WBRC became a Fox station in September 1996, the station shifted its programming focus heavily towards local news, increasing its output from about 25 hours a week to around 40 hours. The station retained all of the newscasts that existed during its final years as an ABC affiliate, but expanded its weekday morning newscast from one to three hours (with the addition of a two-hour extension, known for most of its run as &quot;Good Day Alabama&quot;, from 7 to 9 a.m.), and bridged the separate 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts on Monday through Friday nights to form a 90-minute early-evening news block (by adding a half-hour newscast at 5:30). Channel 6 also launched a prime time newscast at 9 p.m. to compensate for the lack of prime time programming provided by Fox during that hour; however, it filled the 9:30 p.m. half-hour with syndicated programs (originally reruns of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, then from 1997 afterward, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;) as a tentpole between the 9 and 10 p.m. newscasts from the September 1996 switch until September 2002, when it expanded the prime time newscast to one hour (WBRC is one of several Fox stations that offer newscasts in both the final hour of prime time and the traditional late news timeslot, one of the few affiliated with the network that runs a nightly newscast in the latter slot and one of the few to continue its Big Three-era late-evening newscast after switching to Fox). In addition to compensating for the absence of daily national morning and evening newscasts on Fox&#x27;s schedule, the expansion of WBRC&#x27;s news lineup also filled timeslots vacated by the departures of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;World News Tonight&quot; through the discontinuance of its ABC affiliation. WBRC also lost several longtime anchors and reporters to the W58CK/WCFT/WJSU trimulcast at that time, including news anchors Linda Mays and Brenda Ladun, meteorologists James Spann (who himself reportedly left WBRC due to his disapproval over the edgier content of Fox&#x27;s programming) and Mark Prater, and sports anchor Mike Raita.

In 2009, WBRC became a founding member station of the Raycom News Network, a service created to allow the sharing of news resources among the four Raycom-owned television stations that serve Alabama – including NBC affiliate WSFA in Montgomery, NBC affiliate WAFF in Huntsville and ABC affiliate WTVM in Columbus, Georgia (the latter of which includes a portion of eastern Alabama in its service area) – which combined, cover almost half of Alabama&#x27;s population. The service allows the stations to pool story content seen on the stations&#x27; newscasts and websites, as well as share information and newsgathering equipment (such as satellite trucks). The four stations also comprise the Raycom Weather Network and the Raycom Alabama Weather Blog, where meteorologists from all four stations post forecasts and storm reports, and which provide live feeds from cameras and Doppler weather radar systems that each of the stations operate (the only Raycom-owned station in Alabama that did not participate in the arrangement was fellow Fox affiliate WDFX-TV in Dothan, whose news programming was produced by WSFA under a news share agreement and is no longer a sister station to those other stations).

On July 14, 2009, the station eliminated its Saturday evening 5 p.m. newscast due to budget cutbacks at the station spurred by the economic downturn. On October 26, 2009, WBRC became the second television station in the Birmingham-Tuscaloosa-Anniston market (after WVTM-TV)—and the third station in Alabama—to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; the news set and the graphics were also redesigned as part of the transition.

On September 12, 2016, the station debuted a 4 p.m. newscast, placing the station in competition with WVTM and WBMA, which have both aired 4 p.m. newscasts for several years.

====Controversy====
=====David Neal lawsuit=====
In May 2008, David Neal (who had been with WBRC since 1997) filed a breach of contract and fraud lawsuit against WBRC and members of the station&#x27;s management team, after he was fired as chief meteorologist of the station&#x27;s weather department without explanation that March. The station denied any wrongdoing, and began defending the lawsuit. In July 2008, the station announced that James-Paul Dice – a former meteorologist at CBS affiliate WHNT-TV in Huntsville – would replace Neal as chief meteorologist. On July 29, 2008, the parties to the lawsuit filed a stipulation of dismissal, stating that the dispute had been resolved in mediation. The terms of the settlement were not immediately disclosed. Neal now works for WeatherNation as chief meteorologist.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBRC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, at 8:55 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50, using virtual channel 6.

The station operated its digital transmission facilities under special temporary authorization at a lower effective radiated power until October 2009, when its transmitter was upgraded to full power at 1 megawatt at a position on the tower at . The FCC later granted WBRC to reclaim the top level of the tower for its main antenna, improving its digital coverage area (the former main antenna remains in use as an auxiliary antenna).

<doc id="1169759" wikidata="Q334761" url="?curid=1169759" title="Lake Ülemiste">
<text>Lake Ülemiste () is the largest of the lakes surrounding Tallinn, Estonia. Ülemiste is the main part of the Tallinn water supply system, which supplies the city with most of its drinking water. The lake is fed mostly by Kurna stream and the Pirita River, through the Vaskjala–Ülemiste canal.

Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport is located on the eastern shore of the lake and aircraft regularly take off and land over the lake. The airport maintains the necessary equipment ready to salvage in a short time any aircraft that crashes into the lake, as required by International Civil Aviation Organization regulations.

The Tallinn Water Company, AS Tallinna Vesi, has a treatment plant on the north shore of the lake which supplies 90% of the water to the city. The remaining 10% comes from ground water wells, which are maintained as a backup in case the lake becomes contaminated. On 18 March 2010, a DHL Antonov An-26 aircraft made an emergency landing on the ice of the lake, leaking about 1 ton of fuel. All of the pollution was eventually removed.

Administratively, Lake Ülemiste is part of Tallinn&#x27;s central district Kesklinn, and constitutes Ülemistejärve subdistrict with its neighbouring forests. , the population of the subdistrict is 203.

==Mythology and fiction==
In the lake there is boulder called &quot;Lindakivi&quot; (&quot;Linda&#x27;s rock&quot;). In Estonian mythology, it is believed to be one of the boulders Linda was supposed to carry to Kalev&#x27;s grave at Toompea, but which fell off her apron. She sat on the boulder and cried, thus creating the lake.

The mythological &quot;Ülemiste Elder&quot; () is believed to live in the lake. If anyone should meet him, then he is believed to ask: &quot;Is Tallinn ready yet?&quot;. If then the other person answered &quot;yes&quot;, then he would flood the city, and so according to the myth, the necessary response is &quot;No, there is much to be done yet&quot;.

<doc id="1169760" wikidata="Q7875025" url="?curid=1169760" title="USS Vandalia (1828)">
<text>The first Vandalia was an 18-gun sloop-of-war in the United States Navy during the Second Seminole War and the American Civil War. She was named for the city of Vandalia, Illinois.

==Service history==
&quot;Vandalia&quot; was laid down at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1825; launched in 1828; and commissioned on 6 November of that year, Commander John Gallagher in command.

===Brazil Squadron, 1828–1831===
&quot;Vandalia&quot; left Philadelphia on 16 December 1828, bound for duty with the Brazil Squadron off the eastern seaboard of South America. She remained off the coasts of Brazil and Argentina for the next three years, during a period of political unrest on the continent of South America. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 18 December 1831; was decommissioned the next day.

===West Indies Squadron, 1832–1839===
&quot;Vandalia&quot; remained inactive until 4 October 1832 when she was recommissioned for service with the West Indies Squadron. &quot;Vandalia&quot; again put into Norfolk in August 1834 and was decommissioned there on the 24th for major repairs. Recommissioned on the last day of the year, she joined the West Indies Squadron in January 1835 and served with that organization into the summer of 1838; cooperating with land forces in Florida during the Second Seminole War; and helping to suppress piracy and the slave trade. After almost three months laid up undergoing repairs from 30 August to 24 November, the ship was reactivated and returned to duty for a year in the Caribbean. Nearing five years in its current service, and now being unseaworthy, it returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where her commissioning pennant was again hauled down at Norfolk on 23 November 1839.

===Home Squadron, 1842–1845===
Following more than two years on the stocks, the ship was returned to commission on 3 February 1842, joined the newly created Home Squadron in 1842, and performed routine patrol and reconnaissance duties at scattered points as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as the mouth of the Amazon River. During a visit to Haiti in the early spring of 1845, an epidemic of yellow fever broke out in the ship. She returned immediately to Norfolk, was decommissioned on 30 April, and was laid up.

===Pacific Squadron, 1849–1852===
During the sloop&#x27;s period in ordinary which lasted until 1849, she was lengthened by 13 feet in 1848. The renovated &quot;Vandalia&quot; was re-commissioned on 9 August 1849 and joined the Pacific Squadron on 5 September 1849 as that organization was expanding to service the territory which the United States had recently acquired on the Pacific coast. She made several visits to the Hawaiian Islands in 1851 before returning to the New York Navy Yard on 6 October 1852 and going out of commission again on the 14th.

===East Indies Squadron, 1853–1856===
&quot;Vandalia&#x27;s&quot; rest ended on 14 February 1853, and the ship soon joined Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s East India Squadron. She was present as part of Perry&#x27;s forces during his second visit to Japan on 13 February 1854, which resulted in the Treaty of Kanagawa opening Japanese ports to American ships. In 1855 she helped to protect American interests in China during the Taiping Rebellion. &quot;Vandalia&quot; was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 30 September 1856.

===Pacific Squadron, 1857–1860===
&quot;Vandalia&quot; was recommissioned on 11 November 1857 for duty with the Pacific Squadron. In 1859, the warship rescued survivors of the American clipper ship &quot;Wild Wave&quot;, wrecked off Oeno Island in the Pitcairn Islands, and conducted an expedition against natives at Waya Island, Fiji, following the murder of two American citizens. &quot;Vandalia&quot; returned to the New York Navy Yard early in 1860 and was decommissioned on 6 January of that year. Commodore Matthew C. Perry, leader of the East Indies Squadron died on 4 March 1858 a year after his return to the U.S. The last known survivor of the Vandalia&#x27;s crew to have been present at the Taiping Rebellion, and the &quot;opening&quot; of Japan in 1854 was Able Seaman Patrick C. McFadden. A native of Ireland, he died in Canton, Illinois 16 February 1901.

===Civil War, 1860–1863===
&quot;Vandalia&quot; was recommissioned on 8 November 1860 and assigned to duty with the East Indies Squadron with Captain Samuel P. Lee commanding. With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, &quot;Vandalia&quot; was called back home and assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 31 May for blockade duty off Charleston and Bull&#x27;s Bay, South Carolina. There, she captured the schooner &quot;Henry Middleton&quot; on 21 August and assisted in the capture of the sailing ship &quot;Thomas Watson&quot; on 15 October. The vessel also participated in the successful amphibious assault upon Roanoke Island, North Carolina, on 7 and 8 November. This victory closed the supply lines to Confederate-held Norfolk Navy Yard and was largely responsible for the evacuation of that vital naval facility six months later. &quot;Vandalia&quot; put into New York on 24 November to deliver the officers and crew of the wrecked steamer &quot;Governor&quot;.

&quot;Vandalia&quot; soon returned to duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and was deployed off Tybee Roads, Georgia, in December. She remained at Tybee until April 1862, at which time she was ordered to proceed to the blockade at Wassaw Sound, Georgia. The sloop returned to Port Royal, South Carolina, in late June and took up blockade duty off Charleston in July. She served at Port Royal as a guardship in September and was repaired and resupplied there in November. Later that month and in December, she cruised along the outside line of the blockade off Charleston and Port Royal Bay, performing reconnaissance duties as well as giving practical sailing experience to recent Naval Academy graduates. On 29 December, the vessel was ordered north for major structural repairs at New York, having sprung a leak under her magazine.

&quot;Vandalia&quot; was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 4 February 1863 and then sailed for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 17 October for use as a receiving and guard ship. She remained at Portsmouth until broken up there sometime between 1870 and 1872.

<doc id="1169761" wikidata="Q3026109" url="?curid=1169761" title="Diamond v. Chakrabarty">
<text>Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with whether living organisms can be patented. Writing for a five-justice majority, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger held that human-made bacteria could be patented under the patent laws of the United States because such an invention constituted a &quot;manufacture&quot; or &quot;composition of matter&quot;. Justice William J. Brennan Jr., along with Justices Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F. Powell Jr., dissented from the Court&#x27;s ruling, arguing that because Congress had not expressly authorized the patenting of biological organisms, the Court should not extend patent law to cover them.

In the decades since the Court&#x27;s ruling, the case has been recognized as a landmark case for U.S. patent law, with industry and legal commentators identifying it as a turning point for the biotechnology industry.

==Background==

Genetic engineer Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty, working for General Electric, developed a bacterium (derived from the &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genus and now known as &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot;) capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills. General Electric filed a patent application for the bacterium in the United States listing Chakrabarty as the inventor, but the application was rejected by a patent examiner, because under patent law at that time, living things were generally understood to not be patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.

General Electric and Chakrabarty appealed the examiner&#x27;s decision to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. The Board however agreed with the examiner that the bacterium was not patentable under current law. General Electric and Chakrabarty thereafter appealed the Board&#x27;s decision to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. This time, General Electric and Chakrabarty prevailed with the court overturning the examiner&#x27;s decision and holding &quot;the fact that micro-organisms are alive is without legal significance for purposes of the patent law.&quot; The Patent Office, in the name of its Commissioner, Sidney A. Diamond, appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court opinion==

The Supreme Court heard oral argument from the parties on March 17, 1980 and issued its decision on June 16, 1980. In a 5–4 ruling, the Court ruled in favor of Chakrabarty and affirmed the decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger began by noting that 35 U.S.C. § 101 allowed inventors to obtain patents for a &quot;manufacture&quot; or &quot;composition of matter&quot;. The majority noted that while these words indicated that Congress intended for the patent laws to be given a &quot;broad scope&quot;, this scope was not unlimited and that, under the Court&#x27;s precedents, &quot;laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas&quot; were not patentable. However, the Court held that these precedents were inapplicable to Chakrabarty&#x27;s case as he was not trying to patent a &quot;natural phenomena&quot; but rather a human-made bacterium that he, himself, had developed. The majority contrasted this outcome with the one reached nearly 50 years prior in &quot;Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.&quot;, where the Court had rejected a patent application for the discovery of a naturally occurring bacterium that could be used to improve crops. Unlike the patentee in &quot;Funk Bros.&quot;, the Supreme Court here held that Chakrabarty had not merely discovered the bacteria&#x27;s existence, he had created it himself and adapted it to a particular purpose.
Justice William J. Brennan Jr., joined by Justices Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F. Powell Jr., dissented from the Court&#x27;s ruling. Looking at the legislative history of the patent laws, Justice Brennan concluded that Congress had demonstrated an intent to exclude living organisms from the scope of the country&#x27;s patent laws. Justice Brennan also expressed concern that the Court was extending patent protections into areas not expressly authorized by Congress and that this constituted an inappropriate extension of monopoly patent power.

==Impact==
In the decades following the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, commentators have classified &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot; as an important legal decision, particularly with respect to the patent laws and the biotechnology industry. In 2018, &quot;Time&quot; identified the decision as one of 25 important moments in American history, with Professor Gerardo Con Diaz remarking that the decision allowed &quot;inventors at private and public institutions alike to obtain patents for genetically modified organisms — from plants and animals for laboratory research, to many foods available in supermarkets today&quot; and allowed biotechnology firms to protect their developments in new ways. Writing for &quot;IP Watchdog&quot; on the decision&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Gene Quinn called the decision a &quot;turning point for the biotech industry&quot; and praised the Court&#x27;s ruling as &quot;emblematic of the need for an expansive view of what is patentable subject matter.&quot; Likewise, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization praised the decision as being &quot;instrumental in spurring the creation of a dynamic and flourishing biotech industry.&quot; &quot;Nature&quot; similarly noted that, at least according to industry participants, &quot;without &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot;, commercial biotechnology based on recombinant DNA technologies would not exist today.&quot;

However, the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling has also attracted some criticism from scholars who believe the Court extended patent law in a way that Congress did not authorize. Writing in the Ohio State Law Journal, Frank Darr criticized the Court&#x27;s decision as containing &quot;serious interpretive problems&quot; and &quot;reflect[ing] a policy choice&quot; by the majority rather than a neutral legal analysis.

==Further criticisms==
George Mason University&#x27;s Center for Intellectual Property and Innovation Policy has pointed out that, in the wake of &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty,&quot; the courts have continued to affirm the right of biotech industry developers to continue to claim ownership of altered biological life, while clarifying some limits in &quot;Mayo v. Prometheus&quot; and &quot;AMP v. Myriad.&quot; The Center has expressed concern over what may be interpreted as judicial activism, with this ambitious legal thrust in advance of Congressional ability to thoughtfully consider appropriate legislation.

While cases subsequent to &quot;Chakrabarty&quot; have provided some safeguards, such as forbidding the patenting of &quot;limited DNA sequences,&quot; concerns have arisen that these safeguards do not go far enough, and that &quot;biopiracy&quot; of the human genome could take place, especially in an era of global health crisis demanding a rapid pharmaceutical response. A legal collaboration at the University of Pittsburgh suggests that it &quot;is a stretch&quot; to label such presumptuous genomic editing as outright slavery. However, as such editing in its most contemporary form may include the insertion of what has been termed by the industry as an entire &quot;operating platform,&quot; concerns may continue.

<text>Freedom Fighters is a 2003 third-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and Windows. It was developed by IO Interactive and published by Electronic Arts.

The game is set in an alternate history in which the Soviet Union has invaded and occupied New York City. The player takes the role of Christopher Stone, a plumber turned resistance movement leader, fighting against the invaders.

The Windows version of the game was re-released digitally on September 21, 2020, by IO Interactive on Steam, GOG.com, and Epic Games Store. Included in the purchase of the re-release is the full &quot;Official Freedom Fighters soundtrack&quot; together with 2 bonus tracks that were never included in the game.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; is a third-person shooter, in which the player navigates through the streets of New York with a controllable squad of teammates while fighting the occupying Soviet forces. The player gains charisma points by performing various deeds, such as capturing a base or destroying enemy supplies. The more charisma gained, the more squad mates the character can recruit, up to a maximum of twelve. The player can direct recruits by giving them simple orders such as &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, and &quot;defend&quot;.

===Multiplayer===
The console versions&#x27; multiplayer revolves around securing flags and bunkers. The flag is usually in the center of the map. Bunkers are positioned around the map, and spawn either Soviet soldiers or American freedom fighters. A game can host up to four players via split-screen who may choose between the Soviet and American sides. Each side has a different set of weapons which the players can switch during battle. The players&#x27; charisma meters are set to eight, so each player can have a maximum of eight soldiers under their command; however, if it is a four-player battle, each player can control a maximum of four soldiers. The PC version does not support multiplayer.

==Plot==
The Soviet Union became a world superpower by dropping the first atomic bomb on Berlin, ending World War II, and propping up communist states throughout the globe which begin to surround the US in the present day. New York plumbing brothers Chris and Troy Stone travel to meet with their next client, an activist named Isabella Angelina, only to find her apartment abandoned. The Soviet Union launches a surprise invasion of New York City and suddenly Soviet soldiers, led by General Vasilij Tatarin, seize Troy. Amidst the attack, Chris escapes to the streets, encountering a man named Mr. Jones and resistance member Phil Bagzton and Dihn &quot;The Kid&quot; Nguyen. After rescuing Isabella from a police station and Troy from a post office, the group retreats to the sewers and sets up a base of operations as New York is lost, with the media now being controlled by the Soviet Union.

Months later, Chris, Phil, and Isabella sabotage key Soviet facilities and reclaim areas within the city, building up a resistance group of New York citizens and disillusioned Soviet soldiers. Chris becomes known as the &quot;Freedom Phantom&quot; within the Soviet-controlled media network, SAFN. Troy is captured by Soviet troops and tortured for information. Forced into issuing a public statement aimed at the resistance to cease their actions, he breaks from the prepared text and urges Chris to continue fighting. In response, General Tatarin has Troy taken to Fort Jay and executes him personally. Mr. Jones suggests assassinating Tatarin in retaliation. Chris succeeds, but returns to find Isabella missing and the resistance base occupied by the Soviet Army. The operation was orchestrated by Mr. Jones who reveals himself to be KGB agent Colonel Mikael Bulba. It is revealed that his purpose for helping the Resistance the whole time was to kill Tatarin and take his rank. Chris escapes with Phil and others to a new underground area while SAFN reports on the death of Tatarin, Colonel Bulba&#x27;s promotion to General, and the &quot;end&quot; of the resistance in New York.

During the winter, Chris leads the resistance deeper into occupied New York, culminating with a major raid on SAFN Studios. Chris uses the station to send a broadcast encouraging the city and beyond to rise up and bring an end to the Soviet occupation. A final assault on Governors Island, consisting of massed resistance forces, is planned and carried out, capturing key objectives against extremely heavy Soviet resistance. Realizing he has lost, Bulba angrily leaves New York in a helicopter while lamenting that demotion is inevitable for him because of this failure. After capturing Fort Jay and rescuing Isabella, New York is liberated for the time being as Chris and the group solemnly celebrate their victory. Chris knows the Soviets will not give up the occupied United States easily, but resolves to fight on as long as is necessary.

==Development==
In 2002, EA Games officially announced &quot;Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Island&quot;, which would later be renamed &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot;, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The concept for the game originally involved a turn-based strategic mode as a major element of gameplay. Developed using the Glacier 3D engine, &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; was released in Australia and New Zealand on September 25 and in the United Kingdom on September 26. In North America, the release was delayed by one week to October 1 at the request of retailers in the region. 

===Audio===
The &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; original soundtrack was composed by Jesper Kyd and released on September 29, 2003, by Sumthing Else Music Works and Nano Studios.

Tracks 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 14 and 16 feature the Hungarian Radio Choir, with Russian lyrics written by Gaelle Obiegly.

==Reception==
&quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; received &quot;generally positive&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator outlets Metacritic and GameRankings. It was praised for having an excellent AI for squad tactics, which served to enhance the sense of immersion in the &quot;extremely detailed&quot; environments and maintain the illusion of working with a team. The game&#x27;s sound quality was also of note, both for the realistic combat noises and the game&#x27;s Russian-influenced music, which &quot;adds a perfect level of drama to the proceedings.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube game of September 2003.

Critics noted that while the game &quot;does a marvelous job&quot; of creating a realistic environment, the story was lacking in substance and fairly predictable, and while the squad AI is good, the enemy AI was lacking. Another source of criticism was the game&#x27;s length. The game can be cleared relatively quickly, but offers little replay value. According to Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;The only real problem with &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; is that there simply isn&#x27;t enough of it.&quot;

==Sequel==
On April 6, 2004, Eidos Interactive revealed plans for the sequel. Eidos announced it would distribute the sequel in the latter part of 2005. However, IO Interactive announced development of a new game, &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men&quot;, casting the future of a &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; sequel in doubt.

In 2010, when asked about a potential sequel, &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days&quot; director Karsten Lund refused to comment. In 2011, IO Interactive&#x27;s official Twitter account tweeted that &quot;Freedom Fighters 2&quot; is &quot;definitely something a lot of us are interested in doing&quot;. In 2017, IO Interactive split from Square Enix and took with them the rights to &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; since it was published before the Eidos buyout.

<text>In politics, a candidate or party&#x27;s base or core support refers to the voters who support them for elected office based on core values. On the left-right political spectrum, left-leaning bases tend to be liberal while right-leaning bases tend to be conservative. In the United States, high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party&#x27;s base in order to gain the party&#x27;s nomination and thus be guaranteed ballot access. In the case of legislative elections, base voters often prefer to support their party&#x27;s candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party&#x27;s chances of gaining a majority in the legislature.

<doc id="1169767" wikidata="Q412529" url="?curid=1169767" title="Rimonabant">
<text>Rimonabant (also known as SR141716; trade names Acomplia, Zimulti) is an anorectic antiobesity drug approved in Europe in 2006 but was withdrawn worldwide in 2008 due to serious psychiatric side effects; it was never approved in the United States. Rimonabant is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and was first-in-class for clinical development.

==History==

Rimonabant is a selective CB1 receptor blocker and was discovered and developed by Sanofi-Aventis.

On 21 June 2006, the European Commission approved the sale of rimonabant in the then-25-member European Union as a prescription drug for use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, or patients with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia. It was first in its class to be approved anywhere in the world.

Rimonabant was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in the United States in 2005; in 2007, the FDA&#x27;s Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval. The application was deemed &quot;not-approvable&quot; by FDA, and the company cancelled plans for a re-submission.

The drug was approved in Brazil in April 2007.

In October 2008, the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of Acomplia after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia outweighed its benefits due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems, including suicide. In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide. The EMA approval was withdrawn in January 2009. In 2009 India prohibited the manufacture and sale of the drug.

==Adverse effects==
Data from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal individuals. Data from a large, randomized, clinical trial (CRESCENDO) with &gt; 9,000 patients receiving rimonabant treatment demonstrated a rate of psychiatric adverse events (anxiety, depression, depressed mood, or insomnia) of greater than 30%.

Additionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common adverse effects (occurring in more than 10% of people); common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included gastroenteritis, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling.

The FDA&#x27;s advisory committee concurred with concerns raised by the review divisions. Based on human and on animal data, it appeared that the therapeutic window with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was narrow.

EMA postmarketing surveillance data suggested that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Rimonabant is an inverse agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Originally thought to be selective for the CB1 receptor, rimonabant was subsequently also found to act as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor.

==Chemistry==
The chemical synthesis of rimonabant is described as follows:

== Research ==
Along with the clinical trials in obesity that generated the data submitted to regulatory authorities, rimonabant was also studied in clinical trials for diabetes, atherosclerosis, and smoking cessation.

<doc id="1169777" wikidata="Q503494" url="?curid=1169777" title="Cobbler (food)">
<text>Cobbler is a dessert consisting of a fruit (or less commonly savory) filling poured into a large baking dish and covered with a batter, biscuit, or dumpling (in the United Kingdom) before being baked. Cobbler is part of the cuisine of the United Kingdom and United States, and is similar to a crumble or a crisp. However, traditional cobbler differs from both of these by the presence of a leavening agent such as baking powder or baking soda. Cobblers made in this way can be viewed as a hybrid of pie and cake. Some cobbler recipes, especially in the American South, resemble a thick-crusted, deep-dish pie with both a top and bottom crust that lack leavening and are less cake-like.

==Origin==
Cobblers originated in the British American colonies. English settlers were unable to make traditional suet puddings due to lack of suitable ingredients and cooking equipment, so instead covered a stewed filling with a layer of uncooked plain biscuits, scone batter or dumplings, fitted together. The origin of the name &quot;cobbler&quot;, recorded from 1859, is uncertain: it may be related to the archaic word &quot;cobeler&quot;, meaning &quot;wooden bowl&quot;, or the term may be due to the topping having the visual appearance of a &#x27;cobbled&#x27; stone pathway. The verb &quot;cobble&quot; means to assemble from available parts, which can be used to describe using scraps of pie crust or leftover scone or biscuit to combine with whatever filling or fruit was readily available.

==Varieties==
Note that crisp and crumble differ from the cobbler in that the former&#x27;s top layers may also include rolled oats made with oatmeal.

===North America===

Grunts, pandowdy, and slumps are Canadian Maritimes, New England and Pennsylvania Dutch (Apple Pan Dowdy) varieties of cobbler, typically cooked on the stovetop, or in an iron skillet or pan, with the dough on top in the shape of dumplings. They reportedly take their name from the grunting sound they make while cooking. Another name for the types of biscuits or dumplings used is &quot;dough-boys&quot;. Dough-boys are used in stews and cobblers alike.

In the United States, additional varieties of cobbler include the apple pan dowdy (an apple cobbler whose crust has been broken and perhaps stirred back into the filling), the Betty (see below), the buckle (made with yellow batter [like cake batter] with the filling mixed in with the batter), the dump (or dump cake), the grump, the slump, and the sonker. The sonker is unique to North Carolina: it is a deep-dish version of the American cobbler.

Cobblers most commonly come in single fruit varieties and are named as such, e.g. blackberry, blueberry, and peach cobbler. The tradition also gives the option of topping the fruit cobbler with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream. Savory cobblers are less common in the region; for example, tomato cobbler, which may include onion and a biscuit topping that may include cheese or cornmeal, is one savory variant that also resembles Southern tomato pie. Old California orchard cuisine features peach, pear, apricot, and, most prized by many, Black Tartarian cherry cobblers.

The Texas Legislature designated peach cobbler as the official cobbler of Texas in 2013.

====Betty====
The American variant known as the Betty or brown Betty dates from at least the early 19th century. In 1864, in the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;, it appeared with &quot;brown&quot; in lower case, thus making &quot;Betty&quot; the proper name. In 1890, however, a recipe was published in &quot;Practical Sanitary and Economic Cooking Adapted to Persons of Moderate and Small Means&quot; with the word &quot;Brown&quot; capitalized, rendering &quot;Brown Betty&quot; the proper name.

Brown Betties are made with breadcrumbs (or bread pieces, or graham cracker crumbs), and fruit, usually diced apples, in alternating layers. They are baked covered and have a consistency like bread pudding.

In the midwestern United States, &quot;apple Betty&quot; is often a synonym for &quot;apple crisp&quot;.

===UK and Commonwealth===

In the UK and Commonwealth of Nations, the scone-topped cobbler predominates, and is found in both sweet and savory versions. Common sweet fillings include apple, blackberry, and peach. Savory versions, such as beef, lamb, or mutton, consist of a casserole filling, sometimes with a simple ring of cobbles around the edge, rather than a complete layer, to aid cooking of the meat. Cheese or herb scones may also be used as a savory topping.

Cobblers and crumbles were promoted by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War, since they are filling, yet require less butter than a traditional pastry, and can be made with margarine.

<text>WUFT (channel 5) is a PBS member television station in Gainesville, Florida, United States. It is owned by the University of Florida alongside low-power weather-formatted independent station WRUF-LD (channel 10), NPR member WUFT-FM (89.1), and commercial radio stations WRUF (850 AM) and WRUF-FM (103.7). The five stations share studios at Weimer Hall on the university&#x27;s campus; WUFT&#x27;s transmitter is located on Northwest 53rd Avenue in Gainesville.

WUFT serves 16 counties in north-central Florida. For decades, it has also been available on cable in Jacksonville, currently on Comcast Xfinity channel 25, providing a second choice for PBS programming alongside WJCT (which signed on two months before WUFT).

==History==
WUFT first signed on the air with instructional programming on November 10, 1958, becoming the third educational television station in Florida.

The station was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the FCC&#x27;s plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were 12 VHF channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only 12 VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.

After the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one non-commercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (&quot;1/2&quot;) would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as &quot;UHF islands&quot; since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The &quot;2&quot; networks became CBS and NBC, &quot;+1&quot; represented non-commercial educational stations, and &quot;1/2&quot; became ABC (which was the weakest network usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available).

However, what would become of the Gainesville market is sandwiched between Jacksonville (channels 4, 7, and 12) to the northeast, Tallahassee (channels 6 and 11) to the northwest, and Orlando (channels 2, 6, and 9) and Tampa Bay (channels 3, 8, 10, and 13) to the south. This created a large &quot;doughnut&quot; in north-central Florida where there could only be &quot;one&quot; VHF license. WUFT was fortunate enough to gain that license, and as a result, Gainesville became unique in that a public television station was the market&#x27;s oldest television station (Gainesville&#x27;s first commercial television station, WCJB-TV, did not sign on until 1971).

WUFT rebranded in August 2010, calling itself &quot;Florida&#x27;s 5&quot;; this rebranding lasted until late November 2019, when the station began identifying by its callsign again, in alignment with PBS&#x27; 50th-anniversary logo redesign.

==Newscasts==

WUFT-TV broadcasts local newscasts staffed and produced by students in the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. WUFT-TV broadcasts two main newscasts, along with a variety of special reports and half-hour specials. &quot;First Edition&quot;, currently a six-minute newscast, airs weekdays at noon for 100 shows per year. &quot;WUFT News – First at 5:00&quot; (the main newscast, formerly known as &quot;Report 5&quot; and &quot;Evening News&quot;) is a half-hour weekday newscast at 5 p.m. which airs 200+ days per year. Starting in the spring of 2014, WUFT-TV added a 6 p.m. newscast, that is also 30 minutes long, but that has since been canceled, leaving just the 5 p.m. news. Before the move to 5 p.m., the newscast used to be on at its long-time home at 5:30 p.m., to possibly avoid competing against ABC affiliate WCJB. When it was moved to 5 p.m., the same reason existed.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
WUFT is the only PBS member station in Florida not to carry the national 24/7 PBS Kids network on one of its subchannels.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUFT ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using virtual channel 5.

As part of the SAFER Act, WUFT kept its analog signal on the air until June 29 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<text>El Capitan () is a peak in Culberson County, Texas, located within Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The 10th-highest peak in Texas at 8,085 ft (2,464 m), El Capitan is part of the Guadalupe Mountains, an exposed portion of a Permian period reef uplifted and exposed by tectonic activity during the late Cretaceous period. The southern terminus of the Guadalupe Mountains, El Capitan looms over U.S. 62/180, where its imposing height and stark outline have made it one of the iconic images of the Trans-Pecos to generations of travelers.

==Geology==

El Capitan is the southernmost peak of the Guadalupe escarpment, an ancient limestone reef that forms the present-day Guadalupe Mountains. These mountains are an exposed portion of the Capitan Reef Barrier, a 350-mile long reef constructed primarily from calcareous sponges, encrusting algae, such as stromatolites, and lime-rich mud directly from the ocean. This reef surrounded much of the Delaware Sea, an inland ocean that covered parts of modern southern New Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas in the Permian period (about 290 million years ago). Near the end of the late Permian period, in the Ochoan epoch, the outlet that allowed sea water to enter the inland waters began to silt over, occasionally closing the inland sea from its source. Mineral-rich and cut off from replenishment, the inland sea began to evaporate into layers of alternating gray anhydrite/gypsum, brown calcite, and halite, which formed the Castile Formation. As salt concentrations increased, laminated halite, anhydrite, sylvite, and polyhalite formed the Salado Formation, which eventually covered and grew beyond the lower Castile Formation.

By the end of the Ochoan, these deposits had filled the roughly 1,800-ft-deep basin and covered the reef with dry land. Red silt and sand deposited by rivers crossing these new lands eventually formed the dolomitic Rustler Formation, and the Dewey Lake Formation, burying the reef even deeper. The Capitan Reef stayed buried for over 150 million years, until the late Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era (80 million years ago), when tectonic activity associated with the Laramide Orogeny caused a significant uplift in the area and created a major fault line, the Border Fault, in the area west of the Delaware Basin. Exposing the Guadalupe Mountains area of the reef, the impact of this tectonic event can be clearly seen in the difference in height between the towering El Capitan and the adjacent salt flat graben, vertically driven 1,000 feet apart by the uplift. Once exposed, the natural forces of wind and rain slowly stripped away the softer sediments, further uncovering the ancient reef and revealing the sheer limestone walls of the Guadalupe Mountains.

==Human history==
Deep in the Chihuahuan Desert, the area around El Capitan is composed of rugged mountains and wind-swept salt flats. As a result, most of the Native American presence in the vicinity was centered around 3 miles southeast of El Capitan in the area now called Pine Springs. An oasis of springs, seeps, and vegetation, this area exhibits evidence (mescal dumps, petroglyphs, artifacts, etc.) of human occupation for several centuries. Most recently, the area was a seasonal home to bands of the Mescalero Apache, who, steadily pushed south by the fiercely expansionist Comanche in the 18th century, used their local knowledge of springs and other scarce resources to maintain themselves in an otherwise harsh environment well into the 19th century, when Anglo expansion and settlement ended their delicately balanced way of life.

While the occasional Spanish expedition, such as that of Antonio de Espejo in 1582, came close to the area around El Capitan, permanent Anglo-European presence in the area dates from the late 1840s, when the region officially became a part of the United States after the American victory in the Mexican–American War. Eager to find a suitable trail from San Antonio to El Paso, and eventually the far-flung American territories on the Pacific coast, a number of expeditions pushed into the hot, dry, dangerous lands west of the Pecos, hoping to find a potential wagon route with enough timber and water to make consistent travel possible. One of the expeditions, led by Indian Agent Robert S. Neighbors, made its way to El Paso in 1849 through a difficult journey that required crossing and recrossing the Pecos and Devil&#x27;s Rivers, and then surviving the long, dry stretch from the Davis Mountains to El Paso. Dismayed at the prospect of returning by the same route, the party instead struck off east from El Paso towards the Hueco Tanks and Guadalupe Pass, which they hoped to follow to an established crossing of the Pecos River near the modern Texas-New Mexico border long used by Mexicans and Native Americans. Successful in reaching the Pecos, Neighbors quickly descended the river and made his way back to San Antonio, where he reported to his superiors that this route offered good water at Hueco Tanks, good timber near the mountains, and an easy path through Guadalupe Pass to the Pecos. This road, which became known as the &quot;upper&quot; road, to distinguish itself from the original &quot;lower&quot; road through Fort Davis and up the Rio Grande to El Paso, soon became popular among traders and emigrants, their long trains of wagons and mules passing near the brooding face of El Capitan. This traffic increased in 1858 as the Butterfield Stagecoach began to use the upper road between El Paso and the ford on the Pecos called Pope’s Crossing, after John Pope, the Army officer who had surveyed the crossing two years before. Taking advantage of the water and timber available, the stagecoach line constructed a station at the Pinery, later called Pine Springs, 3 miles southeast of El Capitan. Though this station only lasted a year before the route was moved south to come under the protection of Forts Stockton and Davis, the Pinery station continued to be used by soldiers, freighters, and emigrants long after.
During this period, El Capitan also bore witness to the El Paso Salt War, a violent struggle between Mexican-American residents and Anglo businessmen over access to the salt flats extending west from the base of the mountain. Long known to the Apache, the salt flats were first identified by Europeans in 1692 by the expedition of Diego de Vargas. Quickly becoming an important local resource, generations of Mexicans, and later, Mexican-Americans, braved the hot, dangerous, four-day trail from San Elizario on the Rio Grande to the Hueco Mountains and then east towards El Capitan to fill their wagons with the precious salt. This all changed in the late 1840s, when the region began to have a larger Anglo presence. While Mexican law and tradition had held the salt flats as communal property, American tradition considered them unclaimed lands, which could be claimed by any citizen and purchased as private property. By the 1870s, attempts by local businessmen to claim the salt flats were being met with violent opposition by local residents, for whom the free salt was an important adjunct to the regional economy of farming and ranching. The conflict came to a head in December 1877, when Charles Howard, who had attempted to claim the salt flats, and two colleagues were murdered by an angry mob. This quickly led to widespread violence against local Mexican-American families, leading many to flee south of the Rio Grande. By the time the dust had settled, the salt flats had been claimed and local residents were forced to pay for the salt that for centuries had been free.

By the early decades of the 20th century, an all-weather road had been constructed between El Paso and Carlsbad, New Mexico. Commissioned in 1928 as U.S. Highway 62, the road brought a new generation of visitors to the area, particularly after the opening of nearby Carlsbad Caverns National Park in 1930. Decades before the creation of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, travelers by car and bus were already stopping at roadside rest stops to marvel at the sheer sides of El Capitan, take pictures, and write quick messages on the backs of postcards emblazoned with the mountain’s imposing face.
During this period, the land that included El Capitan was owned by James Adolphus Williams, whose Williams Ranch house is still extant on park land west of the mountain. After several economic setbacks, Williams sold the land in 1941 to Judge J.C. Hunter of Van Horn, Texas, a prosperous oilman and early conservationist whose Guadalupe Mountains Ranch eventually included 75,000 acres of land in the Guadalupes, including parts of McKittrick Canyon. An early advocate for establishing a park to protect the southern Guadalupes, Hunter campaigned for several years until his death in 1945. Inheriting his father’s desire to see the area protected, both for its scenic beauty and geological significance, Hunter&#x27;s son, J.C. Hunter Jr., worked with officials of the National Park Service to construct a deal that would enable the Park Service to purchase the land for use as a national park. Forced to run a tortuous gauntlet of state and federal legislators, park officials, and road engineers, as well as property owners and local ranchers, the Hunter donation, which included El Capitan and Guadalupe Peak, was finally deeded over to the Park Service in 1969. Three years later, Guadalupe Mountains National Park was officially opened, allowing public access to the area.
==Access==
As previously noted, El Capitan is located within the boundaries of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, a fee-area located on U.S. Highway 62/180 between Carlsbad and El Paso. The southern terminus of the Guadalupe range, El Capitan is guarded by cliffs on three sides, and those faces are rarely climbed due to the unstable condition of the rock and the sheer nature of the peak. While no trail to the summit has been developed, hikers can climb up to the top of El Capitan by first climbing to near the summit of Guadalupe Peak on the developed 4.5-mile Guadalupe Peak Trail, scrambling down to the south onto the Guadalupe Peak-El Capitan saddle, and then hiking up the back of El Capitan to the summit.

<doc id="1169818" wikidata="Q383738" url="?curid=1169818" title="Oropom people">
<text>The Oropom (also known as Iworopom, Oworopom, Oyoropom or Oropoi) were the aboriginal inhabitants of much of Karamoja in Uganda, Mt. Elgon area and West Pokot, Trans Nzoia and Turkana regions in Kenya. Their descendants were largely assimilated into various communities present in their former territories, including the Iteso, Karamojong, Pokot, Turkana and Bukusu. They are or were found in scattered pockets between the Turkwel River, Chemorongit Mountains and Mt. Elgon. One report indicates that they formerly spoke the unclassified Oropom language.

==Sources==
The first indication of the past existence of a people known as Oropom was through fieldwork done by J.G.Wilson in the mid-20th century. While resident in Karamoja region of Uganda, he came across widespread and abundant archaeological material including stone tools and pottery of a nature also found in Karasuk, Turkana and West Pokot districts in Kenya. Wilson noted that &quot;the material collected, particularly the pottery, reflects such a high degree of skill and artistry in its manufacture, that it is obviously not connected with the much cruder pots of the present occupants of these areas&quot;. His supposition was confirmed by most residents who had no traditions indicating the manufacture of the items save for a few people who claimed to be descendants of a people known as Oropom.

==Origins==
According to Webster, the Oropom nursery was located near Mt. Moroto, from which they moved west to the plain between Napak and Mount Elgon.

Oropom traditions recorded by Wilson capture the extent of their ancient territories: the whole Turkana to a point east of Lake Turkana which the Oropom called &quot;Malimalte&quot;, the Cherangani Hills eastward to Lake Baringo, much of the Trans-Nzoia District - all in present-day Kenya; Mt. Elgon and all of Teso sub-region in Uganda; as well as the areas of Didinga and Topossa in Sudan.

==Assimilation==

It is currently assumed that the Oropom were the original inhabitants of their territory, and that successive waves of migrants invaded the territory;

Wilson suggests that the first invaders of the Oropom territory were proto-Kalenjin speakers who may have included the Nyangea, Teuso and Tepes.
They were followed by the Maliri who had occupied with certainty what are now Jie country and large parts of Dodoth country in Uganda. It is estimated that their arrival in those districts occurred 600 to 800 years ago (i.e. c.1200 to 1400 AD)
The oropom were assimilated into various Karimojong groups as clans (Aspects of Karimojong ethnography- Fr. Noveli)

==Society==
===Appearance===
Wilson (1970) noted that some individuals living among the Karimojong and who claimed Oropom ancestry could be distinguished by their reddish brown skin, &quot;peppercorn hair&quot;, slanted eyes, and prominent cheekbones. On this basis he ascribed them to the Khoisan group.

In 1970, their main mark was a custom of wearing a single cowrie shell attached to a forelock placed over the centre of the forehead (for women), or an indented mark in the centre of the forehead (for men.)

===Housing===
Traditions also captured by Wilson note that the Oropom had well-built houses of three to four rooms (unlike the Karamojong), big gardens, and long-horned cattle. They also had a reputation as good potters, and pottery attributed to them is found all over the area.

===Clothing===
The women wore skin clothing and large earrings, and did not plait their hair; the men wore nothing but a belt covering their penis, and had long pigtails. Both sexes wore many bangles, and covered themselves in a red oil-ochre mixture.

===Industry===
Wilson postulates that they had no knowledge of iron working as most of their tools and implements were Stone Age.

===Religion and customs===
Their religious rites are said to have invariably taken place at sunrise, usually on rock outcrops. Some involved animal sacrifices. Some were reserved for elders, while others were open to all. Ritual feasts were held at stone circles. Most accounts of the Oropom state that they did not practice circumcision as a rite of initiation .

==Pokotozek - Oropom conflict==
Oral traditions indicate that the expansion of Lwoo speakers into Acholi caused the breakaway of a group who were initially known as Jie. The Jie came from the vicinity of Gulu though there was a section of the group who came from a hill known as Got Turkan. The Jie who are said to have been Luo speaking though governed by elders and not chiefs (indicating that their culture was not fully Lwoo-ised), advanced eastward and entered the present Karamoja boundary at Adilang. The territory they entered was then occupied by the Maliri who were pushed to the vicinity of Koten mountains.

The Jie from Got Turkan, now calling themselves Turkana, broke away from the main Jie populace at Kotido and advanced eastward bringing extreme pressure to bear on the Maliri at Koten causing that group to split into two. One section came to be known as Merille while the other referred to themselves as Pokotozek.

The Pokotozek whose movements would have greatest impact on the Oropom, moved south, arriving at Nakiloro which lies on the lip of the Turkana escarpment just north of Moroto mountain, where they stayed for a short while before moving further south, proceeding down the eastern side of the Chemorongit and Cherangani mountains before finally branching off in the direction of Lake Baringo.

This incursion disturbed Oropom who were settled around Baringo, causing a break-up of that group which led to migrations in various directions;

===Turkwell===
Some Oropom moved towards the Turkwell, both below and above Turkwell gorge.

===Uasin Gishu===
Other Oropom moved into Uasin Gishu Maasai held territory. According to Maasai tradition, an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria communities attacked the Chemngal who then occupied the Plateau today known as Uasin Gishu.

A Karamojong informant noted in 1916 that Nandi occupied territory previously stretched as far north as the sources of the Nzoia River i.e. Mt. Elgon, a territory that had been occupied by the Nandi as lately as the time of the grandfathers of that generation (i.e early to mid-19th century).

The Karamojong raided the northern Nandi sections twice before the Nandi launched a big raid against them at Choo hill near the junction of Kanyangareng &amp; Turkwel rivers. The Masinko clan of Karamojong who were pasturing here counterattacked and successfully drove of the Nandi raiders.

In response to the Nandi raid, the Karimojong organized a powerful force to break up the Nandi nearest the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed but the expedition returned and reported that the Nandi had withdrawn too far south. The Karamojong were unmolested by the Nandi from that time and the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed became a no-mans land.

===Chemorongit===
Yet others moved to the Chemorongit mountains (Karasuk) which were still part of Oropom territory, as well as the area west of there and south of Moroto mountain.

The Pokotozek finding that they were no longer facing a formidable tribal grouping to the north and west of Baringo, themselves expanded in that direction, expelling other Oropom from the Cherangani mountains and further west right up to the slopes of Mt Elgon hence limiting Turkana southern movement.

It is notable that the emerging Sebei referred to the Mt Elgon Oropom as Sirikwa. The Sirikwa population at Mt Elgon, as evidenced by Sirkwa holes, was fairly dense and it is likely that their identity was still largely intact. It would take the Karimojong dispersion of the Oropom at Kapcheliba in the early 18th century to finally submerge the Oropom-Sirikwa identity.

==The Battle at Kacheliba==
A notable battle that occurred around 1825 or 1830 near Kacheliba is largely perceived to have signaled the snuffing out of Oropom identity. A notable element of the battle is the Oropom tying themselves together with leather ropes. Oropom descendants romanticise the encounter, noting that;

&quot;The Karimajong kept beating the Oropom and drove them further and further south. Finally the Oropom became tired of running. They began killing their cattle to make leather ropes out of their skins. They tied themselves together with those ropes so that none could run away. They said ‘we are tired of running – it is better that we should all die here together’&quot;

The Karimajong on the other hand provide a brutal military assessment of the encounter and the state of Oropom society at that point, they note that;

&quot;...Their shields were larger than ours but were ineffective as they were made of cowhide. Their spears were unlike ours, more like those of the Nandi. When we were strong enough we desired their cattle which had long horns, and we fought a great battle with them. However they were cowards and their elders had to force the young men to fight us; in doing this, they gathered them together in long lines, securing them one to the other by ropes, to prevent them running away. This was very foolish as when we killed one or two of them, the whole line collapsed with the weight of their bodies and we slaughtered them where they fell.&quot;

Some then fled east or south; a few Oropom settlements are claimed to have remained between Kacheliba and Karta as late as 1927. Some areas were unaffected by this battle, and Oropom remained between Lolachat and Namalu in Pian county in Nakapiripirit District, and in the area between Mt. Elgon and Mt. Kadam. Traditions of the Didinga people of South Sudan apparently record displacing a &quot;red&quot; people, called the Argit, who were skilled in pottery-making.

==Diaspora==
===Iteso===
Iteso clan names reveal a history of long-standing ethnic interactions and found amongst these are names of Bantu and Northern Nilotic origin. Some of these are clan names are said to be of Iworopom origin. Traditions recorded among the JoPadhola in Kenya indicate that there were two waves of Iteso settlement in their present lands. The first was family based and was peaceful. This was followed by an extensive and aggressive migration that left the Iteso in control of a large swathe of territory that by 1850 extended as far as the western highlands of Kenya.

A story collected by Turpin (1948) suggests that the Iteso are largely descended from the Oropom, a suggestion that has been advanced by many other historians. Karp notes that the Karamoja call the Southern Iteso &quot;Iworopom&quot;.

===Karimajong, Turkana &amp; Tepes===
Some Oropom fled northwards to join the Turkana and Tepes. People considering themselves Oropom were (as of 1970), according to Wilson, particularly concentrated within the Karamoja area in Matheniko and Jie counties, and to a lesser extent in Bokora; some were also found among the Tepes people of Mt. Moroto and Mt. Kadam. Others were found in Pian county, notably at Lorengedwat.

===Bukusu===
Other refugees swelled the Bukusu population where they led a distinctly different way of life within recorded memory.

===Uasin Gishu Maasai===
Some Oropom refugees fled eastward and found safe haven on the Uasin Gishu plateau where they have been strongly identified with the Uas Nkishu Maasai.

===Pokot===
Some refugees joined the Pokot

<doc id="1169822" wikidata="Q3268165" url="?curid=1169822" title="USS Greenfish">
<text>USS &quot;Greenfish&quot; (SS-351) was a submarine of the United States Navy. It was named for the greenfish.

&quot;Greenfish&quot; (SS-351) was launched by the Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut, 21 December 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas J. Doyle; and commissioned 7 June 1946.

&quot;Greenfish&quot;&#x27;s shakedown cruise 22 July to 13 September 1946, took her to Barranquilla, Colombia; the Canal Zone; Callao, Peru; and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. Exercises out of New London and in Chesapeake Bay carried her through the year, and the early months of 1947 found &quot;Greenfish&quot; back in the Caribbean for fleet exercises. On 11 February 1947 she effected one of the first transfers of personnel from an aircraft carrier, , to a submarine by helicopter.

Various exercises along the American coast and in the Caribbean occupied &quot;Greenfish&quot; until 8 January 1948, when she entered the Electric Boat Co. yards for a GUPPY II conversion. This included the installation of snorkeling equipment on &quot;Greenfish&quot;, enabling her to run her diesel engines while submerged, which required the enlargement of her &quot;sail&quot;. In addition, more batteries were installed to increase her submerged speed and permit the ship to remain completely submerged for longer periods.

Returning to New London 21 August 1948, &quot;Greenfish&quot; sailed on her &quot;second&quot; shakedown cruise 1 September, with Rear Admiral James J. Fife, Commander, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, aboard. She transited the Panama Canal 9 September and engaged in exercises at Balboa before returning to New London 24 September.

The new GUPPY submarine was attached to the Pacific Fleet, and sailed for Pearl Harbor 23 October. She reached her new home 25 November 1948. With the exception of ASW and harbor defense exercises in Puget Sound in 1950 and a subsequent Mare Island overhaul, &quot;Greenfish&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor on local exercises through 1951.

Departing Pearl Harbor 15 November 1951, &quot;Greenfish&quot; sailed to Yokosuka, Japan, for Korean War duty. After a patrol 31 January to 1 March 1952, She participated in exercises at Okinawa and then returned to Hawaii 2 June. Local and special operations filled her time until 5 November 1954, when she entered the Pearl Harbor Shipyard for another modernization overhaul.

&quot;Greenfish&quot;, overhaul completed 6 July 1955, sailed for deployment with the 7th Fleet 15 September and reached Yokosuka 29 September. From 19 October to 15 November she engaged in special operations, and then embarked on a tour of Southeast Asia. Ports visited by &quot;Greenfish&quot; during her 2-month cruise included Manila, Singapore, Rangoon, where she was the first submarine ever to visit and was inspected by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and Hong Kong. After further exercises off Okinawa and Yokosuka, &quot;Greenfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 13 March 1956.

The following 5 years fell into a pattern for Greenfish—local operations out of Pearl Harbor, special operations, exercises along the American coast, and periodic overhauls. &quot;Greenfish&quot; entered Pearl Harbor Shipyard 15 December 1960 for a FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul and extensive conversion to a GUPPY III class ship. This included cutting &quot;Greenfish&quot; in half and adding a section of hull to permit more batteries and other equipment.

Conversion completed, &quot;Greenfish&quot; departed 28 July 1961 for shakedown, operations at Pearl Harbor, and in December sailed to serve with the 7th Fleet. In addition to special operations, the submarine participated in various fleet and ASW exercises and visited several ports, including Hong Kong, Manila, and Okinawa. Returning to Pearl Harbor June 1962, &quot;Greenfish&quot; engaged in local operations until October, when the Cuban Missile Crisis sent her to Japan to strengthen the 7th Fleet. Upon return to Hawaii December 1962, she underwent a brief overhaul and then resumed her peace time schedule of local and special operations interspersed with training exercises.

Based at Pearl Harbor, she participated in various ASW exercises while maintaining the high tempo of training and readiness for her crew. From 30 March 1964 to 4 September she underwent overhaul; and, after a cruise to the Pacific Coast and back, &quot;Greenfish&quot; departed for the Far East 27 January 1965. She arrived Japan early in February and during the next 4 months operated with the 7th Fleet in waters from Japan to the Philippines. She returned to Pearl Harbor 1 August, continued type training into 1966, and deployed once again to the Western Pacific 1 February 1966. She completed her duty with the 7th Fleet 1 July and returned to Hawaii later that month to resume readiness exercises out of Pearl Harbor. Into 1967 she continued to serve in the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s submarine force. In 1970 she underwent a yard overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, San Francisco, CA. She then underwent weapons alignment in Bangor, WA. Greenfish Transited the Panama Canal and proceeded to Sub base New London. She made a Med cruise and North Atlantic cruise in 1971 and a springboard exercise in 1972.

== Brazilian submarine &quot;Amazonas&quot; (S-16) ==

&quot;Greenfish&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the US Naval Register 29 October 1973, and transferred (sold) under terms of the Security Assistance Program to Brazil, 19 December 1973, where she was renamed &quot;Amazonas&quot; (S-16), the eighth Brazilian Navy ship to be named for the Amazon River. She was struck 15 October 1992, originally to be transformed into a museum ship at the centro Histórico da Marinha in Rio de Janeiro. However, she was ultimately judged to be in too bad condition, and was scrapped in 2001.

<text>Morro de Arica is a steep hill located in the Chilean city of Arica. Its height is 139 metres above sea level. It was the last bulwark of defense for the Peruvian troops who garrisoned the city during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Morro de Arica was assaulted and captured on June 7, 1880, by Chilean troops in the last part of the Tacna and Arica campaign. Morro de Arica rises steeply from the city and the sea, with a more gentle slope towards the east. A giant flag of Chile is flown on its summit. Morro de Arica was declared a national monument on October 6, 1971.

<text>Warren M Anderson (November 29, 1921 – September 29, 2014) was an American businessman who was the chair and CEO of the Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) at the time of the Bhopal disaster in 1984. He was charged with manslaughter by Indian authorities. In 1989 UCC paid $479 million dollars to the Indian government (equivalent to $1.21 billion dollars in 2025) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster.

==Personal life==
Anderson was born in 1921 in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York, to Swedish immigrants. He was named after the American president Warren Harding. He later attended the naval pre-flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He married Lillian Anderson. They lived in Bridgehampton, Long Island, New York, and owned houses in Vero Beach, Florida, and Greenwich, Connecticut. He died at a nursing home in Vero Beach, Florida, on September 29, 2014.

==Bhopal disaster==
The Bhopal disaster took place in a plant belonging to Union Carbide&#x27;s Indian subsidiary, Union Carbide India Limited, in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, on the night of 2–3 December 1984. Thousands of people died and hundreds of thousands more were injured in the disaster. As the UCC CEO, Anderson was charged with manslaughter by Indian authorities. He flew to India and was promptly placed in custody by Indian authorities, but was allowed to return to the United States.

He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gulab Sharma, of Bhopal on February 1, 1992, for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable homicide case. A formal extradition request was issued in 2003. The United States declined to extradite him citing a lack of evidence. The chief judicial magistrate of Bhopal issued an arrest warrant for Anderson on July 31, 2009.

In August 2009, a UCC spokesperson said Union Carbide had no role in operating the plant at the time as the factory was owned, managed and operated by employees of Union Carbide India Limited. Eight former senior employees of the subsidiary were found guilty on June 7, 2010. After these convictions, a UCC spokesperson said, &quot;All the appropriate people from UCIL – officers and those who actually ran the plant on a daily basis – have appeared to face charges.&quot;

<doc id="1169843" wikidata="Q1298973" url="?curid=1169843" title="Small for gestational age">
<text>Small for gestational age (SGA) newborns are those who are smaller in size than normal for the gestational age. SGA is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age. SGA predicts susceptibility to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and polycythemia. By definition, at least 10% of all newborns will be labeled SGA. All SGA babies should be watched for signs of failure to thrive, hypoglycemia and other health conditions.

==Causes==
Being small for gestational age is broadly either:
* Being constitutionally small, or caused by a genetic trait of the baby
* Intrauterine growth restriction, also called pathological SGA

==Diagnosis==
The condition is defined by birth weight and/or length.

Intrauterine growth restriction is generally diagnosed by measuring the mother&#x27;s uterus, with the fundal height being less than it should be for that stage of the pregnancy. If it is suspected, the mother will usually be sent for an ultrasound to confirm.

==Management==
Ninety percent of babies born SGA catch up in growth by the time they reach two years old. For the ten percent of those without catchup growth by two years old, an endocrinologist should be consulted. Some cases warrant growth hormone therapy.

Hypoglycemia is common in asymmetrical SGA babies because their larger brains burn calories at a faster rate than their usually limited fat stores hold. Hypoglycemia is treated by frequent feedings and/or additions of cornstarch-based products (such as Duocal powder) to the feedings.

Some common conditions and disorders found in many that are SGA (and especially those without catchup growth by two years old).
* Gastroenterologist – for gastrointestinal issues such as reflux and/or delayed gastric emptying
* Dietitian – to address caloric deficits. Dietitians are usually brought in for cases that include failure to thrive. According to the theory of thrifty phenotype, causes of growth restriction also trigger epigenetic responses in the fetus that are otherwise activated in times of chronic food shortage, and if the offspring develops in an environment rich in food, it may be more prone to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type II diabetes.
* Speech-language pathologist or occupational therapist – occupational therapists may also treat sensory issues
* Behaviorist – for feeding issues, a behavioral approach may also be used, but usually for older children (over 2)
* Allergist – to diagnose or rule out food allergies (not necessarily more common in those SGA than the normal population)
* Ear, nose and throat doctor – to diagnose enlarged adenoids or tonsils (not necessarily more common in those SGA than the normal population)
For intrauterine growth restriction (during pregnancy), possible treatments include the early induction of labor, though this is only done if the condition has been diagnosed and seen as a risk to the health of the fetus.

==Terminology==
If small for gestational age babies have been the subject of intrauterine growth restriction, formerly known as intrauterine growth retardation, the term &quot;SGA associated with intrauterine growth restriction&quot; is used.
Intrauterine growth restriction refers to a condition in which a fetus is unable to achieve its genetically determined potential size. This functional definition seeks to identify a population of fetuses at risk for modifiable but otherwise poor outcomes. This definition intentionally excludes fetuses that are small for gestational age (SGA) but are not pathologically small. Infants born SGA with severe short stature (or severe SGA) are defined as having a length less than 2.5 standard deviation scores below the mean.

A related term is low birth weight, defined as an infant with a birth weight (that is, mass at the time of birth) of less than , regardless of gestational age at the time of birth.
Other related terms include &quot;very low birth weight&quot;, which is less than ; and &quot;extremely low birth weight&quot;, which is less than . Normal weight at term delivery is .

SGA is not a synonym of low birth weight, very low birth weight, or extremely low birth weight.
For example, with a 35-week gestational age delivery, a weight of is appropriate for gestational age but is still low birth weight. One third of low-birth-weight neonates – infants weighing less than – are small for gestational age.

There is an 8.1% incidence of low birth weight in developed countries, and 6–30% in developing countries. Much of this can be attributed to the health of the mother during pregnancy. One third of babies born with a low birth weight are also small for gestational age. Infants that are born at low birth weights are at risk of developing neonatal infection.

Both low and high maternal serum Vitamin D (25-OH) are associated with higher incidence SGA in white women, although the correlation does not seem to hold for African American women.

<doc id="1169845" wikidata="Q2406791" url="?curid=1169845" title="Upset (competition)">
<text>An upset occurs in a competition, frequently in electoral politics or sports, when the party popularly expected to win (the &quot;favorite&quot;) is defeated by (or, in the case of sports, ties with) an underdog whom the majority expects to lose, defying the conventional wisdom. It is often used in reference to beating the betting odds in sports, or beating the opinion polls in electoral politics.

==Origin==
The meaning of the word &quot;upset&quot; has long included &quot;an overthrowing or overturn of ideas, plans, etc.&quot; (see OED definition 6b), from which the sports definition almost surely derived. &quot;Upset&quot; also once referred to &quot;a curved part of a bridle-bit, fitting over the tongue of the horse&quot;, (now the port of a curb bit), but even though the modern sports meaning of &quot;upset&quot; was first used far more for horse races than for any other competition, there is no evidence of a connection.

In 2002, George Thompson, a lexicographic researcher, used the full-text online search capabilities of &quot;The New York Times&quot; databases to trace the usage of the verb &quot;to upset&quot; and the noun &quot;upset&quot;. The latter was seen in usage as early as 1877.

Thompson&#x27;s research debunked one popular theory of the term&#x27;s origin, namely that it was first used after the surprising defeat of the horse Man o&#x27; War by the racehorse Upset in 1919 (the loss was the only one in Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s career).
The term pre-dates that 1919 Thoroughbred race by at least several decades. In its sports coverage immediately following Upset&#x27;s victory, &quot;the Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;One might make all sorts of puns about it being an upset.&quot;
The name of the horse &quot;Upset&quot; came from the &quot;trouble&quot; or &quot;distress&quot; meaning of the word (as shown by the parallelism of the name of Upset&#x27;s stablemate, Regret).

==Examples of upsets==
=== Sports ===
Below is a selection of major upsets from a variety of popular sports around the world. It is not meant to be comprehensive, merely representative. 

====American football====

*Heading into the 2007 college football season, the Michigan Wolverines were ranked as the pre-season Number 5 team, and among the favorites for that year&#x27;s BCS National Championship. As an early season tune-up game, Michigan had booked the lower division Appalachian State Mountaineers for their first game of the season. The Mountaineers surprised the football world by leading 28–17 at the half. Though Michigan clawed their way back to lead 32–31 late into the fourth quarter, the Mountaineers kicked a field goal with 26 seconds left in the game to take the lead 34–32. Michigan managed to use only 20 seconds of game time to drive the ball down to the App State 27-yard line, and as time was expiring the Mountaineers&#x27; Corey Lynch blocked a Michigan field goal attempt to secure the upset for App State. The game marked only the second time, to that point, that a lower-division school had beaten a top-division AP-ranked team.
*In Super Bowl III, the senior National Football League was playing their third interleague championship game against the upstart American Football League. The NFL had won the prior two matchups without much difficulty, and it looked poised to do so again, as the Baltimore Colts, with a 13–1 record, behind quarterback Earl Morrall, who led the league in touchdown passes that season and was named NFL Most Valuable Player. The team also had several future Hall of Fame players on the roster, including quarterback Johnny Unitas, relegated to a back-up role following an early-season injury, tight end John Mackey, as well as a defense led by perennial all-pro Bubba Smith. The New York Jets were led by Joe Namath at quarterback, who earlier in the week had &quot;guaranteed&quot; victory against the Colts. Namath&#x27;s top target, future Hall of Fame wide receiver Don Maynard, was hobbled by an injury, but Namath led the Jets on a run-focused attack that leaned heavily on fullback Matt Snell, who ran for 121 yards and scored the Jets&#x27; only touchdown. The Jets defense confounded Morrall, who had only six completions on 17 attempts, with three interceptions in the first half, including an interception to the Jets&#x27; Jim Hudson while Colts&#x27; star receiver Jimmy Orr, uncovered in the end zone, waved his hands to no avail. Colts&#x27; head coach Don Shula put the hobbled Unitas in the game in the second half, and despite a late game touchdown, lost the game 16–7.

====Association football====
*Examples of a &quot;giant-killing&quot; non-league team (Levels 5 to 10) beating a Level 1 opponent in the English FA Cup are National League side Lincoln City&#x27;s away victory over Premier League side Burnley in the 2016–17 FA Cup and Conference Premier side Luton Town&#x27;s away victory over the Premier League&#x27;s Norwich City in the 2012–13 fourth round proper. This was the first defeat of a top flight team by non-league opposition since 1989, when Sutton United claimed a 2–1 victory at home over Coventry City, who had won the FA Cup two seasons earlier and finished that season seventh in the First Division.
* Leicester City F.C., an English football club, were crowned champions of the 2015–16 Premier League. The club had narrowly avoided the relegation the previous season by finishing 14th and being in the bottom of the table the most part of the season. At the beginning of the season, bookmakers had given Leicester City odds of 5000/1 against them winning the league. It was the first English title in their history.
*A major upset in Spanish football was the Alcorconazo, when in the first leg of a 2009–10 Copa del Rey AD Alcorcón won over Real Madrid 4–0. Real Madrid is one of the largest clubs in Spanish football and the world while Alcorcón team played in the third-tier Segunda División B. Because Real Madrid won the second leg only 1–0, Alcorcón advanced victorious to the next round. The half-time substitution of Guti when the score was 3–0 and when he was booked before was another topic in the Spanish press because of words exchanged between the player and his coach, Manuel Pellegrini.

====Baseball====
*The 1906 World Series looked to be one of the most lopsided matchups in World Series history, as the National League powerhouse Chicago Cubs, with a record of 116–36 represented the best winning percentage in modern Major League Baseball history. They faced off against their cross-town rivals, the Chicago White Sox, who finished with the American League pennant having a record of 93–58. The White Sox were dubbed the &quot;hitless wonders&quot; as their .230 team batting average was not only the worst batting average by a team to win their league pennant, it was the worst overall batting average in all of Major League Baseball that season. Buoyed by a pitching staff that held the Cubs to a below .200 batting average for the series, the White Sox showed an uncharacteristic surge of batting prowess in games 5 and 6 with 16 runs on 26 hits over the two games to claim the World Series crown four games to two in what has been called the biggest upset in MLB history.

====Basketball====
*In the 1985 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the Georgetown Hoyas had won the previous national championship, and looked poised to win their second straight, as they entered the 1985 national championship as the defending national champion with the Number 1 overall seed, as well as the Number 1 seed in the East Region, posting a record of 35–2, including a Big East tournament title. Their opponent and Big East rival, the Number 8 seed Villanova Wildcats, entered the national championship with a 24–10 record. Villanova defeated Georgetown, 66–64, in what has been considered one of the biggest upsets in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament history. As of 2022, this is the only time an 8th-seeded team has won the NCAA tournament and the 1984–85 Villanova team remains the lowest-seeded team to win the NCAA tournament.
*The Stanford Cardinal entered the 1998 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament with the Number 1 seed in the West Region, posting a record of 21–5, including a Pac-10 regular season title. Their opponent, the Number 16 seed Harvard Crimson, entered the tournament with a 22–4 record and an Ivy League regular season title. Before this match, no Number 1 seed had ever fallen to a Number 16 seed since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1994. Harvard defeated Stanford, 71–67, in what has been considered the biggest upset in NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament history. 20 years later, a Number 16 seed had beaten a Number 1 seed in men&#x27;s tournament (see below).
*The Virginia Cavaliers entered the 2018 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament with the Number 1 overall seed, as well as the Number 1 seed in the South Region, posting a record of 31–2, including both an ACC regular season title and ACC tournament title. Their opponent, Number 16 seed UMBC, entered the tournament with a 24–10 record and an America East tournament title. Before this match, no Number 1 seed had ever fallen to a Number 16 seed since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. UMBC defeated Virginia, 74–54, in what has been considered the biggest upset in NCAA Tournament history.
*The Purdue Boilermakers entered the 2023 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament with the Number 1 seed in the East Region, posting a record of 29–5, including both a Big Ten regular season and tournament title. Their opponent, Number 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, entered the tournament with a 20–15 record after an 84–61 win over Texas Southern in the First Four. Despite a 67–66 loss in the Northeast Conference tournament championship game to the NEC regular season champion Merrimack Warriors, Fairleigh Dickinson received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the NEC tournament runners-up, while the NEC tournament champion Merrimack was ineligible for the NCAA tournament due to a 4-year transition from Division II. Closed as 23.5-point underdogs, Fairleigh Dickinson shocked Purdue 63–58 to become the second Number 16 seed to beat a Number 1 seed in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament history.
*Entering the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, the Dallas Mavericks had the best record in all of NBA at 67–15, six games up on second place, while their first round opponent, the Golden State Warriors, had a 42–40 record and had only qualified for the tournament on the last day of the regular season, having needed to win all of their last five games just to qualify. Dallas was captained by power forward Dirk Nowitzki, who was in the midst of a Hall-of-Fame career that would feature 14 all star appearances, and supported by other star players such as Jason Terry, Jerry Stackhouse, Devin Harris, and Josh Howard. Golden State had completely revamped their team mid-season, including two starters (Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington), who arrived in January in a blockbuster 8-player deal with the Indiana Pacers. Baron Davis was the unquestioned star of the playoff run, as he dominated the Mavericks, averaging 25.3 points, 6.5 assists, and 2.9 steals per game, as the Warriors would knock off the Mavericks four games to two.
*Entering the second round of the 2020 NBA Playoffs, The Los Angeles Clippers, under the guidance by championship head coach Doc Rivers, were widely regarded as frontrunners for the championship. Armed with star talents like Kawhi Leonard, who came off a championship win with the Toronto Raptors, and Paul George, a previous MVP candidate and first-team All-Defensive player, and defensive guard Patrick Beverley, the Clippers had high expectations. Their deep bench, featuring Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams, added to their championship aspirations, while their strong defensive prowess further solidified their position. However, the Denver Nuggets, guided by the dynamic duo of Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokić, emerged as formidable challengers. Murray&#x27;s explosive scoring prowess, highlighted by a remarkable 40-point performance in Game 7, combined with Jokić&#x27;s extraordinary playmaking and versatility as a center, were instrumental in fueling the Nuggets&#x27; remarkable comeback. This unforeseen development showcased the Nuggets&#x27; remarkable resilience and their strategic acumen in exploiting the Clippers&#x27; defensive weaknesses. In contrast, the Clippers&#x27; star players faltered significantly in the crucial Game 7, with Leonard managing only 14 points and a 6-of-22 shooting performance, and George contributing a mere 10 points at a shooting efficiency of 25%, including a notable miss that hit the side of the backboard during a 3-point attempt. Notably, both stars were unable to score in the 4th quarter. This series of events culminated in a stunning reversal, as the Clippers lost their dominant 3–1 series lead, becoming the 12th team in NBA history to do so. The Nuggets, driven by the exceptional performances of Murray and Jokić, clinched a victory in what became one of the most unexpected and memorable upsets in recent NBA playoff history.
*Entering the first round of the 2023 NBA playoffs, the Milwaukee Bucks earned the inaugural Maurice Podoloff Trophy as the NBA&#x27;s best regular season team with a 58–24 record, while their first round opponent, the Miami Heat, had a 44–38 record, had won their second straight Southeast Division, had qualified for the playoffs for the fourth straight year, and earned the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference. Despite losing to the Atlanta Hawks 116–105 in the first play-in tournament game, Miami bounced back and defeated the Chicago Bulls 102–91 in the final play-in tournament game. Milwaukee was coached by Mike Budenholzer, who is a two-time NBA Coach of the Year and won the NBA championship in 2021. The Miami Heat knocked off the Milwaukee Bucks in five games, in what has been considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA playoffs history. This made the Heat the first number 8 seed to win a playoff series after qualifying for the play-in tournament. This also made the Bucks the sixth number 1 seed to lose a playoff series in the opening round (the others being the 1994 SuperSonics, 1999 Heat, 2007 Mavericks, 2011 Spurs, and 2012 Bulls).

====Cricket====

*In the 1983 Cricket World Cup, the third edition of the tournament, the West Indies cricket team had won both of the previous two World Cups and looked poised to win their third. Their opponent in the finals, India, had never made it out of the group stage before 1983. India went to bat first, and managed 183 before being dismissed with five overs left. West Indies star batsman, Viv Richards, hit a hook towards the leg-side boundary, where Indian captain Kapil Dev made a running catch to get out the West Indies best batsman. Among the remaining batsman, only Jeff Dujon managed more than 20 runs, and West Indies were bowled out at 140, giving India their first World Cup.

====Ice hockey====
*Entering the medal round of the 1980 Winter Olympics, the Soviet Union had won four consecutive gold medals of the previous four Winter Olympics and were heavily favored to win another gold medal. Their opponent, the United States, consisted entirely of collegiate and amateur players and under head coach Herb Brooks, had finished second in Blue Division behind Sweden (based on goal difference) and qualified for the medal round. The U.S. pulled off a 4–3 upset over the Soviets, in what has since become known as the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;. After that loss, the Soviets pummeled Sweden to settle for silver, while the U.S. went on to win gold after defeating Finland.
*Entering the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Tampa Bay Lightning earned the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best regular season team with a 62–16–4 record (128 points), while their first round opponent, the Columbus Blue Jackets, had a 47–31–4 record (98 points), had qualified for the playoffs for the third straight year and earned the second wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. The Blue Jackets swept the Lightning in four games and won the playoff series for the first time in franchise history, in what has been considered the biggest upset in Stanley Cup playoffs history. This marks the first time in Stanley Cup playoffs history that the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners were swept in the opening round.
*Entering the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Boston Bruins had set new NHL records for single-season wins and points, finishing with a 65–12–5 record (135 points), and earning the President&#x27;s Trophy. By contrast, their first round opponent, the Florida Panthers, had narrowly qualified for the playoffs, finishing with a 42–32–8 record (92 points), and clinching an Eastern Conference wild card berth one day after their penultimate regular-season game. The Panthers defeated the Bruins in seven games, rallying from a 3–1 series deficit and winning three straight games to eliminate Boston; additionally, the team advanced to the second round of the playoffs for just the third time in franchise history. The 43-point difference between the two teams represented the largest upset by standings position of any best-of-seven playoff series in NHL history.

====Skiing====
*Ester Ledecká won the gold medal in super-G alpine skiing at the 2018 Winter Olympics, after finishing 0.01 seconds ahead of the 2014 Olympics defending gold medalist Anna Veith, who had already been proclaimed the winner by many media outlets. Ledecká was ranked 49th in the event before the Olympics and had never medalled in any World Cup level international skiing event.

====Quizzing====
*At the 4th edition of the Mirko Miočić Memorial in 2020, an unexpected shift occurred in the pairs event of the quizzing world. After years of dominance by Dean Kotiga and Perica Živanović, who had long been the gold standard in competitive quizzing duos, the duo of Mladen Vukorepa and Karlo Plazina stunned everyone with a remarkable upset victory. The event, named in honor of Croatian quiz legend Mirko Miočić, has always been a significant fixture on the quizzing calendar, attracting some of the top quizzing talent in the region. For years, Kotiga and Živanović had made the pairs event their own, consistently emerging victorious and seemingly unbeatable due to their incredible breadth of knowledge and synergy as a team. However, 2020 saw Vukorepa and Plazina rise to the occasion. They capitalized on their own deep knowledge base and effective teamwork, proving that even the strongest champions can be challenged. Their victory not only broke the long-standing dominance of Kotiga and Živanović but also signaled a new era in Croatian and regional quizzing. The duo’s win at the Mirko Miočić Memorial was a testament to their preparation and resilience, cementing their place among the top quizzing pairs. The win was significant not just because of the upset, but because it occurred at such a prestigious event, where the competition is fierce and the pressure high. Vukorepa and Plazina’s triumph will long be remembered as a key moment in the tournament&#x27;s history and in the wider quizzing community.

====Boxing====
*Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas Undisputed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson Lost his belt to Buster Douglas Despite being the 42 to 1 favorite It was the first loss of Tyson&#x27;s career 

=== Politics ===
Below is a list of elections which have extensively been described as upsets by a number of major media sources. It is not meant to be comprehensive, merely representative.

==== Argentina ====
* 2023 Argentine primary elections: presidential candidate Javier Milei of La Libertad Avanza (LLA) finished as the most voted candidate in the election. Opinion polling for the 2023 Argentine general election had predicted that Sergio Massa of the Union for the Homeland (UP) led by the Justicialist Party (PJ) would be the most voted candidate and Juntos por el Cambio (JxC) the most voted coalition overall. It was the first time that a right wing candidate won the primary elections since the 1916 Argentine general election; since then, all presidents of Argentina were either from the Radical Civic Union (UCR) or derivates, the Justicialists, or JxC.

==== Australia ====
*1993 federal election: the ruling 10-year old Labor Party government won a fifth consecutive term in office, despite trailing the opposition Liberal-National Coalition during the election campaign.
*2015 Queensland state election: Three years after the Queensland Labor Party was turfed out of state government by the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) in a massive landslide and reduced to 7 seats in the 89 seat state parliament, Labor overturned the LNP&#x27;s massive majority and returned to power on a massive swing, forming a minority government. The LNP lead in the opinion polls and the scale of the LNP victory in the previous election made it appear that its defeat was unlikely.
*2019 federal election: the ruling Liberal-National Coalition won an absolute majority of 77 out of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, despite trailing the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls for almost three years.

==== Croatia ====

*2016 parliamentary election: The election yielded a surprise victory for the Croatian Democratic Union, though most opinion polls had predicted the People&#x27;s coalition would have the largest share of seats in Parliament.
*2020 parliamentary election: The ruling Croatian Democratic Union obtained an upset victory over the Restart Coalition, who had previously been leading in opinion polls for several weeks prior to the election.

==== Czech Republic ====
*2013 presidential election: Karel Schwarzenberg finished as the runner-up over former prime Minister Jan Fischer who was previously leading polls. He was ultimately defeated by Miloš Zeman.
*2021 parliamentary election: Opinion polls had shown ANO 2011 as the clear front-runner while Spolu was polling second. No opinion poll placed SPOLU in the first place and it was widely believed that ANO 2011 would win the election. Eventually Spolu received the higher number of votes and its leader Petr Fiala became the new Prime Minister.

==== Ecuador ====
*2023 general election: presidential candidate Daniel Noboa of the National Democratic Action unexpectedly came in second place, advancing to a runoff election against Luisa González of the Citizen Revolution Movement, despite Noboa&#x27;s poor performance in general polls leading up to the election. Noboa ended up defeating González in the runoff election.

==== France ====
*2002 presidential election: far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the National Front, finished as the runner-up over prime minister Lionel Jospin and thus progressed to a run-off against incumbent president Jacques Chirac. Chirac would ultimately defeat Le Pen in a historic landslide.
*2024 French legislative election: When polls indicated that the National Rally, under Marine Le Pen, would win an outright majority after winning the first round of the election, they were unexpectedly beaten by the New Popular Front, a four-party left-wing alliance.

==== The Gambia ====

*2016 presidential election: dictatorial president Yahya Jammeh, in power since 1994, unexpectedly lost the election to opposition candidate Adama Barrow.

==== India ====

* 2024 Indian general election: The governing Bharatiya Janata Party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi (in power since 2014) unexpectedly lost its majority in the Lok Sabha, despite opinion polls predicting them expanding their majority. Its alliance, the NDA, did win a majority of seats, requiring a coalition government.

==== Israel ====

*1996 Prime ministerial election: Although Shimon Peres was leading opinion polls and was projected to win the election by exit polls, Benjamin Netanyahu won by a margin of 29,457 votes, less than 1% of the total number of votes cast.

==== Malaysia ====

*2018 House of Representatives election: the opposition Pakatan Harapan coalition won an absolute majority of 113 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (lower house of parliament), thus ending the 61-year rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition and bringing about the first change of a ruling party in the country&#x27;s history.

==== Netherlands ====

*2023 general election: The results of the election were described as &quot;one of the biggest political upsets in Dutch politics since World War II&quot;, with the right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives.

==== Pakistan ====

*2024 general election: The PML-N party led by three-time former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was viewed as the favourite to win, with Sharif expected to easily become Prime Minister for a fourth time. Sharif was perceived as the favourite of the powerful military establishment, likely to counter their common adversary, jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Despite this, candidates affiliated with Khan’s PTI party emerged as the largest group on election night. This was seen as an exceptionally unlikely outcome, since the party was forced to field their candidates as independents after an unfavourable ruling in the Supreme Court, which severely limited their campaigning operations.

==== Poland ====

*2015 presidential election: The incumbent Bronisław Komorowski was leading nearly all opinion polls taken before the first round of the election, with some polls taken in late 2014 and early 2015 suggesting he was on track for an outright win that would avoid a runoff election. Andrzej Duda eventually took a narrow first-place finish over Komorowski and went on to win the election in the runoff.

==== Romania ====
* 2024 Romanian presidential election (first round, later annulled due to intelligence reports of Russian interference): Călin Georgescu, a pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and far-right independent candidate, achieved a relative majority of votes, while Elena Lasconi of the centre-right Save Romania Union finished second and also advanced to the runoff vote. Initially viewed as a minor candidate with little chance of victory due to his far-right views, Georgescu quickly gained significant support through campaigning on non-traditional media outlets such as TikTok, receiving particular popularity among those disaffected with current Romanian politics, including youth, farmers, rural voters, and members of the working class. He was then considered the front-runner in the race, and polling conducted after the first round of voting found him to be the most popular figure in the country&#x27;s politics. The aftermath of the first round was controversial and led Romania to the brink of a political crisis. Incumbent president Klaus Iohannis and chair of the Supreme Council of National Defence accused Georgescu&#x27;s campaign of being supported by Russia. Following vote rigging allegations made by a minor candidate, the Constitutional Court of Romania ordered a recount; it ultimately decided to confirm the results of the first round on 2 December. On 6 December, the Constitutional Court reversed their decision and annulled the first round of the election after intelligence documents were declassified stating that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote Georgescu.

==== Serbia ====

*2012 presidential election: Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party defeated Boris Tadić of the Democratic Party, who had recently resigned as the president of Serbia in order to trigger an early election. Nikolić had previously lost to Tadić in two elections.

====Slovakia====

*2004 presidential election: Ivan Gašparovič finished as the runner-up over front-runner Eduard Kukan and advanced to run-off against Vladimír Mečiar whom he eventually defeated. Reportedly, Gasparovič himself did not expect to be a runner-up as he went home to sleep after he cast his vote.

====Slovenia====

*2012 presidential election: Borut Pahor received the highest number of votes in the first round despite the incumbent president Danilo Türk leading opinion polls. Pahor then defeated Türk in the runoff.

==== Sri Lanka ====

*2015 presidential election: Two-term strongman president Mahinda Rajapaksa of the ruling United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance lost his bid for a third term to opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena.

==== Turkey ====

* 2023 general election: Opinion polls and media outlets implied incumbent AKP president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was likely to lose to Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the CHP opposition candidate fielded by the Nation Alliance, amid fallout from the ongoing economic crisis and the February 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes. Erdoğan ultimately secured 49.5% of the vote against Kılıçdaroğlu&#x27;s 44.9% in the first round of the presidential election, and won the runoff by a margin of 4.36%.

==== United Kingdom ====

*1945 general election: The universal expectation that successful wartime leader Winston Churchill would win the first poll following the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War was shattered by the overwhelming landslide victory of the Labour Party, raising Clement Attlee to the post of Prime Minister.
*1970 general election: Most opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable victory for the incumbent Labour government. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government.
*1992 general election: the ruling Conservative Party won a fourth consecutive absolute majority in the House of Commons, despite opinion polls having predicted a hung parliament or a narrow absolute majority for the opposition Labour Party.

Jeffrey was elected as a city councillor for Brampton&#x27;s Ward 2 in 1991, and helped to negotiate the sale of Brampton Hydro toward the end of the decade (in addition to representing Brampton on the provincial Hydro One Board of Directors). Jeffrey also chaired the city&#x27;s Budget Committee, and increased public access to the city&#x27;s budget review process during her time as a councillor. She served as Acting Mayor of Brampton in May 2001, making at least one official appearance with the title.

===Provincial politics===
During the Progressive Conservatives Party of Ontario 2002 leadership contest, Jeffrey was approached to be the returning officer in Brampton as the party wanted someone who would be independent. In order to be a returning officer, she had to be a member of the party so she joined the PC party in 2002.

Jeffrey joined the Ontario Liberal Party in 2003 after being recruited by Greg Sorbara to run in the provincial election of 2003. She defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Joe Spina by 1,005 votes in Brampton Centre. The Liberals won the election and she initially served as a backbench supporter of Premier Dalton McGuinty. She was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Brampton-Springdale in 2007 and 2011.

Between 2005 and 2010 she served in a variety of positions including Parliamentary Assistant to the Ministers of Children and Youth Services, Democratic Renewal, Intergovernmental Affairs, Citizenship and Immigration and Transportation.

On January 18, 2010, Premier Dalton McGuinty appointed her to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources. On October 10, 2011, she was appointed Minister of Labour and Minister Responsible for Seniors.

During the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership contest, Jeffrey was the first cabinet minister and one of four sitting MPPs (along with Reza Moridi, Mario Sergio, and David Zimmer) that endorsed Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s candidacy at Wynne&#x27;s campaign launch. On February 11, 2013, Wynne appointed her Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Chair of Cabinet.

===Cabinet positions===



===Mayor of Brampton===
After incumbent Brampton mayor Susan Fennell was embroiled in numerous scandals over expenses and financial record-keeping, former Ontario Premier Bill Davis reportedly convinced Jeffrey to resign from provincial cabinet to challenge Fennell.

On March 25, 2014, Jeffrey resigned from the legislature to run for Mayor of Brampton in the 2014 municipal election. As of September 30, 2014 she was polling well ahead of the incumbent Susan Fennell. She won the mayoral election defeating Susan Fennell with 49.33% of the vote.

After taking office as mayor, Jeffrey appointed former Premier Davis to a panel tasked with bringing a university to Brampton. However, Davis and Jeffrey had a falling out over Peel Region&#x27;s proposed Light Rail Transit line, as Jeffrey supported its extension from Hurontario Street in Mississauga further north along Main Street in Brampton (where it would run by Davis&#x27; house), while Davis preferred an alternative alignment along Queen Street.

Jeffrey&#x27;s 2018 re-election campaign saw Jeffrey run against former Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leader Patrick Brown and former Conservative federal minister Bal Gosal, among others. Former Premier Davis had switched his support to Brown over the Light Rail Transit issue. Despite that, and her background as a Liberal, Jeffrey held a fundraiser at the Conservative Party-associated venue the Albany Club of Toronto, accepting endorsements from former Ontario Progressive Conservative Party presidents Richard Ciano and Ken Zeise, as well as Michael Diamond, Premier Doug Ford&#x27;s leadership campaign manager. According to the Toronto Star, Jeffrey had the backing of &quot;PC party operatives — Doug Ford’s campaign manager organized a fundraiser for her&quot;.

Jeffery lost her re-election bid to Patrick Brown by a narrow margin in the 2018 Peel Region municipal elections. In a speech to supporters, Jeffrey said that during her tenure as mayor, &quot;we brought in accountability, openness and transparency to city hall. I can confidently say our city is in better shape than what I found it”.

<doc id="1169867" wikidata="Q2526204" url="?curid=1169867" title="Cambridge City F.C.">
<text>Cambridge City Football Club is a football club based in Cambridgeshire, England, who currently play in the . Formed in 1908 as Cambridge Town F.C. in Cambridge, they played their home games at the City Ground, Cambridge, between 1922 and 2013, and changed their name in 1951 when Cambridge was granted city status. Since 2013 they have been without a permanent home ground, groundsharing at Histon&#x27;s Bridge Road (2013–15, 2018–2023), and St Ives Town&#x27;s Westwood Road (2015-18, 2023-2024). Cambridge City’s new ground at Sawston opened on 30th of November, 2024, with a crowd of 1,459 watching City lose 2-1 to Tilbury.

Their home colours are white and black, and their nickname is &quot;‘The Lilywhites’&quot;. Club honours include the Challenge International du Nord in 1912, and Southern League champions 1962–63.

==History==
The club was founded in 1908 as Cambridge Town F.C. (Cambridge had not been granted city status at that point) by the committee of the Cambridge St. Mary&#x27;s club, and were committed to amateur sport. The club competed in the Southern Amateur League, developing a fierce rivalry with Ipswich Town that was evident both on and off the pitch.
In 1912 they won the Challenge International du Nord in 1912, beating US Tourquennoise 4–1. The club were invited to join the newly formed Eastern Counties League in 1935, but declined the invitation and switched instead to the Spartan League.

The resumption of football after the Second World War saw Cambridge Town continuing in the Spartan League, winning the competition 3 times between 1945 and 1950, before joining the Athenian League for the 1950–51 season. Cambridge was formally granted city status in 1951. Both Cambridge Town and their neighbours Abbey United applied to change their name to Cambridge City. Cambridge Town&#x27;s application was approved because it arrived first and therefore Abbey United changed their name to Cambridge United. In 1958, 22 years after turning down the chance to apply to the Football League, Cambridge City joined the Southern League South Eastern zone as a professional club. The club went on to make five applications to join the Football League between 1959 and 1974, all of which were unsuccessful.

In the late 1950s and 1960s Cambridge City commanded the highest attendances in non-league football, regularly attracting average gates in excess of 3,500 (higher than rivals United during that period) and occasionally attracting gates over 10,000. They were Southern League Champions in 1962–63 and stayed in the League&#x27;s top division until 1968, when they were relegated and turned semi-professional. They were promoted back to the Premier Division after finishing in the Division One runners-up spot in 1969–70, and finished second in their first season back in the Premier Division.

Cambridge United were elected into the Football League in 1970, and from that point City struggled to attract as many supporters to their games as their cross-city rivals – by the early 1980s, when United were enjoying a prolonged spell in the 2nd Division, City were attracting fewer than 200 supporters to each game. 1975–76 saw the second relegation in the club&#x27;s history, into the Southern League&#x27;s Division One North. They remained there until 1979–80, when a re-organisation of the league&#x27;s structure, in order to become a feeder to the newly formed Football Conference, placed City in the Midland Division. A switch was made to the Southern Division in the 1982–83 season and this seemed to coincide with a turn around in City&#x27;s fortunes, and 1985–86 saw City win the division on goal difference and gain promotion back to the Premier Division. The late 1980s through to the early 90&#x27;s saw City competing at the top of the Premier Division.

City suffered a last day relegation at Atherstone United in May 1996, only to be reprieved. After a few seasons struggling at the wrong end of the table, including another reprieve from relegation in 1999, City&#x27;s league form improved at just the right time and the club joined the Football Conference&#x27;s newly formed South Division in 2004–05, embarking on a successful FA Cup run in the same season – following United&#x27;s relegation from the League in 2005, the two Cambridge clubs were only one division apart. However, the club was encountering financial difficulties and the club&#x27;s City Ground was sold to an Isle of Man company called Ross River, which was linked to Brian York, a man who had briefly been a director of the club. The then board announced that it was to scrap the first team and make the reserve team into a feeder for Cambridge United. This prompted the formation of a supporters&#x27; trust, who within weeks had taken over the running of the club. The club took Ross River to court, where it was ruled that the club were victims of fraudulent misrepresentation and bribery – the former chief executive Arthur Eastham having taken a £10,000 payment from Brian York. though the original deal was not overturned.

In May 2008 City were demoted from the Conference South, after their ground failed an FA inspection, to the Southern League Premier Division for the 2008–09 season. They were moved into the Isthmian League Division One North for 2019–20, before switching to the Northern Premier League Midlands Division for the start of the 2021/22 season, where they continue to be members.

==Colours and badge==
Cambridge City have traditionally played in white shirts, leading to the club being nicknamed &quot;The Lilywhites&quot;, they currently play in white shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their current away strip is sky blue shirts, sky blue shorts and sky blue socks.

The club uses the City of Cambridge&#x27;s coat of arms as a badge. It features a fortified bridge over a river.

==Stadium==

The City Ground (also known as &quot;Milton Road&quot;), was Cambridge City&#x27;s home ground from 29 April 1922 until 27 April 2013, located in the Chesterton area of the city, approximately 0.62 miles (1 km) north of the city centre. The original ground was one of the largest outside the football league and was estimated to have a capacity in excess of 16,000 although the highest recorded attendance was 12,058 against Leytonstone on 11 February 1950. In the mid-1980s, part of the land the original ground stood on was sold for redevelopment, with a new ground built on the remaining land. The capacity of the second ground was approximately 3,000 with 700 seats.

The club was in a legal dispute with their landlords over the ground, which was sold by a previous board of directors for less than its market value. The High Court ruled that the club had been fraudulently misrepresented, and the club will receive 50% of the development profits on the site.

In February 2010, Cambridge City announced a three-year ground-share with Newmarket Town at their Cricket Field Road ground in Newmarket, approximately 13 miles away, for the 2010–2011 season. The ground was deemed to need work to bring it up to the required standard, and Cambridge City were to use this time to seek a permanent home closer to Cambridge. The groundshare was later deferred several times, and in April 2013, it was announced that the club had agreed a 2-year groundshare with neighbours Histon, with City sharing Bridge Road from the beginning of the 2013–14 season. From 2015 to 2018 they groundshared with St Ives Town, at their Westwood Road stadium. The Lilywhites revived their share with Histon at the start of the 2018–19 season till 2022–23 before returning to Westwood Road again for a temporary short-term arrangement.

===New Stadium===
In 2012, it was announced that the club&#x27;s president, Len Satchell, had bought 35 acres of land in Sawston, a village 9 kilometres/ 6 miles south of Cambridge, with a view to building the club a new 3,000-seat stadium, alongside community facilities for the surrounding area. Following public consultation and an appeal over the decision to grant planning permission, the new stadium plan was approved by the council in 2019. Construction began in January 2021 and the stadium opened in 2024.

<text>Funeral are a Norwegian funeral doom band formed in 1991 by Thomas Angell and Anders Eek; soon afterward, Einar Frederiksen joined as bassist and songwriter and Christian Loos joined as guitarist. They are known as one of the pioneers of the funeral doom genre.

==History==
In 1993, the band recorded their first demo, entitled &quot;Tristesse&quot;, released the following year as a mini CD by an American record label. According to the official Funeral website this demo won them the title of &quot;the most depressing band in the world&quot;. Funeral then made a decision to turn more symphonic and the result was shown on their demo &quot;Beyond All Sunsets&quot;. In 1994 the band became one of the first doom metal bands to recruit a female vocalist, Toril Snyen. In 1995 they released the album &quot;Tragedies&quot;. In the same year, they parted with Toril Snyen.

The following year they went to England and recorded ten tracks at Academy Studios without vocals (because of lack of a vocalist) and worked with such bands as My Dying Bride, Anathema and Cradle of Filth. Later the band recruited Sarah Eick as their female vocalist and finished five of the ten tracks, resulting in &quot;To Mourn Is a Virtue&quot;, also known as &quot;Demo &#x27;97&quot; in 1997. The 5 track demo CD is very rare as there were only a few copies distributed to record companies, radio stations and serious fanzines worldwide.

Again the band had to part with their vocalist. However, they quickly found a replacement and Hanne Hukkelberg was placed on the line-up as she had a good knowledge of music and was suitable for the band. Funeral produced another demo in 1999 entitled &quot;The Passion Play&quot;, also known as &quot;Demo &#x27;99&quot;, and it is once again rare as it was only distributed to record labels, radio stations and fanzines. In 2002, they released their album &quot;In Fields of Pestilent Grief&quot; through the Italian label Nocturnal Music.

In January 2003, bassist/songwriter Einar Frederiksen committed suicide on January 10 and the band was on hiatus for the rest of the year.

In 2004, four of the ten Academy-tracks (originally recorded in 1997) were partly re-written, and was Frode Forsmo&#x27;s first work as Funeral singer. This was intended as a new demo, but ended up not being released, as totally new material was written.

2005 saw the band recording a new nine-track album.

In April 2006, the Finnish label Firedoom Records released the remastered and re-released version of &quot;Tragedies&quot; and &quot;Tristesse&quot; as a double album, with unreleased bonus-tracks taken from the Beyond All Sunsets Sessions and the Tragedies Sessions from 1994 and 1995. Included on the re-release there are unpublished pictures and poems, as well as new cover art.

Autumn 2006 saw Funeral sign with the Norwegian label Tabu Recordings.

On October 28, 2006, tragedy again struck, as guitarist Christian Loos died. To yet again fulfill the line-up, Mats Lerberg was recruited as guitarist.

The album &quot;From These Wounds&quot; was released on Candlelight Records on December 4, 2006.

2007 saw Kjetil Ottersen depart, later being replaced by Erlend Nybø.

On September 22, 2008, Funeral released another album, titled &quot;As the Light Does the Shadow&quot;.

On March 13, 2009, the band posted on Myspace that they had fourteen new songs with a total time of over 100 minutes in pre-production. On July 28, 2009, the band also posted on Myspace that there was a medley of songs from the upcoming album. Considering that there are 17 songs in the making, the band went on to state that a double album is possible. Roger Bjørge will be helping out with orchestration.

On April 26, 2010, it was announced on the Funeral website that they had parted ways with vocalist/bassist Frode Forsmo.

The album &quot;To Mourn is a Virtue&quot; was released on May 24, 2011, the first four tracks feature Frode Forsmo on vocals, the next four feature Oysten Rustad and the final track is a remastering of a song recorded at Academy studio in England for the 1997 demo with Sarah Eick.

<doc id="1169880" wikidata="Q1391862" url="?curid=1169880" title="Missouri wine">
<text>Missouri wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in Missouri. German immigrants in the early-to-mid-19th century founded the wine industry in Missouri, resulting in its wine corridor being called the Missouri &quot;Rhineland&quot;. Later Italian immigrants also entered wine production. In the mid-1880s, more wine was produced by volume in Missouri than in any other state. Before prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the nation. Missouri had the first area recognized as a federally designated American Viticultural Area with the Augusta AVA acknowledged on June 20, 1980. There are now four AVAs in Missouri. In 2017 there were 125 wineries operating in the state of Missouri, up from 92 in 2009.

==History==
German immigrants to the Missouri River valley established vineyards and wineries on both sides of the river. Hermann, Missouri, settled by Germans in 1837, had ideal conditions to grow grapes for wine. By 1848 winemakers there produced per year, expanding to per year by 1856. Overall, the state produced per year by the 1880s, the most of any state in the nation. Stone Hill Winery in Hermann became the second largest in the nation (and the third-largest in the world), shipping a million barrels of wine by the turn of the 20th century. Its wines won awards at world fairs in Vienna in 1873 and Philadelphia in 1876.

In the mid-19th century, the phylloxera louse destroyed much of the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grape crop in Europe, especially France, after a Frenchman transferred American wine grapes carrying phylloxera to France. Missouri&#x27;s state entomologist, Charles Riley, found that American rootstocks were resistant to the pest. He directed selling millions of rootstocks to vineyards around the world, to which their grape varieties could be grafted. This saved the French wine industry as well as others. The city of Montpellier erected statues honoring these events, as well as Riley&#x27;s scientific colleague J.É. Planchon.

Before Prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the nation. The new amendment forced the shutdown or abandonment of all wineries except that at St. Stanislaus Seminary, in Florissant, which was permitted to make sacramental wines. The wine industry was destroyed for decades.

Revival of the state&#x27;s wine industry started in 1965 with the reopening of Stone Hill Winery (originally established in 1847) in Hermann by Jim and Betty Held, followed soon by the opening of Mount Pleasant Winery in Augusta on the north side of the river. By 1974, Jim Dierberg was restoring the Hermannhof Winery, which had originally been opened in 1855.

The federal government has recognized the importance of winemaking to regional and national economies. The region received the first certification issued by the U.S. government as a distinct American Viticultural Area (AVA) in 1972. This certification recognizes their qualities of soil, climate and other unique characteristics that help create identifiable wines. One distinct area was developed on the north side of the Missouri River in southwestern St. Charles County. The Augusta AVA was recognized in 1980. The Hermann AVA, on the south side of the river chiefly in Gasconade County, was designated by the federal government in 1983.

Italian as well as German immigrants introduced wine production in the Rolla, Missouri area. This is now within the Ozark Highlands AVA, designated in 1987 and including parts of several counties, from southern Gasconade County to Texas and Dent counties further south.

All three smaller AVAs are within the Ozark Mountain AVA, a designation covering southern Missouri below the Missouri River, northwestern Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma.

==Grapes varieties==

Missouri&#x27;s climate, with its long, hot summers, good sun exposure, and thin rocky Ozarks soil, is excellent for growing grapes. The moderate average temperature allows natural cellaring of wine.

The most prominent Missouri-grown variety is Cynthiana/Norton, believed to be a variety of &quot;Vitis aestivalis&quot;. Other varieties grown include native American grapes, Concord and Catawba, as well as French-American hybrids such as Vignoles, Seyval, and Chambourcin. Recently, there has been more interest in planting &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grapes varieties, especially the fine European grapes: Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Petit Verdot and Mourvedre.

==Industry==

The wine industry in Missouri is growing rapidly. Missouri has more than planted in grapes. In 2008 over 888,000 gallons of Missouri wine was sold. The market share of Missouri wine within the state was 7.95% in 2008. The wine industry in Missouri has consistently grown for over a decade, in 2009 97 wineries were producing select Missouri wines. These were supported by over 400 local vineyards. Missouri&#x27;s winery count was over 126 by 2016. Many of these are small &quot;mom and pop&quot; wineries that have become favorite day-trip sites for many. The four largest wineries in Missouri are (in order): St. James Winery, Stone Hill Winery, Les Bourgeois Winery, and Meramec Vineyards Winery. Missouri is home to five wine trails which host wine events and festivals year round and encourage weekend getaways to some of the established wine regions in the state.

A state tax on wine imposed in 1984, now 12 cents per gallon, supports the state Missouri Wine and Grape Program, which provides scientific and marketing support for Missouri wines. The state hired a viticulturalist to assist in restoring the wine industry. Missouri State University&#x27;s fruit experiment station began working with winemakers to determine grape varieties suitable for Missouri&#x27;s climate. The state government hopes to encourage the local wine industry by promoting Missouri regionalism: integrating grape agriculture with winemaking, the restaurant business, and tourism.

Missouri State University&#x27;s Mountain Grove Cellars, part of the Missouri State University - Mountain Grove Campus Fruit Experimentation Station - is a wholly university-owned and operated wine grape producing vineyard.

The University of Missouri&#x27;s Grape and Wine Institute (GWI) researches best winemaking and grape growing practices and how they impact the growth of the wine industry in Missouri and the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://gwi.missouri.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Missouri has had some interest in developing a grape-growing education program. Many of the grape growers and winemakers received some instruction from California universities to supplement their studies.

<text>Pisgah Crater, or Pisgah Volcano, is a young volcanic cinder cone rising above a lava plain in the Mojave Desert, between Barstow and Needles, California in San Bernardino County, California. The volcanic peak is around south of historic U.S. Route 66-National Old Trails Highway and of Interstate 40, and west of the town of Ludlow. The volcano had a historic elevation of , but has been reduced to due to mining.

==History==
The volcano was the site of the Mount Pisgah Volcanic Cinders Mine, a cinder quarry that produced pumice for commercial use, the primary end product being railroad ballast for the Santa Fe Railroad. The mountain is currently owned by Can-Cal Resources Limited, a Canadian company specializing in exploration of precious minerals in California.

Mining has had a severe environmental impact; the top of the mountain has been removed and the sides of this historically symmetrical mountain have been scoured into an irregular shape. The mountain is still occasionally quarried for various cinder products, and sand from the mountain was used to depict the black sands of Iwo Jima in the film &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;.

==Geography==

Currently, the crater stands 98 meters (321 feet) above the surrounding High Desert terrain, and has a base diameter of 488 meters (1,600 feet). It has lost much of its original cinder cone shape to ongoing aggregate mining operations, in addition to minor natural erosion.

The mountain contains a large number of lava tubes, which are frequented by cavers. The most well known cave is the -long SPJ Cave.

Located in the Basin and Range Province, the Mojave Valley and then the Cady Mountains lie to the north of the peak, while the Rodman Mountains lie to the west. The Lava Bed Mountains lie to the south, and the Bullion Mountains lie to the southeast.

===Recreation===
The crater and much of the surrounding lava field are on private property. Despite this, the lava tubes in the area are a somewhat popular and easily accessible destination for caving. Historic Lavic Siding is to the east, with the Mojave National Preserve beyond.

==Geology==
There is no reliable date of when Pisgah Crater last erupted. Some believe that Pisgah Volcano is the youngest vent, of four cinder cones, in the Lavic Lake volcanic field. There may have been activity at this site as recently as 2,000 years ago; however others believe that the last eruption occurred as early as 20,000 to 50,000 years ago. It is too young for the potassium-argon dating technique, commonly used on specimens over 100,000 years old; as the volcano is basaltic, finding a reliable source of potassium for dating purposes would be difficult anyway. No charred organic material for radiocarbon dating has been found.

Lava at nearby and similarly active Amboy Crater is interbedded with Bristol Playa sediments at a depth of about 9 meters (30 feet) which are approximately 100,000 years old. Recent argon-argon dating reveals an age of approximately 18,000 years ± 5,000 years (~90% certainty) for the most recent flow. dating with chlorine surface exposure gave a somewhat similar age of 22,500 ± 2,600 years

Lava flows extend to the west and to southeast of the cone, containing basalt primarily of the pahoehoe texture, with some a&#x27;a. The flows contain numerous lava tubes and caves. The cindercone volcano itself shows signs of oxidization prominent in the reddish/orange/brown appearance of much of the upper portions.

The volcano is a very popular field site for geology instruction. On some weekends, it is not uncommon to find university classes and professional seminar groups around the mountain. Quarrying operations and geological survey activity also occurs at the mountain every so often.

===Eruptive history===
The volcano erupted at least three times, emptying the magma chamber below. All three eruptions produced porphyritic basalt, although rocks from the first eruptive phase are almost aphanitic. The first eruption was a basaltic flow that created the extensive lava fields visible from Interstate 40. Due to evidence from intrusive structures, it is believed that the cinder cone was formed around this time, although rocks from this eruptive phase are not present on the surface of the cinder cone. The second phase produced similarly extensive flows, while the third eruption produced substantial amounts of tephra. It is believed that most of the present cinder cone consists of pyroclastic material that originated from this final eruption.

===Composition===
The lava found around the volcano consists of a&#x27;a and pahoehoe, with considerable concentrations of olivine (weathering to iddingsite) and plagioclase. Large amounts of gypsum can be found coating rocks near the cinder cone.

<text>Georg Clemens Perthes (17 January 1869 – 3 January 1927) was a German surgeon and X-ray diagnostic pioneer.

==Biography==
Perthes was born in Moers, Kingdom of Prussia. In 1891 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Bonn, and later was a surgeon in Bonn and Leipzig where he worked with Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924). In 1910 he succeeded Paul von Bruns (1846–1916) as head of the surgical clinic at Tübingen. In 1900–01 he was a military surgeon at the German colonial seaport of Qingdao, China.

Perthes&#x27; primary area of research involved radiological treatment and therapy. He pioneered the use of radiology for the treatment of warts, skin cancer and breast carcinomas. Today he is best known for a child illness named Perthes&#x27; disease, also known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, a disease causing avascular necrosis of the hip joint. Perthes took the first X-rays of a patient with this syndrome in 1898; however, his findings weren&#x27;t published until several years later. While in Qingdao, he had the opportunity to perform radiological studies on the feet of Chinese women that had been subjected to the traditional practice of being crushed and bound.

As a surgeon Perthes made several contributions, including a procedure of suction drainage for empyema, and the use of a pneumatic cuff for hemostasis during limb surgeries. Also, a test for evaluating the competence of deep femoral veins prior to varicose vein surgery is called the &quot;Perthes test&quot; (this test is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Delbet–Mocquot test&quot;, named after French physicians Pierre Delbet and Pierre Mocquot. Perthes died of a stroke in 1927 in Arosa, Switzerland.

<doc id="1169893" wikidata="Q1383576" url="?curid=1169893" title="Moro reflex">
<text>The Moro reflex is an infantile reflex that develops between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation and disappears at 3–6 months of age. It is a response to a sudden loss of support and involves three distinct components:
# spreading out the arms (abduction)
# pulling the arms in (adduction)
# crying (usually)

It is distinct from the startle response. Unlike the startle response, the Moro reflex does not decrease with repeated stimulation. The primary significance of the Moro reflex is in evaluating integration of the central nervous system.

== Eliciting the Moro reflex ==
Ernst Moro elicited the Moro reflex by slapping the pillow on both sides of the infant&#x27;s head. Other methods have been used since then, including rapidly lowering the infant (while supported) to a sudden stop and pinching the skin of the abdomen. Today, the most common method is the head drop, where the infant is supported in both hands and tilted suddenly so the head is a few centimeters lower than the level of the body.

==Clinical significance ==
The Moro reflex may be observed in incomplete form in premature birth after the 25th week of gestation, and is usually present in complete form by week 30 (third trimester). Absence or asymmetry of either abduction or adduction by 2 to 3 months age can be regarded as abnormal, as can persistence of the reflex in infants older than 6 months. Furthermore, absence during the neonatal period may warrant assessment for the possibility of developmental complications such as birth injury or interference with brain formation. Asymmetry of the Moro reflex is especially useful to note, as it is almost always a feature of root, plexus, or nerve disease.

The Moro reflex is impaired or absent in infants with kernicterus.

An exaggerated Moro reflex can be seen in infants with severe brain damage that occurred in-utero, including microcephaly and hydranencephaly. Exaggeration of the Moro reflex, manifesting either as low threshold or excessive clutching, often occurs in newborns with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The Moro reflex is also exaggerated in infants withdrawing from narcotics.

Persistence of the Moro reflex beyond 6 months of age is noted only in infants with severe neurological defects, including cerebral palsy.

==History==
The Moro reflex was first described in western medicine by Austrian pediatrician Ernst Moro (1874–1951) in 1918. Moro referred to it as the Umklammerungsreflex (embracing reflex). In this publication, he stated: &quot;When a young infant is placed on the examination table and one taps with hands on both sides of the pillow, there follows a rapid symmetrical extending abduction of both extremities, which approach each other in adduction immediately thereafter&quot;. According to him, this reflex should disappear after the infant&#x27;s first 3–6 months of life. Since then, the Moro reflex has been used to detect early neurological problems in infants. Absence or prolonged retention of Moro reflex can be signs that the infants need neurological attention.

==Function==
The Moro reflex may be a survival instinct to help the infant cling to its mother. If the infant lost its balance, the reflex caused the infant to embrace its mother and regain its hold on the mother’s body. The Moro reflex might also be an alarm signal from the baby who is about to lose support, and the spread arms provide extremities for where to be grabbed by its handler to prevent a fall.

<doc id="1169902" wikidata="Q7834917" url="?curid=1169902" title="Transport during the British Industrial Revolution">
<text>Transportation of goods to factories, and of finished products from them, was limited by high transport costs along roads to their destinations. This was not too severe in the case of light valuable materials such as textiles (woolen and linen cloth) but in the case of dense materials such as coal, it could be a limiting factor on the viability of an industry. In contrast, freighting goods by water, whether on rivers or coastwise was much cheaper. Canals brought the first major change to transportation, and were usually built directly from the mines to city centres, such as the famous Bridgewater Canal in Manchester. Tramways were also common using horses locomotion. 

==River navigations==

Some rivers, such as the Thames, Severn and Trent were naturally navigable, at least in their lower reaches. 

Other rivers were improved during the 17th and early 18th centuries, improving the transport links of towns such as Manchester, Wigan, Hereford, and Newbury in England. However, these only provided links towards the coast, not across the heart of England. It was the canals which were to provide the vital links in the transport network. This however changed the perspective on how people viewed the world.
==Turnpike trusts==

In England, the roads of each parish were maintained by compulsory labour from the parishioners, six days per year. This proved inadequate in the case of certain heavily used roads, and from the 18th century (and in a few cases slightly earlier), statutory bodies of trustees began to be set up with power to borrow money to repair and improve roads, the loans being repaid from tolls collected from road users. In the 1750s there was a boom in creating new turnpike trusts with the result that by the end of the 18th century almost all main roads were turnpike roads. Each trust required an Act of Parliament, both on its initial creation and to renew it when the term granted by the Act expired. Cars were invented in the 1800&#x27;s.

==Railways==

These railways were all horse-drawn, though in many cases their slope meant that the horse was not required to draw the wagon downhill; instead, it was necessary to apply a brake to slow the descent. The wagon was emptied into a river barge (or keel or trow), and the horse drew the empty wagon back to the coal pit. Steam engine haulage was tried by Richard Trevithick on the Merthyr Tramroad from Penydarren to Abercynon in 1804, but proved unsatisfactory, partly because the engine was too heavy for the rails. It was only after the development of stronger rails made of rolled wrought iron in the 1820s that steam engine-hauled long-distance railways became feasible. Like the early wagonways, these were (indeed are) edge railways, where the wheels of the engine and wagons (or carriages) are flanged. Thus followed the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and many more. People were able to use railways to get to factory work and jobs much more effectively than previous options.

- In 1829 George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson built a locomotive called “the rocket”

<text>In economics, the concept of returns to scale arises in the context of a firm&#x27;s production function. It explains the long-run linkage of increase in output (production) relative to associated increases in the inputs (factors of production).

In the long run, all factors of production are variable and subject to change in response to a given increase in production scale. In other words, returns to scale analysis is a long-term theory because a company can only change the scale of production in the long run by changing factors of production, such as building new facilities, investing in new machinery, or improving technology.

There are three possible types of returns to scale:
* If output increases by the same proportional change as all inputs change then there are constant returns to scale (CRS). For example, when inputs (labor and capital) increase by 100%, output increases by 100%.
* If output increases by less than the proportional change in all inputs, there are decreasing returns to scale (DRS). For example, when inputs (labor and capital) increase by 100%, the increase in output is less than 100%. The main reason for the decreasing returns to scale is the increased management difficulties associated with the increased scale of production, the lack of coordination in all stages of production, and the resulting decrease in production efficiency.
* If output increases by more than the proportional change in all inputs, there are increasing returns to scale (IRS). For example, when inputs (labor and capital) increase by 100%, the increase in output is greater than 100%. The main reason for the increasing returns to scale is the increase in production efficiency due to the expansion of the firm&#x27;s production scale.

A firm&#x27;s production function could exhibit different types of returns to scale in different ranges of output. Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at some range of output levels between those extremes.

In mainstream microeconomics, the returns to scale faced by a firm are purely technologically imposed and are not influenced by economic decisions or by market conditions (i.e., conclusions about returns to scale are derived from the specific mathematical structure of the production function &quot;in isolation&quot;). As production scales up, companies can use more advanced and sophisticated technologies, resulting in more streamlined and specialised production within the company.

==Example==

When the usages of all inputs increase by a factor of 2, new values for output will be:

* Twice the previous output if there are constant returns to scale (CRS)
* Less than twice the previous output if there are decreasing returns to scale (DRS)
* More than twice the previous output if there are increasing returns to scale (IRS)

Assuming that the factor costs are constant (that is, that the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets) and the production function is homothetic, a firm experiencing constant returns will have constant long-run average costs, a firm experiencing decreasing returns will have increasing long-run average costs, and a firm experiencing increasing returns will have decreasing long-run average costs. However, this relationship breaks down if the firm does not face perfectly competitive factor markets (i.e., in this context, the price one pays for a good does depend on the amount purchased). For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input&#x27;s per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

==Formal definitions==

Formally, a production function formula_1 is defined to have:
* Constant returns to scale if (for any constant &quot;a&quot; greater than 0): formula_2. In this case, the function formula_3 is homogeneous of degree 1.
* Decreasing returns to scale if (for any constant &quot;a&quot; greater than 1): formula_4
* Increasing returns to scale if (for any constant &quot;a&quot; greater than 1): formula_5
where &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are factors of production—capital and labor, respectively.

In a more general set-up, for a multi-input-multi-output production processes, one may assume technology can be represented via some technology set, call it formula_6, which must satisfy some regularity conditions of production theory. In this case, the property of constant returns to scale is equivalent to saying that technology set formula_6 is a cone, i.e., satisfies the property formula_8. In turn, if there is a production function that will describe the technology set formula_6 it will have to be homogeneous of degree 1.

==Formal example==

If the Cobb–Douglas production function has its general form

:formula_10

with formula_11 then

:formula_12

and, for &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1, there are increasing returns if &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1, constant returns if &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; = 1, and decreasing returns if &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; &lt; 1.

<text>The Laurentides (, ) is a region of Quebec. While it is often called the Laurentians in English, the region includes only part of the Laurentian Mountains. It has a total land area of and its population was 589,400 inhabitants as of the 2016 Census.

The area was historically occupied by the Algonquin First Nation. English Canadians began settling in the 1700s in towns like Arundel and Harrington and St. Columban and Clyde, today&#x27;s La Conception. French Canadians began settlement in the first half of the 19th century, establishing an agricultural presence throughout the valleys. During the 20th century, the area also became a popular tourist destination, based on a cottage and lake culture in the summer, and a downhill and cross-country ski culture in the winter. Ski resorts include Saint-Sauveur and Mont Tremblant.

The Laurentides offer a weekend escape for Montrealers and tourists from New England to Ontario, and with the building of a major highway through the area in the 1970s (Autoroute 15), the area has experienced much growth. Its largest city is Saint-Jérôme, in its extreme southeast, with a 2011 census population of 68,456 inhabitants.

<text>Jared Leigh Cohon (October 7, 1947 – March 16, 2024) was an American academic administrator who served as the eighth president of Carnegie Mellon University beginning 1997 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. he was a University Professor in the Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering.

==Life and career==
Jared Leigh Cohon was born in Cleveland, Ohio on October 7, 1947. He held a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and MS and PhD degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earned in 1972 and 1973, respectively.

Prior to Carnegie Mellon, Cohon was the Dean of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and professor of environmental systems analysis at Yale University from 1992 to 1997 and was a faculty member in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering and Assistant and Associate Dean of Engineering and Vice Provost for Research at Johns Hopkins University from 1973 to 1992.

He became President of Carnegie Mellon in 1997. During his first month of his presidency, he oversaw the removal of a stand of trees to build the Purnell Center for the Arts. He was shocked that there were no student protests against the act.&quot;I&#x27;m worried that our undergraduates can be so focused on preparing for their careers that they fail to develop a sense of and passion for what else is important to them.&quot; –Jared Cohon, 1997 copy of The Thistle, Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s now defunct yearbookCohon stepped down from his position as President of Carnegie Mellon in 2013 and returned to the faculty as a University Professor in the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Engineering and Public Policy and director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon announced that the University Center would be renamed in honor of President Cohon and will be called the Cohon University Center.

Cohon was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (2012) for contributions to environmental systems analysis and national policy and leadership in higher education.

Cohon died on March 16, 2024, at the age of 76.

<text>Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero (born 1 February 1951) is a Nicaraguan American colonel and businessman.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero was born on December 18, 1951, in Miami, Florida, United States. A member of the Somoza family, he is a son of former Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza Debayle and Hope Portocarrero; he is also a grandson of Anastasio Somoza García. Also known as &quot;El Chigüín&quot;—&quot;The little child”—Somoza Portocarrero had been the heir apparent to the Somoza family regime prior to the ouster of his father by the Marxist Sandinistas in 1979. By early 1978, Somoza Portocarrero had reportedly taken on the appellation &quot;apprentice dictator&quot; and assumed full control of the Somozas&#x27; estimated $1 billion business empire, however, by mid-1979 the family had fallen from power and would be forced into exile.

He was educated in the United States, including at Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in England, at Sandhurst. His sister, Carolina, is married to James Minskoff Sterling, son of New York real estate developer Henry H. Minskoff.

===Career===
He became a colonel in the Nicaraguan military, which was run by his family. He played an active role in the armed forces during the Sandinista insurrection, and the National Guard unit which he commanded &quot;was accused of widespread human rights violations in the final days of the civil war.&quot; Like all combatants during the 1979-1989 period, Somoza Portocarrero was included against his wishes in the Blanket Amnesty demanded by the FSLN from incoming President Violeta Chamorro in 1990.

In early 1980, the new Sandinista government formally accused Somoza Portocarrero of masterminding the 1978 assassination of opposition journalist Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, and a June 1981 trial that convicted nine people of the crime implicated him but did not go as far as naming him as a defendant &quot;in absentia&quot;. In 1980, Sandinista officials also issued a warrant for Somoza Portocarrero&#x27;s arrest on charges that he embezzled $4 million in governmental funds (via dummy corporations) while his father was still in power. He was living in Miami at the time, and he was not extradited because the US Department of State considered the charges to be politically motivated and thus allowed the matter to die.

False reports that Somoza Portocarrero might return to Nicaragua in 2000 after over twenty years in exile led to an uproar in that country. Former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega suggested that Somoza Portocarrero &quot;will be able to enter Managua, but I doubt he will be able to leave because I will confront him with gunshots.&quot; Sitting President Arnoldo Alemán—whose own political party in part grew out of the old Somoza party—said that Nicaraguans &quot;reject the announced visit of Somoza Portocarrero, whom public opinion considers one of those principally responsible for the destruction, suffering, violations and spilling of blood dramatically suffered by Nicaraguans throughout their history.&quot; Somoza Portocarrero was falsely reported to have planned to return for a political rally but ultimately this was found to be invented by Alemán.
