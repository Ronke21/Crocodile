<text>Theale () is a village and civil parish in West Berkshire, England. It is southwest of Reading and 10 miles (16 km) east of Thatcham. The compact parish is bounded to the south and south-east by the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal (which here incorporates the River Kennet), to the north by a golf course, to the east by the M4 motorway and to the west by the A340 road.

==Toponymy==
The name is thought to come from the Old English &quot;þelu&quot; meaning planks. As with the village of Theale in Somerset, this probably refers to planks used to create causeways on marshes or flood plains. A local legend suggests the name Theale refers to the village&#x27;s coaching inns, and its position as the first staging post on the Bath Road out of Reading – literally calling the village The ale.

==History==

===Romans===
The old significance of the position of Theale is that it lay at the junction of two ancient natural routes, one following the Kennet Valley from east to west and another which exploited the valley of the River Pang to run at a low level through the Chiltern Hills from north to south via the Goring Gap. This latter route was taken by a Roman road which ran from Calleva Atrebatum (modern Silchester) north to Dorchester on Thames. Extrapolation of the known alignment from Silchester to near Ufton Nervet indicates a crossing point of the River Kennet just east of Tylemill Bridge. This Roman road has its equivalent in the modern A340 from Theale to Pangbourne.

Roman remains were uncovered during the excavation of the Theale Old Gravel Pit, at the end of St Ives Close, for ten years after 1887. The Kennet Valley route, later the Bath Road, only became important after the foundation of the Anglo-Saxon borough of Reading in the 8th century. The Anglo-Saxons had abandoned Calleva Atrebatum, but the north to south route remained important to them as connecting the royal capital of Winchester with the boroughs of Old Basing near Basingstoke and Wallingford.

===Middle Ages===
From the early Middle Ages to the 19th century, Theale was mostly part of Tilehurst parish. The old parish boundaries around here were complicated, and the village was a chapelry, comprising a western outlier of this large and irregularly shaped parish. The odd parish boundaries by the river indicates that the valley bottom had been converted from swamp forest to flood-meadows or reed-beds for thatching by the start of the second millennium. The portion belonging to Englefield lay between the main river (now the canal) and a branch, called Holy Brook, which left the main course at Sheffield Mill and rejoined it at Reading Abbey. The name was allegedly because the abbey used the brook to power its corn mill and flush its toilets, and so engineered its course to ensure a good head of water.

From before 1241 until the 1800s, Theale, unusually, gave its name to the hundred containing the parishes of Aldermaston, Bradfield, Burghfield, Englefield, Padworth, Purley, Stratfield Mortimer, Sulham, Sulhamstead Bannister, Tidmarsh, Ufton Nervet and Woolhampton. The oddity of this was that the village was not in the hundred, because Tilehurst parish was in the Hundred of Reading. The manor and church of Tilehurst belonged to Reading Abbey in the Middle Ages. However, the chapel at Theale did not but was part of land-holdings in Theale held by the nunnery of Goring Priory by 1291. The nuns also held the neighbouring manor of Sulham, but the chapel had some connection with the church at Englefield.

There is circumstantial evidence of a readjustment of boundaries between Sulham, Englefield and Tilehurst parishes and the possible transfer of Theale in the earlier Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages, the abbey leased out many of its properties to ensure a cash income at a time when the economy was becoming increasingly cash-driven. The large manor of Tilehurst was subdivided, and a &quot;manor&quot;, not actually legally functioning as one, called Beansheaf was in existence by 1390. This was named after a family farming land in the parish in the 13th century. The territory included Theale, but the manor-house was to the east of the present village and the site is now east of the M4, at the north end of Bourne Close. A housing estate in Holybrook parish preserves the name.

===Civil War===
Theale saw action in the English Civil War, (1642–51). On 22 September 1643, soon after the First Battle of Newbury, the village was the site of a skirmish between Prince Rupert&#x27;s Royalist forces and the Earl of Essex&#x27;s Parliamentarians. Rupert attacked the Earl&#x27;s forces from the rear as they were returning to London. According to contemporary reports, the Earl&#x27;s forces – led by Colonel Middleton – held strong; up to 800 Royalist musketeers and 60 horses were killed, and at least eight Parliamentarian units, a minimum of 800 men, were also killed, and were buried on the spot in Deadman&#x27;s Lane. The Royalist forces retreated, and the Earl left Theale on the morning of 23 September, heading to Reading where his forces recovered from fatigue. Thomas Fairfax marched through Theale on 1 May 1645, en route from Windsor to Salisbury. Evidence for the encounter came to light in 1878, when a sword with the remains of an iron hilt was found near Deadman&#x27;s Lane. A housing estate in the south-west quadrant of the village has the street names Cavalier Close and Roundhead Road in memory of this skirmish.

===Road transport===
Stagecoaches began to run through from London to Bath and Bristol in the mid-17th century, soon after the civil war ended. In 1667, the first through coach was advertised as &quot;The Flying Machine&quot; in an advertising poster:
All those desirous to pass from London to Bath, or any other place on their Road, let them repair to the Bell Savage Inn on Ludgate Hill in London and the White Lion Inn at Bath, at both which places they may be received in a Stage Coach every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which performs the whole journey in Three Days (if God permit), and sets forth at five in the morning. Passengers to pay One Pound five Shillings each. In response to increased traffic, the first section of the Bath Road, between Reading and Theale, was made into a turnpike by Act of Parliament in 1714. The rest of the road from London to Bristol was to follow in the next four decades, leading to a golden age of coach travel.

As the Bath Road thus became an established trade route and turnpike between the south-west and south-east of England, Theale became a staging post and as such was known for its numerous coaching inns. A stage was the distance a coach would run before changing horses, and the staging post was where the horses were rested and refreshed before doing the stage again in the opposite direction. A stage was usually seven to fifteen miles long, depending on topography, so Reading to Theale, at five miles, was a short stage and would have taken an hour. The 18th century highwayman, Dick Turpin, is said to have hidden in a secret room in The Old Lamb inn on Church Street on numerous occasions. In 1802, topographer James Baker chronicled the village, en route from Reading to Newbury, and described it as &quot;inconsiderable&quot;. However, the wealth engendered by a continued growth in road traffic meant that the village entered its most prosperous era, expanding substantially in the earlier 19th century before the arrival of the railway. The growth of the village led to the creation of a separate ecclesiastical parish and the consecration of a new church in 1832.

The road came back to life with the invention of the motor car, and the new status of the Bath Road as London&#x27;s highway to Bristol was demonstrated on 23 April 1900, when the Automobile Club held a motor car reliability demonstration involving a cavalcade from London to Calcot Park, the home of Alfred Harmsworth who sponsored the event. Calcot Park was then just north of Theale parish. For the next seventy years, all the motor traffic between London, Reading and Bristol passed along Theale High Street. The development response was slow, however, and only two small housing estates were developed in the inter-war period. The first was Lambfields west of the church, and the second comprised Blossom Avenue and The Crescent in the north. Lambfields was named after the Old Lamb inn.

===Canal===

The Kennet Navigation opened in 1723 from Reading to Newbury. The Kennet and Avon Canal, extending from Newbury to Bath, was opened in 1810. Theale had its wharf at a location called Sheffield, in Burghfield parish and next to Sheffield Lock. Here, the road to Burghfield village crosses the canal by a single-lane swing bridge, now controlled by traffic lights. The canal was locally re-opened from the Thames at Reading to Hungerford wharf in July 1974. However, full restoration of the entire length to Bath was only completed in 2004. In 1983, West Berkshire Council declared the Sheffield Bridge Conservation Area to protect the swing bridge, Sheffield Lock and Sheffield Mill. In 2000, the canal towpath became part of National Cycle Route 4. It has the legal status of a cruiseway, a waterway devoted to recreational boat traffic, since 2011.

===Railway===

On 21 December 1847, the Great Western Railway opened railway station on the northern branch of the Berks and Hants Railway, from to . This immediately halted the coach traffic and the turnpike road company&#x27;s income, and crippled the canal company which had to slash rates and be henceforth content with limited local traffic. The canal sold out to the railway in 1852, which maintained it in operation until 1951. Then, a collapsed aqueduct closed it as a through route, although it was never formally abandoned. The railway line was extended to in 1864, and became part of a new direct GWR main line to Devon and Cornwall in 1906. Theale would have been one of the towns and villages dependent on the coaching trade, for which the arrival of a railway was a disaster. This is shown by successive editions of the Ordnance Survey, which show that the village entered stasis and did not grow until the 20th century.

From 1847 to the early years of the 20th century, the village had to make do economically with local farming, a brewery and gravel extraction. The last named was, however, greatly facilitated by the railway and a large pit near the village, Theale Old Gravel Pit, opened in 1887 with its own railway siding. The 1898 Ordnance Survey map also shows a small gasworks next to the station, and a ropewalk off Station Road near its junction with the High Street. There is evidence that local farmers were growing hemp to make into rope. The railway to Devizes was closed in 1963, and Theale lost its local service to that town.

===Airfield===
RAF Theale is a former Second World War RAF training facility located on Sheffield Farm, just east of the canal swing bridge, and actually in Burghfield parish. It was opened in 1944, with two grass runways, and used for training by No. 26 Elementary Flying Training School, and, later in the same year, by No. 128 Gliding School. The training school used twenty-four de Havilland Tiger Moths. The canal by the airfield was fortified with pillboxes, one of which is a listed building.

===Motorway===
After the opening of the railway, the next major change for the village was the opening of the M4 motorway on 22 December 1971. The High Street went from having an enormous amount of traffic passing through, to none. Junction 12 on the motorway was built just east of the village. The old road was cut and a footbridge was provided. A new dual carriageway bypass was built from the junction, running south of the village to the A340. A short link road, Hoad Way, was provided from this to the east end of the High Street. The new transport link led to major development in the village. The area between the bypass and railway was zoned for industrial and warehouse development. Two substantial new housing estates were added to the village, Woodfield Way in the north-east and Meadow Way in the south-west. The narrow strip of land between the High Street and the bypass was infilled with blocks of flats. As a precautionary preservation measure, in 1971, the Rural District Council declared three conservation areas: Theale High Street/Blossom Lane, Holy Trinity, Theale and The Lamb, Theale. In 1984, after it was realised that several of the buildings in the High Street were 17th century, a total of 32 buildings in the parish were given listed building status. All are Grade II, except the church, which is Grade I, and Garston Lock, Grade II*.

==Governance==
Until 1894, Theale was a chapelry and tithing territory in the parish of Tilehurst. Then, Theale civil parish was created. The new parish was included in Bradfield Rural District Council. However, in 1974 the rural district became part of Newbury District Council which, in turn became the unitary authority of West Berkshire.

==Geography==
===Topography===
The landscape of the present parish is relatively flat, with expanses of level ground flanking the main road. It is dominated by the built-up area of the village. This is residential north of the bypass, and commercial south of it. To the north of the village there is a golf course, and to the west are a few large fields owned by the Englefield Estate. There were many wooded areas within the old parish before 2000, but these have been annexed by neighbouring parishes and the only named wood left is a tiny fragment in the south-east corner of the golf course next to the M4 called Further Clayhill Copse. The River Kennet runs south of the village, and is joined by the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal with two sets of locks and weirs (Garston and Sheffield Locks).

It used to cut through meadows occupying a wide flood plain, but these were dug out in the 20th century for gravel extraction and so replaced by a mosaic of lakes. The south-east and south boundary of the parish is now the canal. Just the other side, in Burghfield and Sulhamstead parishes, one of these lakes is now a Local nature reserve called Hosehill Lake. Theale village has one lake within its residential built-up area to the far west, with privately owned houses flanking it on its north side but recreational walking possible to the south. Two further such lakes are in a business park in the extreme south-east corner of the parish.

===Geology===
As with other parts of the Kennet Valley, soil in Theale is a variety of chalk, flint, gravel, clay, alluvium and loam. The village is on a broad gravel terrace, the gravel deriving from flints weathered out of the bedrock of chalk. The chalk outcrops in the hills to the north, with pockets of clay. The river flood plain is covered with alluvium, over beds of more gravel. The loam occurs where chalk and clay have weathered together. There have been narrow peat marshes along the river, marking the locations of former oxbow lakes. Samples of ochra purpurco-rubra, a purple-red type of ochre used by painters, have been found in clay pits in the village. This is a form of haematite iron ore.

===Layout and fabric===
Theale before the 20th century was an early example of ribbon development, in that the built-up area was a long strip along the Bath Road with no side streets. The layout focuses on the crossroads formed by the High Street (east), Church Street (west), Blossom Lane (north) and Station Road (south). The High Street is completely built up with mainly Victorian edifices in red brick, some in patterned brickwork and some rendered in lime plaster. It is a conservation area. Listed buildings earlier in date are 1, 4, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 43–5, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 58, 60. Of these, seventeenth-century timber framed buildings are 29, 33, 35 and 52; the others are Georgian or Regency. 29, 31 and 47 are old coaching inns (31 still open as The Falcon). 49 has an unusual Gothic door-case.

Before the 20th century, Church Street was not completely built up but had clusters of buildings separated by paddocks. The village ended at the hamlet of Theale Green. Englefield Road branches north-westwards before the church, leading to the health centre, the Roman Catholic church and the Englefied Estate office at the junction with Deadman&#x27;s Lane. The church, churchyard wall, churchyard gate, the Old Rectory, the Old Rectory Cottage (former coach house) and the Webb Tomb in the churchyard are all listed buildings. The church is the focus of its own conservation area.

Church Street continues beyond the church to the Theale Church of England Primary School, the library, Theale Green School and the St John Ambulance Centre. Listed buildings] are 1–3, 2, 18-20 27, 29 and 49. No 2 is the Crown Inn, a heavily altered 17th-century coaching inn formerly with a coach horse paddock opposite, where a car dealer now is. 18-20 is the Old Lamb, a former coaching inn which is now a hotel. It is the only thatched building in Theale, and is a 17th-century timber-framed edifice abutted by a large early 19th-century annexe. Dick Turpin stayed here and there is allegedly a ghost, but Historic England rejects the date of 1487 painted on the façade. The Old Lamb is easily confused with the Lamb next door at number 22, a pub in polychrome brickwork which closed down in 2012. The Old Lamb has its own conservation area, which includes a small housing estate called Lambfields. This was built in the 1920s, the first in the village, and features high-quality tile-hung semi-detached houses in a vernacular style.
Before the 20th century, Blossoms Lane ran to a hamlet called Blossoms End and ended at Blossomsend Farm, now a golf course. The road is now Crown Lane, leading to Blossom Lane. The High Street conservation area includes Crown Lane and lower Blossom Lane, protecting Victorian houses with polychrome brickwork. Station Road leads through the industrial and commercial area, under the 1971 bypass bridge to the railway station, then on to the swing bridge over the canal at the Sheffield Bridge conservation area. This contains Sheffield Mill, Sheffield Lock and a pillbox, all listed. This lock has unusual scalloped walls. Garston Lock, to the east is Grade II* listed because it is a very rare turf-sided lock. The parish boundary is at the bridge, although the Fox and Hounds pub at Sheffield Bottom further on has a Theale postal address. The smallest listed building in Theale is on the A340 just south of the Bradfield Road crossroads. It is an 18th-century milestone in the form of a short column, reading &quot;TO BASINGSTOKE 15; TO WALLINGFORD 13; TO OXFORD 26&quot;.

==Economy==
===Pubs===

Theale has long been associated with pubs and the brewing trade. Many coaching inns were established on the Bath Road, though by the 1840s, the success of the Great Western Railway had considerably reduced the volume of custom the inns received. In 1843, writing about the effect of the railway on local business and environment, J G Robertson hypothesised that &quot;it is probable that, in a few months, the completion of the Great Western Railway will totally annihilate the agreeable variety, and the hanging woods of Englefield and Beenham will no longer echo back the nocturnal challenge of the mail-guard&#x27;s horn&quot;.

By 1854, the village&#x27;s old coaching inns had either closed down or become ordinary inns and pubs. The survivors were: the White Hart, on the eastern outskirts, at Pincents Lane, and demolished in 1969; the Bull; the Falcon; the Castle and the Crown. The Castle vanished in 1907. In 1939, only the Crown was offering accommodation. On the other hand, the village then had the Railway Arms next to the station, since demolished; the Bridge House Inn, next to the canal, now closed and, on Church Street, the Red Lion, closed 2014; the Lamb, closed 2012 and the Volunteer.

===Blatch&#x27;s Theale Brewery===

The village business with the highest public profile in the later 19th and earlier 20th century was Blatch&#x27;s Theale Brewery, located in premises off the High Street. The brewery began operations in 1752, and was acquired by the Blatch Brothers, William, Henry and Frank, in 1854. The family went on to create an estate of twenty-two public houses in west Berkshire and north Hampshire, including the Bull, which was the tap house. The firm sold its beer under the trademark of a stylised ear of barley. There was also a bottling plant, and bottled beers were Pale Ale, Brown Ale, &quot;B.B.&quot;, XXXX – a barley wine and Genuine Stout. The company gave up brewing in 1959 but bought in beer from Wadworth Brewery in Devizes to sell under its own label.

This continued until the death of Harold Blatch, the last chief executive officer of the family, in 1965. His heirs immediately sold out to Allied Breweries trading as Ind Coope in 1965, and the beer brands were terminated. The brewery buildings were not sold and some survive, converted to offices, as Brewery Court. The company offices were at 43 High Street, a listed building, and the Bull tap house adjacent is now owned by Wadworth Brewery. Local competition in the village before the Second World War came from H &amp; G Simonds Brewery of Reading which owned the Falcon and the Bridge House Inn by the canal, and from Strange&#x27;s Brewery at Aldermaston Wharf, which owned the Crown and the White Hart. The street name, Blatch&#x27;s Close, commemorates the firm.

===Pincents Kiln===
Theale was once involved in Tilehurst&#x27;s tile industry; until at least the late 19th century there was a kiln to the north-east of the village. Pincents Kiln exploited the proximity of chalk to a pocket of clay to make lime cement as well as bricks and tiles. The site is now a business park to the east of the M4. Some of the buildings in the High Street have old tiled roofs.

===Gravel===
Gravel extraction was confined to small pits on the exposed gravel terrace of the village until the arrival of the railway. A large pit was opened in 1887 in the west of the village, with a railway spur. This pit was deep enough to flood as a lake, but subsequent work proceeding westwards down the Bath Road involved shallow stripping of the gravel above the water table. The Theale and Great Western Sand and Gravel Co was incorporated as a limited company in 1928, and was taken over by the Wraysbury Sand and Gravel Co in 1955. The rail-served Theale Aggregate Depot on Wigmore Lane remains in operation, although the material comes from other sources. The gravel under the alluvium of the river valley was massively exploited after the Second World War, with a peak of activity in the 1950s, with intensive gravel extraction along the River Kennet, which created a series of huge pits south of the railway, four miles long from south of the A340 junction to the railway to Basingstoke. These filled up with water after exhaustion, and became a series of large lakes. There is no extractive activity in the parish now.

The Old Gravel Pit in the village was already attracting the attention of birdwatchers by 1935. The flooded workings attracted much bird life, including rarities, and became nationally famous as a birdwatching destination. The Theale cluster comprised the Wigmore Lane Gravel Pits, Bottom Lane Gravel Pits, Hosehill Pit, Theale Main Pit and Arrow Head Pit. In 1988, the Theale Area Bird Conservation Group was founded, and in 1997 this took over the abandoned Hosehill Pit which became a local nature reserve under the name of Hosehill Lake. This is now under the management of the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.

===Theale Motor Company===
The car showroom on the corner of Church Street and Station Road is run by Theale Motor Company, a descendant of a very early garage and car repair business. The Theale Motor and Engineering Co was established, on the former coach horse paddock of the Crown opposite, by the First World War.

===Business Parks===
Five business parks adjoin the railway station. Those north of the railway are, west to east: Theale Technology Centre, Theale Business Park and Arlington Business Park. South of the railway are The Markham Centre (west) and Kennet Weir Business Park (east). Koch Media has its United Kingdom offices in Theale, at Arlington Business Park. Nokia UK opened its south east office in the same park in 2018.

==Transport==
===Railway===

 has a railway station on the Reading to Taunton line; the station has been in operation since 1847. Until 2013, the layout consisted of two platforms, the eastbound to via Southcote Junction and and the westbound to via , , , and . Some trains run past Newbury to , and . Until 1963, local services ran to via the so-called Devizes branch line which was closed in that year. The station had a siding for general goods (freight) services on the north side to the east of its yard, and a pub called the &quot;Railway Arms&quot; at the yard entrance. Aggregate traffic (sand and gravel) used a terminal to the west, and this remains open.

The pub was demolished to build &quot;Brunel Way&quot; for the &quot;Theale Business Park&quot;. In 2013, a station upgrade was begun. The goods siding was replaced by a third platform on a new loop of track, and a car park for 215 places provided. Unfortunately, the project then stalled for legal reasons after all the old buildings had been demolished, and the completion date is estimated as 2024. Meanwhile, there is no disabled access because the platforms can only be reached via stairs from the road bridge. Trains are operated by the Great Western Railway, and comprise a basic service of two trains an hour. One is a local -, and one is a through London -.

===Buses===
After the opening of the M4 motorway removed all long-distance bus and coach traffic in 1971, the village&#x27;s bus services consisted of a direct Reading to Newbury route, along the A4 road, and village routes between the same two towns running north and south of the main road west of Theale. These were operated by Reading Buses, the village ones being public services receiving a council subsidy. The direct route is covered by the &quot;Jet Black&quot; bus service, instigated by Reading Buses between Newbury and Reading along the A4 road; the journey time is about 50 minutes to Newbury and 30 to Reading, with two buses an hour being the basic service.

In 2011, Reading Buses withdrew from providing subsidised services in the Newbury area. The &quot;Newbury &amp; District Bus Company&quot;, then owned by &quot;Weavaway Travel&quot;, took these on. Also, the Reading firm contracted &quot;Weavaway&quot; to run &quot;Jetblack&quot; -although without changing the bus livery. In 2018, Reading Buses took over &quot;Newbury &amp; District Bus&quot;, and again dropped the village services. These were recast and reduced, being taken on by the &quot;West Berkshire Council Transport Services Team&quot; under the banner of &quot;Connect&quot;. The services are: 41 Newbury to Theale (Crown) via Chapel Row and Beenham, two to Theale and one from Theale daily, and 44 Thatcham to Calcot Sainsburys via Brimpton and Theale, one journey Mondays and Wednesdays. Theale has two football bus services, running when Reading Football Club are playing at home at Madejski Stadium. F20 passes through from Newbury, and F23 starts in the village to run via Pangbourne.

===Motoring===
Theale is just south-west of junction 12 of the M4 motorway; where the junction signs direct motorists to &quot;Theale, Reading West&quot;. The motorway here was opened in 1971, simultaneously with a village bypass that runs south of the village. Part of the old road was suppressed for the motorway. After 1971, the name &quot;Bath Road&quot; was given to the bypass. The first roundabout from the motorway on this leads to the village on the right via Hoad Way, and &quot;Arlington Business Park&quot; on the left via Waterside Drive. There is a Pay and display car park off the High Street, just east of the junction with Hoad Way.

===Canal===

The Kennet and Avon Canal is a statutory &quot;cruiseway&quot; for recreational boat traffic. Sheffield Bridge has a car park and picnic area, but no other facilities as the &quot;Bridge House Inn&quot; is defunct. The canal towpath is a statutory footpath, and also part of the &quot;Sustrans&quot; National Cycle Route 4 of the National Cycle Network, a long-distance cycle route from London to Fishguard in Wales. The towpath is not a statutory bridle path and has no horses.

==Education==
The village has a Church of England primary school, founded in 1814, when the Rev. Thomas Sheppard bequeathed a trust fund generating £20 a year for a school &quot;to learn poor children to read …and to instruct them their duty to God as taught by the church catechism, and our excellent Liturgy&quot;, as he wrote. The school had occupied the same site next to the church from 1833 but in 2018 the parish council approved plans by West Berkshire Council to build a larger school on part of the North Street playing fields. The new school opened in the summer of 2020. Theale Green Community School is a comprehensive secondary school and arts college located to the west of the village and has a specialist department catering for students on the autism spectrum. The school&#x27;s catchment area covers Woolhampton, Bradfield, Beenham, Englefield and Basildon.

==Places of worship==
===Medieval Chapel of Ease===
There is documentary evidence from 1291 of a chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist at Theale, belonging to the nunnery of Goring Priory at Goring-on-Thames. This monastery also owned the adjacent manor of Sulham. In the 19th century, villager A. Harrison of the &quot;Berkshire Local History Club&quot; wrote that the chapel was on the same site as the current church, and that it had some connection with Englefield church. The club was a private antiquarian society, the members of which passed notes about the history of their respective localities to each other.

In 1542, after Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries, the chapel was granted to Sir Leonard Chamberlain (the High Sheriff of Berkshire) and to Richard Andrews. The following year, it was transferred to the Burgoyne family by Chamberlain and Richard Hayles. In 1545 the Burgoyne family sold the chapel to Richard Bartlett, who in turn sold it to Humphrey Forster of Aldermaston in 1587. In 1609, Forster&#x27;s son sold the property to Anthony Blagrave of Sonning, from whom the Wilder family purchased it in 1632. The last mention of the chapel as a working place of worship is a reference dated 1675 in the family&#x27;s deeds. The old chapel edifice was reportedly demolished in 1808, with evidence of its foundations being discovered in the building of the present church.

===New Chapel of Ease===
In 1799 Rev Thomas Sheppard built a new chapel of ease, at a time when Theale was still part of Tilehurst Parish. He held the advowson of Tilehurst church, and so had the authority to order this. The chapel was built of brick, had a bellcote, and was situated to the south-west of the present church., So, for almost a decade two chapel edifices stood near to each other.

=== Holy Trinity Church ===

Holy Trinity Church, is a Church of England parish church in the Diocese of Oxford. It was completed in 1832 in the Early English style, influenced by Salisbury Cathedral. The church is a Grade I listed building.

===St Luke&#x27;s Church===
The Roman Catholic church of St Luke is a modern building on Englefield Road. This is the only other place of worship in the village. It is a subsidiary church of the Catholic parish of Woolhampton, and is run by Douai Abbey. The plan is based on an elongated pentagon, and the walls are in red brick. The roof has five pitches meeting at a tall, thin spire in white.

===Nonconformity===
There are now no Nonconformist congregations in the village. The Congregational church founded a congregation in Theale in about 1875. This took over the &quot;Angel&quot; Inn in the High Street in 1913, demolished the allegedly 16th-century building and built a chapel. This closed in 1996, and was itself replaced by apartments called &quot;Angel Court&quot; in 2007. The Primitive Methodist Church founded a chapel in the village at 59 High Street about 1868, which survived until 1992. It was demolished for &quot;Beaumont House&quot;, but a stone plaque in the wall of this commemorates it.

==Sport and recreation==
There is a public meeting hall run by the parish council, the John Cumber Hall, at 38a High Street. The village has its Recreation Ground on the Englefield Road. This is home to the Theale and Tilehurst Cricket Club which play in the Thames Valley Cricket League. Here also is the main village hall, home to the Theale Club which is a social club with a bar. A small skatepark is located here. The North Street Playing Fields is a separate location on the other side of the road. It is used by the Theale Tigers Youth Football Club, but part of it was released for a new primary school in 2018. The Theale Golf Club has an 18-hole golf course to the north of the village, the club house being approached via a driveway from Englefield Road. It was laid out in 1996. &quot;Pay and Play&quot; is available, as are day tickets and twilight rates. Dr Ellerton&#x27;s Charity Allotments are a large set of allotments off Meadow Way. They were established by a private charity, Dr Ellerton&#x27;s Charity which was founded in 1899 to help poor people in the parish. Theale Water Sports Club has power-boating and waterskiing on the Main Gravel Pit.

<text>Patrick James Lindsay (18 January 1914 – 29 June 1993) was an Irish politician and lawyer.

==Early life==
He was born in 1914 in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, the eldest of three sons and four daughters of Patrick Lindsay, post office worker, and his wife Mary (née Keegan). Before his second birthday, the family returned to their native County Mayo, settling in the village of Doolough, Kiltane parish, Erris. He received his primary education at Gweesalia national school, and attended secondary school at St. Muiredach&#x27;s College, Ballina. He subsequently attended University College Galway, where he studied ancient classics, between 1933 and 1937, graduating with an M.A. He was a noted figure in the college – a gifted orator, he served on the committee of the Literary and Debating Society, and took part in the productions of the Drama Society. He was also a member of the Blueshirts movement while in college. He was only just dissuaded by his classics professor at the last moment from embarking with the Irish Brigade under Eoin O&#x27;Duffy to fight for Franco in the Spanish Civil War.

However, while Lindsay declared himself as being &quot;an unrepentant&quot; Blueshirt, in his autobiography he denied that himself or many of the membership saw themselves as actual Fascists. Rather that they viewed themselves as a pseudo-paramilitary wing of Cumann na nGaedheal that was a response to the IRA of the 1930s acting as a pseudo-paramilitary wing of Fianna Fáil, and in fact, that they saw themselves as Democrats upholding free speech.

Lindsay subsequently became a teacher of classics at the Royal School, Cavan, and later at schools in Dublin. He studied law at University College Dublin and the King&#x27;s Inns, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1946. He married Moya Brady in 1952, and they had three children.

==Politics==
He was elected to Dáil Éireann on his sixth attempt, at the 1954 general election as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo North. He was re-elected at the 1957 general election, but lost his seat at the 1961 general election, after which he was elected to the 10th Seanad by the Industrial and Commercial Panel. He became Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.

Lindsay returned to the Dáil at the 1965 general election, but lost his seat at the 1969 general election, when he switched constituency to Dublin North-Central. He was again unsuccessful at the 1973 general election.

His ministerial career was brief, lasting only eight months. In July 1956, he was appointed by Taoiseach John A. Costello as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and to the Minister for Education in the Second Inter-Party Government. In October 1956, he was promoted to the cabinet as Minister for the Gaeltacht, serving until March 1957, when Fianna Fáil returned to power after the 1957 general election. On his return to the Dáil in 1965, he was appointed Fine Gael spokesman on transport and power.

==Law==
Lindsay had become a Senior Counsel in 1954, and following the loss of his parliamentary seat in 1969, he devoted himself full-time to his practice at the bar, becoming a leading figure in criminal law. In 1975, he was appointed to the position of Master of the High Court, from which he retired on his seventieth birthday in January 1984.

==Later life==
Lindsay served as chair of &quot;Cumann Céimithe na Gaillimhe&quot;, the University College Galway Graduate Association, during the 1980s. He published his memoirs in 1992. He died on 29 June 1993.

<doc id="1157444" wikidata="Q279579" url="?curid=1157444" title="Trondheim Fjord">
<text>The Trondheim Fjord or Trondheimsfjorden (), an inlet of the Norwegian Sea, is Norway&#x27;s third-longest fjord at long. It is located in the west-central part of the country in Trøndelag county, and it stretches from Ørland Municipality in the west to Steinkjer Municipality in the north, passing the city of Trondheim on its way. Its maximum depth is , in the channel between Orkland Municipality and Indre Fosen Municipality.

The largest islands in the fjord are Ytterøya and Tautra; the small island of Munkholmen is located near the harbor of Trondheim; and there are several islands at the entrance of the fjord. The narrow &quot;Skarnsundet&quot; is crossed by the Skarnsund Bridge. The part of the fjord to the north of the strait is referred to as the &quot;Beitstadfjorden&quot;. The main part of the Trondheimsfjord is ice-free all year; only Verrasundet, a long and narrow fjord branch in the northern part of the fjord, might be ice covered in winter. The Beitstadfjorden might also freeze over in winter, but only for a few weeks.

The towns of Stjørdalshalsen, Levanger, and Steinkjer are found on the eastern and northeastern shores of the fjord. Aker Verdal in Verdal Municipality produces large offshore installations for the petroleum sector. A yard in Indre Fosen Municipality completed the luxurious apartment ship &quot;MS The World&quot;. Fiborgtangen is a peninsula along the eastern shore of the fjord where a large paper mill owned by Norske Skog is located.

The Trondheimsfjord has rich marine life, with both southern and northern species; at least 90 species of fish have been observed, and the fjord has the largest biological production among Norway&#x27;s fjords. In recent years, deep water corals (&quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot;) were discovered in the fjord, not far from the city of Trondheim. Several of the best salmon rivers in Norway empty into the fjord. Among these are the rivers Gaula (on the border of Melhus Municipality and Trondheim Municipality), Orklaelva (in Orkland Municipality), Stjørdalselva (in Stjørdal Municipality), and Verdalselva (in Verdal Municipality).

The lowland east and south of the fjord represents one of Norway&#x27;s best agricultural areas. The more rugged and mountainous Fosen peninsula lies to the west and northwest, giving some shelter from the wind common to coastal areas.

The Trondheimsfjord was an important waterway in the Viking Age, as it is still today. In 1888, an undersea mudslide caused a tsunami that killed one person in Trondheim and ruptured three railway lines.

Four giant squid have been found in the fjord, which is among the highest concentrations in the world.

==Name==
The fjord is named after the city of Trondheim, but originally the name of the fjord might have been just &quot;*Þrónd&quot; or &quot;*Þróund&quot; in Old Norse. A name like that would be related to the verb &quot;þróast&quot;, which means to &#x27;thrive&#x27; or &#x27;flourish&#x27; and the name &quot;Þrór&quot;, which means &#x27;likeable&#x27; or &#x27;stoutish&#x27; (and was one of Odin&#x27;s nicknames).

If this is the case, then the people living around the fjord (the &quot;þrœndir&quot;; see Trøndelag) named themselves after the fjord. (Compare &quot;sygnir&quot;, which means &#x27;the people living around the fjord Sogn&#x27;.)

<doc id="1157448" wikidata="Q4811856" url="?curid=1157448" title="Accommodation reflex">
<text>The accommodation reflex (or accommodation-convergence reflex) is a reflex action of the eye, in response to focusing on a near object, then looking at a distant object (and vice versa), comprising coordinated changes in vergence, lens shape (accommodation) and pupil size. It is dependent on cranial nerve II (afferent limb of reflex), superior centers (interneuron) and cranial nerve III (efferent limb of reflex). The change in the shape of the lens is controlled by ciliary muscles inside the eye. Changes in contraction of the ciliary muscles alter the focal distance of the eye, causing nearer or farther images to come into focus on the retina; this process is known as accommodation. The reflex, controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, involves three responses: pupil constriction, lens accommodation, and convergence.

A near object (for example, a computer screen) subtends a large area in the visual field, i.e. the eyes receive light from wide angles. When moving focus from a distant to a near object, the eyes converge. The ciliary muscle constricts making the lens thicker, shortening its focal length. The pupil constricts in order to prevent strongly diverging light rays hitting the periphery of the cornea and the lens from entering the eye and creating a blurred image.

==Pathway==
Information from the light on each retina is taken to the occipital lobe via the optic nerve and optic radiation (after a synapse in the lateral geniculate body of the posterior thalamus), where it is interpreted as vision. The peristriate area 19 interprets accommodation, and sends signals via the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the 3rd cranial nerve to the ciliary muscle, the medial rectus muscle and (via parasympathetic fibres) the sphincter pupillae muscle.

==Pupil constriction and lens accommodation==

During the accommodation reflex, the pupil constricts to increase the depth of focus of the eye by blocking the light scattered by the periphery of the cornea. The lens then increases its curvature to become more biconvex, thus increasing refractive power. The ciliary muscles are responsible for the lens accommodation response.

==Convergence==
Convergence is the ability of the eye to simultaneously demonstrate inward rotation of both eyes toward each other. This is helpful in effort to make focus on near objects clearer. Three reactions occur simultaneously; the eyes adduct, the ciliary muscles contract, and the pupils become smaller. This action involves the contraction of the medial rectus muscles of the two eyes and relaxation of the lateral rectus muscles. The medial rectus attaches to the medial aspect of the eye and its contraction adducts the eye. The medial rectus is innervated by motor neurons in the oculomotor nucleus and nerve.

==Focus on near objects==
The refractive index of the eye&#x27;s cornea-lens system allows the eye to produce sharply focused images on the retina. The refractive power resides mainly in the cornea, but the finer changes in refractive power of the eye are achieved by the lens changing its shape.

As a distant object is brought closer to the eye, the image moves behind the retina, producing blurring at the retina. This blurring is minimized by squeezing the lens to a more spherical shape, which again moves the image back to the plane of the retina.

In order to fixate on a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts around the lens to decrease its diameter and increase its thickness. The suspensory zonules of Zinn relax and the radial tension around the lens is released. This causes the lens to form a more spherical shape achieving greater refractive power.

==Focus on distant objects==
When the eye focuses on distant objects, the lens holds itself in a flattened shape due to traction from the suspensory ligaments. Ligaments pull the edges of the elastic lens capsule towards the surrounding ciliary body and by opposing the internal pressure within the elastic lens, keep it relatively flattened.

When viewing a distant object, the ciliary muscle relaxes, the diameter of the lens increases and its thickness decreases. The tension along the suspensory ligaments is increased to flatten the lens and decrease the curvature and achieve a lower refractive power.

==Neural circuit==
Three regions make up the accommodation neural circuit, the afferent limb, the efferent limb and the ocular motor neurons that are between the afferent and efferent limb.
; The afferent limb of the circuit
: This limb contains the main structures; the retina that contains the retinal ganglion axons in the optic nerve, chiasm and tract, the lateral geniculate body, and the visual cortex.
; The efferent limb of the circuit
: This limb includes Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the oculomotor neurons. The main function of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus is to send axons in the oculomotor nerve to control the ciliary ganglion which in turn, sends its axons in the short ciliary nerve to control the iris and the ciliary muscle of the eye. The oculomotor neurons functions to send its axons in the oculomotor nerve, to control the medial rectus, and converge the two eyes.
; Ocular motor control neurons
: Neurons that are interposed between the afferent and efferent limbs of this circuit and include the visual association cortex, which determines the image is &quot;out-of-focus, and sends corrective signals via the internal capsule and crus cerebri to the supraoculomotor nuclei. It also includes the supraoculomotor nuclei (located immediately superior to the oculomotor nuclei) that generates motor control signals that initiate the accommodation response and sends these control signals bilaterally to the oculomotor complex.

<doc id="1157452" wikidata="Q1029740" url="?curid=1157452" title="Timothy J. Murphy">
<text>Timothy Joseph Murphy (17 July 1893 – 29 April 1949) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Local Government from 1948 to 1949. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork West constituency from 1923 to 1949.

==Early life==
Known as &#x27;TJ&#x27;, he was born in Clondrohid, County Cork, son of Timothy Murphy, carpenter, and Mary Murphy (née Shea). He moved to Dunmanway, County Cork around 1920, having been earlier educated at the Clondrohid and Macroom National Schools. In his teens he was influenced by the activities of the Irish Land and Labour Association as well as the politics of William O&#x27;Brien. During these years he became involved in a trade union and with the Labour Party.

He was involved in journalism for a period, and became a salesman for Singer sewing machines before moving to Dunmanway around 1919.

==Politician==
===Trade unionist===
By 1922, he became branch Secretary of the Dunmanway ITGWU. His was also involved in local politics and had a role in the election of fellow ITGWU activist in Dunmanway, Michael Bradley, to the Dáil in the 1922 general election.

He expanded the role of &#x27;labour clubs&#x27; and was involved in the formation of virtually every Labour Club between 1926 and the early 1930s.

===TD and councillor (1923–1949)===
Following Bradley&#x27;s death in 1922, he contested the selection convention for the 1923 general election. At the Labour Party selection convention two Timothy Murphy&#x27;s were nominated with the Dunmanway Murphy winning out by one vote over Timothy from Clonakilty.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1923 general election as a Labour Party TD for Cork West. He was re-elected for this constituency as a Labour Party TD at the next nine general elections, until his death, but remained on the opposition benches of the Dáil until 1948 when the Labour Party joined the First Inter-Party Government. The Taoiseach John A. Costello then appointed him as Minister for Local Government in February of that year. He took a running mate in 1943 and 1944 but failed to deliver a second seat.

In the Dáil he supported the Treaty, urged Fianna Fáil to reject their abstentionist policy and return to normal politics. He was, however, in favour of Labour being an independent party and opposed the party supporting Fianna Fáil in government.

He had also sat on the Cork County Council from 1925, representing the Dunmanway local electoral area (1925–42) and the Skibereen local electoral area from 1942 until his resignation from the council in July 1948. He served on a number of county council committees and as vice-chairman and Chairman of the council, and was also a member of the West Cork board of public assistance and public health. Murphy advocated for Christian Socialism and the co-operative movement.

====Michael O&#x27;Riordan controversy (1944) ====
Murphy has been described as having been involved in the controversy surrounding the Liam Mellow branch of the Labour Party and Michael O&#x27;Riordan. A report in &quot;The Irish Press&quot; suggested that the Administrative Council had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch. This was headed up by Murphy as vice-chair. They heard the complaint against O&#x27;Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. Following an investigation, the two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. O&#x27;Riordan would later accuse Murphy of &quot;red-baiting&quot;.

===Cabinet: Minister for Local Government (1948–1949)===
Local Authority Manager Philip Monahan told Cork Corporation in 1948 that an experiment to build houses by direct labour had been suggested by Murphy. To proceed with the direct labour experiment, the City Manager was in the process of appointing an assistant architect, a draughtsman, an assistant engineer and a foreman. Concurrently, Monahan had decided to build other houses by contract so that the corporation could then decide if one method was superior to the other. A deputation of the Cork Regional Branch of the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland appeared before the meeting to protest this direct labour policy, but the Corporation agreed to proceed with the project as outlined by the City Manager.

==Death==
Murphy died suddenly in 1949, while speaking at an Inter-Party public meeting at Pearse Square, Fermoy, fourteen months into his tenure as a cabinet minister. He was buried in Dunmanway Cemetery. The by-election for his seat in the Dáil was held on 15 June 1949, and won for the Labour Party by his son, William J. Murphy.

==Legacy==
An area of Murphy&#x27;s home town of Dunmanway today bears the name &quot;T.J. Murphy Place&quot;.

<text>Thomas Walsh (8 December 1901 – 14 July 1956) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Agriculture from 1951 to 1954. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency from 1948 to 1956. He also served as a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 1943 to 1944.

He was born in Gowran, County Kilkenny, one of two sons and one daughter of James Walsh, a farmer, and Catherine Walsh (née Byrne). After early education at Patrician Brothers College, Mountrath, and Rockwell College, Cashel, County Tipperary, he attended Mountbellew Agricultural College, County Galway, on scholarship. In 1921 he was among the first students enrolled in the newly opened Pallaskenry Agricultural College, Pallaskenry, County Limerick. Raids on the college by the Black and Tans aroused in him strong nationalist sentiments.

Walsh first stood for election at the 1943 general election for the Kilkenny constituency but was not successful. He was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann as a senator for the Agricultural Panel and served until 1944. He was again an unsuccessful candidate at the 1944 general election but was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1948 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency.

In 1951, he joined the cabinet of Éamon de Valera as Minister for Agriculture. Walsh died suddenly in 1956 in a road traffic accident, while still a member of the Dáil. The subsequent by-election was won by the Fianna Fáil candidate Martin Medlar.

<text>&quot;Juice Trains&quot; (or &quot;Orange Juice Trains&quot;) are the unit trains of Tropicana fresh orange juice operated by railroads in the United States.

==History==

Tropicana Products was founded in 1947 in Bradenton, Florida by Anthony T. Rossi, an Italian immigrant, growing from 50 employees to over 3,000 in 2003. Early distribution of fresh orange juice was by way of hand-delivered juice jars to nearby homes, but demand grew, especially in New York City. By 1957, the ship, S.S. &quot;Tropicana&quot;, was used and could hold up to of juice to New York for its weekly delivery. The ship&#x27;s last voyage was in 1961 when transportation shifted to truck and rail transport.

In 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via insulated boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Florida to Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around of juice. On June 7, 1971, the &quot;Great White Juice Train,&quot; the first unit train in the food industry, commenced service over the route. The unit train consisted of 150 insulated boxcars, fabricated in the Alexandria, Virginia shops of Fruit Growers Express. An additional 100 cars were incorporated into the fleet, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures consistent. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs during the first ten years of its operation.

==Route and operations==

Starting out on Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL) south of Tampa, Florida, the original used former Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) tracks. It crossed over to the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac (RF&amp;P) in Richmond, Virginia at pier 5 of the James River Bridge. At Potomac Yard, in Alexandria, Virginia, Penn Central Transportation (PC) took over and operated under the overhead wire with electric locomotives most of the way to Kearny, New Jersey. 

There have been more than a few changes over the years. Tropicana became the world&#x27;s leading producer of branded fruit juices. In 1976, Conrail (CR) took over from Penn Central, with electrification discontinued in 1981. SCL became part of CSX Corporation (CSX) in 1980 and merged into Seaboard System Railroad (SBD) and then CSX Transportation, which also included RF&amp;P by 1991. In 1997, a second Juice Train began serving Cincinnati, Ohio. When CSX acquired part of Conrail in 1999, an all-CSX train began traveling to a new larger facility in Jersey City, New Jersey on the National Docks Secondary.

Rolling stock also changed, including orange, white, and blue cars, some with innovative refrigeration. Designated &quot;TPIX&quot; they are custom-built to Tropicana&#x27;s specification. The Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) carries Tropicana cars from a second processing facility in Fort Pierce, Florida. A reliable and economically viable transport mode, the Juice Trains are also a powerful mode of advertising, running ten trips each week to Jersey City and Cincinnati. Additional shipments with specially-equipped refrigerated cars currently travel by rail to California. Tropicana had its own GE 70-ton switcher locomotive, No. 98, to switch cars at the New Jersey destination.

In 2017, CSX abolished separate Juice Trains between Philadelphia and Florida. Tropicana products are carried on other CSX trains to and from Florida. A separate train for Tropicana operates over the short distance north of Philadelphia.

<text>Smash TV is a 1990 arcade video game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams Electronics Games. It is a twin-stick shooter in the same vein as 1982&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which was also co-created by Jarvis. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear versions are titled Super Smash TV.

The plot centers on a dystopian television game show in the then-future year of 1999, where one or two contestants shoot attackers in order to survive while collecting money, prizes, and temporary power-ups. The show is taped in front of a live studio audience and broadcast via satellite worldwide. Once all of the challengers in each arena have been massacred, the contestant(s) proceeds to the next room. One room in each level contains a boss which ends the level when defeated.

==Gameplay==
The play mechanic is similar to that of Eugene Jarvis&#x27; earlier &quot;&quot;, with twin-joystick controls and series of single-screen arenas. While most of the enemies in &quot;Robotron&quot; are visible at the start of a level, in &quot;Smash TV&quot; they are generated in waves as a level progresses. Power-ups, some of which give the player a new weapon, are picked up by running over them.

The themes were borrowed from violent and dystopian sci-fi blockbuster films from 1987 such as &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;. The plot involves a wealthy celebrity named Master of Ceremonies (or MC for short) who is hosting and competing in his violent game show, in the not-too-distant future of 1999. MC has the playable contestant(s) moving from one high-tech gauntlet to the next, each player has to shoot hordes of enemies who enter via passages on each side of the screen while also collecting weapons, power-up items, and gift-wrapped prizes. The final room in each level is a protracted fight with a boss.

At the end of the game is a showdown with the show&#x27;s host where players are granted their life and freedom. Among the game&#x27;s items are keys. If enough are collected, players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome where players can &quot;collect&quot; hundreds of blue bikini-clad blonde and buxom &quot;babes&quot; akin to other prizes in the game.

The game features verbal interjections from the game show host such as &quot;Total carnage! I love it!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d buy that for a dollar!&quot;. The first of these became the title of the 1992 follow-up, &quot;Total Carnage&quot;. The second phrase is from a fictional TV show within &quot;RoboCop&quot;.

==Development==
Mark Turmell recounted: &quot;When Hasbro pulled the plug on an interactive movie project I was working on, I went to Williams to design coin-op games. I moved to Chicago, hired John Tobias, and together we did our first coin-op, &quot;Smash T.V.&quot;&quot;

The announcer in the game is voiced by sound designer Paul Heitsch. The script was created by the game&#x27;s composer and sound designer Jon Hey.

Originally the arcade game shipped without the Pleasure Dome bonus level implemented, although there was text mentioning it in the game. The design team had not been sure that players would actually get to the end of the game. However, players did finish the game and after arcade operators informed Williams of player complaints of being unable to finish it, the company sent out a new revision that included the Pleasure Dome level.

==Ports==
&quot;Smash TV&quot; was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Game Gear, Master System, and Genesis consoles. Ocean published ports for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga, all released in early 1992.

On some home systems such as the NES, players have the option to use the directional pad on the second controller to control the direction the character will shoot on-screen. Using this option for both players requires a multitap. The dual control aspect of the game works particularly well on the SNES, as its four main buttons, A, B, X and Y, are laid out like a D-pad, enabling the player to shoot in one direction while running in another.

==Reception==
The arcade game was generally well-received. The Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) gave it the &quot;most innovative game&quot; award in 1990.

The home conversions of &quot;Smash TV&quot; received positive to mixed reviews.

The Amiga version scored 895 out of a possible 1,000 in a UK magazine review, and the Spectrum magazine &quot;CRASH&quot; awarded the ZX version 97%, making it a Crash Smash.

===Accolades===
In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed &quot;Smash TV&quot; as the 6th best arcade game of all time. In 2004, &quot;Smash TV&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. In 1995, Total! rated &quot;Super Smash TV&quot; 51st on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot; list. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the game 84th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; list.

==Legacy==
The 1992 Williams arcade game &quot;Total Carnage&quot; shares many elements with &quot;Smash TV&quot; and was also programmed by Turmell, but is not a sequel.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Smash TV&quot; is part of &quot;Arcade Party Pak&quot; released for the PlayStation in 1999.

It is included in the &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; collection, which is available for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was released in 2003. These versions give the player the option to save high scores. &quot;Smash TV&quot; is also part of the 2012 compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;.

&quot;Smash TV&quot; was made available for download through Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 and was the first version of the game to officially allow two players to play the game online. It was delisted from the service in February 2010 after the dissolution of Midway Games.

<doc id="1157479" wikidata="Q11664557" url="?curid=1157479" title="USS Macedonian (1836)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;, was a three-masted, wooden-hulled sailing frigate of the US Navy, carrying 36 guns. Rebuilt from the keel of the first at Gosport (later Norfolk) Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia beginning in 1832, the new &quot;Macedonian&quot; was launched and placed in service in 1836, with Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones in command.

==Service history==

===West Indies Squadron===
&quot;Macedonian&quot; was assigned to the West Indies Squadron to cruise in the West Indies and along the west coast of Africa from 1839 to 1847 as a continuing deterrent to Caribbean pirates.

By a joint resolution of Congress on 3 March 1847 &quot;Macedonian&quot; and sloop-of-war were placed in civilian hands to carry food to Ireland during the Great Famine of the late 1840s. With a volunteer crew, &quot;Macedonian&quot;, Captain George C. De Kay in command, departed New York on 15 June with 12,000 barrels of provisions for Ireland donated by private citizens of the United States, returning to Brooklyn Navy Yard some months later to resume navy service.

===Expedition to Japan===
In 1852 &quot;Macedonian&quot; docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to be razeed and converted to a sloop-of-war for Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s expedition to Japan. Assigned as part of the East India Squadron 
under command of Captain Joel Abbot, was one of the ten American ships entering Edo Bay, Japan, on 13 February 1854 during Perry&#x27;s second visit to negotiate the opening of Japan to foreign trade, remaining as part of the show of force under the Convention of Kanagawa signed at Yokohama on 31 March 1854.

&quot;Macedonian&quot; remained on patrol in the North Pacific for the next three years. Then, from 1857 to 1861 she served with the Home Squadron in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. On 26 October 1858 she assisted with the refloating of , which had run aground on the Pelican Shoal, off Smyrna, Ottoman Empire.

===Civil war===

With the American Civil War looming just ahead, the frigate departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for Pensacola, Florida, on 12 January 1861 to join in preventing a possible Confederate attack on the harbor. On 11 February &quot;Macedonian&quot; sailed for Veracruz, Mexico, arriving on the 24th. She then began patrol operations along the gulf coast and the coast of South America, with stops at Aspinwall (later Colón, Panama) and Portobelo, Panama; Martinique; and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. On 3 December she got underway with from St. Thomas for the east coast, arriving Boston Navy Yard on 16 January 1862. &quot;Macedonian&quot; spent most of the next two years with the West Indies Squadron. In July 1863 she cruised along the coast of Portugal with sloop-of-war hunting Confederate States ship . It was around then that Alfred Thayer Mahan served aboard for a brief time.

From the end of that year through 1870, &quot;Macedonian&quot; served as school and practice ship for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, first at Newport, Rhode Island, then after the civil war at Annapolis, Maryland. In 1871 she was laid up in ordinary at the Norfolk Navy Yard, where she was sold to Wiggin and Robinson for merchant service.

===Post-navy===
There is no record of &quot;Macedonian&quot; having actually sailed as a merchant ship, and the next reference to the ship, in 1900, mentions her as having been converted into the Macedonia Hotel at City Island, Bronx. The hotel was sold in 1912 and renamed the City Island Casino, but burned down on 9 June 1922. The naval origin of the Macedonian Hotel was mentioned in a &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; item in 1983.

<doc id="1157482" wikidata="Q5694426" url="?curid=1157482" title="Heaton Norris">
<text>Heaton Norris is a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is one of the Four Heatons, along with neighbours Heaton Chapel, Heaton Mersey and Heaton Moor. Originally within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, part of Heaton Norris was annexed to the County Borough of Stockport in 1835; Heaton Chapel and Heaton Moor followed in 1894 and the remnant in 1913.

== History ==
Historically part of Lancashire, Heaton Norris was part of the Manchester barony of the Grelley family, but between 1162 and 1180 it belonged to William le Norreys.

In the early 13th century, Heaton Norris, a sub manor of Manchester, encompassed all of the Four Heatons. It was escheated (i.e. reverted) to the manor of Manchester in around 1280. In 1322, there were 32 dwellings suggesting a population of 150, the ten freeholders of the escheated manor had the right to graze on common pasture and to cut wood. There was no chapel of ease, unlike neighbouring St Ostwalds at Didsbury, and it did not get one until St Thomas&#x27; was built in 1758.

The township remained part of the parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire until 1835 when the southern portion of the parish was absorbed into Stockport. In 1866 Heaton Norris became a separate civil parish, in 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, it was divided again, with a portion becoming part of Stockport county borough in Cheshire, and the remaining part forming the Heaton Norris urban district in Lancashire. A further transferred in 1901, and the remainder, Heaton Moor and Heaton Chapel, was added to Stockport county borough on 9 November 1913. There was a plebiscite in the 1930s on whether the area wished to become part of Manchester again, but the vote was lost. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished and merged with Stockport. In 1931 the parish had a population of 13,410. Since 1974, it has formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester.
Weaving was first recorded in 1580 and by 1776 farms were being advertised as having cowsheds and large loom houses. In spite of the industrial developments nearby in Stockport and Manchester, most of Heaton Norris remained agricultural, though in 1836 there were 20 mills employing upwards of 5,000. The rural nature changed with the arrival of the railway station at Heaton Norris in 1840 and Heaton Chapel in 1852, when the area became largely residential in order to house workers in local mills. The majority of Heaton Norris is characterised by deck-access or high-rise estates (such as Lancashire Hill) and Victorian terraced housing.

Heaton Norris Rovers, now known as Stockport County Football Club, was formed in 1883, and used to play on a pitch behind the Nursery Inn on Green Lane. In 1902, they left the Green Lane ground and moved to Edgeley Park.

== Geography ==
Heaton Norris, Heaton Mersey, Heaton Moor and Heaton Chapel are on the north bank of the River Mersey and south of the Cringle Brook; it is sited to the west of Reddish and the River Tame.

The land slopes gently towards the north from a high point in the south above a steep descent to the Mersey. Most of the townships are between above sea level, and above the river. Heaton Norris is about south of St Ann&#x27;s Square, Manchester. 

The soil is clay on marl and red sandstone.

==Transport==
The former Manchester to Buxton Roman road, now the A6, passes through Heaton Norris. The M60 motorway passes to the south of the suburb; junction 1 serves Heaton Norris.

A spur of the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Manchester Piccadilly passes through the suburb, over the large brick-built Stockport Viaduct. Heaton Norris railway station was a stop on the line, before it was closed in 1959.

The Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway, operated by Cheshire Lines Committee, ran parallel the north bank of the river. This provided passenger services between Manchester, Liverpool, and until January 1967; freight services continued until 1983 when the line was closed.

The Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal terminated at Heaton Norris.

== Industry ==
In 1820, William Nelstrop established his flour mill on Lancashire Hill. Nelstrops Albion Flour Mills were rebuilt on the same site in 1893 following a fire. The company is now one of Britain&#x27;s largest independent flour millers.

== Community facilities ==
Notable landmarks in Heaton Norris include:
* Bryant&#x27;s Warehouse
* A large B&amp;Q superstore which, when first opened, was the largest in the country
* Bowerfold Open Space, known locally as &quot;The Bonks&quot;, popular with locals for dog walking, horse riding, its football pitch, and, after heavy snowfalls, sledging. 
* All Saints&#x27; Church, designed by Preston and Vaughan and consecrated in 1888, is on the corner of Manchester Road and All Saints Road; it runs a number of community projects, such as the award winning free music school for children, &quot;Heaton&#x27;s Hotpots&quot; free meals and various groups for children, young people and families. The church also has an active brass band and choir.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1990s BBC television series &quot;The Mrs Merton Show,&quot; and its spin-off sitcom, &quot;Mrs Merton and Malcolm&quot; (1999), the title character, Mrs Merton, played by Greater Manchester native Caroline Aherne, often refers to living in Heaton Norris. The latter series was set in the area.

Another BBC comedy series, &quot;Early Doors&quot;, principally written by and starring Aherne&#x27;s collaborator Craig Cash (also a former Heaton Norris resident), revolved around a failing pub, which by inference and local references was also in Heaton Norris. The pub was set in The Grapes, Stockport, and based on the Three Crowns in Heaton Norris.

Some of the scenes for the BBC One comedy drama &quot;Sunshine&quot;, starring Steve Coogan, Bernard Hill, Craig Cash and Phil Mealey, were filmed in the Nursery Inn, a local pub. Part of an advert for Paddy Power starring Rhodri Giggs was also filmed in Heaton Norris Park.

<text>Linda Zarda Cook (born June 4, 1958) is an American businesswoman, who is CEO of Harbour Energy since 2014. She was previously CEO of Shell Gas &amp; Power, part of Royal Dutch Shell, in the Netherlands until 2009. Cook was named the 44th most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in September 2007.

==Biography==
Cook was raised in Shawnee, Kansas. She graduated from the University of Kansas in petroleum engineering in 1980.

She began her Shell career in 1980 as a reservoir engineer in the United States, advancing through the company to accept greater responsibilities in exploration and production with Shell U.S.A. Her first European assignment came in 1998, when she and her family moved to the Netherlands, where she led Shell International EP. She was CEO of the Gas &amp; Power division from 2000 to 2003, then led Shell Canada for a year before returning to her previous post.

On May 26, 2009, Shell announced that Cook mutually agreed to step down after losing the race to become the company&#x27;s next chief executive. Shortly following the announcement of her resignation was the news that her division, Gas and Power, would be absorbed into the new management structure being promoted by new chief executive Peter Voser. Shares in Shell fell 1.1 per cent or 18p to 1613p in morning trading. Cook had worked for Shell for 29 years. She lost out on a loyalty bonus of more than £800,000, but her severance pay came to about £5million, a figure determined by standard company and legal guidelines.

Cook joined the board of directors of The Boeing Company in 2003. She held four board assignments over the course of her tenure, including chair of the finance committee. On February 10, 2015, it was announced that Cook would not seek reelection to the board, ending her term that April. Cook has also been on the boards of directors of KBR and Marathon Oil.

Cook has been CEO of Harbour Energy since it was established in July 2014. In March 2021, the company merged and absorbed Chrysaor Holdings and Premier Oil to become the largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea.

<doc id="1157484" wikidata="Q1934020" url="?curid=1157484" title="Nikos Kavvadias">
<text>Nikos Kavvadias (; ; 11 January 1910 – 10 February 1975) was a Greek poet, writer and a sailor by profession. He used his travels around the world, the life at sea and its adventures, as powerful metaphors for the escape of ordinary people, outside the boundaries of reality. His poems are widely regarded as belonging to symbolism, and he has been characterized by some as a poète maudit.

== Early life and education ==

Kavvadias was born in Nikolsk-Ussuriysky (now Ussuriysk in the Primorsky Krai region of Russia), where his father was a merchant. He believed that this had established a permanent connection between him and the Far East as he wrote in one of his short stories titled &quot;Li&quot;. His parents were Greek, originating from the island of Kefalonia and as a young child he had the opportunity to travel extensively. His family returned to their island of origin for a few years before finally moving to Piraeus in 1921. He wrote his first poems while in school.

In 1928, after having graduated from high school he sat an entrance exam for medical school but as his father fell sick the same year, young Kavvadias was forced to get a job as an office clerk in a shipping company to help his family. He lasted only a few months and after his father&#x27;s death, he went on board the freighter ship &quot;Agios Nikolaos&quot; (Saint Nicholas) as a sailor. For the following years he worked on freighter boats, returning home wretched and penniless. At that point he aspired to train as a captain but settled for a diploma as a radio officer instead, which he got in 1939. By that time however, World War II had started and he was sent to fight in Albania.

During the German occupation of Greece, he joined the National Liberation Front (EAM) and became a member of the Communist Party. When the war ended in 1944, he embarked again and traveled continuously, this time as a radio officer, until November 1974. These experiences at sea and the exotic ports he visited became the material for his poetry. Returning from his last trip and as he was preparing the publication of his third collection of poems, he died suddenly from a stroke on 10 February 1975 after only three months off sea.

Since his death, his poetry has been popularized in Greece, partly because of Thanos Mikroutsikos who released an album with Kavvadias&#x27;s poetry set to his music in his very popular albums &quot;Σταυρός του Νότου&quot; (Southern Cross) [1979] and &quot;Γραμμές των Οριζόντων&quot; (Horizons&#x27; Lines) [1991].

== Early writings ==

His first collection of poems, &quot;Marabou&quot; was published in 1933 when Kavvadias was in his early twenties and carries the spirit of a romantic young man, impressed with the marvels of the world. Most of the poems tell half-fictitious stories transpiring at sea and at the different ports Kavvadias visited during his journeys. The collection begins with a poem written in the first person about the writer&#x27;s tragic love for a young wealthy girl he met on board and who later ended as a poor prostitute that he could barely recognise. Other poems recount the stories of a washed out Norwegian captain who died homesick watching a ship sailing to the Lofoten and of an enchanted dagger carrying the curse that its owner shall kill someone they love. Artistically, he was influenced by French literature and the poet Charles Baudelaire whom he cites in many of his works. Like a lot of Greek poetry, Kavvadias&#x27;s work is characterized by a deep feeling of nostalgia.

== Later works ==

His other collections are titled &quot;Fog&quot;, published in 1947 and &quot;Traverso&quot; published after his death in 1975. His second short story titled &quot;Of War&quot;, which was to be his last and was also published after his death in 1987, recounts the story of his rescue by a local during a storm. His experiences during World War II affected him profoundly and as a result, his later works became increasingly political and in support of both the communists in Greece and the general leftist movements throughout the world. One of these poems is about the death of Argentinian revolutionary Ernesto (Che) Guevara, written as an answer to the criticisms received by some of his more polemic comrades who thought that his poems over-romanticized the harsh and dangerous life of sailors who were potential symbols of class struggle.

Another is about the execution of Andalusian poet and playwright Federico García Lorca by the Francoists which, in the poem, is compared with the destruction of the Greek village of Distomo and the executions at Kaisariani which were carried out by the Nazi forces that occupied Greece.

His only novel &quot;The Shift&quot; was published in 1954 and recounts the stories told by the sailors on their night shift at the ship&#x27;s bridge. Images from exotic places, prostitutes, captains gone mad and memories of the war blend together, to form a dreamy world of lucid forms, part fictional, part true.
He is popular among Greeks and his best poems are taught at schools. He is considered by many to embody much of the &quot;Greek soul&quot; because of his romantic affiliation with the sea and its journeys and for his genuinely humane outlook.

A selection of his poetry, with some of his shorter prose, translated into English by Simon Darragh, is available under the title &quot;Wireless Operator&quot; from the London Publisher Enitharmon.

== Poems set to music ==
Since 1967, many of Kavvadias&#x27; poems have been incorporated in the music of other Greek artists. Though, in most cases it was one or two of his poems that were set to music and released alongside other artists&#x27; songs, there were some major exceptions that involved multiple of Kavvadias&#x27; poems. Panos Savvopoulos was the first artist to set Kavadias&#x27; poems to music when he released his disk &quot;Episode&quot; in 1971. His poem &quot;Mal du départ&quot; was set to music by Giannis Spanos and released in 1975. Thanos Mikroutsikos released his &quot;The Southern Cross&quot; album in 1979 where he set 11 of Kavvadias&#x27; poems to music, featuring other prominent Greek artists, such as Vasilis Papakonstantinou. The album was negatively received in the beginning. In 1986, record company Minos released the record &quot;Nikos Kavvadias, S/S Ionion&quot; set to music performed by Ilias Ariotis and Noti Chasapi. Thanos Mikroutsikos made a great comeback to the subject in 1991, when he released his record &quot;Lines of the Horizons&quot; which included a whopping 17 of Kavvadias&#x27; poems set to song. Though many of the songs were the same as in the 1979 album - only reperformed - the record was very well received.

Some of the poems that have been set to music since 1967 are:

*1979: Woman (Γυναίκα)
* 1979: Esmeralda (Εσμεράλδα)
* 1979: Cambay&#x27;s water

Gabor&#x27;s last wish is to be with Leila in the garden until darkness.

=== Act II ===
Gül Baba finds that Gabor is a very good student and wants to save his life. He intervenes on Gabor&#x27;s behalf with the pasha. The pasha agrees, but only if Leila will be his wife. Leila accepts this because she wants to save Gabor, but Gabor attacks the pasha with a knife. Now everything seems lost! Gül Baba destroys his rose garden and says to the pasha that it was done by Allah, who is angry because of the strict sentence.

=== Act III ===
The pasha Ali is afraid of Allah and gives a pardon to Gabor. Gül Baba regrets his destruction of the garden. However, Leila promises him that young couples will go for hundreds of years to his tomb to give him a rose.

<text>Bugchasing (alternatively bug chasing) is the rare practice of intentionally seeking human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection through sexual activity. 

Bugchasers—those who eroticize HIV—are a subculture of barebackers, men who have unprotected sex with other men. It is statistically rare for men to self-identify as bugchasers, and many of those who do never participate in sexual acts that can lead to HIV infection. There are some explanations for the behavior and fantasies of bugchasing, ranging from sexual excitement at the idea of HIV-positive status, to finding a shared sense of community with other HIV-positive people, to suicidality.

By 2003, the concept had entered the public consciousness after &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published &quot;Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+&quot;, an article—since widely disputed for its statistical methods—describing the practice. It may have existed since the AIDS crisis began. It has since been mentioned in or the focus of pieces of media and popular culture. , bugchasing behavior still persists as a niche behavior, in spite of the widespread availability of effective PrEP and HAART treatments that protect against HIV transmission.

== Origins ==
The precise origins of bugchasing—the pursuit of HIV infection—are largely unknown, with its inception located either at the beginning of the AIDS crisis or closer to the 1990s. But it existed by at least 1997, when &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an article about the subject, followed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, &quot;Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+&quot;, written by Gregory Freeman, was the first to bring widespread concern and attention to the practice. That article claimed that around 25 percent of all new HIV infections in the United States (10,000 of 45,000) were linked to bugchasing activity.
Freeman&#x27;s statistics erroneously counted all men who engaged in barebacking, regardless of motivation or attempts to seek out HIV infection, as bugchasers. Authorities that Freeman cited have since claimed he fabricated their statements, and his data have been widely criticized. In the estimation of sexuality studies scholar Octavio R. Gonzalez, Freeman&#x27;s article was perhaps most responsible for bringing the term &quot;bugchasing&quot; to a mainstream audience, and public interest in and understanding of the practice increased following Freeman&#x27;s article.

== Motivation and activity ==
Bugchasers are men who have sex with men (MSM) who eroticize HIV infection, particularly through engaging in online sexual fantasies of being infected with HIV, or who actually pursue infection with the virus. Since little is understood about the practice in general, the motivations for developing bugchasing identity and behavior remain largely undefined. However, at least four motivations have been suggested.
First, some men may become bugchasers as a result of fear of HIV infection, which had previously altered their sexual behavior, such as men abstaining from sex entirely, committing to one partner, or using preventative measures such as condoms. In this way, bugchasers may view their actions as empowering, both sexually and personally; the transformation of bugchasers from HIV-negative to HIV-positive status is understood by the group as masculinizing, which grants them additional status. Second, some men view HIV-positive status as erotic or sexually stimulating. It may be a subject of pleasure or the ultimate taboo to overcome.
Third, bugchasers may understand HIV-positive status (or its pursuit) as granting a shared identity and sense of community.
And fourth, bugchasing has been described as a political device and action against social norms (such as those tied to heteronormativity) through transgression of—or rebellion against—popular sentiments about gay life. There is a fifth possible motivation—suicide—but this remains an unclear or imprecise explanation for bugchasing behavior.

Bugchasing is a rare sexual taboo. Many self-identified bugchasers do not deliberately seek out sex with HIV-positive people. Many men who self-identify as bugchasers never attempt to become HIV-positive. 

The widespread availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), capable of preventing HIV infection in otherwise unprotected sexual encounters, has not resulted in the disappearance of bugchasing. Some men incorporate taking PrEP alongside bugchasing behavior, others experiment with bugchasing while on PrEP, and others view it as emasculating and refuse to use it.

== Group dynamics ==
While barebacking and bugchasing are both centered in risky sexual activity, they are distinct activities. Bugchasing is a subculture of barebacking, and intent is a distinguishing characteristic between bugchasers and barebackers: most barebackers do not intend to be infected (or infect others) with HIV, which is the apparent focus of bugchasing behavior.

In the view of ethnologist Jamie García-Iglesias and researcher Tim Dean, bugchasers circulate several metaphors that distinguish their identity from other MSM communities: insemination, pregnancy, and paternity. According to Dean and the psychological researcher Hugh Klein, since HIV is able to spread and reproduce through the sexual activity belonging to bugchasing, its cultural dimensions—institutions, norms, practices, and forms of kinship that, taken together, form a community situated around HIV status—may be transmitted through viral infection, similar to cultural propagation through birth and paternity.
Similarly, bugchasing spaces may reinforce certain notions of masculinity. The sex researcher Ellie Reynolds writes that HIV-positive men who purposely seek out others to infect with HIV—known as giftgivers—are constructed as hypermasculine through a penetrative sexual role, while bugchasers are understood to lack masculinity: penetrated (rather than penetrating), having their rectums described with words relating to women such as &quot;pussy&quot; and &quot;mancunt&quot;, they occupy a feminine role in the social order. Whether giftgivers continue to exist is uncertain, given what García-Iglesias calls their &quot;statistically rare&quot; population and &quot;biological implausib[ility] (on the basis of widespread successful treatment)&quot;.

== Media and culture ==
American filmmaker Louise Hogarth released a documentary, &quot;The Gift&quot;, in the same year the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; piece was published. It focused on narratives of bugchasers, emphasizing the self-reported positive aspects of HIV infection. Three years later, Ricky Dyer, an HIV-positive man, released a documentary through BBC3 entitled &quot;I love being HIV+&quot;, suggesting that most bugchasing activity is simply fantasy. In 2009, gay playwright Erik Patterson ran the tragicomedy &quot;He Asked For It&quot;, dealing with bugchasing and HIV-positive status in contemporary Hollywood. Bugchasing was also a part of the show &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;.

In 2012, Canadian Steven Boone was tried and convicted of three counts each of attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault after having unprotected sex with four men after previously contracting HIV. A self-described &quot;poz vampire&quot;—the word &quot;poz&quot; referring to acquiring HIV—he was immersed in bugchasing culture. His convictions on attempted murder have since been quashed after appealing to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, while the aggravated sexual assault convictions remain. The appeals court said it was not proven in the original case that he intended to kill his sexual partners; it offered the government the possibility of a new trial.

<doc id="1157501" wikidata="Q733492" url="?curid=1157501" title="Leningrad Codex">
<text>The Leningrad Codex ( [Leningrad Book]; ) is the oldest known complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew, using the Masoretic Text and Tiberian vocalization. According to its colophon, it was made in Cairo in AD 1008 (or possibly 1009). 

Some have proposed that the Leningrad Codex was corrected against the Aleppo Codex, a slightly earlier manuscript that was partially lost in the 20th century. However, Paul E. Kahle argues that the Leningrad manuscript was more likely based on other, lost manuscripts by the ben Asher family. The Aleppo Codex is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since the 1947 anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.

In modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in (1937), (1977), and (2004–present). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.

==Name==
The Leningrad Codex (a codex is a handwritten book bound at one side, as opposed to a scroll) is so named because it has been housed at the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg since 1863 (before 1917 named Imperial Public Library). In 1924, after the Russian Revolution, Petrograd (formerly SaintPetersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the since 1937, it became internationally known as the &quot;Leningrad Codex&quot;. Although the city&#x27;s name was restored to the original StPetersburg after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the National Library of Russia requested that &quot;Leningrad&quot; be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the &quot;Codex Petropolitanus&quot;, &quot;Petrograd Codex&quot;, &quot;Codex Petersburgensis&quot;, or &quot;St. Petersburg Codex&quot;. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (AD 916), but contains only the later Prophets.

==Contents==
The biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian vowels and cantillation signs. In addition, there are masoretic notes in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather.

The Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The carpet page shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle.

The order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of Sephardic biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the Ketuvim. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below.

==History==

According to its colophon, the codex was copied in Cairo from manuscripts written by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher. It has been claimed to be a product of the ben Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that ben Asher ever saw it. Unusually for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and cantillation) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher&#x27;s tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not perfect, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in hundreds of places. There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by Moshe Goshen-Gottstein that an existing text not following ben Asher&#x27;s rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules.

The codex is now preserved in the National Library of Russia, accessioned as &quot;Firkovich B 19 A&quot;. Its former owner, the Crimean Karaite collector Abraham Firkovich, left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in StPetersburg.

==Modern editions==
===&quot;Biblia Hebraica&quot;===
In 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while Paul E. Kahle supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of &quot;Biblia Hebraica&quot; (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot; (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for &quot;Biblia Hebraica Quinta&quot; (BHQ).

As an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until Biblia Hebraica.

The Westminster Leningrad Codex is a digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the University of Michigan in 1981–1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan, with further proofreading and corrections. The version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax.

===Jewish editions===

The Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh):
*The Dotan edition (which was distributed to soldiers in mass quantities as the official Tanakh of the Israel Defense Forces throughout the 1990s).
*The &quot;JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh&quot; (Philadelphia, 1999) and the various volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary and JPS Bible Commentary use the Westminster text described above.
*Etz Hayim, the Torah and commentary of the Conservative Movement.

(Contrary to popular belief as previously stated on this page, the Koren editions of Tanakh are not based primarily on the Leningrad Codex, but on the second edition Mikraot Gedolot published by Daniel Bomberg in Venice in 1525, with changes made to the text based on a variety of older manuscripts which are not named by the publisher. It is possible, as some have claimed, that the Leningrad Codex was among those used, but it is not specifically named by the publisher.)

For minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.

<doc id="1157503" wikidata="Q5387350" url="?curid=1157503" title="Eric Reiss">
<text>Eric Reiss (born 1954) is an American business and information architecture theorist, consultant and author, known for his work in the field of information architecture, usability, and service design. In 2010, he was named in a blog as &quot;One of the Top 10 European Content Strategists to Watch&quot;. In 2019 he sued the Information Architecture Institute following being asked to step down due to multiple accusations of sexual harassment.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Born in San Antonio, Texas in 1954, his family relocated to St. Louis prior to his first birthday when his father accepted a position at Washington University School of Medicine. Reiss is the son of two prominent physicians who played pivotal roles in bringing about the nuclear test-ban treaty of 1963 (see Linus Pauling &quot;Activism&quot;). His Viennese-born father, Eric Reiss, M.D., performed early and groundbreaking research on parathyroid hormone (PTH). His mother, Louise Zibold Reiss, M.D., as Director of the Baby Tooth Survey, was involved in mapping levels of radioactive Strontium-90 in the U.S. food chain secondary to nuclear fallout. His family moved to the Chicago suburb of Highland Park in 1964. He was active in theatre and the performing arts while at Highland Park High School from 1968–1972. During this time, Reiss started restoring player pianos and jukeboxes. He formed his first company, Reiss Player Piano Service, at age 16.

Reiss returned to St. Louis to study at Washington University in St. Louis in 1972. A ragtime pianist, Reiss was Musical Director on the Goldenrod Showboat on the Mississippi River levee during much of 1975, where he also participated in the National Ragtime Festival along with Trebor Tichenor, Dave Jason, Terry Waldo, and the Black Eagle Jazz Band. In 1976, he received his BA degree, having studied Performing Arts and Political Science.

=== Career in Scandinavian theater world ===
After his graduation, Eric Reiss moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to become a stage director at the Royal Danish Theatre. He was originally apprenticed in the fall of 1976 to Danish director Sam Besekow, where he assisted with the production of Eduardo De Filippo&#x27;s play &quot;Saturday, Sunday, Monday&quot;. In early 1977, Reiss was granted full director status by the theater. In 1977, his original play, &quot;Marionettes&quot;, was awarded first prize at the Illinois One-Act Play Festival.

Following a 10-year career in the Scandinavian theater world, publication of the first Danish-language adventure game (Skabet), and a short stint studying Egyptology, Reiss&#x27; first book, &quot;The Compleat Talking Machine&quot; () led to a career change in 1986 when he migrated from theater to professional writing.
=== Career in business-to-business communications ===
Reiss wrote the talking machine book, now in its fifth edition (10th printing). Reiss has since worked almost exclusively in developing business-to-business communications materials and marketing strategies.

With the advent of PC-based multimedia in the late 80s and the World Wide Web a few years later, Reiss combined his knowledge of theater, communication, and computers to build interactive business tools. In early 1997, he developed an on-line communications concept for his employer, Cross-Border Communications. The resulting microsite, &quot;Rick&#x27;s Café&quot;, was an interactive precursor to a blog and was subsequently voted Macromedia Site of the Week.

Reiss is currently CEO of the Copenhagen-based FatDUX Group ApS, which designs on-line and offline interactive experiences. He is a past president of the Information Architecture Institute, served as Chair of the European Information Architecture Summit - EuroIA from 2005-2014, and is on the Advisory Board of the Copenhagen Business School (Department of Informatics) and the Romanian Institute of Information Architecture. Between 2009-2011, Reiss was an Associate Professor of Usability and Design at IE Business School (formerly Instituto de Empresa) in Madrid, Spain, where he received several awards for his teaching, including the &quot;Best Professor&quot; prize in 2009.

== Personal life ==
Reiss is still active as a performer and musician, working regularly with Vivienne McKee&#x27;s London Toast Theatre in Copenhagen. He was also a regular on the MTV-produced candid-camera show, Rent Fup, during the season 1998–1999. Other acting credits include the Danish film, &quot;Miraklet i Valby&quot; (1989) and off-screen dubbing for Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000).

Reiss and his wife Dorthe make their home in Copenhagen, Denmark. He holds citizenship from Denmark, Germany, and the United States. 

== Work ==

Reiss is the author of &quot;Practical Information Architecture&quot; (), &quot;Web Dogma &#x27;06&quot;. and &quot;Usable Usability&quot; (). He has also contributed to several other books and publications, including &quot;Designing Web Navigation&quot; (), &quot;Pervasive Information Architecture&quot; (), &quot;Designing the Conversation&quot; (), &quot;Speaker Camp&quot; () and commentary to the online Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction. 

Reiss was President of the Information Architecture Institute for two terms and was a founder of the European Information Architecture Summit and served as Chair from 2005-2014 until he was asked to step down after multiple accusations of sexual harassment. Reiss once publicly responded to certain complaints by stating on Twitter, “Would you believe that someone actually accused me of violating a code of conduct? Sexual harassment — because I said ‘tits.’” On March 20, 2019 Reiss filed a petition for discovery against the Information Architecture Institute. Judge Patricia O‘Brian Sheahan dismissed the motion. On June 6, 2019 Reiss filed a general chancery claim in the Circuit Court of Cook County. The Information Architecture Institute as well as previous Information Architecture conference co-chairs, Colleen Chaflant, Nataniel Davis, Amy Jimenez Marquez, Stuart Maxwell, Bibiana Nunes, and Adam Polansky were issued summons to appear on July 1, 2019. He continued to speak at conferences after this, including events such as World Usability Congress 2023.

In 2024, the User Experience Professionals Association International (UXPA-I) awarded Reiss a Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was rescinded 11 hours after the announcement, and resulted in a public letter of condemnation as well as a lawsuit against the organization (Cause 236-358943-24, &quot;Chelsey Glasson v. User Experience Professionals Association&quot;, Tarrant County District Court).

<doc id="1157507" wikidata="Q4793947" url="?curid=1157507" title="Armstrong High School (Virginia)">
<text>Armstrong High School, part of the Richmond Public Schools, is a high school located in Richmond, Virginia, United States, with grades 9–12. The school was founded in 1867 as the Richmond Normal and High School by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and was eventually incorporated into the Richmond school system in 1876. The school&#x27;s namesake is former Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, a white commander of a U.S. Colored Troops (USCT) regiment during the American Civil War. General Armstrong later founded Hampton Institute, a historically black college now known as Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Armstrong was a mentor of Booker T. Washington.

==History==
The Richmond Normal and High School was conceived by Ralza M. Manly and opened in October 1867. It initially drew funding from a variety of sources, including the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, American Freedmen&#x27;s Union Commission, and local African-Americans. The Richmond Educational Association took over the school&#x27;s operation when the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau ceased operations in the state in 1870. By the following year it had been renamed Richmond Colored Normal School and moved buildings. The city of Richmond took over the school in 1876. Around the 1880s the school was renamed the Richmond Colored High and Normal School and in 1909 it adopted its current name of Armstrong High School.

In 1883, the high school held its first integrated graduation after black seniors protested at having a separate graduation ceremony from white students at other Richmond schools. The students succeeded in moving their graduation from the church where it was planned to the school&#x27;s auditorium, although seating was still segregated by race. Students Wendell Dabney and Maggie L. Walker were part of the graduating class, and Dabney later claimed that this was &quot;the first school strike of Negroes in America.&quot;

The location of Armstrong High school has changed three times since 1909. Once in 1923, then in 1951, and then again in 2004. It is now in its fourth location.

In 1909, the school was established at Leigh Streets at first and named in honor of Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, founder of Hampton University. The school then moved to a larger facility in 1923 at the corner of Prentis and Leigh Streets (now the Adult Career Development Center), and then to a new location, 1611 North 31st Street, in 1951.

In 2004, Armstrong High School merged with the nearby John F. Kennedy High School, continuing to use the Armstrong name, colors and mascot, except that it was now much newer and revamped with its air conditioned Kennedy building.

At the current location, Armstrong High School is one of only two of Richmond&#x27;s public schools which are physically located slightly outside the corporate limits of the independent city in the East End. The Kennedy High School complex and Fairfield Court Elementary School were built in the 1960s on land in a small portion of Henrico County adjacent to Interstate 64 which was cut off from the rest of the county when the Interstate highway was built.

The school&#x27;s public address announcer and former faculty member, Rodney Robinson, was named the 2019 National Teacher of the Year.

==Neighborhoods served==
The community served five public housing facilities in proximity to one another; one, Fairfield Court, is on the other side of the street from the high school.

==Operations==
Circa 2015 the school used metal detectors and had six security guards. April Hawkins, the principal, stated her belief that the school should have more guards.

==Demographics==
Circa 2015 there were 974 students and approximately 97% were African American.

==Student performance==
Circa 2015, of the entire student body, the number with plans to attend a four-year college or university was fewer than thirty.

<doc id="1157508" wikidata="Q5461269" url="?curid=1157508" title="Johnson University Florida">
<text>Johnson University Florida was a private Christian university in Kissimmee, Florida. It was part of the Johnson University system with its main campus outside Knoxville, Tennessee, and an online campus. It was affiliated with the Independent Christian Church of the Restoration Movement. The campus was closed in 2024.

==History==
Johnson University Florida was founded in 1975 as Central Florida Bible College. Following a move to its current main campus in 1986, the name changed to Florida Christian College. 

In its last decade operating as Florida Christian College (FCC), the campus faced increasing financial challenges. Those challenges were greatly exacerbated by the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. On December 10, 2012, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked Florida Christian College&#x27;s regional accreditation, effectively terminating the college&#x27;s ability to function independently. Although the college appealed the committee&#x27;s decision, SACS denied the appeal in February 2013. Under the administrative guidance of Johnson University, the college sought an injunction against SACS in order to restore its regional accreditation and proceed with a planned merger between the two schools. On March 8, 2013, the U.S. District Court of Northern Georgia granted the injunction restoring probationary status of FCC as a member of SACS. 

=== Acquisition by Johnson University ===
Johnson University purchased the Florida campus, simultaneously permitting financial oversight of the college and erasing its debt. Next, FCC President Bill Behrman stepped down and David L. Eubanks, former president of Johnson University, became the chief operating officer. Lastly, the trustees of Johnson University voted to incorporate the Florida property into its system, and the campus officially became Johnson University Florida on July 1, 2013.

===Closure===
On July 7, 2023, Johnson University announced that its Florida campus would be closing on June 30, 2024. The university cited a failure to increase enrollment after the creation of a &quot;turnaround plan&quot; in 2021 that attempted to revitalize enrollment, retention, and income. The university offered students the opportunity to transfer to the Tennessee campus, complete their degree online, or transfer to nearby universities in Florida. In April 2024, Osceola County announced that it would buy the university&#x27;s campus.

== Academics ==
The curriculum offered courses in a variety of majors. All students were required to take a core of Bible and theology classes along with their chosen major. The college offered multiple undergraduate programs, including certificates, Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science programs, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs, and a Master of Strategic Ministry program.

Johnson University Florida had been nationally accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education since 1985 and was regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools from 1995 to 2012. After losing its accreditation with SACS, it was acquired by Johnson University and was once again regionally accredited. It was a member of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Florida Association of Colleges and Universities.

The university was organized into seven schools:
* School of Arts &amp; Sciences
* School of Bible &amp; Theology
* School of Business &amp; Public Leadership
* School of Christian Ministries
* School of Communication &amp; Creative Arts
* School of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences
* Templar School of Education

==Athletics==
The athletic teams of the Johnson–Florida (JUFL) campus were called the Suns. The campus was a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the South Region of the Division II level.

JUFL competed in five intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer and volleyball.

The men&#x27;s baseball team earned second place in the 2012 NCCAA D-II National Championship and third place in the 2013 National Championship.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2012 and 2020 NCCAA D-II South Regional Championship.

==Notable people==
*Terry Bradds – jazz guitarist (advanced guitar instructor)
*David L. Eubanks – former president of Johnson University and chief operating officer of Johnson University Florida from 2013 to 2015
*Andrew Peterson – Christian author and recording artist (Class of 1997)
*James E. Smith – Bible scholar (professor emeritus)

<doc id="1157515" wikidata="Q659080" url="?curid=1157515" title="University of Bern">
<text>The University of Bern (, , ) is a public research university in the Swiss capital of Bern. It was founded in 1834. It is regulated and financed by the canton of Bern. It is a comprehensive university offering a broad choice of courses and programs in eight faculties and some 150 institutes. With around 19,000 students, the University of Bern is the third largest university in Switzerland.

== Organization ==
The University of Bern operates at three levels: university, faculties and institutes. Other organizational units include interfaculty and general university units. The university&#x27;s highest governing body is the Senate, which is responsible for issuing statutes, rules and regulations. Directly answerable to the Senate is the University Board of Directors, the governing body for university management and coordination. The board comprises the rector, the vice-rectors and the administrative director. The structures and functions of the University Board of Directors and the other organizational units are regulated by the Universities Act.

The University of Bern had 19,608 students in 2024. Of these, 41 percent (8,071) were registered in bachelor programs and 25 percent (4,992) in master&#x27;s programs, 18 percent (3,518) were doctoral students, and another 15 percent (3,027) were enrolled in continuing education programs. There were 1,667 bachelor&#x27;s degree graduation, 1,603 master&#x27;s degree graduations and 725 PhD student graduations in 2021. For some time now, the university has had more female than male students. At the end of 2024, women accounted for 60% of students.

== Location ==

The University of Bern does not have a single large campus on the edge of the city, but has consistently pursued the principle of a university in the city. Most institutes and clinics are still in the Länggasse, the traditional university district adjoining the city centre, within walking distance of one another. The Faculty of Theology and various institutes in the Faculty of Humanities are now housed in an old chocolate factory (the &quot;Unitobler&quot;), and in 2005 the former women&#x27;s hospital was refurbished to serve as a university centre for institutes in the Faculty of Law and Department of Economics (the &quot;UniS&quot;). The vonRoll site, another former factory building, is in the process of being refurbished to house the Faculty of Human Sciences and the Department of Social Sciences.

== History ==

=== Early history: Collegiate school and academy (1500–1834) ===
The roots of the University of Bern go back to the sixteenth century, when a collegiate school was needed to train new pastors after the Reformation. As part of its reorganization of higher education, the government of Bern transformed the existing theological college into an academy with four faculties in 1805. Henceforth, it was possible to study not only theology in Bern, but also law and medicine.

=== The old university: New beginning and development (1834–1900) ===
As in other countries of Europe, nineteenth-century politics in Switzerland were dominated by the struggle between conservative and liberal currents. The liberals gained control of the Canton of Bern in 1831 and in 1834 turned the academy into a university, with an academic staff of 45 to teach 167 students. Owing to the political situation, it was not until the promulgation of the federal constitution in 1848 that the university was able to embark on a period of peaceful development. Between 1885 and 1900, the number of students doubled from 500 to 1,000. As a result, at the turn of the twentieth century the University of Bern was the largest university in Switzerland. This rapid growth reflected the university&#x27;s attraction for foreign students, in particular Germans and Russians, who accounted for half of the total enrollment. It was also Russian female students who in the 1870s won the right for women to study.

=== The new university: New building and consolidation (1900–1950) ===
With the growing prosperity of the city of Bern, the university in the Länggasse quarter expanded at the end of the 19th century. In 1903, a new Main Building was inaugurated on the Grosse Schanze and the number of faculties increased. In 1908–09, three prominent persons put the University of Bern in the limelight. In 1908, Albert Einstein taught the first of three semesters of theoretical physics. The following year, Anna Tumarkin, a Russian philosopher, was appointed to an extraordinary professorship and thus became the first female professor at a European university entitled to examine doctoral and post-doctoral theses. Also in 1909, Theodor Kocher, a Bernese surgeon, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. In the following years the university consolidated its position as a small centre of higher learning with a stable enrollment of about 2,000 students.

=== The modern university: Expansion and reorganization (1950–2000) ===
After World War II, a growing number of voices called for the expansion of tertiary education in Switzerland. The rapid growth in the 1950s and 1960s (enrollment at the University of Bern had already reached 5,000 in 1968) – generated pressure for expansion. The completely revised University Act of 1996 transformed the University of Bern from an administrative division of the Department of Education of the Canton of Bern into an autonomous institution. a legal entity in its own right. The Act clearly defined the competencies of the university and of the state. The university passed another milestone in 1992, when its enrollment reached 10,000.

=== The university today: Bologna Reform and restructuring (since 2000) ===
The Bologna Declaration ushered in the era of ECTS credits and the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree structure. The university set strategic research priorities, such as climate research, and promoted inter-university cooperation. At the same time, the university reorganized its faculties. With the amendment to the University Act in summer 2010, the University Board of Directors acquired the right to choose its own ordinary professors and keep its own accounts separate from the state.

The University Board of Directors formulated a strategy in 2013, whixh builds on the previous strategy of 2006, the 2012 mission statement, and the performance mandate for the university from the Cantonal Government.

== Structure ==

=== Faculties ===

The University of Bern has eight faculties:
* Theology
* Law
* Business, Economics and Social Sciences
* Medicine
* Veterinary Medicine (Vetsuisse)
* Humanities
* Science
* Human Sciences

The medical faculties of the Universities of Bern and Basel have formed a strategic alliance in the fields of cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, pathology and microbiology. The Vetsuisse Faculty was created in 2006 through the merger of the Faculties of veterinary medicine of the Universities of Bern and Zurich. The Humanities Faculty is comparable to the arts and sciences departments of American universities and offers majors in the three areas of art and culture, archaeology and history, and languages and literature. The Faculty of Science focuses on the natural and life sciences. The Human Sciences Faculty was founded in 2005 and offers study programmes in education, sports and psychology.

=== Academic programs ===

As a comprehensive university, Bern covers a wide range of classical university courses in some 39 bachelor, 71 master and 69 advanced study programs. The Physics Institute contributed to the first flight to the Moon and still carries out experiments and provides apparatus for NASA and ESA space missions on a regular basis.

In addition to the classical disciplines, the University of Bern has also established programmes in newer ones such as sports science and theatre studies. It is the only institution in Switzerland with a theatre studies course that enables students to major in dance in their master program. 
The University of Bern also offers the Master in Applied Economic Analysis (MAEA), which is the only university-level program in Switzerland with focus on applied economic analysis. The Graduate Schools for doctoral candidates offer further-reaching programmes that are closely linked to the university&#x27;s research priorities in the fields of climate science, health care and penal law and criminology.

=== General university institutions ===
There are six centres with specialized roles and interfaculty units maintained by the University of Bern:
* Collegium generale (CG)
* Walter Benjamin Kolleg (WBKolleg)
* Interdisciplinary Centre for Gender Studies (ICFG)
* Microscopy Imaging Center (MIC)
* Experimental Animal Center (EAC)
* Centre for Continuing University Education (Zentrum für universitäre Weiterbildung, ZUW)

The function of these general university institutions is to promote dialogue between students in different disciplines and faculties through interdisciplinary events for academic staff and students. The Centre for Continuing University Education (ZUW) focuses on scientific further education. The selection of topics in the ZUW programmes ranges from public administration through dentistry to spiritual guidance. In addition, the University of Bern has also taken the lead in the German-speaking world in creating a number of novel study programmes, for instance Evaluation.

=== Interdisciplinary centres ===

The university has defined specific strategic focuses of research and established interdisciplinary centres for research and teaching. The biomedical engineering programmes of the Artificial Organ (ARTORG) Center for Biomedical Engineering Research and the Public Management and Policy programme of the Center of Competence for Public Management (CCPM).

There are 10 strategic centres and interfaculty units at the University of Bern:
* Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics (AEC)
* ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research
* Bern Center for Precision Medicine (BCPM)
* Centre for Development and Environment (CDE)
* Center for Regional Economic Development (CRED)
* Center for Space and Habitability (CSH)
* Center of Competence for Public Management (KPM)
* Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases (MCID)
* Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)
* World Trade Institute (WTI)

A number of the university&#x27;s centres focus on the challenges of sustainability. The Centre for Development and Environment (CDE) manages research programmes in the field of sustainable development, focusing on its particular areas of expertise in integrated regional development and natural resource management. The World Trade Institute (WTI) manages research, education, and outreach focused on global economic governance, including global sustainability policy. The Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR) is at the forefront of international research on climate science and policy, and its researchers have participated as co-chair, coordinating lead authors or lead authors in all the assessment reports so far published by the IPCC.

The Center for Regional Economic Development (CRED) is an interfaculty center for research, teaching and consulting in regional economic development. Researchers from the research units Economics, Entrepreneurship, Geography and Tourism deal with research questions regarding the following research areas: Location dynamics and regional economic policy, Tourism as well as Land use policy and real estate.

The Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) leads the European CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite) project. CHEOPS is a planned European space telescope for the study of the formation of extrasolar planets, with a launch window in October to November 2019.

Several of the centers offer specialized graduate programmes.

<text>The history of the United Nations has its origins in World War II beginning with the Declaration of St James&#x27;s Palace. Taking up the Wilsonian mantle in 1944–1945, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed as his highest postwar priority the establishment of the United Nations to replace the defunct League of Nations. Roosevelt planned that it would be controlled by the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China. He expected this Big Four would resolve all major world problems at the powerful Security Council. However the UN was largely paralyzed by the veto of the Soviet Union when dealing with Cold War issues from 1947 to 1989. Since then its aims and activities have expanded to make it the archetypal international body in the early 21st century.

== Background ==
The first international organizations were created to enable countries to cooperate on specific matters. The International Telegraph Union was founded in 1865 and the Universal Postal Union was established in 1874. Both are now specialized agencies of the United Nations. In 1899, the Hague Convention established the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organization which began work in 1902.

The predecessor of the UN, the League of Nations, was conceived after World War I, and established in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles &quot;to promote international cooperation and to achieve peace and security.&quot; The main constitutional organs of the League were the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. The Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant and established by the Council and Assembly. The International Labour Organization, which is also now a UN specialized agency, was created under the попа Treaty of Versailles as an affiliated agency of the League. In addition, there were several auxiliary agencies and commissions.

==Origins==
The genesis of the UN is a series of conferences and declarations made by the Allies of World War II.

=== London Declaration ===
On 12 June 1941 representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as a representative of General de Gaulle of France met in London. They signed the Declaration of St. James&#x27;s Palace expressing a vision for a postwar world order. This was the first step that led up to the founding of the United Nations.

=== Atlantic Charter ===
The Atlantic Conference followed on 9–12 August 1941 at which American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill laid out this vision in a more detailed form in the Atlantic Charter. At the subsequent meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the eight governments in exile of countries under Axis occupation, together with the Soviet Union and representatives of the Free French Forces, unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and United States.

===Declaration by United Nations===
President Roosevelt first suggested using the name &quot;United Nations&quot;, to refer to the Allies of World War II, to Prime Minister Churchill during the latter&#x27;s three-week visit to the White House in December 1941. Churchill agreed and cited Lord Byron&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;United Nations&quot; in the poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, which referred to the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

The 1942 &quot;Declaration of The United Nations&quot; was drafted by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, while meeting at the White House on 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. The first official use of the term &quot;United Nations&quot; was on 1–2 January 1942 when 26 Governments signed the Declaration. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted. With the text finalized by the Big Three, the Chinese were invited to sign, and then the other Allies. By early 1945 it had been signed by 21 more states.

A JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA

The Governments signatory hereto,

Having subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,

Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,

DECLARE:

(1) Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war.

(2) Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies.

The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.
During the war, the United Nations became the official term for the Allies. To join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.

===Moscow and Tehran conferences===
The first commitments to the creation of a future international organization emerged in declarations signed at the 1943 wartime Allied conferences. 

At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden agreed to draft a declaration that included a call for “a general international organization, based on the principle sovereign equality of all nations.” 

President Roosevelt promoted the Four Powers idea. The Moscow Conference resulted in the Moscow Declarations on 30 October 1943, including the Declaration of the Four Nations on General Security. This declaration omitted any discussion of the potentially-controversial establishment of a permanent peacekeeping force after the war; instead, its stated aim was simply the creation &quot;at the earliest possible date of a general international organization.&quot; It was drafted by US State Department and signed by the foreign secretaries of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. This was the first formal announcement that a new international organization was being contemplated to replace the moribund League of Nations. 

The Tehran Conference followed at which Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met and discussed the idea of a post-war international organization.

=== Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta conferences ===

The Allies agreed to the basic structure of the new body at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944. From 21 September to 7 October, delegations from the Big Four met in Washington, D.C. to elaborate plans. Those and later talks produced proposals outlining the purposes of the new international organization, its membership and organs, as well as arrangements to maintain international peace and security and international economic and social cooperation. Churchill urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major Power after the liberation of Paris in August 1944.

For Roosevelt, creating the new organization became the most important goal for the entire war effort. It was his idea that &quot;Four Policemen&quot; would collaborate to keep and enforce the peace. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and China would make the major decisions. He went public with strong advocacy in the 1944 presidential campaign, and turned detailed planning over to the State Department, where Sumner Welles and Secretary Cordell Hull worked on the project. Governments, organizations and private citizens worldwide discussed and debated these proposals.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the structure of the United Nations Security Council. Stalin insisted on having a veto and FDR finally agreed; thus avoiding the fatal weakness of the League of Nations, which had theoretically been able to order its members to act in defiance of their own parliaments. It was agreed that membership would be open to nations that had joined the Allies by 1 March 1945. Brazil, Syria and a number of other countries qualified for membership by declarations of war on either Germany or Japan in the first three months of 1945 – in some cases retroactively.

===San Francisco conference===

On 25 April 1945, the United Nations Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco sponsored by the Big Four. The heads of the delegations of the four sponsoring countries invited the other nations to take part and took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings: Anthony Eden, of Britain, Edward Stettinius, of the United States, T. V. Soong, of China, and Vyacheslav Molotov, of the Soviet Union. At the later meetings, Lord Halifax deputized for Eden, Wellington Koo for T. V. Soong, and Andrei Gromyko for Molotov. France was added as a permanent member of the Security Council at the insistence of Churchill.

After working for two months, the fifty nations represented at the conference signed the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June. The charter stated that before it would come into effect, it must be ratified by the governments of the China, France, the USSR, Great Britain and the United States, and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. This occurred on 24 October 1945, and the United Nations was officially formed.

The first meeting of the General Assembly was held in Westminster Central Hall, London, on 10 January 1946. The Security Council met for the first time a week later in Church House, Westminster. The League of Nations formally dissolved itself on 18 April 1946 and transferred its mission to the United Nations.

==Activities==

The United Nations has achieved considerable prominence in the social arena, fostering human rights, economic development, decolonization, health and education, for example, and interesting itself in refugees and trade.

The leaders of the UN had high hopes that it would act to prevent conflicts between nations and make future wars impossible. Those hopes have obviously not fully come to pass.

=== Decolonization ===
G. J. Eddy Gouraige argues that UN resolutions from 1946 to 1960 made decolonization a top priority, and gave the General Assembly tools to end colonialism. Nearly all the main colonies of the British French and Dutch empires gained independence by the 1960s. However, critics complained that the UN did little to end Portuguese colonization.

===Korean War 1950–1953 and after===
United Nations Command is the multinational military force established to support the Republic of Korea (South Korea) during and after the Korean War. It was the first international unified command in history, and the first attempt at collective security pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations.

The UNC was established on 7 July 1950 following the UN Security Council&#x27;s recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea. The motion passed because the Soviet Union, a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN at the time over its recognition of the Republic of China rather than the People&#x27;s Republic of China. UN member states were called to provide assistance in repelling the North&#x27;s invasion, with the UNC providing a cohesive command structure under which the disparate forces would operate. During the course of the war, 22 nations contributed military or medical personnel to UN Command; although the United States led the UNC and provided the bulk of its troops and funding, all participants formally fought under the auspices of the UN, with the operation classified as a &quot;UN-led police action&quot;.

On 27 July 1953, United Nations Command, the Korean People&#x27;s Army, and the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteers signed the Korean Armistice Agreement, ending open hostilities. The agreement established the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), consisting of representatives of the signatories, to supervise the implementation of the armistice terms, and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of nations that did not participate in the conflict, to monitor the armistice&#x27;s restrictions on the parties&#x27; reinforcing or rearming themselves. In 1975, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 3390 (XXX), which called upon the parties to the Armistic Agreement to replace it with a peace agreement, and expressed the hope that UNC would be dissolved on 1 January 1976. The UNC continues to function .

Since 1953, UNC&#x27;s primary duties have been to maintain the armistice and facilitate diplomacy between North and South Korea. Although &quot;MAC&quot; meetings have not occurred since 1994, UN Command representatives routinely engage members of the Korean People&#x27;s Army in formal and informal meetings. The most recent formal negotiations on the terms of Armistice occurred between October and November 2018. Duty officers from both sides of the Joint Security Area (commonly known as the Truce Village of Panmunjom) conduct daily communications checks and have the ability to engage face-to-face when the situation demands.

==Peacekeeping==

From about 1947 until 1989 the division of the world into hostile camps during the Cold War made agreement on peacekeeping matters extremely difficult. Following the end of the Cold War, renewed calls arose for the UN to become the agency for achieving world peace and co-operation, as several dozen active military conflicts continued to rage across the globe. The breakup of the Soviet Union had also left the United States in a unique position of global dominance, creating a variety of new problems for the UN (See the United States and the United Nations)

In 1948 the UN created the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). Up to the late 1980s, peacekeeping missions were operated by six officials in the United Nations Office of Special Political Affairs, which was headed first by Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche, and subsequently Brian Urquhart and Marrack Goulding. From the beginning, peacekeeping operations operated with a clear doctrine that applied to its traditional or classical peacekeeping operations for inter-state ceasefires: peacekeepers did not take sides or discharge firearms, save in self-defense, or meddle in politics.

The Department of Peacekeeping Operations was created in March 1992 when Boutros Boutros-Ghali took office as Secretary-General of the United Nations; its creation was one of his first decisions. In organisational terms, it upgraded and expanded upon the work of the previous Field Administration and Logistics Division (FALD) (which remained active as a subordinate department). Goulding became under-secretary-general (or USG) for peacekeeping with Kofi Annan appointed as his deputy. The role of the DPKO, however, wasn&#x27;t clarified until June 1992, when Boutrous-Ghali issued &quot;An Agenda for Peace,&quot; a plan to strengthen the UN&#x27;s capacity for preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.

French nationals have served as Under-Secretaries-General for Peacekeeping Operations since 1997.

===Cyprus===
The United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus is a demilitarized zone, patrolled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), that was established in 1964 and extended in 1974 after the ceasefire of 16 August 1974, following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the &quot;de facto&quot; partition of the island into the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus (excluding the Sovereign Base Areas) and the largely unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the North. The zone, also known as the Green Line (, &quot;Prasini Grammi&quot;; ), stretches for from Paralimni in the east to Kato Pyrgos in the west, where a separate section surrounds Kokkina.

===India–Pakistan===
The United Nations India–Pakistan Observation Mission (UNIPOM), is a peacekeeping mission set up by the Security Council in September 1965 to oversee the ceasefire and withdrawal of armed personnel along the India–Pakistan border.

==Facilities==

Potential sites for the UN Headquarters included Vienna, Switzerland, Berlin, Quebec, and the Netherlands before the delegation decided on a headquarters in the United States by December 1945. Many U.S. locations vied for the honor of hosting the UN Headquarters site, such as Marin County, California; St. Louis; Boston; Chicago; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Westchester County, New York; Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens; Tuskahoma, Oklahoma; the Black Hills of South Dakota; Belle Isle in Detroit; and a site on Navy Island straddling the U.S.-Canada border. San Francisco, where the UN founding conference was held, was favored by Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Philippines due to the city&#x27;s proximity to their countries. The UN and many of its delegates seriously considered Philadelphia for the headquarters; the city offered to donate land in several select sites, including Fairmount Park, Andorra, and a location in Center City, Philadelphia, that would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from Independence Hall to Penn&#x27;s Landing.

In 1946, John D. Rockefeller III and Laurance Rockefeller each offered their respective residences in Kykuit in Mount Pleasant, New York, as headquarters for the UN, but the proposals were vetoed as the sites were too isolated from Manhattan. The Soviet Union vetoed Boston due to the denunciations of Soviet expansion by John E. Swift, a Massachusetts judge and Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus.

Prior to the completion of the UN&#x27;s current headquarters, it used part of a Sperry Gyroscope Company factory in Lake Success, New York, for most of its operations, including the Security Council, between 1946 and 1952. Between 1946 and 1950, the General Assembly met at the New York City Pavilion in Flushing Meadows, which had been built for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair (now the site of the Queens Museum).

New York City Planning Commissioner Robert Moses convinced Nelson Rockefeller to purchase a piece of land along the East River in New York City from real estate developer William Zeckendorf Sr.; The purchase was funded by Nelson&#x27;s father, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The Rockefeller family owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue from the Zeckendorf site. The UN ultimately chose the New York City site over Philadelphia after Rockefeller offered to donate the land along the East River. The UN headquarters officially opened on 9 January 1951, although construction was not formally completed until 9 October 1952.

==Structure and associated organizations==
The basic constitutional makeup of the United Nations has changed little, though vastly increased membership has altered the functioning of some elements. The UN as a whole has generated a rich assortment of non-governmental organizations and special bodies over the years: some with a regional focus, some specific to the various peacekeeping missions, and others of global scope and importance. Other bodies (such as the International Labour Organization) formed prior to the establishment of the United Nations and only subsequently became associated with it.

<doc id="1157544" wikidata="Q172542" url="?curid=1157544" title="Reform of the United Nations">
<text>Since the late 1990s there have been many calls for reforms of the United Nations (UN). However, there is little clarity or consensus about what reform might mean in practice. Both those who want the UN to play a greater role in world affairs and those who want its role confined to humanitarian work or otherwise reduced use the term &quot;UN reform&quot; to refer to their ideas. The range of opinion extends from those who want to eliminate the UN entirely, to those who want to make it into a full-fledged world government. Secretaries-General have presented numerous ways to implement these new reforms. There have been reform efforts since the creation of the UN and closely associated with each of the Secretaries-General.

On 1 June 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Atul Khare of India to spearhead efforts to implement a reform agenda aimed at streamlining and improving the efficiency of the world body. Khare led the Change Management Team (CMT) at the UN, working with both departments and offices within the Secretariat and with other bodies in the UN system and the 193 member states. The CMT was tasked with guiding the implementation of a reform agenda at the UN that started with the devising of a wide-ranging plan to streamline activities, increasing accountability and ensuring the organization was more effective and efficient in delivering its many mandates and protocols.

==Timeline of reforms==
The United Nations has undergone phases of reform since its foundation in 1945. During the first years, the first decisive change was the development of peacekeeping measures to oversee the implementation of ceasefire agreements in 1949 in the Middle East and one year later in the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. The Soviet Union launched reform initiatives during the East-West antagonism in the 1950s to curtail the independence of the Secretariat by replacing the post of Secretary-General with a troika, including a representative from the socialist states. Decolonization created rapid growth in UN membership, and by 1965 it stood at 118, twice as much as at the Organization&#x27;s founding.

With states from Africa and Asia joining the United Nations, development issues became increasingly important, resulting in the expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on a New International Economic Order (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by financial crisis and the retreat of the United States, which triggered a reform of the budgetary process and the downsizing of the Organization. With the end of the Cold War, the rediscovery of and renaissance of the United Nations were hailed; the first half of the 1990s saw a major expansion of the Organization and the reform associated with the Agenda for Peace launched by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

A string of new peacekeeping missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered interest in the reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international &#x27;responsibility to protect&#x27; populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.

As of 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon continued the reform agenda covering oversight, integrity, and ethics which had previously been launched in response to investigation of the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. The Programme responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilians and was the largest, most complex and most ambitious relief effort in the history of the United Nations. With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international environmental governance, a unified gender organization, and &#x27;Delivering as One&#x27; at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities.

==Reform ideas==
===Security Council reform===

A very frequently discussed change to the UN structure is to change the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945. Various proposals have been put forward, including ones by the G4 nations, the Uniting for Consensus group, and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, suggesting that other nations – most notably Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan – should also have permanent membership, to allow for a more equitable representation within the council.

===UN Secretariat Transparency reform===
At another level, calls for reforming the UN demand to make the UN administration (usually called the UN Secretariat or &quot;the bureaucracy&quot;) more transparent, more accountable, and more efficient, including direct election of the Secretary-General by the people as in a presidential system.

UN Secretariat/administration reforms seldom gets much attention in the media, though within the Organization they are seen as widely contentious issues. They run the bureaucracy of the UN, responding to the decisions by the Member States in the Security Council and the General Assembly.

Mark Malloch Brown, the former administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, attributes the inefficiency of the UN administration to the &quot;disconnect between the merit and reward&quot; and further advocates &quot;reconnecting merit to make the UN again an international meritocracy&quot; to overcome the problem. He believes that the UN must stop promoting on the basis of political correctness that encourages promoting staffs proportionately from certain regions of the world, but instead make more use of Asia, Africa and other so-called less developed regions that now offer a large pool of talented, skilled, and highly motivated professionals. He argues that these individuals who are highly qualified will readily move up through the UN system without need of the &quot;cultural relativism which is used to promote incompetents.&quot;
A somewhat related point is often made by UN member states from the developing world, who complain that some of the most desirable senior posts within the Secretariat are filled under a &quot;tradition&quot; of regional representation that favours the United States and other affluent nations. The point has been made forcefully by Ambassador Munir Akram of Pakistan, who was recently head of the G-77. &quot;The major countries, the major powers hold very high positions in the Secretariat and support their national interests and refuse to allow the Secretary-General to cut departments,&quot; he claims. And when they do ask for budget cuts, they do it &quot;where it does not affect their national interests.&quot; He labels this &quot;a double standard which is applied or is thought to be applied in the Secretariat, and we as overseers of the G-77 do not accept this double standard.&quot;

Among the notable efforts of Secretariat reform since 2005 is the Secretary-General&#x27;s report &quot;Investing in the United Nations&quot; from March 2006 and the &quot;Comprehensive review of governance and oversight within the UN&quot;, June the same year. From the Member States side there is the Four Nations Initiative, a cooperation project by Chile, South Africa, Sweden and Thailand to promote governance and management reforms, aiming at increased accountability and transparency.

===Democracy reform===
Another frequent demand is that the UN become &quot;more democratic&quot;, and a key institution of a world democracy. This raises fundamental questions about the nature and role of the UN. The UN is not a world government, but rather a forum for the world&#x27;s sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action. A direct democracy would request the presidential election of the UN Secretary-General by direct vote of the citizens of the democratic countries (world presidentialism) as well as the General Assembly (just as cities, states and nations have their own representatives in many systems, who attend specifically to issues relevant to the given level of authority) and the International Court of Justice. Others have proposed a combination of direct and indirect democracy, whereby national governments might ratify the expressed will of the people for such important posts as an empowered World Court.

===Calls for diversity and democracy===

Implementation of population-based UN voting also raises the problems of diversity of interests and governments of the various nations. The nations in the UN contain representative democracies as well as absolute dictatorships and many other types of government. Allowing large powers to vote their population&#x27;s interests &quot;en bloc&quot; raises the question of whether they would really represent the interests and desires of their individual citizens and the world community. Anything like direct election would be impossible as well in the many nations where an accurate direct vote would be impossible or where the local government has power to influence the local voters as well as security of the ballot box. Giving the UN any kind of actual governance power raises the question of how these powers could be carried out. What would happen when a vote of the UN General Assembly demands changes in the borders or political status of a nation, or requires citizens in some nations to tax themselves in favour of other nations, or demands the arrest of the leader of a nation, and is met by refusal?

The subsidiarity principle resolves some of these issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It can be compared to federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.

===Financing reform===
On the subject of financing, Paul Hawken made the following proposal in his book &quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot;: &quot;A tax on missiles, planes, tanks, and guns would provide the UN with its entire budget, as well as pay for all peacekeeping efforts around the world, including the resettlement of refugees and reparations to the victims of war.&quot;

The main problem with implementing such a radical tax would be finding acceptance. Although such a system might find acceptance within some nations, particularly those (1) with a history of neutrality, (2) without an active military (such as Costa Rica), or (3) with lower levels of military spending (such as Japan, which currently spends 1% of its GDP on defence), it would be unpopular among many consumers of arms. Nations in this latter category range from the United States, which spends 4% of its GDP on defence, to dictatorships who depend on arms to keep themselves in power. Other likely opponents would be nations engaged in ongoing military conflicts, or others in a state of heightened military alert, such as Israel. Arms producers would also oppose it, because it would increase their costs and possibly reduce their consumer base.

Another tax that the UN might promote would be some sort of global resources dividend.

===Human rights reform===
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights came under fire during its existence for the high-profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee the human rights of their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot; report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.

On Wednesday, 15 March 2006, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing a new United Nations Human Rights Council, the successor to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with the resolution receiving approval from 170 members of the 191-nation Assembly. Only the United States, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Israel voted against the Council&#x27;s creation, claiming that it would have too little power and that there were insufficient safeguards to prevent human rights-abusing nations from taking control.

The UNHRC has itself been criticised for the repressive states among its membership. The UNHRC has also been accused of anti-Israel bias, a particular criticism being its focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at each session as Agenda Item 7.

==Relocation proposals==
Due to the significance of the organization, proposals to relocate its headquarters have occasionally been made. Complainants about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries, as well as the high costs to the city. A US telephone survey in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favored moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the US, such as Iran and Russia, are especially vocal in questioning the current location of the United Nations, arguing that the United States government could manipulate the work of the General Assembly through selective access to politicians from other countries, with the aim of having an advantage over rival countries. In the wake of the Snowden global surveillance disclosures, the subject of the relocation of the UN headquarters was again discussed, this time for security reasons.

Among the cities that have been proposed to house the headquarters of the United Nations are Saint Petersburg, Montreal, Dubai, Jerusalem, and Nairobi.

Critics of relocation say that the idea would be expensive and would also involve the withdrawal of the United States from the organization, and with it much of the agency&#x27;s funding. They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.

==Creation, removals and additions for proposed UN reform==

===Creation of United Nations Parliamentary Assembly===

A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, or United Nations People&#x27;s Assembly (UNPA), is a proposed addition to the United Nations System that eventually would allow for direct election of UN Parliament members by citizens of all over the world.

Proposals for a UNPA date back to the UN&#x27;s formation in 1945, but largely stagnated until the 1990s. They have recently gained traction amidst increasing globalization, as national parliamentarians and citizens groups seek to counter the growing influence of unelected international bureaucracies.

===Creation of United Nations Environment Organization===

Following the publication of Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC in February 2007, a &quot;Paris Call for Action&quot; read out by French President Jacques Chirac and supported by 46 countries, called for the United Nations Environment Programme to be replaced by a new and more powerful United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO), to be modelled on the World Health Organization. The 46 countries included the European Union member states, but notably did not include the United States, China, Russia, and India, the top four emitters of greenhouse gases.

===Placing all UN Development Agencies and Specialized Programmes under a UNDG===
Secretary-General Kofi Annan streamlined all UN Agencies working on International Development Issues under a new United Nations Development Group, chaired by the Administrator of the UNDP. The Delivering as One concept was also introduced.
The main normative instrument for reforming the UN development system is the Quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR). Following an assessment of progress, this General Assembly resolution which designs and gives mandates to the UN system to better address reform objectives is negotiated every four years. The most recent QCPR was adopted in December 2012.

===Removal of spent provisions in UN Charter===
Several provisions of the United Nations Charter are no longer relevant. &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot; proposed the removal of these provisions:

*Since there are no longer any trust territories, the Trusteeship Council no longer serves any purpose. Thus, Chapter XIII of the Charter is no longer relevant, and can be deleted.
*Due to Cold War disagreements, the Military Staff Committee never succeeded in its intended purpose. Although it formally still meets every two weeks, it has been effectively inactive since 1948. Thus, article 47, and the references to it in articles 26, 45 and 46 can be deleted.
*The &quot;enemy clauses&quot; in articles 53 and 107 contain special provisions relating to the members of the Axis in World War II (Germany, Japan, etc.) Some nations consider these to be no longer relevant; Japan in particular would like to see them removed.

There are also other provisions of the UN Charter that deal with transitional arrangements, and thus are now spent. For example, article 61(3) and article 109(3). However, &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot; does not contain any proposals with respect to these provisions.

Due to the difficulty in amending the Charter, it is unlikely that any of these spent provisions will be amended except as part of a package making substantive amendments, such as Security Council reform. Further, while &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot; proposes that certain provisions be removed, there is not universal agreement. One school of thought in particular suggests that the Military Staff Committee could be revitalized by member states finally meeting their Article 45 commitments to provide a force able to perform peacemaking and peace enforcement under the legitimacy of the United Nations flag.

== Policy research ==
The Center for UN Reform Education (CURE) is an independent policy research organization founded in 1978 to publish research on proposals to reform the United Nations. Associated with the Department of Publication Information (DPI) of the United Nations, it does not take positions on specific proposals. Issues covered by CURE monographs, papers, articles, and books have included &quot;weighted voting, E-democracy, and restructuring of the UN&#x27;s principal organs including the Security Council and the General Assembly&quot;.

<doc id="1157568" wikidata="Q436627" url="?curid=1157568" title="Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence">
<text>Lady Isabel Neville (5 September 1451 – 22 December 1476) was the elder daughter and co-heiress of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (the &quot;Kingmaker&quot; of the Wars of the Roses), and Anne de Beauchamp, suo jure 16th Countess of Warwick. She was the wife of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. She was also the elder sister of Anne Neville, wife and consort of Clarence&#x27;s brother, Richard III.

==Life==
Isabel Neville was born at Warwick Castle, the seat of the Earls of Warwick, on 5 September 1451. 

On 11 July 1469, Isabel secretly married George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, the younger brother of Edward IV, in Église Notre-Dame de Calais. The marriage was arranged against the King&#x27;s wishes by her father, and the ceremony was conducted by Isabel&#x27;s uncle George Neville, archbishop of York. The marriage without his consent angered Edward, as until he had a son with his wife Elizabeth Woodville, Clarence was his heir presumptive. Following the marriage, Clarence joined forces with Warwick and allied with the Lancastrians led by Margaret of Anjou, queen consort to Henry VI. 

After Isabel Neville&#x27;s sister Anne was married to Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the son and heir of Henry VI, Clarence rejoined his brother, realizing that it was now unlikely that he would become king. Letters, from King Edward, were taken to Clarence by an unnamed lady who came to visit Isabel before Warwick and Clarence invaded England for the Lancastrians in September 1470. Inside these letters were promises of reconciliation from the king if Clarence abandoned the cause of Warwick and the Lancastrians. Clarence replied that he would join King Edward as soon as was conveniently possible.

==Marriage and children==

Isabel Neville married George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, in Calais, France, on 11 July 1469. Four children resulted: 
*No name (c. 17 April 1470), born outside Calais whilst Isabel and her husband were fleeing England. Died at sea. Identified by some sources as a girl named Anne, and by others as an unnamed boy.
* Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury (14 August 1473 – 27 May 1541). Married Sir Richard Pole; had five children; executed by Henry VIII.
* Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick (25 February 1475 – 28 November 1499). Executed by Henry VII for attempting to escape from the Tower of London.
* Richard of Clarence (5 October 1476 – 1 January 1477), born at Tewkesbury Abbey, Gloucestershire, died at Warwick Castle, Warwickshire, buried Warwick.

==Death==
Isabel Neville died on 22 December 1476, two and a half months after the birth of Richard. It is now thought the cause was either consumption or childbed fever (puerperal fever), yet at the time her husband accused one of her ladies-in-waiting of having murdered her with a poisoned drink. He committed in his turn a notorious judicial murder of the lady, called Ankarette Twynyho.

Ankarette&#x27;s grandson Roger Twynyho received from Edward IV a full retrospective pardon for Ankarette, and the petition he submitted to the king in 1478 describes fully the circumstances of the case, well illustrating the quasi-kingly high-handedness of Clarence, which was ultimately not tolerated by the king:
&quot;That whereas the said Ankarette on Saturday, 12 April, 17 Edward IV [i.e.1477], was in her manor at Cayford [i.e. Keyford, Somerset] and Richard Hyde late of Warwick, gentleman, and Roger Strugge late of Bekehampton, co. Somerset, towker, with divers riotous persons to the number of fourscore by the command of George, duke of Clarence, came to Cayforde about two of the clock after noon and entered her house and carried her off the same day to Bath and from thence on the Sunday following to Circeter [i.e. Cirencester], co. Gloucester, and from thence to Warwick, whither they brought her on the Monday following about eight of the clock in the afternoon, which town of Warwick is distant from Cayforde seventy miles, and then and there took from her all her jewels, money and goods and also in the said duke&#x27;s behalf, as though he had used king&#x27;s power, commanded Thomas Delalynde, esquire, and Edith his wife, daughter of the said Ankarette, and their servants to avoid from the town of Warwick and lodge them at Strattforde upon Aven that night, six miles from thence, and the said duke kept Ankarette in prison unto the hour of nine before noon on the morrow, to wit, the Tuesday after the closing of Pasche [i.e. Easter], and then caused her to be brought to the Guildhall at Warwick before divers of the justices of the peace in the county then sitting in sessions and caused her to be indicted by the name of Ankarette Twynneowe, late of Warwick, widow, late servant of the duke and Isabel his wife, of having at Warwick on 10 October, 16 Edward IV., given to the said Isabel a venomous drink of ale mixed with poison, of which the latter sickened until the Sunday before Christmas, on which day she died, and the justices arraigned the said Ankarette and a jury appeared and found her guilty and it was considered that she should be led from the bar there to the gaol of Warwick and from thence should be drawn through the town to the gallows of Myton and hanged till she were dead, and the sheriff was commanded to do execution and so he did, which indictment, trial and judgment were done and given within three hours of the said Tuesday, and the jurors for fear gave the verdict contrary to their conscience, in proof whereof divers of them came to the said Ankarette in remorse and asked her forgiveness, in consideration of the imaginations of the said duke and his great might, the unlawful taking of the said Ankarette through three several shires, the inordinate hasty process and judgement, her lamentable death and her good disposition, the king should ordain that the record, process, verdict and judgement should be void and of no effect, but that as the premises were done by the command of the said duke the said justices and sheriff and the under-sheriff and their ministers should not be vexed. The answer of the king was: &quot;Soit fait comme il est désiré&quot; (&quot;Let it be done as the petitioner requests&quot;)&quot;.
Isabel was buried at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire.

<text>David Lipscomb (January 21, 1831 – November 11, 1917) was a minister, editor, and educator in the American Restoration Movement and one of the leaders of that movement, which, by 1906, had formalized a division into the Church of Christ (with which Lipscomb was affiliated) and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). James A. Harding and David Lipscomb founded the Nashville Bible School, now known as Lipscomb University in honor of the latter.

== Personal life ==
Lipscomb was born to Granville Lipscomb (born January 13, 1802, in Louisa County, Virginia, died November 16, 1853) and his second wife Ann E. Lipscomb (born January 25, 1799, in Louisa County, Virginia, died January 29, 1835, in Illinois) (called &quot;Nancy&quot; in some sources). Granville had previously been married, on December 14, 1825, in Spotsylvania, Virginia, to the former Ellen Guerner.

Granville and his older brother William Lipscomb were active in the Bean&#x27;s Creek Baptist Church, where they were listed as the church clerks for 1828–1831 (Granville Lipscomb) and 1844–1876 (William C. Lipscomb). Attempts to convert the Bean&#x27;s Creek church to Restoration Movement theology were poorly received, and Granville Lipscomb&#x27;s family was expelled in 1831. David Lipscomb was born in Huntland, Tennessee.

The Lipscomb family, originally Baptist, were said to have converted to Restoration Movement Christianity in the mid-1820s while reading Alexander Campbell&#x27;s periodical &quot;Christian Baptist&quot;, copies of which had been sent to the Lipscomb&#x27;s family by Ann&#x27;s sister Elizabeth (born &quot;ca.&quot; 1797) and brother-in-law, physician Lunsford Lindsay (born &quot;ca.&quot; 1793) of Todd County, Kentucky, who would later participate in the formation of the Cadiz Christian Church in 1837.

The Lipscombs were said to be charter members of the Old Salem church, according to Earl Irvin West&#x27;s Lipscomb biography, &quot;The Life and Times of David Lipscomb&quot;.

:The Old Salem congregation began in May 1834 with two male members and two females. Also, five colored people belonged. By Christmas that year the number had grown to thirty-four whites and twelve blacks.

The Lipscomb family moved to Illinois in 1834 for the purpose of freeing their slaves. David&#x27;s mother Ann, along with three of his siblings, died of a fever in 1835 while they were still in Illinois. David&#x27;s later belief that racial divisions in the church are inconsistent with Christianity were shaped by this experience.

Lipscomb&#x27;s father moved the rest of the family back to Tennessee in 1835 or 1836 and he married his third wife, Jane L. Breedan (died September 8, 1885), on April 11 or August 11, 1837. David&#x27;s half-brother, also named Granville, was born to Jane Breedan Lipscomb. William Lipscomb would help to found Neely&#x27;s Bend Church of Christ in April 1872 . Granville Lipscomb Jr. would become a leader in the Lebanon Church of Christ founded in 1879 in Weakley County, Tennessee.

Lipscomb was married to Margaret Zellner on July 22, 1862. Only one child was born to them. Little Zellner died at the age of 9 months of dehydration while teething. They reared, however, several foster children. David Lipscomb died on November 11, 1917, at the age of 86 years. Funeral services were held in the College Street Church, where he had been an elder for many years.

== Tolbert Fanning and Franklin College ==
Lipscomb, along with his older brother William, was greatly influenced by Nashville, Tennessee, church leader Tolbert Fanning. Lipscomb was baptized by Fanning in 1845. He entered Fanning&#x27;s Franklin College in 1846, graduating in 1849. While a student at Franklin, Lipscomb roomed with the father of Edward Ward Carmack.

Fanning was an enforcer of strict orthodoxy with regard to Restoration doctrines, seeing anything not specifically authorized by the New Testament as unnecessary and hence sinful addition to the &quot;primitive&quot; Christianity of the 1st century, which the movement was by definition dedicated to restoring.

== &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; ==
In this spirit, in 1855, Fanning and William Lipscomb began publishing a magazine aimed at dissemination of this view throughout the Restoration Movement, the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot;. Following the resumption of mail service, which had been interrupted by the American Civil War, David Lipscomb revived the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; in July 1866, with himself and Fanning as editors: Fanning withdrew making Lipscomb the sole editor until he was joined by P. S. Fall, John T. Walsh, Jacob Creath Jr., T. W. Brents, and Carroll Kendrick in 1867.

Although the &quot;Advocate&quot; has always been conservative and Bible based, the &quot;tone and direction&quot; has varied as editors have changed. When David Lipscomb was the editor, the focus was on seeking unity by following scripture exactly, and the &quot;Advocate&quot;&#x27;s editorial position was to reject anything that is not explicitly allowed by scripture. When Foy E. Wallace was editor the &quot;Advocate&quot; fought against dispensational premillennialism. Editor B. C. Goodpasture used the &quot;Advocate&quot; to oppose the &quot;non-institutional&quot; view within the Churches of Christ. Despite these differences in editorial focus, throughout its entire history the &quot;Advocate&quot; has consistently sought to promote Christianity based on New Testament precedents.

== Views on war and government ==

Lipscomb was deeply affected by the American Civil War, which prompted him to reevaluate his beliefs concerning the relationship between Christians and government. He shifted from being a strong supporter of American democracy to a more &quot;Mennonite-like&quot; view, no longer believing that Christians should participate in war or actively participate in government. The distinction between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world became central to his thinking. Lipscomb expressed these views during the war in the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; and after the war in a book titled &quot;Civil Government&quot;. Because he actively opposed the participation of Christians in war, he was often viewed as a traitor to the Confederate States of America and later to the United States. Lipscomb did believe the war had served a positive purpose by freeing the slaves, although he challenged the American Christian Missionary Society&#x27;s support of the war.

The radical libertarian scholar Edward Stringham has argued that Lipscomb had independently questioned common assumptions such as these:

# Governments need to make laws.
# Governments are created for the public good.
# Democracy is for the common good.

Stringham further describes Lipscomb&#x27;s beliefs as follows:

# Governments may seek to increase disorder to expand their power.
# People should abstain from voting, instead seeking change through persuasive and non-coercive methods.
# Peaceful civilization is not dependent on the state.
# Governments are created for the benefit of the rulers, not the people.

== Nashville Bible School ==
Lipscomb for a time was a prosperous farmer in addition to his religious activities, at one time operating his own ferry across the Cumberland River from his farm north of Nashville to the side of the river on which the main part of the city was located. He eventually relocated to an estate south of Nashville. Today, this estate is the campus of Lipscomb University. The log house in which he lived on his former farm has been dismantled and re-erected adjacent to his later home, which is used by the university for some social occasions.

In 1891, Lipscomb and James A. Harding founded the Nashville Bible School, the precursor to the current Lipscomb University, which was not named for him until after his death. As Lipscomb was a product of the predominant Southern culture of the time, this institution was segregated and was for many years solely for white students, necessitating a separate sister institution in North Nashville for black students, which was not totally dismantled and merged with the larger white school until the 1960s.

== Opposition to missionary societies and instrumental music ==
Lipscomb, along with his mentor Tolbert Fanning, opposed the newly formed American Christian Missionary Society. No disagreement existed over the need for evangelism, but many believed that missionary societies were not authorized by scripture and would compromise the autonomy of local congregations. The use of musical instruments in worship had been discussed in journal articles as early as 1849, and initial reactions were generally unfavorable. However, some congregations are known to have been using musical instruments in the 1850s and 1860s. Both acceptance of instruments and discussion of the issue grew after the American Civil War. Opponents argued that the New Testament provided no authorization for their use in worship, whereas supporters argued on the basis of expediency and Christian liberty. Affluent, urban congregations were more likely to adopt musical instruments, while poorer and more rural congregations tended to see them as &quot;an accommodation to the ways of the world.&quot; Although Lipscomb was slow to come to a decision on the issue, articulating his final position in 1878, he came firmly to oppose the use of musical instruments in worship. One biographer describes Lipscomb as taking &quot;a firm stand against the organization of human societies for the preaching of the gospel, and he as ably contended for the simple worship without the use of instrumental music, as taught in the New Testament.&quot;

A deeper theological concern for Lipscomb was the adoption of German liberal theology by many among the Disciples wing of the Restoration Movement. He perceived them as taking a direction very incompatible with the principles enunciated by Thomas and Alexander Campbell.

As the 19th century progressed, a division gradually developed between those whose primary commitment was to unity, and those whose primary commitment was to the restoration of the primitive church. Those whose primary focus was unity gradually took on &quot;an explicitly ecumenical agenda&quot; and &quot;sloughed off the restorationist vision.&quot; This group increasingly used the terms &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot; and &quot;Christian Churches&quot; rather than &quot;Churches of Christ.&quot; At the same time, those whose primary focus was restoration of the primitive church increasingly used the term &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; rather than &quot;Disciples of Christ.&quot; Lipscomb served as a moderate among those with conservative views, to the extent that Austin McGary described him as liberal, and he was more inclusive than either McGary or Daniel Sommer. But in 1906 Lipscomb answered the director of the U.S. religious census for the conservatives when they were asked if the Disciples of Christ were divided, to the effect that they were. In the religious census of 1906 some confusion pervaded the data as some who supported the missionary societies and instrumental music reported themselves as in the Churches of Christ and some who opposed the innovations still considered themselves Disciples of Christ.

== Churches of Christ ==
Thus in 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed the Christian Churches and the Churches of Christ as separate and distinct groups for the first time. This, however, was simply the recognition of a division that had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883. The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the rejection of musical instruments in the Churches of Christ. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860 with the introduction of organs in some churches. More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered.

After the division Disciples churches used &quot;Christian Church&quot; as the dominant designation for congregations. The approach to missionary work and the presence or absence of mechanical instruments were the most visible issues, but some deeper, underlying ones were inextricable from those issues. The process that led to the separation had begun prior to the American Civil War. In sum, for a movement based on Christian unity based on the Bible, one side went in the direction of unity and the other side went in the direction of Restorationism.

== Legacy ==
According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement&quot;, Lipscomb&#x27;s &quot;greatest contributions came through the Nashville Bible School, the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot;, and his other writings.&quot; The Nashville Bible School is now Lipscomb University.

The &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; has long been very influential in the Churches of Christ and was, during much of the twentieth century, the most influential journal within the brotherhood, helping to shape consensus views. As the Churches of Christ have no denominational hierarchy, through much of its history the views of the brotherhood have been heavily influenced by its journals and their editors (although an argument can be made that since the 1980s lectureship speakers and university leaders have tended to have more influence than editors).

<text>John Fell (1721–1798) was an American merchant and jurist. Born in New York City, he was engaged in overseas trade and had acquired a small fleet of ships by the time he moved to Bergen County, New Jersey, in the 1760s, and lived at &quot;Peterfield&quot;, a home in present-day Allendale, New Jersey that has become known as the &quot;John Fell House&quot;. He served as judge of the court of common pleas in Bergen County from 1766 to 1774. With the coming of the American Revolutionary War, he became chairman of Bergen County&#x27;s committee of correspondence and the committee of safety. He was Bergen County&#x27;s leading delegate to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey in 1775. In 1776 Fell was elected to a one-year term in the New Jersey Legislative Council representing Bergen County.

In 1777, Fell, who had been imprisoned by the British, was released to a private apartment thanks to a letter written on his behalf by Ethan Allen.

The John Fell House, also known as Peterfield, is located at 475 Franklin Turnpike () in Allendale, New Jersey. The house is located on the march route of Rochambeau&#x27;s army, on its way in 1781 to Yorktown, Virginia, and the Siege of Yorktown that would decide the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="1157578" wikidata="Q570755" url="?curid=1157578" title="Dispatcher">
<text>A dispatcher is a communications worker who receives and transmits information to coordinate operations of other personnel and vehicles carrying out a service. Emergency organizations including police departments, fire departments, and emergency medical services departments as well as civilian organizations such as motorcycle couriers, taxicab providers, trucking companies, railroads, bus systems, and public utility companies, use dispatchers to relay information, direct personnel, and coordinate their operations.

== Types of dispatchers ==
===Emergency dispatchers===
An emergency dispatcher, also known as public safety dispatcher, 9-1-1 dispatcher, or public safety telecommunicator receives calls from individuals who require emergency services, including police services, firefighting, and emergency medical services. Once information is obtained from the caller, the dispatcher activates the appropriate services necessary to respond to the nature of the call for help. The dispatcher also obtains and relays pertinent information to the field units to help ensure the adequacy and safety of the response.

Emergency dispatchers may use preapproved protocols to talk a caller or bystander through lifesaving medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, childbirth, and first aid. They may require certification.

In the United States, about 10% of all dispatchers employed in 2004 were public safety dispatchers.

===Transportation and service dispatchers===
A number of other organizations use dispatchers to respond to service calls, coordinate transportation schedules, and to organize the delivery of materials:
*A truck dispatcher is employed by a trucking company to monitor the delivery of freight over long distances and coordinate delivery pickup and drop-off schedules.
*A bus dispatcher monitors the schedules of their bus fleet and address any problems that arise during their operations.
*A tow-truck dispatcher responds to calls for emergency roadside assistance.
*A gas and water service dispatcher monitors their respective utilities and receive calls for emergency assistance that involve gas lines and water mains. 

In the United States, about 26% of all dispatchers employed in 2004 worked for transportation and warehousing industries.

===Railroad dispatchers===
A train dispatcher is employed by a railroad to direct and facilitate the movement of trains over an assigned territory, which is usually part, or all, of a railroad operating division. The dispatcher is also responsible for cost effective movement of trains and other on-track railroad equipment to optimize physical (trains) and human resource (crews) assets.
A crew dispatcher is also employed by the railroad to keep track of train crews and their assignments. The crew dispatcher is responsible for assigning train crew to trains based upon scheduled rosters, and also making real-time adjustments as necessary based on rail traffic conditions and delays. The crew dispatcher is normally assisted by a crew caller whose responsibility is to telephone the train and engine crews to advise them of time to report for duty. The crew dispatcher is also responsible for checking that each train and engine crew are properly qualified for their assignments and have had proper rest according to labour regulations.

===Airline or flight dispatchers===
A flight dispatcher assists in planning flight paths, taking into account wind speed, storms, aircraft performance and loading, and other conditions. Some dispatchers provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions or paths change. They usually work in the operations or control center of the airline.

==Working conditions and environment==

Dispatchers are responsible for monitoring all of the communications within a specific geographic area. Public safety dispatchers are responsible for all emergency communications that occur within the jurisdiction of their department. These workers receive and document incoming calls, transmit messages to appropriate personnel, and keep logs of the daily activities of their personnel. Public safety dispatchers usually work in a police station, a fire station, or a hospital. Other dispatchers work in centralized communication centers associated with their specific company or service.

Dispatchers of all kinds work with multiple communications systems depending on their function. These systems can include but not limited to telephones, radios, computers and computer-aided dispatch programs, video surveillance cameras, and ground-to-aircraft messaging systems such as ACARS. As a result of sitting for long periods and using such equipment, dispatchers can develop eye strain and back problems. Many dispatchers must also work irregular hours to provide 24-hour service, which includes night, weekend, and holiday hours.

Public safety dispatchers are usually the first point of contact between emergency services and the public. When receiving incoming calls for help, these dispatchers must ascertain the nature, location, and extent of the emergency. Callers requesting emergency assistance are often in a state of heightened emotional distress, which can make it difficult to obtain the information needed to handle the call appropriately. The working conditions of a public safety dispatcher may be particularly stressful compared to others because handling a call incorrectly may delay or misdirect emergency personnel, which could result in serious injury or even death. 

Human error can also produce deadly results for other types of dispatchers. A train dispatcher in Spain was found guilty of negligent homicide for a head-on train collision that occurred in June 2003. Nineteen people died and forty-eight were injured in a crash where the dispatcher allowed a passenger train to leave a station when a freight train was approaching the station on the same line.

==Training and employment==

Employment as a dispatcher does not usually require a level of education higher than a high school diploma, but many that work in the field hold liberal arts degrees. Employers prefer candidates with computer and clerical skills, communication skills, and the ability to work fast under pressure. 

Candidates for employment as public safety dispatchers may be required to pass written, oral, or performance tests and are governed by state or local regulations. Public safety dispatchers may also have to obtain certifications and attend additional training before or after they are employed by state or local governments to dispatch for police, fire, or emergency medical services. The level of training required for these dispatchers is typically the most extensive in comparison to other dispatch positions.

A standard certification requirement for public safety dispatchers is Terminal Operator certification for access to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database system. Access to this database system often allows additional access to the state-level system comparable to NCIC which allows public safety dispatchers to access motor vehicle registration and drivers license information as well as wants or warrants by various law enforcement agencies both statewide and national.

In addition to certifications, specialized training is also required or appropriated to public safety dispatchers. As public safety dispatchers are the first contact made between the public and emergency services, public safety dispatchers need to be able to extract a vast array of information out of the caller. Such specialized training for 911 dispatchers can include: suicide intervention, hostage negotiation, bomb threats, tactical dispatching (for SWAT teams), domestic violence and domestic and foreign terrorism countermeasures. Many are also trained as emergency medical dispatchers, able to give first aid instructions to victims or families prior to EMS arrival.

According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 266,000 people were employed as dispatchers in 2004. In addition, it is expected that a number of current dispatchers will either transfer to other occupations or leave the labor force, which will result in an increase of openings.

==Hardware==

The primary tool of the dispatcher is the dispatch console. A dispatch console is a system that interfaces to a private or public radio system, allowing the dispatcher to communicate directly with all field workers, police officers, EMS personnel, and others in order to coordinate their activities. Dispatchers use various hardware and software to create dispatch.

<doc id="1157583" wikidata="Q313956" url="?curid=1157583" title="Anil Kapoor">
<text>Anil Kapoor (born 24 December 1956) is an Indian actor and producer who works primarily in Hindi films, in addition to Indian television and international films.

== Early life ==
Anil Kapoor was born into a Punjabi Hindu family affiliated with the Arya Samaj on 24 December 1956 in Chembur to Nirmal Kapoor and film producer Surinder Kapoor. The family belongs to the greater Kapoor show business family. He is the second of four children. His elder brother, Boney Kapoor is a film producer and younger brother Sanjay Kapoor is an actor. The late legendary actress Sridevi and the producer Mona Shourie Kapoor, both Boney&#x27;s wives, were his sisters-in-law, and Sandeep Marwah, founder of the Noida Film City and owner of Marwah Studios, is his brother-in-law. The film actors Arjun Kapoor, Mohit Marwah and Ranveer Singh are his nephews, while actresses Janhvi Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor are his nieces. Prithviraj Kapoor was his father&#x27;s cousin.

Kapoor was educated at Our Lady of Perpetual Succour High School, Chembur, and at the St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai.

== Acting career ==
Kapoor made his debut in films in 1970, playing a younger version of Shashi Kapoor&#x27;s character in &quot;Tu Payal Mein Geet&quot;. The film, however, did not release theatrically.

=== 1980s: Breakthrough and stardom===
Anil Kapoor made his Hindi film debut with Umesh Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Hamare Tumhare&quot; (1979), in a small role. He then starred as a lead actor in the 1980 Telugu film, &quot;Vamsa Vruksham&quot; directed by veteran Bapu. In the same year, he also appeared in two more Hindi films – &quot;Ek Baar Kaho&quot; and &quot;Hum Paanch&quot;. In 1981, he appeared in M. S. Sathyu &#x27;s &quot;Kahan Kahan Se Guzar Gaya&quot;. After playing a small role in &quot;Shakti&quot; (1982), he made his Kannada film debut with Mani Ratnam&#x27;s debut directorial &quot;Pallavi Anu Pallavi&quot; (1983). He played his first Hindi film leading role in &quot;Woh Saat Din&quot; (1983) which was directed by Bapu and featured Padmini Kolhapure and Naseeruddin Shah. He gained recognition in Bollywood with Yash Chopra&#x27;s action drama &quot;Mashaal&quot; (1984) as a &quot;tapori&quot;, for which he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His &quot;tapori&quot; persona and stubble look was considered unconventional at the time, but would become fashionable in India many years later. Kapoor&#x27;s 1985 releases included &quot;Yudh&quot; and &quot;Saaheb&quot;. &quot;Yudh&quot; featured him uttering his iconic line &quot;Ek Dum Jhakaas&quot;. But it was &quot;Meri Jung&quot; (1985), wherein he played the role of an angry young lawyer fighting for justice that earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

He then played a comic tapori again in &quot;Karma&quot; (1986), the biggest hit of the year. Also in 1986, Kapoor played the role of a carefree playboy in the hit &quot;Janbaaz&quot;, co-starring Feroz Khan. Kapoor&#x27;s other release of 1986, &quot;Insaaf Ki Awaaz&quot; with Rekha, was a box office hit. In the same year, Basu Chatterjee directed &quot;Chameli Ki Shaadi&quot; where he was seen doing a comedic role.

He was the protagonist in Shekhar Kapur&#x27;s sci-fi film &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987), the biggest hit of the year. The film became one of his biggest box-office hits and shot him to superstardom. In 1988, he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, &quot;Tezaab&quot;, the biggest blockbuster of 1988. The same year also saw the release of &quot;Kasam&quot;, an action drama directed by Umesh Mehra. Anil proved to be the only saving grace in commercial failures like &quot;Ram-Avtar&quot; and &quot;Vijay&quot;. The following year, he delivered &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot; (which became the second-highest box office earner of 1989) featuring Madhuri Dixit in the chartbuster song &quot;One Two Ka Four&quot;. In &quot;Rakhwala&quot;, Kapoor played the role of a tapori, and the film was declared a success. Kapoor&#x27;s portrayal of an autistic man in &quot;Eeshwar&quot; (1989) was well-received and established his versatility as an actor, earning him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

=== 1990s: Leading man ===
The year 1990 saw him play a dual role, as twin brothers in the highly successful action comedy &quot;Kishen Kanhaiya&quot; and the same year, he further attained reasonable box-office success with &quot;Ghar Ho To Aisa&quot;. Kapoor came up with a critically acclaimed performance in &quot;Awaargi&quot;. Many critics called that his best performance ever but the film flopped at the box office. Also films like &quot;Jamai Raja&quot; and &quot;Jeevan Ek Sanghursh&quot;, out of which both of them were remakes of South Indian films, proved to be major flops. These films proved to be a setback in his career as 1990 was supposed to be the crowning year for Kapoor as the Hindi film industry&#x27;s biggest male star. But with these flops, Anil was on the bad foot.

This was followed by a highly praised performance as a middle-aged man in Yash Chopra&#x27;s intergenerational musical romantic drama &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991), opposite Sridevi, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, with Kapoor earning his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film proved to a landmark film of Indian cinema and Yash Chopra&#x27;s best work to date. It was the first film in which he appeared without a moustache. Although the film was an underwhelming success at the domestic box-office, it proved to be a major success overseas. Anil Kapoor&#x27;s 1991 releases, &quot;Benaam Badsha&quot; was accorded average status at the box office.

In 1992, Kapoor received his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his hard-hitting performance in Indra Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Beta&quot; – the biggest blockbuster of the year opposite Madhuri Dixit. Kapoor was highly impressive with his comic act in &quot;Khel&quot; and his comic timing was one of the highlights of the film. In 1993, Boney Kapoor&#x27;s much-delayed mega-budget, &quot;Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja&quot; was a disaster at the box-office and damaged Kapoor&#x27;s reputation as the industry&#x27;s biggest star at the time. The only major success in these years was &quot;Laadla&quot; (1994) again alongside Sridevi, a film produced by Nitin Manmohan. Kapoor gave a splendid performance as a simpleton lover in the musical romantic drama &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; opposite Manisha Koirala. Kapoor earned his sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. His other 1994 release, , opposite Juhi Chawla and Karisma Kapoor, was also a success. His 1995 release, &quot;Trimurti&quot; was a box-office disaster, though Kapoor&#x27;s performance was positively received, earning him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Kapoor came up with a decent performance in the moderate critical and commercial success &quot;Gharwali Baharwali&quot; (1998), opposite Raveena Tandon and Rambha.

After a few box-office failures, he had successes with films like &quot;Loafer&quot; (1996), opposite Juhi Chawla. In &quot;Judaai&quot;, Kapoor&#x27;s depiction of a loving husband torn between his two wives was appreciated and the film fared well at the box-office. &quot;Deewana Mastana&quot; (1997), &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; (1999) and &quot;Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain&quot; (1999) were also box office hits, with &quot;Biwi No. 1&quot; earning him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Comedian. Kapoor&#x27;s unusual characterisation of a zealous, crooked musical superstar in &quot;Taal&quot; (1999) shocked both audience and critics alike, earning him rave reviews, in addition to his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He again won rave reviews for his performance in &quot;Virasat&quot; (1997), a remake of the Tamil film, &quot;Thevar Magan&quot; (1992), in which he played Kamal Haasan&#x27;s role. The film proved to be a major box office success, and earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics), in addition to his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He also starred in the unsuccessful &quot;Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate&quot;, which was filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s last directorial, along with Juhi Chawla. He shaved his moustache once again for the second half of the film.

=== 2000s: Supporting roles and career expansion===

Anil Kapoor&#x27;s first release of 2000 was &quot;Bulandi&quot;, in which he played a double role, showing restraint and maturity as the elder Thakur. He won his first National Film Award for Best Actor, in addition to his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Pukar&quot; (2000). Kapoor again achieved critical and commercial success with &quot;Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai&quot; (2000). Kapoor performed as Rajeev in the much delayed &quot;Karobaar&quot; (2000), a film directed by Rakesh Roshan, where Kapoor&#x27;s dialogue delivery was appreciated. He delivered a powerhouse performance in Shanker&#x27;s &quot;Nayak&quot; (2001), which is considered to be his career-best performances.

In 2002, Kapoor performed in the role of a fat man in &quot;Badhaai Ho Badhaai&quot;, a takeoff from the Hollywood hit, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. He performed in the Indra Kumar directed film &quot;Rishtey&quot;. In &quot;Om Jai Jagadish&quot;, he gave an amazing performance. Kapoor shared the screen with Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan for the first time in &quot;Armaan&quot;, and played the character of a neurosurgeon. 

In his 2003 release, &quot;Calcutta Mail&quot;, according to PlanetBollywood.com, he delivered &quot;one of his best performances. His character was defined with ample scope to perform in this screenplay-driven performance and in spite of the strong supporting cast, this really came out as Kapoor&#x27;s one-man show.&quot; According to Bollywood Hungama, he &quot;ignited the silver screen with an authoritative performance&quot; in &quot;Musafir&quot; alongside Sameera Reddy, Aditya Pancholi, Sanjay Dutt and Koena Mitra. Kapoor performed as the stricken husband in the thriller &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Murder&quot;, which he also produced. Anees Bazmee&#x27;s super-hit comedy &quot;No Entry&quot; (2005), followed for Kapoor that year. The film went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year, earning him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Comedian. He was also in the film &quot;Bewafaa&quot;, playing a rich businessman who is forced to marry the sister of his wife after she passes away in childbirth.

Kapoor played a grey character in the 2005 thriller, &quot;Chocolate&quot;. Anil&#x27;s first release of 2007 &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love&quot; was a box office hit in overseas though a flop in India. Anees Bazmee&#x27;s &quot;Welcome&quot;, which released on 21 December 2007 was declared the biggest success of the year, earning him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Kapoor&#x27;s understated performance in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was highly lauded. His first release in 2008, Abbas Mustan&#x27;s thriller, &quot;Race&quot; became a box-office hit. Vijay Krishna Acharya&#x27;s &quot;Tashan&quot; marked Anil&#x27;s comeback to Yash Raj Films, but failed to do well at the box-office.

His first English language film, &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, which was released on 12 November 2008. &quot;Yuvvraaj&quot; was released on 21 November 2008. &quot;Yuvvraaj&quot;, with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, failed to do well at the box-office. On the other hand, &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; has won a number of international awards and received rave reviews from critics, costing only US$15 million to produce, but pulling in more than $352 million worldwide. In January 2009, he attended the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony along with the team of &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, which won four Golden Globe Awards. Kapoor demonstrated his well-known enthusiasm after &quot;Slumdog&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture (one of eight awards). He also received a nomination for Best Ensemble at the Black Reel Awards of 2008 and has won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

=== 2010s-present: Established actor ===

In 2010, Kapoor starred in the eighth season of the American television series &quot;24&quot;, portraying Omar Hassan, President of the fictional Islamic Republic of Kamistan. In October of that year he was cast to play a villain in both &quot;&quot; (released in December 2011) and &quot;Power&quot;. &quot;Power&quot; was to be directed by Rajkumar Santoshi but was shelved due to unknown reasons.

Anil Kapoor&#x27;s only release of 2012 Tezz earned him favourable reviews from critics; Taran Adarsh wrote that &quot;...it&#x27;s a treat watching Anil Kapoor on screen. Though the actor has been an integral part of so many movies in the past, you can never accuse him of repeating himself. Besides, he may be in his early 50s, but that hasn&#x27;t deterred Anil from performing the high-octane action stunts with flourish.&quot;

His performance in &quot;Shootout at Wadala&quot; was highly acclaimed by critics; Sudhish Kamath of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote that &quot;Anil Kapoor is first-rate, revelling in a tailor-made role as a no-nonsense cop, reminding us of the superstar he used to be in the Eighties.&quot; In January 2013 Kapoor became the first Indian actor to be invited for a special segment; &quot;In conversation&quot;, at the Toronto International Film Festival, an honour which is reserved for actors having considerable body of work. Beginning in 2013, he starred in the lead role of Jai Singh Rathod in the Indian remade series of &quot;24&quot;.

In 2015, he starred alongside an ensemble cast of Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar in Zoya Akhtar&#x27;s family comedy-drama &quot;Dil Dhadakne Do&quot;, which proved to be a commercial success and received positive reviews, earning Kapoor his third Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In September 2015, Kapoor made an appearance as himself in an ad for the &quot;Angry Birds Friends&quot; tournament Champions for Earth. Amazon cast Kapoor in its pilot &quot;The Book of Strange New Things&quot;, to play the role of Vikram Danesh, the authoritative head of the base on Oasis. Kapoor reprised his role of Majnu Bhai in the crime comedy &quot;Welcome Back&quot; (2015), the sequel to &quot;Welcome&quot; (2007). Featuring an ensemble cast that included reprising actor Nana Patekar and new additions John Abraham and Shruti Hassan among others. It opened to mixed reception but emerged as another success.

In 2017, he starred with his nephew, Arjun Kapoor, in Anees Bazmee directed romantic comedy &quot;Mubarakan&quot;. Kapoor played dual roles, one of which was a turbaned Sikh. The following year, he appeared in &quot;Race 3&quot; (2018), the third instalment in &quot;Race franchise&quot;. Although Kapoor was in the first film, his &quot;Race 3&quot; character was new to the series. The film was moderately successful despite generally negative reception. In the same year, Kapoor portrayed the titular character in &quot;Fanney Khan&quot;, a remake of Belgian film &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Famous!&quot; (2000). Alternatively, he voiced Baloo for the Hindi dub version of (2018).

2019 was a busy year for Kapoor as he played supporting roles in the coming-of-age romantic dramedy &quot;Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga&quot;, adventure comedy &quot;Total Dhamaal&quot;, sports drama &quot;The Zoya Factor&quot;, and starred in the action comedy &quot;Pagalpanti&quot;. In &quot;Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga&quot; and &quot;The Zoya Factor&quot;, he worked alongside his daughter Sonam Kapoor, with the former&#x27;s screenplay being selected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its library&#x27;s core collection, due to its concept of female homosexuality. On the other hand, &quot;Total Dhamaal&quot; became a hit.

Kapoor kicked off the decade alongside Aditya Roy Kapur in the prison thriller &quot;Malang&quot; (2020). Kapoor played a released convict and was praised for his performance. Malang became a commercial success. He next played a fictional version of himself in black comedy AK vs AK, alongside Anurag Kashyap. The names &quot;AK&quot; in the title are the initials of the two leads. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, the film was released on Netflix to positive reviews, with Kapoor&#x27;s performance receiving particular praise as one of the best of his career. This also marked Kapoor&#x27;s first time working with his son Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor.

In 2022, Kapoor starred with Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor in the western thriller &quot;Thar&quot;, produced by Netflix. His portrayal of a 1980s police inspector, earned high praise despite mixed reviews for the film, earned him the Filmfare OTT Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Web Original Film. In June 2022, he played a hedonistic, unfaithful husband and irresponsible father in the family dramedy &quot;Jugjugg Jeeyo&quot;. Tushar Joshi of &quot;India Today&quot; called him the film&#x27;s standout performer, while Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; deemed him &quot;flawless,&quot; noting his skilful balancing of dramatic highs and lows. This role earned him his record setting fourth Best Supporting Actor award at the 68th Filmfare Awards.

Kapoor co-produced and made a cameo in female sex comedy &quot;Thank You for Coming&quot; (2023), which premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in the Gala Presentations section, but turned out to be a financial failure. In the 2023 action film &quot;Animal&quot;, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Kapoor played a powerful industrialist and strict father to Ranbir Kapoor&#x27;s character. The controversial film became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time and Kapoor&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date, earning him another Filmfare Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

He then starred in Siddharth Anand&#x27;s &quot;Fighter&quot;, alongside Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone. The film fictionalises the 2019 military events between India and Pakistan, including the Pulwama attack, the Balakot airstrike, and the subsequent border skirmishes. It was a hit, topping overseas box office charts. He later starred in action thriller &quot;Savi&quot; (2024), also featuring Divya Khosla and Harshvardhan Rane. It was an adaptation of 2008 French film &quot;Anything for Her&quot;.

<doc id="1157585" wikidata="Q4896442" url="?curid=1157585" title="Washout (erosion)">
<text>A washout is the sudden erosion of soft soil or other support surfaces by a gush of water, usually occurring during a heavy downpour of rain (a flash flood) or other stream flooding. These downpours may occur locally in a thunderstorm or over a large area, such as following the landfall of a tropical cyclone. If a washout occurs in a crater-like formation, it is called a sinkhole, and it usually involves a leaking or broken water main or sewerage pipes. Other types of sinkholes, such as collapsed caves, are not washouts.

Widespread washouts can occur in mountainous areas after heavy rains, even in normally dry ravines. A severe washout can become a landslide, or cause a dam break in an earthen dam. Like other forms of erosion, most washouts can be prevented by vegetation whose roots hold the soil and/or slow the flow of surface and underground water. Deforestation increases the risk of washouts. Retaining walls and culverts may be used to try to prevent washouts, although particularly severe washouts may even destroy these if they are not large or strong enough.

==Effect on road and rail transport==
In road and rail transport, a washout is the result of a natural disaster where the roadbed is eroded away by flowing water, usually as the result of a flood. When a washout destroys a railroad&#x27;s right-of-way, the track is sometimes left suspended in midair across the newly formed gap, or it dips down into a ditch. This phenomenon is discussed in more detail under the term &quot;erosion&quot;. Bridges may collapse due to bridge scour around one or more bridge abutments or piers.

In 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances, and then Hurricane Ivan, caused a large number of washouts in western North Carolina and other parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, closing some roads for days and parts of the Blue Ridge Parkway for months. Other washouts have also caused train wrecks where tracks have been unknowingly undermined. Motorists have also driven into flooded streams at night, unaware of a new washout on the road in front of them until it is too late to brake, sometimes prompting a high-water rescue.

Major washouts can also ruin pipelines or undermine utility poles or underground lines, interrupting public utilities.

<text>Peter Charles Doherty (born 15 October 1940) is an Australian immunologist and Nobel laureate.

Doherty received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1995, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf M. Zinkernagel in 1996 and was named Australian of the Year in 1997. In the Australia Day Honours of 1997, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work with Zinkernagel. He is also a National Trust Australian Living Treasure. 

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Doherty&#x27;s immune system research was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic &quot;innovation and invention&quot;. In 2012, Doherty was appointed as an Honorary Professor in the School of Biochemistry and Immunology at Trinity College Dublin.

==Early life and education==
Peter Charles Doherty was born in the Brisbane suburb of Sherwood on 15 October 1940, to Eric Charles Doherty and Linda Doherty (née Byford). He grew up in Oxley, and attended Indooroopilly State High School (which now has a lecture theatre named after him).

After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in veterinary science in 1962 from the University of Queensland, he was a rural veterinary officer for the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock before taking up laboratory-based work at the Department&#x27;s Animal Research Institute. There he met microbiology graduate Penelope Stephens and they were married in 1965. Doherty received his master&#x27;s degree in veterinary science in 1966 from the University of Queensland. 
He obtained his PhD in pathology in 1970 from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, then returned to Australia to continue his research at the John Curtin School of Medical Research within the Australian National University in Canberra.

==Research and career==
Doherty&#x27;s research focused on the immune system and his Nobel Prize-winning work described how the body&#x27;s immune cells protect against viruses. He and Rolf Zinkernagel, the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, discovered how T cells recognise their target antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins.

Viruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell – not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.

==Awards and honours==
Doherty was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1987. In 1997, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He is the patron of the eponymous Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute), a joint venture between the University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health. It houses a group of infection and immunology experts, including Director Professor Sharon Lewin, who are charged with leading the battle against infectious diseases in humans. This became operational in 2014. He became an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2015. In the same year he was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences (FAHMS). In April 2017 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Victoria (FRSV).

John Monash Science School, Moreton Bay Boys College, and Murrumba State Secondary College each have a house named after him.

==Personal life==
, Peter Doherty and his wife Penny live in Melbourne. They have two sons, Michael, a neurologist working in the United States, and James, a Melbourne-based barrister, and six grandchildren. He gained a renewed level of fame in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when he accidentally tweeted the phrase &#x27;Dan Murphy opening hours&#x27; instead of performing a web search for it.

Doherty currently spends three months of the year conducting research at St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where he is a faculty member at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center through the College of Medicine. For the other 9 months of the year, he works in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Melbourne, Victoria.

<text>Tropic of Capricorn is a semi-autobiographical novel by Henry Miller, first published by Obelisk Press in Paris in 1939. A prequel of sorts to Miller&#x27;s first published novel, 1934&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, it was banned in the United States until a 1961 Justice Department ruling declared that its contents were not obscene.

==History==
===Writing===
During a three-week vacation from Western Union in 1922, Miller wrote his first novel, &quot;Clipped Wings&quot;, a study of 12 Western Union messengers. It has never been published; only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in later works, including in the brief portraits of Western Union messengers in &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;.

In the spring of 1927, Miller was living in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights with his second wife June Miller and her lover, Jean Kronski. He had recently obtained a new job working for the Parks Department. One day, he returned home to find a note saying they had taken a boat to Paris. Soon after, Miller moved back in with his parents in Brooklyn. One night in May 1927, Miller stayed at the Parks Department office after work and typed up a 32-page document he called &quot;June&quot;, outlining the details of their relationship. He would use the document as source material for &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; as well as &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot; trilogy. Miller would also repurpose numerous scenes into &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; from his unpublished third novel &quot;Lucky Lesbians&quot; (later retitled &quot;Crazy Cock&quot;), which he worked on from 1928 to 1930 and which was ultimately published in 1991 (over a decade after his death).

Miller began writing &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; in earnest toward the end of 1933 while living in Paris. At the time, he was also writing &quot;Black Spring&quot;, and putting the finishing touches on &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. Early on, he referred to &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; as &quot;the June book.&quot; His biographer Robert Ferguson called the book Miller&#x27;s attempt at &quot;retrieving in written form as much as possible of the disappearing past.&quot; Although referred to as &quot;the June book,&quot; his second wife is more of an influence than a primary character, making only a short appearance. The book is dedicated &quot;To Her,&quot; in reference to June.

===Publication===
&quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; was published in France, in English, by Obelisk Press in February 1939. A French translation appeared as &quot;Tropique du Capricorne&quot; in April 1946. Sales of the book, along with &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, were boosted by the controversy surrounding their censorship, with complaints against Miller and his publisher on charges of pornography. In the 1940s and 1950s, Miller&#x27;s books were hard to find and expensive. The banned books were occasionally smuggled into the US, although they were often seized by Customs. In 1944, accompanied by his soon-to-be third wife Janina Martha Lepska, Miller read excerpts from &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; and &quot;Black Spring&quot; at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.

&quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; was banned in the United States until a 1961 Justice Department ruling declared that its contents were not obscene. After Grove Press published the novel in the US in September 1962, Miller gained a new, younger generation of readers for his work, which coincided with the sexual revolution of the 1960s. He was seen by many as a champion of the new sexual freedom, and was endorsed by well-known literary figures of the time, including Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac.

==Plot==
The novel covers Miller&#x27;s growing inability and outright refusal to accommodate what he sees as America&#x27;s hostile environment. It is autobiographical but not chronological, jumping between Miller&#x27;s adolescent adventures in Brooklyn in the 1900s, recollections of his first love Una Gifford, a love affair with his nearly 30-year-old piano teacher when he was 15, his unhappy marriage to his first wife Beatrice, his years working at Western Union (called The Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company in the book) in Manhattan in the 1920s, and his fateful meeting with his second wife June (known in the book as Mara), whom he credits with changing his life and making him into a writer. 

&quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot; continues the story of June in greater detail, over the course of nearly 1,500 pages. It describes the process of Miller finding his voice as a writer, until eventually he sets off for Paris, where the activities depicted in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; begin.

<text>A rake (Old English &quot;raca&quot;, cognate with Dutch &quot;hark&quot;, German &quot;Rechen&quot;, from the root meaning &quot;to scrape together&quot;, &quot;heap up&quot;) is a broom for outside use; a horticultural implement consisting of a toothed bar fixed transversely to a handle, or tines fixed to a handle, and used to collect leaves, hay, grass, etc., and in gardening, for loosening the soil, light weeding and levelling, removing dead grass from lawns, and generally for purposes performed in agriculture by the harrow.

Large mechanized versions of rakes are used in farming, called hay rakes, are built in many different forms (e.g. star-wheel rakes, rotary rakes, etc.). Nonmechanized farming may be done with various forms of a hand rake.

== Types ==
Modern hand-rakes usually have steel, plastic, or bamboo teeth or tines, though historically they have been made with wood or iron. The handle is typically a ~ haft made of wood, bamboo, steel or fiberglass. Plastic rakes are generally lighter weight and lower cost. Because they can be fabricated in widths of greater dimensions they are more suitable for leaves which have recently been deposited. Metal tined rakes are better suited for spring raking when the debris is often wet or rotted and can best be collected when the metal tines penetrate to the thatch layer.

Leaf rakes are used to gather leaves, cut grass and debris, have long, flat teeth bent into an L-shape and fanned out from the point of attachment. This permits some flexibility to allow the teeth to conform to terrain, while also being light to minimize damage to vegetation. Compact, telescoping leaf rakes allow the teeth to be withdrawn by sliding a movable fixture point up the shaft.

Garden rakes typically have steel teeth and are intended for heavier use in soil and larger debris. They have long, stiff teeth which must be able to withstand abrasion and bending forces. 

Bow rakes are a subset of garden rakes which separate the handle and bar with a bow-shaped extension which allows the flat back of the bar to be used for levelling and scraping. These may have somewhat finer and shorter teeth and can perform a myriad of gardening and landscape tasks, and due to their more costly construction are likely to be a professional tool. Alternatively, a second set of differently shaped teeth may be added to the back of the bar.

A landscaping rake resembles an oversized garden rake, with a longer head. A landscaping rake serves the purpose of smoothing and grading extensive soil areas or earth areas. It distinguishes itself from traditional leaf rakes or soil clod breakers due to its substantial width. Typically, a landscaping rake boasts a head measuring 30 to 38 inches or even broader, featuring steel tines set at a 90-degree angle to the handle.

A stone rake is similar to a landscape rake, but with a narrower head of about 18 to 28 inches and is constructed from steel or aluminum. The head sits at a 90-degree angle to the handle. 

A thatch rake&#x27;s primary function is to eliminate thatch—an organic layer situated between the lawn and the soil surface. Diverging from the typical structure of rakes, a thatch rake is equipped with sharp blades on both sides of its head. One side effectively breaks up the thatch, while the other side facilitates its removal. When left unaddressed, a dense thatch layer can impede the penetration of air and sunlight to the base of grass blades, potentially leading to lawn diseases. The removal of a substantial thatch layer, particularly if it measures 1/4-inch thick or thicker, proves beneficial for enhancing the overall health and vitality of the lawn. A reliable thatch rake stands out as an indispensable tool for effectively performing this task. 
A heavy rake is for conditioning and dethatching soil as well as moving larger pieces of debris. Most weeds have weaker and shallower roots than grass and thus dethatching along with (afterward) necessary sunlight, fertilizer and seed, and if later necessary any remedial chemicals, makes for a good crop of grass. Larger tools (or lawnmower attachments) are more often used for large areas of de-thatching or soil preparation.

A concrete rake is a heavy-duty tool with a flat edge for spreading and smoothing wet concrete and a curved side for scooping. Made of durable materials, it is essential for leveling concrete surfaces in construction. 

A roof rake features a long handle and a flat, scoop-like head for removing debris or snow from rooftops, preventing gutter clogs and structural damage, especially in snowy regions. 

Berry-picking rakes are tools for collecting berries.

Fire rakes, a heavy-duty variant of the normal rake, are used for fire prevention.

==Cultural associations==
If a rake lies in the ground with the teeth facing upwards, as shown on the top picture, and someone accidentally steps on the teeth, the rake&#x27;s handle can swing rapidly upwards, colliding with the victim&#x27;s face. This is often seen in slapstick comedy and cartoons, such as &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, wherein a series of rakes become what Sideshow Bob describes as his &quot;arch-nemesis&quot;.

There is a Russian saying &quot;to step on the same rake&quot; (), which means &quot;to repeat the same silly mistake&quot;, also the word &quot;rake&quot; () in Russian slang means &quot;troubles&quot;.

In the 16th century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the major character Zhu Bajie wields a rake, his &quot;Nine-toothed rake&quot; (Jiǔchǐdīngpá), as his signatory weapon.

In Japanese folklore, the &quot;Kumade&quot; (熊手, lit. &#x27;bear hand&#x27;) is a rake; a smaller, handheld, decorated version is sold as an &quot;engimono&quot;, often during &quot;Tori-no-Ichi&quot; (lit. &quot;Rooster markets) which take place throughout Japan each November, and is believed to be able to, literally, rake-in good-fortune &amp;/or rake-out bad-fortune for the user.

<doc id="1157602" wikidata="Q5728668" url="?curid=1157602" title="Henry Stapp">
<text>Henry Pierce Stapp (born March 23, 1928, in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American mathematical physicist, known for his work in quantum mechanics, particularly the development of axiomatic S-matrix theory, the proofs of strong nonlocality properties, and the place of free will in the &quot;orthodox&quot; quantum mechanics of John von Neumann.

==Biography==

Stapp received his PhD in particle physics at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Nobel Laureates Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain.

In 1958, Stapp was invited by Wolfgang Pauli to ETH Zurich to work with him personally on basic problems in quantum mechanics. When Pauli died in December 1958, Stapp studied von Neumann&#x27;s book, and on the basis of that work composed an article entitled &quot;Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics&quot;, which was not submitted for publication; but the title became the title of his 1993 book.

In 1969 Stapp was invited by Werner Heisenberg to work with him at the Max Planck Institute in Munich.

In 1976 Stapp was invited by J.A. Wheeler to work with him on problems in the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Dr. Stapp has published many papers pertaining to the non-local aspects of quantum mechanics and Bell&#x27;s theorem, including 
three books published by Springer-Verlag.

Stapp has worked also in a number of conventional areas of high energy physics, including analysis of the scattering of polarized protons, parity violation, and S-matrix theory.

==Research==
Some of Stapp&#x27;s work concerns the implications of quantum mechanics (QM). He has argued for the relevance of QM to consciousness and free will.

Stapp favors the idea that quantum wave functions collapse only when they interact with consciousness as a consequence of &quot;orthodox&quot; quantum mechanics. He argues that quantum wave functions collapse when conscious minds select one among the alternative quantum possibilities. His hypothesis of how mind may interact with matter via quantum processes in the brain differs from that of Penrose and Hameroff. While they postulate quantum computing in the microtubules in brain neurons, Stapp postulates a more global collapse, a &#x27;mind like&#x27; wave-function collapse that exploits certain aspects of the quantum Zeno effect within the synapses. Stapp&#x27;s view of the neural correlate of attention is explained in his book, &quot;Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Participating Observer&quot; (2007). Stapp has claimed that consciousness is fundamental to the universe.

In this book he credits John von Neumann&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; (1955, 1932) with providing an &quot;orthodox&quot; quantum mechanics demonstrating mathematically the essential role of quantum physics in the mind. Stapp has taken interest in the work of Alfred North Whitehead. He has proposed what he calls a &quot;revised Whiteheadianism&quot;. He has also written a chapter &quot;Whiteheadian Process and Quantum Theory&quot; (pp. 92–102) in the book &quot;Physics and Whitehead: Quantum, Process, and Experience&quot; (2003).

His philosophy has been described as being influenced by both Heisenberg&#x27;s physical realism and Bohr&#x27;s idealism. A form of panpsychism Philosopher Gordon Globus noted that &quot;Stapp unhesitatingly descends into panexperientialism&quot;. Stapp has co-authored papers with Jeffrey M. Schwartz. Schwartz has connected the work of Stapp with the concept of &quot;mental force&quot; and spiritual practices of Buddhism.

==Reception==

Stapp&#x27;s work has drawn criticism from scientists such as David Bourget and Danko Georgiev. Recent papers and a book by Georgiev criticize Stapp&#x27;s model in two aspects: (1) The mind in Stapp&#x27;s model does not have its own wavefunction or density matrix, but nevertheless can act upon the brain using projection operators. Such usage is not compatible with standard quantum mechanics because one can attach any number of ghostly minds to any point in space that act upon physical quantum systems with any projection operators. Therefore, Stapp&#x27;s model does not build upon &quot;the prevailing principles of physics&quot;, but negates them. (2) Stapp&#x27;s claim that quantum Zeno effect is robust against environmental decoherence directly contradicts a basic theorem in quantum information theory according to which acting with projection operators upon the density matrix of a quantum system can never decrease the Von Neumann entropy of the system, but can only increase it.

<text>The North Kalimantan Communist Party (abbr. NKCP) was a Maoist communist party based in the Malaysian state of Sarawak in northern Borneo. It was formally founded on 19 September 1971. Before that, the group had been operating under the name Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas. The chairman of the NKCP was Wen Ming Chyuan and the party enjoyed close links with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The NKCP&#x27;s membership was predominantly ethnically Chinese. The two military formations of the NKCP were the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrilla Force (SPGF) or &quot;Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak&quot; (PGRS), and the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army (NKPA) or the &quot;Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara&quot; (PARAKU). The NKCP participated in the Sarawak Communist Insurgency (1962–1990). On 17 October 1990, the North Kalimantan Communist Party signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak state government, formally ending the Sarawak Communist Insurgency.

== Name ==
The organisation was initially referred to by its members as the Sarawak Communist Movement and subsequently the North Kalimantan Communist Party after 1970. Documents published by the Sarawak colonial and Malaysian governments tended to label any anti-colonial group operating in Sarawak as either the Sarawak Communist Organisation (SCO) or the Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO). Due to the Cold War atmosphere, anti-colonial groups and left-leaning individuals were often categorised as Communists by the authorities. According to the Japanese academic Fujio Hara, the NKCP&#x27;s two main military formations were the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrilla Force (SPGF) or &quot;Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak&quot; (PGRS), and the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army (NKPA) or the &quot;Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara&quot; (PARAKU). The SPGF operated in western Sarawak while the NKPA operated in eastern Sarawak. In addition, the main component organisations were the Sarawak Liberation League (SLL), the Sarawak Advance Youths&#x27; Association (SAYA), and the NKPA.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
According to Hong-Kah Fong, the North Kalimantan Communist Party was officially formed on 30 March 1970. However, 19 September 1971 was selected as the official commemoration date in order to commemorate the Pontianak Conference of 17–19 September 1965, which is regarded as the birth date of the Sarawak Communist Movement. The NKCP traces its origins to local Chinese Communists who had migrated from China to Sabah during the 1930s and 1940s. The NKCP was also preceded by several Communist movements including the Races Liberation Front and the Borneo Anti-Japanese League (which consisted of two organisations: the North Borneo Anti Japanese League and the West Borneo Anti-Japanese League), which had resisted the Japanese occupation during World War II.

During the post-war period, other communist groups active in Sarawak included the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Liberation League, and the Sarawak Advanced Youths&#x27; Association (SAYA). By 1965, these had coalesced into two main organisations: the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara&quot;, PARAKU) and the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas (&quot;Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak&quot;, PGRS). These were collectively referred to by most British and Western sources as the Sarawak Communist Movement or Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO), which came into existence during the Pontianak Conference in September 1965.

According to the historians Vernon L. Porritt and Cheah Boon Kheng, Communist elements were also influential in the Chinese schools during the 1940s. Following the Second World War, Communist elements also infiltrated the Sarawak labour movement and Sarawak&#x27;s first political party, the predominantly ethnic Chinese Sarawak United People&#x27;s Party, which was formed in June 1959. In addition, leftist study groups were formed in Kuching between 1949 and 1950. Two important figures in the Sarawak Communist movement, Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok, came from Chung Hua Middle School. On 30 March 1954, pro-Communist students at Kuching Chung Hua Middle School organised a 47-day strike to protest against the school administration&#x27;s teaching methods and its expulsion of students. Communist elements later spread to the business and farming community, many of whom were parents of these left-wing students.

=== Opposition to Malaysia ===
The Sarawak Communist Movement was also opposed to the formation of Malaysia, a new political federation which had been created by the British to merge their former Southeast Asian territories of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, and British North Borneo. Instead, the Sarawak Communists supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British control to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. This idea had originally proposed by A. M. Azahari, leader of the Parti Rakyat Brunei (Brunei People&#x27;s Party), who had forged links with Sukarno&#x27;s nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected to peninsular political domination.
According to a British government white paper known as &quot;The Communist Threat to Sarawak&quot;, the so-called &quot;Clandestine Communist Organisation&quot; had infiltrated the Chinese-language media, trade unions, and had taken over the SUPP. Following the defeat of the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the British authorities in British Borneo, in cooperation with the Malaysian Special Branch, launched a crackdown of suspected Communists which prompted 700–800 Chinese youths to flee to Indonesian Kalimantan. These guerrillas would form the core of the North Kalimantan Communist Party&#x27;s two guerrilla formations: the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas (Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak, PGRS) and the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army (Pasakan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara, PARAKU).
The Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrilla Force was formed on 30 March 1964 at Gunung Asuansang in West Kalimantan with the assistance of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The PGRS&#x27;s leaders included Bong Kee Chok, Yang Chu Chung, and Wen Ming Chyuan. According to Conboy, the PGRS numbered about 800 and was based in West Kalimantan at Batu Hitam, with a contingent of 120 from the Indonesian intelligence agency and a small cadre trained in China. The Indonesian Communist Party was also present and was led by an ethnic Arab revolutionary, Sofyan. The PGRS ran some raids into Sarawak but spent more time developing their supporters in Sarawak. The Indonesian armed forces did not approve of the leftist nature of the PGRS and generally avoided them.

According to the former British soldier and writer Will Fowler, these Sarawak Communists received military-style training at Indonesian camps. At that time, President Sukarno was pro-Communist and anti-Western. As with Sukarno and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), the Sarawak Communists opposed the newly formed Federation of Malaysia as a &quot;neo-colonialist conspiracy&quot; and supported the unification of all former British territories in Borneo to create an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. In addition, the Sarawak Communists had plans to launch attacks on police stations and to ambush security forces, paralleling similar tactics used by the Malayan National Liberation Army during the Malayan Emergency.

Meanwhile, the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army was formed by Bong Kee Chok near Sungai Melawi in West Kalimantan with the assistance of the PKI on 26 October 1965. While the SPGF under its commander Yang operated in western Sarawak, the NKPA operated in eastern Sarawak. The NKPA was initially commanded by Lam Wah Kwai, who was succeeded by Bong Kee Chok. According to Kenneth Conboy, Soebandrio met with a group of Sarawak Communist leaders in Bogor, and Nasution sent three trainers from Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat (RPKAD) Battalion 2 to Nangabadan near the Sarawak border, where there were about 300 trainees. Some three months later, two lieutenants were also sent there.

The Indonesians had planned to use the Sarawak Communists as an indigenous front for their operations during the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation. To support this ruse, they even formed a separate organisation named the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU), to link the Sarawak Communists to the original Bruneian rebels. While the first raids included SCO members, they were often led by regular Indonesian officers or Non-commissioned officers from the Marine commandos (&quot;Korps Komando Operasi&quot;, KKO), the Army para-commandos (&quot;Regimen Para Kommando Angaton Darat&quot;, RPKAD), and the Air Force paratroopers (&quot; Pasukan Gerak Tjepat&quot;, PGT). 
Following the 1965 failed coup, and subsequently, the military takeover in Indonesia, General Suharto launched a purge of Communist elements. Overnight, the Sarawak Communists in Indonesia lost a safe haven and the Indonesian military would subsequently cooperate with the Malaysians in counter-insurgency operations against their former allies. Despite the loss of an important ally, PARAKU and the PGRS continued fighting against the Malaysian government during the Sarawak Communist Insurgency which lasted until November 1990.

=== Decline and fragmentation ===
Between 1965 and 1990, there were skirmishes which pitted the Sarawak Communist Movement against the Malaysian armed forces. In response to the Communist insurgency, the Malaysian federal government created several &quot;controlled areas&quot; along the Kuching–Serian road in Sarawak&#x27;s First and Third Divisions in 1965. These settlements were protected by barbed wire and modelled after the successful New Villages used earlier during the Malayan Emergency. As with the Briggs Plan, the &quot;controlled areas&quot; succeeded in denying the SCO access to food supplies and material from their Chinese and Dayak supporters. Following the 13 May Incident in 1969, all Communist elements were expelled from the SUPP and moderate elements gained control over the party. The SUPP then entered into a coalition with the ruling Bumiputera Party in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly.

On 30 March 1970, Wen Ming Chyuan, the Head of the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas in Sarawak&#x27;s First Division, formed the North Kalimantan Communist Party. However, 19 September 1971 was chosen as the official date of the formation of the party to coincide with the Pontianak Conference, which had been held on 17–19 September 1965. While the Pontianak Conference was regarded as the foundation of the Sarawak Communist Movement, none of the conference attendees were Communist. Instead, they consisted of members of the left-wing Liberation League and the &quot;O Members&quot; of the Advanced Youths Association. While they had discussed creating a Communist party in Sarawak, they delayed doing so until 1971 due to the tense political situation in Indonesia.

The Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya&#x27;kub also made several overtures to the NKCP insurgents and managed to convince several of the insurgents to lay down their arms. In 1973–74, the Malaysian government scored a key victory when Rahman Ya&#x27;kub successfully convinced Bong Kee Chok, the Director and Commissar of the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sarawak government. Following this event, between 481 and 580 members of the North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army and the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas surrendered and returned to society. This was a heavy loss for the Sarawak Communist Movement since this number comprised approximately 75 per cent of its entire force in Sarawak. After this defection, only 121 guerrilla fighters led by Hung Chu Ting and Wong Lian Kui remained. By 1974, the Communist insurgency had become confined to the Rejang Delta. Both sides sustained casualties and many civilians were also killed and wounded in the cross-fire.

Following the successful Hat Yai peace accords between the Malayan Communist Party and the Malaysian government in 1989, the remaining North Kalimantan Communist Party guerrillas decided to end their insurgency after one of their Chinese contacts Weng Min Chyuan convinced them to negotiate with the Sarawak state government. In July 1990, a series of negotiations between the NKCP and the Sarawak government took place at the town of Bintulu. By 17 October 1990, a peace agreement formally ending the Sarawak communist insurgency was ratified at Wisma Bapa Malaysia in the state capital Kuching. Shortly afterwards, the last remaining NKCP operatives led by Ang Cho Teng surrendered. These developments ended the Sarawak Communist insurgency.

<text>The Princess Irene Fusiliers Guards Regiment () is a regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army, named after Princess Irene, the Granddaughter of Queen Wilhelmina, daughter of Queen Juliana, sister of Princess Beatrix and aunt of King Willem-Alexander. It is one of two regiments, along with the Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers, to be classed as &#x27;Guards&#x27;.

==Regimental History==
A group of Dutch soldiers were forced to withdraw in May 1940 after the unexpected invasion of the Netherlands by the Nazi armies. Faced by the choice: to surrender or to continue the fight alongside the Western Allies, they opted for the latter. Via several ways they finally arrived in Great Britain, where they formed a new unit: the Royal Dutch Brigade. The unit was later renamed to become the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade. In August 1941 this unit received from the hands of the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina, who remained in exile in England, its own regimental colors. In addition the unit was given the honorary name of &#x27;Princess Irene&#x27;, named after the Queen&#x27;s second granddaughter. This name is also symbolic, as the name of Irene means: &#x27;she who brings peace&#x27; (in Greek). As a small detachment in the British Liberation Army (the unit only numbered approximately 1400 men) the Brigade took part in the campaign in Western Europe. In May 1945 the Nazis capitulated in the Netherlands which also led to the disbanding of the Irene Brigade, which to a large extent was made up of war volunteers and conscripts. To remember their special bond, the men of &#x27;the first hour&#x27; proudly wore their special distinction: an orange-blue lanyard called &#x27;invasion-lanyard&#x27;. The regimental colors of the Royal Dutch Brigade &#x27;Princess Irene&#x27; were decorated with the highest military order for valor known in the Dutch Army. So as not to let the name of that small Dutch unit fade into history, it was decided that the traditions surrounding the regimental colors were to be continued by a new regiment - the Princess Irene Regiment which was formed in April 1946 on the basis of the brigade.

Five battalions of the new regiment were on active duty during the so-called &#x27;police actions&#x27; in the years 1946-1949 in the former Netherlands East Indies, or today&#x27;s Indonesia. Ninety young Dutch &#x27;Irene&#x27; soldiers were killed during these operations against Indonesian regulars and militias.

The Regiment Princess Irene became Guards Regiment Fusiliers Princess Irene in 1948. The traditions of the regiment were carried on by 13th Armored Infantry Battalion of the Royal Dutch Army in the Westenbergbarracks in Schalkhaar (near Deventer). In June 1992 the 17th Armored Infantry Battalion took over the traditions. Since then, the regimental colors, monument and museum are settled in the General-major De Ruyter van Steveninckbarracks named after the commander of the Irene Brigade ) in Oirschot. 17th Armored Infantry Battalion Guards Regiment Fusiliers Princess Irene is part of 13 Motorized Brigade.

In June - December 1996 the battalion was transferred to Bosnia (former Yugoslavia). As 17 (NL) Mechanized Battalion Guards Regiment Princess Irene they served in the IFOR-II operation under British command, just as the Irene Brigade 50 years before them. In Bosnia the men and women of the battalion wore the invasion-lanyard of the former Irene Brigade on active duty. It was handed over to them by veterans of the brigade to illustrate the bond with their young colleagues. This was only the beginning of the peacekeeping operations for the Fusiliers. They went to Bosnia again in December - June 1999 as part of the SFOR5 force. June - December 1999 13 Fusiliers stayed on Cyprus, with UNICYP3. A Fusiliers company served in Kosovo (Jan - May 2000) with KFOR2. In December 2002 17 (NL) Mechanized Battalion Guards Regiment Princess Irene will stay in Bosnia for the 3rd time as part of SFOR13. Further missions were Iraq 2004 and 2005 and Afghanistan 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2016.

==Ceremonial uniform==
When the regiment was promoted to the status of guards in 1948, they adopted a ceremonial uniform. To commemorate the unit&#x27;s foundation in the United Kingdom, it was decided to adopt the style of the traditional British &quot;full dress&quot; infantry uniform, with a scarlet tunic and the dark blue &quot;Home Service&quot; helmet, which is also used by the Netherlands Marine Corps. The five-pointed star-shaped helmet badge commemorates the star used as a recognition emblem by the Allied forces in the North-West Europe Campaign of 1944–1945. The buttons of the tunic carry the Netherlands lion in relief. Only the upper button on cuff flaps carry the lion though the middle button has two crossed cannon barrels and the lower an antique helmet. They symbolize the infantry, artillery and engineers of the original unit.
The lace on the collar signifies a Netherlands guards unit, while the cuffs are modeled on those worn by the British Guards Division. The retaining cord is a sign of commissioned rank and an indication of rank in the Netherlands army, additionally the sash is edged in gold to contrast with the tunic.

<text>Edmund Emil Kemper III (born December 18, 1948) is an American serial killer convicted of murdering seven women and one girl between May 1972 and April 1973. Years earlier, at the age of 15, Kemper had murdered his paternal grandparents. Kemper was nicknamed the &quot;Co-ed Killer&quot;, as most of his non-familial victims were female college students hitchhiking in the vicinity of Santa Cruz County, California. Most of his murders included necrophilia, decapitation, and dismemberment.

Found sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, Kemper requested the death penalty for his crimes. Capital punishment was suspended in California at the time, and he instead received eight concurrent life sentences. Since then, he has been incarcerated at California Medical Facility in Vacaville.

==Early life==
Edmund Emil Kemper III was born in Burbank, California, on December 18, 1948. He was the middle child of three children and the only son born to Clarnell Elizabeth Kemper (née Stage, 1921–1973), a native of Montana, and Edmund Emil Kemper Jr. (1919–1985). Edmund Jr. was a World War II veteran who, after the war, tested nuclear weapons at the Pacific Proving Grounds before returning to California, where he worked as an electrician. Clarnell often complained about her husband&#x27;s &quot;menial&quot; electrician job. Edmund Jr. later stated that &quot;suicide missions in wartime and the atomic bomb testings were nothing compared to living with [Clarnell]&quot; and that she affected him &quot;more than three hundred and ninety-six days and nights of fighting on the front did.&quot;

Weighing as a newborn, Kemper was a head taller than his peers by the age of four. Early on, he exhibited antisocial behavior such as cruelty to animals; at the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive, then dug it up, decapitated it, and mounted its head on a spike. Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat. At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (b. 1951), over him; he kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them.

Kemper was known to harbor dark fantasies and have a morbid imagination. In his youth, Kemper performed rites with his younger sister&#x27;s dolls that culminated in his removing their heads and hands. On one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied, &quot;If I kiss her, I&#x27;d have to kill her first.&quot; Kemper recalled that as a young boy, he would sneak out of his house armed with his father&#x27;s bayonet and go to his second-grade teacher&#x27;s house to watch her through the windows. Kemper also stated in interviews in his later life that some of his favorite games to play as a child were &quot;Gas Chamber&quot; and &quot;Electric Chair&quot;, in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up and flip an imaginary switch; he would then tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending that he was being executed by gas inhalation or electric shock. Kemper also came close to death several times as a child. Once, his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train. Another time, she pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where Kemper almost drowned.

Kemper had a close relationship with his father, and was notably devastated when his parents separated in 1957 and divorced in 1961. He was sent to live with his mother Clarnell in Helena, Montana. Kemper had a severely dysfunctional relationship with his mother, a neurotic, domineering alcoholic who frequently belittled, humiliated, and beat him with a belt. Clarnell often made her son sleep in a locked basement because she feared that he would harm his sisters, regularly mocked him for his large size — he stood by the age of 15 — and derided him as &quot;a real weirdo&quot; in a phone conversation to Kemper&#x27;s father, unaware that her son had been eavesdropping. She also refused to show Kemper affection out of fear that she would &quot;turn him gay&quot; and told the young Kemper that he reminded her of his father and that no woman would ever love him. Kemper later described her as a &quot;sick, angry woman,&quot; and it has been postulated that she had borderline personality disorder.

At the age of 14, Kemper ran away from home in an attempt to reconcile with his father in Van Nuys, California. Once there, Kemper learned that his father had remarried and now had a stepson. Kemper stayed with his father for a short while until the elder Kemper sent him to live with his paternal grandparents, who lived on a ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada on Road 224, about two miles west of the town of North Fork. Kemper hated living in North Fork; he described his grandfather as &quot;senile&quot; and said that his grandmother &quot;was constantly emasculating me and my grandfather.&quot;

==First murders==

On August 27, 1964, at the age of 15, Kemper killed his grandmother Maude Matilda (Hughey) Kemper (1897–1964) with a rifle after an argument, shooting her once in the head and twice in the back, then stabbing her several times. When Kemper&#x27;s grandfather Edmund Emil Kemper Sr. (1892–1964) came home, Kemper fatally shot him in the driveway. Kemper phoned his mother, who told him to call police. Kemper did so and waited for police to arrive.

Kemper told police that he &quot;just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma&quot;, and later said he killed his grandfather because he would be angry with Kemper. Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper during adulthood, wrote, &quot;In his way, he had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother.&quot; Kemper&#x27;s crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. He was sent to Atascadero State Hospital, a maximum-security facility in San Luis Obispo County that houses mentally ill convicts.

===Imprisonment (1964–1969)===
At Atascadero, California Youth Authority psychiatrists and social workers disagreed with the court psychiatrists&#x27; diagnoses. Their reports stated that Kemper showed &quot;no flight of ideas, no interference with thought, no expression of delusions or hallucinations, and no evidence of bizarre thinking.&quot; They also observed him to be intelligent and introspective. Initial testing measured his IQ at 136, more than two standard deviations above average. Kemper was re-diagnosed with a less severe condition, a &quot;personality trait disturbance, passive-aggressive type.&quot; Later during his stay at Atascadero, he was given another IQ test, which produced a higher result of 145.

Kemper endeared himself to his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and he was trained to administer psychiatric tests to other inmates. A psychiatrist later said, &quot;He was a very good worker[,] and this is not typical of a sociopath. He really took pride in his work.&quot; Kemper also became a member of the Jaycees while in Atascadero and claimed to have developed &quot;some new tests and some new scales on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,&quot; specifically an &quot;Overt Hostility Scale&quot;, during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists. After his second arrest, Kemper said that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, admitting that he learned a lot from the sex offenders to whom he administered tests.

==Release and time between murders==
On December 18, 1969, his 21st birthday, Kemper was released on parole from Atascadero. Against the recommendations of psychiatrists at the hospital, he was released into the care of his mother Clarnell—who, by this time, had remarried, taken the surname Strandberg, and divorced again. Clarnell then resided in Aptos, California, a short drive from where she worked as an administrative assistant at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). Kemper later demonstrated further to his psychiatrists that he was rehabilitated, and on November 29, 1972, his juvenile records were permanently expunged. The last report from his probation psychiatrists read:
While staying with his mother, Kemper attended community college in accordance with his parole requirements and had hoped to become a police officer, though he was rejected because of his size—at the time of his release from Atascadero, Kemper stood tall—which led to his nickname &quot;Big Ed.&quot; Kemper maintained relationships with Santa Cruz police officers despite his rejection from joining the force and became a self-described &quot;friendly nuisance&quot; at a bar called the Jury Room, a popular hangout for local cops.

Kemper worked a series of menial jobs before gaining employment with the State of California Division of Highways in 1971. During this time, his relationship with Clarnell remained toxic and hostile, the two having frequent arguments that their neighbors often overheard. Kemper later described the arguments he had with his mother around this time, stating the following:
When he had saved enough money, Kemper moved out to live with a friend in Alameda. There, he still complained of being unable to get away from his mother because she regularly phoned him and paid him surprise visits. He often had financial difficulties, which resulted in his frequently returning to his mother&#x27;s apartment in Aptos. Kemper, who was then in his early twenties, met a female student from Turlock High School at a Santa Cruz beach, and the two became engaged in March 1973. Their engagement lasted over a year before being broken off due to Kemper&#x27;s second arrest. Her parents requested her name not be revealed to the public; she was reportedly 17 and still attending high school at the time.

The same year that he began working for the Highway Division, Kemper was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle that he had recently purchased. His arm was badly injured in the crash, and he received a $15,000 () settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car&#x27;s driver. As he was driving around in the 1969 Ford Galaxie he bought with part of his settlement money, he noticed a large number of young women hitchhiking, and began storing plastic bags, knives, blankets and handcuffs in his car. He first picked up young women hitchhiking, then peacefully let them go; according to Kemper, he picked up around 150 hitchhikers who were in line with this pattern. This was before he felt homicidal sexual urges, which he called his &quot;little zapples,&quot; and which he later began acting on. At times, he blamed the women he killed for hitchhiking, which he said was &quot;flaunting in my face the fact that they could do any damn thing they wanted, and that society is as screwed up as it is.&quot;

==Later murders==
Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper killed eight people. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother, or strangle them. He would then take their bodies back to his home, where he decapitated them, performed irrumatio on their severed heads, had sexual intercourse with their corpses, and then dismembered them.

During this 11-month murder spree, Kemper killed five college students, one high school student, his mother, and his mother&#x27;s best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he often searched for victims after having arguments with his mother and that she refused to introduce him to women attending the university where she worked. He recalled: &quot;She would say, &#x27;You&#x27;re just like your father. You don&#x27;t deserve to get to know them&#x27;.&quot; Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target: his mother.

===Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Luchessa===
On May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in Berkeley when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking students from Fresno State University, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, with the pretense of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, with which he was familiar from his work at the Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. It was there that he handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, then stabbed and strangled Pesce to death, subsequently killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce, he &quot;brushed the back of [his] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [him]&quot;, adding that he said, &quot;&#x27;Whoops, I&#x27;m sorry&#x27; or something like that&quot; after grazing her breast, despite murdering her minutes later. He also noted that he chose the women because they seemed upper middle class, &quot;of a better class of people than the scroungy, messy, dirty, smelly, hippy types I wasn&#x27;t at all interested in.&quot;

Kemper put both of the women&#x27;s bodies in the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and returned to his apartment. He was stopped on the way by a police officer for having a broken taillight, but the officer did not detect the corpses in the car. Kemper&#x27;s roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he photographed and had sexual intercourse with the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce&#x27;s and Luchessa&#x27;s severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August of that year, Pesce&#x27;s skull was found on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of Pesce&#x27;s remains or a trace of Luchessa.

===Aiko Koo===
On the evening of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up a 15-year-old dance student named Aiko Koo, who had decided to hitchhike to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, where he pulled a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside, despite the fact that the gun was still in the car. Back inside the car, he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her, and kill her.

Kemper subsequently packed Koo&#x27;s body into the trunk of his car and went to a nearby bar to have a few drinks, then returned to his apartment. He later confessed that after exiting the bar, he opened the trunk of his car, &quot;admiring [his] catch like a fisherman.&quot; Back at his apartment, he had sexual intercourse with the corpse, then dismembered and disposed of the remains in a similar manner as his previous two victims. Koo&#x27;s mother called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information, but she did not receive any responses regarding her daughter&#x27;s location or status.

===Cindy Schall===
On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had moved back in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Anne &quot;Cindy&quot; Schall. He drove to a wooded area and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove to his mother&#x27;s house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sexual intercourse with and removed the bullet from Schall&#x27;s corpse, then dismembered and decapitated her in his mother&#x27;s bathtub.

Kemper kept Schall&#x27;s severed head for several days, regularly engaging in irrumatio with it, then buried it in his mother&#x27;s garden facing upward toward her bedroom. After his arrest, he stated that he did this because his mother &quot;always wanted people to look up to her.&quot; He discarded the rest of Schall&#x27;s remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all except Schall&#x27;s head and right hand were discovered and &quot;pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.&quot; A pathologist determined that Schall had been cut into pieces with a power saw.

=== Rosalind Thorpe and Allison Liu ===
On February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims. With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students had been advised to accept rides only from cars with university stickers on them. Kemper was able to obtain a sticker, as his mother worked at UC Santa Cruz (UCSC). He separately encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen &quot;Allison&quot; Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, he first encountered Thorpe as she exited a building, having attended a lecture. Thorpe entered the front passenger seat and, believing Kemper to be a fellow student, began chatting amiably as he drove. Shortly thereafter, he observed Liu—whom he described as a &quot;small Chinese girl&quot;—&quot;thumbing a ride&quot;. Kemper stopped his vehicle, and Liu entered the back seat of his car.

Shortly thereafter, Kemper slowed his vehicle, then shot Thorpe in the head with a .22 pistol; he then turned toward Liu as she cowered and squirmed in the back seat of his car. His first two shots missed the terrified girl, although his third bullet hit her in the temple. Their bodies were then wrapped in blankets.

Kemper again brought his victims&#x27; bodies back to his mother&#x27;s house; this time he beheaded them in his car and carried the headless corpses into his mother&#x27;s house to have sexual intercourse with them. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification, and discarded their remains the next morning. Some remains were found at Eden Canyon a week later, and more were found near Route 1 in March.

When questioned in an interview as to why he decapitated his victims, he explained: &quot;The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That&#x27;s the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off ... well, that&#x27;s not quite true, there&#x27;s a lot left in the girl&#x27;s body without the head.&quot;

===Clarnell (Kemper) Strandberg and Sally Hallett===
On April 20, 1973, Kemper was awakened by his mother, Clarnell Strandberg, coming home from a party. While sitting in her bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said to him, &quot;I suppose you&#x27;re going to want to sit up all night and talk now.&quot; Kemper replied, &quot;No, good night.&quot; He waited for her to fall asleep, then he snuck back into her room to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a penknife. Kemper then beheaded her and &quot;humiliated her corpse,&quot; as stated in a 1984 interview. Kemper stated that he &quot;put [her head] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour ... threw darts at it,&quot; and, ultimately, &quot;smashed her face in.&quot; He also cut out her tongue and larynx and put them in the garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. &quot;That seemed appropriate, as much as she&#x27;d bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years&quot;, Kemper later said.

Kemper hid his mother&#x27;s corpse in a closet and went to drink at a nearby bar. Upon his return, he invited his mother&#x27;s best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor &quot;Sally&quot; Hallett, over to the house to have dinner and watch a movie. When Hallett arrived, Kemper strangled her. He subsequently put Hallett&#x27;s corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance, and left a note to the police. It read:

Afterward, Kemper fled the scene. He drove non-stop to Pueblo, Colorado, taking caffeine pills to stay awake for the over 1,000-mile (about 1,600 km) journey. He had three guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his car, and he believed he was the target of an active manhunt. After not hearing any news on the radio about the murders of his mother and Hallett when he arrived in Pueblo, he found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again, asking to speak to an officer he personally knew. He confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, then waited for the police to arrive and take him into custody. Upon his capture, Kemper also confessed to the murders of the six students.

When asked in a later interview why he turned himself in, Kemper said: &quot;The original purpose was gone ... It wasn&#x27;t serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time ... Emotionally, I couldn&#x27;t handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off.&quot;

==Trial==
Kemper was indicted on eight counts of first-degree murder on May 7, 1973. He was assigned the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson. Due to Kemper&#x27;s explicit and detailed confession, his counsel&#x27;s only option was to plead not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges. Kemper tried to commit suicide twice while in custody. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.

Three court-appointed psychiatrists found Kemper to be legally sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis that he was once psychotic. Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer. Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism.

California used the M&#x27;Naghten standard, which held that for a defendant to &quot;establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&quot; Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts was wrong, and he had shown signs of malice aforethought.

On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the victims because he wanted them &quot;for myself, like possessions&quot;, and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could have been committed only by someone with an aberrant mind. He stated that two beings inhabited his body and that when the killer personality took over, it was &quot;kind of like blacking out.&quot;

On November 8, 1973, the six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for five hours before declaring Kemper sane and guilty on all counts. He asked for the death penalty, requesting &quot;death by torture.&quot; However, with a moratorium placed on capital punishment by the Supreme Court of California, he instead received seven years to life for each count, with these terms to be served concurrently, and was sentenced to the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.

==Psychology and beliefs==
Shortly after arriving at California Medical Facility in 1973, Kemper was admitted to psychiatrists for re-evaluation. He was re-diagnosed with antisocial, narcissistic, and schizotypal personality disorders. Kemper is a Christian and stated in an interview that he had &quot;learned to live with myself and God&quot;.

==Imprisonment==
In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in the same prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time and in the same area as Kemper. He described Mullin as &quot;just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason.&quot; Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at , was a foot shorter than he. Kemper stated that &quot;[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I&#x27;d give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That&#x27;s called behavior modification treatment.&quot;

Kemper remains among the general population in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He was in charge of scheduling other inmates&#x27; appointments with psychiatrists and was an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups. He was also a prolific narrator of audiobooks for a charity program that prepared material for the visually impaired; a 1987 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article stated that he was the coordinator of the prison&#x27;s program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name. Kemper was retired from these positions in 2015 after he experienced a stroke and was declared medically disabled. He received his first rules violation report in 2016 for failing to provide a urine sample.

While imprisoned, Kemper has participated in a number of interviews, including a segment in the 1982 documentary &quot;The Killing of America&quot;, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary &quot;Murder: No Apparent Motive&quot;. His interviews have contributed to the understanding of the mind of serial killers. FBI profiler John E. Douglas described Kemper as &quot;among the brightest&quot; prison inmates he interviewed and capable of &quot;rare insight for a violent criminal.&quot; He further added that he personally liked Kemper, referring to him as &quot;friendly, open, sensitive, [and having] a good sense of humor.&quot; However, Kemper&#x27;s discussions with Robert Ressler changed how the FBI conducted interviews with serial killers. According to Ann Burgess, Kemper told Ressler at the end of one of their interviews, &quot;The guard isn&#x27;t coming back. They&#x27;re on change of shift. He&#x27;s not going to be here for 30 minutes. In that time, I could snap your head and leave it on the table. I&#x27;d own the prison then. I killed an FBI agent.&quot; After the guard came back, Kemper said he was joking. Regardless, FBI agents were required to conduct interviews in pairs and could no longer do this alone.

Kemper is forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has stated that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing. At the end of his &quot;Murder: No Apparent Motive&quot; interview, he said, &quot;There&#x27;s somebody out there that is watching this and hasn&#x27;t done that — hasn&#x27;t killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn&#x27;t a crime; thinking that way isn&#x27;t a crime. Doing it isn&#x27;t just a crime; it&#x27;s a horrible thing. It doesn&#x27;t know when to quit, and it can&#x27;t be stopped easily once it starts.&quot; He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.

Kemper was first eligible for parole in 1979. He was denied parole that year, as well as at parole hearings in 1980, 1981, and 1982. He subsequently waived his right to a hearing in 1985. He was denied parole at his 1988 hearing, where he said, &quot;Society is not ready in any shape or form for me. I can&#x27;t fault them for that.&quot; He was denied parole again in 1991 and in 1994. He then waived his right to a hearing in 1997 and in 2002. He attended the next hearing in 2007, where he was again denied parole. Prosecutor Ariadne Symons said, &quot;We don&#x27;t care how much of a model prisoner he is because of the enormity of his crimes.&quot; Kemper waived his right to a hearing again in 2012. He was denied parole in 2017, and after declining to attend a parole hearing in 2024, Kemper was denied parole again. He is next eligible in 2031. Following his 2024 parole hearing, it was reported that Kemper was wheelchair-bound, and suffered from diabetes and coronary heart disease. A psychiatric evaluation conducted in April 2024 classified him as a &quot;high risk&quot; to reoffend.

==In popular culture==
Kemper has influenced many works of film and literature. He and fellow serial killers Ted Bundy, Gary M. Heidnik, Jerry Brudos, and Ed Gein were used as an inspiration for the character of Buffalo Bill in Thomas Harris&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Like Kemper, Buffalo Bill fatally shoots his grandparents as a teenager. Dean Koontz cited Kemper as an inspiration for Edgler Vess, the villain of his 1996 novel &quot;Intensity&quot;.

The character Patrick Bateman in the 2000 film &quot;American Psycho&quot; mistakenly attributes a quote by Kemper to Gein, saying: &quot;You know what Ed Gein said about women? ... He said &#x27;When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right ... [the other part wonders] what her head would look like on a stick&#x27;.&quot;

A direct-to-video horror film loosely based on Kemper&#x27;s murders, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in 2008. In 2012, French author Marc Dugain published a novel, &quot;Avenue des géants&quot; (&quot;Avenue of the Giants&quot;), about Kemper. Kemper was portrayed by 6&#x27;5&quot; actor Cameron Britton in three episodes (nos. 2, 3 and 10) of the first season of the 2017 Netflix television drama series &quot;Mindhunter&quot;, as well as the fifth episode of the show&#x27;s second season. Britton received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for this role.

Kemper has been the subject of multiple books, including &quot;Edmund Kemper: The True Story of the Co-Ed Killer&quot; and &quot;The Co‑Ed Killer: A Study of the Murders, Mutilations, and Matricide of Edmund Kemper III&quot;. Extracts from Kemper&#x27;s interviews have been used in numerous songs, including &quot;Love // Hate&quot; by Dystopia, &quot;Abomination Unseen&quot; by Devourment, &quot;Forever&quot; by The Berzerker, &quot;Severed Head&quot; by Suicide Commando, &quot;New Flesh&quot; by Pitchshifter, and &quot;Crave&quot; by Optimum Wound Profile. He is discussed in many songs, such as &quot;Edmund Kemper Had a Horrible Temper&quot; by Macabre, &quot;Fortress&quot; by System of a Down, &quot;Temper Temper Mr. Kemper&quot; by The Celibate Rifles, &quot;Murder&quot; by Seabound, &quot;Killfornia (Ed Kemper)&quot; by Church of Misery, &quot;Edmund Temper&quot; by Amigo the Devil and &quot;Edmund Kemper&quot; by SKYND. The whole musical album &quot;Vile Postmortem Irrumatio&quot; by Austrian death metal band Monument of Misanthropy is a concept record about Ed Kemper.

<doc id="1157616" wikidata="Q4205186" url="?curid=1157616" title="Disappearance of the Beaumont children">
<text>Jane Nartare Beaumont (born 10 September 1956), Arnna Kathleen Beaumont (born 11 November 1958) and Grant Ellis Beaumont (born 12 July 1961), collectively referred to as the Beaumont children, were three Australian siblings who disappeared from Glenelg Beach near Adelaide, South Australia, on 26 January 1966 (Australia Day) in a suspected abduction and murder.

Police investigations revealed that, on the day of their disappearance, several witnesses had seen the three children on and near Glenelg Beach in the company of a tall man with fairish to light-brown hair and a thin face with a sun-tanned complexion and medium build, aged in his mid-thirties. Confirmed sightings of the children occurred at the Colley Reserve and at Wenzel&#x27;s cake shop on Moseley Street, Glenelg. Despite numerous searches, neither the children nor their suspected companion were located.

The case received worldwide attention and is credited with causing a change in Australian lifestyles, since parents began to believe that their children could no longer be presumed to be safe when unsupervised in public. In recent years, police and media speculation has linked the disappearances to the Adelaide Oval abductions of 1973. Interest in the case has continued more than half a century on. , a $1 million reward has been offered for information related to the cold case by the South Australian government.

==Background==

Jane, Arnna and Grant Beaumont lived with their parents, Grant &quot;Jim&quot; Beaumont, a former serviceman and taxi driver, and Nancy Beaumont (née Ellis); the couple had married in December 1955. The family resided at 109 Harding Street, Somerton Park, South Australia, a suburb of Adelaide. They lived not far from Glenelg Beach, a popular spot that the children often visited. On 25 January 1966, in the midst of a summer heatwave, Jim dropped the children off at Glenelg Beach before heading off on a three-day sales trip to Snowtown.

On the morning of 26 January (Australia Day), the Beaumont children asked their mother to visit Glenelg Beach again. As it was too hot to walk, they took a five-minute, three-kilometre bus journey from their home to the beach. The children caught the bus at 8:45 am and were expected to return home on the 12:00 noon bus. Nancy became worried, however, when the siblings did not return on either the 12:00 or 2:00 pm buses, and when Jim returned home early from his trip around 3:00 pm, he immediately drove to the crowded beach. Unable to locate the children, he returned and together both parents searched the streets and visited friends&#x27; houses. Around 5:30 pm, they went to Glenelg police station to report the disappearance.

==Police investigation==
Police quickly organised a search of Glenelg Beach and adjacent areas, based on the assumption that the Beaumont children were nearby and had simply lost track of time. The search then expanded to the sand-hills, ocean and nearby buildings, with the airport, rail lines and interstate roads being monitored as well, based on a fear of accident or kidnap. Within twenty-four hours, the entire nation was aware of the case. Within three days, on 29 January, the Adelaide &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; led with a headline of &quot;Sex crime now feared&quot;, highlighting the rapidly evolving fear that the children had been abducted and murdered by a sex offender. Despite this, the initial official reward was only A£250.

The Patawalonga Boat Haven was drained on 29 January after a woman told police that she had spoken with three children, who were similar in description to the Beaumont children, near the haven at 7:00 pm on the day of the disappearance. Police cadets and members of the emergency operations group searched the area, but nothing was found.

===Prime suspect===
Police investigating the case found several witnesses who had seen the Beaumont children in Colley Reserve, near Glenelg Beach, in the company of a tall man with fair to light brown hair and a thin face, and in his mid-thirties. The man had a sun-tanned complexion and a thin-to-athletic build, and was wearing swim trunks. The children were playing with him, and appeared to be relaxed and enjoying themselves. The man also approached one of the witnesses, asking if anyone had been near the children&#x27;s belongings as their money was &quot;missing&quot;. The man then went off to change while the children waited for him. The group were then seen walking away together from the beach sometime later, which the police estimated to be around 12:15 pm. About two-and-a-half hours later another witness, Miss Daphne Gregory, sighted the children with the man, who she observed carrying an airline bag similar to one owned by Jane.

The Beaumont parents described their children, particularly the eldest (Jane) as shy. For them to be playing so confidently with a stranger seemed out of character. Investigators theorised that the children had perhaps met the man during a previous visit or visits and had grown to trust him. A chance remark at home, which seemed insignificant at the time, supports this theory: Arnna had told her mother that Jane had &quot;got a boyfriend down the beach&quot;. Nancy thought she meant a playmate and took no further notice until after the disappearance.

A shopkeeper at nearby Wenzel&#x27;s Bakery, on Moseley Street, reported that Jane had bought pasties and a meat pie with a £1 note. Police viewed this as further evidence that the Beaumont children had been with another person, for two reasons: the shopkeeper knew the children well from previous visits and reported that they had never purchased a meat pie before, and the children&#x27;s mother had given them only six shillings and six pence, enough for their bus fare and lunch, and not £1. Police believed the money had been given to them by somebody else.

===Other sightings===
According to an initial statement, the Beaumont children were seen walking alone at 2:55 pm, away from the beach along Jetty Road, in the general direction of their home. The witness, a postman, knew the children well, and his statement was regarded as reliable. He said the children were &quot;holding hands and laughing&quot; in the main street. Police could not determine why the reliable children, already one hour late, were strolling alone and seemingly unconcerned. The postman contacted police two days after his initial statement and said that he thought he saw them in the morning, not the afternoon as he had previously said.

Several months later, a woman reported that on the night of the disappearance, a man, accompanied by two girls and a boy, entered a neighbouring house that she had believed empty. Later, the woman said she had seen the boy walking alone along a lane where he was pursued and roughly caught by the man. The next morning the house appeared to be deserted again, and she saw neither the man nor the children again. Police could not establish why she had failed to provide this information earlier.

Other reported sightings of the children continued for about a year after their disappearance.

===Gerard Croiset===
The Beaumont case attracted international attention. On 8 November 1966, Gerard Croiset, a Dutch psychic, was brought to Australia to assist in the search, which caused a furor in the press. Croiset&#x27;s efforts proved unsuccessful, with his story changing day-to-day and offering no clues. He identified a spot at a warehouse near the children&#x27;s home in which he believed their bodies had been buried, inside the remains of an old brick kiln. The property owners, who were reluctant to excavate based only on a psychic&#x27;s claim, soon bowed to public pressure after publicity helped raise A$40,000 to have the building demolished. No remains, nor any evidence tied to any members of the Beaumont family, was found. In 1996, the building identified by Croiset was undergoing partial demolition and the owners allowed a full search of the site. Once again, no trace was found of the children.

===Hoax letters===
About two years after the disappearance, the Beaumont parents received two letters: one was supposedly written by Jane, and another by a man who said he was keeping the children. The envelopes showed a postmark of Dandenong, Victoria. The brief notes described a relatively pleasant existence and referred to &quot;The Man&quot; who was keeping them. Police believed at the time that the letters could quite likely have been authentic after comparing them with others written by Jane. The letter from &quot;The Man&quot; said that he had appointed himself &quot;guardian&quot; of the children and was willing to hand them back to their parents. In the letter a meeting place was nominated.

The Beaumont parents, followed by a detective, drove to the designated place but nobody appeared. Some time later a third letter arrived, also purported to be from Jane, stating that the man had realised a disguised detective was present and that he decided to keep the children because the Beaumonts had betrayed his trust. There were no further letters. In 1992, new forensic examinations of the letters showed they were a hoax. Fingerprint technology had improved and the author was identified as a 41-year-old man who had been a teenager at the time and had written the letters as a joke. Because of the time that had elapsed, he was not charged with any offence.

==Possible suspects==
===Bevan Spencer von Einem===

Bevan Spencer von Einem (born 1946) was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1984 for murdering Richard Kelvin, the teenage son of Adelaide newsreader Rob Kelvin. Police and prosecutors publicly stated that they believed von Einem had accomplices and was possibly involved in additional murders. About this time, police came to suspect his involvement in the Beaumont disappearance as well. No accomplices were ever charged. Von Einem has refused to co-operate with investigators about his possible connection with other murders.

During the investigation into von Einem, police heard from an informant identified only as &quot;Mr B&quot;. He related an alleged conversation in which von Einem boasted of having taken three children from a beach several years earlier, and said he had taken them home to conduct &quot;experiments&quot;. According to Mr B&#x27;s account, von Einem claimed to have performed &quot;brilliant surgery&quot; on each of the children and had &quot;connected them up&quot;. One of the children had supposedly died during the procedure, and so he had killed the other two and dumped the bodies in bushland south of Adelaide. Police had not previously considered von Einem in connection with the Beaumont case, but he resembled descriptions and identikits of the unidentified suspect from 1966. Mr B also claimed that von Einem had implicated himself in the Adelaide Oval abductions from 1973; like with the Beaumont case, von Einem matches descriptions of the main suspect in the Oval case.

According to Adelaide police detective Bob O&#x27;Brien, Mr B had given important information during the investigation into the Kelvin murder and was regarded as a generally reliable source. However, police reception of the alleged confession was mixed. There were enough plausible details to warrant further research, yet other details relayed by Mr B did not fit with known facts about the Beaumont case and were regarded with scepticism. , von Einem had not been ruled out as a suspect.

Mr B&#x27;s reference to alleged surgical experimentation corresponded to the coroner&#x27;s reports on several of von Einem&#x27;s alleged murder victims. However, while von Einem was known to have frequented Glenelg Beach to &quot;perv&quot; on the changing rooms, and was described as preoccupied with children, he was younger than the unidentified suspect (who was reported to be in his mid- to late thirties, whereas von Einem was in his early twenties). The Beaumont children were also much younger than Richard Kelvin or the other young men von Einem is believed to have targeted, who were in their teens or twenties. Such disparities in the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of a serial killer are unusual, but not unheard of.

Investigations into both the Beaumont disappearance and the Adelaide Oval abductions remain officially open and, in 1989, von Einem was identified as a suspect in a confidential police report. In August 2007, it was reported that police were examining archival footage from the original Beaumont search, shot by Channel Seven, that shows a young man resembling von Einem among onlookers. The report said that police were calling for information to establish the man&#x27;s identity.

===Arthur Stanley Brown===

Arthur Stanley Brown (1912–2002) was charged in 1998 with the murders of sisters Judith and Susan Mackay in Townsville, Queensland. They had disappeared on their way to school on 26 August 1970 and were found strangled several days later in a dry creek bed. Brown&#x27;s trial, scheduled for July 2000, was delayed after his lawyer applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. He was never retried as he was found to have dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Brown died in 2002.

Similar to von Einem, Brown bore a striking similarity to descriptions and identikits of the suspect for both the Beaumont and Oval cases. A search for a connection to the Beaumont children was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on Brown&#x27;s movements at the time. Some of the records were believed lost in the 1974 Brisbane flood. It is also possible that Brown, who had unrestricted access to government buildings, may have destroyed his own files.

Although there is no proof that he had ever visited Adelaide, a witness recalled having a conversation with Brown in which he mentioned having seen the Adelaide Festival Centre nearing completion, which would place him in the city shortly before the Oval abduction on 25 August 1973. However, no evidence has ever been found to connect Brown with Adelaide in 1966. Brown was aged 53 at the time of the Beaumont disappearance, which does not match the description of the suspect seen with the children, who was reported as being in his thirties.

===James Ryan O&#x27;Neill===

James O&#x27;Neill (born 1947), who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1975 murder of a nine-year-old boy in Tasmania, is reported to have previously told several acquaintances that he was responsible for the Beaumont disappearance. In 2006, O&#x27;Neill lost an injunction in the High Court of Australia to stop the broadcast of an ABC documentary, &quot;The Fishermen&quot;, which attempted to link him to the case.

Former Victorian detective Gordon Davie spent three years speaking to O&#x27;Neill to win his confidence before filming him for &quot;The Fishermen&quot;. Davie said that although there was no evidence to link O&#x27;Neill to the Beaumont case, he was persuaded that O&#x27;Neill was to blame. &quot;I asked him about the Beaumonts and he said: &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t have done it. I was in Melbourne at that time.&#x27; That is not a denial.&quot; Later asked again if he had murdered the children, O&#x27;Neill replied, &quot;Look, on legal advice I am not going to say where I was or when I was there.&quot; Although O&#x27;Neill claims never to have visited Adelaide, his work in the opal industry at the time required that he frequently visit Coober Pedy, which would have required him to pass through the city. Davie also suspected O&#x27;Neill was involved in the Oval case. The South Australia Police have interviewed O&#x27;Neill and discounted him as a suspect in the Beaumont case.

===Derek Ernest Percy===

Derek Percy (1948–2013), a convicted child murderer and Victoria&#x27;s then-longest-serving prisoner, was suggested in a 2007 article in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper as a suspect in the Beaumont case. &quot;The Age&quot; alleged that evidence gathered by cold case investigators pointed to Percy in a number of unsolved child murders, including the Beaumont case. His insanity plea in the 1969 murder of Yvonne Tuohy was at least partly based on his suffering a psychological condition that could prevent him remembering details of his actions. Percy was supposed to have indicated that he believed he might have killed the Beaumont children, as he was in the area at the time, but he had no recollection of actually doing so. On 30 August 2007, Victoria Police successfully applied for permission to question Percy in relation to the Beaumont case.

In 1966, Percy was aged 17 and therefore seems too young to have been the unidentified suspect seen with the children. It is also unknown whether Percy would have had access to a car at that time, while the unidentified suspect is presumed by commentators to have had access to one for facilitating a quick getaway and also for disposing of the children&#x27;s bodies later. Percy was imprisoned from 1969 until his death in 2013, which means that he could not have been the suspect in the Adelaide Oval abductions, whom many investigators believe to be connected to the Beaumont case.

===Alan Anthony Munro===
Alan Maxwell McIntyre (died 2017)—who had himself been investigated by police and cleared of involvement in the Beaumont case—gave a secondhand account to the Adelaide &quot;Advertiser&quot; that a man he had known in 1966, who by 2015 was being sought in Southeast Asia in connection with child abuse incidents there, had come to his home with the children&#x27;s bodies in the boot of his car. McIntyre&#x27;s children said that they and their father initially mistook Arnna&#x27;s body for that of a boy because of her short haircut. 

The man in question was later identified as businessman Alan Anthony Munro (aged 75 in 2017), a former scoutmaster who had pleaded guilty to ten child sex offences dating back to 1962. For these crimes, Munro was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years and five months, making him eligible for release in 2022.

In June 2017, Adelaide police detectives were given a copy of a child&#x27;s diary, written in 1966, which allegedly placed Munro in the vicinity of Glenelg Beach at the time of the Beaumont disappearance. He was convicted of abusing several children, including one of McIntyre&#x27;s sons, who was a contributor to the diary. Munro had been previously investigated by police, but no evidence had been found that he was involved in the Beaumont case.

=== Harry Phipps ===
Harry Phipps (died 2004), a local factory owner and then-member of Adelaide&#x27;s social elite, came to attention as a possible suspect after the publication of the book &quot;The Satin Man: Uncovering the Mystery of the Missing Beaumont Children&quot; in 2013. The book did not name the identity of the Satin Man, but Phipps&#x27; estranged son, Haydn, named him soon after the book&#x27;s publication.

Phipps bore a substantial likeness to the identity of the man seen talking to the Beaumont children at Glenelg Beach. He was wealthy and known to be in the habit of giving out £1 notes, was later alleged to have been a paedophile and lived only 300 metres away from the beach on the corner of Augusta Street and Sussex Street. Haydn, who was aged 15 at the time of the disappearance, came forward to researchers in 2007 with the claim that he had seen the children in his father&#x27;s yard on 26 January. Two other persons, youths at the time, said that they had been paid by Phipps to dig a 2 × 1 × 2-metre hole in his factory yard that weekend, for unstated reasons.

====North Plympton excavations====
In November 2013, a one-metre-squared section of a factory in North Plympton, which had been owned by Phipps, was excavated. A ground-penetrating radar found &quot;one small anomaly, which can indicate movement or objects within the soil&quot;, but the dig found no additional evidence and investigations into the site were closed.

On 22 January 2018, Adelaide detectives announced that they would return to the factory site and conduct further excavations, after a private investigation sponsored by Channel Seven in Adelaide. The excavation, on 2 February 2018, took nine hours. Animal bones and general rubbish were found, but nothing related to the Beaumont case.

In February 2025, based on new evidence, South Australian MP Frank Pangallo organised a third, privately funded, excavation at the site. The week-long search did not find any remains of the children.

== Legacy ==
The Beaumont case resulted in one of the largest police investigations in Australian history and remains one of Australia&#x27;s most infamous cold cases, even after many decades. In January 2018, the Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, said that South Australia Police had &quot;never given up on the case&quot; and that they &quot;have a policy that no murder investigation ends up in a closed file&quot;. The State Government also continues to maintain a A$1 million reward for information relating to the children&#x27;s disappearance.

The kidnapping is also viewed by many social commentators as a significant event in the evolution of Australian society, with a large number of people changing the way they supervised their children daily. At the time, it was never publicly suggested that the children should not have been allowed to travel unsupervised, or that their parents were in any way negligent, simply because contemporary Australian society took it for granted that this was safe and acceptable. However, this case, alongside similar child-related crimes such as the 1960 Graeme Thorne kidnapping and the 1965 Wanda Beach murders &quot;marked an end of innocence in [post-war] Australian life&quot;.

The regular and widespread attention given to this case, its significance in Australian criminal history and the fact that the mystery of their disappearance has never been explained have led to the story being continually revisited by the media. New leads and clues are regularly reported by the media, and the case still regularly headlines print and broadcast media more than half a century on.

=== Parents ===
At the time of the investigation, the Beaumont parents received widespread sympathy from the Australian public. They remained at their Somerton Park home; Nancy in particular held hope that the children would return, and stated in interviews that it would be &quot;dreadful&quot; if the children returned home and did not find their parents waiting for them. Over the years, as new leads and new theories emerged, the Beaumonts co-operated fully in exploring every possibility, whether it was claims that the children had been abducted by a religious cult and were living variously in New Zealand, Melbourne or Tasmania, or some clue that suggested a possible burial site for the children. They were devastated in 1990 when newspapers published computer-generated photographs of how the children would have looked as adults. The pictures, published against their wishes, caused a huge wave of public sympathy from a community which was still sensitive to their pain.

The couple later divorced and lived separately, having resolved to live their final years away from the public attention that followed them for decades. They sold their Somerton Park home and the South Australian Police remained informed of the couple&#x27;s new addresses, as the case remains open. The Beaumonts were reported to have accepted that the truth of their children&#x27;s disappearances may never be discovered. Nancy died in an Adelaide nursing home on 16 September 2019, aged 92. Grant died, also in Adelaide, on 9 April 2023, aged 97.

== Media ==
The case attracted widespread police and media attention in Australia and beyond. The fact that the case has never been explained has led to the story being continually revisited by the media, and by newer online sites, more than fifty years after the children&#x27;s disappearance.

<text>Saint Paul College is a open access public community college in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System. The college enrolls about 11,000 students in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area, and it also employs 126 full-time faculty, 116 part-time faculty, 233 staff members, and 18 administrative members.

==History==
Saint Paul College was founded in 1910 as a boys&#x27; vocational high school. The first evening trade classes were held in the basement of Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1966, the college moved into its current facility and became Saint Paul Technical Vocational Institute, or Saint Paul TVI. In 2002, the college added liberal arts to its curriculum and changed its name to Saint Paul College – A Community &amp; Technical College.

Saint Paul College was home to the nation&#x27;s oldest watchmaking and clockmaking programs. In its last few years, it was awarded a grant from Rolex and started offering the WOSTEP certificate, an industry wide accepted certification for watchmaking excellence.

In the spring of 2019, the college briefly gained national attention when a site visit team of the college&#x27;s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), documented several reports from college faculty members alleging that the college president&#x27;s leadership style was &quot;grounded in fear and intimidation.&quot; Shortly thereafter, President Rassoul Dastmozd announced that he would resign on June 30.

In March 2021, Deidra Peaslee was named president, becoming the first female president at the college. A few months later, HLC removed the institution from probation and assigned interim monitoring after determining that the college was in compliance with its accreditation criteria.

==Academics==
Saint Paul College offers more than one hundred degree, certificate, and diploma programs in career and transfer education.

==Campus==
Saint Paul College is located in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood near downtown St. Paul. Its current campus is 520,968 square feet with one building. The college opened an addition in 2017 called the Saint Paul College Health and Science Alliance Center which serves as the primary space for the College’s STEM and health career programs.

<doc id="1157626" wikidata="Q444380" url="?curid=1157626" title="Imogen Holst">
<text>Imogen Clare Holst (; 12 April 1907 – 9 March 1984) was a British composer, arranger, conductor, teacher, musicologist, and festival administrator. The only child of the composer Gustav Holst, she is particularly known for her educational work at Dartington Hall in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival. In addition to composing music, she wrote composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father.

From a young age, Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, she entered the Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer for health reasons, Holst spent most of the 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.

In the early 1950s Holst became Benjamin Britten&#x27;s musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten&#x27;s assistant to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father&#x27;s musical legacy. Her own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.

==Background==

===Early life and family===

Imogen Holst was born on 12 April 1907 at 31 Grena Road, Richmond, a riverside town to the west of London. Her parents were Gustav Theodore Holst, an aspiring composer then working as a music teacher, and Isobel, &quot;née&quot; Harrison. The Holst family, of mixed Swedish, German and Latvian ancestry, had been in England since 1802 and had been musicians for several generations. Gustav followed this family tradition; while studying at the Royal College of Music (RCM), he met Isobel Harrison, who sang in one of the amateur choirs that he conducted. He was immediately attracted to her, and they were married on 22 July 1901.

While attempting to establish himself as a composer, Gustav Holst worked first as an orchestral trombonist, and later as a teacher. In 1907 he held teaching posts at James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Dulwich, and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (SPGS) in Hammersmith, where he was director of music. From 1907 he acted as director of music at Morley College, an adult education centre in the Waterloo district of London. When Imogen was still very small the family moved from Richmond to a small house by the river in nearby Barnes, which they rented from a relative. Imogen&#x27;s main memories of this house were of her father working in his composing room on the top floor, which she was forbidden to visit, and of his efforts to teach her folk-songs.

===Schooling===

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father&#x27;s, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts&#x27; rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.

In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav&#x27;s star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of &quot;compertishions, and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea&quot;. At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as &quot;topping&quot;) and theory with Jane Joseph (&quot;ripping&quot;). Under Joseph&#x27;s tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a &quot;Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds&quot;, which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.

Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul&#x27;s Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father&#x27;s production of Purcell&#x27;s semi-opera from 1690, &quot;Masque of Dioclesian&quot;, held in the St Paul&#x27;s School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.

In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul&#x27;s Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: &quot;I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the end of it&quot;. Imogen&#x27;s SPGS years were generally happy and successful. In July 1923 she won the junior Alice Lupton piano prize, but her chances of distinction as a pianist were marred when she began to develop phlebitis in her left arm. Among other activities she became interested in folk music and dance, and in 1923 became a member of the English Folk Dance Society (EFDS). In 1924–25, her final year at SPGS, Imogen founded a folk dance society in the school. At an end-of-term school concert late in July 1925, she played Chopin&#x27;s étude in E major and gave the first performance of Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Toccata&quot;.

====Royal College of Music====

Although destined like her father for the RCM, Holst first spent a year studying composition with Herbert Howells, piano with Adine O&#x27;Neill and the French horn with Adolph Borsdorf, while participating in the EFDS summer schools and other musical activities. In July 1926 she arranged and conducted the music for an EFDS pageant, held at Thaxted as a fund-raiser towards the building of the society&#x27;s new headquarters at Regent&#x27;s Park. Holst began at the RCM in September 1926, studying piano with Kathleen Long, composition with George Dyson, and conducting under W. H. Reed. Her aptitude as a conductor was evident in December 1926, when she led the college&#x27;s Third Orchestra in the opening movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Prague&quot; Symphony. This and other performances on the podium led &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to speculate that Holst might eventually become the first woman to &quot;establish a secure tenure of the conductor&#x27;s platform&quot;.

In her second RCM year Holst concentrated on composition, producing several chamber works including a violin sonata, an oboe quintet, and a suite for woodwind. She took her first steps towards personal independence when she moved from the family home to a bedsit near Kensington Gardens. In 1928 she went to Belgium with the EFDS, took an Italian holiday, and made an extended trip to Germany with a group known as &quot;The Travelling Morrice&quot; which promoted international understanding through music and dance. In October 1928 she won the RCM&#x27;s Cobbett prize for an original chamber composition, her &quot;Phantasy&quot; String Quartet, and shortly afterwards was awarded the Morley Scholarship for the &quot;best all-round student&quot;. The quartet was broadcast by the BBC on 20 March 1929, but for her, the achievement was overshadowed by the news that month of the premature death at 34 of her early mentor Jane Joseph.

In the winter of 1929 Holst made her first visit to Canada and the United States, as part of an EFDS party. Back home, she worked on her RCM finals composition, a suite for brass band entitled &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;. Despite some apprehension on her part, the piece passed the examiners&#x27; scrutiny and was played at the college&#x27;s end-of-year concert in July 1930. Before then, in June, Holst learned that she had been awarded an Octavia Travelling Scholarship worth £100, which would enable her to study composition abroad.

==Career==

===European travels, 1930–31===
Holst spent much of the period between September 1930 and May 1931 travelling. A hectic visit to Liège in September, for the International Society of Contemporary Music Congress, was followed immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary, returning to England via Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her musical experiences included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg, performances of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; at the Vienna State Opera, Bach in Berlin and Mahler&#x27;s Seventh Symphony in Amsterdam. On 1 February 1932 she left England again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour Holst came home with mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that &quot;the Italians are a nation of singers ... But music is a different language in that part of the world&quot;. Back in London, she decided that despite her experiences, &quot;if it is music one is wanting, there is no place like London.&quot;

===Mainly teaching, 1931–38===

With her scholarship funds exhausted, Holst needed a job, and in June 1931 took charge of music at the Citizen House arts and education centre in Bath. She disliked the disciplines imposed by an unsympathetic and unyielding superior, but stayed until the end of the year, by which time Citizen House had relocated to Hampstead. She worked briefly as a freelance conductor and accompanist before joining the staff of the EFDS early in 1932. The organisation had by now expanded to become the &quot;English Folk Dance and Song Society&quot; (EFDSS) and was based in new headquarters at Cecil Sharp House. The duties, mainly teaching, were not full-time, and she was able to take up part-time teaching posts at her old school, Eothen, and at Roedean School. Although she composed little original music during these years, she made many instrumental and vocal arrangements of traditional folk melodies.

Gustav Holst&#x27;s health had been poor for years; in the winter of 1933–34 it deteriorated, and he died on 25 May 1934. Imogen Holst privately determined that she would establish and protect her father&#x27;s musical legacy. On 24 March 1935 she took part in a Gustav Holst memorial concert, in which she conducted her own arrangement of one of her father&#x27;s brass band suites. Meanwhile, her own music was beginning to attract attention. Her carol arrangement &quot;Nowell and Nowell&quot; was performed in a 1934 Christmas concert in Chichester Cathedral, and the following year saw the premiere of her Concerto for Violin and Strings, with Elsie Avril as the soloist. In 1936 she paid a visit to Hollywood, where she stayed with her uncle (Gustav&#x27;s brother), the actor Ernest Cossart. Back in England, Holst worked on recorder arrangements of music by the neglected 17th-century composer Pelham Humphrey. These were published in 1936 to a positive critical reception.

In 1938 Holst published a biography of her father. Among many positive comments from friends and critics, the composer Edmund Rubbra praised her for producing a book that was not &quot;clouded by sentiment ... her biography is at once intimate and objective&quot;.

===War: travelling for CEMA===
In 1938 Holst decided to abandon amateur music-making and teaching to concentrate on her own professional development. She resigned her EFDSS post while continuing to honour existing commitments to the organisation. She had given up her work at Roedean in 1936; at Easter 1939 she resigned from Eothen. In June 1939 she began a tour of Switzerland which included the Lucerne Festival. Towards the end of August, as war became increasingly likely, she broke off the trip and returned home.

After the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, Holst worked for the Bloomsbury House Refugee Committee, which supported German and Austrian refugee musicians interned under emergency regulations. In January 1940 she accepted a position under a scheme organised by the Pilgrim Trust, to act as one of six &quot;music travellers&quot;, whose brief was to boost morale by encouraging musical activities in rural communities. Holst was assigned to cover the west of England, a huge area stretching from Oxfordshire to Cornwall. When the government set up the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), responsibility for the music travellers passed to that body.

With little practical support from CEMA, Holst&#x27;s organisational talents, according to her friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, &quot;developed brilliantly&quot;. According to Holst&#x27;s own account, her duties included conducting local brass bands and Women&#x27;s Institute choirs (&quot;fourteen very old women in hats sitting round the edge of a dark, empty hideous tin hut&quot;), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged performances by professional groups, and what she termed &quot;drop-in-and-sing&quot; festivals in which anyone could join. She wrote of &quot;idyllic days&quot; spent over cups of tea, discussing the hopes and dreams of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the &quot;Offley&quot; and &quot;Deddington&quot; suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs.

===Dartington===

In 1938, Holst had visited Dartington Hall, a progressive school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, which had been founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942 she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre&#x27;s administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, &quot;the sort of thing that your father did in the old days at Morley College&quot;. Beginning in 1943, Holst established a one-year course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Holst&#x27;s leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: &quot;Hardly any of us could play ... However bad we were, we went on&quot;. Holst&#x27;s teaching methods, heavily based on &quot;learning by doing&quot; and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Holst at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: &quot;She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn&#x27;t be long before ... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank&quot;.

In the conducive atmosphere of Dartington Holst resumed serious composition, largely abandoned during the hectic CEMA years. In 1943 she completed a &quot;Serenade&quot; for flute, viola and bassoon, a &quot;Suite for String Orchestra&quot;, and a choral work, &quot;Three Psalms&quot;. All these works were performed at a Wigmore Hall concert on 14 June 1943 devoted to her music. Other compositions from the Dartington years included &quot;Theme and Variations&quot; for solo violin, String Trio No. 1 (premiered by the Dartington Hall String Trio at the National Gallery on 17 July 1944), songs from the 16th-century anthology Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany, an oboe concerto, and a string quartet. In October 1943 the composer Benjamin Britten and the tenor Peter Pears gave the first of several recitals at Dartington. A mutual respect and friendship developed between Britten and Holst, strengthened by their shared love of neglected music from the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Holst was convinced that Britten was the composer to continue and complete the work of her father in redefining the character of English music.

From 1945, while maintaining her commitment to Dartington, Holst began to widen her musical activities. As well as editing and preparing scores for Britten, she promoted Dartington as the base for Britten&#x27;s new English Opera Group, although eventually Glyndebourne was preferred. In 1947 she encouraged the refugee violinist Norbert Brainin to form his own string quartet, and arranged its debut at Dartington, as the &quot;Brainin Quartet&quot;, on 13 July 1947. Six months later, renamed the Amadeus Quartet, the group appeared at the Wigmore Hall, and went on to worldwide recognition. In 1948 she began work on a critical study of her father&#x27;s music, a companion volume to her 1938 Gustav Holst biography. When this was published in 1951, most critics praised its objectivity, one critic venturing that she had been &quot;unnecessarily harsh&quot; in her judgements.

On 23 July 1950 Holst conducted the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Five Flower Songs&quot; part songs in the open air at Dartington, composed for the 25th wedding anniversary of its owners. Rising standards of achievement at Dartington enabled Holst to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach&#x27;s death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute from one of the audience: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, and can&#x27;t imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus&quot;.

By the middle of 1950 Holst&#x27;s professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival; The work was the song cycle for female voices and harp, &quot;Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow&quot;. Sensing that it was time to leave Dartington, she gave a year&#x27;s notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her &quot;Ten Indian Folk Tunes&quot; for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, &quot;Benedick and Beatrice&quot;, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.

===Aldeburgh===
Without definite plans for her future after Dartington, Holst toured Europe, collecting music that she would later edit for performance, including madrigals by Carlo Gesualdo which she found &quot;very exciting&quot;. At home, although not formally employed by Britten, she worked with him on several projects, including a new performing version of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, and the preparation of the vocal and full scores for Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Billy Budd&quot;. Pears, who had observed Holst&#x27;s overall contributions to musical life at Dartington, believed she could help Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival on a more formal basis, and shortly after the 1952 festival Britten invited her to come and work with him. She agreed, and moved to lodgings in Aldeburgh.

====Assistant to Britten====

When Holst joined Britten, the financial arrangement was vague; Britten paid her on a piecemeal basis rather than a regular salary, unaware that she had made over her rights to her father&#x27;s estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own physical comfort. For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Alongside this work, she made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father&#x27;s music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes.

For the first 18 months of her association with Britten, Holst kept a diary which, Grogan says, forms a record of her &quot;unconditional belief in Britten&#x27;s achievement and status, and her absolute devotion to his work&quot;. The first of Britten&#x27;s works to which she made a significant contribution was the opera &quot;Gloriana&quot;, scheduled to form part of the 1953 Coronation celebrations. The short timescale for the writing of the opera placed considerable pressure on the composer and his new assistant, strains that were dramatised 60 years later in a radio play, &quot;Imo and Ben&quot;. Holst&#x27;s main task with &quot;Gloriana&quot; was to copy Britten&#x27;s pencil sketches and prepare the vocal and piano scores which the singers needed for rehearsals by February 1953. Later she assisted him with the writing of the full orchestral score, and performed similar services with his next opera, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1954). When Britten was under pressure during the composition of his ballet &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot; (1956), Holst accompanied him to Switzerland, to remain by his side as he completed the work. She took great pleasure in her association with Britten&#x27;s opera for children, &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; (1957), for which she showed Britten how to achieve a unique raindrop effect by hitting a row of china mugs with a wooden spoon. She and Britten combined to collect and publish music for the recorder, in a series published by Boosey and Hawkes (1954–59), and jointly wrote a popular introductory book, &quot;The Story of Music&quot; (1958).

Holst continued to assist Britten with all his major compositions until 1964, at that point she determined to give priority to the final securing of her father&#x27;s musical legacy, to re-establish her career as a composer, and to pursue a more independent path. She relinquished her post as Britten&#x27;s assistant, while remaining personally devoted to Britten. She did not leave Aldeburgh, and continued her work with the annual Aldeburgh Festival.

====Artistic director====
In 1956 Holst&#x27;s role in the Aldeburgh Festival was formalised when she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival&#x27;s artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. For the 1956 festival she scheduled a performance of Gustav Holst&#x27;s opera &quot;Savitri&quot;, the first of several Gustav Holst works that she introduced to the festival in the ensuing years. &quot;Savitri&quot; was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen&#x27;s arrangement of John Blow&#x27;s 17th century opera &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts, and in 1962 she organised a series devoted to Flemish music, in which she had recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes of church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Holst had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house was built on the edge of the site where it had been hoped to build a Festival Theatre. When that plan was abandoned in favour of a move to Snape Maltings, the bungalow was built anyway by the architect H. T. Cadbury-Brown, who allowed Holst to live there rent-free.

In 1964 Holst began composing again, and in 1965 accepted commissions for two large-scale works: &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a cantata for female voices, and the &quot;Trianon Suite&quot;, composed for the Trianon Youth Orchestra of Ipswich. In 1965 and 1966 she published two books, studies of Bach and Britten. The latter work caused some shock and surprise by failing to mention the contributions to Britten&#x27;s successes of several key figures in Britten&#x27;s earlier career who had subsequently fallen out of favour, such as his former librettists Eric Crozier and Ronald Duncan. Between 1966 and 1970 Holst recorded a number of her father&#x27;s works with the Purcell Singers and the English Chamber Orchestra, under the Argo and Lyrita labels. Among these recordings was the &quot;Double Violin Concerto&quot;, which she conducted with Emanuel Hurwitz as soloist. Forty years earlier she had acted as the rehearsal pianist before the work&#x27;s first performance.
Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis&#x27;s forty-part motet &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington&#x27;s Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.

On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival&#x27;s new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen&#x27;s performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst&#x27;s brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of &quot;persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor&#x27;s baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst&#x27;s Suite as it has never been played before&quot;.

Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year&#x27;s festival. She made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra&#x27;s inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.

==Later career==
Gustav Holst&#x27;s centenary was celebrated in 1974, when Imogen published a &quot;Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst&#x27;s Music&quot; and founded the Holst Birthplace Museum in Cheltenham. The centenary was the occasion for the publication of the first volume of a facsimile edition of Gustav Holst&#x27;s manuscripts, on which Imogen worked with the help of the composer Colin Matthews. Three more facsimile volumes followed in the years up to 1983, at which point the increasing costs, and Imogen&#x27;s failing health led to the abandonment of the project. As part of the 1974 centenary, she negotiated performances of &quot;Savitri&quot; and &quot;The Wandering Scholar&quot; at Aldeburgh and Sadler&#x27;s Wells, and helped to arrange exhibitions of Gustav Holst&#x27;s life and works at Aldeburgh and the Royal Festival Hall.

Apart from her books concerned with her father&#x27;s life and works, Holst continued to write on other aspects of music. In addition to numerous articles she published a short study of the Renaissance composer William Byrd (1972) and a handbook for conductors of amateur choirs (1973). She continued to compose, usually short pieces but with occasional larger-scale orchestral works such as the &quot;Woodbridge Suite&quot; (1970) and the &quot;Deben Calendar&quot; (1977), the latter a series of twelve sketches depicting the River Deben in Suffolk at different phases of the year. Her last major composition was a String Quintet, written in 1982 and performed in October of that year by the Endellion Quartet, augmented by the cellist Steven Isserlis.

In April 1979 Holst was present when the Queen Mother opened the new Britten–Pears School building in Snape. The building included a new library—the Gustav Holst Library—to which Holst had donated a large amount of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career. She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.

== Death ==
Shortly after the 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Holst became seriously ill with what she described as &quot;a coronary angina&quot;. Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. However, by early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot a few yards away from Britten&#x27;s. An obituary tribute in the magazine &quot;Early Music&quot; emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she &quot;[brought] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder&quot;. Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: &quot;Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her ... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain what most of us need twice that time to do&quot;.

In 2007, Holst&#x27;s centenary was recognised at Aldeburgh by several special events, including a recital in the parish church by the Navarra Quartet in which works by Purcell and Schubert were mixed with Imogen&#x27;s own &quot;The Fall of the Leaf&quot; for solo cello, and the String Quintet. The latter work was described by Andrew Clements in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;genuinely memorable ... The set of variations with which the quintet ends dissolves into a series of bare solo lines, linking Holst&#x27;s music to her father&#x27;s&quot;.

Holst never married, though she enjoyed a number of romantic friendships, notably with the future poet Miles Tomalin, whom she met when she was a pupil at St Paul&#x27;s. The two were close until 1929, and exchanged poetry; Tomalin married in 1931. Many years after the relationship ended, Holst admitted to Britten that she would have married Tomalin.

===Honours===
Holst was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1966. She was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex (1968), Exeter (1969), and Leeds (1983). She was given honorary membership of the Royal Academy of Music in 1970. Holst was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1975 New Year Honours for services to music.

==Music==
Imogen Holst was a part-time composer, intermittently productive within her extensive portfolio of musical activities. In her earlier years she was among a group of young British women composers—Elizabeth Maconchy and Elisabeth Lutyens were others—whose music was regularly performed and broadcast. According to a later critic, her &quot;Mass in A minor&quot; of 1927 showed &quot;confident and imaginative layering of voices, building to a satisfying Agnus Dei&quot;. However, for long periods in her subsequent career Holst barely composed at all. After the RCM, her most active years as a composer were at Dartington in the 1940s and the &quot;post-Britten&quot; period after 1964. Her output of compositions, arrangements and edited music is extensive but has received only limited critical attention. Much of it is unpublished and has usually been neglected after its initial performance.
The oeuvre comprises instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Holst was primarily influenced, as Gustav Holst&#x27;s daughter, by what the analyst Christopher Tinker terms &quot;her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment&quot;, by her close personal relationship with her father, and her love of folksong. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style that emerged in the 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the &quot;Five Songs&quot; (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in &quot;Hallo My Fancy&quot; (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In &quot;Homage to William Morris&quot; (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of dissonance &quot;to add strength to the musical articulation of the text&quot;. By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Holst herself thought made her &quot;a real composer&quot;, is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.

Much of Holst&#x27;s choral music was written for amateur performance. Critics have observed a clear distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women&#x27;s voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer. Record companies were slow in recognising her commercial potential, and not until 2009 was a CD issued devoted entirely to her music—a selection of her works for strings. The &quot;Guardian&quot;″s reviewer welcomed the recording: &quot;[T]here is a great deal of English music of far less worth that is frequently praised to the skies&quot;. In 2012 a selection of her choral music, sung by the Clare College Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi. One review of this recording picks out &quot;Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow&quot;, written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as &quot;[giving] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice&quot;. Another mentions the &quot;Three Psalms&quot; setting, where &quot;inner rhythms are underscored by the subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath&quot;.

<text>The Grenadiers and Rifles Guards Regiment () is a regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army; along with the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene it is one of the two Dutch Guard regiments.

==History==
The two antecedent regiments were formed in 1829 following the withdrawal of the regiments of Swiss mercenaries from Dutch service. Willem I ordered that two regiments would be formed to replace the Swiss, to serve as his guards. Both served with distinction, especially during the Second World War in the defence of The Hague. The regiment was formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of two antecedent regiments, the Garderegiment Grenadiers (Grenadiers Guards Regiment) and the Garderegiment Jagers (Rifles Guards Regiment).

==Organization==
The regiment&#x27;s single battalion currently serves in the airmobile role as part of 11 Luchtmobiele (Airmobile) Brigade. It is organised with an HQ Company (Stafcompagnie), a heavy weapons company (Zwarewapenscompagnie) and three infantry companies (Infanteriecompagnie). The three infantry companies and the anti-tank company perpetuate the two antecedent regiments, with &#x27;A&#x27; (Koningscompagnie) and &#x27;D&#x27; (Wolvencompagnie) companies being classed as Grenadiers and &#x27;B&#x27; (Stiercompagnie) and &#x27;C&#x27; (Tijgercompagnie) Companies being classed as Jagers (Rifles).

The regiment has a museum in Arnhem.

==Bands==
Serving the Guards in musical support, the few numbers of military bands in service, are the Royal Military Band &quot;Johan Willem Friso&quot; and the Traditional Grenadier Bugle Band of the Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles Guard Regiment (Grenadiers) and the Veterans Fanfare band and Bugles and Fanfare orchestra of the Grenadiers and Rifles (Rifles). These are the only bands in service in the Guards units of the RNA as the Band and Corps of Drums of the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene remain disbanded. The present day fanfare brass band (known as the &quot;Regimentsfanfare&quot;) consists of 21 musicians and a permanent conductor. It has existed since 5 September 2005. A brass quintet has existed within the regiment since 2007.

<doc id="1157632" wikidata="Q935293" url="?curid=1157632" title="Purpura">
<text>Purpura () is a condition of red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin secondary to platelet disorders, vascular disorders, coagulation disorders, or other causes. They measure 3–10 mm, whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm.

Purpura is common with typhus and can be present with meningitis caused by meningococci or septicaemia. In particular, meningococcus (&quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;), a Gram-negative diplococcus organism, releases endotoxin when it lyses. Endotoxin activates the Hageman factor (clotting factor XII), which causes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The DIC is what appears as a rash on the affected individual.

==Classification==
Purpura are a common and nonspecific medical sign; however, the underlying mechanism commonly involves one of:
*Platelet disorders (thrombocytopenic purpura)
**Primary thrombocytopenic purpura
**Secondary thrombocytopenic purpura
**Post-transfusion purpura
*Vascular disorders (nonthrombocytopenic purpura)
**Microvascular injury, as seen in senile (old age) purpura, when blood vessels are more easily damaged
**Hypertensive states
**Deficient vascular support
**Vasculitis, as in the case of Henoch–Schönlein purpura
*Coagulation disorders
**Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
**Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) – defect in collagen synthesis due to lack of hydroxylation of procollagen results in weakened capillary walls and cells
*Meningococcemia
*Clumping fibrillary protein deposits caused by Amyloidosis
*Cocaine use with concomitant use of the one-time chemotherapy drug and now veterinary deworming agent levamisole can cause purpura of the ears, face, trunk, or extremities, sometimes needing reconstructive surgery. Levamisole is purportedly a common cutting agent.
*Decomposition of blood vessels including purpura is a symptom of acute radiation poisoning in excess of 2 Grays of radiation exposure. This is an uncommon cause in general, but is commonly seen in victims of nuclear disaster.
Cases of psychogenic purpura are also described in the medical literature, some claimed to be due to &quot;autoerythrocyte sensitization&quot;. Other studies suggest the local (cutaneous) activity of tissue plasminogen activator can be increased in psychogenic purpura, leading to substantial amounts of localized plasmin activity, rapid degradation of fibrin clots, and resultant bleeding. Petechial rash is also characteristic of a rickettsial infection.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;purpura&quot; () comes from Latin &quot;purpura&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, which came from ancient Greek πορφύρα. &quot;Purpura&quot; is a mass noun naming the condition or state, not the name of an individual spot (thus there is no *&quot;purpurum&quot;, *&quot;purpura&quot; or *&quot;purpura&quot;, *&quot;purpurae&quot; count declension).

==See also==
*Bruise, which is a hematoma caused by trauma
*Petechia, which is a small type of hematoma (&lt;3 mm) 
*Ecchymosis, which is a large type of hematoma (&gt;1 cm)
*Purpura secondary to clotting disorders
*Purpura hemorrhagica in horses
*Pigmented purpuric dermatosis
*Schamberg disease (progressive pigmentary purpura)

<text>.si is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Slovenia. It is administered by the ARNES, the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia. In 2010, the registry hosted 80,000 domain names. In 2012, that number increased to 100,000. In 2022 this number crossed 150,000.

==Domain hacks==
Domain hacks for the .si TLD are quite popular, since &quot;si&quot; is second person singular of the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; in Slovene and some other Slavic languages. As such, many domains have been created that are using such domain hacks, one of the most popular being &quot;zadovoljna.si&quot; (&#x27;You are pleased&#x27;, feminine form).

&quot;Sí&quot; also translates from Spanish as &quot;yes,&quot; so the TLD has been used by some Spanish-language websites. A notable example of this is the Mexican political party MORENA, whose website is found at &quot;morena.si&quot;.

Italian party Sinistra Italiana (abbreviation: SI) also uses Slovenian domain for its website (sinistraitaliana.si).

Pepsi uses the URL shortening pep.si.

The video conferencing software Jitsi is hosted on jit.si.

==Risk==
According to research by McAfee performed in 2010, the Slovenian TLD is the tenth most secure.

<text>A petechia (; : petechiae) is a small red or purple spot (≤4 mm in diameter) that can appear on the skin, conjunctiva, retina, and mucous membranes which is caused by haemorrhage of capillaries. The word is derived , of obscure origin. It refers to one of the three descriptive types of hematoma differentiated by size, the other two being ecchymosis (&gt;1cm in diameter) and purpura (4 to 10mm in diameter). The term is typically used in the plural (petechiae), since a single petechia is seldom noticed or significant.

==Causes==
===Physical trauma===

The most common cause of petechiae is through physical trauma such as a hard bout of coughing, holding breath, vomiting, or crying, which can result in facial petechiae, especially around the eyes. Excessive scratching and friction, especially on thin and poorly circulated parts of the body may also cause petechiae. Such instances are generally considered harmless and usually disappear within a few days, but depending on severity and frequency may be indicative of an underlying medical condition.
* Constriction, asphyxiation – petechiae, especially in the eyes, may also occur when excessive pressure is applied to tissue (e.g., when a tourniquet is applied to an extremity or with excessive coughing or vomiting).
* Sunburn, childbirth, weightlifting
* Gua Sha, a Chinese treatment that scrapes the skin
* High-G training
* Hickey
* Asphyxiation
* Choking game
* Oral sex

===Non-infectious conditions===
* Vitamin C deficiency, scurvy
* Vitamin K deficiency
* Leukemia
* Thrombocytopenia – Low platelet counts or diminished platelet function (e.g., as a side effect of medications or during certain infections) can give rise to petechial spots
* clotting factor deficiencies – (Von Willebrand disease)
* Hypocalcemia
* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
* Coeliac disease
* Aplastic anaemia
* Lupus
* Kwashiorkor or Marasmus – Childhood protein-energy malnutrition
* Erythroblastosis fetalis
* Henoch–Schönlein purpura
* Kawasaki disease
* Schamberg disease
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
* Sjögren syndrome – Petechial spots could occur due to vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels. In such a case immediate treatment is needed to prevent permanent damage. Some malignancies can also cause petechiae to appear.
* Radiation
* Fat embolism syndrome

===Infectious conditions===
* Babesiosis
* Bolivian hemorrhagic fever
* Boutonneuse fever
* Chikungunya
* Cerebral malaria
* Congenital syphilis
* Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever
* Cytomegalovirus
* Dengue fever
* Dukes&#x27; disease
* Ebola
* Endocarditis
* Influenza A virus subtype H1N1
* Hantavirus
* Infectious mononucleosis
* Marburg virus
* Neisseria meningitidis
* Rocky Mountain spotted fever
* Scarlet fever
* Typhus
* Streptococcal pharyngitis – Petechiae on the soft palate are mainly associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, and as such it is an uncommon but highly specific finding.

== Forensic science ==
Petechiae on the face and conjunctiva (eyes) are unrelated to asphyxiation or hypoxia. However, the presence of petechiae may be used by police investigators in determining whether strangulation has been part of an attack. The documentation of the presence of petechiae on a victim can help police investigators prove the case. Petechiae resulting from strangulation can be relatively tiny and light in color to very bright and pronounced. Petechiae may be seen on the face, in the whites of the eyes or on the inside of the eyelids.

Shell handled its energy and natural gas trading through its Shell trading brand and its then subsidiary, Coral Energy, LLC, which was a primary marketer of financial and physical power in the western United States (WECC), Texas (ERCOT), and Canada. They were also one of the largest natural gas providers to the western United States, having a very strong retail presence.

In November 2007, Shell announced that it would merge its US-based Coral Energy companies into &quot;Shell Energy North America&quot;. The merge completed in 2008, involved all the Coral companies including Coral Energy Resources, Coral Power, Coral Management and Coral Gas Marketing. Shell Energy North America was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, headquartered in Houston.

== Power plants ==
Coral Energy contracted and built a number of peaker plants and owns the rights to other generation as well. The company&#x27;s plants included:
* Brighton Beach Generating Station (541.3 megawatts), natural gas fired, combined cycle unit
* Wildflower
** Larkspur (90 megawatts), natural gas peaker plants
** Indigo (135 megawatts), natural gas peaker plants
* La Rosita (1,056 megawatts), natural gas fired, combined Cycle unit. 500MW is contracted to CFE.

<doc id="1157638" wikidata="Q7172369" url="?curid=1157638" title="Pete the Pup">
<text>Pete the Pup (September 9, 1929 – January 28, 1946), also called Lucenay&#x27;s Peter, was an american dog actor known to protrait &quot;Pete, the dog with the ring around his eye&quot; in Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies series (later known as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;) during the 1930s. He was well known for having a circled eye added by Hollywood make-up artist Max Factor.

A brief parody of Pete appeared in the 1935 Bob Hope short &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot;, which was produced by Warner Bros.

In his last years Tommy &quot;Butch&quot; Bond made public appearances with a similar Pit Bull Terrier he claimed was a descendant of the original Pete the Pup.

== Dog actors which portrayed the character Pete==
=== Pal The Wonder Dog ===

The first dog actor to play Pete was an UKC registered American Pit Bull Terrier named Pal The Wonder Dog (sired by Tudor&#x27;s Black Jack x Keller Peggy O&#x27;Neill and bred by Earl Tudor) born in 1924, being a descendent to Colby&#x27;s Pincher, and it is claimed to had a natural mark around his right eye (maybe a human eyebrown form spot) and some dye was used to make the circle, credited as an oddity in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot;. 

Pal started out its career as &quot;Tige&quot; in the &quot;Buster Brown&quot; series in the 1920s. It was during this time that he acquired the circled eye mark, and when he was recruited to appear in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies later that year, Hal Roach simply left it on, creating one of the most recognized dogs in film history.

When he was about six months old, Pal the Wonder Dog made an appearance in the Harold Lloyd film &quot;The Freshman&quot;, in 1925.

Pal was poisoned and died in 1930.

=== Lucenay&#x27;s Peter (Pete the pup)===

After Pal&#x27;s death its trainer and owner Lt. Harry Lucenay used one male dog of Pal&#x27;s offspring to play Pete in the series. Pal&#x27;s son named Lucenay&#x27;s Peter (sired by Pal the Wonder Dog x Keller Peggy O&#x27;Neill) was an UKC/AKC dual registered American Pit Bull Terrier/American Staffordshire Terrier named Lucenay’s Peter, mostly known as Pete the Pup, bred by A. A. Keller and born in 1929. This second Pete looked very similar to the first Pete (Pal) but was a mirror image; the circle around Pal&#x27;s right eye was around the left eye of its son Peter. Lucenay&#x27;s Peter first appeared as a puppy on &quot;Pups Is Pups&quot; and was nearly full-grown on his second appearance &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;. The second Pete&#x27;s last &quot;Our Gang&quot; appearance was &quot;The Pooch&quot; in 1932. The plot had a dog catcher who attempts to catch Pete and euthanise him, but is unsuccessful. After Lucenay was fired from the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series in 1932, he retired Peter to Atlantic City, where he was photographed with children at the Steel Pier.

After Harry Lucenays beeing fired, Roach used a number of unrelated dogs to portray Pete in &quot;Our Gang&quot; until 1938 beginning with &quot;Hook and Ladder&quot; (1932). Lucenay&#x27;s Peter continued on and died of old age on January 28, 1946, in Los Angeles, California, at age 16 years/4 months, two years after the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series ended. Pete is buried at Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park at Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California, United States.

=== Other dog actors ===
In the 1994 feature film remake of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, Pete is portraid by an American Bulldog dog actor coincidentally named Petey.

In the 2014 movie &quot;The Little Rascals Save the Day&quot;, Pete is portraid by Jules a female mongrel dog actor wich participated in a 2014 Shelter Pet Project tv commercial.

<text>.hr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Croatia (the country&#x27;s name is &quot;Hrvatska&quot; in the Croatian language).

== Details ==

The .hr domain is administered by CARNET (Croatian Academic and Research Network), via the CARNET DNS Committee which determines policy, and the CARNET DNS Service which handles day-to-day matters. The committee is composed of members generally associated with the academic community. Until 2010, the Service was operated by SRCE; since July 1, 2010 the service operations are divided between CARNET itself, SRCE and a variety of registrars.

Registrants are classified into a number of different groups with different rules about their domain registrations. A requirement of connection to Croatia, such as being a citizen, permanent resident, registered company or EU company with VAT ID evidenced in the VIES system, is common to all of the categories except for the .com.hr. Third level domains (example.com.hr) are allowed to be registered for anyone in the world as long as they provide a local contact.

There are also third-level registrations including of individuals in a few specialized domains such as .iz.hr (.from.hr), and an unlimited number of registrations in .com.hr, but these are unpopular compared to the second-level names registered directly under .hr.

=== Statistics ===
As of March 2017, around 30.33% of all the .hr domains were served via secured HTTPS protocol, with the cPanel, Inc. Certification Authority being the most popular SSL certificate. Apache is the most popular web server, serving 65.93% of the .hr domains, followed by Microsoft-IIS serving 13.23% of the total .hr domains. As of 14 December 2017 at 3PM CET, over 100,000 .hr domain names are registered.

<doc id="1157656" wikidata="Q1784991" url="?curid=1157656" title="Kosmas the Aetolian">
<text>Kosmas the Aetolian, sometimes Cosmas the Aetolian or Patrokosmas &quot;Father Kosmas&quot; (, &quot;Kosmas Etolos&quot;; born between 1700 and 1714 – died 1779), was a monk in the Greek Orthodox Church. He is recognized as one of the originators of the twentieth-century religious movements in Greece. He is also noted for his prophesies. 

Saint Kosmas, the &quot;Equal to the Apostles,&quot; was officially proclaimed a Saint by the Orthodox Church of Constantinople on 20 April 1961 under the tenure of Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras. His feast day is celebrated on 24 August, the date of his martyrdom.
==Life==
Kosmas was born in the Greek village of Mega Dendron near the town of Thermo in the region of Aetolia. He studied Greek and theology before becoming a monk after a trip to Mount Athos, where he also attended the local Theological Academy.

After two years Kosmas left Athos. He studied rhetoric in Constantinople for a time. In 1760 he was authorized by Patriarch Serapheim II (who had marked anti-Ottoman tendencies) to begin missionary tours in the villages of Thrace – later extended to what would form the areas of both West Greece and Northern Greece. The Patriarch had reportedly been worried at the increasing rate of Christians converting to Islam in these areas.

Over sixteen years, Kosmas established many church schools in villages and towns. He called upon Christians to establish schools and learn Biblical Koine Greek, so that they might understand the Scriptures better and generally educate themselves.

After the Orlov Revolt of 1770 in the Peloponnese (which was provoked by the Orlov brothers with the support of Catherine II of the Russian Empire), Kosmas started to preach in what is now Southern Albania, then under the rule of Ahmet Kurt Pasha, governor of the Pashalik of Berat.

His preachings had aroused the opposition of the rich and powerful and others who felt their position threatened, such as the kotsampasides (Greek &quot;village elders&quot; whose power and influence was bound up with Ottoman power).

Kosmas was also viewed with suspicion by officials of the Venetian Republic, then in its final stages of decline, which ruled parts of the territory where he was active. For example, in 1779 he is said to have visited the Venetian-ruled town of Preveza and founded there a Greek school, which would be the only school of the city during the 18th century – an act which the Venetian authorities might have considered as undermining their rule. The Venetians&#x27; suspicions are attested in spy reports about Kosmas preserved in the Venetian archives. In contrast, Kosmas had considerable support from other Christians and even from some Turks.

In his sermons Kosmas often refers negatively to the Jews. Nevertheless, in one of his preachings he stated specifically that: &quot;Those who wrong Christians, &quot;Jews&quot; or Turks (could refer to Muslims in general) would be paid back for the injustice they committed&quot;.

Kosmas held highly negative views on the use of the Aromanian and Albanian (Arvanitika more precisely) languages. He urged Aromanians and Arvanites to stop speaking their language and adopt Greek, which was successful to an extent. Kosmas promised that to those who would vow never to speak Aromanian again, he would intercede with God and ask him to forgive all their sins. He also said that &quot;any village I find with Vlach [Aromanian] language I will curse&quot;. He made the same promise to Arvanites, describing their language as &quot;the language of Satan&quot;.

One effect of his preaching was to transfer the holding of the weekly bazaar (fair) from Sunday to Saturday, which brought economic losses to Jews – barred by their religion from engaging in business on Sabbath. Some researchers believe that for that reason, Jews in Epirus were involved in his conviction by the Ottoman authorities.

Accused of being a Russian agent, he was seized by Ottoman authorities. On 24 August 1779, he was executed at Kolkondas, Fier District, near the mouth of the Seman river (in present-day Albania). There were no formal charges brought against him, nor was he put on trial before being executed – leading to various theories, persisting up to the present, about who might have wanted him dead.

==Legacy==
In 1813, Ali Pasha, the &quot;de facto&quot; independent Muslim Albanian ruler of Ottoman Epirus, southern Albanian and Macedonia, and an enemy of the Sultan, had a church built near the site of Kosmas&#x27; execution, in which the remains of Kosmas were placed.

In 1984, the remains were transferred from the St. Kosmas&#x27; Monastery in Kolkondas, where he was killed, to the Archaeological Museum of Fier. Other relics of the saint are kept in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. Saint Kosmas&#x27; pilgrimage is also revered in some Greek nationalist circles. The latter are associated with the Northern Epirus issue and support the annexation of this region to Greece. Although a hellenizer, Saint Kosmas the Aetolian is still highly regarded by Orthodox Albanians for the message that he gave.

There are numerous popular religious texts attributed to St. Kosmas. Best known are the five &quot;Didaches&quot; and the &quot;Prophecies&quot;. An account stated that he prophesied the unification of Greece and Epirus. There survives, however, no original manuscript of these texts written personally by St. Kosmas, and none can be dated with certainty. His writings are known only from second- or third-hand transcriptions. It is believed that these texts are based on Kosmas&#x27; preachings but were written and copied mostly after his death.

<text>Henry Ring (born March 16, 1977, in Franklin, Tennessee) is a retired soccer goalkeeper, who last played for the Chicago Fire in Major League Soccer.

Ring attended the University of South Carolina where he played for the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1997 to 2000. He was a third team All American both seasons. During his collegiate career, he spent one season with the Central Jersey Riptide in the Premier Development League in 1999.

In February 2001, the Chicago Fire selected Ring in the third round of the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. He saw no time his first season with the team, and only played in one league game each of the following two years. In 2002, the Fire sent Ring on loan to the Milwaukee Rampage for one game. In 2003, he went on loan to the Rochester Rhinos as back up to Bill Andracki. In 2004, he played in 28 league games, recording seven shutouts and starting for the East in the MLS All-Star Game. In the offseason, after Chicago welcomed back Zach Thornton and gave him back his old starting spot without a competition, Ring was traded to F.C. Dallas for a draft pick. However, Ring chose not to sign with Dallas, and after an unsuccessful bid at winning the outright starting job with the MetroStars, Ring retired.

<text>The pulp is the connective tissue, nerves, blood vessels, and odontoblasts that comprise the innermost layer of a tooth. The pulp&#x27;s activity and signalling processes regulate its behaviour.

== Anatomy ==
The pulp is the neurovascular bundle central to each tooth, permanent or primary. It is composed of a central pulp chamber, pulp horns, and radicular canals. The large mass of the pulp is contained within the pulp chamber, which is contained in and mimics the overall shape of the crown of the tooth. Because of the continuous deposition of the dentine, the pulp chamber becomes smaller with the age. This is not uniform throughout the coronal pulp but progresses faster on the floor than on the roof or sidewalls.

Radicular pulp canals extend down from the cervical region of the crown to the root apex. They are not always straight but vary in shape, size, and number. They are continuous with the periapical tissues through the apical foramen or foramina.

The total volume of all the permanent teeth organs is 0.38cc, and the mean volume of a single adult human pulp is 0.02cc.

Accessory canals are pathways from the radicular pulp. These canals, which extend laterally through the dentin to the periodontal tissue, are seen especially in the apical third of the root. Accessory canals are also called &quot;lateral canals&quot; because they are usually located on the lateral surface of the roots of the teeth.

== Development ==
The pulp has a background similar to that of dentin because both are derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ. During odontogenesis, when the dentin forms around the dental papilla, the innermost tissue is considered pulp.

There are 4 main stages of tooth development:

# Bud stage
# Cap stage
# Bell stage
# Crown stage

The first sign of tooth development is known to be as early as the 6th week of intrauterine life. The oral epithelium begins to multiply and invaginates into ectomesenchyme cells, which gives rise to dental lamina. The dental lamina is the origin of the tooth bud. The bud stage progresses to the cap stage when the epithelium forms the enamel organ. The ectomesenchyme cells condense further and become dental papilla. Together the epithelial enamel organ and ectomesenchymal dental papilla and follicle form the tooth germ. The dental papilla is the origin of dental pulp. Cells at the periphery of the dental papilla undergo cell division and differentiation to become odontoblasts. Pulpoblasts form in the middle of the pulp. This completes the formation of the pulp. The dental pulp is essentially a mature dental papilla.

The development of dental pulp can also be split into two stages: coronal pulp development (near the crown of the tooth) and root pulp development (apex of the tooth).

The pulp develops in four regions from the periphery to the central pulp:

# Odontoblast layer
# Cell-free zone – likely to be an artefact
# Cell-rich zone
# Pulp core

== Internal structure ==
The central region of the coronal and radicular pulp contains large nerve trunks and blood vessels.

This area is lined peripherally by a specialized odontogenic area which has four layers (from innermost to outermost):

#Pulpal core, which is in the center of the pulp chamber, with many cells and an extensive vascular supply; except for its location, it is very similar to the cell-rich zone.
# Cell-rich zone, which contains fibroblasts and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.
#Cell-free zone (zone of Weil, which is rich in both capillaries and nerve networks.
#Odontoblastic layer, the outermost layer which contains odontoblasts and lies next to the predentin and mature dentin.

Cells found in the dental pulp include fibroblasts (the principal cell), odontoblasts, defence cells like histiocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, and plasma cells. The nerve plexus of Raschkow is located central to the cell-rich zone.

=== The plexus of Raschkow ===
The plexus of Raschkow monitors painful sensations. By virtue of their peptide content, they also play important functions in inflammatory events and subsequent tissue repair. There are two types of nerve fibers that mediate the sensation of pain: A-Fibres conduct rapid and sharp pain sensations and belong to the myelinated group, whereas C-Fibres are involved in dull aching pain and are thinner and unmyelinated. The A-Fibres, mainly of the A-delta type, are preferentially located in the periphery of the pulp, where they are in close association with the odontoblasts and extend fibers to many but not all dentinal tubules. The C-Fibres typically terminate in the pulp tissue proper, either as free nerve endings or as branches around blood vessels. Sensory nerve fibers that originate from inferior and superior alveolar nerves innervate the odontoblastic layer of the pulp cavity. These nerves enter the tooth through the apical foramen as myelinated nerve bundles. They branch to form the subodontoblastic nerve plexus of Raschkow, which is separated from the odontoblasts by a cell-free zone of Weil. This plexus lies between the cell-free and cell-rich zones of the pulp.
=== Pulp innervation ===
As the dental pulp is a highly vascularised and innervated region of the tooth, it is the site of origin for most pain-related sensations. The dental pulp nerve is innervated by one of the trigeminal nerves, otherwise known as the &quot;fifth cranial nerve&quot;. The neurons enter the pulp cavity through the apical foramen and branch off to form the nerve plexus of Raschkow. Nerves from the plexus of Raschkow provide branches to form a marginal plexus around the odontoblasts, with some nerves penetrating the dentinal tubules.

The dental pulp is also innervated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These sympathetic axons project into the radicular pulp, where they form a plexus along the blood vessels. Their function is mainly related to blood vessel constriction within the dental pulp. A sharp fall in pulpal blood flow may be caused by stimulation of these nerves. There is no evidence for a parasympathetic pulpal innervation.

There are two main types of sensory nerve fibres in the pulp, each densely placed at different locations. The differing structural features of the two sensory nerve fibres also result in different types of sensory stimulation.

* Myelinated A-Fibres:
** The A-Fibres present in the pulp can be further classified into 2 different types. A-Delta Fibres make up 90% of the A-Fibres, while the rest are A-Beta Fibres.
** Have a relatively low-threshold sensory apparatus.
** Mainly located at the pulp-dentine border at the top of the pulp, and more specifically concentrated in the pulp horn.
** Have a relatively small diameter with a relatively slow conduction velocity. They are is still faster than C-Fibres.
** A-Fibres transmit signals to the brainstem and then to the contralateral thalamus.
** Able to respond to stimuli through a shell of calcified tissue due to the stimulus-induced fluid flow in dentinal tubules. This is known as the &quot;hydrodynamic theory&quot;. Stimuli that displaces the fluid within the dentinal tubules will trigger the intradental myelinated A-Fibres, leading to the sharp pain sensation commonly associated with dentine hypersensitivity
* Unmyelinated C-Fibres:
** They are mainly located at the core of the pulp and extend underneath the odontoblastic layer.
** C-Fibres have higher pain thresholds, responsible for detecting inflammatory threats.
** They are heavily influenced by modulating interneurons before they reach the thalamus. C-Fibre stimulation often results in a &quot;slow pain&quot;, normally characterised as a dull and aching pain.

== Functions ==
The primary function of the dental pulp is to form dentin (by the odontoblasts).

Other functions include:
* Nutritive: the pulp keeps the organic components of the surrounding mineralized tissue supplied with moisture and nutrients;
* Protective/sensory: extremes in temperature, pressure, or trauma to the dentin or pulp are perceived as pain;
* Defensive/reparative: the formation of reparative or tertiary dentin (by the odontoblasts);
* Formative: cells of the pulp produce dentin which surrounds and protects the pulpal tissue.

== Pulp testing ==
The health of the dental pulp can be established by a variety of diagnostic aids which test either the blood supply to a tooth (&quot;Vitality Test&quot;) or the sensory response of the nerves within the root canal to specific stimuli (&quot;Sensitivity Test&quot;). Although less accurate, sensitivity tests, such as Electric Pulp Tests or Thermal Tests, are more routinely used in clinical practice than vitality testing, which requires specialised equipment.

A healthy tooth is expected to respond to sensitivity testing with a short, sharp burst of pain which subsides when the stimulus is removed. An exaggerated or prolonged response to sensitivity testing indicates that the tooth has some degree of symptomatic pulpitis. A tooth that does not respond at all to sensitivity testing may have become necrotic.

== Pulp diagnoses ==
=== Normal pulp ===
In a healthy tooth, enamel and dentin layers protect the pulp from infection.

=== Reversible pulpitis ===
Reversible pulpitis is a mild to moderate inflammation caused by any momentary irritation or stimulant whereby no pain is felt upon the stimulants&#x27; removal. The pulp swells when the protective layers of enamel and dentine are compromised. Unlike irreversible pulpitis, the pulp gives a regular response to sensibility tests and inflammation resolves with management of the cause. No significant radiographic changes are present in the periapical region. Further examination is required to ensure that the dental pulp has returned to its normal state.

==== Common causes ====
* Bacterial infection from caries
* Thermal shock
* Trauma
* Excessive dehydration of a cavity during restoration
* Irritation of exposed dentine
* Repetitive trauma caused by bruxism or jaw misalignment
* Fractured tooth exposing pulp

==== Symptoms ====
* Temporary post-restoration sensitivity
* Non-spontaneous and milder pain compared to irreversible pulpitis
* Short sharp pain caused by a stimulant

==== Differential diagnosis ====
* X-rays to determine extent of decay and inflammation
* Sensitivity tests to see if pain/discomfort is experienced when tooth is in contact with hot, cold or sweet stimuli
* Tooth tap test (lightweight, blunt instrument gently tapped onto affected tooth to determine extent of inflammation)
* Electric pulp test

==== Treatment ====
* Treatment should resolve reversible pulpitis; early treating may help prevent irreversible pulpitis
* Follow-up required to determine whether the reversible pulpitis has returned to a normal status

==== Prevention ====
* Regular check-ups
* When preparing cavities, dehydrate with sufficient alcohol/chloroform and apply sufficient varnish to protect the pulp

=== Irreversible pulpitis ===
Pulpitis is established when the pulp chamber is compromised by bacterial infection. Irreversible pulpitis is diagnosed when the pulp is inflamed and infected beyond healing. Removal of the aetiological agent does not permit healing, and a root canal is often indicated. Irreversible pulpitis follows reversible pulpitis absent early intervention. While the pulp is still vital and vascularised, it is not classified as &#x27;dead pulp&#x27;.

Irreversible and reversible pulpitis are distinguished by the pain responses to thermal stimulation. If the condition is reversible, the pulp&#x27;s pain response lasts a few seconds upon exposure to cold or hot. If the pain lingers from minutes to hours, the condition is classified as irreversible. This is a common presenting complaint that facilitates initial diagnosis.

Irreversible puplitis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis results from transition of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis into an inactive/quiescent state. This is due to its aetiology; inflammatory exudate can be quickly removed, e.g. through a large carious cavity or previous trauma that caused painless pulp exposure. The build-up of pressure in a confined pulp space initiates pain reflexes. When this pressure is relieved, pain subsides.

As the names imply, these diseases are largely characterised by their symptoms: pain duration and location, and exacerbating and relieving factors. Inputs include clinical tests (cold ethyl chloride, EPT, hot-gutta percha, palpation), radiographic analysis (peri-apical and/or cone-beam computed tomography) and others. Thermal tests are subjective, and are therefore performed the compromised tooth and the adjacent and contralateral teeth, allowing the patient to compare them. Normal healthy teeth are used as a baseline for diagnoses.

Key characteristics of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis include:

* Spontaneous and unpredictable pain at any time, and specific causal factors cannot be identified
* Patient may complain of sharp lingering pains that last longer than 30 seconds, even after removal of stimulus
* Possible referred pain
* Pain may increase with changes of posture, e.g. from lying down to standing.
* Analgesics tend to be ineffective.
* No pain on percussion because the bacteria are not present in the peri-apical region.

Key characteristics of asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis include:

* No clinical symptoms.
* Pulp will respond to sensitiviity tests as a healthy pulp would.

Treatments include root canal or tooth extraction. In endodontic therapy, removal of the inflamed pulp relieves the pain. The empty root canal system is then obturated with gutta-percha (rubber material that acts as a pressure/pain reliever).

=== Pulp necrosis ===
Pulp necrosis is when the pulp has died/dying. Causes include untreated caries, trauma or bacterial infection. It is often subsequent to chronic pulpitis. Teeth with pulp necrosis undergo a root canal or extraction to prevent further spread of the infection, which may lead to an abscess.

==== Symptoms ====
Necrosis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic necrosis involves lingering pain response to hot and cold stimuli, spontaneous pain that may cause a patient to awaken during sleep, difficulty eating and sensitivity to percussion. Asymptomatic necrosis is non-responsive to thermal stimuli or electric pulp tests, leaving the patient unaware of the pathology.

==== Diagnosis ====
Asymptomatic necrosis is may go unnoticed by the patient and so a diagnosis may not be attempted. Diagnosis may involve X-rays and sensitivity testing with. hot or cold stimuli (using warm gutta-percha or ethyl chloride), or an electric pulp tester. Tooth vitality (blood supply) may be assessed using doppler flowmetry. Sequelae of a necrotic pulp include acute apical periodontitis, dental abscess, or radicular cyst and tooth discolouration.

==== Prognosis and treatment ====
Untreated necrotic pulp may result in further complications, such as infection, fever, swelling, abscesses and bone loss. Two treatment options are available for pulpal necrosis.

=== Pulp response to caries ===
Pulpal response to caries can be divided into two stages – pre- and post-infection. In caries-affected human teeth, odontoblast-like cells appear at the dentine-pulp interface along with specialized pulp immune cells to combat caries. Once they identify specific bacterial components, these cells activate innate and adaptive immunity.

In uninfected pulp, leukocytes can sample and respond to the environment, involving macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells and B cells. This sampling process is part of the normal immune response, as it triggers leukocytes from the circulatory system to adhere to endothelial cells lining blood vessels and then migrates to the site of infection for defence. Macrophages can phagocytose bacteria and activate T cells, triggering the adaptive immune response that occurs in association with DCs. In the pulp, DCs secrete a range of cytokines that influence immune responses, and are key regulators of the infection defence. A comparatively small number of B cells are present in healthy pulp tissue, and pulpitis and caries progression increase their numbers.

When bacteria get closer to the pulp but are still confined to primary or secondary dentine, acid demineralization of dentine occurs, producing tertiary dentine to help protect the pulp from further injury.

After a pulp exposure, pulp cells are recruited and differentiate into odontoblast-like cells, contributing to the formation of a dentine bridge, increasing dentin thickness. The odontoblast-like cell is a mineralized structure formed by a new population of pulp-derived cells that can be expressed as Toll-like receptors. They are responsible for the upregulation of innate immunity effectors, including antimicrobial agents and chemokines. One important antimicrobial agent produced by odontoblasts is beta-defensins (BDs). BDs kill microorganisms by forming micropores that destroy membrane integrity and cause leakage of the cell content. Another is nitric oxide (NO), a highly diffusible free radical that stimulates chemokine production to attract immune cells to the affected areas and neutralize bacterial by-products in pulp cells &quot;in vitro&quot;.

=== Pulp stones ===
Pulp stones are calcified masses that occur in the pulp, either in the apical or coronal portions. They are classified according to their structure or location. According to their location, pulp stones can be classed either as free (completely surrounded by pulp), embedded (surrounded by dentine tissue) or adherent (attached to pulp wall continuous with dentine, but not fully enclosed). Depending on the structure, they are either true (dentine lined by odontoblasts), false (formed from degenerating cells that mineralise) or diffuse (more irregular in shape to false stones). The aetiology of pulp stones is little understood. It has been recorded that pulpal calcifications can occur due to:

* Pulp degeneration
* Increasing age
* Orthodontic treatment
* Traumatic occlusion
* Dental caries

Pulp stones usually consist of circular layers of mineralised tissues. These layers are made up of blood clots, dead cells and collagen fibres. Occasionally, pulp stones appear surrounded by odontoblast-like cells that contain tubules.

Pulp stones can reach as high as 50% in surveyed samples. Pulp stones are estimated to typically range from 8–9%. Pulpal calcifications are more common in females and more frequent in maxillary teeth compared to mandibular teeth. The reason is uncertain. They are more common in molar teeth, especially first molars compared to second molars and premolars. A review suggested this was because the first molars are the first teeth to be located in the mandible (lower jaw) and have longer exposure to degenerative changes. They also have a larger blood supply.

In general, pulp stones do not require treatment. Depending on the stones&#x27; size and location, they may interfere with endodontic treatment and should be removed.

=== Complications ===
Pulp acts as a security and alarm system. Slight decay in tooth structure not extending to the dentin may not alarm the pulp, but as the dentin gets exposed, due either to dental caries or trauma, sensitivity starts. The dentinal tubules pass the stimulus to the pulp&#x27;s odontoblastic layer, triggering the response. This mainly responds to cold. At this stage, simple restoration can be performed. As the decay progresses near the pulp, the response magnifies. Sensation to heat and cold increases. At this stage, indirect pulp capping may be advisable. At this stage it may be impossible to clinically diagnose the extent of decay. Carious dentin by dental decay progressing to the pulp may get fractured during mastication, traumatizing the pulp, resulting in pulpitis.
Pulpitis can be painful and may call for root canal therapy or endodontic therapy. Traumatized pulp starts an inflammatory response. The hard and closed surroundings builds pressure inside the pulp chamber, compressing the nerve fibres and eliciting pain. At this stage, the pulp starts to die, progressing to periapical abscess formation (chronic pulpitis).

Pulp horns recede with age. The pulp undergoes a decrease in intercellular substance, water, and cells as it fills with collagen fibers. This decrease in cells is evident in the reduced number of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The pulp becomes more fibrotic, reducing the regenerative capacity of the pulp due to the loss of these cells. The overall pulp cavity may become smaller by the addition of secondary or tertiary dentin and cause pulp recession. The lack of sensitivity associated with older teeth is due to receded pulp horns, pulp fibrosis, the addition of dentin, or all these changes. Restorative treatment can be performed without local anaesthesia on older dentitions.

== History ==
The Roman anatomist Galen commented on Hippocrates&#x27; work, classifying teeth as bones, noting their distinct characteristics compared to other bones. He was the first to discover nerves in teeth and identified seven cranial nerves in his research.

<doc id="1157674" wikidata="Q9393074" url="?curid=1157674" title="Sindhology">
<text>Sindhology () is a field of South Asian studies and academic research that covers the history, society, culture, literature and people of Sindh, Pakistan. The subject was first brought into the academic circles with the establishment of the Institute of Sindhology at Sindh University in 1964. Since then, it has developed into a discipline that covers the aspects of history and archaeology from the Indus Valley civilization to the modern Sindhi society. The subject has also received wider attention at international levels. An academic or expert who specialises in Sindhology is called a Sindhologist.

== History ==

The term &quot;Sindhology&quot; to denote a subject of knowledge about Sindh was first coined in 1964 with the establishment of the Institute of Sindhology. The objective at the time was to promote the study and broader research on Sindh, and develop a repository of archives, books, manuscripts, and research papers. Another wider objective was to promote the knowledge about Sindh in various other national and regional languages of Pakistan, as well as international languages such as Arabic, English, Persian and Urdu.

The subject was actually developed on the patterns of Egyptology and Indology. The study area encompassed the multidisciplinary research about the land that has been shaped by the 5000 years old Indus Valley civilization as well as the Indus River (locally known as &quot;Sindhu Darya&quot;). This enables the scope of the study to cover the antiquities, relics, culture, traditions, and literature with unique forms of music, art, and poetry that has prevailed in both the ancient and modern Sindh.

== Organisations ==

<doc id="1157675" wikidata="Q1347494" url="?curid=1157675" title="Hirono, Iwate">
<text>is a town located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 14,906 in 6790 households, and a population density of 49 persons per km² in 6,858 households. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Hirono is located in far northeastern Iwate Prefecture, bordered by Aomori Prefecture to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Aomori Prefecture
*Hashikami
Iwate Prefecture
*Karumai
*Kuji

===Climate===
Hirono has a humid oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Hirono is 9.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1168 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around -2.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirono has declined over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Hirono was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and was dominated by the Nambu clan from the Muromachi period. During the Edo period, the area was part of Hachinohe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. In the early Meiji period, the villages of Taneichi, Nakano and Ōno within Kita-Kunohe District were created on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kita-Kunohe District and Minami-Kunohe Districts merged to form Kunohe District on April 1, 1897. Taneichi was raised to town status on April 1, 1951, annexing the village of Nakano on February 11, 1955. Taneichi merged with Ōno on January 1, 2006 and was renamed Hirono. The new name, combining characters for &quot;ocean&quot; (洋) and &quot;fields&quot; (野), reflected the combination of coastal Taneichi with inland Ōno. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami severely damaged local fishing ports and destroyed some houses in coastal areas, but the center of the town was protected by a embankment, and the town suffered no casualties in the disaster.

==Government==
Hirono has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Hirono, collectively with the city of Kuji and town of Noda, contributes two members to the Iwate Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Hirono is within the economic sphere of nearby Hachinohe, Aomori. The local economy is based on commercial fishing and to a lesser extent on agriculture (shiitake, spinach and rice).

==Education==
Hirono has seven public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the town government, and two public high schools operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
 East Japan Railway Company (JR East) - Hachinohe Line

===Highway===
*

==Local attractions==
*Symboli Ranch, specializing in race horses

===Local specialties===
Taneichi takes pride in its sea urchins. It is common in restaurants and has its own yearly festival in July, the Taneichi Sea Urchin Festival. Some of the sea urchins are harvested by means of Nanbu diving (南部もぐり), which is taught in a special program at Taneichi Senior High School. Sea pineapples (class Ascidiacea) are also harvested in Taneichi. Ōno takes pride in its various dairy products.

==Notable people from Hirono==
*Ishinosuke Uwano – former Imperial Japanese Army soldier
*Kentaro Kudo – politician

<doc id="1157685" wikidata="Q7488" url="?curid=1157685" title="Emperor Qinzong">
<text>Emperor Qinzong of Song (23 May 1100 – 14 June 1161), personal name Zhao Huan, was the ninth emperor of the Song dynasty of China and the last emperor of the Northern Song dynasty.

Emperor Qinzong was the eldest son and heir apparent of Emperor Huizong. His mother was Emperor Huizong&#x27;s empress consort, Empress Wang. In 1126, when the forces of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty invaded the Northern Song dynasty beginning the first siege of Bianjing. Frightened, Emperor Huizong intended to flee but was convinced by his officials to abdicate first and then flee. Huizong then abdicated and passed on his throne to Emperor Qinzong, and then assumed the title &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (&quot;Retired Emperor&quot;) himself and fled to the countryside. After the fall of Kaifeng that marked the end of the Northern Song and Qinzong and his father&#x27;s subsequent capture by the Jin forces, they, along and his half-brother and their successor, Emperor Gaozong, were blamed for the Song dynasty&#x27;s decline.

== Reign ==
Left to deal with the Jin invasion by himself, Emperor Qinzong appointed the general Li Gang () to lead the Song military to fend off the invaders. However, Emperor Qinzong was not a decisive leader and often made poor judgments. Eventually, he removed Li Gang from his appointment in the hope of starting peace talks with the Jin Empire and sent his younger brother Zhao Gou to negotiate but he was captured and ransomed. This may contribute to Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s decision to not rescue Qinzong. The first siege of Bianjing ended after Qinzong gave a city to the Jurchens and paid them annual tribute. Emperor Huizong returned after hearing that the siege was over.

=== Causes of the Second Siege of Bianjing ===
Despite this, almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful. Emperor Qinzong rejected a proposal to reinforce the northern borders reasoning that they may never come back and sent his generals to other parts of the country. The Jin imperial court sent two ambassadors to Song. The two ambassadors were nobles from the former Liao dynasty. Emperor Qinzong misjudged the situation and believed that they could be used to turn against the Jin ruler, Emperor Taizong. Emperor Qinzong sent a coded letter which was sealed in candle wax, inviting them to join Song to form an Anti–Jin alliance but the ambassadors handed the letter to Emperor Taizong and in retaliation, accused Emperor Qinzong for violating the peace treaty and sent an even bigger army against the Song.

== Capture ==

Since Qinzong mistakenly removed the army to post in different parts of the country, the Jin forces eventually breached the walls of the Song capital, Bianjing, in 1127 and occupied the city in an event historically known as the Jingkang Incident (&quot;Jingkang&quot; was the era name of Emperor Qinzong.) Emperor Qinzong, along with his father Emperor Huizong and the rest of their family, were taken prisoner by Jin forces, marking the end of the Northern Song. Qinzong&#x27;s brother Zhao Gou managed to escape to southern China, where he reestablished the empire as the Southern Song dynasty and became historically known as Emperor Gaozong.

=== Life in the Jin Dynasty ===
Emperor Qinzong and his father were demoted to the status of commoners on 20 March 1127 and deported to Huining Prefecture, the Jin capital, on 13 May 1127. In 1128, the two former Song emperors were forced to wear mourning dresses and pay homage to the ancestors of the Jin Emperors at their ancestral temple in Huining Prefecture. Furthermore, the Jurchen ruler, Emperor Taizong, gave the two former Song emperors contemptuous titles to humiliate them: Emperor Qinzong was called &quot;Marquis Chonghun&quot; (重昏侯; literally &quot;Doubly Muddle-headed Marquis&quot;) while Emperor Huizong was called &quot;Duke Hunde&quot; (昏德公; literally &quot;Muddle-headed Duke&quot;).

In 1141, as the Jin Empire normalised relations with the (Southern) Song Empire, the Jurchens renamed Emperor Qinzong&#x27;s title to the more neutral-sounding &quot;Duke of Tianshui Commandery&quot; (), which is based on a commandery located in the upper reaches of the Wei River. A few months later, the former emperor started receiving a stipend due to his nobility status. He lived the rest of his life as a captive in the Jin Empire, which used him as a hostage to put pressure on the Song Empire.

In 1142, Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing which made peace with the Jin Dynasty. This destroyed Qinzong&#x27;s chance of returning.

In 1156, in an act of humiliation, the Jin Emperor who at the time was the Prince of Hailing ordered him and the former Emperor Tianzuo of Liao to compete in a match of polo. Emperor Qinzong was weak and frail, thus quickly fell off the horse. Emperor Tianzuo himself despite being very old, was more familiar to horse riding, tried to escape but was shot to death by Jurchen archers.

Emperor Qinzong died as a sick and broken man in 1161 having spent two-thirds of his life in the Jin Dynasty. He was 61. His temple name means &quot;Venerate Ancestor&quot;.

<doc id="1157698" wikidata="Q2460595" url="?curid=1157698" title="Transcendental number theory">
<text>Transcendental number theory is a branch of number theory that investigates transcendental numbers (numbers that are not solutions of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients), in both qualitative and quantitative ways.

==Transcendence==
The fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that if we have a non-constant polynomial with rational coefficients (or equivalently, by clearing denominators, with integer coefficients) then that polynomial will have a root in the complex numbers. That is, for any non-constant polynomial formula_1 with rational coefficients there will be a complex number formula_2 such that formula_3. Transcendence theory is concerned with the converse question: given a complex number formula_2, is there a polynomial formula_1 with rational coefficients such that formula_6 If no such polynomial exists then the number is called transcendental.

More generally the theory deals with algebraic independence of numbers. A set of numbers {α1, α2, …, α&quot;n&quot;} is called algebraically independent over a field &quot;K&quot; if there is no non-zero polynomial &quot;P&quot; in &quot;n&quot; variables with coefficients in &quot;K&quot; such that &quot;P&quot;(α1, α2, …, α&quot;n&quot;) = 0. So working out if a given number is transcendental is really a special case of algebraic independence where &quot;n&quot; = 1 and the field &quot;K&quot; is the field of rational numbers.

A related notion is whether there is a closed-form expression for a number, including exponentials and logarithms as well as algebraic operations. There are various definitions of &quot;closed-form&quot;, and questions about closed-form can often be reduced to questions about transcendence.

==History==
===Approximation by rational numbers: Liouville to Roth===

Use of the term &quot;transcendental&quot; to refer to an object that is not algebraic dates back to the seventeenth century, when Gottfried Leibniz proved that the sine function was not an algebraic function. The question of whether certain classes of numbers could be transcendental dates back to 1748 when Euler asserted that the number log&quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot; was not algebraic for rational numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; provided &quot;b&quot; is not of the form &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;c&quot; for some rational &quot;c&quot;.

Euler&#x27;s assertion was not proved until the twentieth century, but almost a hundred years after his claim Joseph Liouville did manage to prove the existence of numbers that are not algebraic, something that until then had not been known for sure. His original papers on the matter in the 1840s sketched out arguments using simple continued fractions to construct transcendental numbers. Later, in the 1850s, he gave a necessary condition for a number to be algebraic, and thus a sufficient condition for a number to be transcendental. This transcendence criterion was not strong enough to be necessary too, and indeed it fails to detect that the number &quot;e&quot; is transcendental. But his work did provide a larger class of transcendental numbers, now known as Liouville numbers in his honour.

Liouville&#x27;s criterion essentially said that algebraic numbers cannot be very well approximated by rational numbers. So if a number can be very well approximated by rational numbers then it must be transcendental. The exact meaning of &quot;very well approximated&quot; in Liouville&#x27;s work relates to a certain exponent. He showed that if α is an algebraic number of degree &quot;d&quot; ≥ 2 and ε is any number greater than zero, then the expression
:formula_7
can be satisfied by only finitely many rational numbers &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;. Using this as a criterion for transcendence is not trivial, as one must check whether there are infinitely many solutions &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; for every &quot;d&quot; ≥ 2.

In the twentieth century work by Axel Thue, Carl Siegel, and Klaus Roth reduced the exponent in Liouville&#x27;s work from &quot;d&quot; + ε to &quot;d&quot;/2 + 1 + ε, and finally, in 1955, to 2 + ε. This result, known as the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem, is ostensibly the best possible, since if the exponent 2 + ε is replaced by just 2 then the result is no longer true. However, Serge Lang conjectured an improvement of Roth&#x27;s result; in particular he conjectured that &quot;q&quot;2+ε in the denominator of the right-hand side could be reduced to formula_8.

Roth&#x27;s work effectively ended the work started by Liouville, and his theorem allowed mathematicians to prove the transcendence of many more numbers, such as the Champernowne constant. The theorem is still not strong enough to detect &quot;all&quot; transcendental numbers, though, and many famous constants including &quot;e&quot; and π either are not or are not known to be very well approximable in the above sense.

===Auxiliary functions: Hermite to Baker===
Fortunately other methods were pioneered in the nineteenth century to deal with the algebraic properties of &quot;e&quot;, and consequently of π through Euler&#x27;s identity. This work centred on use of the so-called auxiliary function. These are functions which typically have many zeros at the points under consideration. Here &quot;many zeros&quot; may mean many distinct zeros, or as few as one zero but with a high multiplicity, or even many zeros all with high multiplicity. Charles Hermite used auxiliary functions that approximated the functions formula_9 for each natural number formula_10 in order to prove the transcendence of formula_11 in 1873. His work was built upon by Ferdinand von Lindemann in the 1880s in order to prove that &quot;e&quot;α is transcendental for nonzero algebraic numbers α. In particular this proved that π is transcendental since &quot;e&quot;π&quot;i&quot; is algebraic, and thus answered in the negative the problem of antiquity as to whether it was possible to square the circle. Karl Weierstrass developed their work yet further and eventually proved the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem in 1885.

In 1900 David Hilbert posed his famous collection of problems. The seventh of these, and one of the hardest in Hilbert&#x27;s estimation, asked about the transcendence of numbers of the form &quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are algebraic, &quot;a&quot; is not zero or one, and &quot;b&quot; is irrational. In the 1930s Alexander Gelfond and Theodor Schneider proved that all such numbers were indeed transcendental using a non-explicit auxiliary function whose existence was granted by Siegel&#x27;s lemma. This result, the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, proved the transcendence of numbers such as &quot;e&quot;π and the Gelfond–Schneider constant.

The next big result in this field occurred in the 1960s, when Alan Baker made progress on a problem posed by Gelfond on linear forms in logarithms. Gelfond himself had managed to find a non-trivial lower bound for the quantity
:formula_12
where all four unknowns are algebraic, the αs being neither zero nor one and the βs being irrational. Finding similar lower bounds for the sum of three or more logarithms had eluded Gelfond, though. The proof of Baker&#x27;s theorem contained such bounds, solving Gauss&#x27; class number problem for class number one in the process. This work won Baker the Fields medal for its uses in solving Diophantine equations. From a purely transcendental number theoretic viewpoint, Baker had proved that if α1, ..., α&quot;n&quot; are algebraic numbers, none of them zero or one, and β1, ..., β&quot;n&quot; are algebraic numbers such that 1, β1, ..., β&quot;n&quot; are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then the number
:formula_13
is transcendental.

===Other techniques: Cantor and Zilber===

In the 1870s, Georg Cantor started to develop set theory and, in 1874, published a paper proving that the algebraic numbers could be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers, and thus that the set of transcendental numbers must be uncountable. Later, in 1891, Cantor used his more familiar diagonal argument to prove the same result. While Cantor&#x27;s result is often quoted as being purely existential and thus unusable for constructing a single transcendental number, the proofs in both the aforementioned papers give methods to construct transcendental numbers.

While Cantor used set theory to prove the plenitude of transcendental numbers, a recent development has been the use of model theory in attempts to prove an unsolved problem in transcendental number theory. The problem is to determine the transcendence degree of the field
:formula_14
for complex numbers &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; that are linearly independent over the rational numbers. Stephen Schanuel conjectured that the answer is at least &quot;n&quot;, but no proof is known. In 2004, though, Boris Zilber published a paper that used model theoretic techniques to create a structure that behaves very much like the complex numbers equipped with the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Moreover, in this abstract structure Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture does indeed hold. Unfortunately it is not yet known that this structure is in fact the same as the complex numbers with the operations mentioned; there could exist some other abstract structure that behaves very similarly to the complex numbers but where Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture doesn&#x27;t hold. Zilber did provide several criteria that would prove the structure in question was C, but could not prove the so-called Strong Exponential Closure axiom. The simplest case of this axiom has since been proved, but a proof that it holds in full generality is required to complete the proof of the conjecture.

==Approaches==

A typical problem in this area of mathematics is to work out whether a given number is transcendental. Cantor used a cardinality argument to show that there are only countably many algebraic numbers, and hence almost all numbers are transcendental. Transcendental numbers therefore represent the typical case; even so, it may be extremely difficult to prove that a given number is transcendental (or even simply irrational).

For this reason transcendence theory often works towards a more quantitative approach. So given a particular complex number α one can ask how close α is to being an algebraic number. For example, if one supposes that the number α is algebraic then can one show that it must have very high degree or a minimum polynomial with very large coefficients? Ultimately if it is possible to show that no finite degree or size of coefficient is sufficient then the number must be transcendental. Since a number α is transcendental if and only if &quot;P&quot;(α) ≠ 0 for every non-zero polynomial &quot;P&quot; with integer coefficients, this problem can be approached by trying to find lower bounds of the form
:formula_15

where the right hand side is some positive function depending on some measure &quot;A&quot; of the size of the coefficients of &quot;P&quot;, and its degree &quot;d&quot;, and such that these lower bounds apply to all &quot;P&quot; ≠ 0. Such a bound is called a transcendence measure.

The case of &quot;d&quot; = 1 is that of &quot;classical&quot; diophantine approximation asking for lower bounds for
:formula_16.

The methods of transcendence theory and diophantine approximation have much in common: they both use the auxiliary function concept.

==Major results==

The Gelfond–Schneider theorem was the major advance in transcendence theory in the period 1900–1950. In the 1960s the method of Alan Baker on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers reanimated transcendence theory, with applications to numerous classical problems and diophantine equations.

==Mahler&#x27;s classification==
Kurt Mahler in 1932 partitioned the transcendental numbers into 3 classes, called S, T, and U. Definition of these classes draws on an extension of the idea of a Liouville number (cited above).

===Measure of irrationality of a real number===

One way to define a Liouville number is to consider how small a given real number x makes linear polynomials |&quot;qx&quot; − &quot;p&quot;| without making them exactly 0. Here &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; are integers with |&quot;p&quot;|, |&quot;q&quot;| bounded by a positive integer &quot;H&quot;.

Let formula_17 be the minimum non-zero absolute value these polynomials take and take:

:formula_18
:formula_19

ω(&quot;x&quot;, 1) is often called the measure of irrationality of a real number &quot;x&quot;. For rational numbers, ω(&quot;x&quot;, 1) = 0 and is at least 1 for irrational real numbers. A Liouville number is defined to have infinite measure of irrationality. Roth&#x27;s theorem says that irrational real algebraic numbers have measure of irrationality 1.

===Measure of transcendence of a complex number===
Next consider the values of polynomials at a complex number &quot;x&quot;, when these polynomials have integer coefficients, degree at most &quot;n&quot;, and height at most &quot;H&quot;, with &quot;n&quot;, &quot;H&quot; being positive integers.

Let formula_20 be the minimum non-zero absolute value such polynomials take at formula_21 and take:
:formula_22
:formula_23

Suppose this is infinite for some minimum positive integer &quot;n&quot;. A complex number &quot;x&quot; in this case is called a U number of degree &quot;n&quot;.

Now we can define 
:formula_24 
ω(&quot;x&quot;) is often called the measure of transcendence of &quot;x&quot;. If the ω(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) are bounded, then ω(&quot;x&quot;) is finite, and &quot;x&quot; is called an S number. If the ω(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) are finite but unbounded, &quot;x&quot; is called a T number. &quot;x&quot; is algebraic if and only if ω(&quot;x&quot;) = 0.

Clearly the Liouville numbers are a subset of the U numbers. William LeVeque in 1953 constructed U numbers of any desired degree. The Liouville numbers and hence the U numbers are uncountable sets. They are sets of measure 0.

T numbers also comprise a set of measure 0. It took about 35 years to show their existence. Wolfgang M. Schmidt in 1968 showed that examples exist. However, almost all complex numbers are S numbers. Mahler proved that the exponential function sends all non-zero algebraic numbers to S numbers: this shows that &quot;e&quot; is an S number and gives a proof of the transcendence of . This number is known not to be a U number. Many other transcendental numbers remain unclassified.

Two numbers &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; are called algebraically dependent if there is a non-zero polynomial &quot;P&quot; in two indeterminates with integer coefficients such that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0. There is a powerful theorem that two complex numbers that are algebraically dependent belong to the same Mahler class. This allows construction of new transcendental numbers, such as the sum of a Liouville number with &quot;e&quot; or .

The symbol S probably stood for the name of Mahler&#x27;s teacher Carl Ludwig Siegel, and T and U are just the next two letters.

===Koksma&#x27;s equivalent classification===
Jurjen Koksma in 1939 proposed another classification based on approximation by algebraic numbers.

Consider the approximation of a complex number &quot;x&quot; by algebraic numbers of degree ≤ &quot;n&quot; and height ≤ &quot;H&quot;. Let α be an algebraic number of this finite set such that |&quot;x&quot; − α| has the minimum positive value. Define ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) and ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) by:

:formula_25
:formula_26

If for a smallest positive integer &quot;n&quot;, ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is infinite, &quot;x&quot; is called a U*-number of degree &quot;n&quot;.

If the ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) are bounded and do not converge to 0, &quot;x&quot; is called an S*-number,

A number &quot;x&quot; is called an A*-number if the ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) converge to 0.

If the ω*(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) are all finite but unbounded, &quot;x&quot; is called a T*-number,

Koksma&#x27;s and Mahler&#x27;s classifications are equivalent in that they divide the transcendental numbers into the same classes. The &quot;A*&quot;-numbers are the algebraic numbers.

===LeVeque&#x27;s construction===

Let

:formula_27

It can be shown that the &quot;n&quot;th root of λ (a Liouville number) is a U-number of degree &quot;n&quot;.

This construction can be improved to create an uncountable family of U-numbers of degree &quot;n&quot;. Let &quot;Z&quot; be the set consisting of every other power of 10 in the series above for λ. The set of all subsets of &quot;Z&quot; is uncountable. Deleting any of the subsets of &quot;Z&quot; from the series for λ creates uncountably many distinct Liouville numbers, whose &quot;n&quot;th roots are U-numbers of degree &quot;n&quot;.

===Type===
The supremum of the sequence {ω(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)} is called the type. Almost all real numbers are S numbers of type 1, which is minimal for real S numbers. Almost all complex numbers are S numbers of type 1/2, which is also minimal. The claims of almost all numbers were conjectured by Mahler and in 1965 proved by Vladimir Sprindzhuk.

==Open problems==

While the Gelfond–Schneider theorem proved that a large class of numbers was transcendental, this class was still countable. Many well-known mathematical constants are still not known to be transcendental, and in some cases it is not even known whether they are rational or irrational. A partial list can be found here.

A major problem in transcendence theory is showing that a particular set of numbers is algebraically independent rather than just showing that individual elements are transcendental. So while we know that &quot;e&quot; and &quot;π&quot; are transcendental that doesn&#x27;t imply that &quot;e&quot; + &quot;π&quot; is transcendental, nor other combinations of the two (except &quot;e&quot;π, Gelfond&#x27;s constant, which is known to be transcendental). Another major problem is dealing with numbers that are not related to the exponential function. The main results in transcendence theory tend to revolve around &quot;e&quot; and the logarithm function, which means that wholly new methods tend to be required to deal with numbers that cannot be expressed in terms of these two objects in an elementary fashion.

Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture would solve the first of these problems somewhat as it deals with algebraic independence and would indeed confirm that &quot;e&quot; + &quot;π&quot; is transcendental. It still revolves around the exponential function, however, and so would not necessarily deal with numbers such as Apéry&#x27;s constant or the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Another extremely difficult unsolved problem is the so-called constant or identity problem.

<text>Delvin Christopher &quot;D.J.&quot; Countess (born January 9, 1982, in Sacramento, California) is an American former professional soccer goalkeeper.

He graduated from Bella Vista High School in Fair Oaks, California.

==Club career==
Countess attended University of California, Los Angeles, where he had a 1.02 goals against average, good for a second in the Pacific-10 Conference his freshman season.

Upon completing his freshman year, he joined the Major League Soccer (MLS) Project-40 program. On August 3, 2001, he acquired by the MetroStars through a weighted lottery. During his first year he served as a backup to Tim Howard. Countess was traded to the Dallas Burn on March 13, 2002, prior to the start of the 2002 season. However, shortly after an impressive debut match, he suffered a shoulder injury and was forced to miss the remainder of the season. He bounced back in 2003, starting in twenty-four league matches and was named the clubs Defender of the Year after tallying 115 saves. He also tied an MLS record that season by facing a total of ten penalty kicks; and he set the league record by saving four, including two in a single game which was also another league record. In 2004, he was traded to Chicago Fire, where he spent the 2004 season as the primary backup to Henry Ring. Countess made only two first team appearances. Real Salt Lake, then coached by Countess&#x27; youth coach, John Ellinger, took Countess as a second draft pick in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. Countess started in twenty-seven matches for the expansion team but his option was not picked up following the season.

Though several MLS clubs expressed interest in acquiring him in early 2006, Countess opted not to return to MLS and to instead pursue a career in Europe. In mid-2006 he had trials with French clubs AJ Auxerre and FC Metz, and Swedish club Östers IF. All three teams expressed interest but it was Östers IF who then played in Sweden&#x27;s top division the Allsvenskan that signed Countess to a contract until the end of the 2006 season. Up to October 2006, he had started in three matches for the club. In early 2007, he signed for Provincial Osorno, in the Chilean second division, Liga Chilena de Fútbol: Primera B. After helping them win promotion to the Primera División, in July 2007 he moved to Argentina to play for newly promoted Atlético Tigre in the Argentine Primera División. Countess sustained a wrist injury early in the 2008 season with Tigre, he underwent surgery in April 2008.

==International career==
Countess has played at various levels for the United States national team playing a total of seventy-two games for the U-17&#x27;s, U-20&#x27;s and U-23&#x27;s. He was in goal for the U.S. when they finished fourth at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand, and in the 2001 U-20 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina. In 2004, he played in the US U-23 Olympic team that failed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Dream Keeper Foundation==
Countess has been involved in humanitarian work throughout his career. While playing for Real Salt Lake he established the Dream Keeper Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing funding for Utah children in need of medical care.

<doc id="1157714" wikidata="Q2673931" url="?curid=1157714" title="Pasar malam">
<text>Pasar malam is a Malay word that literally means &quot;night market&quot; (the word &quot;pasar&quot; comes from &quot;bazaar&quot; in Persian). A &quot;pasar malam&quot; is a street market in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore that opens in the evening, usually in residential neighbourhoods. Pasar malams are culturally very similar to night markets in Asian countries such as China (Nanluoguxiang, Shuang&#x27;an Night Markets), Thailand (Chatuchak Market), Taiwan (Shilin Market), Vietnam (Hanoi&#x27;s Old Quarter), South Korea (Namdaemum Market) and India (Mangal Bazaar).

The pasar malam may be held in a fixed location or itinerant, offering a variety of products such as street food, snacks, desserts, produce, apparel, accessories, handmade crafts, houseware, gadgets, toys, knick-knacks, and ornaments at cheap or reasonable prices. Counterfeit goods such as fake branded wearables and pirated CDs may also be sold at a pasar malam.

Pasar malam might resemble a night festival or a fairground, where fair games and kiddy rides, like a mini carousel or mini train ride, may also be present. Several quintessential fair snacks like cotton candy, ice cream, hot dogs, and grilled sausages are also popular, next to the offerings of traditional local delicacies. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. Haggling over prices is a common practice at such markets.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pasar Malam&quot; translates to &quot;Night Market&quot; in English. The term is derived from the Malay language, where &quot;pasar&quot; means &quot;market&quot; and &quot;malam&quot; means &quot;night.&quot;

==History==

In the Indonesian archipelago, markets are traditionally held on different days with locations rotating among participating villages. This traditional economic custom is known as &quot;Hari Pasaran&quot; (lit. &quot;market days&quot;) in Javanese. After being further developed, the market was established more permanently like it is today. The night market is regarded as the continuation of this non-permanent market culture. Night markets are usually held during special occasions or festivals, such as Sekaten festival in Java, or held on Ramadhan nights, approximately a week before Lebaran.

Among traditional night markets, one of the earliest and biggest was the annual Lunar New Year night market in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Held three days before the Lunar New Year, this night market began in the late 1820s as an initiative of Tan Eng Goan, the 1st &quot;Majoor der Chineezen&quot; of Batavia, and became a prototype for similar night markets.

After the discovery of electricity and lightbulbs, night markets were held more frequently in colonial Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century. The most notable one is Pasar Gambir, a night market fair held in 1906 and yearly from 1921 until the outbreak of World War II in 1942, in the Koningsplein, Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Merdeka Square, Jakarta, Indonesia) to celebrate the birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. It has become the predecessor of the annual Jakarta Fair and Den Haag&#x27;s Tong Tong Fair which are a night market and festival held for several weeks.

==Indonesia==

In Java, especially in the Javanese royal cities Yogyakarta and Surakarta, the grand week-long pasar malam is usually held annually during the Sekaten festival to celebrate Mawlid, or the birthday of Muhammad. During colonial Dutch East Indies, the annual Pasar Malam was held in Pasar Gambir (today Merdeka Square) and became the predecessor of modern Jakarta&#x27;s annual Jakarta Fair.
Today, several &quot;kecamatan&quot; (districts) in Jakarta and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly pasar malam, usually every Saturday night in a nearby &quot;alun-alun&quot; square, open fields, or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling a variety of goods and foods, some pasar malam also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini carousels or mini train rides. In Palembang, a popular pasar malam is located on the front of Kuto Besak Fort on the bank of the Musi River. This pasar malam sells local dishes and snacks such as pempek, lenggang, and tekwan, and also offers souvenirs and handy crafts.

==Brunei==

Pasar Malam can be found in various locations throughout Brunei. Some of the most notable ones include:
*Gadong Night Market: Located in the heart of Gadong, this night market is one of the largest and most popular in Brunei. It features numerous stalls selling a wide range of food, including local delicacies, fresh produce and snacks. The Gadong Night Market is particularly famous for its vibrant atmosphere and diverse culinary offerings.
*Food Street Yayasan: located within the Yayasan Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Complex in Bandar Seri Begawan, is a lively night market that offers a diverse array of culinary delights, from traditional Bruneian dishes to international cuisine. Operating primarily in the evenings, this vibrant food street serves as a bustling hub for locals and tourists to enjoy a variety of food, such as Nasi Katok, Ambuyat, Satay, Kuih and Laksa. This lively food street generally operates for several months each year in recurring cycles, with new vendors featured in each cycle.

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, Pasar Malam is normally set as a temporarily closed street for vehicles and open for pedestrians from evening until late night weekly. At certain locations due to frequency or a few times a week, narrow and busy streets also safety reasons, Pasar Malam will open at Tapak Pasar Malam at nighttime which describes an allocation space that converts a parking space during the daytime.

Due to the hot Malaysian weather during the daytime, the Pasar Malam has become a nightlife activity that attracts the local community after working time and the tourist crowd to shop with moderate night temperatures looking for cheap hot foods, clothing, groceries, etc. The vendor licences are obtained from local authorities under the local council area.

The majority of the local vendors sell plenty types of drinks, hot foods, and local delicacies from Malay, Malaysian Chinese, and Indian backgrounds which are famous and also difficult to find, fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fish and seafood, fresh meat and poultry, toys, family range of clothes and accessories. Some local vendors also sell live pets or even phone accessories.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, the pasar malams of old were phased out in 1978 due to regulation but were fractionally revived in housing estates in 1991 as a cultural selling point. Notable pasar malams of old included the Woodlands Pasar Malam which attracted crowds from Johor Bahru and the People&#x27;s Park Pasar Malam in Chinatown. Present-day pasar malams are organised at specific locations on a temporary lease, usually before festive occasions such as Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, and Deepavali. The organisers are required to submit a tender bid to the People&#x27;s Association for the right to host the Pasar Malam. Food hawkers are licensed by the NEA and required to pass a food hygiene course. Pasar malams are reported to face sustainability challenges due to rising rental costs.

==The Netherlands==

In the Netherlands, a yearly Indo-Eurasian festival was held in The Hague under the name &quot;Tong Tong Fair&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Pasar Malam Besar&quot; (&quot;besar&quot; meaning &quot;big&quot;). After 63 editions, the festival closed down in 2024 due to financial difficulties Due to the high number of Indo-Eurasians and the successive success of this event since 1959, dozens of pasar malam are held each year in the Netherlands. Recently the Indonesian embassy has started sponsoring a yearly &quot;Pasar Malam Indonesia&quot;, mainly to promote Indonesian business and enhance Dutch-Indonesian relations.

<doc id="1157731" wikidata="Q1999391" url="?curid=1157731" title="Suzuki X-90">
<text>The Suzuki X-90 is a front engine, rear or four wheel drive, two door, two seater car manufactured and marketed by Suzuki for the model years 1995-1997. Derived from the Suzuki Vitara, the X-90 featured a T Section removable roof. Replacing the Samurai in the market in the United States, Suzuki began marketing the X-90 in Japan by the end of 1995, and in western markets in April 1996.

== Overview ==
Suzuki presented the production vehicle in 1995, and began marketing the X-90 by the end of that year in Japan, with international markets the following year. 1,348 were sold in Japan, and 7,205 X-90s were imported into the United States. More than half in the United States were sold in 1996, with sales of 2,087 the next year, and 477 in 1998.

During 1996, 484 vehicles were imported into Australia. The X-90 was also imported into Europe. By the middle of 1997, the retail pricing had dropped by 25%. No further imports occurred, and the last of the vehicles sold in 1999. The X-90 was the base vehicle for Red Bull&#x27;s advertising vehicles, which featured a 1.5 m (5&#x27;) mockup of the company&#x27;s product can mounted over the trunk.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the X-90 on its list of &quot;The 13 Worst Cars of the Last 20 Years.&quot; In March 2022, Motor Trend named the X-90 #1 on its list of the 25 worst cars of the 1990s.

Philippe Cousteau Special Edition

Towards the end of the X-90&#x27;s production run some X-90s in Europe were sold as the Suzuki Vitara X-90 Philippe Cousteau Special Edition. These featured a moulded bodykit that included a bullbar, running boards, wheel arch extensions all finished in the body colour as well as special 16 inch wheels and decals that numbered the vehicle out of 3000. The special edition was named after the French cinematographer Philippe Cousteau, despite his death occurring more than 15 years before the first X-90 was produced.

== Specifications ==
The X-90 used a 1.6 L I4 16 valve engine which produced and was available with four wheel drive or rear wheel drive, and either a five speed manual or automatic transmission. The X-90 featured dual air bags, anti lock brakes, optional air conditioning, and one dealer installed six disc CD changer.

The suspension used MacPherson struts and coil springs in front and coil springs with wishbone and trailing links in the rear. A space saver spare wheel is stored in the trunk, and space behind the two seats offers further cargo area. The X-90 debuted as a concept car at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show.

<doc id="1157737" wikidata="Q7235300" url="?curid=1157737" title="Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway">
<text>The Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway, (known informally as the &#x27;Potts&#x27;), was a railway built between Shrewsbury, England, and quarry locations at Nantmawr and Criggion in Wales. It was initially opened in 1866; despite the extensive title it never reached further than those extremities. It had cost about £1.5 million to construct, but its financial performance was extremely poor, and economies resulted in near-suspension of maintenance, leading to dangerous conditions. The line rapidly became very run down as a result of low revenues and poor maintenance, and was closed at the instigation of the Board of Trade for safety reasons in June 1880. It lay derelict for 30 years but was revived when the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway re-opened it as a light railway in 1911.

==Background==
By the early 1860s Shrewsbury had become an important railway centre, dominated together by the Great Western Railway and the London and North Western Railway, and the main station was approached by trunk lines controlled by those companies, separately and jointly.

Shrewsbury itself was an important county town, but its hinterland was rural, agricultural and sparsely populated. Nevertheless, it had a strategic importance, in being the gateway to a large tract of land in mid-Wales. Earlier aspirations to form a direct railway route from London through Shrewsbury to a North Wales harbour, enabling a direct packet boat route to Dublin, had been superseded by the Chester and Holyhead Railway, and the development of Holyhead as a ferry port.

==West Shropshire Railway==
Richard Samuel France was the owner of extensive limestone quarries; limestone is a heavy mineral and conveying it to market was expensive and difficult. France proposed a railway linking his quarries at Llanymynech through Kinnerley to Westbury (Salop), a place on the Shrewsbury and Welshpool Railway about 11 miles west of Shrewsbury. France succeeded in getting the &quot;West Shropshire Mineral Railway&quot; authorised, by an act of Parliament, West Shropshire Mineral Railway Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. clxxxv), of 29 July 1862.

France&#x27;s objective was to get the limestone to a main line railway station for onward consignment, and he was the prime mover in promoting the railway. The old idea of reaching a Welsh ferryport for Dublin remained, and a route involving a two-mile tunnel had been thought about. There was evidently some difficulty about the choice of Westbury, for the following year he obtained a modifying act of Parliament, the West Shropshire Mineral Railway Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxlv), on 13 July 1863; now his line would run from Llanymynech to Red Hill, much nearer Shrewsbury.

No doubt reflecting on the impossibility of raising subscription capital for a railway with only one potential customer, France now extended the vision, and the scope of his proposed railway network, to include limekilns at Nantmawr and granite quarries at Criggion, and a branch to Great Ness. Moreover, the line would now carry passengers, and the company would be reincorporated as the &quot;Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway&quot; (S&amp;NWR). An application was made for running powers into the main Shrewsbury station, but the running powers were opposed during the parliamentary process, so that the S&amp;NWR would have to build its own line alongside the Welshpool line, and construct its own station at Shrewsbury. This third act of Parliament, the West Shropshire Mineral Railway (New Lines) Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cxxviii), was passed on 30 June 1864.

==Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway==
The North Staffordshire Railway observed these developments and encouraged the projection of a subsidiary, the &quot;Shrewsbury and Potteries Junction Railway&quot;; this line got its authorising act, the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxli), on 5 July. The Potteries district around Stoke-on-Trent was the NSR&#x27;s home, and a long line westward through Shrewsbury into north west Wales appeared attractive. The Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway would, it seemed, make an ideal partner in this venture that might stretch from Market Drayton.
The alliance was agreed and progressed through Parliament, gaining authorisation in the (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cci) on 16 July, and the result was the &quot;Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway&quot;, commonly abbreviated to &quot;the Potts&quot;. The new company now contemplated extending to Porthmadog.

The first part of the line, from Shrewsbury to Llanymynech, was opened without ceremony on 13 August 1866; there were four trains each way except Sunday, when there were two. The line was double track. The line had its own terminus in the grounds of the Shrewsbury Abbey; trains leaving faced a stiff climb at 1 in 47 to get out of the station, to gain sufficient height to pass over the existing main lines, but after that the line was generally level or nearly so. There was a connecting spur from the joint line from Wellington. The main line of the railway ran parallel to and alongside the Welshpool line on its south side as far as Redhill, where it crossed over the other route and struck northwest.

The Abbey Foregate spur was opened at the same time, joining the Shrewsbury and Wellington Joint Railway to Wellington east of Shrewsbury, the only connection at Shrewsbury with other lines. At Llanymynech the line terminated in a junction with the Cambrian Railways; the PS&amp;NWR had its own platforms there. The main line was double track at first, singled later, and there were fourteen stations. The total length of the network was now 28 miles.

The company&#x27;s finances were in a desperate state from the outset, and a debenture holder, dissatisfied with the treatment of his claim for payment, obtained a writ against the company. On 3 December 1866 bailiffs arrived at Shrewsbury station to take possession of the station and the line, and of arriving trains.

Subsequently, train operation took place only by consent of bailiffs who travelled with the trains. This state of affairs could hardly continue, and the company decided to sell some assets to realise ready cash. Auctioneers were appointed, but the sale of locomotives and other assets produced poor returns and the railway ceased operation from 21 December 1866.

Public services were resumed in December 1868 at a much reduced level. The double track section of the line was singled, probably during this closure period, and cash generated from the sale of rails was used to buy wagons that were urgently necessary for traffic purposes. Despite stringent cost saving measures, the line made only the smallest of profits, on capital expenditure of £1.5 million.

When the line reopened in 1868, there were five trains each way daily except Sundays when there were two. Co-operative arrangements with the Cambrian Railways had been established so that connections at Llanymynech were good, and through fares for certain journeys were available.

In 1871 the Criggion branch was opened, diverging at Kinnerley station. This was followed in 1872 by the Nantmawr extension from the Llanymynech former terminus; PS&amp;NWR trains had running powers for a few yards there over the Cambrian Railways before diverging northwards towards Nantmawr.

==Closure==
By the mid-1870s the company was losing money heavily; from 1874 a loss of over £2,000 annually was recorded for three successive years. As Perkins delicately puts it, &quot;the stern pressure of liabilities caused a corresponding scarcity of funds for working&quot;, and maintenance of track and structures was hardly carried out.

In 1880 a 25 mph speed restriction was imposed on the whole line because of the poor standard of permanent way maintenance. This was insisted on by Col Rich of the Board of Trade. The deterioration continued, and this culminated in an enforced closure of the line on 22 June 1880. This was the end of the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway and the core of its infrastructure network.

==After the suspension==
R. S. France was still the proprietor of quarries at Nantmawr, and he still needed to get his product to market. The Nantmawr branch of the Potts line crossed the Cambrian Railways line at Llanymynech. If a connection was made, the Nantmawr line could become a branch of the Cambrian Railways and operate as a mineral line. France negotiated with the Cambrian Railways and with the receiver of the Potts line, and a deal was done. From 1 June 1881 the Cambrian would carry the traffic, and pay the PSNWR 3d a ton for the use of the branch. It evidently took some time to implement the agreement, for the traffic started on 1 January 1886.

In time the Cambrian saw that this was potentially a permanent arrangement, and altered its lines at Llanymynech so that the continuation of its line to Llanfyllin branched from the Nantmawr branch; previously the two branches had crossed one another, and this arrangement simplified operations. The new system was opened on The Nantmawr branch reopened on 1 January 1896 and the Cambrian deviation was commissioned on 27 January 1896.

The Tanat Valley Light Railway was later opened, on 5 January 1904; on an east – west trajectory it crossed the Nantmawr branch at Blodwell Junction, actually using a short section of the branch. In fact from this time the Nantmawr terminus was reached from Blodwell Junction, and the section of the earlier Shropshire Railway to Blodwell from the junction on the Cambrian Railways west of Llanymynech was closed down.

Meanwhile, a new railway scheme was created, reviving earlier aspirations to connect the Potteries district. The Potts shareholders agreed on 14 March 1888 to accept £350,000 as the value of their shares, to be transferred to shares in a new Shropshire Railways Company, which was to build a connecting line to Hodnet on the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Wellington to Market Drayton line. The line was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Shropshire Railways Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. cxcii) of 7 August 1888 but never built. On 24 August the Potts company&#x27;s rolling stock and other moveable assets were sold by public auction.

==Revival==

The major part of the Potteries Railway network was thus inactive and unmaintained. It appeared that there might never be any retrieval of its capability of a railway. However, in 1907 Holman Fred Stephens, later Colonel Stephens, who already had several light railways in his control, took an interest in the dormant line. He decided that the Potts Line could be revived as a Light Railway. He obtained the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway Order 1909 on 17 January 1908, authorising the operation of all the Shropshire Railways system except the Nantmawr branch as a Light Railway. The new company was called the &quot;Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway&quot;.

The formal re-opening of the line took place on 13 April 1911, this time with invited guests. Opening to the general public took place the following day.

The financial performance of the new company was extremely poor, and maintenance and operations were reduced to the minimum.

The decline resulting in closure of all passenger operation, except for occasional excursions, was discontinued on 6 November 1933. The Criggion quarry train ran weekly, and occasional ordinary goods traffic served the intermediate stations.

==Military use==
In 1941 the entire line except the Criggion branch was requisitioned by the War Department and established to serve an ammunition store. Extensive track renewal took place. Army steam engines were brought in, to service numerous storage depots that were set up. A new exchange location with the main line was established at Hookagate. From 1 June 1941 the War Department operated all trains on the line, military and civilian.

In 1947 the line was returned to civilian status, and the company was nationalised (along with most other main line railways in Great Britain) in 1948. The War Department usage continued, until in 1959 that came to an end, and in December 1959 the Criggion stone traffic ceased to operate as well. The final scheduled train ran on 26 February 1960 and on 29 February the line was closed. Abbey goods yard at Shrewsbury was retained.

The Nantmawr branch too continued as part of British Railways. The former Tanat Valley line had closed to passengers on 15 January 1951, and from December 1960 goods operation west of Blodwell Junction ceased. Nantmawr continued to be served by mineral trains from Oswestry.

==Locations down to 1880==
During the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway period, passenger train operation ceased during the suspension 1866 – 1868, and from 1880.

Little is known about the locomotives. According to Woodcock one of them, named &quot;Black Tom&quot;, was a 0-4-2 tender locomotive built by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy in 1848 and acquired from the London and North Western Railway in 1866.

<text>Sanguine () is a stain, or non-standard tincture in heraldry, of a blood-red colour. 

In the past it was sometimes taken to be equivalent to murrey, but they are now considered two distinct tinctures. It is a darker red, the colour of arterial blood. A shade of red used to depict the tincture Sanguine in armorials should be darker than the shade used for regular Gules, as the shade of purple used for murrey should be darker than the one used for Purpure. It also should be sufficiently red to avoid appearing brown, in order not to introduce confusion with tenné.

Roundels of sanguine are referred to as &quot;guzes&quot;.

In the system of poetic associations, sanguine is sometimes associated with the gemstone jacinth and with the Dragon&#x27;s head.

<doc id="1157757" wikidata="Q497601" url="?curid=1157757" title="Geunchogo of Baekje">
<text>King Geunchogo, Chogo II (324–375, r. 346–375) was the 13th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He is claimed as the King reigned over the apex of Baekje&#x27;s powers.

==Background==
Geunchogo was the fourth son of the 11th king Biryu and became king upon the death of the 12th king Gye. His reign seems to have marked the permanent ascendancy of the descendants of the 5th king Chogo (reflected in Geunchogo&#x27;s name) over those of the 8th king Goi, and ended the alternating kingship of the two lines.

==Strengthening royal power==
Upon ascending the throne, he set out to solidify the royal power within the Baekje state. He reduced the power of the aristocracy and set up a system of local government with regional heads appointed by the court. He married a wife from the Jin clan, setting a precedent for his successors, and he moved the capital to Hansan, today&#x27;s southeast Seoul.

==Territorial expansion==
Under Geunchogo, the kingdom reached its greatest geographic extent and political power. The remaining tribes of Mahan were annexed in 369, completing Baekje&#x27;s control over all of present-day Jeolla Province. Gaya confederacy states west of the Nakdong River were also made Baekje dependencies.

In 369, Baekje was invaded by Goguryeo, but counterattacked in force at the Battle of Chiyang. In 371, the Baekje army of 30,000, led by Crown Prince Geungusu, took the fortress of Pyongyang and killed Gogugwon of Goguryeo.

At the end of these conquests, Baekje ringed the Yellow Sea, and controlled much of the Korean peninsula, including all of Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheong, and Jeolla Province and parts of Gangwon and Hwanghae Provinces.

==Foreign relations==
In 366, Geunchogo allied with Silla, which bordered Baekje on the east, maintaining a rough balance of power among the Three Kingdoms.

At its greatest extent, Baekje control reached north into what is now China. The kingdom also established diplomatic relations with the early Jin China in 345 and Japan in 367. According to both Korean and Chinese sources, the first diplomatic contact between Baekje and China took place in 372, when Geunchogo sent a mission to the court of Jin. In the same year, the Jin court sent a mission granting him the title of the &quot;General Stabilizing the East and the Administrator-General of Lelang&quot; ().

During his reign, Baekje activated and led the commercial trading among China, Korean Peninsula and Japan; known as the triangle trade. Traditionally the commerce was mostly dominated by Chinese emperors; however, after China lost control of Lelang, northern China came under the rule of the &quot;Five Barbarians&quot;, all of whom were inexperienced at sea. Baekje established commanderies in the Liaoxi regions of China and advanced into Kyūshū of Japan, and rose as the new trading center of East Asia.

Baekje also exported culture to Baekje&#x27;s allies in the Wa kingdom of Yamato period Japan. The evidence of friendly relationship of Baekje with Japan is the Seven-Branched Sword which Geunchogo gave to the Yamato ruler. According to &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Geunchogo also sent scholars Wang In and Ajiki to Japan to spread knowledge of Baekje culture: Confucianism and Chinese characters. Then Wani taught Confucian classics to emperor&#x27;s heir Ujinowakiiratuko.

==&quot;Seogi&quot;==
During his reign a history of Baekje titled &quot;Seogi&quot; () was compiled by the scholar Go Heung (). Its purpose was not only to record history, but also to justify his rule and to display the power of Baekje. No known copy of &quot;Seogi&quot; has survived to the modern era.

==&quot;Samguk sagi&quot;==
&quot;&quot;King Geunchogo was the fourth son of king Biryu. His body and countenance were unusually robust, and he possessed far-reaching knowledge. When King Gye died, he succeeded him&quot;.&quot;
* 347 AD, spring, first month. Sacrifices were made for gods of heaven and earth. Bae Jin Jeong was made Minister of the Court: he was the queen&#x27;s relative.

* 368 AD, spring, third month, first day of the month. There was a solar eclipse. Messengers were dispatched to Silla, sent with two good horses.
* 369 AD, autumn, ninth month. King Sayu of Goguryeo, at the head of 20,000 men on foot and horse, came to the village of Chiyang, and divided his forces to attack and sack the houses of the people. The king dispatched the crown prince with soldiers directly to Chiyang, and they quickly attacked and defeated them. They captured more than 5,000, and these prisoners were presented as gifts to the general and his warriors. Winter, 11th month. A great examination was made [of the troops] in the area south of the Han river. The flags used were all yellow.
* 371 AD, Goguryeo raised soldiers and came. The king heard this, and his men hid in the ditches and canals. Then they suddenly rushed out and attacked them. The soldiers of Goguryeo were defeated. Winter. The king and the crown prince led 30,000 spirited troops to attack Goguryeo at the fortress of Pyongyang. The King of Goguryeo, Sayu, fought powerfully to repel them, but was hit by a stray arrow and died. Our king led his men to retreat, and we moved our capital to Mt. Hansan.
* 372 AD, spring, first month. Messengers were dispatched to the Jin court with tribute. Autumn, seventh month. There was an earthquake.
* 373 AD, spring, second month. Messengers were dispatched to the Jin court with tribute. Autumn, seventh month. A fortress was built at Mt. Cheongmok. The master of Doksan Fortress led 300 men and fled to Silla.
* 375 AD, autumn, seventh month. Goguryeo came and attacked the northern lowlands at the fortress of Sugok, and took it. The king dispatched men to repel the invasion, but they were not successful. The king also had a general raise a large army to revenge themselves, but that year there was a drought and so the plan did not succeed. Winter, 11th month. The king died. The Goki [Record of Ancient Matters] says, when Baekje was founded, they did not keep written records. However, in this period they go the services of the scholar Go Heung, and he first began writing history. However, Go Heung is not made clear in any other records, and so it is not known who he was.

<text>The Daihatsu Charade is a supermini car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Daihatsu from 1977 to 2000. It is considered by Daihatsu as a &quot;large compact&quot; or &quot;supermini&quot; car, to differentiate it from the smaller &quot;kei car&quot; compacts in its line-up, such as the Daihatsu Mira. In Japan, it offers buyers more interior space and a larger engine that allows for the car to also be used outside of urban areas. It replaced the Daihatsu Consorte, although the Charmant took over from the bigger-engined Consortes, and didn&#x27;t share a platform with a Toyota product.

The name &quot;Charade&quot; is a direct reference to the French racetrack Circuit de Charade, which held the French Grand Prix in 1965, 1969, 1970 and 1972.

In China, the Daihatsu Charade was called Xiali and was produced by Tianjin FAW, under the registered mark of &quot;China FAW&quot;. From September 1986 to 2009, it sold over 1.5 million units in that country. It also provided the basis for countless unlicensed Chinese copies, often depending on fibreglass moldings taken from the second generation Charade. Production ended in 2012.


== First generation (G10, G20; 1977–1983) ==
The first generation (G10) appeared in October 1977. It was a front-engined front-wheel drive car, originally available only as a five-door hatchback, powered by a 993 cc three-cylinder, all-aluminum engine (CB20) with . Japanese market cars claimed JIS at 5,500 rpm. The three-door hatchback version (&quot;Runabout&quot;), introduced in the fall of 1978, received two small circular opera windows in the C-pillars. The Charade was a surprise best-seller in Japan, where ever tighter emissions standards had made many observers consider the one-litre car dead in the marketplace. The Charade became an overnight success and also became the Japanese &quot;Car of the Year&quot; for 1979.



The early G10 (Series 1) had round headlights and the later G10 (Series 2) had square headlights. The Series 2 was introduced in October 1980. Between the introduction in November 1977 and the end of production in December 1982, Daihatsu built 89,792 G10/G20 type Charades.

The Daihatsu Charade was very popular in Chile and some other Latin American countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Originally the same as in the rest of the world, later Chilean Charades (called G20s) came equipped with a downsleeved 843 cc version (CD) of Daihatsu&#x27;s three-cylinder engine. This engine produced at 5,500 rpm and has also appeared in export versions of the Daihatsu Hijet. The G20 appeared in 1980 and was developed as a result of a Chilean decision to lower import tariffs on cars with engines of less than 850 cc in May 1979.

The G20 was able to run on low-octane fuel or even ethanol. The first G20 version (1978–1981) had round headlights, while the second generation G20 (sold from 1981 to 1984) received the same facelift as did the G10, meaning square headlights and slightly different rear lights. The three-door &quot;Runabout&quot; retained the larger 1-liter &quot;CB20&quot; engine, and also received a five-speed manual transmission and a tachometer.

At 1981 Tokyo Motor Show, Daihatsu displayed a 1-liter turbo car concept in collaboration with Italian exotic sport car maker De Tomaso Automobili. This car was based on the 3-door Charade XTE and known as the Charade De Tomaso. This idea was later applied for mass production on the second generation.

=== Greece ===
The Greek Automeccanica company, founded in 1979, developed an off-road style torpedo design version of the Charade à la the Citroën Méhari. With a metal body, the &quot;Daihatsu Zebra&quot; used Daihatsu mechanicals, grille and headlights, and many other Daihatsu parts. Production began in 1981 and continued until 1985, by which point changing Greek tax laws meant that this &quot;fun car&quot; could no longer be registered as a commercial vehicle and the market evaporated. The very first cars used the Series 1 round headlights; these were changed to the square Series 2 units before the first year of production had ended. Automeccanica also assembled regular Charades.

=== Competition ===

In 1979, two G10 Charades competed in the &quot;2400-kilometre Tour of Malaysia Rally&quot; and finished first and second. The G10 continued its competitiveness by winning the 2/1 class at 1981 Monte Carlo Rally while finishing 28th overall (out of 263 participants). They also won their class at the 1982 Safari Rally, where they finished 17th out of 72 starting cars.
Uruguayan driver Guillermo Viera driving his Daihatsu Charade G10 with his brother Agustín Viera as copilot, had competed several times in the &quot;19 Capitals Historic Rally&quot; of Uruguay. In 2011 they finished 41st in the overall rank, in 2012 they finished 18th, in 2014 they finished 9th, and in 2016 they finished second overall with a tight final difference with the winners of only two hundredths of a second after nearly 50 hours of competition. They were ranked seventh overall and first in its class at the &quot;500 miles rally&quot; of Entre Ríos in 2011. They went on to win Category A in the Uruguayan Championship of Historical Tourism in 2013.

== Second generation (G11/21/26/30; 1983–1988) ==
The second generation (G11) was released in March 1983, again as a three- or a five-door hatchback. It featured several new variations of the three-cylinder 1.0-litre engines, including a turbocharged version and naturally aspirated diesel or turbodiesel engines. The new 1.0-litre diesel engine &quot;CL&quot; was tested on 1 September 1983. To demonstrate the reliability of the new diesel engine, a Charade thus equipped was taken for 10 non-stop laps around the Japanese archipelago; the run lasted 117 days.

The turbo diesel first appeared in the fall of 1984. The base Charades received the naturally aspirated, three cylinder, 993 cc &quot;CB-series&quot; engines with . takes around 15–17 seconds. Japanese market models had twin carburettors as standard, while most export versions received a single unit which made marginally less power. This generation has drag coefficient of .

In Chile (and some other Latin American countries) this generation was called the G21, and like the G20 before it, it was equipped with the smaller 843 cc three-cylinder &quot;CD&quot; engine. The G21 was sold between 1985 and 1990 approximately.

The Charade Turbo and Charade De Tomaso models had the upgraded 1.0-litre &quot;CB&quot; series engine, called the &quot;CB50&quot; and &quot;CB60&quot;. The &quot;CB50&quot; was fitted with a very small IHI turbocharger, which increased its power to (JIS) in Japanese market cars or &quot;CB60&quot; producing (DIN) in European export models. The tiny turbocharger meant that an intercooler was not necessary. The suspension was lightly upgraded, with thicker anti-roll bars and slightly stiffer suspension, and the car also received alloy wheels rather than the standard steel items.

The turbo version was available in both bodystyles. Singaporean-market Charades received the same (JIS) engines as used in Japan. The Indonesian-built 5-door Charades (CKD and still labelled with Japanese &quot;J&quot; code on the VIN instead of Indonesian &quot;MF-MK&quot; VIN code) also received the same engines as its neighbor, the turbo model appeared in July 1986 and also the first turbo car to go on sale in the country.

There were high roofed versions available in some markets, either with the three- or five-door bodywork. This was called the &quot;Dolphin Roof&quot; in Japan. The three-door model was also available in a Van model for commercial use, offered with the naturally aspirated diesel or petrol engines and fitted with the higher roof. Depending on market requirements, the Charade Van was also available with blanked rear windows. To escape quotas and some of the ADR strictures, the high-roof van version was sold in Australia as the Daihatsu Charade Duet in parallel with the passenger models.

The G11 was produced with two front end treatments: with square headlights (Series 1) and with rectangular &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; shaped headlights (Series 2). The facelift was first presented in the summer of 1985. In Europe, the G11 underbody and various engines and transmissions also formed the basis for the Innocenti Minitre after Innocenti&#x27;s contract with British Leyland expired. The G11 underpinnings continued to be used by the Italian automaker until 1992. Aside from four- and five-speed manuals a two-speed automatic option called the &quot;Daimatic&quot; was also available.

In Australia the range began with the high roofed two-seater, three-door CC model, while the rest of the range (CS, CX, CX-A, and turbo CX-T) had five-door bodywork.

Taiwanese assembly began in 1983 or 1984. In 1987 they also presented a locally developed longer notchback version of the five-door, similar to the Subaru Tutto and Nissan March Cubic, sold as the Daihatsu Skywing. Developing a model locally also gained the assembler a three percent tax subsidy. In New Zealand, the naturally aspirated petrol model was assembled locally at General Motors&#x27; plant in Trentham. The Turbo was also sold there, imported fully built-up.

In October 1985, at the 26th Tokyo Motor Show, Daihatsu introduced the 926R, a prototype of a mid engine Charade, developed together with De Tomaso and designed to take part in the World Rally Championship for cars under 1,300 cc. With a 1.4 equivalence factor for forced induction engines, this meant that the downsized engine was classified as being of 1296.4 cc. The 926R had a mid-mounted 926 cc twelve valve, twin-cam, turbocharged three-cylinder &quot;CE&quot; engine, moving the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and delivering .

The 926R weighed and had wider fenders to cover the 205/225 15&quot; wheels. However, following significant crashes in the 1985 championship, Group B was banned and the 926R project was called off. There was also a limited homologation series of 200 units Charade 926 Turbo launched in November, equipped with the SOHC 6-valve version of the 926 cc engine and producing (JIS).

For China, the G11 Charade was known as the Tianjin TJ730 as a CKD from 1986 to 1988. It was then replaced by the popular G100 Charade.

In South Africa, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s local subsidiary assembled Daihatsu Charades beginning in March 1983. The only model available was the naturally aspirated petrol 1.0, with five doors and the high roof. Power is , and either a four- or five-speed manual transmission was available. These Charades were also exported to Italy to circumvent Italian laws hindering the import of Japanese cars. South African assembly ended in late 1985, when Alfa Romeo closed down their South African subsidiary. The Charade represented nearly half of Alfa Romeo&#x27;s South African production in 1985.

=== Competition ===
The second generation Daihatsu Charade did see some rally usage. Charades (both Turbos and normally aspirated cars) were entered in the 1984 through 1988 Safari Rallys. They won the A5 class and runner-up in A6 class in 1984. In 1985 they won both A3 and B5 categories. The Charades were finished at 13th, 14th and 19th overall out of 71 contestants, impressive for the little car. In 1986 and 1987 the Charades won the A5 class. The Swiss Daihatsu importer campaigned a Charade Turbo in their national Group A rally championship in 1985, with Florence L&#x27;Huillier as a driver.

== Third generation (G100; 1987–1993) ==


The third generation of the Daihatsu Charade (G100) debuted in January 1987. With styling by Daihatsu chief stylist Hiroshi Aoki and colleague Hideyuki Ueda, the more rounded design was able to reach a drag coefficient of .

It originally shipped with a carbureted or fuel injected naturally aspirated (&quot;CB23/36/37/90&quot;) and turbocharged (&quot;CB51/61&quot;) SOHC 6-valve 1.0-litre three-cylinder engines, also available as a diesel and turbodiesel (&quot;CL series&quot;). In New Zealand, this generation was available with a 846 cc &quot;ED10&quot; three-cylinder engine. The little 1.0-litre diesel engine continued to be one of the most fuel efficient cars in the world at the time. At a steady , a Charade turbodiesel fitted with the five-speed manual transmission was capable of a claimed .

The turbocharged SOHC 6-valve 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine was discontinued in February 1988 (until mid 1989 for several export markets) and replaced with a 1.3-litre four-cylinder with single carburetor or fuel injection (&quot;HC-E/F&quot;). The four-cylinder was built with lightness in mind, featuring a hollow crankshaft and camshaft, and the weight of a four-cylinder car was no higher than a similarly equipped three-cylinder model.

Featuring fully independent suspension front and rear, either three-door or five-door hatchback body styles were originally offered. There was also a version with permanent four-wheel drive and the fuel injected 1.3-litre engine, called the TXF/CXF/Will (3/5-door, G112 chassis code). This version was also exported to a few countries, for example in Scandinavia and Switzerland.

A 1.0-litre twin-cam fuel injected intercooled turbo (&quot;CB70/80&quot;), named GTti and delivering was later added, only available as a three-door hatch. There were two different sport models available (both with G100S-FMVZ model codes), the GTti and the GT-XX. Both versions are mechanically identical, but the GT-XX features many added luxury items. These include full bodykit, lightweight 14-inch speedline alloys, air-conditioning, power steering, one-touch electric window down, and electric sunroof. Some of these options were also available to buy as optional extras on the GTti. Side-skirts were also fitted to many GTtis, but in some countries they were only sold as a dealer optional extra.

The GT-XX is much rarer than the GTti, mainly being sold in Japan, although some were exported and sold in other countries in small numbers. All GT-XXs have engine code &quot;CB70&quot;, whereas GTtis can have &quot;CB70&quot; or &quot;CB80&quot;, depending on the country and region sold. There are no known differences with the actual engine internals, all &quot;CB70&quot;s feature catalyst emissions control systems.

Even some &quot;CB80&quot;s for Europe featured the catalyst, although UK cars did not. There are more than likely slight differences between the &quot;CB70&quot; and &quot;CB80&quot; ECU mapping, with &quot;CB70&quot; cars quoted as producing compared to the &quot;CB80&quot;&#x27;s . This is probably down to the &quot;CB70&quot; having the ignition timing mapped more advanced to suit the higher octane fuel used in Japan.

A slight facelift in February 1989 gave the cars smoother style rear lights and reflector panel, a slightly longer tailgate top spoiler, increased 70 mm length for hatchback (except for GTti/GT-XX), longer front blinkers (except for GTti/GT-XX) and a revised interior trim with fabric also on the door trim panels. A four-door sedan later expanded the range in April 1989, sold as the Charade Social in Japan. This generation was discontinued in 1993 for most markets, but the sedan version continued to be available in Japan until May 1994.

===North America===
The third-generation car was sold in the United States for just five years, from 1988 through 1992. The car sold poorly, despite construction &quot;as tight as a frozen head bolt&quot; and attractive styling for the market segment, perhaps because of its high price, few dealerships, rough-running three-cylinder, and low performance (0- in 15 seconds). Toyota, which had recently procured a controlling interest in Daihatsu, retired the Daihatsu brand in the US market after an abbreviated 1992 model year, but continued to provide existing Daihatsu customers after-sales support through to at least 2002. Only the three-door hatchbacks and four-door sedans were available.

The North American Charade appeared in three different trim levels until 1989; the CES (base model), CLS, and CLX. For 1988, only a , 1.0-litre three-cylinder, fuel injected engine called the &quot;CB90&quot; was available. For 1989, the CLS and CLX also became available with the more powerful 1.3-litre four-cylinder SOHC 16-valve fuel injected, all-aluminum &quot;HC-E&quot; engine. This, along with the new availability of an automatic transmission and an expansion of dealerships, provided a useful boost to sales for the year.

For 1990, the trim levels were reduced to just two, the SE (base) and top trim package SX. The four-door sedan model was new for 1990. Four-cylinder models were available with a five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed automatic transmission, while three-cylinder models were offered with the manual transmission only. From 1988 to 1991, only 43,590 Charades were sold in the US.

===Australia===
In the Australian market, the GTti was unavailable and the turbocharged petrol Charade used the lower powered carbureted engine (CB61) from the previous generation. Quite a few GTtis and GT-XXs have been imported from Japan and have a good following. In Australia, the third generation was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings as providing &quot;worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash and the second generation was assessed as &quot;significantly worse than average&quot;.

=== Taiwanese assembly ===
Taiwanese assembly of the G100 began in 1989, although the Skywing liftback version of the G11 continued to be sold into 1990. It continued until local assembler Yu Tian went bankrupt in 1996 in the midst of a financial scandal.

=== Indonesian assembly ===

Daihatsu&#x27;s subsidiary in Indonesia, Astra Daihatsu Motor, that was also producing the G10 and G11 Charades for local market also producing the G100 Charade starting in 1987. Initially, it was only available as a 5-door hatchback with carbureted 1.0-litre three-cylinder &quot;CB23&quot; petrol engine from the previous generation with a single CX trim. This model did not have power windows, power steering, rear wiper, nor alloy wheels. In 1990, the 1.3-litre four-cylinder engined Winner 5-door hatchback and Classy SG Saloon sedan appeared. Unlike the basic CX, both Winner and Classy has better equipments such as power windows, power steering, electric mirrors, rear wiper for hatchback and alloy wheels. The facelifted hatchback model appeared in 1991 and the sales were stopped in 1993.

Due the high popularity of sedan segment in Indonesia before the 2000s, the Classy sedan continued to be produced with the same carbureted 1.3-litre &quot;HC-C&quot; four-cylinder engine. It was strange because the neighboring countries, such as Malaysia and Australia, received the more modern G200 Charade. In 1994, the Classy sedan received minor changes with the new honeycomb grill and small rear spoiler, sold as Classy Pro. In 1996, another minor changes with new dual tone colours and leather seats became available as Classy Royal until the production was stopped in 1998.

=== Competition ===

The G100 Charade had a limited albeit fairly successful rally career. Continuing its competitiveness in Safari Rally, it finished 2nd on its class or 12th overall behind Nissan March Turbo in 1988. It competed in the 1989 Lombard RAC Rally and finished at 4th place on its class or 32nd overall. In the 1990 Safari Rally, two Charade 1.3i models finished 1st and 2nd on its class, also 9th and 10th overall out of 59 contestants.

The GTti won another class honours in 1991 and 1992 Safari Rally and was able to mix it with some of the 2.0-litre cars and on occasion troubling some of the considerably more powerful 4WD cars. With the &quot;turbo factor&quot; increased to 1.7, the one-litre Charade was later forced into the same category as the 2.0-litre cars. The best result was in the 1993 Safari Rally, where Charade GT-XX models finished 5th, 6th, and 7th overall.
== Fourth generation (G200; 1993–2000) ==
The fourth generation was introduced in January 1993, again with hatchback and (later) sedan bodies. The design was more conservative than that of the third generation model. Being somewhat larger than the predecessor, in spite of a marginally longer wheelbase, it was still very compact. Although the 1.0-litre engines were no longer offered in most markets, the 1.0L remained available in Australia and also in Brazil, where a lower tax rate for vehicles equipped with engines displacing less than 1.0 litres was in effect at the time, in the G202 Charade.

The G202 came equipped with the &quot;CB24&quot; 1.0-litre engine. The heads and emission hose layout differ from those of the earlier &quot;CB23&quot;. The SOHC 1.3-litre became the base motor instead for most markets. The sedan, introduced in 1994, featured a 1.5-litre engine with optional 4WD. The bigger engines were available with hatchback bodywork. The four-wheel drive models received the G213 chassis code, while front-wheel-drive models had codes in the G200 range.

The diesel models were dropped in all markets where they had previously been available. In Australia, the fourth generation was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings as providing &quot;worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash and the second generation was assessed as &quot;significantly worse than average&quot;.

The turbocharged GTti version was replaced by a more conventional GTi with an SOHC 16-valve 1.6-litre engine. In the Japanese domestic market this version was named in honour of an Argentinian ex-racing driver Alejandro de Tomaso (the previous owner of Innocenti, who had worked closely with Daihatsu), including a racing-derived camshaft, and was capable of JIS in the Japanese market.

The export version, simply called &quot;GTi&quot;, was detuned to DIN. De Tomaso added their own bodykit, Recaro seats, a Nardi Torino steering wheel, and Pirelli sports tires. A total of 120,000 Charade GTis were produced following this joint effort.

The Charade was restyled in 1996, only two years after release. It now had a &quot;smiley face&quot; grille and changed headlights, looking more like its Toyota sibling, the Starlet. It was produced until 2000, when it was replaced by the Sirion and Storia.

== Nameplate use with other vehicles ==
In Australia, the name had previously been used for the L500 series of the Daihatsu Mira, which was sold there as the Daihatsu Charade Centro between March 1995 and 1998.

In 2003, the Charade name was resurrected in Europe, Australia, and South Africa, on a rebadged version of the Daihatsu Mira (L250). It was positioned one market segment below its previous generations and was available as a three- or five-door hatchback with a 1.0-litre inline-four engine. It has since been discontinued in Australia in 2006, due to Toyota retiring the Daihatsu nameplate there. The L250 series of the Daihatsu Mira was produced for other markets until 2007.

From 2007, Daihatsu in South Africa offered the Daihatsu Mira (L275) as the Charade in that market. Production ended around 2011.

Between 2011 and 2013, Daihatsu Europe sold the France-built Toyota Yaris (XP90) on the market as the Daihatsu Charade. This was the last Charade model introduced under the Daihatsu nameplate in Europe.

== Chinese copies and derivatives ==
The Tianjin Xiali TJ730, based on the G11 Charade was built by FAW Tianjin from knock-down kits from 1986 to 1988. It was then replaced by the Xiali TJ7100 and TJ7100U, which were both based on the G100 and G102, respectively. The hatchback commenced production in 1988, while the sedan arrived in October 1990 for the 1991 model year. Both variants were produced up to 1997 and 1999 respectively where facelifted versions with more modern Toyota engines were put into production. The Xiali N3 commenced production in 2004, was given a minor facelift for 2008, and was facelifted again in 2012, with production ending soon after. It, however, is still displayed on the Tianjin FAW website as of 2018.

Production for most versions ended in 2006. The TJ7101AU and TJ7141AU continued production and were also known as the Junya (Junior) (from 2005) and Shenya (Senior) (from 2003) and came equipped with the 1-litre Daihatsu-based TJ376QE three cylinder or a 1.4-litre engine known as the 4GB1 with four cylinders (from 2005 onwards). The Shenya and Junya were both given a facelift for 2006 and continued until production ended in 2011.

All Xiali-based Charades had a 4-speed manual on early models and later models with a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard. The Xiali brand was defunct in 2015.

The 1-litre TJ376QE engine came standard paired with a 4 speed manual gearbox. The MPV is 3750 millimetres long, 1580 millimetres wide, 1770 millimetres high and runs on a 2300 millimetre wheelbase. Kerb weight is 950 kilograms. The MPV was given a facelift in 2001 featuring a new set of lights and dashboard then ended production in 2003.

Chinese car brand China Motor Corporation, based in Beijing, made a car known as the Zhonghua with the codename CHB6401TA and was designed by Chinese designer Tang Jinsheng, with the body shape of made entirely out of plastic and was a licensed-built Tianjin Xiali derivative.

<text>Pádraig Peter Harrington (born 31 August 1971) is an Irish professional golfer who plays on the European Tour, PGA Tour and the PGA Tour Champions. He has won three major championships: The Open Championship in 2007 and 2008 and the PGA Championship, also in 2008. He spent over 300 weeks in the top-10 of the world rankings, and reached a career-high ranking of the third spot in July 2008. Harrington was a member of six consecutive Ryder Cup teams between 1999 and 2010. In 2024, he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Harrington was born in Dublin, Ireland, the youngest of five sons of Patrick and Breda Harrington. His father, &quot;Paddy&quot; (1933–2005), a Garda who played Gaelic football for Cork in the 1950s, was also a boxer and hurler, and played to a five handicap in golf.

He grew up in Rathfarnham, an area on Dublin&#x27;s southside and the birthplace of two other professional golfers, Paul McGinley and Peter Lawrie. Harrington attended the same local secondary school as McGinley (though not in the same year), giving their school, Coláiste Éanna, the unique distinction of having produced two Ryder Cup captains. Encouraged by his brothers and father, Harrington&#x27;s interest and passion for golf grew as he developed his game at nearby Stackstown G.C.

==Professional career==
===European Tour (1996–2007)===
After a successful amateur career, including winning the Walker Cup with the Great Britain &amp; Ireland team in his third appearance in 1995, Harrington turned professional later that year, joining the European Tour in 1996. Harrington came to professional golf at a relatively late age, having studied accountancy at university for a number of years while playing high-standard amateur golf. He was unsure whether to turn professional, initially doubting his skills.

His first victory came quickly, in the 1996 Peugeot Spanish Open, his 10th start on the European Tour. But for the next few years, the most remarkable thing about his career was the number of times he finished second in European Tour events without ever bettering that position, including four second-places in five events in late 1999. With these runners up finishes Harrington qualified to make his Ryder Cup debut in 1999. During this period outside of the European Tour circuit Harrington won the 1998 Irish PGA Championship.

However, in 2000 Harrington discovered a winning touch with two European Tour wins at the Brazil São Paulo 500 Years Open in April, and the BBVA Open Turespaña Masters Comunidad de Madrid in October. With these wins Harrington finished 7th on the European Tour Order of Merit for the second time equaling his 1999 finish. In 2001, Harrington won his fourth tournament on the European Tour at the Volvo Masters Andalucia, this win and 6 runners up finishes in 2001 lifted Harrington to a then career-high year-end finish of second on the European Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit.

2002 was another successful year on the European Tour with particular success towards the end of the season including winning at the Dunhill Links Championship in October, having birdied the final hole to get into a playoff with Eduardo Romero. This win and a further 9 top ten finishes earned Harrington a second-place finish on the European Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit for the second consecutive season. This form earned Harrington a second Ryder Cup appearance at the 2002 Ryder Cup hosted at The Belfry, in the final day singles Harrington, playing in match 5, won an important point against Mark Calcavecchia helping Europe to victory and regain the cup by a score of 15.5 to 12.5.

Harrington continued this winning form into 2003 winning the first event of the 2003 season at the BMW Asian Open in November 2002. Following Harrington&#x27;s success in 2001 and 2002 he was invited to, and won, the 2002 Target World Challenge, an unofficial event in the USA hosted by Tiger Woods, whilst this is not a PGA Tour event it marked Harrington&#x27;s first win in the United States. His winning form continued into the new year winning the Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe in May 2003. With these two wins Harrington finished third on the 2003 European Tour Order of Merit.

Harrington won a further two events on the European tour in 2004 at the Omega Hong Kong Open in December 2003 and the Linde German Masters in September 2004. Harrington finished the season 3rd on the European Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit, this was the 4th consecutive year in which he was within the year end top-5 and the 6th consecutive year in the top-10. Harrington once again qualified for the 2004 Ryder Cup, hosted at Oakland Hills Country Club where he was part of a European team that defeated the United States by the largest winning margin by a European team in the history of the event.

In 2005 having joined the PGA Tour (see below), Harrington played fewer events on the European Tour and experienced his first winless year on the tour since 1999. In 2006 Harrington was once again a winner on the European Tour at the 2006 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, this was his second links golf win having also won the event in 2002 and was a prelude for his future Open Championship success. Following this Harrington won the 2006 European Tour Order of Merit, coming after a titanic battle with Paul Casey and David Howell, which was won on the last hole of the last event. Sergio García bogeyed the 72nd hole in the season-ending Volvo Masters to give Harrington a share of second place which earned him enough money to leapfrog Paul Casey to 1st place on the Order of Merit.

In 2007 Harrington won the Irish Open for the first time, in doing so Harrington became the first home winner of the Irish Open for 25 years.

Harrington won the European Tour Golfer of the Year award in 2007 and 2008.

In both 2003 and 2004 he was the runner-up in The Players Championship, and in the latter year, he won enough money on the PGA Tour as a non-member to earn an invitation to the end of season Tour Championship.

===PGA Tour===
He took membership of the PGA Tour in 2005 and in March he won his first PGA Tour official money event at the Honda Classic, where he beat Vijay Singh and Joe Ogilvie in a sudden-death playoff. In late June, Harrington snatched the Barclays Classic from Jim Furyk with a spectacular eagle putt on the final hole for his second PGA Tour win. Two weeks later his father died from oesophageal cancer on 11 July, the Monday night preceding the 2005 Open Championship, forcing Harrington&#x27;s withdrawal.

Harrington spent over 300 weeks in the world top ten between 2001 and 2010. and achieved his best ranking of third following his second Open Championship victory. He has also played for Europe in six Ryder Cups; losing in 1999 and 2008, but winning in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2010. He has also won the par-3 contest at Augusta National, held the day before The Masters, in 2003 (tie), 2004 and 2012 (tie).

====Major championship breakthrough====

At the 2007 Open Championship, Harrington defeated Sergio García in a four-hole playoff at Carnoustie Golf Links, becoming the first Irishman to win The Open Championship in 60 years, and the first ever from the Republic of Ireland. Both players went into the playoff having shot a 7-under 277 for the championship. Harrington subsequently won by one stroke in the playoff.

A year later at the 2008 Open Championship, it was unclear if he would get a chance to defend his Open title at Royal Birkdale as eight days prior to the event he injured his wrist. But Harrington successfully defended his title, overcoming a 2-shot deficit to Greg Norman with a final round 69. He shot a four-under-par 32 on the back nine, which enabled him to pull away from Norman and Ian Poulter. His eagle on the par-5 17th all but sealed the tournament. He is the first European golfer since James Braid in 1906 to retain the Claret Jug. The win moved him from fourteenth to third in the world rankings, behind only Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.

Just three weeks after winning the Open Championship, Harrington won the PGA Championship over the South Course of the Oakland Hills Country Club, for his third major. Although at five over par after two rounds, he shot eight under par for the weekend, carding successive scores of 66 in the third and fourth rounds. His three under par 277 was two shots ahead of Sergio García and Ben Curtis. Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years (Tommy Armour in 1930), and was the first winner from Ireland.

Aside from Tiger Woods, who has won consecutive majors three times (2000, 2002, and 2006), Harrington was the first golfer to win two majors in the same year since Mark O&#x27;Meara in 1998 and the first to win consecutive majors in the same year since Nick Price in 1994. This feat has since been achieved by Rory McIlroy in 2014, winning the Open Championship and PGA Championship, as well as Jordan Spieth who won the Masters and the U.S. Open in 2015. Harrington&#x27;s victory in the PGA Championship secured his position as the number one player in Europe, earning him a spot in the 2008 European Ryder Cup team under captain Nick Faldo.

===2009: First winless year for a decade===
Harrington started his 2009 season with a tied-fifth finish in the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship on the European Tour. He then went through a tough period in his career, missing the cut at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, as well as the Northern Trust Open on the PGA Tour. He finished tied-11th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in what would be one of his better results in the early part of 2009. He arrived at the 2009 Masters Tournament hoping to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive professional majors. Harrington started with a 3-under-par first round, but eventually faded over the weekend, finishing tied for 35th place. His struggles continued in the succeeding months, as he missed the cut at five of his next six events, including The 3 Irish Open and the U.S. Open. It was during this period that he announced that he was working on swing changes with coach Bob Torrance.

Harrington arrived at The Open Championship at Turnberry hoping to complete a hat-trick of Open wins, a feat that has only been achieved since the 1880s by Peter Thomson. He ended up finishing tied for 65th place. At the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational he was involved in a final day head-to-head between himself and World number one Tiger Woods. Harrington led by one shot playing the 16th hole, but he racked up a triple-bogey to Woods&#x27; birdie and he finished in joint 2nd place. The following week Harrington, the defending champion, played the first two rounds with Woods at the PGA Championship. He shot a first-round 68, ending one shot behind the leader Woods. Rounds of 73 and 69 left him two shots behind Woods. He was in contention in the final round, until he made an 8 at the par-3 8th hole. He ended in a tie for 10th. He finished in the top 10 in all four FedEx Cup playoff events, before further top-10s in Europe and the States before the end of the season. He ended the year winless on the European and PGA Tours for the first time since 1999.

===2010–present===

Harrington missed the cut in three out of the four majors in 2010. In an inconsistent season, he had five top-10s on the PGA Tour but also missed six cuts. He was a controversial wild-card pick by European captain Colin Montgomerie for the 2010 Ryder Cup. He won two matches and lost two matches as Europe regained the Ryder Cup. It was his sixth Ryder Cup and fourth time being on the winning team. He won his first tournament in two years at the Iskandar Johor Open in Malaysia on the Asian Tour. He finished the year ranked 25th in the world.

Harrington started his 2011 season with an opening round 65, for a first-round lead at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on the European Tour. He was later disqualified before his second round commenced, after a spectator telephoned in and pointed out an incident of his ball moving an exceptionally small distance closer to the hole on the green, while he was replacing his ball marker, during the first round; it had been shown on television. (The incident led to a rules review, and if it were to occur again, there would not be a penalty.) He missed the cut at the Masters Tournament and finished tied for 45th at the U.S. Open. In June 2011, he dropped outside the top 50 in the World Rankings for the first time since 1999.

Harrington made his first start of the 2012 PGA Tour season at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am where he finished joint top of the Pro-Am leaderboard, alongside partner J.P. McManus, with Brian Harman and Greg Ontiveros. Harrington also enjoyed a good finish in the overall tournament with a tied for seventh finish. In March 2012, Harrington shot a 61 in the first round of the Transitions Championship to set a new course record at the Copperhead Course. This was also Harrington&#x27;s lowest-ever round on the PGA Tour. He could not maintain his brilliant first day&#x27;s play over the remaining three rounds though and finished in a tie for 20th place. In April 2012, at the first major of the year, The Masters, Harrington shot five under for the last six holes in his third round to close to within three shots of the lead. In the final round, he shot a level par round of 72 to finish tied for 8th. It was Harrington&#x27;s first top-10 finish in a major since the 2009 PGA Championship.

At the 2012 U.S. Open, Harrington was in contention to win a fourth major championship, when rounds of 74-70-71 on the first three days got him into contention on Sunday. After bogeying two of the first six holes, Harrington played the stretch from hole 7–17 in 5-under-par to find himself two behind the leader. Needing a birdie at the last to finish ahead of the clubhouse leader Michael Thompson, Harrington took the pin on at the 18th and found a plugged lie in the greenside bunker, which resulted in a bogey finish at 3-over-par. Ultimately this did not cost him the championship as he finished two shots behind Webb Simpson on 1-over-par. Harrington later stated that he thought he had to birdie the last to get to 1-over-par as the reason for taking such an aggressive line on the 18th. He eventually finished in a tie for fourth place, which represented his best showing at a U.S. Open.

In October 2012 Harrington won the PGA Grand Slam of Golf despite having not won a major championship during the year, having been a late replacement for Open champion Ernie Els. Harrington endured difficult 2013 and 2014 seasons finishing outside of the top 60 on the European Tour Race to Dubai in both years and outside of the top 130 on the PGA Tour FedEx Cup in both years. During this period his Official World Golf Ranking fell to an 18-year low of 385 as of 1 December 2014. In December 2014 he won the Bank BRI Indonesia Open on the Asian Tour for his first official win for 4 years.

In March 2015, Harrington won his first title on the European or PGA Tours in seven years at the Honda Classic. He defeated rookie Daniel Berger on the second extra hole of a sudden-death playoff. Harrington had started the 2014–15 season without full playing privileges after finishing 188th in the FedEx Cup. Harrington was the second consecutive player ranked 297th in the world to win on the PGA Tour, after James Hahn won the Northern Trust Open the week before. The victory qualified Harrington for the Masters having missed out on the event in 2014 for the first time since he made his debut in 2000. This also moved him back into the world&#x27;s top 100. In August 2016, Harrington represented Ireland at the 2016 Summer Olympics, finishing in a tie for the 21st place. On 23 October 2016, Harrington won the Portugal Masters by one stroke. It was his first win on the European Tour since 2008.

On 8 January 2019, Harrington was named as the captain for the 2020 Ryder Cup. The Ryder Cup was delayed one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The European team lost 19–9.

In 2022, Harrington started playing on PGA Tour Champions. He finished second to Steve Stricker in his first senior major, The Tradition. On 26 June 2022, he won his first senior major, the U.S. Senior Open, beating Stricker by one stroke.

In March 2023 it was announced that Harrington would be elected World Golf Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2024.

<text>Jonathan A. Drummond (born September 9, 1968) is an American athlete, winner of gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jon Drummond, a graduate of Overbrook High School, is known for being among the world&#x27;s best starters. He is also well known for what could be called showmanship or taunting depending on one&#x27;s perspective. Drummond has been called the &quot;Clown Prince&quot; of Track and Field.

His &quot;showmanship&quot; was visible with his membership in the HSI enclave, along with training partners Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon.

In 1991, Drummond won the 200 m at the World University Games. At the 1993 World Championships, Drummond ran the opening leg on the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the gold medal and equalled the world record of 37.40. At the 1995 World Championships, he ran the second leg on the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which did not finish its heat after Drummond and Tony McCall failed to complete their pass.

Drummond was the opening leg of the silver medal-winning American 4 × 100 m relay team at the 1996 Summer Olympics and reached the semi-finals of 100 m. In 1997, Drummond won his only US National Championships title in 200 m and at the World Championships, Drummond was seventh in 200 m. In 1999, Drummond suffered a third case of spinal meningitis but managed to recover to run the opening leg in a gold medal-winning American 4 × 100 m relay team at the 1999 World Championships.

At the Sydney Olympics, Drummond was fifth in 100 m and ran again the opening leg on the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the gold medal. At the 2001 World Championships, Drummond was again selected to run the first leg in relay, but suffered a torn right quadriceps halfway to passing the baton to Mickey Grimes in the first round and did not run in the final. He did however complete the pass to Grimes in first place allowing the team to continue onto the finals.

In 2002, Drummond was fourth in 100 m and won the 4 × 100 m relay in the IAAF World Cup.

At the 2003 World Championships, he was disqualified in the quarterfinals of 100 m for a false start. However, he contested that he did not false start, repeatedly shouting &quot;I did not move&quot;. He delayed competition for almost an hour by refusing to leave the Paris track where the meet was being held. He protested for a period of time by lying down on the track. He eventually left the track of his own volition, reportedly in tears. It is one of a number of cases which relate to the revised false-start policies.

==After retirement==
At the 2012 London Olympics, Drummond was the relay coach for the U.S. Track Team. The men&#x27;s 4x100 metres relay team equalled the existing world record in the Olympics, though were defeated by a new world record by Jamaica. The women&#x27;s team won and crushed the world record. In an event where improvements are normally recorded in hundredths of a second, the team knocked more than a half a second off the record that had stood for more than a quarter of a century.

Drummond worked as a fitness trainer at Daired&#x27;s Pangea Spa in Arlington, Texas. He also formerly coached sprinter Tyson Gay.

He is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and was formerly a member of Kirk Franklin&#x27;s gospel group The Family.

He has also followed in his minister father&#x27;s footsteps as pastor at Noville Memorial Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia.

He was Inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2014.

In 2014, Tyson Gay, Drummond&#x27;s former athlete tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Drummond was implicated, as it was alleged Drummond &quot;encouraged his use of the banned products and transported them for him.&quot; The investigation resulted in an eight-year ban from the sport for Drummond. Drummond was banned until December 16, 2022.

<doc id="1157773" wikidata="Q3397480" url="?curid=1157773" title="Llanymynech">
<text>Llanymynech is a village and former civil parish straddling the border between Montgomeryshire/Powys, Wales, and Shropshire, England, about north of the Welsh town of Welshpool. The name is Welsh for &quot;Llan of the Monks&quot;. The village is on the banks of the River Vyrnwy, and the Montgomery Canal passes through it.

The border runs for the most part along the frontages of the buildings on the east (English) side of the village&#x27;s main street, with the eastern half of the village in England and the western half in Wales. The Church of England parish church of St Agatha lies just in England, although the entire village lies in the same ecclesiastical parish. The border also passed right through the now closed Lion pub, which had two bars in Shropshire and one in Montgomeryshire. At one time Welsh counties were referred to as &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot; depending on whether people could drink in pubs on Sundays. When Montgomeryshire was dry it was legal to drink on Sundays in the two English bars of the Lion but not the Welsh bar. Two of the remaining open pubs in the village are entirely in England and the third is entirely in Wales.

Just to the north of the village is Pant. Further north is the English market town of Oswestry. The community of Llanymynech and Pant had a population of 1,675 as of the 2011 census.

==History==
Llanymynech Hill is one of Wales&#x27; earliest mining sites. Evidence suggests that copper was mined and smelted here in the late Bronze Age, and that the metal was used to make bronze weapons and other implements. The hill above Llanymynech is crowned with an extensive Iron Age hillfort, which extends over 57 hectares (140 acres), and surrounds a cave opening known as the Ogof. The size of this hillfort is probably explained by the presence of the copper mines. The hillfort would have served as protection for the mine, and housed the labourers employed in the extraction of copper.

The Bronze Age British miners would have used fire-setting mining techniques, but with the arrival of the Romans the cavern was extended and more extensively mined. According to the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust, before the hill was landscaped for the current golf course, at least ten shafts were visible on the southern part of the hill, together with a large number of shallow pits and shaft-mounds. The main entrance to the mine is still the Ogof. A number of Roman artefacts have been found in the mine including a number of bones and burials, and a hoard of 30 first and second century silver coins of Roman currency found in 1965 by some schoolboys, now conserved at the National Museum of Wales. The mine was probably abandoned c. 200 AD.

In Anglo-Saxon times, Offa&#x27;s Dyke was built c. 430 and 652, through what is probably the main street in Llanymynech, on the east side of the road. It is thought the west wall of St Agatha&#x27;s churchyard was built on the raised part of the dyke. Today, the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path passes through the village.

Under the Normans, the village came under the rule of a Marcher Lord (a Lord of the March or border counties), and a fortification called Carreghofa Castle was built by the Earl of Shrewsbury around 1101. The place where the castle was probably built, at Tanat Camp, just to the west of Llanymynech Hill and overlooking the Tanat valley, implies it was defending the hill which was being mined for copper and lead, as well as silver. Being situated in the borderlands, the castle changed hands between the English and Welsh numerous times during the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1187 the castle was captured by Owain Fychan, prince of Powys, who was then murdered at the castle by his cousins Gwenwynwyn and Cadwallon.

In 1194, the castle was recaptured by the English with the intention of reopening the mines on Llanymynech Hill and extracting silver. Richard I had been captured and held for a ransom of £100,000, and the Bishop of Salisbury, Hubert Walter, heard of the discovery of silver at the Carreghofa Mine on Llanymynech Hill; he decided to develop the mine and reopen the mint at Shrewsbury to refine the silver and make it into coins. However the total amount of silver produced only came to the value of £20, 11 shillings and 11 pence. This mine was located north of the present quarry, and just south of the present golf course clubhouse. In the 1230s, the castle was destroyed and the stones were eventually removed and used to construct nearby Carreghofa Hall. Very little remains of the castle today.
===Recent times===
The Welsh Church Act 1914 disestablished the Church in Wales from the Church of England. During the period while the enactment was delayed by the Suspensory Act 1914, and even though the parish church is situated on the English side of the border, because the ecclesiastical parish straddled the border, Llanymynech was one of the nineteen border parishes that were balloted by the Welsh Church Commissioners to decide whether it should remain with the Church of England or join the disestablished Church in Wales. The parishioners of Llanymynech voted in 1915 by 315 to 130 to remain part of the Church of England. The parish therefore ceased to be part of the Welsh Diocese of St Asaph, and was transferred to the Diocese of Lichfield, so remaining part of the Church of England.

The two halves of Llanymynech were subject to different restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Wales and England set different legal restrictions on travel and business.

==Governance==
The English–Welsh border runs through the village, approximately following the A483 through the village. Therefore, Llanymynech is served by both an English and a Welsh service for everything. Dyfed-Powys Police cover the Welsh side of the village, West Mercia Police cover the English side; Powys County Council are responsible for waste collection, recycling, and other council services on the Welsh side, Shropshire Council on the English side, and so on.

The English part of the village is in the civil parish of Llanymynech and Pant, and in the electoral ward of Llanymynech in Shropshire. This ward had a population at the 2011 census of 3,988. The 2011 census output area covering the English part of the village has a population of 477.

The Welsh part of the village is in the community of Carreghofa in Powys. The 2011 census output area covering the Welsh part of the village has a population of 323 of whom 29% could speak, read and write Welsh.

In 1961 the parish of Llanymynech had a population of 763. On 1 April 1967 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Llanymynech and Pant&quot;.

==Features==
Llanymynech Hill is now the site of Llanymynech Golf Club perched on top of the cliffs, whose 18-hole course is the only one in Europe to straddle a country border, being partly in England and partly in Wales.

The village is home to one of only three remaining Hoffmann kilns in the British Isles, and the only one with a chimney. The kiln at Llanymynech was used for lime burning. The area around the kiln is designated as the Llanymynech Heritage Area.

The former limestone quarry which fed the kiln is now the Shropshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s Llanymynech Rocks Nature Reserve, and its cliff face is popular with rock climbers.

==Transport==
Due to the local limestone and mineral deposits, Llanymynech became a transport hub.

First to arrive was a branch of the Ellesmere Canal, where it joined the eastern section of the Montgomeryshire Canal at Carreghofa. Today the canal is known as the Montgomery Canal, and the section through Llanymynech is isolated, with an section being navigable to boats. To the north to Pant the canal is dry; to the south the canal is isolated by lowered bridges.

The main line of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (O&amp;NR) arrived from the south in 1860, a later constituent part of the Cambrian Railways (CR). In 1863, the Cambrian completed the construction of the Llanfyllin branch, a railway constructed to enable distribution of minerals in competition with the canal. Stipulated in the authorising act of parliament to avoid flat crossing of the existing canal and Tanat Valley Light Railway (TVLR), bridges had to be constructed to enable operations.

The later Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway (Potts), which ran to , originally ran under the O&amp;NR and the canal to enable the Nantmawr branch for similar mineral extraction purposes. However, after it ran into financial difficulties, the CR took over the Nantmawr branch, agreeing to rebuild the southern end of the Potts so that it now formed a junction through Llanymynech.

After failing to create a junction with the GWR and the LNWR at Shrewsbury, the Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway suffered from low traffic and continual financial difficulties, having now also lost its main revenue stream from the Nantmawr branch. Taken over by the GWR under the Railways Act 1921, it was again closed to passengers on 6 November 1933, but remained open as a military freight route until 1960.

The Cambrian Railways mainline from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965 in favour of the more viable Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway route. This also resulted in the closure of the Llanfyllin branch. The Nantmawr branch remained in operation until the 1998, with the track from Oswestry still in place today.

Although no railway now serves Llanymynech, both the Cambrian Heritage Railways and the enthusiast-revived TVLR plan to reconnect Llanymynech with their heritage railway schemes.

The A483 trunk road is the main road through the centre of Llanymynech. A bypass was announced in the 2020 budget.

Since Wales reduced most of its built-up area speed limits in September 2023, the Welsh side of the village including the A483 has been subject to a 20 mph speed limit. However, the English side of the village still remains subject to a 30 mph speed limit.

A football club was formed in the village as far back as May 1858 in a field near Glanverniew House on the English side of the border. There is no further mention of a football club in the village until November 1879 when a club was formed following a meeting at the school room.

Llanymynech F.C. was reformed in 2011. They currently compete in Shropshire County Football League Division One, into which they were elected in 2022. They play their home games at Station Road on the English side of the village and play in a kit consisting of red shirt, red shorts and white- and red-hooped socks.

<text>Florence Ann Griswold (December 25, 1850 – December 6, 1937) was a resident of Old Lyme, Connecticut, United States who became the nucleus of the &quot;Old Lyme Art Colony&quot; in the early 20th century. Her home has since been made into the Florence Griswold Museum, a National Historic Landmark.

==Life and work==

Florence Griswold was the youngest daughter of Helen Powers Griswold and ship captain Robert Harper Griswold. As one of Old Lyme’s oldest and richest families, the Griswolds enjoyed a privileged life until economic difficulties changed the family’s fortunes. Helen decided to convert the family home to a finishing school for young ladies and opened the Griswold Home School for Girls in 1878 where Florence, along with her mother and two sisters, taught. Throughout her life, Florence would continue to confront financial difficulties, and by the late 1890s, she found herself alone on the family homestead. She transformed the school into a boarding house and began to rent rooms for $7 per week.

In 1899, artist Henry Ward Ranger, recently returned from Europe and inspired by the example of the French Barbizon artists, rented a room from Griswold (who is still affectionately referred to as &#x27;Miss Florence&#x27; in Old Lyme) and encouraged his acquaintances to do likewise. Over 135 American artists boarded in the Florence Griswold House from 1899 through the 1930s and were invited to paint a panel on the walls or doors of the house. Over 43 panels now adorn the house, with a concentration in the Dining Room.

Childe Hassam arrived in 1903 and he, in turn, invited Willard Metcalf, who arrived in 1905. Among the women artists who stayed and painted at Miss Florence&#x27;s were Matilda Browne and sisters Lydia and Breta Longacre. Many other American Impressionist painters summered at the colony, in Griswold&#x27;s house, among them Wilson Irvine, who arrived in 1914. Also, Edward Charles Volkert who became known as &quot;America&#x27;s cattle painter&quot;, and William Henry Howe, another cattle painter, who there was referred to as &quot;Uncle&quot; because of his age. Ellen Axson Wilson, first wife of president Woodrow Wilson, came as an art student and became friends with Griswold; in 1914 Griswold attended the wedding of Presidential daughter Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre. Many American impressionist paintings of the era are of subjects in and around the Griswold house.

Looking back on this era of artistic prosperity, Griswold commented in 1937, &quot;So you see, first the artists adopted Lyme, and then Lyme adopted the artists, and now, today, Lyme and art are synonymous.&quot;

A portion of Griswold&#x27;s land was purchased by the Lyme Art Association in 1917 so that a gallery could be built. She became its first manager when it opened in 1921.

==Florence Griswold Museum==

Old Lyme resident Harry Hoffman helped to save Griswold&#x27;s house through a fund-raising campaign so that it could be converted into a museum. First called the Florence Griswold House, it is now known as the Florence Griswold Museum. Located at 96 Lyme Street in Old Lyme, the house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. In July 2007 the building reopened after a 14-month restoration project.

The museum exhibits both American art and historical material. Its collection spans fine art, sculpture, works on paper, artist&#x27;s studio material, toys and dolls, ceramics, furniture, textiles, decorative arts and historic artifacts, and the Lyme Historical Society archives.
