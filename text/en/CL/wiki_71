<text>The London Transport Museum (LTM) is a transport museum based in Covent Garden, London. The museum predominantly hosts exhibits relating to the heritage of London&#x27;s transport, as well as conserving and explaining the history of it. The majority of the museum&#x27;s exhibits originated in the collections of London Transport, but, since the creation of Transport for London (TfL) in 2000, the remit of the museum has expanded to cover all aspects of transport in the city and in some instances beyond.

The museum operates from two sites within London. The main site in Covent Garden uses the name of its parent institution, and is open to the public every day, excluding over Christmas, having reopened in 2007 after a two-year refurbishment. The other site, located in Acton, is the London Transport Museum Depot and is principally a storage site of historic artefacts that is open to the public on scheduled visitor days throughout the year.

The museum also runs a programme of guided tours, Hidden London, which takes visitors to part of the London Underground that are typically closed to the public, including disused stations and wartime shelters.

The museum was briefly renamed London&#x27;s Transport Museum to reflect its coverage of topics beyond London Transport, but it reverted to its previous name in 2007 to coincide with the reopening of the Covent Garden site.

In July 2024, the Museum unveiled new branding in an attempt to reflect its coverage of all of London&#x27;s transport system, not exclusively buses and trains. The new logo - still of roundel design - incorporates all the colours of TfL&#x27;s transport modes.

==Museum (Covent Garden)==

The museum&#x27;s main facility is located in a Victorian iron and glass building that had formed part of the Covent Garden vegetable, fruit and flower market. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers in 1871 and is located between Russell Street, Tavistock Street, Wellington Street and the east side of the former market square. The market moved out in 1971, and the building was reopened as the London Transport Museum on 28 March 1980. The collection had been located at Syon Park since 1973 and before that had formed part of the British Transport Museum at Clapham.

On 4 September 2005 the museum closed for a £22 million refurbishment designed by Bryan Avery of Avery Associates Architects to enable the expansion of the display collection to encompass the larger remit of TfL which administers all forms of public transport. Enhanced educational facilities were also required. The museum reopened on 22 November 2007.

The entrance to the museum is from the Covent Garden Piazza. The museum is within walking distance from both Covent Garden Underground station and Charing Cross railway station.

==Collection==

The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the London Electric Railway (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London&#x27;s current transport authority.

The collection has had a number of homes. It was housed as part of the Museum of British Transport at a disused tram depot in Clapham High Street (now a supermarket) from 1963 to 1972, and then at Syon Park in Brentford from 1973 to 1977, before being moved to Covent Garden in 1980. Most of the other exhibits moved to York on formation of the National Railway Museum in 1975.

The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, trolleybuses and rail vehicles from 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population. The first underground electric train, from 1890, can be seen here.

Larger exhibits held at Acton depot include a complete 1938 stock tube train as well as early locomotives from the first sub-surface and first deep-level lines.

== Hidden London ==
In 2015 the museum launched a programme of guided tours under the name Hidden London. Tours of disused stations had previously been run by the museum since the 1990s, with one-off events taking place during the 2010s.

The tours give visitors exclusive access to parts of the London underground network that are usually closed to the public and cover the history of London through its underground network. They are written using findings from the museum’s extensive archives and collection.

Locations explored include disused stations Aldwych and Down Street, as well as secret parts of Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross and Euston stations; and a wartime deep level shelter in Clapham South. In 2023, a tour of Baker Street underground station was added to the programme in celebration of the 160th anniversary of the London Underground. In 2024 the museum launched tour &quot;Holborn: The Secret Platforms.&quot;

A new tour, &quot;Dover Street: Alight here for Green Park&quot;, will also start in January 2025.

There are also a series of virtual tours available, as well as a walking tour which covers the area surrounding the museum.

Profits from Hidden London tours are used to support the museum&#x27;s charitable activities as an education and heritage charity.

== Other attractions ==
As of 2022, the museum offers three simulator experiences: One Elizabeth Line simulator featuring a cab, a stand-up smaller version of the later, and a 1938 stock simulator complete with deadman&#x27;s handle.

A Hidden London exhibition ran until July 2023, featuring a sized-down, walkthrough replica of the Aldwych Ticket Hall and Down Street Blitz Shelter which Winston Churchill used during World War II. The exhibition told the story of some of London&#x27;s abandoned stations and hidden transport infrastructure of which the museum offers some tours of.

There is the Children&#x27;s interactive area complete with Optare bus and the All Aboard play-zone for 0-7 year olds.

==Museum shop==
The museum shop sells a wide range of books, reproduction posters, models, gifts and souvenirs, both at Covent Garden and online. Profits from sales support the museum&#x27;s activities.

==Museum Depot (Acton)==

The Museum Depot is located in Acton, west London, and was opened in October 1999. The depot holds the majority of the museum&#x27;s collections which are not on display in the main museum in Covent Garden. It is the base for the museum&#x27;s curators and conservators, and is used for the display of items too large to be accommodated in the main facility.

The depot provides 6,000 square metres of storage space in secure, environmentally controlled conditions and houses over 370,000 items of all types, including many original works of art used for the museum&#x27;s collections of posters, signs, models, photographs, engineering drawings and uniforms. The building has both road access and a rail connection to the London Underground network, which allows the storage and display of significant numbers of buses, trams, trolleybuses, rail rolling stock and other vehicles.

The depot is not regularly open to the public, but is fully equipped to receive visitors, with ticket office, shop, a miniature railway, and other visitor facilities. It opens to the public for pre-booked guided tours on several dates each month, and also for special events, including themed open weekends – usually three times per year. It is within easy walking distance of Acton Town Underground station.

<doc id="1179436" wikidata="Q4970917" url="?curid=1179436" title="British Rail Classes 316 and 457">
<text>Class 316 and Class 457 were TOPS classifications assigned to a single electric multiple unit (EMU) at different stages of its use as a prototype for the Networker series.

==Project==
In the late 1980s, the Network SouthEast division of British Rail, which operated the railway network in South East England, started to develop a new standard train, known as the &quot;Networker&quot;. To test out the technical arrangements for the &quot;Networker&quot;, a test train was used, converted from former Class 210 carriages, which were built in 1982 by Derby Litchurch Lane Works as prototype &#x27;Second Generation&#x27; Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU), but were withdrawn after a few years.

===Class 457===
Initially the test unit was formed for trials on the system of the Southern Region, and was numbered 457001. As with all Southern Region electric multiple units only the last four digits of the unit number were actually carried.
The unit formation was:
===Class 316===
Later, the unit was altered to undertake trials on the overhead line system used on electrified lines north of the River Thames. The unit was renumbered as a Class 316 unit, number 316999. To enable it to work on the AC electrification, a pantograph trailer from a Class 313 unit 313034 was inserted into the set, replacing one of the intermediate trailers. This spare vehicle (no. 67400) has since been incorporated into a Class 455/9 DC suburban unit, replacing a damaged Trailer Second Open (TSO) vehicle.

The unit formation was:
===Preservation===
After the AC trials were complete, the set was returned to the Southern Region for storage, minus the Class 313 trailer, which returned to its previous formation. The two driving cars were preserved at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire, one being resold to the Eversholt Rail Group and inserted into set 455913 in 2013 after being rebuilt at Wolverton railway works to replace a carriage destroyed in an accident. The vehicle (67301) was converted to a 455 MSO. The remaining intermediate trailer was scrapped.

Vehicle details are shown below:


==Alternative uses of the Class 316 number==
Class 316 was originally reserved in the British Rail Fleet List for an AC EMU for the Piccadilly to Victoria (Picc-Vic) underground line proposed for Manchester in the 1970s. The specifications and some outline design proposals for the new fleet was prepared at the Railway Technical Centre but never proceeded to tender with the project cancelled.

The Class 316 designation was also used in 1992 for a three car Class 307 EMU used as a testbed unit for new traction equipment.

<doc id="1179438" wikidata="Q720861" url="?curid=1179438" title="Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin">
<text>Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin (Sunne parish, Jämtlands län 11 September 1717 (OS) – Stockholm 13 December 1783), Swedish astronomer and demographer.

Wargentin was the son of the vicar of Sunne Wilhelm Wargentin (1670–1735) and his spouse Christina Aroselia, and the great-grandson of Joachim Wargentin (1611–1682), a Lübeck-born burgher of Åbo (Turku) in Finland.

When Pehr Wargentin was 12 years old he observed a (total) lunar eclipse which would spark his lifelong interest in Astronomy. During his tenure at Frösö &quot;trivialskola&quot; (elementary school), his teacher deemed him advanced enough to continue directly to Uppsala University. However, Wargentin&#x27;s father wanted him first to attend the &quot;gymnasium&quot; (secondary school) of Härnösand, which he did. According to his own account, Wargentin was unimpressed with the purely classical and theological curriculum and the lack of any education in the sciences and did not finish the fourth year.

In 1735, Wargentin matriculated as a student at the University of Uppsala, where he excelled. Olof Hiorter was one of his instructors. He graduated with the degree of filosofie magister (then the highest degree awarded in the Faculty of Arts) in 1743 and became a docent in astronomy in 1746 and an adjunct in 1748. He was called to Stockholm as secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749 on the death of secretary Pehr Elvius, Jr., and stayed on this post until his death. Wargentin therefore became the first long-serving secretary of the academy, which had been founded in 1739. He is seen as an important person in leading the academy to its first golden era. Wargentin also became the first director of the Stockholm Observatory founded by the Academy of Sciences on the initiative of his predecessor, Elvius, and completed in 1753. In 1756 Wargentin married Christina Magdalena Raab, a marriage that would produce three daughters until his wife&#x27;s death due to a miscarriage in 1769. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.

Wargentin made studies on the moons of Jupiter and published his first paper on the topic in 1741 in the &quot;Acta&quot; of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala.

The crater Wargentin on the Moon is named after him, as is the secondary school &quot;Wargentinsskolan&quot; in Östersund, Jämtland, with a historical continuity going back to the school Wargentin himself attended on Frösön.

In his later career, Wargentin&#x27;s focus shifted from astronomy to demography. The Swedish government decreed in 1736 that the clergy should maintain registers of all births and deaths in their parishes, and the concept emerged in the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences that these parish data should be subjected to national analysis. Wargentin was assigned to lead this task nationally in 1754, and subsequently published a number of demographic articles in the Transactions of the Swedish Royal Academy, in particular “Mortaliteten i Sverige, i anledning af Tabell-Verket”.

<doc id="1179445" wikidata="Q260011" url="?curid=1179445" title="Geraldine Brooks (writer)">
<text>Geraldine Brooks (born 14 September 1955) is an Australian American journalist and novelist whose 2005 novel &quot;March&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

== Early life ==
A native of Sydney, Geraldine Brooks grew up in its inner-west suburb of Ashfield. Her father, Lawrie Brooks, was an American big-band singer who was stranded in Adelaide on a tour of Australia when his manager absconded with the band&#x27;s pay; he decided to remain in Australia, and became a newspaper sub-editor. Her mother Gloria, from Boorowa, was a public relations officer with radio station 2GB in Sydney. She attended Bethlehem College, a secondary school for girls, and the University of Sydney. Following graduation, she was a rookie reporter for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and, after winning a Greg Shackleton Memorial Scholarship, moved to the United States, completing a master&#x27;s degree at New York City&#x27;s Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1983. The following year, in the Southern France artisan village of Tourrettes-sur-Loup, she married American journalist Tony Horwitz and converted to Judaism.

== Career ==
As a foreign correspondent for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, she covered crises in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. The stories from the Persian Gulf that she and her husband reported in 1990 received the Overseas Press Club&#x27;s Hal Boyle Award for &quot;Best Newspaper or Wire Service Reporting from Abroad&quot;. In 2006, she was awarded a fellowship at Harvard University&#x27;s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

Brooks&#x27;s first book, &quot;Nine Parts of Desire&quot; (1994), based on her experiences among Muslim women in the Middle East, was an international bestseller. It was translated into 17 languages. &quot;Foreign Correspondence&quot; (1997), which won the Nita Kibble Literary Award for women&#x27;s writing, was a memoir and travel adventure about a childhood enriched by penpals from around the world, and her adult quest to find them.

Her first novel, &quot;Year of Wonders&quot;, published in 2001, became an international bestseller. Set in 1666, the story depicts a young woman&#x27;s battle to save fellow villagers as well as her own soul when the bubonic plague suddenly strikes her small Derbyshire village of Eyam.

Her next novel, &quot;March&quot; (2005), was inspired by her fondness for Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women,&quot; which her mother had given her. To connect that memorable reading experience to her new status in 2002 as an American citizen, she researched the Civil War historical setting of &quot;Little Women&quot; and decided to create a chronicle of wartime service for the &quot;absent father&quot; of the March girls. Some aspects of this chronicle were informed by the life and philosophical writings of the Alcott family patriarch, Amos Bronson Alcott, whom she profiled under the title &quot;Orpheus at the Plough&quot;, in the 10 January 2005 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a month before &quot;March&quot; was published. The parallel novel received a mixed reaction from critics, but was nonetheless selected in December 2005 by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as one of the five best fiction works published that year, and in April 2006, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. She was eligible for the prize by virtue of her American citizenship, and was the first Australian to win the prize.

In her next novel, &quot;People of the Book&quot; (2008), Brooks explored a fictionalized history of the Sarajevo Haggadah. This novel was inspired by her reporting (for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;) of human interest stories emerging in the aftermath of the 1991–95 breakup of Yugoslavia. The novel won both the Australian Book of the Year Award and the Australian Literary Fiction Award in 2008.

Her 2011 novel &quot;Caleb&#x27;s Crossing&quot; is inspired by the life of Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk, a Wampanoag convert to Christianity who was the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College, in the seventeenth century.

Brooks, at the invitation of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, delivered the 2011 series of the prestigious Boyer Lectures. These have been published as &quot;The Idea of Home&quot;, and reveal her passionate humanist values.

&quot;The Secret Chord&quot; (2015) is a historical novel based on the life of the biblical King David in the Second Iron Age.

In 2016, Brooks visited Israel, as part of a project by the &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; organization, to write an article for a book on the Israeli occupation, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War. The book was edited by Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and was published under the title &quot;Kingdom of Olives and Ash: Writers Confront the Occupation&quot;, in June 2017.

&quot;Horse&quot; (2022) is a historical novel based upon the racing horse Lexington. It quickly became a New York Times Best Seller. It won the 2023 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Fiction.

== Recognition ==
*1996: Overseas Press Club Award for best coverage of the Gulf War.
*2006: Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for &quot;March&quot;
*2008: Australian Publishers Association&#x27;s Literary Fiction Book of the Year for &quot;People of the Book&quot;

Their specialty television networks are among the most widely distributed and frequently consulted television networks in Canada. &quot;TheWeatherNetwork.com&quot; is among Canada&#x27;s leading web services, and their mobile web property is ranked #1 in the weather category and the second largest mobile website in Canada.

TWN was launched on September 1, 1988 as WeatherNow by Lavalin Inc. and Landmark Communications, the owner of The Weather Channel and renamed to its present name on May 1, 1989. With ownership changes over the years, Pelmorex acquired TWC&#x27;s stake in 2015.

The network offers regional feeds for Alberta, Toronto, Atlantic Canada and British Columbia. It also operates counterpart brands including MétéoMédia; Canadian, Eltiempo Spain, Wetter Plus Germany, and Clima Latin America.

== History ==
The Weather Network was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on December 1, 1987 and began broadcasting on September 1, 1988 (six years after the U.S. Weather Channel) as WeatherNow, under the ownership of engineering firm Lavalin Inc. (now known as SNC-Lavalin) and Landmark Communications. The channel gained its present name on May 1, 1989. In the early years, TWN, and its sister channel, MétéoMédia, shared a single television feed via analogue transponder on one of the Anik satellites, with computer-generated local forecasts airing on one while the video feed of a live forecaster or commercials aired on the other. At first the video section was only available during drive times on weekdays and half of the day on weekends; at other times local forecast was looped. The two services began to run separately starting in 1994, while both were still based in Montreal. Local forecasts were generated using the same systems owned by The Weather Channel in the U.S. called WeatherStar. TWN began using its own system called PMX in 1996, which is still in use today. Pelmorex purchased The Weather Network from SNC-Lavalin in 1993, two years after the merger of SNC and Lavalin. The channel launched its website in 1996.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, The Weather Network broadcasts were divided into different programming blocks. One of the most notable was &quot;EarthWatch&quot;, which originally began as a five-minute news segment discussing environmental and weather-related issues. The show had expanded as a nighttime programming block in the mid-1990s, and the news segment later spun off as the current &quot;WeatherWatch&quot; segment. Other programming blocks included the &quot;Morning Report&quot;, focusing on Eastern Canada in the mornings; &quot;Sea to Sea&quot;, focusing on Western Canada in the &quot;workday&quot; hours; an unnamed afternoon block which would later be known as &quot;Across Canada&quot; (spun off from a segment seen on &quot;EarthWatch&quot;); and the &quot;Weekend Report&quot;, later known as &quot;This Weekend&quot;. (&quot;Morning Report&quot; was, coincidentally, the title of the GTA broadcast dated back to February 7, 1994; the runtime was 4 hours. When it was upgraded to a national broadcast; &quot;Good Morning Toronto&quot; was provided as a replacement, but runtime was reduced by half-hour.) Programming blocks were discontinued in 2002 for weekdays and 2004 on weekends, although &quot;This Weekend&quot; continued to air until 2007.

On May 2, 1998, The Weather Network started broadcasting nationally from a new studio facility in Mississauga, Ontario after relocating from Montreal. This led to the departure of several presenters, notably those who were on air during weekends. Several new presenters arrived at the time, while many of the Montreal presenters initially relocated, most departed from the channel over time, many of whom moved back to Montreal. To date, Chris St. Clair is the only presenter from Montreal remaining.
Late 2000 marked the beginning of a period of gradual, but significant changes with The Weather Network&#x27;s programming, starting with the launch of a seven-day and short term precipitation forecast during the Local Forecast along with the introduction of new weather icon that is used currently. In 2002, The Weather Network introduced &quot;Metacast Ultra&quot;, a weather presentation system that consisted of weather maps featuring more than 1,200 local communities, commuter routes and regional highways, animated weather icons, and higher resolution weather graphics. On March 29, 2004, The Weather Network introduced a new 14-day trend outlook as part of the local cable weather package. It provided a two-week look at how the weather would trend compared to normal temperature values and weather conditions for that time of year. In June 2004, The Weather Network took legal action against Star Choice (now Shaw Direct) after moving TWN on a new bundle without giving any notice to its subscribers. The channel&#x27;s management tried to prevent Star Choice from moving the channel as subscribers would have to pay an additional $7 to watch The Weather Network. In late 2004, TWN made improved local forecast coverage, providing more localized forecasts in up to 1,200 communities across Canada.

The Weather Network relocated its headquarters to Oakville, Ontario in November 2005. The channel&#x27;s GTA morning show made its debut at the brand new broadcast facility on November 29, 2005, while the network&#x27;s national programming started broadcasting from the new facility on December 2, 2005. The Weather Network has gradually introduced new local weather products including an hourly forecast for the next 12 hours in 2006, long term precipitation forecasts in 2008 and improved satellite and radar maps in 2009.

In 2009, The Weather Network was granted 9(1)(&quot;h&quot;) must-carry status by the CRTC, under the condition that Pelmorex develop a &quot;national aggregator and distributor&quot; of localized emergency alert messages.

In early 2013, The Weather Network launched regional feeds, currently for Alberta and the Maritime provinces. Each feed features its own regional forecasts, weather stories, and where available, traffic information was provided by Beat the Traffic.

On December 8, 2014, The Weather Network and CBC News began a content-sharing partnership, in which TWN produced national weather forecasts that would appear on CBC News Network and during &quot;The National&quot;, and The Weather Network would be able to syndicate CBC News content on its television and digital outlets.

In 2015, Pelmorex bought out The Weather Channel&#x27;s stake in the service.

== Programming ==

=== Studio/Live Programming ===
The Weather Network broadcasts in a news-wheel format, featuring various forecast or weather-related segments throughout the hour.

For some regions including the Greater Toronto Area, Alberta and the Maritime provinces, &quot;Regional forecasts&quot; are shown every half-hour, featuring forecasts and weather stories specifically for its respective region. For some areas, traffic reports are also presented during the morning and afternoon commute. For other regions &quot;WeatherWATCH&quot; provide a detailed analysis of the current weather across Canada, including the weather expected nationwide over the next three days. WeatherWATCH airs for three minutes just before the local/regional forecasts.

The remaining half-hour cycle features various weather stories from across the country and around the world. In addition, TWN airs a variety of smaller segments including:

* Force of Nature - (Featured every 10 minutes on the 3&#x27;s, a show-reel of significant weather making headlines around the world).
* Flu, Cold and Covid Reports
* Weather Watch
* Storm Centre
* Science Behind the Weather
* Regional
* Climate
* Beyond The forecast
* Local Forecast - Radar update and major cities&#x27; forecasts for seven days ahead.
* Storm-Hunters - Weekends at 7 and 10pm.
* Captured
* Share Your Weather
* Must See
* Weather and Your Health
* The Travellers Report - Today&#x27;s outlook for major cities in Canada, the United States and the Caribbean.

The Weather Network the news department won the first annual Adrienne Clarkson Diversity Award for network television. This award is given by the Radio and Television News Director&#x27;s Association (R-T-N-D-A) for the best news reports on a subject of cultural diversity. The Weather Network then won for its 2006 two-part news series on weather and black history. The Weather Network also won a World Medal from the NY Festivals International TV Broadcasting Awards for a 2007 story on a blind woman learning to sail who uses her other senses to determine changes in wind patterns and potential storms. It won the same award again in 2008 for a story on a man and his seeing-eye dog trying to adapt to a harsh New Brunswick winter.

== The Weather Network HD ==

The Weather Network HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of The Weather Network that launched on May 30, 2011. It is currently available on Cogeco, EastLink, Bell MTS, Rogers Cable, Telus Optik TV, and Shaw Cable. The HD simulcast for cable and IPTV providers currently do not offer local forecasts unlike the standard definition feed. On August 22, 2017, the HD feed debuted on Shaw Direct.

At first, the channel&#x27;s design featured a carousel consists of current temperatures, 18-hour and 3-day forecasts (including expected temperatures, conditions and precipitation possibility) for key cities within the viewer&#x27;s region. Throughout the local forecast segments, an additional L-shaped banner was introduced, with the top two-thirds of the ticker displays similar information (for two cities at a time instead of one), while the bottom of the ticker promotes upcoming segments in the programming cycle. At the start of 2014 spring programming cycle, &quot;14 day trends&quot; were introduced to the latter, whilst the former showcased information from 50 major Canadian cities. The L-shaped banner was expanded to be used at all times. Special weather statements are shown on a crawl that appears above the bottom of the ticker, when active.

In 2017, the HD feed underwent another change in on-screen design, now featuring DIN Next as the principal typeface. This typeface has been dominant in the SD feed since roughly the mid-2010s. The top two-thirds now features three &quot;boxes&quot;, with the first one showing the city as a header, and contains the current local time, date and weather conditions. The second one cycles through extra information on ceiling, pressure, humidity, apparent temperature, wind, gusts and visibility. The final &quot;box&quot; contains 18-hour forecasts for the city. The bottom of the ticker now alternates between national weather headlines and information of upcoming programming, which could be overridden at anytime by special weather statements on a bottom-up scrolling text format.

== Satellite services ==
In 2006, Bell Satellite TV and The Weather Network started an interactive version of The Weather Network, enabling viewers to set their city and view specific forecasts every time. These services are no longer available as of August 1, 2021.

== Web &amp; mobile services ==
In addition to its website, The Weather Network runs an e-mail and text messaging service called WeatherDirect, that sends weather forecasts via e-mail. There is also an e-mail service for pollen conditions and road conditions. The Weather Network also operates a Twitter and Facebook account, which include Severe Weather alerts and Weather News.

=== Mobile App ===
The Weather Network is currently available as an app for iPhone and Android smartphones.

=== Smart TV App ===
In November 2015, an app-only version of the TV channel was launched on Android TV (using Live Channels) and Apple TV. It has a similar news-wheel, albeit with some changes, and overlays the local forecast at the bottom dynamically using GPS. It also includes on-demand video and local maps.

== Criticism ==
The channel has been criticized for its excessive use of advertising through commercials and forecasts and some weather segments (e.g., hot spots, picnic/barbecue report, etc.) – which has led to less time for detailed forecasts and more time spent on advertising. The same problem also occurs with U.S.-based The Weather Channel. In the past, there was little to no advertising. Currently, local forecasts are sponsored using static logos during and after forecasts.

The channel has also been criticized for putting more coverage over the weather in Southern Ontario than the rest of Canada during its national segments. The 2008 launch of local programming for the Greater Toronto Area had also further limited updated forecasts throughout the rest of Canada.

<doc id="1179451" wikidata="Q810255" url="?curid=1179451" title="Change of basis">
<text>In mathematics, an ordered basis of a vector space of finite dimension allows representing uniquely any element of the vector space by a coordinate vector, which is a sequence of scalars called coordinates. If two different bases are considered, the coordinate vector that represents a vector on one basis is, in general, different from the coordinate vector that represents on the other basis. A change of basis consists of converting every assertion expressed in terms of coordinates relative to one basis into an assertion expressed in terms of coordinates relative to the other basis.

Such a conversion results from the &quot;change-of-basis formula&quot; which expresses the coordinates relative to one basis in terms of coordinates relative to the other basis. Using matrices, this formula can be written
:formula_1
where &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; refer respectively to the initially defined basis and the other basis, formula_2 and formula_3 are the column vectors of the coordinates of the same vector on the two bases. formula_4 is the change-of-basis matrix (also called transition matrix), which is the matrix whose columns are the coordinates of the new basis vectors on the old basis.

A change of basis is sometimes called a &quot;change of coordinates&quot;, although it excludes many coordinate transformations.
For applications in physics and specially in mechanics, a change of basis often involves the transformation of an orthonormal basis, understood as a rotation in physical space, thus excluding translations.
This article deals mainly with finite-dimensional vector spaces. However, many of the principles are also valid for infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

==Change of basis formula==
Let formula_5 be a basis of a finite-dimensional vector space over a field .

For , one can define a vector by its coordinates formula_6 over formula_7
:formula_8

Let
:formula_9
be the matrix whose th column is formed by the coordinates of . (Here and in what follows, the index refers always to the rows of and the formula_10 while the index refers always to the columns of and the formula_11 such a convention is useful for avoiding errors in explicit computations.)

Setting formula_12 one has that formula_13 is a basis of if and only if the matrix is invertible, or equivalently if it has a nonzero determinant. In this case, is said to be the &quot;change-of-basis matrix&quot; from the basis formula_14 to the basis formula_15

Given a vector formula_16 let formula_17 be the coordinates of formula_18 over formula_19 and formula_20 its coordinates over formula_21 that is 
:formula_22
(One could take the same summation index for the two sums, but choosing systematically the indexes for the old basis and for the new one makes clearer the formulas that follows, and helps avoiding errors in proofs and explicit computations.)

The &quot;change-of-basis formula&quot; expresses the coordinates over the old basis in terms of the coordinates over the new basis. With above notation, it is
:formula_23

In terms of matrices, the change of basis formula is
:formula_24
where formula_25 and formula_26 are the column vectors of the coordinates of over formula_14 and formula_28 respectively.

&quot;Proof:&quot; Using the above definition of the change-of basis matrix, one has
:formula_29

As formula_30 the change-of-basis formula results from the uniqueness of the decomposition of a vector over a basis.

== Example ==

Consider the Euclidean vector space formula_31 and a basis consisting of the vectors formula_32 and formula_33 If one rotates them by an angle of , one has a &quot;new basis&quot; formed by formula_34 and formula_35

So, the change-of-basis matrix is
formula_36

The change-of-basis formula asserts that, if formula_37 are the new coordinates of a vector formula_38 then one has
:formula_39

That is, 
:formula_40
This may be verified by writing
:formula_41

==In terms of linear maps==
Normally, a matrix represents a linear map, and the product of a matrix and a column vector represents the function application of the corresponding linear map to the vector whose coordinates form the column vector. The change-of-basis formula is a specific case of this general principle, although this is not immediately clear from its definition and proof.

When one says that a matrix &quot;represents&quot; a linear map, one refers implicitly to bases of implied vector spaces, and to the fact that the choice of a basis induces an isomorphism between a vector space and , where is the field of scalars. When only one basis is considered for each vector space, it is worth to leave this isomorphism implicit, and to work up to an isomorphism. As several bases of the same vector space are considered here, a more accurate wording is required.

Let be a field, the set formula_42 of the -tuples is a -vector space whose addition and scalar multiplication are defined component-wise. Its standard basis is the basis that has as its th element the tuple with all components equal to except the th that is .

A basis formula_43 of a -vector space defines a linear isomorphism formula_44 by 
:formula_45
Conversely, such a linear isomorphism defines a basis, which is the image by formula_46 of the standard basis of formula_47

Let formula_5 be the &quot;old basis&quot; of a change of basis, and formula_49 the associated isomorphism. Given a change-of basis matrix , one could consider it the matrix of an endomorphism formula_50 of formula_47 Finally, define
:formula_52 
(where formula_53 denotes function composition), and
:formula_54
A straightforward verification shows that this definition of formula_55 is the same as that of the preceding section.

Now, by composing the equation formula_52 with formula_57 on the left and formula_58 on the right, one gets 
:formula_59
It follows that, for formula_60 one has 
:formula_61
which is the change-of-basis formula expressed in terms of linear maps instead of coordinates.

==Function defined on a vector space==

A function that has a vector space as its domain is commonly specified as a multivariate function whose variables are the coordinates on some basis of the vector on which the function is applied.

When the basis is changed, the expression of the function is changed. This change can be computed by substituting the &quot;old&quot; coordinates for their expressions in terms of the &quot;new&quot; coordinates. More precisely, if is the expression of the function in terms of the old coordinates, and if is the change-of-base formula, then is the expression of the same function in terms of the new coordinates.

The fact that the change-of-basis formula expresses the old coordinates in terms of the new one may seem unnatural, but appears as useful, as no matrix inversion is needed here.

As the change-of-basis formula involves only linear functions, many function properties are kept by a change of basis. This allows defining these properties as properties of functions of a variable vector that are not related to any specific basis. So, a function whose domain is a vector space or a subset of it is 
* a linear function,
* a polynomial function,
* a continuous function,
* a differentiable function,
* a smooth function,
* an analytic function,
if the multivariate function that represents it on some basis—and thus on every basis—has the same property.

This is specially useful in the theory of manifolds, as this allows extending the concepts of continuous, differentiable, smooth and analytic functions to functions that are defined on a manifold.

== Linear maps ==
Consider a linear map from a vector space of dimension to a vector space of dimension . It is represented on &quot;old&quot; bases of and by a matrix . A change of bases is defined by an change-of-basis matrix for , and an change-of-basis matrix for .

On the &quot;new&quot; bases, the matrix of is 
:formula_62
This is a straightforward consequence of the change-of-basis formula.

== Endomorphisms ==
Endomorphisms are linear maps from a vector space to itself. For a change of basis, the formula of the preceding section applies, with the same change-of-basis matrix on both sides of the formula. That is, if is the square matrix of an endomorphism of over an &quot;old&quot; basis, and is a change-of-basis matrix, then the matrix of the endomorphism on the &quot;new&quot; basis is
:formula_63

As every invertible matrix can be used as a change-of-basis matrix, this implies that two matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same endomorphism on two different bases.

== Bilinear forms ==
A &quot;bilinear form&quot; on a vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field is a function which is linear in both arguments. That is, is bilinear if the maps
formula_64
and formula_65
are linear for every fixed formula_66

The matrix of a bilinear form on a basis formula_67 (the &quot;old&quot; basis in what follows) is the matrix whose entry of the th row and th column is formula_68. It follows that if and are the column vectors of the coordinates of two vectors and , one has
:formula_69
where formula_70 denotes the transpose of the matrix .

If is a change of basis matrix, then a straightforward computation shows that the matrix of the bilinear form on the new basis is
:formula_71

A symmetric bilinear form is a bilinear form such that formula_72 for every and in . It follows that the matrix of on any basis is symmetric. This implies that the property of being a symmetric matrix must be kept by the above change-of-base formula. One can also check this by noting that the transpose of a matrix product is the product of the transposes computed in the reverse order. In particular,
:formula_73
and the two members of this equation equal formula_74 if the matrix is symmetric.

If the characteristic of the ground field is not two, then for every symmetric bilinear form there is a basis for which the matrix is diagonal. Moreover, the resulting nonzero entries on the diagonal are defined up to the multiplication by a square. So, if the ground field is the field formula_75 of the real numbers, these nonzero entries can be chosen to be either or . Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia is a theorem that asserts that the numbers of and of depends only on the bilinear form, and not of the change of basis.

Symmetric bilinear forms over the reals are often encountered in geometry and physics, typically in the study of quadrics and of the inertia of a rigid body. In these cases, orthonormal bases are specially useful; this means that one generally prefer to restrict changes of basis to those that have an orthogonal change-of-base matrix, that is, a matrix such that formula_76 Such matrices have the fundamental property that the change-of-base formula is the same for a symmetric bilinear form and the endomorphism that is represented by the same symmetric matrix. The Spectral theorem asserts that, given such a symmetric matrix, there is an orthogonal change of basis such that the resulting matrix (of both the bilinear form and the endomorphism) is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the initial matrix on the diagonal. It follows that, over the reals, if the matrix of an endomorphism is symmetric, then it is diagonalizable.

<text>Shankaracharya (, , &quot;Shankara-&quot;acharya&quot;&quot;) is a religious title used by the heads of amnaya monasteries called mathas in the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism. The title derives from Adi Shankara; teachers from the successive line of teachers retrospectively dated back to him are known as Shankaracharyas.

== Etymology ==
The word Shankaracharya is composed of two parts, Shankara and Acharya. Acharya is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;teacher&quot;, so Shankaracharya means &quot;teacher of the way of Shankara&quot;.
== Establishment of the tradition ==
According to a tradition developed in the 16th century, Adi Shankara set up four monasteries known as Mathas or Peethams, in the North, South, East and West of India, to be held by realised men who would be known as Shankaracharyas. They would take on the role of teacher and could be consulted by anyone with sincere queries of a spiritual nature. Another monastery Kanchi Kamkoti Peeth in south India also derives its establishment and tradition to Adi Shankara, however its heads are called &quot;Acharya&quot; or &quot;Jagadguru&quot; instead of &quot;Shankaracharya&quot;.

The table below gives an overview of the four main Shankaracharya Amnaya Mathas reputedly founded by Adi Shankara, and their details.

<text>Vache Artashesi Hovsepyan (17 September 19251 December 1978) was an Armenian duduk player and renowned popular artist.

He graduated from the in 1951. He had started performing as a popular musician on Yerevan radio in 1945 in Armenian popular and folk music. He has composed music for songs like &quot;Estonakan Erg&quot; (lyrics by Vahan Terian), &quot;Iriknazhamin&quot; (lyrics by Silva Kaputikyan) and &quot;Ereknuk&quot; (lyrics by Paruyr Sevak) and others. He also toured in live performances in Armenia, the Soviet Union and worldwide.

With Andranik Askarian, he performed the duduk parts on &quot;The Feeling Begins&quot;, the opening track of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the soundtrack album from Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. The duduk recording is actually an excerpt from a song titled &quot;The Wind Subsides&quot;, originally recorded for a collection of Armenian music released by Radio France&#x27;s Ocora label.

<text>Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse is a 1960s children&#x27;s cartoon television show that was produced by Trans-Artists Productions and syndicated by Tele Features Inc. The characters were originated and created by authors Bob Kane and Gerald J. Rappoport as a parody of Kane&#x27;s earlier creations, Batman and Robin. In many ways, &quot;Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse&quot; presages the camp aspects of the later &quot;Batman&quot; live-action series, which William Dozier and Howie Horwitz produced as a villain-driven action-comedy lampoon. Storyboard design was by Kane&#x27;s assistant/ghost Sheldon Moldoff.

==Plot==
In the animated series, the pair are anthropomorphic animal superheroes without known secret identities (the green-eyed caped crimefighter and his squeaky-voiced companion are usually addressed as simply &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Minute&quot;) who live in the Cat Cave. When summoned via the Cat Signal over their television set, Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse race to the scene of the crime in their sleekly feline red Cat Mobile which can convert into both the extendable-winged Cat Plane and submersible Cat Boat and thwart the criminal plots of various villains who threaten Empire City. The episodes contained storylines and screenplays and characters written by authors Gerald J. Rappoport and drawings and characters by Bob Kane.

Though they fought many miscreants, the duo&#x27;s recurring arch-enemy was Chauncey &quot;Flat-Face&quot; Frog who appeared in nearly every episode.

The five-minute length of the cartoons made the series suitable for use as interstitials or airtime fillers, especially to accommodate a movie or show that ended at an unusually early time, as well as animated content for local children&#x27;s shows. The first episode was broadcast on Wednesday September 14, 1960 as part of &quot;The Tommy Seven Show&quot; by means of channel 7, of which the call letters were WABC-TV of New York City.

==Characters==
===Heroes===
* Courageous Cat – The protector of Empire City. Whenever fighting bad guys, Courageous Cat would use his all-purpose Cat Gun or a vast variety of different deus ex machina &quot;trick guns&quot; he pulls out of his cape that (like the Green Arrow&#x27;s trick arrows) fire whatever the situation requires like a rope, some water, a parachute, cages, boxing gloves, lightning-like magnetic rays, or even more bizarre ammunition, and even the occasional actual bullet. In case of emergency, Courageous also has extra pre-James Bond secret gadgets hidden in his belt buckle and the star emblem on his chest.
* Minute Mouse – Courageous Cat&#x27;s rodent sidekick.

===Supporting characters===
* The Chief – A canine chief of police who calls in the &quot;furry foes of felony&quot; via the Cat Signal.
* Marilyn Mouse – Minute Mouse&#x27;s movie star girlfriend.

* Periscope Pete – A living, breathing periscope with a bush for a body.

===Villains===
* Chauncey &quot;Flat-Face&quot; Frog – Chauncey is a chortling, cigar-smoking, derby-hatted criminal mastermind whose voice was based on Edward G. Robinson.
** Harry Gorilla – Chauncey &quot;Flat-Face&quot; Frog&#x27;s hulking, half-witted henchman.
* Professor Shaggy Dog – A mad scientist with an Albert Einstein-like mop of white hair who is tall, thin, and bewhiskered in some episodes and short and bespectacled in others.
* Big Shot and Little Shot – A burly bulldog (who talks like James Cagney in some episodes) and his short sidekick who are generic gruff gangsters that are Chauncey &quot;Flat-Face&quot; Frog&#x27;s rivals in crime.
* The Black Cat – A sinister thief. He is a &quot;cat burglar&quot; who is a caricature of Cary Grant.
* Rodney Rodent – A French-accented rat artist gone bad.
* Shoo Shoo Fly – A tiny insect whose small size belies its enormous appetite, its name is a reference to shoofly pie and the tsetse fly.

* Comrade and Commissar – Russian-accented, trench coat-clad foreign dog spies whom Courageous and Minute were never able to apprehend due to their &quot;diplomatic immunity&quot; – true Cold War villains.
* The Unmentionables and The Unthinkables – Rival gangs headed by Chauncey &quot;Flat-Face&quot; Frog and Big Shot. Their names are a parody of &quot;The Untouchables.&quot;
* Outrageous Cat – Courageous Cat&#x27;s Wild West outlaw-style cousin who talks like Yosemite Sam.
* Screwy Squirrel – A rarely seen criminal who usually appeared as part of a group.
* Tony and Angel – A pair of crooks who steal an invisibility formula so that they can commit crimes without being seen.

* Dallas McKennon – Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse

==Episodes==
==Home video releases==
A&amp;E Home Video (distributed by New Video) released all 130 five-minute-long episodes on DVD in Region 1 on October 29, 2002.

The memorable theme music by Johnny Holiday features a walking bass line and is fashioned after the theme for &quot;Peter Gunn.&quot; It has most notably been performed in concert by the New York Dolls and their version of the &quot;Courageous Cat Theme&quot; featured on their album &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll&quot; (1994). The theme was also featured in &quot;Thousand Dollar Bill&quot;, a 1959 episode of the Mike Connors detective series &quot;Tightrope!&quot;. It also appears in &quot;The Jackson Greene Story&quot;, a 1959 episode of &quot;The Millionaire (TV series)&quot;. It was also sampled on Jay-Z&#x27;s first recording &quot;HP Gets Busy&quot; by High Potent (1986), LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot; (1987), and Soul Coughing&#x27;s &quot;Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago&quot; (1994).

==Merchandise==
In 1960, Simon Says Records released a 12&quot; vinyl record entitled &quot;COURAGEOUS CAT in the story of “Around the World in a Daze”&quot; featuring Dal McKennon and Johhny Holiday performing all the voices. It runs for 24 minutes and is available to listen to on Youtube.

Other items of merchandise from the early 1960s included a Courageous Cat Sliding Squares Puzzle, a Super Slate, a Collegeville Courageous Cat halloween costume including mask, at least two coloring books, and matchbooks.

==Later appearances==
Reruns of &quot;Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse&quot; were shown on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Weinerville&quot; in the 1990s along with reruns of &quot;Batfink&quot; and both segments of &quot;The Alvin Show.&quot;

In Germany and Austria the show was called &quot;Mirakulus und Supermaus&quot;, and was broadcast as part of the German children&#x27;s television show &quot;Bim Bam Bino (1988-98)&quot; on Tele 5. Some episodes were released on VHS and DVD.

<text>Arthur Herbert Lindsay Richardson VC (23 September 1872 – 15 December 1932) was an England-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Southport, Lancashire, in 1872, Richardson emigrated to Canada in 1891. After a period as a rancher, he joined the North-West Mounted Police in 1894. He was stationed in Prince Albert in 1899. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, in 1900 he joined the newly raised Strathcona&#x27;s Horse.

Richardson was 27 years old and a sergeant when the deed, for which he was awarded the VC, took place. The VC was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 14 September 1900, four months before the death of Queen Victoria. The medal was presented to him by King Edward VII at the first presentation of VCs after the King ascended the throne. Richardson was the third of three VCs presented with their medals on 12 March 1901 at St James&#x27; Palace.

The commander of his unit, Lieutenant Agar Adamson, reported:
Richardson was the first member of a Canadian unit awarded the Victoria Cross.

He re-joined the NWMP in 1902 and served until ill health forced him to retire in 1907. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1916, Richardson returned to Liverpool and died there in 1932.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. His gravestone can be seen at the Liverpool Cathedral St. James Gardens.

<doc id="1179476" wikidata="Q4648203" url="?curid=1179476" title="A. N. Wilson">
<text>Andrew Norman Wilson (born 27 October 1950) is an English writer and newspaper columnist known for his critical biographies, novels and works of popular history. He is an occasional columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and a former columnist for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He has been an occasional contributor to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born on 27 October 1950 in Stone in Staffordshire. His father became the managing director of Wedgwood, the pottery company. 

He was first educated at the independent Catholic day school, St Dominic&#x27;s Priory School, Stone before moving to Hillstone School (subsequently incorporated into Malvern College) in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, and then at Rugby School from the age of 13, where he read Mao and Marx in his spare time. While at Rugby, he wrote an article for the school magazine arguing that public schools should be abolished. The national press became interested in the story, with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; headlining its account &quot;Red rebel in Tom Brown&#x27;s school&quot;. &quot;Reporters arrived at the school gates, wanting to interview me, but my housemaster, wisely, would not let me talk to them&quot;, Wilson told Hunter Davies in 1993.

Wilson went to New College, Oxford, graduating in 1972. He had originally entered St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford, a Church of England seminary, with the intention of being ordained as a priest, but left the college after only one year of study, and five years after graduation published the novel &quot;Unguarded Hours&quot; (1978) based upon his experiences at the seminary and his perception of its homoerotic atmosphere.

Wilson taught English at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood, for two years and then spent seven years as a lecturer in medieval literature at St Hugh&#x27;s College and New College, Oxford.

==Publications==
A prolific journalist and author of nonfiction, Wilson has also written over 20 works of fiction, for which he has won the Somerset Maugham Prize and the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. His novels also include such historical works as &quot;The Potter’s Hand&quot; (a study of the family life of Josiah Wedgwood), &quot;Resolution&quot;, a fictional account of Captain James Cook&#x27;s second voyage, and &quot;Scandal&quot;, about the Profumo affair. His 2007 novel &quot;Winnie and Wolf&quot;, about the relationship between Adolf Hitler and Richard Wagner&#x27;s English daughter-in-law Winifred, was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Novels set in the present include &quot;The Vicar of Sorrows&quot; (1993), about a clergyman who has lost his faith dealing with the death of his mother, and &quot;Dream Children&quot; (1998), about paedophilia.

In the early 1990s, in the wake of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie and the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, Wilson published a pamphlet, &quot;Against Religion&quot;, in the Chatto &amp; Windus CounterBlasts series. He wrote biographies of Jesus and St Paul as well as a history of atheism in the 19th century titled &quot;God&#x27;s Funeral&quot;, describing its growth as due to influences ranging from David Hume to Sigmund Freud. These and many other of his books, such as those on Leo Tolstoy (Whitbread Award for best biography of 1988), C. S. Lewis and Hilaire Belloc, are simultaneously sympathetic to religious belief and critical of it.

In August 2006, Wilson&#x27;s biography of Sir John Betjeman was published. It was then discovered that he had been the victim of a hoax perpetrated by Betjeman&#x27;s disgruntled biographer Bevis Hillier. Wilson had included in the book a letter (to Anglo-Irish writer Honor Tracy), purportedly by Betjeman, detailing a previously unknown love affair. Wilson acknowledged the letter to be a fiction when it was pointed out that it contained an acrostic spelling out an insulting message to him: &quot;AN Wilson is a shit&quot;.

In 2001, Wilson published &quot;Dante in Love&quot;, a study of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri as an artist and philosopher, also portraying medieval Florence in depth to help readers understand the literary and cultural background of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;.

In addition to his biographies, Wilson has written four books covering entire eras, &quot;The Victorians&quot; (2002), &quot;After the Victorians&quot; (2005), &quot;Our Times&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Elizabethans&quot; (2011).

===Critiques of Wilson&#x27;s work===

Lynn Barber of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;Wilson&#x27;s forte is the character and he brilliantly conveys Betjeman&#x27;s odd mixture of introspection and sociability, gaiety and melancholia, exhibition and self-disgust&quot;.

In &quot;The Times&quot; (London), James Marriott called Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Resolution&quot; &quot;a work of genius&quot;.

Kathryn Hughes wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of Wilson&#x27;s biography of Queen Victoria, &quot;Victoria: A Life&quot;, &quot;Subtle, thoughtful ... a shimmering and rather wonderful biography.&quot; Daisy Goodwin in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; review wrote: &quot;This won&#x27;t be the last biography of Victoria but it is certainly the most interesting and original in a long time.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was criticised by the historian Richard J. Evans in a review in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; for factual inaccuracies and lack of original research and analysis, as well as personal biases. In his review of &quot;The Laird of Abbotsford&quot; for &quot;Cencrastus&quot;, David McKie observed that &quot;Concluding with Chesterton that the superficial impression of the world is by far the deepest, Wilson underpins his notions of Scott with the same paradoxical hope.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s biography &quot;Charles Darwin, Victorian Mythmaker&quot; (2017), was criticised by John van Wyhe in &quot;New Scientist&quot; for confusing Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection with Lamarckism at one point, as well as other scientific, historical and editorial errors. Kathryn Hughes in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it a &quot;cheap attempt to ruffle feathers&quot;, with a dubious grasp of science and attempted character assassination. In the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Adrian Woolfson wrote that &quot;while for the greater part a lucid, elegantly written and thought-provoking social and intellectual history&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s &quot;speculations on evolutionary theory&quot; produce a book that is &quot;fatally flawed, mischievous, and ultimately misleading&quot;. Steve Jones, an emeritus professor of genetics of University College London, commented in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;: &quot;In the classic mould of the contrarian, he despises anything said by mainstream biology in favour of marginal and sometimes preposterous theories.&quot; The geneticist and former editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, Adam Rutherford, called the book &quot;deranged&quot; and said Wilson &quot;would fail GCSE biology catastrophically.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Wilson married the Shakespearean scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones in 1971, before his graduation. They had two daughters, Emily Wilson (born 1971) and Beatrice &quot;Bee&quot; Wilson (born 1974), and divorced in 1990. he was married to the art historian Ruth Guilding, with whom he has a third daughter, the painter Georgina &quot;Georg&quot; Wilson.

<text>Air Vice Marshal Francis Hubert (Frank) McNamara, (4 April 1894 – 2 November 1961) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth forces. Serving with the Australian Flying Corps, he was honoured for his actions on 20 March 1917, when he rescued a fellow pilot who had been forced down behind enemy lines. McNamara was the first Australian aviator—and the only one in World War I—to receive the Victoria Cross. He later became a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

Born and educated in Victoria, McNamara was a teacher when he joined the militia prior to World War I. In 1915, he was selected for pilot training at Central Flying School, Point Cook, and transferred to the Australian Flying Corps the following year. He was based in the Middle Eastern Theatre with No. 1 Squadron when he earned the Victoria Cross. In 1921, McNamara enlisted as a flying officer in the newly formed RAAF, rising to the rank of air vice marshal by 1942. He held senior posts in England and Aden during World War II. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, McNamara continued to live in Britain until his death from heart failure in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in Rushworth, Victoria, McNamara was the first of eight children to William Francis McNamara, a State Lands Department officer, and his wife Rosanna. He began his schooling in Rushworth, and completed his secondary education at Shepparton Agricultural High School, which he had entered via a scholarship. The family moved to Melbourne in 1910.

McNamara joined the school cadets in 1911, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 49th Battalion (Brighton Rifles), a militia unit, in July 1913. He became a teacher after graduating from Melbourne Teachers&#x27; Training College in 1914, and taught at various schools in Victoria. He also enrolled in the University of Melbourne, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.

==World War I==

===Militia to Australian Flying Corps===

As a militia officer, McNamara was mobilised for service in Australia when war was declared in August 1914. After serving briefly at bases in Queenscliff and Point Nepean, Victoria, McNamara passed through Officers Training School at Broadmeadows in December. He began instructing at the Australian Imperial Force Training Depot, Broadmeadows, in February 1915. Promoted to lieutenant in July, he immediately volunteered for a military aeronautics course at Central Flying School, Point Cook.

Selected for flying training at Point Cook in August 1915, McNamara made his first solo flight in a Bristol Boxkite on 18 September, and graduated as a pilot in October. On 6 January 1916, he was assigned as adjutant to No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps (also known until 1918 as No. 67 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps). In March, McNamara departed Melbourne for Egypt aboard HMAT &quot;Orsova&quot;, arriving in Suez the following month. He was seconded to No. 42 Squadron RFC in May to attend the Central Flying School at Upavon, England; his secondment to the RFC was gazetted on 5 July 1916.

Completing his course at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with orchitis (an inflammation of the testes). Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a flying instructor with No. 22 Squadron RFC, before returning to No. 1 Squadron. McNamara flew with C Flight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams. On his first sortie, a reconnaissance mission over Sinai, McNamara was unaware that his plane had been hit by anti-aircraft fire; he returned to base with his engine&#x27;s oil supply almost exhausted. Flying B.E.2s and Martinsydes, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.

===Victoria Cross===

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying a Martinsyde, was one of four No. 1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway junction near Gaza. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially modified 4.5-inch howitzer shells. McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with shrapnel, an effect he likened to being &quot;hit with a sledgehammer&quot;. Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain Douglas Rutherford, on the ground beside his crashlanded B.E.2. Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara saw that a company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford&#x27;s position. Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford to try to rescue him.
As there was no spare cockpit in the single-seat Martinsyde, the downed pilot jumped onto McNamara&#x27;s wing and held the struts. McNamara crashed while attempting to take off because of the effects of his leg wound and Rutherford&#x27;s weight overbalancing the aircraft. The two men, who had escaped further injury in the accident, set fire to the Martinsyde and dashed back to Rutherford&#x27;s B.E.2. Rutherford repaired the engine while McNamara used his revolver against the attacking cavalry, who had opened fire on them. Two other No. 1 Squadron pilots overhead, Lieutenant (later Air Marshal Sir) Roy &quot;Peter&quot; Drummond and Lieutenant Alfred Ellis, also began strafing the enemy troops. McNamara managed to start the B.E.2&#x27;s engine and take off, with Rutherford in the observer&#x27;s cockpit. In severe pain and close to blacking out from loss of blood, McNamara flew the damaged aircraft back to base at El Arish.

Having effected what was described in the Australian official history of the war as &quot;a brilliant escape in the very nick of time and under hot fire&quot;, McNamara &quot;could only emit exhausted expletives&quot; before he lost consciousness shortly after landing. Evacuated to hospital, he almost died following an allergic reaction to a routine tetanus injection. McNamara had to be given artificial respiration and stimulants to keep him alive, but recovered quickly. A contemporary news report declared that he was &quot;soon sitting up, eating chicken and drinking champagne&quot;. On 26 March, McNamara was recommended for the Victoria Cross by Brigadier General Geoffrey Salmond, General Officer Commanding Middle East Brigade, RFC. Drummond, Ellis, and Rutherford all wrote statements on 3–4 April attesting to their comrade&#x27;s actions, Rutherford declaring that &quot;the risk of Lieut. MacNamara being killed or captured was so great that even had he not been wounded he would have been justified in not attempting my rescue—the fact of his already being wounded makes his action one of outstanding gallantry—his determination and resource and utter disregard of danger throughout the operation was worthy of the highest praise&quot;. The first and only VC awarded to an Australian airman in World War I, McNamara&#x27;s decoration was promulgated in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 8 June 1917:


Promoted to captain on 10 April 1917, McNamara became a flight commander in No. 4 Squadron AFC (also known until 1918 as No. 71 Squadron RFC), but was unable to continue flying due to the leg wound he suffered on 20 March. He was invalided back to Australia in August aboard HT &quot;Boorara&quot;, and given a hero&#x27;s welcome on arrival in Melbourne. Found to be medically unfit for active service, McNamara was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 31 January 1918. Panic caused by the intrusion into Australian waters of the German raider resulted in him being recalled to the AFC and put in charge of an aerial reconnaissance unit based in South Gippsland, Victoria, flying a Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2B and later a Maurice Farman Shorthorn. In September 1918, he was posted as a flying instructor to Point Cook, where he saw out the remainder of the war.

==Between the wars==
Following the disbandment of the AFC, McNamara transferred to the Australian Air Corps (AAC) in April 1920. He was not offered an appointment in the AAC initially, and secured one only after Captain Roy King protested the situation by giving up his own place in the new service in favour of McNamara, whom he described as &quot;this very good and gallant officer&quot;. McNamara was invested with his Victoria Cross by the Prince of Wales at Government House, Melbourne, on 26 May. He enlisted in the newly established Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1921. Ranked flying officer (honorary flight lieutenant), he was one of the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force&#x27;s strength at its formation that March. Posted to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne as Staff Officer Operations and Intelligence, McNamara was given command of No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) at Point Cook in July 1922. He was promoted squadron leader in March 1924 and the following month married Hélène Bluntschli, a Belgian national he had met in Cairo during the war, at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral; his best man was fellow officer Frank Lukis.

McNamara travelled to England in 1925 for two years exchange with the Royal Air Force, serving at No. 5 Flying Training School, RAF Sealand, and the Directorate of Training at the Air Ministry, London. Returning to Australia in November 1927, he was appointed Second-in-Command No. 1 FTS. In 1928, McNamara resumed his studies at the University of Melbourne, having earlier failed to pass the necessary exams to enter the RAF Staff College, Andover. A part-time student at the university, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations (second-class honours) in 1933. McNamara became Commanding Officer No. 1 FTS in October 1930, and was promoted to wing commander one year later. He was placed in charge of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, including No. 1 Aircraft Depot, in February 1933. McNamara was raised to group captain in 1936, and attended the Imperial Defence College, London, the following year. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honours.
==World War II==
When World War II broke out in September 1939, McNamara was serving as Air Liaison Officer at Australia House in London, a position he had held since January 1938. Shortly before being promoted air commodore in December, he advocated establishing a reception base to act as a headquarters for the RAAF in England and &quot;generally to watch the interests of Australian personnel&quot; who were stationed there. By November 1940 he had reversed his position, in favour of an Air Ministry proposal to process personnel of all nationalities in one RAF base camp. In the event, RAAF Overseas Headquarters was formed on 1 December 1941; Air Marshal Richard Williams was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) and McNamara Deputy AOC. McNamara became acting air vice marshal and acting AOC of RAAF Overseas Headquarters when Williams returned to Australia in January 1942 for what was expected to be a temporary visit; Williams was subsequently posted to Washington, D.C. and McNamara retained command of the headquarters until the end of the year.

McNamara was appointed AOC British Forces Aden in late 1942, and arrived to take up the posting on 9 January 1943. Described in the official history of Australia in the war as a &quot;backwater&quot;, British Forces Aden&#x27;s main functions were conducting anti-submarine patrols and escorting convoys. McNamara flew on these missions whenever he could, generally as an observer, but enemy contact was rare. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1945 New Year Honours, and returned to London in March. That month McNamara was deeply affected by the loss of his close friend Peter Drummond, who had helped keep attacking cavalry at bay during his Victoria Cross action in 1917. Drummond&#x27;s Consolidated B-24 Liberator disappeared near the Azores &quot;en route&quot; to Canada and all aboard were presumed killed; McNamara had to break the news to his widow, Isabel. McNamara&#x27;s health had also suffered from exposure to the desert dust in Aden, and he was unable to take up his next position as the RAAF&#x27;s representative at the Ministry of Defence until September. His entire war was spent outside Australia.

==Retirement and legacy==

McNamara was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with several other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, officially to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. His role overseas had in any case become redundant. He was discharged from the Air Force on 11 July. In May 1946, the British government offered McNamara the position of Senior Education Control Officer in Westphalia, Germany, under the auspices of the Allied Control Commission. He later became Deputy Director of Education for the British Zone of Occupation. McNamara continued to live in England after completing his work with the Commission in October 1947, and served on the National Coal Board in London from 1947 to 1959. He died of hypertensive heart failure on 2 November 1961, aged 67, after suffering a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire. Survived by his wife and two children, he was buried at St Joseph&#x27;s Priory, Austin Wood, Gerrards Cross, after a large funeral.

Embittered by his dismissal from the RAAF and the meagre severance he received from the Australian Government, McNamara insisted that his Victoria Cross not be returned to Australia after his death; his family donated it to the RAF Museum, London. A fellow No. 1 Squadron pilot, Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) Adrian Cole, described McNamara as &quot;quiet, scholarly, loyal and beloved by all ... the last Officer for whom that high honour would have been predicted&quot;. He was one of the few VC recipients to attain senior rank in the armed services, though RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered his appointments largely &quot;routine&quot; and that his one great deed led to &quot;a degree of fame that he perhaps found burdensome&quot;. Biographer Chris Coulthard-Clark summed up McNamara&#x27;s &quot;dilemma&quot; as that of &quot;an essentially ordinary man&quot; thrust into the limelight by one &quot;truly amazing episode&quot;. His name is borne by Frank McNamara Park in Shepparton, Victoria, and the Frank McNamara VC Club at Oakey Army Aviation Centre, Queensland.

<text>MétéoMédia is a Canadian French-language weather information specialty channel and web site owned by Pelmorex. MétéoMédia primarily serves viewers in Quebec, although some cable TV systems in Ontario and New Brunswick carry the channel as well. It is available nationwide via satellite. MétéoMédia went on the air along with the bilingual specialty service&#x27;s English-language component, The Weather Network, for the first time on September 1, 1988; both MétéoMédia and The Weather Network broadcast separate 24-hour-a-day feeds.
== Ownership ==

Both MétéoMedia and the Weather Network are owned by Pelmorex. The two originally shared an analogue transponder on one of the Anik satellites, with computer-generated local forecasts airing on one while the video feed of a live forecaster or TV commercials aired on the other. They swapped these two roles every five minutes.

On January 3, 2008, it was reported that Landmark Communications, part-owner of MétéoMédia, may be for sale. In July 2008, the Weather Channel was sold to NBCUniversal and Bain Capital; the sale included Landmark&#x27;s stakes in MétéoMedia and the Weather Network. Comcast, the parent of NBCUniversal, subsequently sold this minority interest to Pelmorex in 2015.

== Shows ==
MétéoMedia follows a schedule which repeats itself each hour, based on the current season. The spring/summer programming schedule often starts on the first Monday of April. It switches to the winter schedule on the first Monday of December. The following segments are commonly seen on the network:

*Prévisions Locales: In the national feed, this is a three-minute bulletin provides viewers with the current temperatures, wind speed and weather conditions in different cities, as well as weather information for the rest of the day and 2 days ahead. Those who receive localized MétéoMédia feeds get a comprehensive weather report from their area&#x27;s nearest weather station, including current conditions, precipitation, UV/pollen forecasts as well as expected weather for the next 24 hours, 4, 7 and 14 days. Prévisions Locales broadcasts every 10 minutes.
*Météo Active: A detailed analysis of the current weather across Quebec, including the weather expected statewide over the next five days.
*Nouvelles MétéoMédia: Broadcast at :12 and :42 past the hour, this segment provides a brief summary of the weather and environmental news.
* Nature en action - Broadcast every 10 minutes on the 3&#x27;s, a show-reel of significant weather making headlines around the world.
MétéoMédia also provides seasonal segments, include: Prévisions Pollen (spring/summer), Prévisions UV (spring/summer), Conditions du Ski (autumn/winter)...

<text>The American Mathematical Monthly is a mathematical journal founded by Benjamin Finkel in 1894. It is published ten times each year by Taylor &amp; Francis for the Mathematical Association of America.

The &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; is an expository journal intended for a wide audience of mathematicians, from undergraduate students to research professionals. Articles are chosen on the basis of their broad interest and reviewed and edited for quality of exposition as well as content. In this the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; fulfills a different role from that of typical mathematical research journals. The &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; is the most widely read mathematics journal in the world, according to records on JSTOR.

Tables of contents with article abstracts from 1997–2010 are available online.

The MAA gives the Lester R. Ford Awards annually to &quot;authors of articles of expository excellence&quot; published in the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;.

<text>Stephen VIII Báthory (, ) (1477–1534) was a Hungarian noble.

==Biography==
He was a son of Nicholas Báthory (1462–1500) of the Somlyó branch of the Báthory family, and his wife, Sophia Bánffy de Losoncz (b. 1477). He was appointed in 1521 adjoin (deputy) of the Voivode of Transylvania, and served under the Voivode John Zápolya. After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Stephen supported Zápolya&#x27;s claim to the Kingship of Hungary and in 1529 was made Voivode of Transylvania.

==Personal life==
He fathered eight children with his wife Catherine Telegdi.

<text>Kenneth Campbell, (21 April 1917 – 6 April 1941) was a British airman who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for an attack that damaged the German battlecruiser &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, moored in Brest, France, during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Kenneth Campbell was from Ayrshire and educated at Sedbergh School. He gained a chemistry degree at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge University Air Squadron.

==Second World War==
In September 1939, Campbell was mobilised for service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) following the outbreak of the Second World War. Flying Officer Campbell joined No. 22 Squadron RAF in September 1940, piloting the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber. Campbell torpedoed a merchant vessel near Borkum in March 1941. Days later, he escaped from a pair of Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters, despite extensive damage to his aircraft. Two days later, on a &#x27;Rover&#x27; patrol he torpedoed another vessel, off IJmuiden.

On 6 April 1941 over Brest Harbour, France, Flying Officer Campbell attacked the German battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. He flew his Beaufort through the gauntlet of concentrated anti-aircraft fire from about 1000 weapons of all calibres and launched a torpedo at a height of .

The attack had to be made with absolute precision: the &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was moored only some away from a mole in Brest&#x27;s inner harbour. For the attack to be effective, Campbell would have to time the release to drop the torpedo close to the side of the mole. That Campbell managed to launch his torpedo accurately is testament to his courage and determination. The ship was severely damaged below the waterline and was obliged to return to the dock whence she had come only the day before; she was put out of action for six months, lessening the threat to Allied shipping crossing the Atlantic.

Generally, once a torpedo was dropped, an escape was made by low-level jinking at full throttle. Because of rising ground surrounding the harbour, Campbell was forced into a steep banking turn, revealing the Beaufort&#x27;s full silhouette to the gunners. The aircraft met a withering wall of flak and crashed into the harbour. The Germans buried Campbell and his three crew mates, Sergeants J. P. Scott DFM RCAF (navigator), R. W. Hillman (wireless operator) and W. C. Mulliss (air gunner), with full military honours. His valour was only recognised when the French Resistance managed to pass along news of his brave deeds to Britain.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 13 March 1942, reading

==Legacy==
At a small ceremony in his home town of Saltcoats in Ayrshire on 6 April 2000, the 59th anniversary of Campbell&#x27;s death at Brest, a memorial plaque and bench were unveiled by his sister-in-law, and his 90-year-old brother handed over his VC to the safekeeping of the commanding officer of the present-day No. 22 Squadron.

The RAF named their original Vickers VC10 aircraft after Victoria Cross holders. XR808 is named after Kenneth Campbell.

A memorial to him stands in his old school, Sedbergh, commemorating his brave deeds.

A room is named after him at the town headquarters of Cambridge University Air Squadron. At RAF Wittering, the RAF base used for flying training by CUAS, the Campbell Building is named after him, which hosts the CUAS and London University Air Squadron offices.

<text>The Most Beautiful House in the World is a book published in 1989 by Canadian architect, professor and writer Witold Rybczynski.

&quot;The Most Beautiful House in the World&quot; recounts Rybczynski&#x27;s experience building a house for himself and his wife. As he describes the long process of designing and constructing the house (essentially alone), he meanders through various related topics, eventually coming to the point where he can answer the question hidden in the title of the book: &quot;What is the most beautiful house in the world?&quot;

<text>ELAN is an interpreted educational programming language for learning and teaching systematic programming. (Note: In May 2023 design commenced on a new programming language named &#x27;Elan&#x27; also designed for teaching and learning programming in schools, but it has no historical connection to the &#x27;ELAN&#x27; language described here.)

It was developed in 1974 by C.H.A. Koster and a group at Technische Universität Berlin as an alternative to BASIC in teaching, and approved for use in secondary schools in Germany by the &quot;Arbeitskreis Schulsprache&quot;. It was in use until the late 1980s in a number of schools in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary for informatics teaching in secondary education, and used at the Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands for teaching systematic programming to students from various disciplines and in teacher courses.

The language design focuses strongly on structured programming, and has a special construction for stepwise refinement, allowing students to focus on top-down design, and bottom-up coding.

The microkernel operating system Eumel began as a runtime system (environment) for ELAN.

<text>Well poisoning is the act of malicious manipulation of potable water resources in order to cause illness or death, or to deny an opponent access to fresh water resources.

Well poisoning has been historically documented as a strategy during wartime since antiquity, and was used both offensively (as a terror tactic to disrupt and depopulate a target area) and defensively (as a scorched earth tactic to deny an invading army sources of clean water). Rotting corpses (both animal and human) thrown down wells were the most common implementation; in one of the earliest examples of biological warfare, corpses known to have died from common transmissible diseases of the Pre-Modern era such as bubonic plague or tuberculosis were especially favored for well-poisoning.

== History of implementation==
===Instances of medieval usage===
Well poisoning has been used as an important scorched earth tactic at least since medieval times. In 1462, for example, Prince Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia utilized this method to delay his pursuing adversaries. Nearly 500 years later during the Winter War, the Finns rendered wells unusable by putting animal carcasses or feces in them in order to passively combat invading Soviet forces.

===Instances of modern usage===

During the 20th century, the practice of poisoning wells has lost most of its potency and practicality against an organized force as modern military logistics ensure secure and decontaminated supplies and resources. Nevertheless, German forces during First World War poisoned wells in France as part of Operation Alberich.

After World War 2 Nakam, a paramilitary organisation of about fifty Holocaust survivors, sought revenge for the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. The group&#x27;s leader Abba Kovner went to Mandatory Palestine in order to secure large quantities of poison for poisoning water mains to kill large numbers of Germans. His followers infiltrated the water system of Nuremberg. However, Kovner was arrested upon arrival in the British zone of occupied Germany and had to throw the poison overboard.

Israel poisoned the wells and water supplies of certain Palestinian towns and villages as part of their biological warfare program during the 1948 Palestine war, including a successful operation that caused a typhoid epidemic in Acre in early May 1948, and an unsuccessful attempt in Gaza that was foiled by the Egyptians in late May.

In the late 20th century, accusations of well-poisoning were brought up, most notoriously in relation to the Kosovo Liberation War. In the 21st century, Israeli settlers have been condemned due to suspicions of poisoning wells of villages in the occupied Palestine.

==As libel against Jews==
=== Medieval accusations against Jews ===

Despite some vague understanding of how diseases could spread, the existence of viruses and bacteria was unknown in medieval times, and the outbreak of disease could not be scientifically explained. Any sudden deterioration of health was often blamed on poisoning. Europe was hit by several waves of the Black Death throughout the late Middle Ages. Crowded cities were especially hard hit by the disease, with death tolls as high as 50% of the population. In their distress, emotionally distraught survivors searched desperately for an explanation. The city-dwelling Jews of the Middle Ages, living in walled-up, segregated ghetto districts, aroused suspicion. An outbreak of plague thus became the trigger for Black Death persecutions, with hundreds of Jews burned at the stake, or rounded up in synagogues and private houses that were then set aflame.

Walter Laqueur writes in his book &quot;The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day&quot;:
There were no mass attacks against &quot;Jewish poisoners&quot; after the period of the Black Death, but the accusation became part and parcel of antisemitic dogma and language. It appeared again in early 1953 in the form of the &quot;doctors&#x27; plot&quot; in Stalin&#x27;s last days, when hundreds of Jewish physicians in the Soviet Union were arrested and some of them killed on the charge of having caused the death of prominent Communist leaders... Similar charges were made in the 1980s and 1990s in radical Arab nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist propaganda that accused the Jews of spreading AIDS and other infectious diseases.

===Modern instances of antisemitic libel===

Allegations of well poisoning entwined with antisemitism have also emerged in the discourse around modern epidemics and pandemics such as swine flu, Ebola, avian flu, SARS, and COVID-19.

;EU address by Mahmoud Abbas

In his address to the European Parliament on 23 June 2016, in Brussels, Palestinian Authority president and PLO chairman Mahmoud Abbas made an unsubstantiated allegation, &quot;accusing rabbis of poisoning Palestinian wells&quot;. This was based on false media reports saying Israeli rabbis were inciting the poisoning of water of Palestinians, led by a rabbi Shlomo Mlma or Mlmad from the Council of Rabbis in the West Bank settlements. A rabbi by that name could not be located, nor is such an organization listed.

Abbas said: &quot;Only a week ago, a number of rabbis in Israel announced, and made a clear announcement, demanding that their government poison the water to kill the Palestinians ... Isn&#x27;t that clear incitement to commit mass killings against the Palestinian people?&quot;
The speech received a standing ovation. The speech was described as &quot;echoing anti-Semitic claims&quot;. A day later, on Saturday 26 June, Abbas admitted that &quot;his claims at the EU were baseless&quot;. Abbas&#x27; further said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t intend to do harm to Judaism or to offend Jewish people around the world.&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in reaction, that Abbas had spread a &quot;blood libel&quot; in his European Parliament address.

<doc id="1179508" wikidata="Q4150797" url="?curid=1179508" title="Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group">
<text>The mission of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) (originally designated as Special Study Group 2 or SSG-2 of the G10) is to investigate emerging threats to the security of banknotes and to propose solutions for implementation by issuing authorities. The CBCDG is a working group of 35 central banks and note printing authorities, and is chaired by Thomas Jordan, the chairman of the Swiss National Bank.

The CBCDG maintains a website designed to advise the public about national laws related to the reproduction of banknotes.

== History ==

The CBCDG was established by the G10 central banks in 2000, in order to counter the threat of computer-based banknote counterfeiting.

In 2004, CBCDG announced the development of a &quot;Counterfeit Deterrence System&quot; (CDS) incorporating a technical means for the detection of banknotes. This system was reportedly developed by the U.S.-based watermark technology company Digimarc. 

Adobe Systems was subsequently the subject of controversy in when it was revealed that the firm had voluntarily adopted the CDS in Adobe Photoshop, preventing Photoshop from processing some images of currency. Jasc (publisher of Paint Shop Pro) and Adobe stated that they had implemented CDS; they reportedly did not receive technical details of the CDS algorithm (in other words, it was provided to them as a black box). Some artists and professional graphic designers suggested that the CDS would make it more difficult for them to use Photoshop to produce images that used currency in lawful ways. Steven J. Murdoch has begun a technical investigation of how the CDS works.

As of 2022, Digimarc was still partnered with the CBCDG; the company announced that it had renewed an existing agreement with the group, which would now last through the end of 2029.

== Member banks ==

The CBCDG consists of central banks in 34 separate countries, as well as the European Central Bank. The countries participating in the CBCDG are:

<text>Kingsland Road is the name given to an East London stretch of the A10 road within the London Borough of Hackney in England. The A10 was originally a Roman Road better known as Ermine Street or sometimes the Old North Road.

The name &quot;Kingsland Road&quot; is used from the junction with Old Street and Hackney Road (the section of the A10 south of this is Shoreditch High Street) north to the junction with Balls Pond Road and Dalston Lane, where it changes its name to Kingsland High Street. Kingsland Road means the road &quot;to&quot; Kingsland, an old settlement that has been absorbed by modern Dalston.

The quality and variety of architectural styles present along the road has led to the Kingsland Road corridor being designated a conservation area.

The Museum of the Home formerly known as Geffrye Museum is located on Kingsland Road. There are both wealthy and parts with almshouses there.

The band Kingsland Road named themselves &quot;Kingsland&quot; after the road, before later expanding their name.

<text>Louis Applebaum (April 3, 1918April 19, 2000) was a Canadian film score composer, administrator, and conductor.

== Early life ==
He was born in Toronto, Ontario, and studied at the Toronto Conservatory of Music with Leo Smith and the University of Toronto with Boris Berlin, Healey Willan and Ernest MacMillan. He also studied composition privately in New York.

== Film composition ==
Applebaum composed approximately 250 film scores for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) between 1942 and 1960, serving as its music director from 1942 to 1948, then as a consultant from 1949 to 1953. His NFB credits include &quot;Royal Journey&quot; (1951), &quot;The Stratford Adventure&quot; (1954) and &quot;Paddle to the Sea&quot; (1966).

He was nominated, along with co-composer Ann Ronell, for an Academy Award for the score of the 1945 war film, &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot;.

<doc id="1179522" wikidata="Q1637942" url="?curid=1179522" title="Inkubus Sukkubus">
<text>Inkubus Sukkubus are an English goth and pagan rock band, formed in 1989 by Candia Ridley, Tony McKormack and Adam Henderson, who have been described as one of the most enduringly popular underground Goth bands in the UK. They also have been described by Mick Mercer as a &quot;zombie version of Fleetwood Mac&quot; in his book &quot;Hex Files: The Goth Bible&quot;.

==History==
Inkubus Sukkubus have released albums and toured the UK and internationally ever since their formation as Incubus Succubus in 1989.

In 1995, the band adopted the name Inkubus Sukkubus, citing numerology as the reason for the change, and signed to Resurrection Records. The live line-up changed significantly, adopting the use of a drum machine and sequenced backing, with some additional support by a bodhrán, and Adam Henderson moving back to bass.

In 1996, the band appeared live on British national television on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, performing the track &#x27;Heartbeat Of The Earth&#x27;.

The band have played many of Europe&#x27;s major dark alternative festivals including Amphi, M&#x27;era Luna, and the Wave-Gotik-Treffen at Leipzig.

In June 2017, the band hosted a weekend event at St Briavels Castle in the Forest of Dean – a celebration of midsummer with storytelling, history, Egyptian dancing, and a handfasting ceremony. 
==Members==
The group currently consists of guitarist Tony McKormack (ex-Screaming Dead), vocalist Candia McKormack and bassist Roland Link. The band uses a drum machine and sequencer to provide percussion and orchestral backing. They also perform as a fully acoustic act with Abigail Blackman on cello, Nick Gibbs on violin, and Marcus Gilvear on drums.

*Candia McKormack – vocals, lyrics, bodhrán
*Tony McKormack – guitar, keyboards, mandolin, lute, production, songwriting, lyrics, programming, video creation, vocals (ex-Screaming Dead, also in Vampire Division)
*Roland Link – bass guitar

In 2013, Candia was the model for a painting called &quot;The Sukkubus&quot;, by the award winning fantasy artist, Larry Elmore for use in his Kickstarter.

In 2016, Candia was painted by artist Russell Haines for her &#x27;Faith&#x27; exhibition, at Gloucester Cathedral. The band also performed at the launch event which the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, attended.
(Members of Inkubus Sukkubus are wiccans)

<doc id="1179525" wikidata="Q720080" url="?curid=1179525" title="Willis Conover">
<text>Willis Clark Conover, Jr. (December 18, 1920 – May 17, 1996) was a jazz producer and broadcaster on the Voice of America for over forty years. He produced jazz concerts at the White House, the Newport Jazz Festival, and for movies and television. By arranging concerts where people of all races were welcome, he is credited with desegregating Washington, D.C., nightclubs. Conover is credited with keeping interest in jazz alive in the countries of Eastern Europe through his nightly broadcasts during the Cold War.

== Youth ==
As a young man, Conover was interested in science fiction, and published a science-fiction fanzine, &quot;Science Fantasy Correspondent&quot;. This brought him into contact with horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. The correspondence between Lovecraft, who was at the end of his life, and the young Conover, has been published as &quot;Lovecraft at Last&quot;.

Conover&#x27;s father had intended for him to attend The Citadel and follow his family&#x27;s history of military service. Instead, he attended the Maryland State Teacher&#x27;s College at Salisbury, Maryland, and became a radio announcer for WTBO in Cumberland, Maryland.

He later moved to Washington, D.C., and focused on jazz in his programming, especially the Duke Ellington hour on Saturday nights. His guests on this program and Saturday morning shows included many artists, such as Boyd Raeburn.

== Voice of America ==
Conover came to work at the Voice of America, and became known to jazz lovers via the hour-long program &quot;Voice of America Jazz Hour&quot;. His slow delivery and the use of scripts written in &quot;special English&quot; made his programmes more widely accessible and he is said to have become the first teacher of English to a whole generation of East European jazz lovers. Conover was not well known in the United States, even among jazz aficionados, as the Voice of America did not broadcast domestically except on shortwave, but his visits to Eastern Europe and Soviet Union brought huge crowds and star treatment for him. He was a celebrity figure in the Soviet Union, where the Voice of America was a prime source of information as well as music.

In 1956, Conover conducted a series of interviews with jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Stan Getz, Peggy Lee, Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman, and Art Tatum. His interview with Tatum is reputedly &quot;the only known in-depth recorded interview with the pianist&quot;. These interviews were selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Death==

Conover died of lung cancer on May 17, 1996, at age 75. He had been a smoker for 57 years. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

In 2001, on the fifth anniversary of his death, US Embassy in Moscow and Moscow jazz society co-organized a commemorative concert in Moscow.

== Legacy ==
Conover&#x27;s broadcasts influenced a wave of Russian and Polish jazz musicians, such as Leo Feigin and Adam Makowicz.

In 1990, Conover was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

In 2015, the University of North Texas announced its Willis Conover Collection would make digitized copies of Conover&#x27;s programs available online.

<doc id="1179527" wikidata="Q2338847" url="?curid=1179527" title="Royton">
<text>Royton is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 21,284 in 2011. Close to the source of the River Irk, near undulating land at the foothills of the South Pennines, it is northwest of Oldham, southeast of Rochdale and northeast of Manchester.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Royton and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British, Roman and Viking activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Royton formed a small township centred on Royton Hall, a manor house owned by a long succession of dignitaries which included the Byrons and Radcliffes. A settlement expanded outwards from the hall which, by as late as 1780, &quot;contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages&quot;. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.

Royton has the distinction of being the first town where a powered cotton mill was built; at Thorp in 1764, and is one of the first localities in the world to have adopted the factory system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Royton had emerged as a mill town. At its zenith, there were 40 cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—employing 80% of the local population. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in Royton&#x27;s textile industry during the mid-20th century, and its last mill closed in 2002.

Today, fewer than a dozen mills are still standing, the majority of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres. Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning, Royton&#x27;s population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Royton is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and it has been suggested that the Rye crop is the root of the name; &quot;Roy-&quot; is derived from Rye, with the Old English suffix &quot;-ton&quot; added to imply &quot;rye farm&quot; or &quot;rye settlement&quot;. The first known written record of the name Ryeton (or Ryton) was in a survey of Lancashire in 1212, although the name is believed to date from the 7th century as a result of Anglian colonisation which followed the Battle of Chester.

===Early history===
There is evidence of Stone Age human activity in the area, by way of a Neolithic stone axe found at Royton Park. The ancient Britons are thought to have inhabited the area, and the Romans to have traversed it; the remains of a Roman or Early Medieval bloomery was discovered in 1836. There is no physical manifestation of the Vikings/Norsemen in the locality, but toponymic evidence implies they have been present; the hamlet of Thorp is the oldest settled locality in Royton, and its name is of Old Norse origin meaning &quot;farm, estate or village&quot;.

Unmentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, Royton does not appear in records until 1212, when it was documented to have been a thegnage estate, or manor, comprising twelve oxgangs of land, with an annual rate of 24 shillings payable by the tenant, William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas&#x27;s daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from this exchange that the Byron family came to use Royton as their chief place of residence until the early part of the 17th century.

The early history of Royton is linked closely with what was then its manor house, Royton Hall, which was inhabited by the Byron family for over 350 years. During that period the Byrons&#x27; involvement in regional and national affairs added prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township. John de Byron was a witness to the charter of incorporation of 1301, which elevated the township of Manchester to the status of a borough.

A descendant of John—John Byron—served as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1572, and was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1579. John served as Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire at the time of the Spanish Armada, and sourced infantry from Royton towards the English military. His son, also called John, fought during the English Civil War on the side of the Cavaliers. His actions led to making him John Byron, 1st Baron Byron of Rochdale by way of a peerage granted by King Charles I. Following the regicide of Charles I, and the rise of Cromwellian England, Baron Byron&#x27;s possessions, including his lands in Royton, were confiscated. Royton Hall was then purchased by Thomas Percival, a wealthy linen manufacturer whose descendants continued to occupy the hall until around 1814. The hall was then inherited by the Radcliffe Baronets.

===Textiles and the Industrial Revolution===

Apart from the dignitaries who lived in Royton Hall, the population of Royton during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers and farmers, most of whom were involved with pasture, but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the domestic system. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several hamlets, including Thorp, Heyside and Royton village itself as the nucleus. During the Early Modern period, the weavers of Royton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers&#x27; cottages, but as both the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the early-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The construction of a water powered cotton mill by Ralph Taylor at Thorp Clough in 1764, is said to be the first structure of its kind.

The construction of more mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to a tenfold increase of Royton&#x27;s population in less than a century; from 260 in 1714 to 2,719 in 1810. Despite its growth as a centre for cotton-cloth production, and the construction of a chapel of ease in 1754, in 1780 Royton was said to have &quot;contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages&quot;. The people of Royton continued to produce cotton goods (mainly cloth) and sell them at the market in Manchester.

During this period of growth, Royton&#x27;s parliamentary representation was limited to two members of parliament for Lancashire, and nationally, the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment for textile weavers. By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack of suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political Radicalism in the region. The Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, began to organise a mass public demonstration in Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Organised preparations took place, and a spy reported that &quot;seven hundred men drilled at Tandle Hill as well as any army regiment would&quot;; a few days later, on 3 August, a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester.

On 16 August 1819, Royton (like its neighbours) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the Peterloo massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400–700 injuries that followed). Royton&#x27;s contingent was of particular note, in that it sent a sizable female section to the demonstration.

Royton&#x27;s damp climate provided the ideal conditions for cotton spinning to be carried out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the cotton factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre.

The Manchester, Oldham and Royton Railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged of the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had begun to encroach upon Royton&#x27;s southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world&#x27;s cotton production.

Supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65, leading to the formation of the Royton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality.

On 26 November 1884 an explosive device containing gunpowder was detonated in Royton Town Hall, in a cellar underneath the offices of Royton&#x27;s local board. An anonymous communication was received by the supposed bomber, stating that he intended the explosion for the Royton School Board because children are not allowed to work at the age of 10 years, and because he wanted the abolition of the Factory Acts. There were no fatalities caused by the explosion, and damage to the building was restricted to smoke damage and shattered windows, doors and woodwork.

The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Royton. However, in as late the 1950s, 80% of Royton&#x27;s population was employed in the textile mills. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Royton&#x27;s textile sector declined gradually to a halt; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 2002. Less than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton, the majority of which are now used for light engineering or as distribution centres.

===Post-industrial history===
Since deindustrialisation, Royton&#x27;s population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised much its former Edwardian terraced housing districts, and the construction of retail and business parks, which provide employment. The town has subsequently been described as &quot;doing better than most&quot; in Greater Manchester. Despite this, since the turn of the millennium Royton has been earmarked for cosmetic gentrification. In the 2000s, Royton was used as a filming location for the BBC One police drama &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, particularly the area near Lion Mill. &quot;Life on Mars&quot; is set in 1970s Manchester.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Royton anciently constituted a thegnage estate, held by tenants who paid tax to the King. Royton during the Middle Ages formed a township in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, and hundred of Salford. Anciently, law and order was upheld in the locality by two constables, chosen by the community and appointed annually by Vestry meetings.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Royton formed part of the Oldham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. Royton&#x27;s first was a local board of health established in 1863; Royton Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. In 1871 Royton was noted as a large village-chapelry, and a sub-district of the Oldham registration district. In 1879, a part of the neighbouring township of Thornham was amalgamated into the area of the local board. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the Local Board became the Royton Urban District, a local government district within the administrative county of Lancashire.

The urban district council was based in Royton Town Hall, which had been purpose-built for the local board in 1880. In 1933, a part of the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton was transferred to Royton Urban District. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Royton Urban District was abolished, and Royton has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Royton has two of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham: Royton North and Royton South.

In terms of parliamentary representation, Royton after the Reform Act 1832 was represented as part of the Oldham parliamentary borough constituency, of which the first Members of Parliaments (MPs) were the radicals William Cobbett and John Fielden. Winston Churchill was the MP between 1900 and 1906. Constituency boundaries changed during the 20th century, and Royton has lain within the Royton (1918–1950), Heywood and Royton (1950–1983), and Oldham Central and Royton (1983–1997) constituencies. Since 1997, Royton has lain within Oldham West and Royton. Until his death in 2015, it was represented in the House of Commons by Michael Meacher, a member of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

At (53.566°, −2.121°) and north-northwest of London, Royton lies at the foothills of the Pennines, roughly above sea level. The larger towns of Rochdale and Oldham lie to the north and south respectively. For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Royton forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, with Manchester city centre itself southwest of Royton.

Described in Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; (1848) as being in &quot;aspect rather wild&quot;, Royton lies in a shallow valley amongst undulating land. The sources of the rivers Irk and Beal are to the northeast and east respectively. The Irk meanders southwesterly into Chadderton, and then onwards to Middleton into Manchester before uniting its waters with the River Irwell in Manchester city centre. The general slope of the land decreases in height away from the Pennines, from east to west, but reaches high points of at Tandle Hill and at the summit of Oldham Edge, a ridge of elevated land which leads to Oldham. The soils of the town are broadly sand with subsoils of clay.

Royton&#x27;s built environment follows a standard urban structure, consisting of residential dwellings centred around a High Street in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Royton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is residential. Tandle Hill is a country park consisting of open grasslands and mature beech woodlands.
Suburban localities in Royton include Haggate, Heyside, Holden Fold, Long Sight (or Longsight), Oozewood, Royley, Salmon Fields, Stott Field, Thornham, and Thorp. Thornham was formerly a township in itself, but was amalgamated into Royton in the late-19th century.

==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Royton (urban-core and sub-area) had a total resident population of 22,238. Royton considered as a combination of the 2001 electoral wards of Royton North and Royton South, had a population of 20,961. The 2001 population density of the urban area was , with a 100 to 92.3 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 25.3% were single (never married) 46.8% married, and 8.4% divorced. Royton&#x27;s 9,204 households included 26.1% one-person, 42.1% married couples living together, 9.3% were co-habiting couples, and 9.6% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 31.7% had no academic qualifications.

At the 2001 UK census, 84.8% of Royton&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 0.8% Muslim, 0.4% Hindu, and 0.1% Buddhist. The census recorded 7.9% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 5.9% did not state their religion.

Royton&#x27;s population has been described as broadly working class with pockets of lower middle class communities, particularly in the southwest of the town, near the border with Chadderton, and a growing middle middle class community to the north near Tandle Hill Country Park.

==Economy==
From the 18th century onwards, Royton&#x27;s economy was closely tied with that of Britain&#x27;s textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in as early as the 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200 collieries in the town. Royton&#x27;s pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.

Since deindustrialisation, Royton&#x27;s economic activity has been focused around a business park at Salmon Fields which includes distribution companies such as 3663 and Holroyd Meek, manufacturing firms including bed manufacturers Slumberland, and formerly included vehicle assembly at Seddon Atkinson. Formerly an area of &quot;green fields&quot;, the Salmon Fields Business Village was proposed in 1983, and developed into a business park later that decade despite objections that the estate would ruin a &quot;beautiful area&quot;, and cause noise pollution. There are additional retail parks in the locality, including the centre (formerly Elk Mill Retail Park), which lies at the start of the A627(M) motorway.

Opposite Royton Town Hall is a shopping precinct containing 23 shop units and a supermarket operated by the Co-operative Food. The site was opened in 1971 and occupies the town&#x27;s former market street, which was demolished in 1969. In 2004 a report noted that a weakness of the precinct is that it lacks a variety of shops.

==Landmarks==

Historically, Royton&#x27;s only landmark was Royton Hall, the township&#x27;s former manor house which was inhabited by local dignitaries from its construction (in as early as the 13th century) to 1814. Part of the hall was erected during the 16th century, but the east wing was crafted in the Elizabethan or Jacobean architectural style. In 1794 it was described as &quot;pleasantly seated in a deep valley, surrounded by high grounds. It is a firm, well built stone edifice of ancient date&quot;.

During the First World War, Royton Hall was used to house Belgian refugees, and following the war was bought by Dr John Thomas Godfrey. After he took his family to South Africa, it stood empty until it was converted into flats. The hall fell into disrepair in the 1930s and was demolished in 1938. The foundations of the structure were excavated in 2005 leading to the discovery of original panes of glass and a Tudor stair tower.

Royton Town Hall is a purpose-built municipal building opened in September 1880, by James Ashworth, the first Chairman of Royton Local Board of Health. It was constructed in a free style of architecture, and includes a domed roof and clock tower topped by a copper cupola. By the entrance is a flagstaff which flies the Union Flag. The clock tower is inscribed on three sides with Latin mottos: &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; (time flies), &quot;Sic Labitur Aetas&quot; (so the years pass by) and &quot;Finem Respice&quot; (have regards to the end). The clock face on the east side, facing Shaw and Crompton is half the size of the other three. A local tale is that when the Church of Holy Trinity at Shaw was constructed in 1869, it had no clock on the western facade of its clock tower, which faced Royton. The reduced clock face size at Royton Town Hall is said to have been a retaliation.

Royton War Memorial lies at the summit of Tandle Hill, and was erected &quot;in memory of the men of Royton who gave their lives for the freedom and honour of their country&quot; during the First World War. It is a Portland stone obelisk, that originally bore plaques listing the fallen, and had a bronze sculpture of Victory at its base. It was commissioned by the Royton War Memorial Committee and unveiled on 22 October 1921 by Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. The original plaques were stolen in 1969, and replacements were later installed in the grounds of Royton&#x27;s Church of St Paul.

Royton Library is a Carnegie library, a gift of Andrew Carnegie. It was opened in 1907 by Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley, an aristocrat and former Member of Parliament for the area. The surnames of four prominent writers—Bacon, Carlyle, Spencer and Milton—are inscribed above one of four windows on the building face, by the entrance.

==Transport==
Public transport in Royton is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. Major A roads link Royton with other settlements, including the A671 road. Originally built as a turnpike between Oldham and Rochdale, the A671 bisects Royton from the southeast, forming the town&#x27;s main street, before continuing northwards through Rochdale, Burnley and terminates at the village of Worston in Lancashire. The M62 motorway runs to the north of the area and is accessed via the A663 at junction 21 and junction 20 via the A627(M) motorway, which terminates at Royton&#x27;s southwestern boundary.

Royton railway station lay at the end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which connected Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured clavicle.

There are frequent buses running through Royton with services to a variety of destinations in Greater Manchester. Bus services operate to Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, Middleton, Oldham, Rochdale, Shaw and Stalybridge are operated by First Greater Manchester on their 24, 64, 181, 182, 402, 408, 409 and 428 services.

==Education==

The Village School of Royton was founded in 1785, and continued to provide education until 1833, when a new school linked with Royton&#x27;s parish church of St Paul, was opened. The village school became the local Sunday School, but split from St Paul&#x27;s in 1838, reopening as a day school. The village school closed in 1907 and was demolished in 1969.
Almost every suburb of Royton is served by a school of some kind, including some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either at or above the national average for test results.

Royton has eight primary schools and two secondary schools, E-Act Royton and Crompton Academy and Our Lady&#x27;s RC High School. E-Act Royton and Crompton Academy is a coeducational, secondary comprehensive school for 11- to 16-year-olds. It has Science College status and was constructed in 1968. Our Lady&#x27;s RC High School is a coeducational Roman Catholic high school and sixth form college for 11- to 19-year-olds. It was established in 1961 and specialialises in Mathematics and Computing. In the 2000s, Oldham Council and the Diocese of Salford agreed to merge Our Lady&#x27;s with the St Augustine of Canterbury RC High School in Werneth. However, the proposal, which would have a newly built Catholic secondary on a new site in the 2010s, was met with protest.

==Sports==
Royton Town F.C. is an amateur association football club which was established as the Stotts Benham works side in the Rochdale Alliance League, but changed its name to Royton Town in 1985. The team won the Rochdale Alliance Premier Division treble and were unbeaten for two and a half seasons, progressing to the Lancashire Amateur League in 1994. Since 2001–2002 it has played in the Premier Division of the Manchester Football League.

Royton Cricket Club, plays in the Central Lancashire Cricket League (winning it on two occasions in 1914 and 1980). The Crompton and Royton Golf Club lies on the western fringe of the town, and has a prime heathland 18-hole golf course, spanning . The club operates a variety of open competitions.

Royton Amateur Swimming and Water Polo Club has been serving the town for over 100 years and is affiliated to the Central Lancashire Swimming Association.

==Religion==
Royton had no medieval church of its own, and for ecclesiastical purposes, lay within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when this diocese was divided and Royton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created. For ritual baptisms, marriages and burials, the people of Royton, a Christian community, had to travel to churches that lay outside of the township&#x27;s boundaries, including Oldham, St Mary&#x27;s, Middleton, St Leonard&#x27;s or Prestwich, St Mary&#x27;s.

A chapel of ease under the mother church of Prestwich, St Mary&#x27;s, was built between 1754 and 1757, paid for by voluntary contributions. The chapel was consecrated on 1 July 1757, dedicated to Paul the Apostle. St Paul&#x27;s Chapel was extended throughout the 19th century as the population of Royton grew, with a tower and clock added in 1828 and extensions in 1854 and again in 1883. The nave of the chapel was demolished in 1889 and the existing church building in neo-Gothic style was erected. St Paul&#x27;s is in the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester. The Westwood Moravian Church congregation has recently relocated to Royton.

In addition to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton. The Religious Society of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in as early as the 1650s. A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775. Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton, but it was not until 1854 that a workshop was established in the town. Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a room in a Royley building, with its first purpose-built church being erected in 1867.

Roman Catholicism in Royton after the English Reformation began in 1874, when a disused factory was used as a chapel. Sir Percival Radcliffe, the then owner of Royton Hall, gave land and £2,000 towards the construction of a new Catholic school-chapel which opened in 1880; the local priest lived at Royton Hall. A rectory was built in 1901 and in 1966 the church, dedicated to saints Aidan and Oswald, was rebuilt. Royton, which forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, continues to have a Catholic community, supported by Our Lady&#x27;s R.C. High School.

==Public services==
Home Office policing in Royton is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. Before its demolition in 2015 there had been a police station in Royton since 1855. Public transport is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.

There are no hospitals in Royton, although the Royal Oldham Hospital lies at Royton&#x27;s boundary in neighbouring Coldhurst, in Oldham; some local health care is provided by Royton Health and Well-being Centre, an NHS surgery under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust. The Royton Health and Well-being Centre, which opened in October 2010, replaced Royton Health Centre which had been criticised for its limited space and poor layout. The Primary Care Trust plan to sell the old Royton Health Centre premises.

The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport in the area. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small specialist clinics and surgeries. Dr Kershaw&#x27;s Hospice was opened in 1989, but traces its origins to a cottage hospital built in the 1930s with a legacy from Dr John Kershaw, a local General Practitioner and Medical Officer for Health. Dr Kershaw&#x27;s Hospice, a registered charity, provides specialist palliative care for adults with non-curable life-threatening illnesses.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill at the Beal Valley. Royton&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the town. United Utilities also manages Royton&#x27;s drinking and waste water; water supplies are sourced from several local reservoirs, including Dovestone and Chew.

==Notable people==

Historically, Royton was chiefly distinguished by the presence of the Byrons and Radcliffes, both lines of dignitaries who lived in the locality. John Lees of Turf Lane in Royton was an inventor who made a substantial improvement to machinery for carding cotton in 1772. John Hogan was a Royton-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the British and Commonwealth forces.

Jack Wild, although described as the &quot;quintessential Cockney kid&quot;, was born in Royton in 1952, eight years before he moved to London with his parents in 1960. Wild played the role of the Artful Dodger in the 1968 musical film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Other notable people from Royton include actor Kieran O&#x27;Brien, who gained notoriety for his role in the 2004 film &quot;9 Songs&quot;, glamour model Michelle Marsh, and radio and television presenter Nick Grimshaw.

<doc id="1179540" wikidata="Q2500587" url="?curid=1179540" title="William Allen (VC 1879)">
<text>William Wilson Allen ( – 12 March 1890) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in January 1879, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Allen had joined the 24th Regiment at Aldershot in 1859. He was about 35 years old, a sergeant who had recently been reduced in rank to corporal for being drunk on duty. He was in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in action.

On 22 and 23 January 1879 at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa, Corporal Allen and another man (Frederick Hitch) kept communication with the hospital open, despite being severely wounded. Their determined conduct enabled the patients to be withdrawn from the hospital, and when incapacitated by their wounds from fighting, they continued, as soon as their wounds were dressed, to serve out ammunition to their comrades during the night.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant for the second time.

==Death==
Allen died of pneumonia in the 1889–1890 flu pandemic on 12 March 1890 at 85 Monnow Street, Monmouth at the age of 46. His body was buried at Monmouth Cemetery, Monmouthshire, with the cost of the grave and the headstone being provisioned by the South Wales Borderers Regiment. A posthumous charity fund was set up to assist his family, his wife, Sarah Ann and his seven children. 
His Victoria Cross medal is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh at Brecon.

==Cultural references==
Allen was portrayed by the actor Glynn Edwards in the 1964 cinema film &quot;Zulu&quot;.

<doc id="1179541" wikidata="Q969328" url="?curid=1179541" title="RMMV Stirling Castle">
<text>RMMV &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; was a British ocean liner of the Union-Castle Line built by Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast for the Southampton to South Africa mail service. She was launched on 15 August 1935 and was the first of two identical sister ships, being joined a few months later by the &quot;Athlone Castle&quot;. 

A third, slightly larger, ship of the class, the &quot;Capetown Castle&quot;, joined them in 1938.

==Propulsion==
Harland and Wolff built her two Burmeister &amp; Wain engines under license. They were the largest marine oil engines constructed in Britain until then. Each engine was a double-acting 10-cylinder marine two-stroke diesels developing 24,000 hp with bore x stroke x . Each engine was high from the centre of the crankshaft, long and weighed , and drove a single screw.

==Service==
&quot;Stirling Castle&quot; left Southampton on her maiden voyage on 7 February 1936. In August of that year she set a new record for the route, reaching Table Bay in 13 days 9 hours, beating the previous record of 14 days, 18 hours, and 57 minutes had set in 1893.

During World War II, &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; was used as a troopship. She came through the war unscathed after steaming some 505,000 miles and carrying 128,000 personnel.

She was released from government service in 1946. In 1946, she sailed from Southampton on 31 August for Australia arriving at Fremantle on 28 September. Her builders then refitted her and she resumed passenger service in 1947.

The mail service was accelerated in 1965 and &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; and her sisters had insufficient speed to maintain the new schedule. They were replaced by two new fast cargo ships (the new schedule required only seven ships rather than eight) and &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; was withdrawn from service upon arrival at Southampton on 30 November 1965.

==Fate==
A proposed sale to Taiwan breakers (where her sister had gone two months earlier) fell through and she was instead sold for scrapping in Japan. She left Southampton on 1 February 1966 for Mihara. She arrived there on 3 March 1966 to be broken up by Nichimen Co.

<text>Lieutenant Wallace Lloyd Algie, (10 June 1891 – 11 October 1918) was a Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the CEF during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 11 October 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, exactly a month before the armistice with Germany.

==Early life==
Wallace Lloyd Algie was born on 10 June 1891 at 1155 King Street at Alton in Ontario, Canada, the son of James and Rachel Algie. His father was a medical doctor whose practice covered Peel County, near Toronto, and had practiced medicine for over twenty-five years. The family later moved to Toronto itself sometime in 1908, settling in at 75 Dewson Street. Algie was educated at Alton Public School and when his schooling was completed, he worked in banking before entering the Royal Military College of Canada. After graduating from there as a lieutenant, he served initially in the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada and then the 40th Northumberland Regiment. He was known to play the euphonium in the regimental band which was quite common at that time for officers and men of musical inclination. 

==First World War==
In April 1916, almost two years after the First World War began, Algie enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), following in the footsteps of one of his brother&#x27;s who had already volunteered to serve in the war. Initially posted to the 95th Battalion, he was later transferred to the 20th Battalion, which arrived in France the following year to join the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade, part of the 2nd Canadian Division, on the Western Front. He took part in the Battle of Hill 70 and in the subsequent operations around Lens.

On 11 October 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, and as the war was coming to its end, the 4th Brigade was supporting the 6th Canadian Brigade in an attack on the German-held village of Iwuy, north east of Cambrai in France. Aware that German soldiers were bringing up more machine-guns, Algie led a group of volunteers past his battalion&#x27;s designated area of operations and captured two machine-guns, which were brought to bear on the Germans. In doing so he secured the east end of Iwuy and returned to his lines for reinforcements. He was killed when leading them back to the area under the control of his men. His actions on 11 October contributed to the capture of the entire village later that day, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation that was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; for his VC read:
Algie&#x27;s body was retrieved and he was buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s Niagara Cemetery at Iwuy, north east of Cambrai.

==Victoria Cross==
On 28 March 1919, Algie&#x27;s father was presented with his son&#x27;s posthumous VC by the Lieutenant Governor of Toronto. The VC was later sold at auction to Lord Ashcroft in 1995 for £17,800, and is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum. The exact whereabouts of the other medals that Algie was entitled to, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal, are not known but they are most likely in the possession of a collector.

<text>The Northrop N-9M was an approximately one-third scale, span all-wing aircraft used for the development of the full size, wingspan Northrop XB-35 and YB-35 flying wing long-range, heavy bomber. First flown in 1942, the N-9M (M for Model) was the third in a lineage of all-wing Northrop aircraft designs that began in 1929 when Jack Northrop succeeded in early experiments with his single pusher propeller, twin-tailed, twin-boom, all stressed metal skin Northrop X-216H monoplane, and a decade later, the dual-propeller N-1M of 1939–1941. Northrop&#x27;s pioneering all-wing aircraft would lead Northrop Grumman many years later to eventually develop the advanced B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which debuted in 1989 in US Air Force inventory.

==Design and development==

On 30 October 1941, the preliminary order for development of the B-35 Flying Wing bomber was confirmed, including engineering, testing, and most importantly a 60 ft (18 m) wingspan, one-third scale aircraft, designated N-9M. It was to be used in gathering data on flight performance and for familiarizing pilots with the program&#x27;s radical, all-wing design. The first N-9M was ordered in the original contract, but this was later expanded to three test aircraft in early 1943. A fourth was ordered a few months later after a crash of the first N-9M destroyed that airframe; this fourth N-9M incorporated various flight test-derived improvements and upgrades, including different, more powerful engines. The four aircraft were designated N-9M-1, -2, -A, and -B, respectively.

The N-9M framework was partially constructed of wood to reduce its overall weight. The wings&#x27; outer surfaces were also skinned with a strong, specially laminated plywood. The central section (roughly equivalent to the fuselage) was made of welded tubular steel. The aircraft were originally powered by two Menasco C6S-1 &quot;Buccaneer&quot; inverted air-cooled straight-six engines, driving twin-bladed propellers, except for the N-9MB which was powered by two Franklin XO-540-7 engines.

==Operational history==
The first flight of the N-9M occurred on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by various mechanical failures, the Menasco engines being the primary source of the problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12 miles (19 km) west of Muroc Army Air Base (now Edwards Air Force Base) on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Actions were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.

When Northrop&#x27;s Flying Wing bomber program was canceled, all remaining N-9M flight test aircraft, except for the final N-9MB, were scrapped. For more than three decades, it slowly deteriorated until the Chino, California Planes of Fame Air Museum acquired the aircraft in 1982 and began the labor-intensive restoration process. For the next two decades, former Northrop employees and other volunteers restored the N-9MB to its final flight configuration. Since 1993, the yellow-and-blue Flying Wing has been exhibited, with flight demonstrations at several airshows every year.

In April 2006, the N-9MB suffered an in-flight engine fire. The aircraft was landed safely with limited damage. Donations to the museum were solicited for its repair, and the aircraft was fully repaired to flight status. It was flown again during the annual Chino airshow on 15–16 May 2010.

On 22 April 2019, the N-9MB was destroyed shortly after takeoff, when it crashed into a prison yard in Norco, California. The pilot was killed but no ground casualties were reported. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the &quot;pilot&#x27;s loss of control for undetermined reasons&quot;, stating that &quot;given the significant fragmentation of the wreckage, the reason for the loss of control could not be determined&quot;.

<text>One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw is a book published in 2000 by Canadian architect, professor and writer Witold Rybczynski.

== History ==
The idea for the book came in 1999 when an editor at &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; asked Rybczynski to write a short essay on the best and most useful common tool of the previous 1,000 years. Rybczynski took the assignment, but as he researched the history of the items in his workshop – hammers and saws, levels and planes – he found that most dated well back into antiquity. At the point of giving up, he asked his wife for ideas. She answered: &quot;You always need a screwdriver for something.&quot;

== Content ==
In the book, Rybczynski explains his discovery that the screwdriver is a relatively new addition to the toolbox, an invention of the Late Middle Ages in Europe and the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese. Leonardo da Vinci was there at the start, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with interchangeable gears. Nevertheless, it took generations for the screw (and with it, the screwdriver and lathe) to come into general use, and it was not until modern times that improvements such as slotted screws came into being. Rybczynski spends some time discussing the Canadian invention, the Robertson screwdriver.

== Reception ==
The book has been noted as relying on outdated histories and revealing of Rybczynski&#x27;s &quot;unfamiliarity with mechanical processes&quot; but has been compared with Samuel C. Florman&#x27;s works towards improving the public understanding of a technical field.

<text>Ali Haidar Khan (21 August 1913 – 15 July 1999) was a Pakistani recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. During the Second World War, at Fusignano, Italy, 31-year-old Ali Haidar, serving in the British Indian Army, performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Details==
He was 31 years old, and a Sepoy in the 6th battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles, in the British Indian Army during World War II. Ali Haidar and his regiment were involved in the evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940. The battalion arrived in Dover, England from Dunkirk in June 1940 and they were soon merged into the other battalions of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles. Ali Haidar&#x27;s battalion was stationed in Brighton for most of the war until it was sent to be part of the Allied liberation of Italy. The regiment was first sent to North Africa to partake in some battles during the North African campaign. Once in North Africa, the Regiment underwent further training at Casablanca. By April 29, 1944, the Regiment had landed in Italy. In 1945, the regiment was in Italy when the following deed took place for which Ali Haidar was awarded the VC.

On 9 April 1945 near Fusignano, Italy, at the start of the Allied Spring 1945 offensive in Italy Haidar&#x27;s battalion was tasked with a difficult assault crossing of the Senio River. Only Sepoy Ali Haidar and the two other men of his section managed to get across under heavy machine-gun fire. Then, without orders, and on his own initiative, Sepoy Ali Haidar, leaving the other two to cover him, charged the nearest post which was about 30 yards away. He threw a grenade and almost at the same time the enemy threw one at him, wounding him severely in the back. In spite of this he kept on and the enemy post was destroyed and four of the enemy surrendered. With utter disregard of his own wounds he continued and charged the next post in which the enemy had one Spandau and three automatics, which were still very active and preventing movement on both banks. He was again wounded, this time in the right leg and right arm. Although weakened by loss of blood, with great determination Sepoy Ali Haidar crawled closer and in a final effort raised himself from the ground, threw a grenade, and charged into the second enemy post. Two enemy were wounded and the remaining two surrendered.

Taking advantage of the outstanding success of Sepoy Ali Haidar&#x27;s dauntless attacks, the rest of the Company charged across the river and carried out their task of making a bridgehead. Sepoy Ali Haidar was picked up and brought back from the second position seriously wounded. He was sent to Lanciano to be treated for his wounds. He then fought in the Arzignano, Marino, Pescara, Verona and Milan sectors of the campaign and eventually retired from the army after the war ended. The conspicuous gallantry, initiative, and determination combined with a complete disregard for his own life shown by this very brave Sepoy in the face of heavy odds were an example to the whole Company. His heroism had saved the rest of the company. With the rapid advance which it was possible to make the Battalion captured 3 officers and 217 other ranks and gained their objectives. The rest of the company were then able to cross the river and establish a bridgehead. Due to his bravery, he received the Victoria Cross from King George VI in October 1945. He retired to a small scrub farm with his wife in his hometown of Kohat and died on 15 July 1999.

==Further information==
He was born in Kohat, North-West Frontier Provinces of the British Indian Empire in what is now Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Pakistan to a Bangash Pashtun family. He would achieve the rank of Naib Subedar in his parent battalion, 6th Royal Battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles which later redesignated as 1st Battalion (Scinde) The Frontier Force Regiment. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London. On 9 April 2017 the Mayor of Lugo di Romagna Davide Ranalli unveiled a Memorial dedicated to VC Ali Haidar upon the Senio River western bank in the vicinity of the Sabbioni area. The ceremony was attended by several Italian politicians including the mayor of Rome.

<text>Turan was the Etruscan goddess of love, fertility and vitality and patroness of the city of Velch.

==Depiction==
In art, Turan was usually depicted as a young winged girl. Turan appears in toilette scenes of Etruscan bronze mirrors. She is richly robed and jeweled in early and late depictions, but appears nude under the influence of Hellenistic art in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. She is paired with her young lover Atunis (Adonis) and figures in the episode of the Judgement of Paris.

==Attributes==
Turan was commonly associated with birds such as the dove, goose and above all the swan, &quot;Tusna&quot;, &quot;the swan of Turan&quot;. Her retinue were called Lasas. Turan may be quite ancient but does not appear on the Piacenza list nor in Martianus list of Etruscan deities. The Etruscan month of July was named after her, although we only know the Latin word for it, &quot;Traneus&quot;.

==Etymology==
Turan was seen as the equivalent to the Roman Venus and the Greek Aphrodite. Her name is the pre-Hellenic root of &quot;Turannos&quot; (absolute ruler, see ), so Turan can be viewed as “Mistress&quot;.

Turan had a sanctuary in the Greek-influenced Gravisca, the port for Tarquinia, where votive gifts inscribed with her name have been found. One inscription calls her &quot;Turan ati&quot;, &quot;Mother Turan&quot; which has been interpreted as connecting her to Venus Genetrix, Venus the mother of Aeneas and progenitor of the Julio-Claudian lineage.

==Legacy==
Turan is one of the few Etruscan goddesses who has survived into Italian folklore from Romagna. Called &quot;Turanna&quot;, she is said to be a fairy, a spirit of love and happiness, who helps lovers.

<text>The Turán tanks were a series of Hungarian medium tanks of World War II. They were produced in two main variants: the original 40M Turán (or Turán I) with a 40 mm gun and later the 41M Turán (or Turán II) with a short-barreled 75 mm gun, improved armour and a new turret. A total of 285 40M Turán I tanks were made. The 40M Turán (Turán I) was originally inspired by and used the features found on the design of the Czechoslovak Škoda T-21 medium tank prototype. The Turán tanks fought on the Eastern Front against the Soviets, and in the defence of Hungary.

A further upgraded prototype variant, the [[43M Turán III|43M Turán]] (or Turán III) was also developed and constructed but did not go into mass production. This had a powerful long-barreled 75 mm gun, further improved armour and again had a new turret. Prototypes were manufactured, but work on the project stopped in 1944 when mass-production terminated in the country.

==History==
In December 1937 the Škoda workshops prepared a prototype of a medium tank, the Škoda T-21, based on the earlier successful LT vz. 35 project. Two prototypes were designed and designated S-IIc, but their construction was never finished. The tank weighed , was armed with a 4.7 cm KPÚV vz. 38 gun, two 7.92 mm machine guns and its maximum armour was increased to 30 mm. The S-II-c was to have an improved 13.8 liter engine giving 250 hp; this increased the maximum speed to roughly 

After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the prototypes were finished under the new designation of T-21, which in turn was a predecessor of a new prototype; the T-22. Two of the latter type were given to Hungary in 1941. It is sometimes reported that the T-22 was the basis for the Turán, but it was actually the T-21 prototype that was used instead. The Hungarian engineers decided to replace the original 47 mm gun with an indigenous 40 mm design for economic and military reasons. Military experts stated that the armour penetration of the 47 mm gun was not better than the homemade 40 mms because the latter had a much higher muzzle velocity. The gun&#x27;s performance was a bit below that of the Panzer III Ausf. H&#x27;s main armament. The modifications of the tank gun were carried out by the Škoda factory – they used the original Czech gun cradle and placed the Hungarian made barrel into it. The frontal armour was increased too, with the engineers riveting a 15 mm armour plate onto the original 35 mm thick frontal armour for 50 mm in total, and the turret was likewise protected by the same arrangement. The Czech machine guns were changed to Hungarian 8 mm Gebauer 34/40.M guns. The overall weight was also increased to over 18 tonnes. Spaced armour in the form of side skirts were added in 1944 as protection from anti-tank rifles such as the PTRS-41 and PTRD-41.

== Variants ==
The Turán was produced in three versions – Turán I, II and III. The Turán I was the original medium tank with the 40 mm gun. The gun, the standard Hungarian light anti-tank gun, fired the same 40×311mmR cartridge as the Bofors 40 mm L/60 anti-aircraft gun, which Hungary produced under license at the time. The turret was of riveted construction. Between 1941 and 1943 a total of 285 40M Turán I tanks were produced.

The combat experiences of 1941 made Hungary realize that the 40.M Turán (Turán I) which was at the time still under development and construction would not meet the expectations of modern medium tanks. The General Staff of the Hungarian Army changed the second order of 309 medium tanks to 87 medium and 222 heavy tanks armed with a 75 mm gun. This order was later changed again in 1941 to 55 medium and 254 heavy tanks. The General Staff also declared that the new heavy tank must be constructed from those Turáns already built without changing the engine and the weight of the new tank must be comparable to the heavy tank. The mentioned heavy tank would become the Turán II.

The prototype of the heavy tank and the new 75 mm gun was ordered from the Institute of Military Technology of the Hungarian Army (HTI) in 1941. The HTI did not have any gun designer nor production departments so they had to choose from an already existing gun and try to modify it. The engineers chose the 75 mm 41M L/25, based on the 18.M field artillery gun – 8 cm Feldkanone M.18 – which had been in service since World War I. The HTI ordered the modification of the gun to be done by the Swedish Bofors company, which willingly accepted.

Both the modifications of the chassis – increasing armor thickness to 50 mm by riveting extra 20 mm armour plates on the frontal armour and lower glacis, changing the driver&#x27;s hatch from a single door which opened to the right to a two-piece folding door which opened to the front, and the prototype of the new gun and turret were finished in January 1942, with the new turret being finished in February 1942. The new 75 mm gun was the first Hungarian tank gun with a horizontal semi-automatic sliding block.

During the installation, the gun cradle cracked and repairs delayed the production of the vehicle even further. On May 6, 1942, all the preparations were done for ground testing, and the gun cradle was repaired. The test was successful and the new heavy tank was put into service as the 41.M &quot;Turán&quot; (also known as &quot;Turán&quot; II or &quot;&quot;Turán&quot; 75 short&quot;). The first Turán IIs were not delivered to their units until September–October 1943 because the production of gun optics and ammunition were delayed.

By that time the Turán II became obsolete as well, but it was still lethal to T-34 medium tanks within 500 meters, which was still good progress compared to previous Hungarian armored vehicles. According to records from 1944, 129 Turán IIs were issued to combat effective units; factory notes recorded that 182-185 41.M Turán heavy tanks (Turán IIs) were manufactured. According to other sources, around 195 Turán IIs were made.

Aside from tank production, the chassis was the basis for the Zrínyi II assault gun. This mounted a 105 mm short gun in the hull and lacked the traversable turret of a tank. A total of 66-72 Zrínyi IIs were made during the war. The only other vehicles known based on this chassis were the Turán III and the Zrínyi I, both of which used the 7.5 cm 43.M tank gun. The 7.5 cm 43.M tank gun was developed from the blueprints of the PaK 40, converted for Hungarian production.

The Turán III&#x27;s prototype with an actual turret was finished in February 1944. Unlike the frontal armour of the hull which was thickened by riveting two armour plates together, the 75 mm thick armour of the turret was made of only one plate. Mobility and firing tests were carried out after the prototype was completed and the prototype was accepted for mass-production. However, no more 43.M Turáns (a.k.a. Turán III or Turán 75 long), or Zrínyi Is were constructed because of the lack of materials and the fact that after the occupation of Hungary in March 1944, Germany did not allow further tank and gun production, restricting the Hungarian industry to only spare part manufacturing level.

It is not known if the Zrínyi I and Turán III were officially put into service, and their fate is unknown. There is at least one account of the Turán III seeing combat.

==Service History==
Turáns were used in fighting on the Eastern Front in Galicia, Transylvania, the Dukla Pass and the Battle of Hungary against the Soviet Union and Romania.

The Turán saw its combat debut with the 2nd Hungarian Armored Division on the 17th of April 1944. Thirty-one 40M Turán I and seventeen 40M Turán II tanks launched an offensive from Solotwina towards the Bistrica River. A number of Turán tanks were captured after the 1944 Royal Coup by the Kingdom of Romania, along with some Toldis and a Zrínyi assault gun. Turans also took part in the Battle of Torda and the Battle of Debrecen where they were deployed against Soviet cavalry attacks at Gyula. After the fighting in Budapest some of the last Turáns surrendered to Soviet forces alongside the last Zrínyi assault gun on the 21st of March 1945 in Bratislava.

==Survivors==
There is only one known surviving Turán tank. It is a Turán II (41M Turán) on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia.

<text>Alfred Werner (12 December 1866 – 15 November 1919) was a Swiss chemist who was a student at ETH Zurich and a professor at the University of Zurich. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913 for proposing the octahedral configuration of transition metal complexes. Werner developed the basis for modern coordination chemistry. He was the first inorganic chemist to win the Nobel Prize, and the only one prior to 1973.

==Biography==
Werner was born in 1866 in Mulhouse, Alsace (which was then part of France, but which was annexed by Germany in 1871). He was raised as Roman Catholic. He was the fourth and last child of Jean-Adam Werner, a foundry worker, and his second wife, Salomé Jeannette Werner, who originated from a wealthy family. He went to Switzerland to study chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute (polytechnikum) in Zurich. Still, since this institute was not empowered to grant doctorates until 1909, Werner received a doctorate formally from the University of Zürich in 1890. After postdoctoral study in Paris, he returned to the Swiss Federal Institute to teach (1892). In 1893 he moved to the University of Zurich, where he became a professor in 1895. In 1894 he became a Swiss citizen.

In his last year, he suffered from a general, progressive, degenerative arteriosclerosis, especially of the brain, aggravated by years of excessive drinking and overwork. He died in a psychiatric hospital in Zürich.

Werner died on 15 November 1919 of arteriosclerosis in Zürich at the age of 52.

==Research==

===Coordination chemistry===
In 1893, Werner was the first to propose correct structures for coordination compounds containing complex ions, in which a central transition metal atom is surrounded by neutral or anionic ligands.

For example, it was known that cobalt forms a &quot;complex&quot; hexamine cobalt (III) chloride, with formula CoCl3•6NH3, but the nature of the association indicated by the dot was mysterious. Werner proposed the structure [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, with the Co3+ ion surrounded by six NH3 at the vertices of an octahedron. The three Cl− are dissociated as free ions, which Werner confirmed by measuring the conductivity of the compound in an aqueous solution, and also by chloride anion analysis using precipitation with silver nitrate. Later, magnetic susceptibility analysis was also used to confirm Werner&#x27;s proposal for the chemical nature of CoCl3•6NH3.

For complexes with more than one type of ligand, Werner succeeded in explaining the number of isomers observed. For example, he explained the existence of two tetramine isomers, &quot;Co(NH3)4Cl3&quot;, one green and one purple. Werner proposed that these are two geometric isomers of formula [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl, with one Cl− ion dissociated as confirmed by conductivity measurements. The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is &quot;trans&quot; with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is &quot;cis&quot; with the two Cl at adjacent vertices.

Werner also prepared complexes with optical isomers, and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic chiral compound lacking carbon, known as hexol with formula [Co(Co(NH3)4(OH)2)3]Br6.

===Nature of valence===
Before Werner, chemists defined the valence of an element as the number of its bonds without distinguishing different types of bonds. However, in complexes such as [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 for example, Werner considered that the Co-Cl bonds correspond to a &quot;primary&quot; valence of 3 at long distance, while the Co-NH3 bonds which correspond to a &quot;secondary&quot; or weaker valence of 6 at shorter length. This secondary valence of 6 he referred to as the coordination number which he defined as the number of molecules (here of NH3) directly linked to the central metal atom. In other complexes, he found coordination numbers of 4 or 8.

On these views, and other similar views, in 1904 Richard Abegg formulated what is now known as Abegg&#x27;s rule which states that the difference between the maximum positive and negative valence of an element is frequently eight. This rule was used later in 1916 when Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the &quot;octet rule&quot; in his cubical atom theory.

In modern terminology, Werner&#x27;s primary valence corresponds to the oxidation state, and his secondary valence is called coordination number. The Co-Cl bonds (in the above example) are now classed as ionic, and each Co-N bond is a coordinate covalent bond between the Lewis acid Co3+ and the Lewis base NH3.

<text>William Amey (5 March 1881 – 28 May 1940) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Amey was 37 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 1/8th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 November 1918 at Landrecies, France, when many hostile machine-gun nests were missed by the leading troops owing to fog, Lance-Corporal Amey led his section against a machine-gun nest under heavy fire and drove the garrison into a neighbouring farm, finally capturing 50 prisoners and several machine-guns. Later, single-handed and under heavy fire he attacked a machine-gun post in a farmhouse, killed two of the garrison and drove the remainder into a cellar until assistance arrived. Subsequently, he rushed a strongly held post, capturing 20 more prisoners.

Amey later achieved the rank of corporal, and was demobilised in 1919. He is buried at Leamington Cemetery, Brunswick Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers Museum (Royal Warwickshire), in [Pageant House, 2 Jury street Warwick, England.

<text>Notes &amp; Queries is a weekly column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper which publishes readers&#x27; questions together with (often humorous) answers submitted by other readers.

The column first appeared on 13 November 1989, and was the idea of leader writer and columnist David McKie and Alan Rusbridger, then newly appointed as features editor of the paper. David McKie says he was inspired by seeing an information exchange notice board outside the poetry library at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Although originally envisaged as a serious column, &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot; quickly became known for the bizarre and whimsical nature of its questions and the wit and humour of its answers. Spin offs from the column include six books and two BBC television series. It has also given rise to various imitations and parodies.

The very first question to appear in &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot; was:

As well as serious answers, one reply was &quot;Concrete one or the other&quot;, thereby setting the tone for subsequent answers (and subsequently questions). Other notable questions that have been featured include:

* &quot;How can I weigh my head?&quot;
* &quot;Why is water wet?&quot;
* &quot;Are slugs edible?&quot;
* &quot;Is this a question?&quot;

Commenting on the continuing popularity of the column, its founding editor Brian Whitaker has said, &quot;If Notes &amp; Queries has any serious purpose, it is surely to promote a healthy scepticism about what we see in print.&quot;

<text>Sikkim National Congress ( SNC) was a political party in the Kingdom of Sikkim. It was founded in 1962, through a merger of Swatantra Dal, Rajya Praja Sammelan, and dissidents of the then-dominant parties, Sikkim State Congress and Sikkim National Party. Kazi Lhendup Dorjee was its leader.

The SNC was formed to be a party representing all ethnic groups in Sikkim, as the previously dominating parties were divided on ethnic lines. It opposed the monarchy in Sikkim and worked for democratic reforms.

In April 1973, Sikkim Janata Congress merged with SNC. In 1974, the first democratically elected government took office in Sikkim. In that election, the party won 31 out of 32 seats.

After the merger of Sikkim with India in 1975, the party merged with the Indian National Congress.

<text>Charles Anderson (1827 – 19 April 1899) was by birth an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Anderson was about 32 years old, and a private in the 2nd Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards during the Indian Mutiny when the action for which he and Thomas Monaghan were awarded the Victoria Cross took place:
He later achieved the rank of corporal. Charles Anderson was buried at Princess Road Cemetery, Seaham, near Sunderland, County Durham in section A, grave 1271.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards Regimental Museum in Cardiff Castle, Wales.

<doc id="1179596" wikidata="Q318048" url="?curid=1179596" title="Nelson Goodman">
<text>Henry Nelson Goodman (7 August 1906 – 25 November 1998) was an American philosopher, known for his work on counterfactuals, mereology, the problem of induction, irrealism, and aesthetics.

==Life and career==
Goodman was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, the son of Sarah Elizabeth (née Woodbury) and Henry Lewis Goodman. He was of Jewish origins. He graduated from Harvard University, AB, &quot;magna cum laude&quot; (1928). During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in Boston, Massachusetts, while studying for a Harvard PhD in philosophy, which he completed in 1941. His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards aesthetics, where he became better known than in logic and analytic philosophy. During World War II, he served as a psychologist in the US Army.

He taught at the University of Pennsylvania, 1946–1964, where his students included Noam Chomsky, Sidney Morgenbesser, Stephen Stich, and Hilary Putnam. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at Brandeis University from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.

In 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.

Goodman died in Needham, Massachusetts.

==Philosophical work==
===Induction and &quot;grue&quot;===
In his book &quot;Fact, Fiction, and Forecast&quot;, Goodman introduced the &quot;new riddle of induction&quot;, so-called by analogy with Hume&#x27;s classical problem of induction. He accepted Hume&#x27;s observation that inductive reasoning (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons).

Hempel&#x27;s confirmation theory argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and evidence statements, which apply to only one thing. Goodman&#x27;s famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate grue, which applies to all things examined before a certain time &quot;t&quot; just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time &quot;t&quot;. If we examine emeralds before time &quot;t&quot; and find that emerald &quot;a&quot; is green, emerald &quot;b&quot; is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds &quot;a, b, c,&quot;..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue. Thus, before time &quot;t&quot;, the apparently law-like statements &quot;All emeralds are green&quot; and &quot;All emeralds are grue&quot; are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously &quot;All emeralds are grue&quot; is not a law-like statement.

Goodman&#x27;s example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial dilemma that &quot;anything can confirm anything&quot;.

===Nominalism and mereology===
Goodman, along with Stanislaw Lesniewski, is the founder of the contemporary variant of nominalism, which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with set theory. Goodman&#x27;s nominalism was driven purely by ontological considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with W. V. O. Quine, Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with set theory – discredited as sole foundations of mathematics as of 1913 (Russell and Whitehead, in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;).

The program of David Hilbert to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1931 by Gödel. Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, Quine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman&#x27;s Penn colleague Richard Milton Martin argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward.

According to Thomas Tymoczko&#x27;s &quot;afterword&quot; in &quot;New directions in the philosophy of mathematics&quot;, Quine had &quot;urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation&quot;, putting the &quot;key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context.&quot; In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of science were merged into quasi-empiricism: the emphasis of mathematical practice as effectively part of the scientific method, an emphasis on method over result.

The Goodman–Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of mereology. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman&#x27;s 1951 &quot;The Structure of Appearance&quot;, a revision and extension of his PhD thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his PhD thesis still did). Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed. Mereology is accordingly &quot;ontologically neutral&quot; and retains some of Quine&#x27;s pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as American Pragmatism).

<text>Field Marshal Frederick Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan (16 October 1865 – 28 August 1946), known as Viscount Kilcoursie from 1887 until 1900, was a British Army officer who served as chief of the imperial general staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, in the 1920s. After being commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in 1885, he served in the Second Boer War as a company commander, then served with distinction during the First World War as a brigade, divisional, corps, and army commander, and later advised the British government on the implementation of the Geddes report, which advocated a large reduction in defence expenditure; he presided over a major reduction in the size of the British Army.

==Early life and military career==
Born into an aristocratic family of Anglo-Irish descent, he was the son of the 9th Earl of Cavan and Mary Sneade Lambart (&quot;née&quot; Olive). He was educated at Eton College, Christ Church, Oxford, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst; As there were no vacancies at that time for his preferred regiment, the Coldstream Guards, so he was instead commissioned as a lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards on 29 August 1885. He gained the courtesy title of Viscount Kilcoursie in 1887 when his father succeeded to the Earldom and was appointed aide-de-camp to Frederick Stanley, the Governor General of Canada, in 1891.

He was promoted to captain on 16 October 1897, after he had been appointed regimental adjutant on 25 August 1897, a position he held until 17 March 1900. By then, the Grenadier Guards were involved in the Second Boer War in South Africa. He saw action as a company commander in the Battle of Biddulphsberg in May 1900, and, having succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles on 14 July 1900, took part in operations against the Boers in 1901 and for which he was later mentioned in despatches. Following the end of the war in June 1902, which prompted him to write in his diary that it was &quot;not far removed from the happiest day of my life&quot;, he left Cape Town on the SS &quot;Sicilia&quot; and returned to Southampton in late July.

After promotion to major on 28 October 1902, he became second-in-command of the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards in July 1905. He was promoted again to lieutenant colonel and appointed commanding officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards on 14 February 1908, taking over from Brevet Colonel Robert Scott-Kerr.

He was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order Fourth Class on 29 June 1910, which was awarded personally to him by George V. He was promoted to colonel on 4 October 1911, After four years as CO of his battalion, he was placed on the half-pay list. By now having &quot;come to the conclusion that his military career had run its course&quot;, he retired from the army on 8 November 1913 and became Master of Foxhounds for the Hertfordshire Hunt. At that time he lived at Wheathampstead House in Wheathampstead in his native Hertfordshire.

==First World War==
He was recalled at the start of the First World War and, after receiving a promotion to the temporary rank of brigadier general on 22 August, took command of the 2nd London Brigade of the 1st London Division, a Territorial Force (TF) unit then stationed in the East End of London.

His stay with the brigade was destined to be short as he was appointed CO of the 4th (Guards) Brigade on 18 September after its commander, Brigadier General Robert Scott-Kerr, his predecessor as CO of the 1st Grenadiers several years earlier, was badly wounded. Cavan, by now in France, went on to lead the brigade, which then formed part of the 2nd Division, at the First Battle of Ypres in October. Included as one of the four battalions under his brigade&#x27;s command was the 1st Battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment, in which many of his old neighbours were serving. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 18 February 1915, he also led the brigade at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915.

At the still relatively young age of 49, Cavan was promoted to major general and given command of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division on 29 June 1915; a mere six weeks later he was appointed the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Guards Division and, having been appointed Commander of the French Legion of Honour on 10 September 1915, he led his division at the Battle of Loos later that month. He was elected an Irish representative peer on 24 September 1915 and as such was one of the last to be so elected before the creation of the Irish Free State. In his role as GOC of the Guards Division he informed Major Winston Churchill of the latter&#x27;s attachment to the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadiers, which formed part of his division, in November 1915.

The following January 1916, Cavan, &quot;his star in the ascendant&quot;, was promoted to temporary lieutenant-general and was placed at the head of XIV Corps and took part in the Battle of the Somme that summer. He was made a Grand Officer of the Belgian Order of the Crown on 2 November 1916 and appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 18 November 1916.

Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 1 January 1917, he led his corps at the Battle of Passchendaele in the summer and autumn of 1917, during which &quot;XIV Corps achieved every objective it was given.&quot;
 He was awarded the rank of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 25 September 1917 and was redeployed with his corps to the Italian front in October 1917, after the Italians had suffered disastrously at the Battle of Caporetto. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1918, Cavan was appointed Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Forces in Italy on 10 March 1918, after his predecessor, General Herbert Plumer, had been recalled to the Western Front after the Germans had launched their Spring offensive.

After reverses on the Western Front in March and April 1918, Prime Minister Lloyd George and the War Cabinet had been keen to remove Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig as C-in-C of the BEF, but had been unable to think of a suitable successor. In July Cavan was summoned to London, supposedly to discuss the Italian Front but in reality, as Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey put it, &quot;to &#x27;vet&#x27; him with a view to his replacing Haig&quot; Hankey claimed to have dissuaded the Prime Minister by pointing to Cavan&#x27;s lack of ideas as to how to defeat the Austro-Hungarians. Haig&#x27;s victory at Amiens in August secured his position.

On the Italian Front Cavan, who in late June was promoted to the temporary rank of general, led the Tenth Army which struck a decisive blow at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the action that sounded the final death knell of the Austro-Hungarian Army towards the close of the war.

Following the end of the war the King of Italy awarded him the War Cross for Military Valor and made him a Commander, and subsequently a Grand Officer, of the Military Order of Savoy as well as appointing him a Grand Officer of the Order of St Maurice and St Lazarus. Cavan was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George for his contribution to operations in Italy, awarded the American Distinguished Service Medal and appointed to the Chinese Order of Wen-Hu (1st Class).

==Postwar==

His first appointment after the war was when he became lieutenant of the Tower of London on 22 March 1920. Appointed aide-de-camp general to the King on 1 October 1920, he succeeded General Lord Rawlinson as general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-in-C) of Aldershot Command on 2 November 1920 before being promoted to the substantive rank of general on 2 November 1921.

He was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 19 February 1922. He may have been chosen as a steady man, the antithesis of his predecessor, General Sir Henry Wilson, whose relations with the government had deteriorated, and who was in Wilson&#x27;s view more likely to agree to withdraw troops from Egypt and India. CIGS Cavan advised the Government on the implementation of the Geddes report, which advocated a large reduction in defence expenditure, and he officiated over a major reduction in the size of the British Army. Earl Cavan made a famous speech at the &#x27;Royal Academy Banquet&#x27; to his equals in government and fellow peers and royalty. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1926, he retired on 19 February 1926.

He was also colonel of the Irish Guards from 23 May 1925 and colonel of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment from 10 December 1928.

In May 1927, he accompanied the Duke and Duchess of York to Australia to open the Provisional Parliament House at Canberra, for which he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire on 8 July 1927. He became Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms on 23 July 1929 and was promoted to field marshal on 31 October 1932. He also took part in the procession for the funeral of King George V in January 1936 and commanded the troops at the procession for the coronation of King George VI on 12 May 1937.

During the Second World War he served as Commanding Officer of the Hertfordshire Local Defence Volunteers. He died at the London Clinic in Devonshire Place in London on 28 August 1946.

He was buried in the family plot at the churchyard in Ayot St Lawrence, where a seven-foot-tall red granite cross is his headstone. His is the churchyard&#x27;s only burial registered as Commonwealth war grave.

==Marriage and family==
He married on 1 August 1893 to Caroline Inez Crawley (1870–1920), daughter of George Baden Crawley and Eliza Inez Hulbert, at Digswell Church in Digswell, Hertfordshire. She predeceased her husband; they had no children.

He married, secondly, on 27 November 1922 to Lady Hester Joan Byng, daughter of Reverend Francis Byng, 5th Earl of Strafford and Emily Georgina Kerr, at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in North Audley Street, Mayfair, London. His second wife was the niece of his army colleague Field Marshal Byng, who was a younger half-brother of the 5th Earl of Strafford. Hester, Countess of Cavan, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1927. The couple had two daughters:

*Lady Elizabeth Mary Lambart (16 October 1924 – 8 December 2016), married in 1949 to Mark Frederic Kerr Longman, President of the Longman Group Ltd, had issue. She was in 1947 one of the eight bridesmaids in Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. Her granddaughter is Rose Cholmondeley, Marchioness of Cholmondeley.
*Lady Joanna Lambart

As he had no son, the 10th Earl was succeeded by his brother, Horace.

<text>A currency union (also known as monetary union) is an intergovernmental agreement that involves two or more states sharing the same currency. These states may not necessarily have any further integration (such as an economic and monetary union, which would have, in addition, a customs union and a single market).

There are three types of currency unions:
* &quot;Informal&quot; – unilateral adoption of a foreign currency.
* &quot;Formal&quot; – adoption of foreign currency by virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreement with the monetary authority, sometimes supplemented by issue of local currency in currency peg regime.
* &quot;Formal with common policy&quot; – establishment by multiple countries of a common monetary policy and monetary authority for their common currency.

The theory of the optimal currency area addresses the question of how to determine what geographical regions should share a currency in order to maximize economic efficiency.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Implementing a new currency in a country is always a controversial topic because it has both many advantages and disadvantages. New currency has different impacts on businesses and individuals, which creates more points of view on the usefulness of currency unions. As a consequence, governmental institutions often struggle when they try to implement a new currency, for example by entering a currency union.

===Advantages===
*A currency union helps its members strengthen their competitiveness on a global scale and eliminate the exchange rate risk.
*Transactions among member states can be processed faster and their costs decrease since fees to banks are lower.
*Prices are more transparent and so are easier to compare, which enables fair competition.
*The probability of a monetary crisis is lower. The more countries there are in the currency union, the more they are resistant to crisis.

===Disadvantages===
*The member states lose their sovereignty in monetary policy decisions. There is usually an institution (such as a central bank) that takes care of the monetary policymaking in the whole currency union.
*The risk of asymmetric &quot;shocks&quot; may occur. The criteria set by the currency union are never perfect, so a group of countries might be substantially worse off while the others are booming.
*Implementing a new currency causes high financial costs. Businesses and also single persons have to adapt to the new currency in their country, which includes costs for the businesses to prepare their management, employees, and they also need to inform their clients and process plenty of new data.
*Unlimited capital movement may cause moving most resources to the more productive regions at the expense of the less productive regions. The more productive regions tend to attract more capital in goods and services, which might avoid the less productive regions.

==Convergence and divergence==
Convergence in terms of macroeconomics means that countries have a similar economic behaviour (similar inflation rates and economic growth).
It is easier to form a currency union for countries with more convergence as these countries have the same or at least very similar goals. The European Monetary Union (EMU) is a contemporary model for forming currency unions. Membership in the EMU requires that countries follow a strictly defined set of criteria (the member states are required to have a specific rate of inflation, government deficit, government debt, long-term interest rates and exchange rate). Many other unions have adopted the view that convergence is necessary, so they now follow similar rules to aim the same direction.

Divergence is the exact opposite of convergence. Countries with different goals are very difficult to integrate in a single currency union. Their economic behaviour is completely different, which may lead to disagreements. Divergence is therefore not optimal for forming a currency union.

==History==
The first currency unions were established in the 19th century. The German Zollverein came into existence in 1834, and by 1866, it included most of the German states. The fragmented states of the German Confederation agreed on common policies to increase trade and political unity.

The Latin Monetary Union, comprising France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Greece, existed between 1865 and 1927, with coinage made of gold and silver. Coins of each country were legal tender and freely interchangeable across the area. The union&#x27;s success made other states join informally.

The Scandinavian Monetary Union, comprising Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, existed between 1873 and 1905 and used a currency based on gold. The system was dissolved by Sweden in 1924.

A currency union among the British colonies and protectorates in Southeast Asia, namely the Federation of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Singapore and Brunei was established in 1952. The Malaya and British Borneo dollar, the common currency for circulation was issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo from 1953 until 1967. Following the cessation of the common currency arrangement, Malaysia (the combination of Federation of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak), Singapore and Brunei began issuing their own currencies. Contemporarily, a currency reunion of these countries might still be feasible based on the findings of economic convergence.

==List of currency unions==
===Existing===

Note: Every customs and monetary union and economic and monetary union also has a currency union.

 is theoretically in a currency union with four blocs as the South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound and US dollar freely circulate. The US Dollar was, until 2016, official tender.

Additionally, the autonomous and dependent territories, such as some of the EU member state special territories, are sometimes treated as separate customs territory from their mainland state or have varying arrangements of formal or de facto customs union, common market and currency union (or combinations thereof) with the mainland and in regards to third countries through the trade pacts signed by the mainland state.

====Currency union in Europe====
The European currency union is a part of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU). EMU was formed during the second half of the 20th century after historic agreements, such as Treaty of Paris (1951), Maastricht Treaty (1992). In 2002, the euro, a single European currency, was adopted by 12 member states. Currently, the Eurozone has 20 member states. The other members of the European Union are required to adopt the euro as their currency (except for Denmark, which has been given the right to opt out), but there has not been a specific date set. The main independent institution responsible for stability of the euro is the European Central Bank (ECB). The Eurosystem groups together the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the Member States whose currency is the euro. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is made up of the ECB and the national central banks of all Member States of the European Union (EU), regardless of whether or not they have adopted the euro. The Governing Board consists of the Executive Committee of the ECB and the governors of individual national banks, and determines the monetary policy, as well as short-term monetary objectives, key interest rates and the extent of monetary reserves.

<text>Bendroflumethiazide, formerly bendrofluazide, trade name Aprinox, is a thiazide diuretic used to treat hypertension.

Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Water is lost as a result of more sodium reaching the collecting ducts. Bendroflumethiazide has a role in the treatment of mild heart failure although loop diuretics are better for reducing overload. The main use of bendroflumethiazide currently is in hypertension (part of the effect is due to vasodilation).
It was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse effects:

*feeling dizzy due to orthostatic hypotension
*dry mouth or feeling thirsty
*nausea
*stomach ache
*fatigue
*diarrhea or constipation
*joint pain due to gout

Rare adverse effects:

* thrombocytopenia
* agranulocytosis
* photosensitivity rash
* pancreatitis
* chronic kidney disease

=== Alcohol ===
Bendroflumethiazide is known to have an adverse interaction with alcohol. It is advised that those using this diuretic should abstain from alcohol consumption during use, as it is possible to experience a sudden drop in blood pressure, especially if standing up (an effect known as orthostatic hypotension).

=== Other considerations ===
Bendroflumethiazide should not be used by pregnant women, or women who have just given birth. Due to the nature of the medication, it is possible for it to pass into the breast milk and consequently to the child. It is also known that bendroflumethiazide suppresses the production of breast milk. Pregnant or lactating women with hypertension may need to discuss with their prescriber as to which alternative treatment may be more suitable. Bendroflumethiazide may also impair the user&#x27;s motor skills, therefore it is important to be aware of its effects and to take caution when operating machinery of driving.

<doc id="1179614" wikidata="Q1974968" url="?curid=1179614" title="Postal 2">
<text>Postal 2 is a 2003 first-person shooter video game developed by Running with Scissors and published by Whiptail Interactive. It is the sequel to the 1997 game &quot;Postal&quot; and was released for Microsoft Windows in April 2003, macOS in April 2004 and Linux in April 2005. &quot;Postal 2&quot;, as well as its predecessor, has received notoriety for its high levels of violence, stereotyping, and black comedy. Unlike the first installment, &quot;Postal 2&quot; is played from a first-person perspective, rather than an isometric perspective. The game is the first in the series to feature an open world.

Set in the fictional Arizona town of Paradise, &quot;Postal 2&quot; follows the life of &quot;The Postal Dude&quot;, who must carry out mundane tasks throughout an in-game week, with the player deciding how violently or passively he will react to various situations. The player navigates the game&#x27;s map to carry out his errands, with player choice having an effect on the setting.

The game received a mixed reception from critics upon its release and has gained a cult following. It has received several expansion packs, and in December 2003, a multiplayer expansion was released, titled &quot;Postal 2: Share the Pain&quot;. &quot;Postal 2&quot; remains continually updated, with a new expansion pack titled &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; released in April 2015.

The game received attention for its violent gameplay, and was responsible for multiple controversies. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Postal III&quot;, in December 2011, and another, &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;, in April 2022.

==Plot==
In &quot;Postal 2&quot;, the player takes on the role of the Postal Dude, a tall and thin red-headed man with a goatee, sunglasses, a black leather trench coat, and a T-shirt with a grey alien&#x27;s face printed on it. Postal Dude lives in a dilapidated caravan trailer on land behind a house in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply &quot;The Bitch&quot;. The game&#x27;s levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.

At the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as &quot;get milk&quot;, &quot;confess sins&quot;, and other seemingly mundane tasks. The objective of &quot;Postal 2&quot; is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way they wish, be it as peacefully and civilly as possible, or as violently and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game&#x27;s tagline: &quot;Remember, it&#x27;s only as violent as you are!&quot; The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.

Throughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the &quot;money line&quot;. During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous ATF agents, the National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical al-Qaeda terrorists (including Osama bin Laden), and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.

By Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the &quot;rocky road&quot; she asked for at the beginning of the game. &quot;Postal 2&quot; then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits.

==Gameplay==
One of the major concepts of &quot;Postal 2&quot; is that it is meant to be a &quot;living world&quot;, a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude—walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.

The town features many cars but they are all &quot;useless exploding props&quot;, according to Dude, and cannot be driven, although they can be blown up and sent flying into the air. In addition to cats and dogs, elephants are present; these animals can be shot or set on fire—or simply annoyed by the player walking into them—causing them to trumpet with rage and attack anyone within stomping distance. A peculiar feature is the ability to pick up cats as an inventory item. When used, The Postal Dude shoves the barrel of the currently equipped firearm into the cat&#x27;s rectum (cats can only be used while equipped with a shotgun or assault rifle) as a &quot;silencer&quot;. Every time a shot is fired, the cat meows in apparent agony, and the gunshot is muffled. After nine shots, the cat has run out of lives and it will fly from the end of the weapon. Most dogs have the ability to befriend the Dude if he feeds them a continual supply of dog biscuits or feeds them any other food (pizza, donuts, fast food). Once a canine&#x27;s loyalty has been earned, the dog will attack anyone who attacks the Dude, or alternatively, anyone whom the Dude attacks. Dogs will also chase and kill cats, and play fetch with the Dude&#x27;s inventory items and severed heads. There were also going to be cows included in the game, but they were left unimplemented. They did appear in &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; and the &quot;A Week in Paradise&quot; modification.

The game also features a cameo by Gary Coleman, acting as himself, who appears early on as the objective of one of the game&#x27;s tasks (travel to the local shopping mall to get Gary&#x27;s autograph). The player can choose to fight and kill Coleman or simply have the book signed peacefully (after enduring a long line-up). The Dude twice mistakes Coleman as having starred in &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, when he actually starred in &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. Regardless of the Dude&#x27;s actions, the police storm the building in an attempt to arrest Gary Coleman and a gunfight ensues which invariably results in Coleman&#x27;s apparent demise, with or without the player&#x27;s help. Later on in the game he can also be seen in the Police Station, when the player escapes from his cell he also frees everyone else—including Coleman, who can be seen running alongside Krotchy. Coleman apparently survives as he can be seen in the &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; expansion, bandaged up in the hospital (various evil Gary Coleman clones also serve as recurring enemies during Postal Dude&#x27;s constant hallucinations).

== Release ==
&quot;Postal 2&quot; was the first release by Whiptail Interactive, a publisher based in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The game was released to manufacturing in early April 2003 and shipped later that month in North America and Europe.

===Sales===

&quot;Postal 2&quot; became Linux Game Publishing&#x27;s fastest selling game in its first month, and contributed greatly to the continuing profitability of the company.

=== Expansions ===

====&quot;Share the Pain&quot;====
An updated edition of the game, entitled &quot;Postal 2: Share the Pain&quot;, included a multiplayer mode. The Macintosh and Linux versions of &quot;Postal 2&quot; shipped only as &quot;Postal 2: Share the Pain&quot;.

&quot;Share the Pain&quot; received an average score of 59 out of 100 based on 10 reviews on review aggregator website Metacritic, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

====&quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot;====

&quot;Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend&quot; is an expansion pack to &quot;Postal 2&quot; released by Running with Scissors. As a result of issues with publisher Whiptail Interactive, the expansion pack was originally released in Russia on August 1, 2004. In the USA and other countries the expansion pack was released on May 31, 2005 for Microsoft Windows, and September 28, 2005 for the Mac OS X and Linux versions. &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; expands the reaches of Paradise with new maps and missions, set on Saturday and Sunday, adds new weapons and foes, and raises the gore and violence to an even greater level. It was later included in both the &quot;Postal Fudge Pack&quot; and &quot;Postal X: 10th Anniversary&quot; compilations alongside &quot;Share the Pain&quot; and several fan produced mods, including &quot;A Week in Paradise&quot; which allows content from &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; to appear in the original game as well as allowing the expansions levels to be played as part of the original five-day campaign.

&quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; begins Saturday morning, with the Postal Dude waking up in the hospital, his head bandaged from a near-fatal gunshot wound. While the &quot;Postal 2&quot; ending leaves it ambiguous as to whether or not the Dude shot his wife or if his wife shot him, after he wakes up in the hospital he finds a card from his wife saying that she is leaving him. It was later revealed on the official website that the Dude shot himself due to his wife nagging him. The Dude&#x27;s ultimate goal is to recover his trailer and his dog Champ, and to this end, escapes from the hospital.

With the exception of the zombies that appear later in the game, it would appear the madness depicted at the end of Friday on the previous game has petered out. The Dude proceeds through several missions including assignments from his former employers, Running with Scissors, encounters with mad cow tourette zombies, as well as confrontations with terrorists and the military. Periodically, the Dude&#x27;s head wound causes him to enter a nether realm where he is attacked by Gary Coleman clones. Throughout the weekend, the Dude fights off hordes of zombies, Taliban and the National Guard until he finally faces a zombified Mike Jaret, an employee of Running with Scissors. Once the Dude destroys it, he leaves Paradise in his car with his dog and his trailer while Paradise explodes due to a massive nuclear warhead he &quot;borrowed&quot; to destroy a rival video game development and publishing company. The Dude&#x27;s last words of the game are &quot;I regret nothing&quot;.

While gameplay is similar to its parent &quot;Postal 2&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; is not as open-ended. The gameplay is more linear in design, with the player mostly forced to follow a certain path to complete the game—typical of most first-person shooter games. In addition, the player cannot play as a pacifist and is forced to kill animals and zombies in order to progress in the game. Unlike the main game, &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; also includes several &quot;boss monster&quot; encounters. All normal cats are also replaced with &quot;dervish cats&quot;, which spin in a manner similar to that of Looney Tunes Tasmanian Devil, attacking any nearby character when agitated. Dervish cats can also be collected and, in addition to muffling guns, can be thrown at NPCs to attack them.

&quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; received an average score of 45 out of 100 based on 4 reviews on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

==== &quot;Corkscrew Rules!&quot; ====
&quot;Postal 2: Corkscrew Rules!&quot; () is an official spin-off and expansion to &quot;Postal 2&quot;, developed by Avalon Style Entertainment, and released in 2005 by Akella. The plot concerns a man called Corkscrew (), who wakes up to find that his penis has somehow been amputated and goes on a mission to find it. The game was released only in Russia and Japan (under the title &quot;ポスタル2 ロシアより愛をこめて&quot; which translates to &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;). In 2017, an English version of the game was made available for free through the Steam Workshop.

====&quot;Paradise Lost&quot;====
&quot;Postal 2: Paradise Lost&quot; is a downloadable content pack for &quot;Postal 2&quot;, announced for Steam at E3 2014 with a teaser trailer. It was released on April 14, 2015.

&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; takes place 11 years after &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot;, the Postal Dude awakens from his 11-year radioactive-induced coma, the same amount of time between &quot;Postal 2&quot; release and the release of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, only to find his dog Champ is missing and has to go back to his home town of Paradise, which is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland. &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; also retcons &quot;Postal III&quot; as it was revealed that the events of that game were just a nightmare that the Postal Dude had during his coma.

Returning to Paradise, Dude allies with factions whom he had encountered in the previous games, including RWS, Al-Qaeda and the Kosher Mad Cow Tourettes Zombies. They attempt to help him find Champ. Near the end of the game, Dude has to go to Hell and battle Champ and his now-ex-wife, who has turned into a demon. Returning to Earth, he finds out that all the factions have gone to war and gives himself a choice: return to each faction and defeat its leader or leave the town. Eventually, he and Champ leave Paradise for the last time.

&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; includes various characters based on real people, including former child actor Gary Coleman, a returning character from &quot;Postal 2&quot; as well as Canadian actor Zack Ward who had previously depicted the Postal Dude in the 2007 &quot;Postal&quot; film. Former tech journalist and media personality Milo Yiannopoulos also had a less prominent role in the game as an NPC able to be found at the &#x27;Fire in the Hole&#x27; club from Thursday onwards. All three of these characters were played by their real life counterparts - Coleman&#x27;s dialogue was re-purposed from &quot;Postal 2&quot; due to his death five years earlier.

=== Compilations ===
On November 13, 2006, RWS Released a compilation of &quot;Postal - Classic and Uncut&quot;, &quot;Postal 2: Share the Pain&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot;, &quot;A Week in Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Eternal Damnation&quot;, along with extra content (Postal Babes and video clips from &quot;their cutting room floor&quot;) as the &quot;Postal Fudge Pack&quot; on a 3-way hybrid DVD for Windows, Linux, and the Mac. Recent copies of the Fudge Pack also include a Steam key for &quot;Postal&quot;, &quot;Postal 2 Complete&quot; and &quot;Postal III&quot;.

The &quot;Postal X: 10th Anniversary&quot; edition contains all the content from the &quot;Postal: Fudge Pack&quot; as well as introducing new content such as a cereal box, &quot;A Very Postal Christmas&quot;, &quot;Music to Go Postal By&quot;, and previews for both &quot;Postal III&quot; and the &quot;Postal&quot; film.

&quot;Postal 2 Complete&quot; is an online compilation containing &quot;Postal 2: Share the Pain&quot; and its expansion &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot; which is available from both the Desura platform for Linux, Mac and Windows and from GOG.com for Windows. The Linux version available from Desura was newly updated for its release on the digital distribution platform. The pack was made available through Steam on November 2, 2012, after successfully getting Greenlit by the community.

In November 2017, Running with Scissors released &quot;Postal XX: 20th Anniversary&quot;, a compilation of all &quot;Postal&quot; titles and the &quot;Postal&quot; film.

In March 2024, the Fudge Pack was reissued as a Blu-ray data disc, containing all &quot;Postal&quot; titles released up to that point, the &quot;Postal&quot; film and several bonuses.

==Mods==
=== &quot;Eternal Damnation&quot; ===
&quot;Postal 2: Eternal Damnation&quot; is a total conversion of &quot;Postal 2&quot; by Resurrection Studios, released as a free download in 2005 and in the &quot;Postal Fudge Pack&quot; a year later. The plot concerns a man called John Murray, who is in a mental asylum after having killed a man who tried to hurt his girlfriend. Weapons created for the mod are used in &quot;Postal 2 Complete&quot;. Character Murray is also seen in &quot;Postal 2: Paradise Lost&quot; at the asylum location as an Easter egg.

==Controversies==

In 2004, the Office of Film and Literature Classification banned &quot;Postal 2&quot; in New Zealand, citing high levels of violent content and animal violence. Distribution or purchase for personal use is a criminal offense, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $50,000. In Australia, the game was banned by the Australian Classification Board in October 2005, but the ban was quietly lifted in October 2013. In Sweden, the Chancellor of Justice took the local distributor of the game to court. He was prosecuted with &quot;illegal depiction of violence&quot;, a crime falling under the Swedish freedom-of-speech act. The court dismissed the case on December 12, 2006. In May 2016, the game was removed from the German version of Steam because it is on the list of media harmful to young people which means that it may only be offered and sold to adults after age verification (Steam does not offer age verification that is valid under German law).

Regarding his views on the subject, Linux and Macintosh developer Ryan C. Gordon, who ported the game to those platforms, stated that he feels that the game holds a mirror to the worst aspects of modern society, saying in an interview that the game is a &quot;brilliant caricature of our mangled, disconnected, fast-food society, disguised as a collection of dirty jokes and ultraviolence.&quot; Michael Simms, founder of Linux Game Publishing, also at one point commented on the matter, stating that &quot;although I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the gameplay in &quot;Postal 2&quot;, I loved the message that the company was trying to put out. Because you can play &quot;Postal 2&quot; in the most violent and graphic way, but you can also play it without hurting a single person. I don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s played it like that, but I like that the people who made &quot;Postal&quot; are saying you can get through this game without any violence.&quot;

In January 2008, three nineteen-year-olds were arrested following a three-week-long arson and theft spree in Gaston County, North Carolina. Police claimed that the spree was inspired by actions that could be carried out in &quot;Postal 2&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Postal 2&quot; received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Some of the game&#x27;s better reviews came from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot;. On the other end of the spectrum, &quot;GMR&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (&quot;CGW&quot;) both gave &quot;Postal 2&quot; scores of zero, with &quot;CGW&quot; deriding &quot;Postal 2&quot; as &quot;the worst product ever foisted upon consumers.&quot; In response, negative quotes from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;&#x27;s review ended up being proudly displayed on the box art of the &quot;Postal Fudge Pack&quot;. CNN journalist Marc Saltzman wrote that the game was &quot;more offensive than fun&quot; and concluded that &quot;it simply goes too far, too often, and offers little else.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s loading times, graphics and gameplay, and the gore was called &quot;surprisingly subdued&quot; in comparison to contemporary games like &quot;Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix&quot;. In a middling review for &quot;IGN&quot;, author Ivan Sulic disliked the game&#x27;s crude and childish humour, and dismissed the setting of Paradise as &quot;bland&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; similarly attacked the game for being immature. Ivan Deez from &quot;IGN&quot; says that Postal Dude has a &quot;sick mind&quot;, when referring to the source of some of the errands he has to complete. Macdonald and Rocha from Canada.com describe Postal Dude as a man whose &quot;raison d&#x27;être was to eliminate anyone - man, woman and child - with a dizzying arsenal of weapons&quot;, but at the same time as &quot;a misunderstood and ostracized man who takes his revenge on the world with a killing spree.&quot;

==In other media==
Scenes of the game can be seen in the music video of the Black Eyed Peas single &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; where children were shown playing the game. Running with Scissors stated in 2021 that they were paid for the use of the game&#x27;s footage.

==Film adaptation==

Although acknowledged as an adaptation of the first &quot;Postal&quot; game, the 2007 film adaptation of the same title directed by Uwe Boll borrows many elements from &quot;Postal 2&quot;, including the Krotchy doll, the trailer park, the cat silencer, The Lucky Ganesh convenience store, the terrorists, and Uncle Dave and his compound, among others. Gary Coleman was not involved in this film; instead Verne Troyer, appearing as himself, fulfilled Coleman&#x27;s function in the movie.

In 2013, Boll announced the second &quot;Postal&quot; film. In August 2013, Boll announced he was funding production of &quot;Postal 2&quot; through Kickstarter, but the project was cancelled in October 2013.

<text>The Ferrari 348 (Type F119) is a mid-engine V8-powered 2-seat sports car produced by Italian automaker Ferrari, replacing the 328 in 1989 and remaining in production until 1995, when it was replaced by the F355. It was the final V8 model developed under the direction of Enzo Ferrari before his death, commissioned to production posthumously.

==Variants==
===348 TB, TS===

The 348, badged 348 TB for the coupé (&quot;Trasversale Berlinetta&quot;) and 348 TS for the targa (&quot;Trasversale Spider&quot;), featured a naturally aspirated 3.4-litre version of the quad-cam, four-valve-per-cylinder V8 engine. As with its predecessors, the model number was derived from this configuration, with the first two digits being the displacement of the engine and the third being the number of cylinders. The engine, which had a power output of , was mounted longitudinally and coupled to a transverse manual gearbox. This marked the first street Ferrari application of the transverse gearbox design, originally developed for the Ferrari 312T F1 car. The &quot;t&quot; in the model tb and ts designations refers to the transverse position of the gearbox, which Ferrari sought to highlight for the model range, celebrating this technical lineage. This was the also the first time Ferrari featured a mid engine longitudinal V8 in one of its standard road cars, after the 288 GTO. Overall, 2,894 examples of the 348 TB and 4,228 of the 348 TS were produced.
The 348&#x27;s styling differed from previous models with straked side air intakes and rectangular taillights resembling the Testarossa, stylistic themes reminiscent of the F40, the world&#x27;s fastest production car at the time, and other prestigious Ferrari models of the past. The model was also the final design overseen by chief stylist Leonardo Fioravanti, known for such designs as the F40, Daytona, 512 Berlinetta Boxer, 288 GTO, P5, P6 and others. The F355 that succeeded the 348 returned to the styling cues of the 328 with round tail lights and rounded side air scoops.

The 348 was fitted with dual-computer engine management using twin Bosch Motronic ECUs, double-redundant anti-lock brakes, and self-diagnosing air conditioning and heating systems. In 1990, the Bosch Motronic engine management system was updated from the 2.5 to the 2.7 version. Later versions of the 348 (1993 and beyond) have Japanese starter motors and Nippondenso power generators to improve reliability, as well as the battery located within the front left fender for better weight distribution.

All 348s have OBD-I engine management systems, though European and general market variants do not come with the self-test push button installed, which is needed to activate this troubleshooting feature.

Similar to the Testarossa but departing from the 512 BB and 308/328, the oil and coolant radiators were relocated from the nose to the sides, widening the side of the car substantially, but making the cabin much easier to cool since hoses routing warm water no longer ran underneath the cabin as in the older front-radiator cars. This also had the side effect of making the doors very wide.

The 348 was equipped with a dry sump oil system to prevent oil starvation at high speeds and during hard cornering. The oil level could only be accurately checked on the dipstick when the engine was running due to this setup. The 348 was fitted with adjustable ride-height suspension and a removable rear sub-frame to speed up the removal of the engine for maintenance.

===348 Serie Speciale===
Between 1992 and 1993, Ferrari made 100 limited edition units of the 348 Serie Speciale of its tb and ts versions. It was only made for the US market.

The main technical modifications consisted in a revised engine which produced at 7,200  rpm, a wider rear track (50mm), a free-flow exhaust system, a shorter ratio final drive and Pirelli P Zero tyres. Ferrari indicated a 0–97  km/h acceleration time of 5.3 seconds and a standing ¼ mile of 13.75 seconds.

Several modifications were made to the exterior as well: new front spoiler to optimize aerodynamics similar to the F40, new front grille with the chrome prancing horse, bumpers and rocker panels in body colour, engine cover in body colour, modified taillight assembly and new rear grille with the chrome prancing horse.

The cars were offered with F40 style sport seats in Connolly leather with the regular seats included as an option. The door panels were also modified and made of leather. Each car was numbered (1 to 100), with a 348 Serie Speciale plaque on the passenger&#x27;s side door-post.

===348 Challenge===
The Ferrari Challenge was initiated by Ferrari Club Nederland founder and President Hans Hugenholtz and designated for the Ferrari 348; the series debuted in 1993 and included the Italian and European series. The engine used in the participating cars was similar to the road going GT models introduced in the same year with the only noticeable changes being the slick tyres, new body kit, better brake-pads, roll-bar, smaller battery in a different position and seat belts. In 1994 the G-spec engined cars had to be modified with the H-spec cylinder heads and injection system. The cars were mostly modified by dealers by installing factory supplied Challenge kits. The car&#x27;s final season was in 1995 and was replaced subsequently by the F355 Challenge.


===348 GTB, GTS, Spider===
In late 1993, the 348 was revised, featuring subtle styling changes (front grille, rear chrome Cavallino and removable seat cushions) and more power, this time and (Europe) from the same 3.4-litre engine, with an improved version of the Bosch Motronic 2.7 Engine Management System and a new exhaust system (single muffler).

The revised cars are called 348 GTB (252 made) and GTS (137 made) and were presented to the public as the 348 GT versions, equipped with the F119H engine (as opposed to the original F119D and US F119G). The F119H engine had an increased 10.8:1 compression ratio as compared to the F119D &amp; F119G&#x27;s 10.4:1 compression ratio, taller intake plenums, a larger intake compensation valve, fuel pressure raised from 3.4 bar to 3.8 bar, and different camshaft timing.

For these models, both the engine cover and lower body skirts were body-coloured instead of black, and the rear track was one inch wider due to the mounting area, on the inside, of the rear wheels being thicker. The suspension geometry was revised which greatly enhanced its handling, ride and body control. The fuel tank was made smaller in order to reduce overall weight and provide space to improve chassis rigidity; it now held .

A convertible variant called the Spider was introduced in 1993 and was Ferrari&#x27;s first series production convertible model since the Daytona Spider. Visual changes for the spider included body coloured lower cladding pieces, a specially designed engine cover and a manual folding soft top. The rear track was increased by compared to the 348 tb. The Spider used the same engine as the 348 GT models and hence benefitted from the increased power output. A new transverse mounted gearbox with modified gear ratios was installed to ensure better acceleration times and shift response.

===348 GT Competizione===
In 1993, Ferrari presented a light weight 348 GT Competizione variant as a homologation version for competing in the GT Championship. Safety equipment such as a tool kit was carried over from the 348 Challenge. The braking system was derived from the F40 Evoluzione model. The cars also had modified racing suspension and exhaust system. The engine had a power output of at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm, consistent to standard late 348 production with the F119H engine. Only 50 were made, including 8 Right Hand Drive models. Special features included a specially trimmed steering wheel indicating the number sequence in the production of the 50 cars, 5-spoke 18-inch Speedline competizione wheels and cloth trim seats with kevlar structure for weight reduction. Aiding further in the weight reduction was the carbon kevlar composite material used for the front and rear bumpers as well as the doors and a light weight polycarbonate rear window. Additional interior trim pieces such as door sills featured carbon kevlar and creature comforts such as air conditioning and sound proofing materials were removed. These changes resulted in a dry weight of . The final drive in the gear box was changed to 25/27 ratio for improved performance.

==Custom made specials==

===Zagato Elaborazione===
Between 1991 and 1992, Italian coach builder Zagato announced the Zagato Elaborazione package for the Ferrari 348 TB. The changes were all cosmetic and the engine and other mechanical components remained identical to the donor car.

At the front of the car a new bumper removed the original&#x27;s fake central grille and also replaced the Ferrari &quot;prancing horse&quot; emblem. The side intake cooling ducts were enlarged with the strakes removed and the engine cover was replaced with a glass engine cover showing off the V8 engine. A new round triple tail-light arrangement and an electronically controlled rear spoiler were added. A &quot;double bubble&quot; roof replaced the original, the idea being that Zagato could lower the roofline of a car, but retain enough headroom for each occupant. Other modifications included custom OZ Racing alloy wheels, external fuel filler caps and a completely reworked interior including a three-inch rear view screen and suede upholstery. Zagato initially announced a production run of 22 examples, but only 10 cars were made.

===348 Barchetta Competizione===
The Ferrari 348 Barchetta Competizione is a one-off special created for car collector Guy Audebert from his crashed Ferrari 348. The car, which has a true open top barchetta body style features heavily modified body work that includes a deeper chin spoiler, removal of the pop-up headlamps with the headlamps integrated in the fog light assembly, quick release bonnet, minimalist racing interior; featuring a detachable steering wheel, Sparco racing bucket seats with six-point harness and a roll bar for the driver&#x27;s safety, a large air scoop reminiscent to that used in Ferrari F1 cars, racing wing mirrors, replacement of the straked side air intakes with larger air intakes along with two additional vents, tail lights from the Ferrari 328, perforated rear grille, 18-inch BBS racing alloy wheels and a large rear wing inspired by the Ferrari F40 LM. Details of the coach builder that carried out this conversion, the materials used for the body work and the car&#x27;s technical specifications remain unknown due to the car being mostly kept private but the weight was revealed to be .

==Motorsports==
In 1991, 348 chassis number 82881 was delivered to Ecurie Francorchamps for the purposes of evaluating the 348&#x27;s suitability for competition use, and its development set the stage for the 348 GT Competizione production models to come near the end of the model run. Outfitted with composite doors, polycarbonate competition windows, and experimental exterior and underbody aerodynamic treatments, the development mule was designated as 348 tb/f, with the f designating the car&#x27;s creator, Francorchamps, and weighed a total of 1,165 kg (2,569 lbs). The car was frequently run at Spa Ferrari race events, but did not campaign formally within any major series.

For 1993, Michelotto, then known as Ferrari&#x27;s unofficial race preparation specialist based upon their work in developing the 288 GTO Evoluzione, F40 LM, and 333SP, was commissioned to prepare 11 examples of the 348 CSAI-GT model for competition in such prestigious events as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Daytona races. Sold with the intention of being campaigned by privateer teams, only 2 of the cars ever saw true competition use, with the remaining 9 disappearing into private collections. Italian race team Jolly Club campaigned one of the 348s alongside their Michelotto-prepared F40 LM, achieving significant success in the Campionato Italiano Supercar GT series, with the 348 winning sequential outright titles in 1993 and 1994, along with 3 category titles.

Michelotto built a further 2 cars in 1994, designated as 348 GTC-LM for competition within the GT2 class, campaigned by Team Repsol and Ferrari Club Italia. Team Repsol placed 4th in the GT2 class for the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans, following a trio of Porsche 911 GTs, and 11th overall. The 348 GTC-LMs also placed 2nd and 6th at Vallelunga 6hr and 4hr races, and 5th at Spa 4 hours for the season, along with another Michelotto 348 taking 7th in the GT2 class for the Daytona 24 hours.

==Other uses==
===Use as a Test Mule===
Two Ferrari 348s were used as two of the three test mules for the Ferrari Enzo namely M1 and M3 respectively. Details about the M1 remain unknown but some images surfaced online show that it was painted black and had stretched bodywork while the M3 featured heavily modified bodywork to accommodate the V12 engine and gearbox which were intended to be used in the production car along with many components from its successors, the F355 and the F430 respectively. The engine in the test mule produced , more than that of the production car. The car was not kept by Ferrari and was auctioned off in 2005 to a private collector at a price of €190,000; making its presence known to the public. The car was famous as &quot;the Frankenstein Ferrari&quot; due to it being a by-product of many Ferrari models. Due to this fact and a lack of model name and safety features, it was deemed not road-legal.

==Reception==

The Ferrari 348 made its debut in September 1989 at the Frankfurt Auto Show to positive reviews, cited as &quot;Best in Show&quot; by Road &amp; Track and AutoWeek coverage. In a later 1991 comparison against the NSX, Road &amp; Track inquired, “Has Honda bettered Ferrari?” The magazine concluded the Ferrari 348 was “the better exotic” and would later name it “one of the ten best cars in the world.” Auto journalists described the 348 as, &quot;something quite special,&quot; and the engine being the formative element in defining the car&#x27;s character, rising in an &quot;operatic crescendo,&quot; having the &quot;power to raise goose bumps as Pavarotti climbing to that note in Nessun Dorma.&quot;

Gavin Green reviewed the 348 against contemporaries in Car Magazine, Oct 1990: “There is nothing like it. It communicates so richly, involves you so completely. And, when you have finished driving it – cocooned in that exquisite cockpit – you can get out and feast your eyes on one of the loveliest cars ever designed.”

LA Times staff writer Paul Dean described the car in July 1990: “Ferrari builds motor cars in much the same way Claude Monet painted landscapes—not to please the populace, but more to satisfy self, a technique and a coterie,” with the 348 as a “better looking, stronger, faster” successor to the “enormously successful” 308/328 series, and “thoroughly irresistible.” Revising the longitudinal V8 layout in the way of the 288 GTO and F40, with a dry sump and transversely mounted “new gearbox and transmission (actually a carry-over from a Ferrari Formula 1 racing car),” the center of gravity is lower “by about 2 inches. Ergo flatter handling, and better steering response.”

Autocar Magazine featured a comparison of the 348tb, Honda NSX, Porsche 911 Turbo, and Lotus Esprit in the July 1993 article, “Lord of the Fliers,” by Stephen Sutcliffe. Through the road test that extended from Paris to Le Mans, the 348 was lauded for its styling and presence, “Crawling out of Paris in the thick of the densest French traffic jam any of us can ever recall, three things about our convoy were already becoming apparent. The First – how much more attention and affection the French public had in reserve for the Ferrari – was perhaps predictable, especially since the 348 had already blown the others into the water at Dover when it came to impressing the locals. Even so, the crowds that gathered like bees to honey wherever and whenever we parked it, and the comparative lack of enthusiasm for the other three, still came as something of a shock.” On the Le Mans race circuit, the 348s control and steering garnered praise over the NSX, “It&#x27;s the Honda&#x27;s body control and its meaty yet beautifully positive steering that allows it to feel so natural through the Esses of Le Mans; both seem peerless. Until you try the Ferrari. In the 348 you&#x27;ve got the same degree of body control, the same iron tautness through the corners, but the steering – lighter than the Honda&#x27;s but with much more feedback – lifts it clear of even the mighty NSX at La Sarthe.” Critique found the 348 difficult in traffic due to heavy steering and controls, though transformative on open road, “the further we traveled and the harder we drove in France, the more special, the more unique the Ferrari felt. We argued long and hard over which of the two made the best noise under full throttle, although no one disputed the fact that the NSX was more refined overall and had vastly superior gearchange. But ultimately this is as much the Honda&#x27;s problem as it is its strength. Because it is so well honed as an all-rounder, so easy to live with, it misses out on that last 10 per cent of pure, raw thoroughbred sports car appeal that makes the Ferrari such a deliciously rich experience. Partly it is the steering; the NSX&#x27;s is very good, the 348&#x27;s exquisite. And partly it is the extra sharpness of the Ferrari&#x27;s chassis, which is that crucial fraction more responsive to your inputs than not only the NSX but also any other supercar this side of £100,000 we can think of.”

Peter Dron of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; gave the car a negative review, criticising its acceleration by saying &quot;For some manufacturers, it might be hard to go to market when competitors are offering cars with demonstrably better performance for tens of thousands of dollars less. Ferrari, however, seems blessed with such cache that the numbers gleaned from mere fifth wheels don&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference. Take the Ferrari 348, for example. Its 0-60-mph time of about 6 seconds can be bested by such lesser-priced machinery as an L98 Corvette. Its slalom speed of a little over 63 mph is flat blown away by the humbly priced Nissan 300ZX Turbo.&quot; The engine note was criticised as well with the publication noting &quot;It doesn&#x27;t sound like a V-8; in fact, the noise it makes is more like a high-pitched turbine than anything else, the characteristic whine of the flat-plane crank. It doesn&#x27;t have the hard edge of Lamborghini&#x27;s V-8 (similar to the old Cosworth DFV) or the deep, throaty rumble of the high-performance domestic engines. It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant noise, but it won&#x27;t make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on edge. It&#x27;s simply an efficient device, to be used to the fullest.&quot; The exterior design, especially the fake front grille received a negative reception as well, with the publication remarking &quot;Least flattering is the full frontal view, and that dummy grille is a copout: If you don&#x27;t need a grille, why have one? An innovative aerodynamic approach would have made more sense. In the press handout (referring to the Testarossa-style side strakes) is the following remark: &#x27;On a Ferrari a technical requirement becomes a stylistic theme and nothing is simply there for decoration.&#x27; Oh, really?&quot;

In a 2015 retrospective, EVO Magazine compared the 458 Italia against its 308, 348, F355, 360 and F430 ancestors, where Henry Catchpole noted the primary highlight of the day being the 348&#x27;s steering, describing it as, “instantly obvious this car has some of the best steering, possibly the best, that I have ever sat behind.” He expounded on the car&#x27;s analogue character, describing the steering as, “coming alive in my hands. It literally starts wriggling around, talking excitedly about all the bumps in the road and sometimes making a bigger gesture as a camber attracts its attention. Despite the lack of assistance and the wheel’s relatively small diameter, it’s not heavy in any way, there’s just perfect weight and no slack to add to the constant communication.”

Some areas of critique focused around the long-established topic of Ferrari gearboxes, typically stiff and balky when cold. The 348 did not break from tradition in this area, requiring careful adjustment and lubricating considerations, as well as full warm up, and was found to perform best with quick and aggressive driving. &quot;It&#x27;s only when you allow the engine full voice that the 348&#x27;s drivetrain really works,&quot; mentioned Mike McCarthy of May 1994&#x27;s Wheels Magazine. &quot;Only then does this drivetrain achieve harmony,&quot; with the gear lever &quot;moving fast and fluidly,&quot; leaving &quot;no surprise to anyone who knows why Ferrari has the reputation it does,&quot; summarizing it to be, &quot;very much like what you imagine a Ferrari might be.&quot; Paul Dean described, “Gears are given up smoothly only when the moment, the engine, the clutch and shift are in concert. But finding that moment, being the conductor of a coordinated downshift, earning some respect from a benchmark machine that rises above the best of our abilities . . . ah, there&#x27;s the defiance but also the satisfaction of Ferrari.” Though lauded for its capability on a race circuit, oversteer characteristics at the limit in early 348s became a point of concern for the buying public due to the sensitive nature of the chassis setup, leading to updated mounting points in the rear combined with revised alignment specifications in later cars.

<text>Drag hunting or draghunting is a form of equestrian sport, where mounted riders hunt the trail of an artificially laid scent with hounds.

==Description==
Drag hunting is an equestrian sport where a field of mounted riders chase a pack of hounds who follow or &#x27;hunt&#x27; a trail of an artificial non-animal based scent. The primary difference between fox hunting and drag hunting is the hounds are trained to chase a prepared scent trail laid by a person dragging a material soaked in aniseed or another strong-smelling substance and not an animal-based scent mimicking a fox hunt, as in trail hunting.

A drag hunt course is set in a similar manner to a cross country course, following a predetermined route over jumps and obstacles. Because it is predetermined, the route can be tailored to suit the riding abilities of the field. The scent, or line, is usually laid 10 to 30 minutes prior to beginning of the drag hunt and there are usually three to four lines, of approximately each, laid for a day of drag hunting.

The drag hunting season usually starts in mid-October and continues through autumn and winter, finishing in the spring.

==History==
Drag hunting first became popular in the 19th century when Oxford and Cambridge universities both established packs of drag hounds.

The Pau Hunt, under the Mastership of Jasper Hall Livingston, documents a drag hunt on Saturday, November 26, 1847 between Pau, France and Gardères on the &quot;Route de Tarbes&quot; making a distance of 21 km (13 miles) in one hour.

Drag hunting soon became popular with the British Army, with the Household Cavalry establishing a pack in 1863 and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Royal Military Academy Woolwich both establishing packs in 1870. The motivation of the British Army&#x27;s interest in the sport was it was seen to provide excellent preparation for beginners and those who were about to enter the cavalry divisions.

As it does not involve the hunting of live animals, drag hunting remained legal in Great Britain after the passing of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and the Hunting Act 2004 (England and Wales).

==Related sports==
===Trail hunting===

A controversial alternative to hunting animals with hounds in Great Britain. A trail of animal urine (most commonly fox) is laid in advance of the &#x27;hunt&#x27;, and then tracked by the hound pack and a group of followers; on foot, horseback, or both.

===Hound trailing===

Similar to drag hunting, but in the form of a race; usually of around in length. Unlike other forms of hunting, the hounds are not followed by humans. 

===Clean boot hunting===

Clean boot hunting uses packs of bloodhounds to follow the natural trail of a human&#x27;s scent.

<text>Allerton Cemetery is a cemetery in Allerton, Liverpool, England. The cemetery, of , is one of the main burial sites for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and is Grade II listed. Springwood [[Crematorium]] is situated opposite the cemetery on Springwood Avenue. Purchase of the land for the cemetery was completed in October 1906, the Church of England section was consecrated by the Bishop of Liverpool on 24 September 1909, and the first burial in the cemetery took place on 29 December 1909. It is still in operation.

== Burials ==
In August 2003 the total number of burials was 74,109.

Burials by religion:
*Church of England 35,596
*General Nonconformist 18,024
*Roman Catholic 15,072
*Jewish 5,397
*Muslim 20

The cemetery contains graves of 415 Commonwealth services personnel from both World Wars.

Notable individuals buried here include:
*Cilla Black (died 2015), singer and television presenter.
*Julia Lennon (died 1958), mother of Beatle John Lennon.
*George Nurse (died 1945), decorated with the Victoria Cross in the Second Boer War.
*Private William Ratcliffe (died 1963), decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I.
*Sir Ken Dodd (died 2018), comedian.

As a result of investigations into the unauthorised retention of organs, starting on 5 August 2004 the bodies of 50 nameless babies stored for medical research at Liverpool hospitals were buried at Allerton Cemetery. Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital accounted for seven of the unnamed while the rest came from other hospitals.

== Full Earth Woodland Burials ==
Allerton Cemetery has a natural woodland burial area. This provides an alternative to the traditional type of burial area as it offers an area with mature trees and a variety of natural plants and grasses. Graves are excavated to accommodate one full earth burial, so as not to damage tree roots. An adjacent grave may be purchased in reserve where family members wish to be buried together.

Burials in this area can only take place in biodegradable coffins. The grave is marked with an inscribed marker with an inscription being chosen by family members. This is as opposed to traditional headstones, which are not permitted in the woodland area.

The principle behind the natural burial option, is to provide an environmentally friendly alternative. It is not intended to reuse the graves in future. Families can therefore be assured that at no point will the remains be disturbed.

<doc id="1179671" wikidata="Q760273" url="?curid=1179671" title="Nemeton">
<text>A nemeton (plural: nemeta) was a sacred space of ancient Celtic religion. Nemeta appear to have been primarily situated in natural areas, often sacred groves. However, other evidence suggests that the word implied a wider variety of ritual spaces, such as shrines and temples. Evidence for nemeta consists chiefly of inscriptions and toponymy or place-names, which occur all across the Celtic world. Toponyms related to the word &quot;nemeton&quot; occur as far west as Galicia in the Iberian peninsula, as far north as Scotland, and as far east as central Turkey. The word is related to the name of the Nemetes tribe living by the Rhine between the Palatinate and Lake Constance in what is now Germany, and their goddess Nemetona.

==Attestations in Latin==
The word nemeton is explained late in a gloss by Fortunatus : « loco nomine Vernemetis… quod quasi fanum ingens Gallica lingua refert. » (&quot;in a place called Vernemetis...which means like a &quot;fanum&quot; in the Gaulish language&quot;. From &quot;Ver-&quot; &quot;big, large&quot; + &quot;nemeto-&quot;) and in a Latinized form from the Roman form : « de sacris silvarum quae nimidas vocant. » (&quot;of the sacred woods which are called nimidas.&quot;)

==Contemporary description==
Pliny and Lucan wrote that druids did not meet in stone temples or other constructions, but in sacred groves of trees. In his &quot;Pharsalia&quot; Lucan described such a grove near Massilia in dramatic terms more designed to evoke horror among his Roman hearers than meant as proper natural history:

no bird nested in the nemeton, nor did any animal lurk nearby; the leaves constantly shivered though no breeze stirred. Altars stood in its midst, and the images of the gods. Every tree was stained with sacrificial blood. the very earth groaned, dead yews revived; unconsumed trees were surrounded with flame, and huge serpents twined round the oaks. The people feared to approach the grove, and even the priest would not walk there at midday or midnight lest he should then meet its divine guardian.

Tacitus, son in law of a Roman officer who was probably an eyewitness of the first Roman invasion of Anglesey, reports that when the Romans landed

On the shore stood the opposing army with its dense array of armed warriors, while between the ranks dashed women, in black attire like the Furies, with hair dishevelled, waving brands. All around, the Druids, lifting up their hands to heaven, and pouring forth dreadful imprecations, scared our soldiers by the unfamiliar sight, so that, as if their limbs were paralysed, they stood motionless, and exposed to wounds. Then urged by their general&#x27;s appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of frenzied women, they bore the standards onwards, smote down all resistance, and wrapped the foe in the flames of his own brands. A force was next set over the conquered, and their groves, devoted to inhuman superstitions, were destroyed. They deemed it indeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives and to consult their deities through human entrails.

==Examples==
Descriptions of such sites have been found all across the Celtic world. Attested examples include &quot;Nemetobriga&quot; near Ourense in northwestern Spain, &quot;Drunemeton&quot; in Galatia, at &quot;Medionemeton&quot; near the Antonine Wall in Scotland and in mid-Devon there are at least ten Nymet and Nymph place-names in the area surrounding the village of Bow.

* &quot;Mars Lucetius&quot; (&quot;Shining Mars&quot;) and Nemetona appear as a divine couple in Roman-era inscriptions. At the Romano-British site in Bath, a dedication was made to Mars Loucetius and Nemetona by a pilgrim who had come from the continental Treveri of Gallia Belgica to seek healing. A &quot;Mars Rigonemetis&quot; (&quot;Mars, King of the Sacred Grove&quot;) appears in the context of Roman Imperial cult in a dedication discovered at Nettleham (Lincolnshire) in 1961. He may have been a god belonging to the tribe of the Corieltauvi.
* A nemeton is in the Roman placename &quot;Vernemeton&quot; (now Willoughby-on-the-Wolds, Nottinghamshire), in Roman &quot;Aquae Arnemetiae&quot; (now Buxton, Derbyshire), and in the 1194 reference to Nametwihc, &quot;Sanctuary-Town,&quot; (Nantwich, Cheshire).
*In Scotland, &quot;nemeton&quot; place-names are quite frequent, as they are in Devon, where they appear in numerous place-names containing Nymet or Nympton, and have been identified with the name &quot;Nemetotatio&quot; in the Ravenna Cosmography near the site of modern-day North Tawton.
*A well known nemeton site is in the Névet forest near Locronan in Brittany (cf. Modern Breton &quot;neved&quot; &#x27;sanctuary&#x27;, Welsh &quot;nyfed&quot;). Gournay-sur-Aronde, in the Oise department of France, also houses the remains of a nemeton. Echoes of the word &quot;nemeton&quot; survive in many French place-names such as &quot;Novionemetum&quot; (&quot;noviios&quot; &#x27;new&#x27;) that evolved to Nonant, Nonant-le-Pin, etc., &quot;*Nemeto-pons&quot;, with Latin &quot;pons&quot; &#x27;bridge&#x27; : Nampont and &quot;Nemetodurum&quot; &#x27;door&#x27; or &#x27;forum of the temple&#x27; : Nanterre. In Paris, a case has been made for &quot;Namet&quot; in a line of doggerel of about 1270, as the ancient name for the &quot;Quartier du Temple&quot; on the Right Bank.
*In Ireland, there was a chapel Nemed at Armagh and another on Sliabh Fhuait.
*Nemetons also existed as far east as the Gaulish region of Galatia in Anatolia, where Strabo records the name of the meeting-place of the council of the Galatians as &quot;Drunemeton&quot;.

<doc id="1179675" wikidata="Q1156310" url="?curid=1179675" title="Kagoshima Airport">
<text>is an international airport located in Kirishima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, northeast of Kagoshima-Chūō Station in Kagoshima City. It is the second-busiest airport in Kyushu after Fukuoka Airport, serving 6.1 million passengers in 2018.

The airport covers 187.7 hectares (464 acres) and has one 3000m runway.

Japan Air Commuter, a regional affiliate of Japan Airlines, and New Japan Aviation have their headquarters at the airport.

Kagoshima Airport serves as the gateway to the Satsunan Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture. As a result, the route between Tokyo Haneda Airport and Kagoshima Airport is the fifth busiest route in Japan. It was ranked seventh in the world in Skytrax’s World&#x27;s Best Domestic Airports 2024.

==Overview ==
The airport is located 30km northeast of Kagoshima City. Although access by train is poor, access via expressway is good because it is close to the E3 Kyushu Expressway Mizobe Kagoshima Airport Interchange. 

==History==

The airport opened in 1972, replacing a former Imperial Japanese Navy airfield in the Kamoike area near the city center, which had served as the city&#x27;s main airport since 1957. The site of the former airport was re-developed as a &quot;new town&quot; with office buildings and high-density housing projects, and is now the site of the Kagoshima Prefecture government office, among other buildings.

The airport&#x27;s runway had an initial length of 2,500 m, which was extended to 3,000 m in 1980. An international terminal opened in 1982, and a cargo terminal opened in 1987.

Air Niugini, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines and Nauru Airlines provided international service to Kagoshima from the 1970s to the 1980s, and JAL operated a route to Singapore via Hong Kong and Bangkok during the 1980s. Kagoshima served as the destination of the final scheduled NAMC YS-11 flight in 2006.

==Facilities==

Kagoshima&#x27;s domestic terminal has nine gates. ANA and JAL both operate lounges in the terminal. The international terminal has a single gate.

<doc id="1179677" wikidata="Q2722920" url="?curid=1179677" title="All Parties Hurriyat Conference">
<text>All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) is an alliance of 26 political, social and religious organizations formed on 9 March 1993, as a united political front to raise the cause of Kashmiri independence in the Kashmir conflict. Mehmood Ahmed Saghar was the first convener of the APHC-PAK chapter when the alliance was established in 1993. The alliance has historically been viewed positively by Pakistan as it contests the claim of the Indian government over the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The organisation is split into two main factions, the Mirwaiz and Geelani factions. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is the founder and chairman of Mirwaiz faction and Masarat Alam Bhat is the interim chairman of Geelani faction, who succeeded Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the founder of the faction after his death.

==History==
The All Parties Hurriyat Conference was founded on 31 July 1993. On 27 December 1992, the 19-year-old Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who had taken over as chairman of J&amp;K Awami Action Committee (J&amp;KAAC) and become the head priest of Kashmir after the assassination of his father Mirwaiz Farooq, called a meeting of religious, social and political organisations at Mirwaiz Manzil leading to the creation of the formation the following year.

The APHC executive council had seven members from seven executive parties: Syed Ali Shah Geelani of Jamat-e-Islami, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq of Awami Action Committee, Sheikh Abdul Aziz of People’s League, Moulvi Mohammad Abbas Ansari of Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Prof Abdul Gani Bhat of Muslim Conference, Yasin Malik of JKLF, and Abdul Gani Lone of People’s Conference.

Now, the leadership of the some executive parties have changed with time like Mukhtar Ahmed Waza of people&#x27;s league, Masroor Abbas Ansari of Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and Bilal Ghani lone of people&#x27;s conference, renamed as JK peoples independent movement

==Ideology and role==
According to the Hurriyat, Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory and India&#x27;s control of it is not justified. It supports the Pakistani claim that Kashmir is the &quot;unfinished agenda of Partition&quot; and needs to be solved &quot;as per the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.&quot;

The APHC perceives itself to be the sole representative of the Kashmiri people.

The organisation&#x27;s primary role has been to project an image of counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and to mobilise public opinion against Indian security forces. The alliance has consistently followed up local allegations of security force excesses, and in several documented cases, real allegations about human violation by Indian security forces. For instance, the Haigam firing incident of 16 February 2001, was an assault on a peaceful gathering whereas, but later claimed in news reports and official clarifications, the army contingent fired upon the mob only when they were blocked and prevented from moving.

The APHC has also an observer&#x27;s status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). OIC has invited Mirwaiz Umar Farooq for its June 2005 Foreign Ministers Conference in Yemen.

==Split==
There are currently two factions of the Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani. The Mirwaiz-led group, also referred to as the &quot;moderate faction&quot; along with non-Hurriyat leaders like Yasin Malik undertook, between 2–16 June 2005, the first formal visit of Kashmiri separatists to Pakistani Kashmir and subsequently, though unsanctioned by Indian authorities, to Pakistan.

Internal fissures within the Hurriyat Conference culminated in a formal split on 7 September 2003, with at least 12 of its 26 constituents &quot;removing&quot; the then Chairman Maulana Mohammad Abbas Ansari &quot;replacing&quot; him with Masarat Alam as its interim chief. The dissenters reportedly met at the residence of hardliner and pro-Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and decided to depose Ansari and &quot;suspend&quot; the seven-member executive committee, the highest decision-making forum of the APHC. A five-member committee was formed to review the Hurriyat Constitution and suggest amendments to reverse what the dissenters perceived as &quot;autocratic&quot; decisions taken by the executive committee.

Following this, Geelani formed his own faction of the Hurriyat called All Party Hurriyat Conference (G) and took over its leadership in 2003. He was later appointed as its lifetime chairman. It consists of 24 parties. In 2004 he founded his own party named Tehreek-e-Hurriyat due to differences with the Jamaat-e-Islami. He was appointed as the party chairman in October 2004.

The Hurriyat Conference again split in 2014. The moderate Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq faced the split after four senior leaders raised a banner of revolt against the chairman and other members of the conglomerate.
Democratic Freedom Party president Shabir Ahmad Shah, National Front chairman Nayeem Ahmad Khan, Mahaz-e-Azadi chief Mohammad Azam Inqlabi and Islamic Political Party Mohommad Yousuf Naqash were up in arms against Mirwaiz after he dashed off a letter to the convener in Pakistan administered Kashmir, Mohommad Yousuf Naseem, asking him not to entertain the leaders who have left the conglomerate on their own.
The leader Shabir Shah and his lieutenant Nayeem Khan along with Shia leader Agha Hassan joined Hurriyat Conference (G) led by Syed Ali Geelani.

==Views on right to self-determination==
All JKLF factions support the right to self-determination as per UN Security Council Resolution 47. Hurriyat, led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Shabir Shah, Nayeem Khan &amp; Azam Inquilabi, demand the right to self-determination as per UN Security Council Resolution 47. 
Members of the Executive Council of the original APHC were:
* Peoples Conference: Abdul Ghani Lone
* Jamat-e-Islami: Syed Ali Shah Geelani
* Awami Action Committee: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq
* People&#x27;s League: Mukhtar Ahmed Waza
* Itehad-ul-Muslimeen: Mohammad Abbas Ansari
* Muslim Conference: Abdul Ghani Bhat
* JKLF: Yasin Malik

==Criticism and controversies==

===Relations with Pakistani ISI===
Sheikh Mustafa Kamal, a senior leader of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference and son of Sheikh Abdullah criticised Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani for working on &quot;dictations&quot; given by Pakistan. He accused Geelani of being &quot;a double agent&quot; on &quot;the payroll of Pakistan&#x27;s ISI&quot;.

Kamal said &quot;Geelani has tried to &#x27;ignite and incite&#x27; people by &#x27;hollow slogans and destructive emotionalism&#x27;, whenever even a Pakistani clerk comes to India and summons this ex-lawmaker(Geelani), he rushes to Delhi to take dictation about how to ensure that uncertainty prevails in the state.&quot;

Pakistan also openly supported Geelani and Hurriyat, and representatives have had several meetings with Hurriyat leaders. A three-member delegation from the Pakistan High Commission led by Abdul Basit met Geelani at his Malviya Nagar residence in March 2015. Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit assured Geelani of complete support conveying that the country&#x27;s stand on Kashmir remains unchanged despite the regime change in New Delhi. Basit also invited Geelani for a Pakistan Day function on 23 March. The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, ritually invites pro-separatist leadership of Jammu and Kashmir for the function every year.

Indian media vehicles reported that Geelani and Hurriyat are paying local unemployed young men to stage protests. According to them, arrested participants confessed being paid Rs 400($6–7) every Friday.
Police said the money is being raised locally by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani&#x27;s followers. Most of the money comes from fruit markets and saw mills, Pakistan-based LeT terrorists also participate in stone peltings, the police said.

===Elections boycott===
Geelani and Hurriyat appealed to the people of Kashmir to boycott the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections completely, arguing that: &quot;India has been holding elections in the Valley using the power of gun and so such an exercise is not legitimate.&quot; But despite repeated boycott appeals, the 2014 assembly election recorded record voter turnout of more than 65% which was the highest in 25 years of history and higher than normal voting percentages in other states of India.

While voter turnout in Jammu and Kashmir as a whole was high, it remained low in Kashmir, and in many thickly populated areas of Srinagar and Anantnag, it stayed considerably below the norm, reaching close to 20% in some of them. This trend continued and became much worse during the 2019 Lok Sabha election in JK, where Srinagar and Anantnag recorded voter turnout of 15.6% and 9.7% each respectively.

Member of the European Parliament Kosma Zlotowski welcomed the smooth conduct of the State Legislative Elections in the Jammu and Kashmir. Zlotowski&#x27;s office in its message said that: &quot;The high voter turnout figure proves that democracy is firmly rooted in India. The EU would like to congratulate India and its democratic system for conduct of fair elections, unmarred by violence, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir [...] The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces.&quot;

==Current members==
Current members of All Parties Hurriyat Conference include:
Hurriyat Conference has three factions: Hurriyat led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Hurriyat led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, and Hurriyat led by Shabir Shah, Azam Inquilabi &amp; Nayeem Khan. Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front is not part of these factions.

<text>Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (Dresden, 3 January 1823 – Hamburg, 6 May 1889) was a botanist and the foremost German orchidologist of the 19th century. His father Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach (author of &quot;Icones Florae Germanicae et Helveticae&quot;) was also a well-known botanist.

==Biography==
He started his study of orchids at the age of 18 and assisted his father in the writing of &quot;Icones&quot;. He became a Doctor in Botany with his work on the pollen of orchids (see ‘Selected Works’).

Soon after his graduation, Reichenbach was appointed to the post of extraordinary professor of botany at the Leipzig in 1855. He then became director of the botanical gardens at the Hamburg University (1863-1889).

At that time, thousands of newly discovered orchids were being sent back to Europe. He was responsible for identifying, describing, classifying. Reichenbach named and recorded many of these new discoveries. He probably was not the easiest of personalities, and used to boast about his many descriptions, some of which were superficial, leading to a great deal of taxonomic confusion.

H.G. Reichenbach became the world&#x27;s leading authority on orchids, after the death of his friend, the &#x27;father of orchidology&#x27; John Lindley in 1865. Reichenbach spoke English extremely well. He made many visits, sometimes lasting many weeks, to Kew and the herbarium of the British Museum, as well as visits to English professional and private growers of orchids. His last visit to England was in the autumn of 1887.

&quot;Orchid specimens from all over the world were sent to him for identification, and these, together with his copious notes and drawings, forms an immense herbarium which rivaled that of Lindley at Kew&quot; (Reinikka, &#x27;A history of the orchid&#x27;, p. 215).

His immense herbarium and library were bequeathed to the &#x27;Naturhistorisches Museum&#x27; in Vienna, Austria (instead, as expected, to the Kew Gardens), on the condition that it would not be consulted during the first 25 years after his death. Reichenbach probably acted this way out of resentment of the appointment of Robert Allen Rolfe, a self-taught orchid expert, as the top taxonomist at Kew. This resulted in a great number of double or multiple descriptions of orchid species, which had to be corrected afterwards.

After Reichenbach&#x27;s death, his work was continued by Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig (“Fritz”) Kraenzlin (1847-1934).

In 1886, Frederick Sander commissioned Henry George Moon (1857-1905), a pure colourist, to paint 192 watercolour plates of orchids with descriptions by Reichenbach (1888-1894). These monthly publications became known as the and are the richest reference sources on orchids ever produced.

<doc id="1179688" wikidata="Q1051993" url="?curid=1179688" title="Monimiaceae">
<text>The Monimiaceae is a family of flowering plants in the magnoliid order Laurales. It is closely related to the families Hernandiaceae and Lauraceae. It consists of shrubs, small trees, and a few lianas of the tropics and subtropics, mostly in the southern hemisphere. The largest center of diversity is New Guinea, with about 75 species. Lesser centres of diversity are Madagascar, Australia, and the neotropics. Africa has one species, &quot;Xymalos monospora&quot;, as does Southern Chile (&quot;Peumus boldus&quot;). Several species are distributed through Malesia and the southwest Pacific.

The Monimiaceae are underrepresented in herbaria and other plant collections. Variation within the family has not been understood, resulting in an unusual proportion of monospecific genera. As of 2010, these 11 genera were considered monospecific: &quot;Peumus, Xymalos, Kibaropsis, Austromatthaea, Hemmantia, Pendressia, Hennecartia, Macrotorus, Macropeplus, Grazielanthus,&quot; and &quot;Faika&quot;. &quot;Kairoa&quot; was thought to be monospecific until 2009.

The Monimiaceae include 24 genera with a total of about 217 known species. The largest genera and the number of their constituent species is: &quot;Tambourissa&quot; (50), &quot;Mollinedia&quot; (20-90), &quot;Kibara&quot; (43), &quot;Steganthera&quot; (17), &quot;Palmeria&quot; (14), and &quot;Hedycarya&quot; (11). The type genus, &quot;Monimia&quot;, is endemic to the Mascarenes.

The number of species in the Monimiaceae has been variously estimated from about 200 to about 270. Most of this difference results from uncertainty over species limits in the tropical American genus &quot;Mollinedia&quot;. Estimates of the number of species in &quot;Mollinedia&quot; have ranged from 20 to 90. Janet Russell Perkins and Ernest Friedrich Gilg described 71 species of &quot;Mollinedia&quot; in &quot;Das Pflanzenreich&quot; in 1901, but many authors today regard this as an example of overdescription.

The wood of &quot;Peumus boldus&quot; and &quot;Hedycarya arborescens&quot; is used locally, in Chile and New Zealand, respectively, but is of no commercial importance. Both of these species are grown in their native regions as ornamentals. An herbal tea is made from &quot;Peumus&quot;.

The phytochemistry of a few of the genera has been studied.

Fossil wood attributed to the Monimiaceae has been found in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and on James Ross Island, Antarctica. Both of these fossil sites are roughly 83 million years old, from the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period. Fossil leaves of the Monimiaceae are known from the Paleocene of King George Island of the South Shetland Islands, near the Antarctic Peninsula and from the Eocene of Patagonia.

Divergence of different groups within Monimiaceae was long believed to be explained by the separation of East Gondwana (India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Australia, Antarctica, and New Caledonia) from West Gondwana (Africa and South America), and by the later separation of Africa and South America. The family Monimiaceae was long considered to be one of the best examples of vicariance, but the dating of clades by molecular clock methods has shown that the presence of the Monimiaceae in Africa and South America can be explained only by long-distance dispersal. Antarctica had coastal forests as recently as the mid-Miocene, and these could have provided an intermediate phase in dispersal between Australia and South America.

== History ==
The family Monimiaceae was erected in 1809 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. He called it &quot;[the] order Monimieae&quot;, but the orders of that time were equivalent to what are now called families. He defined the family broadly, to include what are now called the Siparunaceae and Atherospermataceae, as well as the modern Monimiaceae. This circumscription of the family prevailed until the 1990s, but some, such as Robert Brown and John Lindley, recognized the Atherospermataceae as a separate family.

Jussieu used the now-obsolete genus names &quot;Ruizia&quot;, &quot;Ambora&quot;, &quot;Citrosma&quot;, and &quot;Pavonia&quot; (&quot;sensu&quot; Ruiz &amp; Pavón). These are now known as &quot;Peumus&quot;, &quot;Tambourissa&quot;, &quot;Siparuna&quot;, and &quot;Laurelia&quot;, respectively. Jussieu was apparently unaware that Antonio José Cavanilles had published the name &quot;Pavonia&quot; in 1786 for a genus in the Malvaceae. Later authors replaced the name &quot;Ruizia&quot; with &quot;Boldea&quot;, until it was eventually determined that &quot;Peumus&quot; is the correct name for this genus.

In 1855, Louis-René Tulasne wrote two landmark papers on the Monimiaceae. Using current names, the genera that he recognized were: &quot;Peumus, Monimia, Tambourissa, Hedycarya, Mollinedia, Kibara, Siparuna, Atherosperma, Laurelia,&quot; and &quot;Doryphora&quot;.

In 1898, Janet Russell Perkins began a series of articles on the Monimiaceae, but only two were ever completed. The second of these was mistitled as part III on its first page (compare to table of contents therein) and covers the genus &quot;Siparuna&quot;, which is now grouped with &quot;Glossocalyx&quot; in the family Siparunaceae.

The first in this series covers the tribe Mollinedieae, but begins with an extensive discussion of the family. Perkins defined the family very broadly, to include &quot;Amborella&quot;, &quot;Trimenia&quot;, and &quot;Piptocalyx&quot;. These are now regarded as basal angiosperms, and &quot;Piptocalyx&quot; is a segregate of &quot;Trimenia&quot;. Perkins also included the genus &quot;Conuleum&quot;, but it is now usually treated in &quot;Siparuna&quot; because it is monospecific and sister to &quot;Siparuna&quot;.

In this paper, Perkins named five new genera: &quot;Macropeplus, Macrotorus, Steganthera, Tetrasynandra,&quot; and &quot;Anthobembix&quot;. The genus &quot;Anthobembix&quot; consisted of two species that Perkins had transferred from &quot;Kibara&quot;. In 1942, these were transferred to &quot;Steganthera&quot;. The genus &quot;Lauterbachia&quot; was named by Perkins in a flora published in 1901.

A comprehensive treatment of the Monimiaceae was published by Perkins and Ernest Friedrich Gilg in &quot;Das Pflanzenreich&quot; in 1901. In the part of their family that is still in the Monimiaceae, 20 genera were recognized, including &quot;Anthobembix&quot;. They placed &quot;Conuleum&quot; in synonymy under &quot;Siparuna&quot; and added four genera to those listed by Perkins in 1898. The new genera were &quot;Xymalos, Wilkiea, Lauterbachia,&quot; and &quot;Chloropatane&quot;.

The genus &quot;Chloropatane&quot; had been described by H.G. Adolf Engler in 1899. It was based on a specimen that was eventually shown to be a species of &quot;Erythrococca&quot; (Euphorbiaceae), but it is too fragmentary to be more precisely identified.

The family was reviewed again by Lillian L. Money &quot;et al.&quot; in 1950.

The most recent monograph of the Monimiaceae was written by William Raymond Philipson in 1993 in a series entitled &quot;The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants&quot;. Philipson divided the Monimiaceae into six subfamilies: Glossocalycoideae, Siparunoideae, Atherospermatoideae, Monimioideae, Hortonioideae, and Mollinedioideae. The latter three constitute the Monimiaceae as defined in the APG III system, which was published in 2009. In these three subfamilies, Philipson recognized a total of 25 genera. He did not accept &quot;Anthobembix&quot;, but he did include the other 19 genera from the 1901 monograph by Perkins and Gilg. He also included six genera that had been published after Perkins and Gilg (1901): &quot;Decarydendron, Kibaropsis, Austromatthaea, Kairoa, Faika,&quot; and &quot;Parakibara&quot;. The latter three had been named by Philipson in the 1980s.

After Philipson&#x27;s treatment of the Monimiaceae, the genera &quot;Hemmantia&quot; and &quot;Endressia&quot; were published in 2007 in &quot;Flora of Australia&quot;. &quot;Grazielanthus&quot; was published in 2008 in &quot;Kew Bulletin&quot;. The name &quot;Endressia&quot; (&quot;sensu&quot; Whiffin) is now known to be illegitimate because Jaques Étienne Gay had published the name &quot;Endressia&quot; for a genus in the Apiaceae in 1832. &quot;Endressia&quot; is related to &quot;Angelica&quot; and &quot;Selinum&quot; in the tribe Selineae.

Molecular phylogenetic studies of the angiosperms and of Laurales had only sparsely sampled the Monimiaceae until 2010. In that year, and in 2014, phylogenies were produced that were based on much denser sampling. These have shown that the next revision of the family must make substantial changes to the genera.

== Classification ==
From the time that the family Monimiaceae was established by Jussieu in 1809, until it was monographed by Philipson in 1993, it was usually circumscribed to include three distinct groups in the Laurales, which are recognized in the APG III system as the separate families Siparunaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Monimiaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. The inclusion of &quot;Amborella&quot; and &quot;Trimenia&quot; was always doubtful and was rejected by many. Their exclusion from the Monimiaceae was well established by the time Philipson wrote his treatise on the family.

Beginning with the ground-breaking paper by Mark W. Chase and many coauthors in 1993, the cladistic analysis of DNA sequences has contributed much to the knowledge of angiosperm phylogeny. By the end of the 1990s, it was evident that the traditional circumscription of Monimiaceae was paraphyletic over the monotypic family Gomortegaceae, and possibly polyphyletic, as well, because the major part of it formed a clade with the Hernandiaceae and Lauraceae.

Among the Hernandiaceae, Monimiaceae, and Lauraceae, the question of which two are most closely related has been remarkably difficult to answer. Different studies have yielded different results, but none with strong statistical support. This is surprising, as the Hernandiaceae and Lauraceae are much closer to each other morphologically than either of them is to the Monimiaceae.

== Systematics ==
In 1993, Philipson divided the subfamily Mollinedioideae into three tribes: Hedycaryeae, Mollinedieae, and Hennecartieae. The Hennecartieae consisted of a single species: &quot;Hennecartia omphalandra&quot;. It is now known that &quot;Hennecartia&quot; is nested within the Mollinedieae and is sister to a clade consisting of the rest of the neotropical Monimiaceae. The family Mollinedieae is strongly supported as monophyletic if &quot;Hennecartia&quot; is included.

The monophyly of the Hedycaryeae is not supported or rejected by either of the recent molecular phylogenetic studies. One study resolved &quot;Xymalos&quot; as sister to the rest of the Mollinedioideae, but this result had only weak maximum likelihood bootstrap support.

In the next revision of the Monimiaceae, several genera will need to be recircumscribed or placed in synonymy with others. &quot;Tetrasynandra&quot; and &quot;Grazielanthus&quot; are embedded within &quot;Steganthera&quot; and &quot;Mollinedia&quot;, respectively. &quot;Kibaropsis&quot; forms a clade with &quot;Hedycarya arborea&quot;, the type species of &quot;Hedycarya&quot;. The monophyly of &quot;Levieria&quot; is questionable, but only one species has been sampled for DNA. &quot;Levieria acuminata&quot; is nested within &quot;Hedycarya&quot;. &quot;Wilkiea&quot;, meanwhile, is polyphyletic and should be divided into at least three genera. The type species, &quot;W. calyptrocalyx&quot; is now regarded as a synonym of &quot;Wilkiea huegeliana&quot;, and the latter is placed by some authors in synonymy with &quot;Wilkiea macrophylla&quot;.

<text>Beipiaosaurus is a genus of therizinosauroid theropod dinosaurs that lived in China during the Early Cretaceous in the Yixian Formation. The first remains were found in 1996 and formally described in 1999. Before the discovery of &quot;Yutyrannus&quot;, &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; were among the heaviest dinosaurs known from direct evidence to be feathered. &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; is known from three reported specimens. Numerous impressions of feather structures were preserved that allowed researchers to determine the feathering color which turned out to be brownish.

They were relatively small-sized therizinosaurs, measuring long and weighing about in contrast to the advanced and giant &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; or &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. The necks of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; were shorter than in most therizinosaurs, whose are characterized by elongated necks adapted for high-browsing. Also, their feet configuration differs from therizinosaurids, having a generic three-toed pes instead of four as seen in other members.

The exact classification of therizinosaurs had in the past been hotly debated, since their prosauropod-like teeth and body structure indicate that they were generally herbivorous, unlike typical theropods. &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, being considered to be a primitive therizinosauroid, has features which suggest that all therizinosauroids, including the more derived Therizinosauridae, to be coelurosaurian theropods, not sauropodomorph or ornithischian relatives as once believed.

==History of discovery==
In 1996, a farmer, Li Yinxian discovered a partial skeleton of a theropod dinosaur near the village of Sihetun. The following year, it was confirmed to have come from the lower beds of the Yixian Formation and represented a single individual. On May 27, 1999, the discovery was announced on the famous journal &quot;Nature&quot; and the type species &quot;Beipiaosaurus inexpectus&quot; named and described by Xu Xing, Tang Zhilu and Wang Xiaolin. The generic name &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; translates as &quot;Beipiao lizard&quot; after Beipiao, a city in China near the location of its discovery. &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; is known from a single species, &quot;B. inexpectus&quot;, the specific name, meaning &quot;unexpected&quot; in Latin, referring to the &quot;surprising features in these animals&quot;.

The holotype (type specimen) of &quot;Beipiaosaurus inexpectus&quot;, IVPP V11559, was recovered in the Jianshangou Beds of the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, China. The specimen was collected in sediment deposited during the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, approximately 125 million years ago. It is housed in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, in Beijing, China. It consists of a partial, sub-adult, skeleton that is largely disarticulated. A significant number of fossilized bones were recovered, including: cranial fragments, a mandible, teeth, three cervical vertebrae, four dorsal vertebrae, four dorsal ribs, two sacral vertebrae, twenty-five caudal vertebrae with a pygostyle, three chevrons, an incomplete furcula and scapula, both coracoids, both forelimbs, both ilia, an incomplete pubis, an incomplete ischium, a femur, both tibiae (one incomplete), an incomplete fibula, the astragalus and calcaneum, several tarsals, metatarsals, manual and pedal unguals, and skin impressions of the primitive plumage. The pelvic girdle and caudal vertebrae were discovered during a re-excavation of the fossil quarry where the first elements of the holotype were found. These rediscovered elements helped to complete the holotype specimen.

A second specimen, STM 31-1, a partial skeleton, was described by Xu et al. 2009, which preserves a significant covering of unique, elongated feathers. This specimen consisted of a complete skull, a sclerotic ring, the mandible, the atlas and axis bones, nine additional cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, seventeen cervical ribs, twelve dorsal ribs, both scapulae and coracoids, one complete humerus and proximal humerus, one complete radius and distal radius, one complete ulna and distal ulna, carpals, and some metacarpals. The rear of the skull of this specimen was badly crushed. Li et al. 2014 mentioned a third specimen labelled under the number BMNHC PH000911. This specimen hails from the Sihetun locality at the Beipiao County in Liaoning Province and compromises a partial individual preserving the skull (badly crushed), most of the vertebral column, both arms and other postcrania. Traces of feather integument were extensively found around the neck area.

==Description==

&quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; was a small therizinosaur, with the largest specimen having an estimated length of . In 2013, Lindsay E. Zanno and Peter Makovicky estimated its body mass at around , based on the length of its femur. In 2024, Gregory S. Paul estimated &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;&#x27; body length at , and its body mass at around More advanced therizinosaurids have four functional toes, but the feet of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; still have reduced inner toes, showing that the derived therizinosaurid condition may have evolved from a three-toed therizinosauroid ancestor. The head was large relative to other therizinosaurs, with the lower jaw measuring about same length as the femur. The neck appears to be shorter compared to other therizinosaurs. In 2003 the pygostyle, consisting of the fused five last vertebrae of the tail, was described in greater detail, suggesting that the original function of the pygostyle was not linked with pennaceous feathers.

=== Skull and dentition ===
The skull of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; was fairly large, proportionally, compared to other therizinosaurs. The premaxilla and maxilla are not known, and only one nasal is preserved, though it is not clear which side of the skull it belonged to. The transverse (side-to-side) arching of the nasal observed in other theropods was absent in &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, though this may be taphonomic. The posterior (rear) half of the right frontal is preserved. The bone overall is inferred to have been subtriangular, as in other therizinosaurs. Unlike other therizinosaurs, the posterior portion is considerably broader than what is preserved of the anterior (front) portion; it is three times the width, as opposed to twice the width. It is flattened, as in &quot;Falcarius&quot; and &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;, as opposed to the domed shape seen in &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and most coelurosaurs. The parietals are both preserved. They were large and flat, and were separate bones, sutured along the midline; this is contrary to the condition in other therizinosaurs, like &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;, where they were fused. The postorbital differs from that of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; in having a proportionally shorter frontal process a longer accessory medial (midline) process, and a more dorsal (higher) rugose area. The posterior half of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;&#x27; skull (the braincase) is represented exclusively by the and bones.

&quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;&#x27; mandibles (lower jaws) are represented by a nearly complete right dentary, lacking the anterior and posterodorsal (top-rear) portions, the part of the left surangular, and part of the left angular. The dentary is around sixty-five percent as long as the femur, larger than that of any other therizinosaur. It is long and slender, subtriangular when seen from the side. At its lowest, the dentary is , whereas at its highest, it is . This size ratio is greater than that of most other therizinosaurs. The Meckelian groove is deep, narrow, and anterior, as opposed to the more dorsal one of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;. The left surangular forms most of the lateral surface of the mandible&#x27;s posterior half, and bears two foramina on its lateral surface. The angular was very thin transversely, and formed the posteroventral (rear-bottom) and ventral (bottom) borders of the external mandibular fenestra.

Based on the amount of sockets in the dentary&#x27;s alveolar margin, &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; likely had more than thirty-seven teeth in each dentary, similar to &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; and &quot;Eshanosaurus&quot;, but higher than most other therizinosaurs. The preserved teeth are fairly homodont (even in size and shape), and folidont (leaf-shaped with prominent denticles), though it is not clear whether those near the front of the dentary were enlarged and conidont (conical and with reduced denticles), as in other therizinosaurs. There denticles preserved are similar in size to those of &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;, with the carina of each crown bearing three denticles per millimetre. The tooth roots are slightly compressed mediolaterally. Resorption pits, containing replacement teeth, are associated with the medial surfaces of some functional teeth&#x27;s roots, similar to &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot;.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===

Four of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;&#x27; cervical (neck) vertebrae are preserved, all of them incompletely. Since they are not elongated, they likely belong to the posterior portion of the cervical series. The centra of the cervical vertebrae were , meaning that they were concave on either end. Based on &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; and STM 31-1, nine or ten were likely present. The neural arch of each vertebra, as seen from above, is wider than the corresponding centrum. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low and undeveloped, like those of many other therizinosaurs. The postzygapophyseal facets had rounded, ventrally oriented articular surfaces. The posterior cervical vertebrae had ribs that were not fully attached, though this may reflect the ontogenetic stage of the holotype. Six (back) vertebrae are preserved, four of them articulated and exposed in lateral view, and the other two isolated and exposed in anterolateral (exposing the front and side) and lateral views. In the case of the isolated one preserved in lateral view, the centrum was subrectangular in shape, with slightly concave ventral borders. The one preserved in anterolateral view, interpreted as the middle dorsal, had a gracile neural spine, almost as tall as the dorsoventral (top-to-bottom) height of the centrum, and upswept transverse processes. The last four dorsal vertebrae were fused. The number of sacral vertebrae in &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; is unknown. The caudal (tail) series is represented by a total of thirty preserved vertebrae, though more were certainly present. Most of them are transversely compressed. All of them are amphicoelous, lacking pneumatisation. Anteriorly, the neural spines are subequal in height to the centra, though decrease in height posteriorly. The vertebrae towards the tip of the caudal column were fused into a pygostyle.

The pectoral girdle of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; is known from a right scapula, both coracoids, and a partial furcula. Like other basal therizinosaurs (and some more derived genera), the scapula and coracoid were separate, though this may be ontogenetic. The coracoids were subrectangular, similar to most other therizinosaurs, except for &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot;. The scapular blade was long and slender, slightly widening distally (far from the body axis). The glenoid fossa was oriented posteroventrally (downwards and towards the back), like other basal therizinosaurs. As in many maniraptorans, the forelimbs were somewhat longer than the hind limbs. The humerus was relatively straight, like some later therizinosaurs. A pointed internal tuberosity sat in the proximal end of the humerus, separated from the humeral head by a depression. Based on other basal therizinosaurs, the size ratio between the humerus and the ulna was roughly seventy-seven to seventy-eight percent. The ulnar shaft is oval-shaped medially, flatening distally. The radius was slightly larger than the ulna, though was more gracile. Nine carpal (wrist) elements are preserved in &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, though their identification is difficult, as their morphologies and positions do not line up. The manus (hand) is fairly complete. It was overall slender, as were the phalanges (digit bones; finger bones, in this case). The manual unguals (claws) were long and recurved, roughly equal in length to the phalanges they articulated to. Unlike in other therizinosaurs, the middle manual ungual was the largest.

The ilium of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; was shaped like a parallelogram, similar to that of birds and dromaeosaurids, but unlike that of later therizinosaurs. The pubic peduncle (to which the pubis attached) was longer than the ischiadic peduncle (to which the ischium attached), unlike more basal taxa and like more derived taxa. The pubes lack the proximal and distant ends, while the right ischium preserves the proximal portion and the left ischium preserves the shaft and distal portions. The pubes and ischia were almost equal in size, with the pubes being slightly longer. The femur was gracile, intermediate between the curved femur of &quot;Falcarius&quot; and the straight femur of later therizinosaurs. The lesser trochanter was winglike, separated from the greater trochanter by a narrow, deep cleft. The fourth trochanter was thin and long. The tibia was gracile and slender, with a relatively straight shaft. The fibula was slenderer and more gracile still. Tarsal (foot) elements are known in the form of the right astragalus, calcaneum, and a distal tarsal. The metatarsus is relatively complete, though only portions are visible through the matrix. The first metatarsal was robust. It did not contact the tarsus, and articulated with the second metatarsal on the mid-shaft. This differs from the condition seen in later therizinosaurs, which were functionally tetradactyl. The pedal (foot) phalanges are disarticulated and broken, so identification is difficult.

===Feathers and color===

The first feather impressions were found in the holotype specimen, consisting of short, slender filamentous feathers on the left arm. These impressions indicated that the body was predominately covered by downy feather-like fibers, similar to those of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, but longer, and oriented perpendicular to the arm. Xu et al. 1999 suggested that these downy feathers represent an intermediate stage between &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; and more advanced birds (Avialae). The tail was also covered in feathers between , consisting of parallel filaments with a width of , without a trace of pennaceous feathers or a tail fan, as indicated by the preserved pygostyle. A secondary coat of much longer, simpler feathers rose out of the down layer. These feathers, known as EBFFs (elongated broad filamentous feathers), were first described by Xu et al. 2009, based on specimen STM 31-1 consisting of the torso, head and neck. Xu and his team also found EBFFs in the tail of the holotype IVPP V11559, which were revealed by further preparation. Some of these were damaged during preparation.

The EBFFs differ from other feather types in that they consist of a single, unbranched filament. Most other primitive feathered dinosaurs have down-like feathers made up of two or more filaments branching out from a common base or along a central shaft. The EBFFs of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; are also much longer than other primitive feather types, measuring about long, roughly half the length of the neck. In &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, the longest feathers are only about 15% of the neck length. The EBFFs of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; are also unusually broad, up to wide in the holotype. The broadest feathers of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; are only wide, and only slightly wider in larger forms such as &quot;Dilong&quot;. Additionally, where most primitive feather types are circular in cross section, EBFFs appear to be oval-shaped. None of the preserved EBFFs were curved or bent beyond a broad arc in either specimen, indicating that they were fairly stiff. They were probably hollow, at least at the base.

Li et al. 2014 compared the color and shape of the melanosomes in 181 extant animal specimens, 13 fossil specimens (including &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;) and previous data about the melanosome diversity using scanning electron microscopes. They found that color in dinosaurs seem to be slightly connected with their physiology. While some species of living reptiles (lizards or crocodiles, which are ectothermic) have less diversity in the shape of melanosomes and darker color ranges, some maniraptorans, birds and mammals (which are endothermic) have an increased diversity of melanosome shapes and more vivid colors. The examined specimen of &quot;Beipaosaurus&quot;, BMNHC PH000911, preserves feather impressions which are located in the neck area. These are filamentous/sparse in structure and the sampled melanosomes were sphere-shaped and inferred to had a brownish colouration like those in modern reptiles which fall within the range of dark brownish colourations.

&quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; is another primitive therizinosaur taxon known from the same formation that was found with impressions of a series of filamentous and unbranched feathers in its holotype specimen. Only the distal ends of the feather impressions are visible and based on their morphology the feathers are considered to be EBFFs, bearing resemblance to those found along the specimens of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;. These findings suggest that they might have been used for visual display and were common among early therizinosaurs.

==Classification==
The affinities of therizinosaurs were originally obscure and often problematic, giving rise to taxonomic debate since they feature similar adaptations to the unrelated sauropodomorphs and ornithischians. The description of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; helped to assemble the definitive placement of therizinosaurs within the Theropoda, especially as maniraptorans thanks to the numerous theropod features and irrefutable feather impressions in the holotype. &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; was first assigned to the Therizinosauroidea, in a very primitive position by Xu et al. 1999. All subsequent phylogenetic analyses have confirmed this assignment. According to the definition by Paul Sereno of this group, &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; is even by definition the basal most member. Lindsay E. Zanno noted that &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; shares a sister-taxon relationship with &quot;Falcarius&quot;, a taxon that includes all the more derived therizinosauroids, however, it appears to be that &quot;Falcarius&quot; is more primitive than &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;.

The cladogram below is the result of the performed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria by Hartman et al. 2019 which is largely based on the data provided by the revision of Zanno in 2010. &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; occupied a more derived position than &quot;Falcarius&quot;, as previously indicated by Zanno:
Cau (2024) suggested that the contemporary &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; represents a junior synonym of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, since the diagnosis distinguishing the taxa was based on ontogenetically variable characters. As such, &quot;Jianchangosaurus&quot; would represent a less mature individual of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;.

==Paleobiology==

In 2018, McNamara and colleagues discovered the fossilised remains of skin flakes from numerous feathered dinosaurs from the Jehol Biota and some bird species using scanning electron microscope on the preserved feather impressions. The analyzed fossil taxa consisted of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, &quot;Microraptor&quot; and &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;. For &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;, the specimen STM 31-1 was analyzed.

By exposing the skin flakes under an electron microscope they found corneocytes, which are cells rich in keratin. In order to make comparisons with extant feathered dinosaurs, they analyzed several bird taxa such as &quot;Anas&quot;, &quot;Lonchura&quot; and &quot;Taeniopygia&quot; and found similar cell structures, but the fossil dinosaur corneocytes were more densely packed with keratin and lacking lipids (fat), suggesting that &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; and co-analyzed taxa did not get as warm as modern birds, mainly because they were ground-dwelling animals not able to fly. In the case of the primitive birds &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, they could not fly at all for long periods. In modern birds these structures, with the addition of fats, help to regulate body temperature during active flight.

In addition, the identified corneocytes structures seem to indicate that non-avian dinosaurs had a similar way of shedding skin to extant birds and mammals. Unlike many reptiles alive today (lizards or snakes) which shed their skin as a single piece or as several large pieces, &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; and other non-avian dinosaurs shed their skin as dandruff, like &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, modern birds or mammals.

==Paleoecology==
Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Yixian Formation involved seasonal climate fluctuations, and was warm and humid, punctuated by dry seasons, in which the environment became more arid. The average yearly temperature during the time of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; was , with relatively cold winters for the generally warm Mesozoic era. A study by Wu et al. 2013 concluded that orbital forcing, which is the effect on climate caused by shifts in the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis and by the shape of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, contributed to the climate fluctuations of this formation.

The Yixian Formation is well known for its great diversity of well-preserved specimens and its dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosauroids &quot;Dilong&quot; and &quot;Yutyrannus&quot;, the dromaeosaurids &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;, oviraptorosaurs including &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, compsognathids including &quot;Sinocalliopteryx&quot;, avialans including &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; and some non-theropod dinosaurs, such as &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dongbeititan&quot;.

Other contemporaries of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; included ancient shrimp, snails and slugs, as well as a diverse group of insects, and fish such as &quot;Lycoptera&quot;. Most vertebrates in this formation showed a tendency to become arboreal, including many tree-dwelling birds, and climbing mammals and lizards. The flora was dominated by conifers related to modern species that are found mainly in subtropical and temperate upland forests, with the presence of ferns, cycads, and horsetails.

<text>AMosaic was a port to the Amiga of the Mosaic web browser, developed beginning in 1993, and was the first graphical web browser for the Amiga. AMosaic was based on NCSA&#x27;s Mosaic, but was not distributed by the University of Illinois or NCSA. It was developed by Michael Fischer at Stony Brook University, Michael Meyer at the University of California, Berkeley, and Michael Witbrock at Carnegie Mellon University.

== Amiga-only features ==
At the time of its launch, AMosaic offered several features beyond the capabilities of Mosaic, thanks to the unique capabilities of the AmigaOS and existing support libraries.

The Magic User Interface (MUI) system used to construct the user interface enabled user full user-customization of fonts, colors, and background patterns.

AMosaic makes use of AmigaOS Datatypes for its external and inline image decoding, making it simple for users to extend the list of supported image types by installing the appropriate operating system plugin.

An ARexx inter-application communication interface was built into AMosaic, allowing simple scripting and transferring of data between AMosaic and other software. Using ARexx, users can write external scripts to ask AMosaic to retrieve a page and return it in ASCII format, or AMosaic can execute a script calling an external bookmark tracking program.

Uses the networking software DNet, AmiTCP 3.0b2, or AS225r2.

== Publicity == 
AMosaic was featured as the cover story in the March, 1995 issue of Amiga World magazine.

The original developers, Michael Fischer, Michael Meyer, and Michael Witbrock, co-wrote &quot;User Extensibility in Amiga Mosaic&quot;, which was presented by Michael Witbrock at the Second International World Wide Web Conference in Chicago, Illinois, October 17–20, 1994.

== System requirements ==
* AmigaOS 2.0 or greater
* AmiTCP 3.0 beta 2 or AS225 Release 2, or DNET
* Magic User Interface (MUI) 3.8
* Workbench 3 users need the ZGIF DataType to decode inlined GIF images

<text>The Rookies is an American police procedural series created by Rita Lakin that originally aired on ABC from September 11, 1972 to March 30, 1976. It follows the exploits of three rookie police officers working in an unidentified city for the fictitious Southern California Police Department (SCPD).

==History==
The success of Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s book &quot;The New Centurions&quot;, as well as NBC&#x27;s ratings success with &quot;Adam-12&quot;, had sparked interest at the time in a more realistic depiction and storytelling of the typical uniformed police officer. Although various incidents during the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly in California, had sparked controversy and negative feelings toward police officers in general, &quot;The Rookies&quot; tried to better humanize the character of a police officer and show the struggles that new, younger men and women (who were often Vietnam-era military veterans or college graduates) faced in their lives as law enforcement persons sworn to serve and protect the public.

The pilot for the series began as an ABC Movie of the Week airing on March 7, 1972. The TV movie features five rookies newly arrived at a police academy in southern California: cadets Jared Whitman (Robert F. Lyons), Kevin Lassiter (Jeff Pomerantz), Mike Danko (Sam Melville), William &quot;Willie&quot; Gillis (Michael Ontkean), and Terry Webster (Georg Stanford Brown), all coming from different backgrounds including the military, college and social work. The cadets&#x27; training sergeant was Eddie Ryker, played by Darren McGavin. In the later series, Sgt. Ryker was promoted to lieutenant and was played by Gerald S. O&#x27;Loughlin. The character of Jill Danko in the movie pilot was played by Jennifer Billingsley, but was recast for the series with Kate Jackson appearing as a registered nurse.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Rookies&quot; centers around three rookie officers: Danko, Webster and Gillis, and their superior officer/mentor Lieutenant Ryker. The show was produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. Each episode showcased highly dramatized versions of police cases and activities, often intertwined with the off-duty lives of the officers and their wives. Danko was the only officer in the series who was married. Although filmed in and around Los Angeles, the &quot;SCPD&quot; badge the officers wore was said to stand for &quot;Southern California Police Department&quot;. After the second season, Ontkean left the show, reportedly over complaints regarding the writing and storylines. Gillis was replaced by Officer Chris Owens, played by Bruce Fairbairn.

During the series&#x27; third season, a two-part episode (titled &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;) aired on February 17, 1975 and served as the pilot for the spin-off series &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; The &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; two-part pilot aired only once on ABC, and subsequently was never part of the syndicated TV rerun package as Spelling-Goldberg decided it might confuse viewers as to which TV show it belonged. The &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; pilot is now considered &quot;lost&quot;.

==Syndication==
In September 1974, Spelling-Goldberg Productions and Worldvision Enterprises (who previously distributed programming produced by Spelling and ABC in the syndication market) signed a contract giving Worldvision exclusive distribution rights to the series for 25 years. However, Worldvision backed out of the contract in May 1975, and in 1976, Spelling-Goldberg sued Worldvision for more than $5.6 million in damages, plus &quot;general damages for fraud to be ascertained&quot;. Viacom Enterprises would then acquire distribution rights to &quot;The Rookies&quot; in the place of Worldvision, for broadcast beginning in 1977; as Viacom intended to sell the program for broadcast during Family Viewing Hour, they elected to edit out portions that they deemed too violent for family viewing. In addition, five episodes were excluded from the original syndicated run, due to their overt violent content. Viacom also offered local stations the option to air either the condensed 30-minute episodes or the regular, full length 60-minute episodes.

The same year Viacom assumed distribution of &quot;The Rookies&quot; in 1977, Spelling-Goldberg sold their production company to Columbia Pictures Television, which would take over syndication of &quot;The Rookies&quot; following the expiration of Viacom&#x27;s contract. Sony Pictures Television, who owns most of Spelling-Goldberg&#x27;s output, is the current distributor.

The series was seen in reruns on TV Land in 2003. In 2014, the show aired on Grit weekday mornings (though sometimes preempted by movies). In 2016, the show aired on FamilyNet six days a week.

The series began on Heroes &amp; Icons network in March 2021, airing overnights on Saturdays.

&quot;The Rookies&quot; aired on May 29 and 30, 2021 on Decades TV Network as part of &quot;The Decades Binge&quot;.

As of January 23, 2025, the series is available for streaming on The Roku Channel.
==Home media==
On July 17, 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The original pilot film was not included as part of this release.

On August 7, 2012 Shout Factory released the complete second season on DVD in Region 1.

<doc id="1179712" wikidata="Q512133" url="?curid=1179712" title="Joseph Bodin de Boismortier">
<text>Joseph Bodin de Boismortier (23 December 1689 – 28 October 1755) was a French baroque composer of instrumental music, cantatas, opéra-ballets, and vocal music. Boismortier was one of the first composers to have no patrons: having obtained a royal licence for engraving music in 1724, he made enormous sums of money by publishing his music for sale to the public.

==Biography==
The Boismortier family moved from the composer&#x27;s birthplace in Thionville (in Lorraine) to the town of Metz where he received his musical education from Joseph Valette de Montigny, a well-known composer of motets. The Boismortier family then followed Montigny and moved to Perpignan in 1713 where Boismortier found employment in the Royal Tobacco Control.

Boismortier married Marie Valette, the daughter of a rich goldsmith and a relative of his teacher Montigny. In 1724 Boismortier and his wife moved to Paris where he began a prodigious composition career, writing for many instruments and voices. He was prolific: his first works appeared in Paris in 1724, and by 1747 he had published more than 100 works in various vocal and instrumental combinations. His music, particularly for the voice, was extremely popular and made him wealthy without the aid of patrons.

Boismortier was the first French composer to use the Italian concerto form, in his six concertos for five flutes op. 15. (1727). He also wrote the first French solo concerto for any instrument, a concerto for cello, viol, or bassoon (1729). Much of his music is for the flute, for which he also wrote an instruction method (now lost). Boismortier and Rameau both lived during the Rococo era of Louis XV and upheld the French tradition, composing music of beauty and sophistication that was widely appreciated. Although known as a composer, Bodin de Boismortier was also famed during his lifetime for his excessively inattentive and wandering mind that often kept him from conducting his own works.

His six sonatas for flute and harpsichord op. 91, first published in Paris in 1742, were printed with an homage to the celebrated French flautist and composer, Michel Blavet (1700-1768). Today, they are probably his most popular pieces, for they indeed show Boismortier at his most creative and graceful. A notable piece of Boismortier&#x27;s that is still often performed is the &quot;Deuxieme serenade ou simphonie&quot;.

He died in Roissy-en-Brie, where, at his request, he was buried in the Eglise Saint Germain.

The playwright and novelist Suzanne Bodin de Boismortier was his daughter. A full-length biography on the composer,&quot; Joseph Bodin de Boismortier&quot;, by Stephan Perreau, was published in France in 2001.

==A quotation==
The music theorist Jean-Benjamin de la Borde wrote in his (Essay on ancient and modern music) in 1780 about Boismortier: (Happy is Boismortier, whose fertile pen can give birth without pain to a whole new volume of music every month.)

In response to such comments, it is said that Boismortier would simply answer &quot;I&#x27;m earning money.&quot;

<doc id="1179714" wikidata="Q1049766" url="?curid=1179714" title="Kikkawa Hiroie">
<text> (December 7, 1561 – October 22, 1625) was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Azuchi–Momoyama period through early Edo period. 
Hiroie&#x27;s father was Kikkawa Motoharu and his mother was a daughter of Kumagai Nobunao.

==Biography==
He initially was named &quot;Tsunenobu&quot; (経信) and made his debut on the battlefield on 1578 against Amago Katsuhisa with his father. On 1583, he was sent to then the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler Hashiba Hideyoshi as a hostage.

From 1586 to 1587, his father and his elder brother Kikkawa Motonaga both died and he became the head of Kikkawa clan. Around this time, he changed his name to &quot;Hiroie&quot;. Unlike his father and his elder brother who was known for the battlefield bravery, Hiroie preferred strategy and diplomacy to win on a battlefield and was highly praised by Hideyoshi for holding the Mōri clan together after the death of Kobayakawa Takakage. 

During the Seven-Year Korean War, he is noted for the defeat of a much larger &quot;Ming army&quot; at the siege of Ulsan castle.

==Battle Of Sekigahara==
In the Battle of Sekigahara on 1600, Hiroie judged that the Tokugawa side would win. However, as one of the five leading elders of the Toyotomi government, Mōri Terumoto and several of the Mōri clan&#x27;s retainers was supportive of the pro-Toyotomi forces led by Ishida Mitsunari. In order to ensure the survival of the clan, Hiroie made a secret pact with the Tokugawa side through Kuroda Nagamasa, promising to Mōri neutrality during the battle in exchange for guarantees of the existing Mōri domains.

Although Mōri Terumoto was made the nominal commander-in-chief of the western army, he remained in the Osaka Castle. Instead, the Mōri field army joined the rest of the western forces under the command of Mōri Hidemoto, with Hiroie commanding the vanguards. On the day of the actual battle, September 15, the Mōri army deployed on the flank of the Tokugawa forces. However, when Hidemoto ordered an assault, Hiroie refused to comply and used the vanguards under his command to block off the attack routes. Hiroie was thus able to prevent the bulk of the Mōri army from engaging the Tokugawa troops.

The bulk of the Mōri army therefore never actually took part in the battle. However, after Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged victorious, several documents incriminating Mōri Terumoto were found in the Osaka Castle. Ieyasu believed the documents showed that Terumoto was involved more deeply in the western army than Hiroie had presented, and thus voided their secret pact. Initially he wished to completely confiscate all Mōri domains and give two provinces to Hiroie as a reward.

However the offer shocked Hiroie, whose motivation was to ensure the Mōri clan&#x27;s survival. Eventually Ieyasu relented, and instead reduced the Mōri clan&#x27;s domains to just two provinces under the condition that Mōri Terumoto retired. Although Hiroie succeeded in keeping the Mōri clan&#x27;s &quot;daimyō&quot; status, the Mōri clan lost over 3 quarters of its former territories.

Because Hiroie had proceeded with the secret negotiations without the clan&#x27;s approval or knowledge, once the events came to light he came under intense attacks from his own clan. Many considered him a traitor, especially since it was felt that his actions during the battle was instrumental in the Tokugawa victory that led to the disastrous punishment. Hidemoto in particular would become his bitter rival in Mōri clan politics.

After the battle, Terumoto gave a portion of his much reduced domain to Hiroie. He is therefore often mistakenly considered the first ruler of an Iwakuni han; however, unlike the Mōri shihans that were established for branches of the Mōri clan in the same period, Hiroie and his descendants were not made &quot;daimyōs&quot; in their own right until the Meiji Restoration. Instead, the Kikkawa family continued to be senior retainers of the Mōri clan until the end of the Bakufu, at which point the Iwakuni domain officially became a han.

==Death==
In 1614, Hiroie was succeeded by Kikkawa Hiromasa, his eldest son.

Hiroie died on October 22, 1625, twelve years after passing the clan leadership to his heir. 

Hiroie worked for prosperity of his domain; he is remembered for having laid down a set of laws with 188 clauses (the &quot;Kikkawa-shi hatto&quot;).

<text>Brabantio (sometimes called Brabanzio) is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; (c. 1601–1604). He is a Venetian senator and the father of Desdemona.

Brabantio makes his first appearance in 1.1 when Iago and Roderigo rouse him with the news that Desdemona has eloped. In 1.2, Brabantio is led to the Sagittary, where the newlyweds are found and there accuses Othello of using magic to bewitch his daughter. In 1.3, he brings Othello to trial before the Duke and once again accuses him of using witchcraft upon his daughter. When Desdemona arrives, she tells her father that she respects him only because they are related, and that Othello is whom she truly loves. Brabantio grudgingly accepts what she says, but not without complaining to the senators in an attempt at having Othello stripped of his title; when this is unsuccessful, he disowns his daughter. 

Film interpreters of the role include Friedrich Kühne in the 1922 silent version starring Emil Jannings, Hilton Edwards in Orson Welles&#x27; 1952 film, Anthony Nicholls in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1965 film, and Pierre Vaneck in the 1995 film starring Laurence Fishburne.

<text>Live A Live is a 1994 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. A remake was published by Square Enix in Japan and Nintendo worldwide, releasing first for Nintendo Switch in 2022, and the following year for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows. The game follows seven distinct scenarios scattered across different time periods, with two more unlockable scenarios linking the narratives together through the recurring antagonist Odio. Gameplay is split between exploration with story-specific twists, and turn-based combat played out on a grid.

Production began in late 1993, and was the directorial debut of Takashi Tokita. Tokita wanted to tell multiple stories within a single game, with each section drawing inspiration from different sources. Character designs for the seven main scenarios were handled by different manga artists. The music was composed by Yoko Shimomura as her first large-scale project after joining Square.

Reception of the game has been positive, with praise going to its unique gameplay and narrative mechanics, though its short length was faulted. The remake was praised by Western reviewers, particularly its overall design and redone graphics and music, though several noted gameplay elements that had aged poorly. Selling 270,000 units, the original release was considered a failure, while the remake sold 500,000 copies worldwide. Tokita&#x27;s work on &quot;Live A Live&quot; influenced his later projects.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Live A Live&quot; is a role-playing video game in which the player takes on the role of eight different protagonists through nine scenarios. While each narrative has the same basic mechanics, individual stories have unique gimmicks; these include the use of stealth, a lack of standard battles, or using telepathy to learn new facts to progress the narrative. With the exception of one scenario, the player character navigates themed environments, ranging from the overworld area to dungeon environments. Battles are triggered differently for each scenario; some are random encounters, some have enemy sprites which can be avoided, while others are entirely scripted.

The turn-based battle system is used across all scenarios, and features the player character and sometimes a party fighting enemies on a 7x7 grid, with characters able to move and perform actions such as attacking or using particular skills. Skills can be used without limit, though some take multiple turns to charge. Some abilities imbue tiles with extra properties, such as healing a character or dealing elemental damage. There are also different skill systems in place; there is gaining levels with experience points, which unlocks new abilities, though in others character progression is locked behind story events. In one scenario techniques are learned through seeing an opponent use them. Each character can also equip and use items, such as accessories to boost attack or items to recover health. If the player character, or party, is defeated, the game ends.

The 2022 remake carries over the basic gameplay from the original, though redesigned and updated for the new graphical style, and with some features intended for ease of play compared to the original. Bars are added representing a character&#x27;s health and &quot;charge&quot; time before their move is executed. Other additions include a sparkling effect over items and materials that can be gathered, a display showing a move&#x27;s area of effect, and an optional radar system which shows the position of objectives on the map.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Live A Live&quot; is split into seven chapters, covering prehistoric, ancient Chinese, feudal Japanese, Wild West, present day, near future, and distant future eras. In each scenario, the protagonist confronts a powerful enemy whose name is or incorporates the word &quot;Odio&quot;. After completing these scenarios, an eighth chapter set in the Middle Ages is unlocked, which in turn unlocks a final chapter tying the narratives together.

* Prehistory: The First: The caveman Pogo is exiled by his tribe after rescuing and hiding Beru, a woman intended for sacrifice by a rival tribe to their dinosaur god, Odo. Pogo and Beru, having fallen in love and allied with friendly members of both tribes, successfully kill Odo and unite their tribes.
* Imperial China: The Successor: The aging Shifu of the endangered Earthen Heart martial art chooses three disciples to inherit his skills. A rival school led by the ruthless Ou Di Wan Lee kills the two less experienced students. The Shifu and his surviving student defeat Ou Di Wan Lee and his students, with the Shifu sacrificing his life force to empower his surviving student. The Shifu dies after this battle, and his student begins passing down his teachings.
* Twilight of Edo Japan: The Infiltrator: Trainee ninja Oboromaru is sent by his master on a mission to rescue a politically important person and kill his captor Ode Iou, a demon disguised as a daimyo intent on conquering Japan. Oboromaru defeats Ode Iou and rescues the man, who turns out to be Sakamoto Ryōma, who is helping to open Japan to the West.
* The Wild West: The Wanderer: A wandering gunslinger called the Sundown Kid meets with the bounty hunter Mad Dog in an isolated town for a gun duel. The pair end up working together to liberate the town from the Crazy Bunch bandit gang, led by O. Dio. After defeating O. Dio, revealed to be a horse possessed by the dead of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Sundown Kid leaves the town having rediscovered the value of protecting others, with his final encounters with Mad Dog varying depending on player choice.
* Present Day: The Strongest: Masaru Takahara wants to become the strongest person in the world, believing that defeating opponents in each fighting style would accomplish this goal. While Masaru succeeds, he is confronted by another fighter Odie O&#x27;Bright, who has been killing his opponents because he deemed them weak. Odie O&#x27;Bright challenges Masaru, who kills him using his combined learned abilities, becoming the strongest fighter.
* The Near Future: The Outsider: Psychic orphan Akira Tadokoro goes in pursuit of a biker gang called the Crusaders, seeking retribution for his father&#x27;s death. Together with his friend Matsu, Akira pursues the Crusaders, learning that they are being used by the government to obtain sacrifices for an idol dubbed Odeo, which seeks to bring an enforced peace by assimilating all of humanity. Matsu−confessing that he killed Akira&#x27;s father as the Crusaders&#x27; original leader−sacrifices himself trying to move the mech Steel Titan. With his powers, Akira uses the Steel Titan to destroy Odeo, ending the conspiracy.
* The Distant Future: The Mechanical Heart: The cargo ship &quot;Cogito Ergo Sum&quot; is carrying a monster to Earth. Maintenance robot Cube ends up investigating the incident when the monster escapes and begins killing the crew, which, combined with fatal accidents, causes the survivors to turn on one another. The ultimate culprit is the ship&#x27;s computer, OD-10, who wants to curtail the crew&#x27;s recurring antisocial behavior by wiping them out. Cube hacks and deactivates OD-10, allowing the survivors and Cube to arrive to Earth after killing the monster.
* The Middle Ages: The Lord of Dark: After the knight Oersted defeats his friend Streibough in a contest for the hand of Princess Alethea of Lucrece, Alethea is kidnapped by subordinates of the Lord of Dark, having apparently returned. Oersted leads a party that includes Streibough to rescue Alethea. They defeat the Lord of Dark, revealed to be a lesser monster in disguise, but Streibough is apparently killed and Alethea remains missing. Back at the castle, Oersted is tricked by a magical illusion into killing Lucrece&#x27;s king, causing its people to denounce him as a demon. Escaping and with his party dead, Oersted discovers that a jealous Streibough faked his death. Oersted kills Streibough and finds Alethea, but she blames Oersted for Streibough&#x27;s actions before killing herself. A despairing Oersted becomes the new Lord of Dark, taking on the name Odio.

In the final chapter, &quot;Dominion of Hate&quot;, Odio draws the seven protagonists—Pogo, the Shifu&#x27;s student, Oboromaru, the Sundown Kid, Masaru, Akira and Cube—to Lucrece to confront their heroism; the player then chooses who to play as. Choosing Oersted begins a scenario where he fights each hero using their respective Odio incarnations, either wiping out humanity and living in a world devoid of life, or obliterating the universe in a final devastating attack if he loses. Choosing any other protagonist has that character assemble and lead the party to a final battle with Odio&#x27;s true form. The party can either kill Oersted, trapping them in Lucrece forever; or spare him, leading to final battles with each form of Odio, which Oersted describes as the physical incarnation of hatred. In the remake (provided the player recruited all playable characters at least once), Oersted&#x27;s hate manifests into a demon called Sin of Odio that initially overwhelms the party, but Oersted breaks free with their help and destroys it. A repentant and dying Oersted sends each protagonist back to their time periods, warning them that enough hate can create another Lord of Dark.

==Development==
&quot;Live A Live&quot; was developed by Development Division 5 of Square, noted as creators of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The game was the directorial debut of Takashi Tokita, who had previously worked in a designer role for &quot;Hanjuku Hero&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. The original concept was born from the desire to make an RPG where players could experience multiple standalone stories at once, contrasting against &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; where smaller stories served a grand narrative arc. The production was made possible by the expanding storage capacity of the Super Famicom ROM, with the aim being for players to be able to complete each section within a day. Several staff members, including designer Nobuyuki Inoue and lead programmer Fumiaki Fukaya, had worked on either &quot;Hanjuku Hero&quot; or the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Active production began in December 1993, though the entire development including early planning lasted one and a half years. It was produced for the Super Famicom&#x27;s 16-megabit cartridge.

Tokita had difficulty adjusting to his role as director, particularly as he could not be as hands-on with the graphical elements as he had been for &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Except for menus and battles, Fukaya was responsible for all the game&#x27;s programming. Tokita put an equal amount of effort into each world design. Many of the world suggestions came from other members of staff, with Tokita choosing what he thought were the best. The first world created was the Middle Ages edition, which informed both the wider narrative and the gameplay design. The scenarios originally had a graduating difficulty scale, but Tokita abandoned this so players could tackle the scenarios in any order they wished. Inoue was responsible for the battle system design, wanting to make a strategic experience which Tokita described as &quot;real-time shogi&quot;. Another goal was to evolve the standard gameplay of RPGs at the time. One idea of Tokita&#x27;s that was rejected involved not displaying hit points, but having the character physically act like they had been injured or look weakened as they took damage instead. Once production finished, the team split up to work on other projects within Square.

===Scenario and art design===
A notable feature of &quot;Live A Live&quot; were the artists brought in to design the lead cast of the seven main sections. The artists were Yoshihide Fujiwara (&quot;Imperial China&quot;), Yoshinori Kobayashi (&quot;Prehistory&quot;), Osamu Ishiwata (&quot;The Wild West&quot;), Yumi Tamura (&quot;Distant Future&quot;), Ryōji Minagawa (&quot;Present Day&quot;), Gosho Aoyama (&quot;Twilight of Edo Japan&quot;) and Kazuhiko Shimamoto (&quot;The Near Future&quot;). This was possible due to Square&#x27;s publishing ties with Shogakukan, who was associated with those artists. Additional character artwork, including designs for the &quot;Lord of Dark&quot; narrative, was done by Kiyofumi Katō of Square. Further in-game graphics were designed by Yukiko Sasaki, who worked as a map designer on &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Sasaki encountered difficulties with the graphics, struggling to design the Edo Japan scenario and needed to cut elements such as telegraph poles from Present Day scenario. Having multiple character designers was not in the original plan, but emerged to complement the &quot;omnibus&quot; storytelling. This style of having one artist in charge for each world was unusual for Square, who previously had a single graphic designer in charge of all art direction.

Fujiwara was known for his work on the martial arts manga &quot;Kenji&quot;. For the Imperial China protagonist&#x27;s female student, Fujiwara deliberately went against stereotypes of martial arts heroines with large breasts, drawing her with a &quot;tighter&quot; figure. Shimamoto was originally going for an anime-styled design for his characters, but changed it to one based on traditional manga when he saw the other designers&#x27; work. Akira&#x27;s partner Matsu was physically based on actor Yūsaku Matsuda. Ishiwata based the protagonist of the Wild West on the cowboy figures portrayed by Clint Eastwood. Aoyama designed Oboromaru very quickly, and at Tokita&#x27;s request based Ode Iou&#x27;s design on the Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga. Tamura was in the middle of her work on &quot;Basara&quot; when she was approached about the project, and it was her only work in video game character design. Katō designed the sprites of the Middle Ages cast based on templates from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, with Oersted being directly based on the Warrior of Light.

The scenario was co-written by Tokita and Inoue. As with his other work, Tokita drew inspiration from the tone and dramatic moments of the manga &quot;Devilman&quot;. He also based its structure on &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, with the script emulating the style of anime and manga. The Prehistory story drew inspiration from the manga series &quot;First Human Giatrus&quot;, while the Wild West narrative was based on climactic scenes from classic Westerns including &quot;Shane&quot;. The Near Future story made several references to classic mecha manga and anime. Along with its references to classic martial arts films, the name of the protagonist in the Present Day narrative was made up of kanji symbols taken from the names of four famous wrestlers. The Distant Future narrative was inspired by &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;. Cube&#x27;s name, created by a member of the development staff, was a reference to Stanley Kubrick. The Middle Ages story paid homage to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, with the relationship between Orstead and Streibough mirroring that between Cecil Harvey and Kain Highwind. Tokita was concerned about creating the Middle Ages story due to its similarity to the ongoing &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; series. The final chapter and its selectable lead protagonists emulated the freedom of choice present in &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;. Inoue created the recurring gag character of Watanabe, a normal man who suffers misfortune in each era, to represent the normal people who die during each scenario.

===Music===

The music was composed and arranged by Yoko Shimomura. After writing music for Capcom on multiple projects including &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Shimomura moved to Square in 1993, fuelled by the wish to compose for RPGs. &quot;Live A Live&quot; was Shimomura&#x27;s first major RPG composition, and her first job after arriving at Square. Her only previous work on RPGs was minor work on &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; prior to leaving Capcom. As with the rest of the game, Shimomura&#x27;s music reflected the different eras in which the narrative was set. The main theme appeared multiple times through the score in arranged versions, an idea shared by both Shimomura and Tokita. Shimomura wrote the score on a PC-9800 series, then ported it into the Super Famicom sound environment.

The boss theme &quot;Megalomania&quot; was written to be frenetic and exciting. For the motif of Odio, Shimomura used a simulated pipe organ, incorporating it into &quot;Megalomania&quot; to reference its recurring threat. The music for the Middle Ages period was the most difficult for Shimomura to write, though it was among the first asked for by Tokita. Upon hearing of her struggles, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu offered to help. Writing the score for the Middle Ages became easier once the theme &quot;Overlord Overture&quot; and battle theme &quot;Dignified Battle&quot; were completed. The music for the Captain Square minigame in the Distant Future scenario was deliberately written to evoke the chiptune style of NES and early arcade titles.

A soundtrack album for the game was released in August 1994 by NTT Publishing. The album was reissued on iTunes in July 2008 as one of the first releases from &quot;Square Enix Presents Legendary Tracks&quot;, a series of rare album re-releases. A physical re-release was published by Square Enix&#x27;s music label in May 2012.

In 2008, the tracks &quot;Birds in the Sky, Fish in the River&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Wings&quot; were included on &quot;Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura&quot;, a compilation of the composer&#x27;s work at Square Enix. Remixed and karaoke versions of &quot;Kiss of Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot; were released on the 2014 compilation album &quot;Memoria&quot;, which also featured tracks from Shimomura&#x27;s work with Square. &quot;Birds in the Sky, Fish in the River&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot; were later released in 2015 as downloadable content for &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call&quot;. Also that year, a tribute concert was held in Kichijoji at Club Seata, featuring performances by multiple musicians including Shimomura, and guest appearances from the game&#x27;s staff including Tokita.

==Release==
&quot;Live A Live&quot; was released on September 2, 1994. Originally meant to be released in Japan before &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, delays occurred in &quot;Live A Live&quot;″s production and the release order was reversed. Prior to release, Tamura created a prequel manga to the Distant Future scenario, later noting that she drew the manga without Square&#x27;s permission. The game was re-released through Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console for Wii U on June 17, 2015. A Virtual Console port to Nintendo 3DS was released on November 28, 2016. The release was prompted by fan demand for the title, and then-publisher Square Enix had to get permission from the guest illustrators before the re-release could happen. Characters from &quot;Live A Live&quot; were featured in 20th anniversary crossovers with the mobile games &quot;Holy Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Legends: The Space-Time Crystal&quot;.

Until 2022, &quot;Live A Live&quot; remained exclusive to Japan. A rumor reported by &quot;GamePro&quot; was that the title was originally planned for an English release. In an interview with the magazine &quot;Super Play&quot;, Square localization staff member Ted Woolsey said that its overseas release was unlikely due to its low graphical quality compared to other popular titles at the time. A fan translation was created by noted online translation group Aeon Genesis. Speaking in later interviews, Tokita felt that his experience with &quot;Live A Live&quot; helped solidify his directing and storytelling.

===Remake===

On the subject of a remake, Tokita said it would depend entirely on fan demand. He later revealed that multiple attempts at a sequel or remake had fallen through over the years. After joining the Square Enix team developing &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot;, known for its &quot;HD-2D&quot; graphical style which blended sprite art with 3D graphics, Tokita was inspired to remake &quot;Live A Live&quot; using the graphical style of &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot;. The remake was made possible because Square Enix had been in talks over licencing from Shogakukan since the original&#x27;s Virtual Console release. Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda had himself voiced a wish to remake older titles using the HD-2D design, and &quot;Live A Live&quot; was at the top of a list of proposed titles.

Work on the remake began in 2019, with development proving challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic and preserving the variety of playstyles. The remake was co-developed by Square Enix&#x27;s Team Asano, and Japanese developer Historia. Tokita acted as producer, while Shun Sasaki of Historia worked as director, with much of the staff being young and unrelated to the development of the original version. Sasaki expressed disbelief when approached about the remake, but accepted as many staff members were fans of &quot;Live A Live&quot;. It was built using Unreal Engine. The UI and sound effects were updated, and the gameplay was rebalanced. It also saw gameplay additions of in-game radars and maps. The character designs were redrawn by Naoki Ikushima.

Shimomura returned to orchestrate and arrange the soundtrack. The original MIDI sound files had been lost, so the score had to be &quot;copied&quot; from the original, with her feeling pressure due to the soundtrack&#x27;s popularity among fans. The Near Future chapter also included a vocal version of the theme &quot;Go! Go! Buriki Daioh!&quot;, performed by Hironobu Kageyama. Known for performing &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; opening theme &quot;Cha-La Head-Cha-La&quot;, Kageyama also recorded an English version for the Western release. The lyrics were taken from a 1994 Famitsu competition where readers sent in lyrics for the song. Voice acting for main and important characters was included with the cast being chosen by Tokita based on his initial concepts for what the characters would sound like. Voice actor Tomokazu Sugita, a fan of the original game, appeared in roles across all the time periods.

The remake was released on July 22, 2022; Square Enix published the game in Japan, while Nintendo published it in the West. In Japan, it comes in both a physical and digital version, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition from Square Enix&#x27;s website. The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a model of the Buriki Daioh mech designed by Shinamoto, a themed board game, a soundtrack collection with booklet, and a shoulder bag. A demo covering the opening chapters of the Imperial China, Edo and Far Future storylines, with progress being transferrable into the main game, was released in Japan on June 28. A soundtrack album, containing the same tracks as featured in the Collector&#x27;s Edition, was released in Japan on July 27. Square Enix released ports for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Windows on April 27, 2023. A demo similar to the Switch version was published alongside the ports&#x27; announcement.

==Reception==

The original release of &quot;Live A live&quot; sold 270,000 copies in Japan, which at the time was considered a failure compared to the company&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; releases. Tokita attributed the low sales to its release as a new project competing against entries in established series. Between July and September 2022, the remake sold 500,000 copies worldwide, with over 140,000 units being sold in Japan.

The four &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers enjoyed the game&#x27;s variety, but found the graphics lacking compared to other Super Famicom titles of the time. In its review, Micro Magazine&#x27;s publication &quot;Game Criticism&quot; lauded the attempt at its omnibus storytelling style and use of popular manga artists, but ultimately felt it lacked substance and heavily criticized the final chapters and &quot;imbalance&quot; between the mature narrative and low-difficulty gameplay. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; lauded both the omnibus narrative and battle system, but felt that the title was too short; the magazine concluded that the game was a &quot;one-of-a-kind experience&quot; Jenni Lada, writing for website &quot;GamerTell&quot;, included the title in a list of the best Super Famicom titles exclusive to Japan, praising its variety compared to other titles for the platform. In 2011, &quot;GamePro&quot; included it on the list of the 14 best JRPGs that were not released in English, adding that &quot;rumor has it the game was originally slated for a US release, making its absence here sting all the more.&quot;

The remake met with a &quot;generally favorable&quot; reception according to review aggregator website &quot;Metacritic&quot;, earning a score of 81 points out of 100 based on 86 reviews. Critics focused praise on the graphics and audio design together with the redone musical score, praising its faithful reproduction for first-time Western players and variety of settings and narratives, with complaints mainly stemming from by-then archaic mechanics carried over from the original and lack of character development in its chapters.

The &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers were again positive, praising the remake&#x27;s faithfulness to the original alongside the HD-2D conversion, with the main complaints being a lack of noticeable changes or maps for navigating levels. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell described the remake as &quot;essentially Sidequest: The Game&quot;, enjoying it for the most part and noting its variety as a positive, though noting a lack of empowered female characters. Andrew Reiner, writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, was very positive about the remake and recommended it to genre fans, with his one complaint being pacing issues with some chapters, Heidi Kemps of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game&#x27;s subversion of genre and gaming tropes, citing it as a game that had aged well and benefited from the remake.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Rebekah Valentine described the remake positively as a time capsule showing the experimental style of RPGs of the time, noting the variety within the story and battle system and extra content tied to the overarching narrative. Alana Hagues, writing for &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, enjoyed her time with the remake despite some vague directions in the latter half of the game, additionally praising the localization for convincingly mimicking accents from each time period and location. Paige Chamberlain of &quot;RPG Site&quot; called the remake the best way to experience the game due to its translation and added features alongside the graphical upgrade, noting that the overall narrative was simple yet engaging and fun. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot;″s Jordan Rudek was less positive than many reviewers, lauding its release in the West after so long exclusive to Japan, but finding its design archaic enough to impact his enjoyment.

<doc id="1179734" wikidata="Q112185" url="?curid=1179734" title="Walter Berry (bass-baritone)">
<text>Walter Berry (8 April 1929 – 27 October 2000) was an Austrian lyric bass-baritone who enjoyed a prominent career in opera. He has been cited as one of several exemplary operatic bass-baritones of his era.

==Professional career==
Walter Berry was born in Vienna. He studied voice at the Vienna Music Academy and made his stage debut with the Vienna State Opera in 1947. He became a permanent member of the company in 1950, remaining with that ensemble for his entire career, although he undertook frequent guest appearances elsewhere in Europe and in the UK.

In 1952, Berry made his first appearance at the Salzburg Festival, where he subsequently performed on a regular basis. While in Salzburg, he collaborated with Herbert von Karajan conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in a production of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with Leontyne Price and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. While appearing in Vienna and Salzburg, Berry interpreted an extensive operatic repertoire which included over one hundred roles. He received high praise for his interpretations of the lieder of Franz Schubert as well as songs by Gustav Mahler. Included among his acclaimed renditions of sacred works were: Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Passions&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis.&quot;

Berry made many memorable appearances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s in such roles as Barak in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, Telramund in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, Wotan in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Baron Ochs in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, Don Pizarro in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Don Alfonso in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, the Music Master in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and Leporello in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. He sang his last Barak on 18 November 1984.

Berry&#x27;s other signature roles include Papageno in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Figaro in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; and Bluebeard in Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;. He was also a noted interpreter of lieder and was accompanied often at recitals by the German pianist Sebastian Peschko. Berry also appeared in choral works. Performing in light-hearted operettas, particularly &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, was one of his pleasures.

Berry married mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig in 1957 and collaborated with her both on stage and in several recordings. They were divorced in 1970.

===Death===
Walter Berry died in 2000 at the age of 71 in Vienna following a heart attack. He was entombed in the Heiligenstädter Friedhof cemetery (Part A, Group 1, Number 263) in Vienna.

==Recordings==

Berry was a prolific recording artist and participated in many highly acclaimed opera recordings, including the classic Otto Klemperer recordings of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (as Papageno) and &quot;Fidelio&quot; (as Don Pizarro), both for EMI Records. He also recorded Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s sacred oratorio &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot; for Columbia Records with Otto Klemperer and the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1961 and years later for Deutsche Grammophon with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic in 1972.

Also included among his recorded performances are: Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (London Records), Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; (Deutsche Grammophone), Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; (Deutsche Grammophon), Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Cosi Fan Tutte&quot; and &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; (both EMI), and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; (Philips).

Critics at &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted that his collaboration with his wife Christa Ludwig in a recording of Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; was delivered with dramatic force and strength. In 1967, &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s critics also praised his recording with Ludwig of scenes from Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; issued in the United States on the RCA Victrola label, as outstanding and worthy of Strauss&#x27; best traditions. Berry&#x27;s definitive recordings have earned him the distinction of being cited as one of the truly exemplary bass baritones and basses in opera.

Berry recorded on DVD as Don Pizarro, opposite Ludwig, James King, and Josef Greindl; and as Papageno with Pilar Lorengar as Pamina; also as Leporello opposite Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the title role and Josef Greindl, in a performance in German of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

<text>Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less was Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s first novel, first published in 1976. It was said to have been inspired by Archer&#x27;s real-life experience of near-bankruptcy.

==Synopsis==

Harvey Metcalfe, a Polish immigrant to the United States, rises from messenger boy to corporate magnate, combining business skills with little loyalty and much ruthlessness. Over 40 years, he has mastered the shady deal, and by the 1960s is a multi-millionaire.

Taking advantage of a British decision to allow companies to claim North Sea oil drilling rights with little money down, Metcalfe creates Prospecta Oil, a paper company designed to look good and bring in investors, to be left hanging out to dry when the bottom drops out. Metcalfe&#x27;s agents hire David Kesler, a Harvard MBA who talks up the company to the four protagonists: Stephen Bradley, an American professor at the University of Oxford; Dr Robin Oakley, a Harley Street doctor; Jean-Pierre Lamanns, a French art dealer with a gallery in London; and James Brigsley, heir to an earldom.

They each buy Prospecta stock and Metcalfe (indirectly) sells out at the top of the market. The stock crashes, and the four are left with major losses.
But Metcalfe has cheated the wrong men. Bradley learns of Metcalfe&#x27;s responsibility; discovering that there is no legal recourse, he organizes the four to steal the money back, using Harvey&#x27;s interests and weaknesses. All four are to come up with plans, and three quickly do. James, however, is unable to. He is more successful at courting Anne Summerton, an American model.

Jean-Pierre is successful at getting Harvey to buy a fake Van Gogh painting — he has always wanted one. When Harvey heads to Monte Carlo on vacation, a pill in his drink at the Casino causes severe abdominal pain which is made to look like a gallstone, and Robin operates, though barely breaking the skin, and collects a large bill. Stephen impersonates an Oxford official, as do the others, and gets Harvey to think he is getting an honorary degree in exchange for a contribution. James, though unable to come up with a plan of his own, has been crucial to the success of the others&#x27; plans — and when he meets Anne&#x27;s father, he learns that he is none other than Harvey.

James instructs the others to execute a complex financial fraud, and flies them to Boston for the wedding as ushers, though not giving formal invitations. They learn who the bride&#x27;s father is. The wedding cheque from Harvey, plus ransacking Harvey&#x27;s greenhouses for wedding flowers, reduces the million dollar debt to $1.24, though Stephen sulks on the plane home about the missing money.

They land in London to learn that a new BP oil field has been discovered next to Prospecta Oil&#x27;s tract, sending Prospecta shares to record highs. They now have the stolen million back, and the shares are worth well over a million. Stephen proposes they figure out how to give the stolen million back.

== Adaptations ==
Don Sharp said he worked on a version of the book in the 1970s but at that stage there was confusion about who had the rights.

In 1990 the book was adapted as a four-hour, two-part mini-series, directed by Clive Donner with Ed Asner as Harvey Metcalfe, Ed Begley Jr. as Stephen Bradley, François-Éric Gendron as Jean-Pierre Lamanns, Brian Protheroe as James Brigsley and Nicholas Jones as Dr. Robin Oakley, and also starring Jenny Agutter and Maryam d&#x27;Abo.

A text adventure game adaption based on the book was developed and published by Domark, and released in 1987 for the Amstrad CPC, Atari XL, BBC Micro, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers.

<text>Almandine (), also known as almandite, is a species of mineral belonging to the garnet group. The name is a corruption of alabandicus, which is the name applied by Pliny the Elder to a stone found or worked at Alabanda, a town in Caria in Asia Minor. Almandine is an iron alumina garnet, of deep red color, inclining to purple. It is frequently cut with a convex face, or en cabochon, and is then known as carbuncle. Viewed through the spectroscope in a strong light, it generally shows three characteristic absorption bands.

Almandine is one end-member of a mineral solid solution series, with the other end member being the garnet pyrope. The almandine crystal formula is: Fe3Al2(SiO4)3. Magnesium substitutes for the iron with increasingly pyrope-rich composition.

Almandine, , is the ferrous iron end member of the class of garnet minerals representing an important group of rock-forming silicates, which are the main constituents of the Earth&#x27;s crust, upper mantle and transition zone. Almandine crystallizes in the cubic space group &quot;I&quot;ad, with unit-cell parameter &quot;a&quot; ≈ 11.512 Å at 100 K.

Almandine is antiferromagnetic with the Néel temperature of 7.5 K. It contains two equivalent magnetic sublattices.

==Occurrence==

Almandine occurs rather abundantly in the gem gravels of Sri Lanka, whence it has sometimes been called &quot;Ceylon ruby&quot;. When the color inclines to a violet tint, the stone is often called Syriam garnet, a name said to be taken from Syriam, an ancient town of Pegu (now part of Myanmar). Large deposits of fine almandine-garnets were found, some years ago, in the Northern Territory of Australia, and were at first taken for rubies and thus they were known in trade for some time afterwards as Australian rubies.

Almandine is widely distributed. Fine rhombic dodecahedra occur in the schistose rocks of the Zillertal, in Tyrol, and are sometimes cut and polished. An almandine in which the ferrous oxide is replaced partly by magnesia is found at Luisenfeld in German East Africa. In the United States there are many localities which yield almandine. Fine crystals of almandine embedded in mica-schist occur near Wrangell in Alaska. The coarse varieties of almandine are often crushed for use as an abrasive agent.

==Cultural significance==
Connecticut has designated almandine garnet as its state gemstone.

<text>Don Juan Tenorio: Drama religioso-fantástico en dos partes (Don Juan Tenorio: Religious-Fantasy Drama in Two Parts) is a play written in 1844 by José Zorrilla. It is the more romantic of the two principal Spanish-language literary interpretations of the legend of Don Juan. The other is the 1630 &quot;El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra&quot; (The Trickster of Seville and the Guest of Stone), which is attributed to Tirso de Molina. &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; owes a great deal to this earlier version, as recognized by Zorrilla himself in 1880 in his &quot;Recuerdos del tiempo viejo&quot; (Memories of the Old Times), although the author confuses de Molina with another writer of the same era, Agustín Moreto.

==Plot==

===First part===

In the first part of the drama, the protagonist is still the demonic rake described by de Molina (he is called a demon and even Satan himself on more than one occasion). The story begins with Don Juan meeting Don Luis in a crowded wine shop in Seville so that the two can find out which of them has won the bet that they made one year ago: each expected himself to be able to conquer more women and kill more men than the other. Naturally, Don Juan wins on both counts. People in the crowd ask him if he is not afraid that someday there will be consequences for his actions, but Don Juan replies that he only thinks about the present.

It is then revealed that both &quot;caballeros&quot; have gotten engaged since they last met, Don Luis to Doña Ana de Pantoja and Don Juan to Doña Inés de Ulloa. Don Luis, his pride hurt, admits that Don Juan has slept with every woman on the social ladder from princess to pauper, but is lacking one conquest: a novice about to take her holy vows. Don Juan agrees to the new bet and doubles it by saying that he will seduce a novice and an engaged woman, boasting that he only needs six days to complete the task with Don Luis&#x27;s fiancée as one of the intended conquests.

At this point, Don Gonzalo, Don Juan&#x27;s future father-in-law, who has been sitting in a corner during this entire exchange, declares that Don Juan will never come near his daughter and the wedding is off. Don Juan laughs and tells the man that he will either give Doña Inés to him, or he will take her. He now has the second part of the bet concreted with Doña Inés set to take her vows.

In following scenes, Don Juan manages, through charisma, luck and bribery, to fulfill both terms of the bet in less than one night. However, he does not seduce the saintly Doña Inés; he just takes her from the convent where she had been cloistered and brings her to his mansion outside the city. There is a very tender love scene in which each professes to love the other, and it seems that, for once, Don Juan does feel something more than lust for Doña Inés.

Unfortunately, don Luis arrives to demand a duel with don Juan for having seduced doña Ana while pretending to be her fiance. Before they can fight, don Gonzalo shows up with the town guardsmen and accuses don Juan of kidnapping and seducing his daughter. Don Juan kneels and begs don Gonzalo to let him marry doña Inés, saying he worships her and would do anything for her. Don Luis and don Gonzalo mock him for his perceived cowardice and continue to demand his life. Don Juan declares that, since they have rejected him in his attempts to become a good person, he will go on being a devil, and he shoots don Gonzalo, stabs don Luis in a duel, and flees the country, abandoning the now fatherless doña Inés.

===Second part===

The second part begins after 5 years have passed. Don Juan returns to Seville. Upon coming to the place where his father&#x27;s mansion used to be which was turned into a pantheon, he discovers that the building was torn down and a cemetery built in its place. Lifelike statues of don Gonzalo, don Luis, and doña Inés stand over the tombs. The sculptor, who has just finished his work when don Juan arrives, tells him that don Diego Tenorio, don Juan&#x27;s father, had disowned his son and used his inheritance to build this memorial to his victims. Don Juan also finds out that doña Inés died of sorrow not long after being abandoned.

The protagonist is clearly at least a bit repentant of what he has done, expressing regret to the statues and praying to doña Inés for forgiveness. As he prays, the statue of doña Inés comes to life and tells him that he only has one day to live, in which he must decide what his fate will be. Inés is speaking from Purgatory, having made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of don Juan&#x27;s. God therefore agreed that their two souls would be bound together eternally, so don Juan must choose either salvation or damnation for both himself and doña Inés.

Then, two of don Juan&#x27;s old friends, Centellas and Avellaneda, show up, and don Juan convinces himself that he hadn&#x27;t truly seen a ghost at all. In order to prove his bravado, he heretically invites don Gonzalo&#x27;s statue to dinner that evening. Don Juan goes on blaspheming against heaven and the dead throughout the following scenes, until don Gonzalo&#x27;s statue really does show up at supper. Don Juan manages to remain largely nonchalant, although both of his other guests pass out, as don Gonzalo tells him once more that his time is running out. 

When Avellaneda and Centellas wake up, don Juan accuses them of having contrived this show to make fun of him. Offended, they accuse him of having drugged their drinks to mock them, and they end up in a swordfight.

The third act of Part Two is difficult to describe definitely, in that various critics have interpreted it differently (see below). Don Juan is back in the cemetery, led there by Don Gonzalo&#x27;s ghost. Don Gonzalo&#x27;s tomb opens and reveals an hourglass that represents Don Juan&#x27;s life. It has almost run out, and Don Gonzalo says that Centellas already killed don Juan in the duel. He then takes Don Juan&#x27;s arm to lead him into Hell. Don Juan protests that he isn&#x27;t dead and reaches out to heaven for mercy. Doña Inés appears and redeems him, and the two go to Heaven together.

==Interpretation==
This don Juan shifts away from the moralistic theme of Tirso de Molina&#x27;s play. This carefree character is much more conflicted than Molina&#x27;s original and highlights the manner in which the values of the myth can be reinterpreted. Zorrilla&#x27;s play (and don Juan&#x27;s final repentance) is often understood as an assertion of the author&#x27;s conservativism and Catholic faith.

It has become a tradition of both Spanish and Mexican theater to perform &quot;el Tenorio&quot; on All Saints Day or its Mexican equivalent the Day of the Dead, so the play has been performed at least once every year for over a century. It is also one of the most lucrative plays in Spanish history. Unfortunately, the author did not benefit from his play&#x27;s success: not long after he finished writing it, Zorrilla sold the rights to the play, since he did not expect it to be much more successful than any of his other works. Aside from the price paid for the rights, Zorrilla never made any money from any of the productions. Later, he wrote biting criticisms of the work in an apparent attempt to get it discontinued long enough for him to revise it and market the second version himself. However, the ploy never succeeded.
This is Ruiz&#x27;s version of Don Juan, because he believed a story can never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending.

<text>Benjamin Robert Clark (August 5, 1939 – April 4, 2007) was an American film director and screenwriter. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was responsible for some of the most successful films in Canadian film history such as &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974), &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979), &quot;Tribute&quot; (1980), &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (1981), and &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983). He won a trio of Genie Awards (two Best Direction and one Best Screenplay) with two additional nominations.

==Early life and education==
Clark was born in New Orleans in 1939, but grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and later moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He grew up poor. His father died during his childhood and his mother was a barmaid. 

After attending Catawba College majoring in philosophy, Clark won a football scholarship to Hillsdale College in Michigan, where he played quarterback. Eventually he studied theater at the University of Miami, turning down offers to play professional football. He did briefly play semi-pro for the Fort Lauderdale Black Knights.

==Career==
Clark&#x27;s career began with &quot;She-Man: A Story of Fixation&quot; (1967), which was released with the exploitation documentary &quot;Queens at Heart&quot;. Clark then transitioned into the horror genre in the early 1970s. His first film, &quot;Children Shouldn&#x27;t Play with Dead Things&quot; (1972), was a blend of comedy and graphic horror.

Clark and his collaborator for this film, screenwriter and makeup artist Alan Ormsby, would revisit the zombie subgenre in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Deathdream&quot;, also known by its alternative title, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, a Vietnam War allegory that takes its cue from the classic short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;. The slasher film &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) was one of his most successful films in this period, and is remembered today as an influential precursor to the modern slasher film genre. Clark had moved to Canada, then a tax haven for Americans, and these &quot;Canuxploitation&quot; productions were small by Hollywood standards but made Clark a big fish in the small pond of the Canadian film industry of that era.

Clark executive-produced the moonshine movie &quot;Moonrunners&quot;, which was used as source material for the TV series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Clark later produced the 2000 TV movie &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood&quot;. Clark and others sued Warner Bros. over the studio&#x27;s 2005 movie &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, winning a $17.5 million settlement just prior to the movie&#x27;s release.

Turning toward more serious fare, Clark scored a critical success with the Sherlock Holmes film &quot;Murder by Decree&quot;, starring Christopher Plummer and James Mason, which won five Genie Awards including Best Achievement in Direction and Best Performance for both leads. He followed this with a movie of the Bernard Slade play &quot;Tribute&quot;, starring Jack Lemmon reprising his Broadway role, for which Lemmon was nominated for an Academy Award and 11 Genies including a win for Lemmon&#x27;s performance.

Clark returned to his B-movie roots, though, co-writing, producing, and directing &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, a longtime personal project. Clark had a detailed outline based on his own youth in Florida, which he dictated into a cassette recorder due to illness, and collaborator Roger Swaybill said of listening to the tapes, &quot;I became convinced that I was sharing in the birth of a major moment in movie history. It was the funniest film story I had ever heard.&quot; 

Though set in the United States, the film would go on to gross more than any other English-language Canadian film. The film was the third most successful release of 1982 and by the end of the film&#x27;s lengthy initial release, in 1983, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; had secured itself a spot, albeit short-lived, as one of the top-25 highest-grossing films of all time in the US. The film was (also briefly) the most successful comedy in film history. 

The overwhelming success of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; is credited as launching the genre of the teen sex comedy so prevalent throughout the 1980s, and which continued into the millennium in such films as the &quot;American Pie&quot; series. Clark wrote, produced, and directed the film&#x27;s first sequel, &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; (1983), which did not feature the title character, and introduced two new antagonists with perhaps greater relevance, a blustering fundamentalist preacher, and a sleazy local politician who cynically caters to his influence, while seducing a teenage girl. 

Clark refused involvement with a third film, &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;, which brought Porky and the sexual exploits of the cast back front and center as in the first installment, as well as bringing everything full-circle and bringing the gang&#x27;s high school rowdy escapades to a close.

He instead collaborated with Jean Shepherd on &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, which critic Leonard Maltin described as &quot;one of those rare movies you can say is perfect in every way&quot;. Although not a box-office smash in its theatrical release, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; would go on to become a perennial holiday favorite via repeated TV airings and home video. A joint effort at a sequel in 1994, &quot;My Summer Story&quot;, did not fare as well; Maltin said that the studio waited too long, and Clark was forced to recast almost the entire film. Three other film versions of the Parker family had been produced for television by PBS with Shepherd&#x27;s involvement during the late 1980s, also with a different cast, but without Clark&#x27;s participation.

Clark continued to stay active in the film industry until his death, with lower-budget fare mixed in with brief runs at higher targets. A &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic, speaking after his death, described his career as &quot;a very unusual mix of films&quot;, because he &quot;at times was a director-for-hire and would do films that, to say the least, aren&#x27;t stellar&quot;. Some of his last output included &quot;Baby Geniuses&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Clark was nominated twice for the Razzie Awards as &quot;Worst Director&quot;, for &quot;Rhinestone&quot; and &quot;&quot;. At the end of his life, he was working with Howard Stern on a remake of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, and, with &quot;Black Christmas&quot; having been remade, two of his other early horror films were slated for expensive remakes: &quot;Children Shouldn&#x27;t Play With Dead Things&quot; and &quot;Deathdream&quot;.

==Personal life==
Clark was divorced, and had two sons, Michael and Ariel.

==Death==
Clark and his younger son, Ariel Hanrath-Clark, 22, were killed in a head-on car crash on the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles on the morning of April 4, 2007. The crash occurred when an SUV crossed the median and struck Clark&#x27;s Infiniti I30, causing the closure of the highway for eight hours. Police determined that the SUV&#x27;s driver, Héctor Manuel Velázquez-Nava, had a blood alcohol level of three times the legal limit and was driving without a license. Velázquez-Nava was described by federal authorities as being in the U.S. illegally. The driver initially pleaded not guilty to two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter, but changed his plea to no contest in August, and was sentenced to six years in prison under the terms of a plea agreement on October 12, 2007.

<text>Thiazide () refers to both a class of sulfur-containing organic molecules and a class of diuretics based on the chemical structure of benzothiadiazine. The thiazide drug class was discovered and developed at Merck and Co. in the 1950s. The first approved drug of this class, chlorothiazide, was marketed under the trade name Diuril beginning in 1958. In most countries, thiazides are the least expensive antihypertensive drugs available.

Thiazide organic molecules are bi-cyclic structures that contain adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms on one ring. Confusion sometimes occurs because thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are referred to as thiazides despite not having the thiazide chemical structure. When used this way, &quot;thiazide&quot; refers to a drug which acts at the thiazide receptor. The thiazide receptor is a sodium-chloride transporter that pulls NaCl from the lumen in the distal convoluted tubule. Thiazide diuretics inhibit this receptor, causing the body to release NaCl and water into the lumen, thereby increasing the amount of urine produced each day. An example of a molecule that is chemically a thiazide but not used as a diuretic is methylchloroisothiazolinone, often found as an antimicrobial in cosmetics.

==Medical uses==
Thiazide diuretics are primarily used to treat the hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (swelling) caused by water overload as well as certain conditions related to unbalanced calcium metabolism.

=== Water balance ===

====Hypertension====
There are many causes of hypertension (high blood pressure), including advancing age, smoking and obesity. Sometimes the underlying cause of hypertension cannot be determined, resulting in a diagnosis of idiopathic hypertension. Regardless of the cause, someone may have very high hypertension without any initial symptoms. Uncontrolled hypertension will eventually cause damage to the heart, kidneys and eyes. Lifestyle changes, including reducing dietary salt, increasing exercise and losing weight can help to reduce blood pressure.

Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics have been in constant use since their introduction in 1958. Decades as a cornerstone of hypertension treatment show how well these drugs perform for most patients. Low-dose thiazides are tolerated as well as the other classes of medications for hypertension, including ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. In general, the thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics reduce the risk of death, stroke, heart attack, and heart failure due to hypertension.

Clinical practice guidelines regarding the use of thiazides vary by geographic region. Guidelines in the United States recommend thiazides as a first-line treatment for hypertension (JNC VIII). A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration specifically recommended that low-dose thiazides be used as the initial pharmacological therapy for high blood pressure. Low-dose thiazides are more effective at treating hypertension than beta blockers and are similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Thiazides are a recommended treatment for hypertension in Europe (ESC/ESH). Thiazides should be considered as initial treatment if the patient has a high risk of developing heart failure. Thiazides have also been replaced by ACE inhibitors in Australia due to the association between thaizide use and increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2.

==== Diabetes insipidus ====
Thiazides can be used to paradoxically decrease urine flow in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Thiazides may also be useful in treating hyponatremia (low blood sodium) in infants with central diabetes insipidus.

=== Calcium balance ===

==== Urinary stones ====
Thiazides are useful in treating kidney stones and bladder stones that result from hypercalciuria (high urine calcium levels). Thiazides increase the uptake of calcium in the distal tubules, to moderately reduce urinary calcium. Thiazides combined with potassium citrate, increased water intake and decreased dietary oxalate and sodium can slow or even reverse the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones. High-dose therapy with the thiazide-like diuretic indapamide can be used to treat idiopathic hypercalcinuria (high urine calcium with unknown cause).

==== Osteoporosis ====
Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) can be caused by a variety of conditions that reduce dietary calcium absorption, increase calcium excretion or both. Positive calcium balance occurs when calcium excretion is decreased and intake remains constant so that calcium is retained within the body. Higher levels of retained calcium are associated with increased bone mineral density and fewer fractures in individuals with osteoporosis. By a poorly understood mechanism, thiazides directly stimulate osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation, further slowing the course of osteoporosis.

==== Dent&#x27;s disease ====
Thiazides may be used to treat the symptoms of Dent&#x27;s disease, an X-linked genetic condition that results in electrolyte imbalance with repeated episodes of kidney stones. A case study of two brothers with the condition, two years of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduced the incidence of kidney stones and improved kidney function. The thiazide-like diuretic chlortalidone reduced urine calcium oxalate in seven of the eight males with inactivated CLCN5 gene that participated in the study. Inactivation of the CLCN5 gene causes Dent&#x27;s disease Type 1. The rare nature of Dent&#x27;s disease makes it difficult to coordinate large controlled studies, so most evidence for thiazide use is with too few patients to make broad recommendations possible. Long-term thiazide use may not be advisable due to the risk of significant adverse side effects.

=== Other uses ===
Bromine intoxication can be treated by giving intravenous saline with either thiazides or Loop diuretics.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include: 
* Hypotension
* Allergy to sulphur-containing medications
* Gout
* Kidney failure
* Lithium therapy
* Hypokalemia
* May worsen diabetes

Thiazides reduce the clearance of uric acid since they compete for the same transporter, and therefore raise the levels of uric acid in the blood. Hence, they are prescribed with caution in patients with gout or hyperuricemia.

Chronic administration of thiazides is associated with the increase of insulin resistance which can lead to hyperglycemia.

Thiazides cause loss of blood potassium, while conserving blood calcium.

Thiazides can decrease placental perfusion and adversely affect the fetus, so should be avoided in pregnancy.

==Adverse effects==
* Hypokalemia – Thiazide diuretics reduce potassium concentration in blood through two indirect mechanisms: inhibition of sodium-chloride symporter at distal convoluted tubule of a nephron and stimulation of aldosterone that activates Na+/K+-ATPase at collecting duct. Inhibition of sodium-chloride symporter increases availability of sodium and chloride in urine. When the urine reaches the collecting duct, the increase in sodium and chloride availability activates Na+/K+-ATPase, which increases the absorption of sodium and excretion of potassium into the urine. Long term administration of thiazide diuretics reduces total body blood volume. This activates the renin–angiotensin system, stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, thus activating Na+/K+-ATPase, increasing excretion of potassium in urine. Therefore, ACE inhibitor and thiazide combination is used to prevent hypokalemia.
* Hyperglycemia
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hyperuricemia 
* Hypercalcemia
* Hyponatremia
** According to a 2025 retrospective study patients who experience early hyponatremia after beginning thiazide diuretics have a higher risk of mortality compared to those with stable sodium levels. Researchers also found that these patients faced an increased likelihood of complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, ataxia, and hip fractures.
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypocalciuria
* Metabolic alkalosis

==Mechanism of action==

Thiazide diuretics control hypertension in part by inhibiting reabsorption of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys by blocking the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl− symporter. The term &quot;thiazide&quot; is also often used for drugs with a similar action that do not have the thiazide chemical structure, such as chlorthalidone, metolazone and indapamide. These agents are more properly termed thiazide-like diuretics.

Thiazide diuretics also increase calcium reabsorption at the distal tubule. By lowering the sodium concentration in the tubule epithelial cells, thiazides indirectly increase the activity of the basolateral Na+/Ca2+ antiporter to maintain intracellular Na+ level, facilitating Ca2+ to leave the epithelial cells into the renal interstitium. Thus, intracellular Ca2+ concentration is decreased, which allows more Ca2+ from the lumen of the tubules to enter epithelial cells via apical Ca2+-selective channels (TRPV5). In other words, less Ca2+ in the cell increases the driving force for reabsorption from the lumen.

Thiazides are also thought to increase the reabsorption of Ca2+ by a mechanism involving the reabsorption of sodium and calcium in the proximal tubule in response to sodium depletion. Some of this response is due to augmentation of the action of parathyroid hormone.

==Breastfeeding==
Thiazides pass into breast milk and can decrease the flow of breast milk. Thiazides have been associated with significant side effects in some nursing infants and should be administered to nursing mothers with caution.

==History==
The thiazide diuretics were developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s, and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Diuril in 1958. The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to &quot;the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension&quot; was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.

<doc id="1179753" wikidata="Q4496047" url="?curid=1179753" title="Harpurhey">
<text>Harpurhey ( ) is an inner-city suburb of Manchester, in Greater Manchester, England, three miles north east of the city centre. Historically in Lancashire, the population at the 2011 census was 17,652.

Areas of Harpurhey include Kingsbridge Estate, Barnes Green, Shiredale Estate and Baywood Estate.

==History==
Harpurhey is recorded in 1320 as &quot;Harpourhey&quot;, meaning &quot;hedged enclosure by a man called Harpour&quot;, who owned the area in the 14th century.

Harpurhey lies on both sides of Rochdale Road from Collyhurst to Blackley, extending westward to the Irk. In 1830, it was described as abounding in pleasant views, but by 2007 was described as the worst place in England.

==Governance==
Harpurhey was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Manchester, in 1866 Harpurhey became a separate civil parish. Harpurhey was included in the parliamentary borough of Manchester from its creation but was not taken into the municipal borough until 1885. On 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form North Manchester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 8380. Harpurhey is one of the most economically deprived areas within the Greater Manchester area.

Harpurhey is within the Blackley and Broughton constituency, which has been represented in the House of Commons by Labour MP Graham Stringer who was first elected to the old Manchester Blackley constituency in 1997. Before his election to Parliament, he was a councillor for Harpurhey from 1982, and leader of Manchester City Council from 1984.

;Councillors

The ward is represented on Manchester City Council by three Labour Party councillors: Pat Karney (Lab), Joanne Green (Lab) and Sandra Collins (Lab).
 indicates seat up for re-election.

==Geography==
Harpurhey is 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north east of Manchester city centre. To the north, Harpurhey is bordered by Blackley, to the west by Crumpsall, to the east by Moston and to the south by Collyhurst and Monsall.

==Landmarks==
The Edwardian swimming baths on Rochdale Road were built between 1909 and 1910 by Henry Price, Manchester&#x27;s first City Architect. Listed grade II in 1994, the baths closed to the public in 2001 after serious defects were discovered. The women&#x27;s pool hall and laundry have now been replaced by the MANCAT sixth form college and community library.

The Embassy Club on Rochdale Road was bought by Bernard Manning in 1959, before which it had been Harpurhey Temperance Billiard Hall.

Queen&#x27;s Park was one of Britains first municipal parks in 1846; designed and laid out by Joshua Major in 1845, the park was originally arranged around Hendham Hall, home of the Houghton family, which was demolished in 1884. The park incorporated a labyrinth, sheds and greenhouses, but by 1930 these had been removed. Today the park has a children&#x27;s play area, rose gardens and hosts a variety of community events.

==Transport==
Harpurhey is served by a number of bus services on the main Rochdale Road (A664) corridor, as well as non-radial services to and from Salford Shopping Precinct and Oldham. Services include First Greater Manchester 17, 18, 52, 53, 64, 162 and 163, and Stagecoach Manchester 112 and 118.

Manchester Metrolink light rail tram system has two stations close to Harpurhey, at Monsall and Central Park (North Manchester Business Park), which also borders Newton Heath.

==Religion==

There are a number churches in the district, including the Church of England Christ Church, built in 1838. St Stephen&#x27;s was founded in 1899 and closed in 1985, where is merged with Harpurhey United Church which became Harpurhey Community Church.

Other churches include Park View Christ the Vine and Deeper Life.

Harpurhey is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Church of England Diocese of Manchester.

Manchester General Cemetery in Harpurhey was founded in 1837 and is still open to existing grave-owners. Although now a municipal cemetery, it is believed that Harpurhey cemetery was originally a private undertaking taken over by the municipal authority in 1868. Harpurhey Cemetery became the final resting place of Hannah Beswick (in 1868), the Manchester Mummy. and Benjamin Brierley (1825–1896).

==Education==
Two schools in the area cater for children aged between 3-11: Manchester Communication Primary Academy and Oasis Academy Harper Mount,

<text>The scapolites (, &quot;rod&quot;, and , &quot;stone&quot;) are a group of rock-forming silicate minerals composed of aluminium, calcium, and sodium silicate with chlorine, carbonate and sulfate. The two endmembers are meionite () and marialite (). Silvialite is also a recognized member of the group.

==Properties==

The group is an isomorphous mixture of the meionite and marialite endmembers. The tetragonal crystals are hemihedral with parallel faces (like scheelite), and at times of considerable size. They are distinct and usually have the form of square columns, some cleavages parallel to the prism-faces. Crystals are usually white or greyish-white and opaque, though meionite is found as colorless glassy crystals in the ejected limestone blocks of Monte Somma, Vesuvius. The hardness is 5–6, and the specific gravity varies with the chemical composition between 2.7 (meionite) and 2.5 (marialite). The scapolites are especially liable to alteration by weathering processes, with the development of mica, kaolin, etc., and this is the cause of the usual opacity of the crystals. Owing to this alteration, and to the variations in composition, numerous varieties have been distinguished by special names. Scapolite is commonly a mineral of metamorphic origin, occurring usually in crystalline marbles, but also with pyroxene in schists and gneisses. The long slender prisms abundant in the crystalline marbles and schists in the Pyrenees are known as dipyre or couzeranite. Large crystals of common scapolite (wernerite) are found in the apatite deposits in the neighborhood of Bamble near Brevik in Norway, and have resulted from the alteration of the plagioclase of a gabbro.

== Scapolite bearing rocks ==
According to their genesis the scapolite rocks fall naturally into four groups.

===Limestones and contact metamorphic rocks===
The scapolite limestones and contact metamorphic rocks. As silicates rich in calcium, it is to be expected that these minerals will be found where impure limestones have been crystallized by contact with an igneous magma. Even marialite (the variety richest in soda) occurs in this association, being principally obtained in small crystals lining cavities in ejected blocks of crystalline limestone at Vesuvius and the craters of the Eifel in Germany. Scapolite and wernerite are far more common at the contacts of limestone with intrusive masses. The minerals that accompany them are calcite, epidote, vesuvianite, garnet, wollastonite, diopside and amphibole. The scapolites are colorless, flesh-colored, grey or greenish; occasionally they are nearly black from the presence of very small enclosures of graphitic material. They are not in very perfect crystals, though sometimes incomplete octagonal sections are visible; the tetragonal cleavage, strong double refraction and uniaxial interference figure distinguish them readily from other minerals. Commonly they weather to micaceous aggregate, but sometimes an isotropic substance of unknown nature is seen replacing them. In crystalline limestones and calc–silicate rocks they occur in small and usually inconspicuous grains mingled with the other components of the rock. Large, nearly idiomorphic crystals are sometimes found in argillaceous rocks (altered calcareous shales) that have suffered thermal metamorphism. In the Pyrenees there are extensive outcrops of limestone penetrated by igneous rocks described as ophites (varieties of diabase) and lherzolites (peridotites). At the contacts scapolite occurs in a great number of places, both in the limestones and in the calcareous shales that accompany them. In some of these rocks large crystals of one of the scapolite minerals (an inch or two in length) occur, usually as octagonal prisms with imperfect terminations. In others the mineral is found in small irregular grains. It is sometimes clear, but often crowded with minute enclosures of augite, tourmaline, biotite and other minerals, such as constitute the surrounding matrix. From these districts also a black variety is well known, filled with minute graphitic enclosures, often exceedingly small and rendering the mineral nearly opaque. The names couzeranite and dipyre are often given to this kind of scapolite. Apparently the presence of chlorine in small quantities, which may often be detected in limestones, to some extent determines the formation of the mineral.

===Mafic igneous rocks===
In many mafic igneous rocks, such as gabbro and diabase, scapolite replaces feldspar by a secondary or metasomatic process. Some Norwegian scapolite-gabbros (or diorite) examined microscopically furnish examples of every stage of the process. The chemical changes involved are really small, one of the most important being the assumption of a small amount of chlorine in the new molecule. Often the scapolite is seen spreading through the feldspar, portions being completely replaced, while others are still fresh and unaltered. The feldspar does not weather, but remains fresh, and the transformation resembles metamorphism rather than weathering. It is not a superficial process, but apparently takes place at some depth under pressure, and probably through the operation of solutions or vapours containing chlorides. The basic soda-lime feldspars (labradorite to anorthite) are those that undergo this type of alteration. Many instances of scapolitization have been described from the ophites (diabases) of the Pyrenees. In the unaltered state these are ophitic and consist of pyroxene enclosing lath-shaped plagioclase feldspars; the pyroxene is often changed to uralite. When the feldspar is replaced by scapolite the new mineral is fresh and clear, enclosing often small grains of hornblende. Extensive recrystallization often goes on, and the ultimate product is a spotted rock with white rounded patches of scapolite surrounded by granular aggregates of clear green hornblende: in fact the original structure disappears.

===Scapolite-hornblende rocks===
In Norway scapolite-hornblende rocks have long been known at Ødegården and other localities. They have been called spotted gabbros, but usually do not contain feldspar, the white spots being entirely scapolite while the dark matrix enveloping them is an aggregate of green or brownish hornblende. In many features they bear a close resemblance to the scapolitized ophites of the Pyrenees. It has been suggested that the conversion of their original feldspar (for there can be no doubt that they were once gabbros, consisting of plagioclase and pyroxene) into scapolite is due to the percolation of chloride solutions along lines of weakness, or planes of solubility, filling cavities etched in the substance of the mineral. Subsequently the chlorides were absorbed, and the feldspar was transformed into scapolite. But it is found that in these gabbros there are veins of a chlorine-bearing apatite, which must have been deposited by gases or fluids ascending from below. This suggests that a pneumatolytic process has been at work, similar to that by which, around intrusions of granite, veins rich in tourmaline have been formed, and the surrounding rocks at the same time permeated by that mineral. In the composition of the active gases a striking difference is shown, for those that emanate from the granites are mainly fluorine and boron, while those from the gabbro are principally chlorine and phosphorus. In one case the feldspar is replaced by quartz and white mica (in greisen) or quartz and tourmaline (in schorl rocks); in the other case scapolite is the principal new product. The analogy is a very close one, and this theory receives much support from the fact that in Canada (at various places in Ottawa and Ontario) there are numerous valuable apatite vein deposits. They lie in basic rocks such as gabbro and pyroxenite, and these in the neighborhood of the veins have been extensively scapolitized, like the spotted gabbros of Norway.

===Metamorphic rocks of gneissose character===
In many parts of the world metamorphic rocks of gneissose character occur containing scapolite as an essential constituent. Their origin is often obscure, but it is probable that they are of two kinds. One series is essentially igneous (orthogneisses); usually they contain pale green pyroxene, a variable amount of feldspar, sphene, and iron oxides. Quartz, rutile, green hornblende and biotite are often present, while garnet occurs sometimes; hypersthene is rare. They occur along with other types of pyroxene gneiss, hornblende gneiss, amphibolites, etc. In many of them there is no reason to doubt that the scapolite is a primary mineral. Other scapolite gneisses equally metamorphic in aspect and structure appear to be sedimentary rocks. Many of them contain calcite or are very rich in calc-silicates (wollastonite, diopside, etc.), which suggests that they were originally impure limestones. The frequent association of this type with graphitic-schists and andalusite-schists makes this correlation in every way probable. Biotite is a common mineral in these rocks, which often contain also much quartz and alkali feldspar.

<text>The Mano River Union (MRU) is an international association initially established between Liberia and Sierra Leone by the 3 October 1973 Mano River Declaration. It is named for the Mano River which begins in the Guinea highlands and forms a border between Liberia and Sierra Leone. On 25 October 1980, Guinea joined the union.

The goal of the Union was to &quot;accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural advancement of our two countries ... by active collaboration and mutual assistance in matters of common interest in economic, social, technical, scientific and administrative fields&quot;. However, due to internal conflicts within the two original MRU countries (the Sierra Leone Civil War [1991-2002] and the First [1989-1997] and Second Liberian Civil Wars [1999-2003]), these objectives could not be achieved. The staff numbered 600 in 1986, but was down to 300 in 1993, then to 120, and 48 in 2000.

On 20 May 2004, the Union was reactivated at a summit of the three leaders of the Mano River Union states: Presidents Lansana Conté of Guinea and Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Chairman Gyude Bryant of Liberia. On 15 May 2008, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire agreed to join the union.

==Organizational structure==
The MRU is run by a secretariat, headed by a Secretary-General. Ambassador Simeon M-B. Harrison is the current Secretary-General of the Mano River Union. He became the 10th Secretary General. He replaced Madam Maria G. Harrison in May 2024. When Secretary-General Habib Diallo was killed in a car crash in 2011, his successor was the first woman to hold that office: Dr Saran Daraba Kaba. The Mano River Union Secretariat is based in Freetown, Sierra Leone, with offices in Conakry, Guinea and Monrovia, Liberia. In April 2016 the Union announced plans to form a Mano River Union Parliament, where legislators from the four member states will work to coordinate national legislation on matters of regional importance. To date this idea has been shelved as the cost and the structure of another parliamentary body whose relevance remains to be appreciated.

==Secretaries-General of the MRU==
* Dr. Cyril A. Bright, Liberia (1974–1978)
* T. Ernest Eastman, Liberia (1978–1983)
* Dr. Augustus F. Caine, Liberia (1983–1987)

<text>The West Lancashire Light Railway (WLLR) is a narrow gauge railway that operates at Hesketh Bank, situated between Preston and Southport in North West England. The distance between the stations on the railway is , though track extends eastwards beyond Delph station on ledge above the old clay pit which is too narrow to contain a run round loop. An extension of up to , running along the north bank of the fishing lake has been proposed. The railway has seven steam locomotives, three of which are in operating condition; two are currently being rebuilt and another is on static display. There are also two electric locomotives and many IC locomotives.

== History ==


The West Lancashire Light Railway was started in 1967, by six railway enthusiast schoolboys from the Hesketh Bank area. They wanted to save the narrow gauge railway equipment which was disappearing from local industries. They leased a strip of land above the clay pits at Alty&#x27;s Brickworks and started laying track using rails from the former clay tramways and rough timbers as sleepers.

Two Ruston and Hornsby diesel locomotives were acquired from Burscough Brick &amp; Tile Co. one with a 13 hp engine, the other a 20 hp model, they were respectively named &quot;Clwyd&quot; and &quot;Tawd&quot;. &quot;Clwyd&quot; was the first locomotive to run on the railway in 1969. These two locos were soon joined by more industrial diesels and the first home-built items of rolling stock.

At first, trains were operated on a &quot;travel at your own risk&quot; basis. The first formal timetable was issued in 1971.

In 1970, the railway acquired an incomplete set of parts of 1903 Quarry Hunslet steam locomotive &quot;Irish Mail&quot;, from Dinorwic slate quarry in North Wales. The major missing component was a boiler. Members of the WLLR retrieved the remains of Quarry Hunslet &quot;Alice&quot; from one of the upper levels of Dinorwic. Alice&#x27;s boiler was retained at the WLLR and the rest sold to the Bala Lake Railway. Over the next decade the railway re-assembled &quot;Irish Mail&quot; and the locomotive was steamed for the first time in 1980.

The running line slowly grew in length until it ran from Becconsall to a station known as Asland, which is no longer the far terminus of the line. The line in its present form runs from Becconsall to Delph, with the original track to Asland running on from Delph but not suitable for running engines.

In 2015, the WLLR hosted a gala to celebrate the 100th. anniversary of its Joffre class Kerr Stuart locomotive. A second Joffre class locomotive, No. 3014, attended from Apedale Valley Light Railway. This was the first time that two WWI-era Joffre locomotives had been in steam together in preservation.

The railway is twinned with the in France.

== Facilities ==

The railway&#x27;s sheds and workshops are situated at Becconsall station. The first shed was built by the members using cast-off bricks from Alty&#x27;s. This original workshop has been much added to over the years and the equipment in this workshop allows most of the work on restoring a steam locomotive to be undertaken, excluding boiler construction. Facilities for visitors have also been built at Becconsall.

==Operations==

The WLLR is open to the public on Sundays and Bank Holidays from Easter to the end of October, also on some other days during school holidays. Passengers can ride in semi-open coaches which have been built by the railway&#x27;s volunteers. Gala weekends are also organised, when visiting steam locomotives can be seen in operation. Other events include Easter Egg Hunt, Teddy Bears&#x27; Day, Friendly Engines Day, Strawberries and Steam, Halloween, Princess and Pirates Day, Pumpkin Express, Volunteers Day, Children in Need, and Santa Specials.

&#x27;Drive an Engine&#x27; days can be arranged for individuals or small groups to learn how to operate a steam engine. Bookings can also be taken for birthday parties (and other types of celebration) and for visits by schools, colleges, clubs and societies.

== Rolling stock ==

===Steam locomotives===
===Internal combustion locomotives===

===Electric Locomotives===
=== Wagons ===
The WLLR and its members own a variety of goods wagons obtained from several UK industrial narrow gauge railways, including tipper sand wagons from Pilkington Brothers sandfields in the Rainford and Bickerstaffe areas.

<doc id="1179782" wikidata="Q6783963" url="?curid=1179782" title="MassEquality">
<text>MassEquality is a Boston-based organization that seeks to promote LGBT rights in the U.S. Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It supported the implementation of &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s 2003 decision that legalized same-sex marriage, and opposed efforts to adopt an amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution seeking to limit the impact of or annul the ruling.

The coalition was formed in the late 1990s in response to the first attempts in the Massachusetts state legislature to pass a &quot;defense of marriage act&quot; that would have prohibited the recognition of same-sex marriage. MassEquality was formally incorporated in late 2001 as a 501(c)4 advocacy organization, though it operated without staff until after the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision.

The organization is a member of the Equality Federation.

==Constitutional amendment advocacy==
The &quot;Goodridge&quot; ruling reignited attempts to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to ban civil recognition of same-sex marriage. In late 2003, the coalition of organizations that formed the Steering Committee for MassEquality hired its first staffer, Campaign Coordinator Marty Rouse. Rouse, an experienced political operative who had helped members of the Vermont legislature recover form election losses they suffered as a consequence of supporting civil union legislation, quickly implemented a campaign to marshal the coalition&#x27;s resources and build a field operation to bolster the LGBTQ movement&#x27;s legislative lobbying.

In the wake of the &quot;Goodridge&quot; ruling, legislative debate on a &quot;defense of marriage&quot; amendment in Massachusetts was intense. The debate, conducted in a joint session of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate, a Constitutional Convention that spanned four days over nearly two months, was carried live on C-SPAN. During that time, MassEquality identified and mobilized supporters of same-sex marriage in an attempt to defeat the proposed constitutional amendment.

On March 29, 2004, the Massachusetts legislature passed by a five-vote margin a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage and provide civil unions for same-sex couples. This amendment, called the Travaglini-Lees amendment, needed to win a majority of the votes in a second constitutional convention before being put to a popular vote. It was defeated in a joint session of the legislature on September 29, 2005, by a vote of 39-157, due largely to increased public support for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and to victories by several legislative candidates supportive of same-sex marriage backed by MassEquality.

Opponents of same-sex marriage then launched a new initiative to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. This new amendment sought to ban same-sex marriage without creating an alternative institution for same-sex couples. This amendment was brought as an initiative petition, requiring collection of a certain number of voters&#x27; signatures, followed by a vote of one-quarter of legislators meeting in joint session in both the 2005-2006 legislative session and the 2007-2008 session. The Massachusetts legislature adopted this amendment just before its 2005-2006 session ended, but defeated it during its 2007-2008 session.

==Other activities==
Following the defeat of the amendment, MassEquality expanded its mission to work for equal rights and opportunities for all LGBT people from cradle to grave—in schools, in marriage and family life, at work and in retirement. Since that expansion, it helped pass a statewide anti-bullying law and secured an executive order from Governor Deval Patrick prohibiting discrimination against transgender people in state agencies and state contracts. Kara Suffredini, an attorney with over a decade of LGBT policy and movement experience, was appointed executive director in 2010. 

In 2021, MassEquality moved to Worcester, to better support its shift in focus to prioritize local organizing and education, in pursuit of lived equality, statewide, in addition to its traditional lobbying and electoral activities. 

==Parade invitation==
On February 28, 2014, following pressure on the part of Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, the organizers of South Boston&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, which had banned open participation by gay organizations for 20 years and in 1995 won a Supreme Court case that supported their stance, announced that MassEquality would be welcome to participate in the parade. It set conditions that MassEquality&#x27;s marchers not wear shirts or carry signs that display the word &quot;gay&quot; or refer to sexual orientation. One organizer said: &quot;They can march under the MassEquality banner. We&#x27;d be happy to have them here. And we’d be proud to have them here. Everybody knows who MassEquality is.&quot; MassEquality leaders welcomed the opportunity to discuss the question with parade organizers directly and said: &quot;MassEquality has not accepted any invitation to march, and will only consider accepting an invitation that allows LGBT people to march openly... LGBT people should not have to silence who they are to celebrate other parts of their identities.&quot;

* Deadly Duck, eponymous character of the Atari 2600 video game &quot;Deadly Duck&quot; (1982).
* The Atari 2600 game &quot;Duck Attack!&quot; (2010) features a mallard named Bruce, plus other ducks named Mandy, Pat, Groucho, and Clarice.
* The Mad Duck, one of the enemies in &quot;EarthBound&quot;.
* Prince Drake from &quot;Crazy Drake&quot;, 2D platformer released in 1996 for IBM PC compatibles.
* John Mallard, announcer from &quot;Duck Game&quot; (2015). All other characters in the game are anthropomorphic ducks, but they are unnamed.
* Some of the villagers in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series are ducks, including Bill, Deena, Derwin, Drake, Freckles, Fruity, Gloria, Joey, Ketchup, Maelle, Mallary, Miranda, Molly, Pate, Pompom, Quillson, Scoot, Shinabiru, and Weber. Three of them only appeared in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori e+&quot; (also known as &quot;Animal Forest e+&quot;): Fruity, Ketchup, and Shinabiru. However, most of the other duck characters have been featured in that game as well (except Drake, Gloria, Molly, and Quillson) and almost all of the duck characters that were in that game were also in the original &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; game (except Miranda).
* The NES video game &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; (1984) has unnamed ducks as an integral part of gameplay. By pointing the NES Zapper gun peripheral at the TV, the gamer shoots down ducks that fly across the screen. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, the lone dog and a single, individualized duck from Duck Hunt appears together as a playable character. In the European version they are referred to as Duck Hunt Duo, and in the North American/Japanese versions eponymously as &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;. This particular duck has thus since been referred to as &quot;Duck Hunt Duck&quot;.
* In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, a duck provides the significant purpose of carrying the protagonist, Link, to 1 of 8 locations spread throughout the game world. This duck is unnamed, but due to being the pet of the Flute Boy and referred to in game only as a bird, it is referred to by fans as the Flute Boy&#x27;s Bird.
* Several Pokémon species seem to be inspired by ducks, such as Farfetch&#x27;d, Psyduck, Ducklett and Quaxly.

<text>Private Eric Anderson (15 September 19156 April 1943) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born in Fagley in Bradford, West Yorkshire, the only son of George and Mary Anderson. He became a driver for a building and contracting firm in Idle, West Yorkshire.

==Service==
Anderson was 27 years old, and a Private in the 5th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 April 1943 on the Wadi Akarit, Tunisia, when a company of the East Yorkshire Regiment had to withdraw temporarily behind the crest of a hill, Private Anderson, a stretcher-bearer, went forward alone through heavy fire to rescue the wounded. Three times he brought in wounded comrades, and was rendering first aid to a fourth when he was mortally wounded.

He is buried in Sfax War Cemetery in southern Tunisia.
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Prince of Wales Own Regiment of Yorkshire Museum in York.

<text>Cataract surgery, also called lens replacement surgery, is the removal of the natural lens of the eye that has developed a cataract, an opaque or cloudy area. The eye&#x27;s natural lens is usually replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) implant.

Over time, metabolic changes of the crystalline lens fibres lead to the development of a cataract, causing impairment or loss of vision. Some infants are born with congenital cataracts, and environmental factors may lead to cataract formation. Early symptoms may include strong glare from lights and small light sources at night and reduced visual acuity at low light levels.

During cataract surgery, the cloudy natural lens is removed from the posterior chamber, either by emulsification in place or by cutting it out. An IOL is usually implanted in its place (PCIOL), or less frequently in front of the chamber, to restore useful focus. Cataract surgery is generally performed by an ophthalmologist in an out-patient setting at a surgical centre or hospital. Local anaesthesia is normally used; the procedure is usually quick and causes little or no pain and minor discomfort. Recovery sufficient for most daily activities usually takes place in days, and full recovery takes about a month.

Well over 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, and there is a low complication rate. Day care, high-volume, minimally invasive, small-incision phacoemulsification with quick post-operative recovery has become the standard of care in cataract surgery in the developed world. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), which is considerably more economical in time, capital equipment, and consumables, and provides comparable results, is popular in the developing world. Both procedures have a low risk of serious complications, and are the definitive treatment for vision impairment due to lens opacification.

==Uses==

Cataract surgery is the most common application of lens removal surgery, and is usually associated with lens replacement. It is used to remove the natural lens of the eye when it has developed a cataract, a cloudy area in the lens that causes visual impairment. Cataracts usually develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Early symptoms may include faded colours, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, sensitivity to glare from bright lights, and night blindness. Total blindness is the end result. The procedure is normally elective, but lens removal may be part of trauma surgery in cases where the eye is severely injured. The lens is usually replaced by an intraocular implant when this is reasonably practicable, as removal of the lens also removes the ability of the eye to focus at any distance.
Cataracts most commonly occur due to aging, but may also be caused by trauma or radiation exposure, be present since birth, or may develop as a complication of eye surgery intended to solve other health problems. Cataracts form when clumps of proteins or yellow-brown pigment accumulate in the lens, which reduces transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts can be diagnosed via an eye examination.
Early symptoms of cataract may be improved by wearing appropriate glasses; if this does not help, cataract surgery is the only effective treatment. Surgery with implants generally results in better vision and an improved quality of life: however, the procedure is not readily available in many countries.

==Techniques==


Two main classes of cataract surgical procedures are currently in common use throughout the world: phacoemulsification, and extracapsular cataract extraction. Intracapsular cataract extraction has been superseded where the facilities for surgery under a microscope are available except for cases where the lens capsule cannot be retained, and couching is no longer used in mainstream medicine.

In phacoemulsification (phaco), the natural lens is fragmented by an ultrasonic probe and removed by suction. A more recent and less common variation of this, femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification surgery, uses a laser to make the corneal incision, execute the capsulotomy, which provides access to the lens, and initiate lens fragmentation, which reduces energy requirements for phacoemulsification. The small incision size used in phacoemulsification generally allows for sutureless incision closure.

In (ECCE), and its variation manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), the lens is removed from its capsule and manually extracted from the eye, either whole or after being split into a small number of substantial pieces. The basic version of ECCE uses a larger incision of and usually requires stitches. This requirement led to the variation known as MSICS, which does not usually need stitches as the incision should be self sealing under internal pressure due to its geometry.

Comparative trials of MSICS against phaco in dense cataracts have found no significant difference in outcomes, although MSICS had shorter operating times and significantly lower costs. MSICS has been prioritized as the method of choice in developing countries, because it provides high-quality outcomes with less surgically-induced astigmatism than standard ECCE, no suture-related problems, quick rehabilitation, and fewer post-operative visits. MSICS is generally easy and fast to learn for the surgeon, cost-effective and applicable to almost all types of cataract. ECCE using a large incision has largely become a contingency procedure to deal with complications during surgery and for managing cataracts expected to be difficult extractions.

In most surgeries, an IOL is inserted. Foldable lenses are generally used for the phaco incision, while non-foldable lenses can be placed through the larger extracapsular incision.

 (ICCE) is the removal of the lens and the surrounding lens capsule in one piece. The procedure has a relatively high rate of complications in comparison to techniques in which the capsule is retained in place, due to the large incision required, pressure placed on the vitreous body when removing the encapsulated lens, and the removal of the barrier between the chambers of the eye, allowing easier migration of vitreous into the anterior chamber. It has therefore been largely superseded and is rarely performed in countries where operating microscopes and high-technology equipment are readily available. After lens removal by ICCE, an intraocular lens implant can be placed in either the anterior chamber or sutured into the ciliary sulcus. Cryoextraction is a technique used in ICCE to extract the lens using a cryoprobe, the refrigerated tip of which adheres to the tissue of the lens at the contact point by freezing with a cryogenic substance such as liquid nitrogen, facilitating its removal. Cryoextraction may still be used for the removal of subluxated (partially dislocated) lenses.

Couching is the earliest documented form of cataract surgery. It involves dislodging the lens of the eye, removing the cataract from the optical axis, but leaving it inside the eye. The lens is not replaced and the eye cannot focus at any distance.

Phacoemulsification is the most commonly performed cataract procedure in the developed world, but the high capital and maintenance costs of a phacoemulsification machine and of the associated disposable equipment, have made ECCE and MSICS the most commonly performed procedures in developing countries. Cataract surgery is commonly done as an out-patient or day-care procedure, which is less expensive than hospitalisation and an overnight stay, and day surgery has similar medical outcomes.

==Pre-operative evaluation==
An eye examination or pre-operative evaluation is done to confirm the presence of a cataract and to determine the patient&#x27;s suitability for surgery:

* The degree of reduction of vision due largely to the cataract is evaluated. While the existence of other sight-threatening diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma, does not preclude cataract surgery, less improvement may be expected in their presence.
* In cases of uncontrolled glaucoma, a combined cataract-glaucoma procedure (phaco-trabeculectomy) can be planned and performed.
* The pupil is checked for dilation using eyedrops; if they do not provide a satisfactory result, injected intracameral mydriatics have been shown to be safe and effective for surgery and fast acting. If pharmacologic pupil dilation is insufficient, procedures for mechanical pupil dilatation may be needed during the surgery.
* People with retinal detachment may be scheduled for a combined vitreo-retinal procedure, along with IOL implantation.
* People taking tamsulosin (Flomax), a common drug for enlarged prostate, are prone to developing a surgical complication known as intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which requires appropriate management to avoid posterior capsule rupture.
* A Cochrane Review of three randomized clinical trials, including over 21,500 cataract surgeries, examined whether routine pre-operative medical testing resulted in a reduction of adverse events during surgery. Results showed performing pre-operative medical testing did not result in a reduction of risk of intra-operative or post-operative medical adverse events, compared to surgeries with no or limited pre-operative testing.
* Infants with congenital cataracts are more likely to have post-operative inflammation problems, and their eyes grow rapidly and unpredictably, making it challenging to select and fit a posterior chamber IOL in infants younger than seven months that will give satisfactory results later in childhood. A second surgery may be required later.

===Contraindications===
Contraindications to cataract surgery include cataracts that do not cause visual impairment and medical conditions that predict a high risk of unsatisfactory surgical outcomes. such as:
*Poor general health or a serious medical condition.
*Surgery will not provide better visual function.
*Advanced macular degeneration
*Detached retina.
*Advanced diabetes that has affected the retina.
*An infection of the eyes or nearby that could cause endophthalmitis, so should be treated before cataract surgery.
*The person does not want surgery.
*Functional vision can be provided by glasses or other visual aids which is sufficient for the person&#x27;s requirements.
*Corneal diseases such as glaucoma may be a relative contraindication.

=== Selection of intraocular lenses ===


After the removal of a cataract, an intraocular lens is usually implanted to replace the damaged natural lens. A foldable IOL may be implanted through a incision, whereas a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) lens requires a larger cut. Foldable IOLs are made of silicone, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic acrylic material of appropriate refractive power and are inserted with a special tool. The IOL is inserted through the incision, usually into the capsular bag from which the cataract was removed (in-the-bag implantation). Sometimes, a sulcus implantation—in front of the capsular bag, but behind the iris—may be required because of posterior capsular tears or zonular dialysis (inadequate support for the capsular bag). This requires an IOL with different refractive power because of the placement further forward on the optical axis.

The appropriate refractive power of the IOL is selected, much like a spectacle or contact lens prescription, to provide the desired refractive outcome. Pre-operative measurements, including corneal curvature, axial length, and white-to-white measurements are used to estimate the required power of the IOL. These methods include several formulae and free online calculators which use similar input data. A history of LASIK surgery, which alters corneal curvature, requires different calculations to take this into account.

Monofocal IOLs provide accurately focused vision at one distance only; far, intermediate, or near. People who are fitted with these lenses may need to wear glasses or contact lenses while reading or using a computer. These lenses usually have uniform spherical curvature.

Other designs of multifocal intraocular lens that focus light from distant and near objects, working with similar effect to bifocal or trifocal eyeglasses, are also available. Pre-operative patient selection and good counselling is necessary to avoid unrealistic expectations and post-operative patient dissatisfaction, and possibly a requirement to replace the lens. Acceptability of these lenses has improved, and studies have shown good results in patients selected for expected compatibility.

Cataract surgery may be performed to correct vision problems on both eyes. If both eyes are suitable, people are usually advised to consider monovision. This procedure involves inserting an IOL providing near vision into one eye, while using one that provides distance vision for the other eye. Although most people can adjust to having monofocal IOLs with differing focal length, some cannot compensate and may experience blurred vision at both near and far distances. An IOL optimised for distance vision may be combined with an IOL that optimises intermediate vision, instead of near vision, as a variation of monovision.

One model of lens designed to change focus using the natural reflexes of the eye has two hinged struts on opposite edges, which displace the lens along the optical axis when an inward transverse force is applied to the haptic loops at the outer ends of the struts—the components transferring the movement of the contact points to the device—while recoiling when the same force is reduced. The lens is implanted in the eye&#x27;s lens capsule, where the contractions of the ciliary body, which would focus the eye with the natural lens, are used to focus the implant, instead.

IOLs used in correcting astigmatism have different curvature on two orthogonal axes, as on the surface of a torus: for this reason, they are called toric lenses. Intraoperative aberrometry can be used to assist the surgeon in toric lens placement and minimize astigmatic errors.

The first aspheric IOLs were developed in 2004; they have a flatter periphery than the middle of the lens, improving contrast sensitivity. The effectiveness of aspheric IOLs depends on a range of conditions and they may not always provide significant benefit.

The development of light-adjustable intraocular lens (approved by the FDA in 2017), further expanded options for patients with cataracts.

Some IOLs are able to absorb ultraviolet and high-energy blue light, thus mimicking the functions of the natural crystalline lens of the eye, which usually filters potentially harmful frequencies. A 2018 Cochrane review found there is unlikely to be a significant difference in distance vision between blue-filtering and plain lenses, and was unable to identify a difference in contrast sensitivity or colour discrimination.

The light-adjustable IOL was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. This type of IOL is implanted in the eye and then treated with ultraviolet light to alter the curvature of the lens before fixing it at the final strength.

In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to insert an additional lens over the already implanted one, also in the posterior capsule. This type of IOL placement is called &quot;piggyback&quot; IOLs and is usually considered when the visual outcome of the first implant is not optimal. In such cases, implanting another IOL over the existing one is considered safer than replacing the initial lens. This approach may also be used in people who need high degrees of vision correction.

Cost is an important aspect of these lenses. Although Medicare covers the cost of monofocal IOLs in the United States, people will have to pay the price difference if they choose more expensive lenses.

==Operation procedures==

===Preparation===
Preparation may begin three-to-seven days before surgery, with the pre-operative application of NSAIDs and antibiotic eyedrops. If the IOL is to be placed behind the iris, the pupil is dilated by using drops to help better visualise the cataract. Pupil-constricting drops are reserved for secondary implantation of the IOL in front of the iris, when the cataract has already been removed without primary IOL implantation.

The operation may occur on a stretcher or a reclining examination chair. The eyelids and surrounding skin are swabbed with a disinfectant, such as 10% povidone-iodine, and topical povidone-iodine is applied to the eye. The face is covered with a cloth or sheet with an opening for the operative eye. The eyelid is held open with a speculum to minimize blinking during surgery. Pain is usually minimal in properly anaesthetised eyes, though a pressure sensation and discomfort from the bright operating microscope light is common.

===Anaesthesia===
Most cataract operations are performed under local anaesthetic, allowing the patient to return home the same day. Lens and cataract procedures are commonly performed in an out-patient setting; in the United States, 99.9% of lens and cataract procedures were done in an out-patient setting by 2012.

Topical, sub-tenon, peribulbar, or retrobulbar local anaesthesia is generally used, usually causing little or no discomfort. Injections may be used to block regional nerves and prevent eye movement. Topical anaesthetics are most commonly used, placed on the globe of the eye as eyedrops (before surgery), or in the globe (during surgery). Oral or intravenous sedation to reduce anxiety may be combined with the local anaesthetic. General anaesthesia and retrobulbar blocks were historically used for intracapsular cataract surgery, and may be used for children and adults whose medical or psychiatric issues significantly affect their ability to remain still during the procedure.

===Phacoemulsification===
Phacoemulsification uses a machine with an ultrasonic handpiece with a titanium or surgical stainless steel tip, which vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency—commonly 40kHz—to emulsify the lens tissue, which is aspirated by a coaxial annular suction tube. A second instrument, which is sometimes called a &quot;cracker&quot; or &quot;chopper&quot;, may be used from a small side incision to break the hard cataract nucleus into smaller pieces, making emulsification and removal of the soft part of the lens around the nucleus easier. After phacoemulsification of the lens nucleus and cortical material is completed, an irrigation–aspiration (I-A) system is used to remove the remaining peripheral lens material. The procedure is done under a surgical microscope.

Femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification surgery is a more recent development which may have fewer adverse effects on the cornea and macula than manual phacoemulsification. The laser is used to make the corneal incision and the capsulotomy, which provides access to the lens, and initiate lens fragmentation, which reduces energy requirements for phacoemulsification. It provides high-precision, effective lens fragmentation at lower power levels and consequent good optical quality. However, as of 2022, the technique has not been shown to have significant visual, refractive, or safety benefits over manual phacoemulsification, and it has a higher cost.

Entry into the eye is made through a minimal tunnel incision near the edge of the cornea. The incision for cataract surgery has evolved along with the techniques for cataract removal and IOL placement. In phacoemulsification, the width depends on the requirements for IOL insertion. With foldable IOLs, it is often possible to use incisions smaller than . The shape, position, and size of the incision affect the capacity for self sealing, the tendency to induce astigmatism, and the surgeon&#x27;s ability to maneuvre instruments through the opening. A more-posterior incision simplifies wound closure and decreases induced astigmatism, but it is more likely to damage blood vessels nearby. One or two smaller side-port incisions at 60-to-90 degrees from the main incision may be needed to access the anterior chamber with additional instruments.

Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs), a class of clear, gel-like materials, are injected into the anterior chamber at the start of the procedure, to support, stabilize, and protect the eyeball, to help maintain eye shape and volume, and to distend the lens capsule during IOL implantation. Their consistency allows surgical instruments to move through them, although they do not flow and retain their shape under low shear stress. The OVD will also constrain lens fragments from drifting around in the chamber. OVDs are available in several formulations, which may be combined or used individually as best suits the procedure.

The lens is inside a capsule supported by the ciliary body, between the aqueous and vitreous, behind the opening in the iris. Capsulorhexis is the process of tearing a circular opening in the front membrane of the lens capsule to access the lens within. In phacoemulsification, an anterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is usually used to create a round, smooth-edged opening through which the surgeon can emulsify the lens nucleus, and then implant the intraocular lens.

The cataract&#x27;s outer (cortical) layer is then separated from the capsule by a gentle, continuous flow or pulsed dose of liquid from a cannula, which is injected under the anterior capsular flap, along the edge of the capsulorhexis opening, in a step called hydrodissection. In hydrodelineation, fluid is injected into the body of the lens through the cortex against the nucleus of the cataract, which separates the hardened nucleus from the softer cortex shell by flowing along the interface between them. As a result, the smaller hard nucleus can be more-easily emulsified. The posterior cortex serves as a buffer at this stage, protecting the posterior capsule membrane. The smaller size of the separated nucleus allows it to be broken up using shallower and less-peripheral grooving by the phaco tip, and produces smaller fragments after cracking or chopping. The posterior cortex also maintains the shape of the capsule through this stage, which reduces the risk of posterior capsule rupture.

After nuclear cracking or chopping (if needed), the cataract is reduced to small fragments using ultrasound which are simultaneously aspirated. The remaining lens cortex (outer layer of lens) material from the capsular bag is carefully aspirated, and if necessary, the remaining epithelial cells from the capsule are removed by capsular polishing. The folded intraocular replacement lens is implanted, usually into the remaining posterior capsule, and checked to see that it has unfolded and seated correctly. A toric IOL must also be aligned in the correct axis to counteract astigmatism.

===Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)===

Many of the steps followed during MSICS are similar, if not identical, to those for phacoemulsification; the main differences are related to the alternative method of incision and cataract extraction from the capsule and eye.

Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) is an evolution of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE); the lens is removed from the eye through a self-sealing tunnel wound through the sclera. A well-constructed scleral tunnel is held closed by internal pressure, is watertight, and does not require suturing. The wound is relatively smaller than the one in ECCE, but is still markedly larger than a phaco wound.

The small incision into the anterior chamber of the eye is made at or near the corneal limbus, where the cornea and sclera meet, either superior or temporal. Advantages of the smaller incision include use of few-to-no stitches and shortened recovery time. The MSICS incision is small in comparison with the earlier ECCE incision, but considerably larger than the one used in phacoemulsification. The precise geometry of the incision is important, as it affects the self-sealing of the wound and the amount of astigmatism induced by distortion of the cornea during healing. A sclerocorneal or scleral tunnel incision is commonly used, since it reduces the risk of induced astigmatism if suitably formed. A sclerocorneal tunnel, a three-phase incision, starts with a shallow incision perpendicular to the sclera, followed by an incision through the sclera and cornea approximately parallel to the outer surface, and then a beveled incision into the anterior chamber. This structure provides the self-sealing characteristic, because internal pressure presses together the faces of the incision. Bridle sutures may be used to help stabilize the eyeball during sclerocorneal tunnel incision, and during extraction of the nucleus and epinucleus through the tunnel.
The depth of the anterior chamber and position of the posterior capsule may be maintained during surgery by OVDs or an anterior chamber maintainer, which is an auxiliary cannula providing a sufficient flow of buffered saline solution (BSS) to maintain stability of the shape of the chamber and internal pressure. An anterior capsulotomy, is then done to open the front surface of the lens capsule for access to the lens. The continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis technique is often used, or can-opener capsulotomy or envelope capsulotomy. 
The lens may be divided into two or more pieces of similar size using a constricting loop, blades or other devices. The cataract lens or fragments are then removed from the capsule and anterior chamber using hydroexpression, viscoexpression, or more direct mechanical methods. Following cataract removal, an IOL is usually inserted into the posterior capsule. When the posterior membrane of the capsule is damaged, the IOL may be inserted into the ciliary sulcus, or a glued intraocular lens technique may be applied.

===Extracapsular cataract extraction===
 (ECCE), also known as manual extracapsular cataract extraction, is the removal of almost the entire natural lens in one piece, while most of the elastic lens capsule (posterior capsule) is left intact to allow implantation of an intraocular lens. The lens is manually removed through a incision in the cornea or sclera. Although it requires a larger incision and the use of stitches, this method may be preferable for very hard cataracts, which would require a relatively large ultrasonic energy input, which causes more heating, as well as in other situations in which phacoemulsification is problematic.

===Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency===
The most commonly used procedures are phacoemulsification and manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS). In either of these procedures, it can sometimes be necessary to convert to ECCE to deal with a problem better managed through a larger incision. This may occur in the event of posterior capsule rupture, zonular dehiscence, a dropped nucleus with a nuclear fragment more than half the size of the cataract, problematic capsulorhexis with a hard cataract, or a very dense cataract where the heat developed by phacoemulsification is likely to cause permanent damage to the cornea. Similarly, a change from MSICS to ECCE is appropriate whenever the nucleus is too large for the MSICS incision, as well as in cases where the nucleus is found to be deformed during MSICS on a nanophthalmic eye.

===Closing the wound===
After the IOL is inserted, OVDs that were injected to stabilize the anterior chamber, protecting the cornea from damage and distending the cataract&#x27;s capsule during IOL implantation, are removed from the eye to prevent post-operative viscoelastic glaucoma, a severe intra-ocular pressure increase. This is done via suction from the irrigation-aspiration instrument and replacement by buffered saline solution (BSS). Cohesive OVDs tend to adhere to themselves, a characteristic that makes their removal easier. Removal of OVDs from behind the implant reduces the risk and magnitude of post-operative pressure spikes or capsular distention. In the final step, the wound is sealed by increasing the pressure inside the globe with BSS, which presses the internal tissue against the external tissue of the incision, holding it closed. The surgeon will check whether the incision leaks fluid, because wound leakage increases the risk of penetration into the eye by microorganisms, thus predisposing it to endophthalmitis. If this does not achieve a satisfactory seal, a suture may be added. The wound is then hydrated, an antibiotic/steroid combination eyedrop is put in, and an eye-shield may be applied, sometimes supplemented with an eyepatch.

==Post-operative care==
The use of an eye patch may be indicated, usually for some hours after surgery and for a few days while sleeping. A topical corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is used to control inflammation, in combination with topical antibiotics to prevent infection in the post-operative phase. These are generally self-administered as eyedrops for a few weeks.

==Complications==
===During surgery===
, a tear in the posterior membrane of the natural lens capsule, is the most common complication during cataract surgery, with its rate ranging from 0.5% to 5.2%. In most cases the situation can be salvaged, though it may be necessary to modify the original plans for the placement, refractive strength, and type of IOL. Fragments of the nucleus can find their way through the tear into the vitreous chamber, and recovery of the fragments is not always desirable and is rarely successful. The rest of the fragments should generally be stabilised first, and vitreous should be prevented from entering the anterior chamber, and removed if it does. Removal of the fragments may be best referred to a vitreoretinal specialist. Surgical management of a rupture may involve the Intraocular lens scaffold procedure, anterior vitrectomy, and occasionally, alternative planning for implanting the IOL, either in the ciliary sulcus (the space between the iris and the ciliary body), in the anterior chamber in front of the iris, or less commonly, sutured to the sclera. Posterior capsule rupture can cause corneal oedema, cystoid macular oedema, and retention of lens fragments; it is also associated with a six-times increase in the risk of endophthalmitis and as much as a nineteen-times increase in the risk of retinal detachment. Risk factors for posterior capsule rupture include advanced age, female sex, small capsulorhexis, small pupil opening during surgery, high myopia, pseudoexfoliation, dense cataract nucleus, posterior polar cataract, history of preoperative trauma, previous treatment for retinal disease, poor patient cooperation, and surgical inexperience.

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a rare complication of intraocular surgery, which occurs when damaged ciliary arteries bleed into the space between the choroid and the sclera. It is a potentially vision-threatening pathology and must be treated immediately to preserve visual functions. Risk factors for suprachoroidal hemorrhage include anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL), axial myopia, advanced age, atherosclerosis, glaucoma, systolic hypertension, tachycardia, uveitis and previous ocular surgery.

Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome has an incidence ranging from around 0.5% to 2.0%. Iris or ciliary body injury has an incidence of about 0.6–1.2%. Other complications include failure to aspirate all lens fragments, leaving some in the anterior chamber, and incisional burns, caused by overheating of the phacoemulsification tip when ultrasonic power continues while the irrigation or aspiration lines are blocked—the flow through these lines is used to keep the tip cool. Burns to the incision may make closure difficult and can cause corneal astigmatism.

===After surgery===
Complications after cataract surgery are relatively uncommon. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) does not directly threaten vision, but may increase the risk of future vitreoretinal conditions. It may be more problematic in younger eyes because many people older than 60 have already gone through PVD. PVD may be accompanied by peripheral light flashes and increasing numbers of floaters.

Some people develop posterior capsular opacification (PCO), also called an &quot;after-cataract&quot;. After cataract surgery, posterior capsular cells usually undergo hyperplasia and cellular migration as part of a physiological change, showing up as a thickening, opacification, and clouding of the posterior lens capsule, which is left behind after the cataract is removed, for placement of the IOL. This may compromise visual acuity, and can usually be safely and painlessly corrected by using a Nd:YAG laser to clear the central portion of the opacified posterior pole of the capsule (posterior capsulotomy). This creates a clear central visual axis, which improves visual acuity. In very thick opacified posterior capsules, a manual surgical capsulectomy might be needed. In the event of IOL replacement, a posterior capsulotomy could allow vitreous to migrate into the anterior chamber through the opening previously occluded by the IOL, and this would have to be removed. Posterior capsule opacification reaches an incidence of about 28.4% by five years, and is influenced by many factors, including age, IOL lens material, lens design, quantity of residual lens cortex, history of ocular inflammation, and size of capsulorhexis.

Retinal detachment normally occurs at a prevalence of 1 in 1,000 (0.1%); however, people who have had cataract surgery are at an increased risk (0.5–0.6%) of developing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)—the most common form of the condition. Cataract surgery increases the rate of vitreous humour liquefaction, which leads to increased rates of RRD. When a retinal tear occurs, vitreous liquid enters the space between the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and presents as flashes of light (photopsia), dark floaters, and loss of peripheral vision. Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), a non-infectious inflammatory condition, may also occur following cataract surgery: it is usually treated with topical corticosteroids in high dosage and frequency.

Endophthalmitis is a serious infection of intraocular tissues, usually following intraocular surgery complications or penetrating trauma, and one of the most severe. It rarely occurs as a complication of cataract surgery, due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics, but there is some concern that the clear cornea incision might predispose to the increase of endophthalmitis, although no conclusive study has corroborated this suspicion. An intracameral injection of antibiotics may be used as a preventive measure. A meta-analysis showed the incidence of endophthalmitis after phacoemulsification to be 0.092%. The risk gets higher in association with factors such as diabetes, advanced age, larger incision procedures, and vitreous communication with the anterior chamber caused by posterior capsule rupture. The risk of vitreous infection is at least six times higher than for the aqueous. Endophthalmitis typically presents within two weeks after the procedure, with manifestations such as decreased visual acuity, red-eye and pain. Hypopyon occurs about 80% of the time. About 80% of infections are caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Management includes vitreous humour tap and injection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Outcomes can be severe even with treatment, and may range from permanently decreased visual acuity to the complete loss of light perception, depending on the microbiological etiology.

Glaucoma may occur and may be very difficult to control. It is usually associated with inflammation, especially when fragments of the nucleus enter the vitreous cavity. Some experts recommend early intervention by posterior pars plana vitrectomy when this condition occurs. In most cases, raised post-operative intraocular pressure is transient and benign, usually returning to baseline within 24 hours without intervention. Glaucoma patients may experience further visual field loss or a loss of fixation, and are more likely to experience intraocular pressure spikes. On the other hand, secondary glaucoma is an important complication of surgery for congenital cataracts: patients can develop this condition even several years after undergoing cataract surgery, so they need lifelong surveillance.

Mechanical pupillary block manifests when the anterior chamber gets shallower as a result of the obstruction of the aqueous humour flow through the pupil by the vitreous face or IOL. This is caused by contact between the edge of the pupil and an adjacent structure, which blocks the flow of aqueous through the pupil itself. The iris then bulges forward and closes the angle between the iris and cornea, blocking drainage through the trabecular meshwork and causing an increase in intraocular pressure. Mechanical pupillary block has mainly been identified as a complication of anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, but has been known to occur occasionally after posterior IOL implantation.

Occasionally, a peripheral iridectomy may be made to minimize the risk of pupillary block glaucoma. Surgical iridectomy can be done manually or with a . Laser peripheral iridotomy may be done either before or following cataract surgery.

Swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina, results in macular oedema and can occur a few days or weeks after surgery. Most such cases can be successfully treated. Preventative use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported to reduce the risk of macular oedema to some extent.

Uveitis–glaucoma–hyphema syndrome is a complication caused by the mechanical irritation of a mis-positioned IOL over the iris, ciliary body or iridocorneal angle.

Other possible complications include elevated intraocular pressure; swelling or oedema of the cornea, which is sometimes associated with transient or permanent cloudy vision (pseudophakic bullous keratopathy); displacement or dislocation of the IOL implant; unplanned high refractive error—either myopic or hypermetropic—due to errors in the ultrasonic biometry (measurement of the eye length and calculation of the required intraocular lens power); cyanopsia, which often occurs for a few days, weeks or months after removal of a cataract; and floaters, which commonly appear after surgery.

It may be necessary to exchange, remove or reposition an IOL after surgery, for any of the following reasons:
* Capsular block syndrome, the hyper-distention of the lens capsular bag, due to the IOL blocking fluid from draining through the anterior capsulotomy. This may cause a myopic refractive error;
* Chronic anterior uveitis, which is a persistent inflammation of the anterior segment;
* Chronic loss of endothelial cells faster than the rate due to normal aging;
* Iris pigment epithelium loss;
* Physical pain;
* Progressive elongation of the pupil in direction of the IOL&#x27;s long axis;
* Progressive closing of the anterior chamber angle, due to propagation of anterior synechiae without apparent anterior uveitis;
* Incorrect IOL refractive power;
* Incorrect positioning of the IOL (including decentring, tilt, or rotation), which partially prevents its correct function;
* Damage or deformation of the IOL;
* Unexpected optical results due to defects of the IOL;
* Undesirable optical phenomena reported by the patient due to any other cause.

===Risk===
Cataract surgery and IOL implantation have the safest and highest success rates of any eye care-related procedures. As with any type of surgery, however, some level of risk remains.

Most complications of cataract surgery do not result in long-term visual impairment, but some severe complications can lead to irreversible blindness. A survey of adverse results affecting Medicare patients recorded between 2004 and 2006 showed an average rate of 0.5% for one or more severe post-operative complications, with the rate decreasing by about 20% over the study period. The most important risk factors identified were diabetic retinopathy and a combination of cataract surgery with another intraocular procedure on the same day. In the study, 97% of the surgeries were not combined with other intraocular procedures; the remaining 3% were combined with retinal, corneal or glaucoma surgery on the same day.

==Recovery and rehabilitation==
Following cataract surgery, side-effects such as grittiness, watering, blurred vision, double vision, and a red or bloodshot eye may occur, although they usually clear after a few days. Full recovery from the operation can take four-to-six weeks. Patients are usually advised to avoid getting water in the eye during the first week after surgery, and to avoid swimming for two-to-three weeks as a conservative approach, to minimise risk of bacterial infection. Most people can return to normal activities the day after phacoemulsification surgery. Depending on the procedure, they should avoid driving for at least 24 hours after the surgery, largely due to effects from the anaesthesia, possible swelling affecting focus, and pupil dilation causing excessive glare. At the first post-operative check, the surgeon will usually assess whether the patient&#x27;s vision is suitable for driving.

With small-incision self-sealing wounds used with phacoemulsification, some of the post-operative restrictions common with intracapsular and extracapsular procedures are not relevant. Restrictions against lifting and bending were intended to reduce the risk of the wound opening, because straining increases intraocular pressure. With a self-sealing tunnel incision, however, higher pressure closes the wound more tightly. Routine use of a shield is not usually required, because inadvertent finger pressure on the eye should not open a correctly structured incision, which should only open to point pressure. After surgery, patients need to prevent contamination by avoiding rubbing their eyes, as well as not using eye makeup, face cream or lotions. Any kind of contact with excessive dust, wind, pollen or dirt should also be avoided. Moreover, people are advised to wear sunglasses on bright days, since the eyes become more sensitive to bright light for a prolonged period after surgery.

Topical anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics are commonly used in the form of eyedrops to reduce the risk of inflammation and infection. A shield or eye-patch may be prescribed to protect the eye while sleeping. The eye will be checked to ensure the IOL remains in place, and once it has fully stabilized (after about six weeks), vision tests will be used to check whether prescription lenses are needed. In cases where the focal length of the IOL is optimised for distance vision, reading glasses are generally needed for near focus.

In some cases, people are dissatisfied with the optical correction provided by the initial implants, making removal and replacement necessary; this can occur with more complex IOL designs, as the patient&#x27;s expectations might not match with the compromises inherent in these designs, or they might not be able to accommodate the difference in distance and near-focusing of monovision lenses. The patient should not participate in contact or extreme sports, or similar activities, until cleared to do so by the eye surgeon.

==Outcomes==
After full recovery, visual acuity depends on the underlying condition of the eye, the choice of IOL, and any long-term complications associated with the surgery. More than 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, with a low complication rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 80% of eyes should have a presenting visual acuity of 6/6 to 6/18 (20/20 to 20/60) after surgery, which is considered a good enough visual outcome; the percentage is expected to reach at least 90% with best correction. Acuity of between 6/18 and 6/60 (20/60 to 20/200) is regarded as borderline, whereas a value worse than 6/60 (20/200) is considered poor. Borderline or poor visual outcomes are usually influenced by pre-surgery conditions such as glaucoma, macular disease, and diabetic retinopathy.

Refractive results using power calculation formulae based on pre-operative biometrics leave people within 0.5 dioptres of target (correlates to visual acuity of 6/7.5 (20/25) when targeted for distance) in 55% of cases and within one dioptre (correlates to 6/12 (20/40) when targeted for distance) in 85% of cases. Developments in intra-operative wavefront technology have demonstrated power calculations that provide improved outcomes, yielding 80% of patients within 0.5 dioptres (6/7.5 (20/25) or better).

A ten-year prospective survey on refractive outcomes from a UK National Health Service (NHS) cataract surgery service from 2006 to 2016 showed a mean absolute error between the targeted and outcome refraction of 0.50 dioptres, with a standard deviation of 0.67 dioptres. 88.76% were within one diopter of target refraction and 62.36% within 0.50 dioptres.

According to a 2009 study conducted in Sweden, factors that affected predicted refraction error included sex, pre-operative visual acuity and glaucoma, together with other eye conditions. Second-eye surgery, macular degeneration, age and diabetes did not affect the predicted outcome. Prediction error decreased with time, which is likely due to the use of improved equipment and techniques, including more-accurate biometry. A 2013 American survey involving nearly two million bilateral cataract surgery patients found immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery was statistically associated with worse visual outcomes than for delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery; however, the difference was small and might not be clinically relevant.

There is a tendency for post-operative refraction to vary slightly over several years. A small overall myopic shift has been recorded in 33.6% and a small hypermetropic shift in 45.2% of eyes with the remaining 21.2% in the study having no reported change. Most of the change occurred during the first year after surgery.

Phacoemulsification via a coaxial incision may be associated with less astigmatism than the average for bimanual incisions, but the difference was found to be small and the evidence statistically uncertain.

==History==
Cataract surgery has a long history in Europe, Asia, and Africa, with Chrysippus of Soli, a stoic Greek philosopher providing the earliest account. Couching was the original form of cataract surgery, and was used from antiquity. It is still occasionally found in traditional medicine in parts of Africa and Asia. In 1753, Samuel Sharp performed the first-recorded surgical removal of the entire lens and lens capsule, equivalent to intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens was removed from the eye through a limbal incision.

In 1884, Karl Koller became the first surgeon to apply a cocaine solution to the cornea as a local anaesthetic. By the beginning of the 20th century, the standard surgical procedure was intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE). In 1949, Harold Ridley introduced the concept of implantation of the intraocular lens (IOL) after treating a Spitfire pilot who had fragments of acrylic plastic in his eye and realising that, unlike most other foreign material, the eye did not reject acrylic. This made visual rehabilitation after cataract surgery a more efficient, effective, and comfortable process.
Intracapsular cryoextraction was the favoured form of cataract extraction from the late 1960s to the early 1980s using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled probe tip to freeze the encapsulated lens to the probe. In 1967, Charles Kelman introduced phacoemulsification, which uses ultrasonic energy to emulsify the nucleus of the crystalline lens and remove cataracts by aspiration without a large incision. This method of surgery reduced the need for an extended hospital stay and made out-patient surgery the standard. Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs), which were introduced in 1972, facilitate the procedure and improve overall safety, particularly of phacoemulsification, by maintaining the shape of the eye at reduced pressure, and protecting the internal tissues of the eye without interfering with the operation.

In the early 1980s, Danièle Aron-Rosa and colleagues introduced the (Nd:YAG laser) for posterior capsulotomy. In 1985, Thomas Mazzocco developed and implanted the first foldable IOL, and Graham Barrett and associates pioneered the use of silicone, acrylic, and hydrogel foldable lenses. In 1987, M. Blumenthal and J. Moisseiev described the use of a reduced incision size for ECCE. They used a straight scleral tunnel incision behind the limbus with two side ports, and an anterior chamber maintainer. In 1989, M. McFarland introduced a self-sealing incision architecture, and in 1990, S.L.Pallin described a chevron-shaped incision that minimized the risk of induced astigmatism.

In 1983 G.T. Keener Jr. introduced a constricting wire loop, L.L. Fry reported the phaco-sandwich technique, and Peter Kansas suggested the phacosection method for reducing the incision required. The sclerocorneal pocket tunnel incision introduced by Kratz allowed manual small incision cataract surgery without phacoemulsification. The introduction of the anterior chamber maintainer (ACM) by Blumenthal in 1987 facilitated a high-pressure and -flow system, for a stable intraocular environment during surgery.

Vision 2020: The Right to Sight, a global initiative of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), was intended to reduce or eliminate the main causes of avoidable blindness worldwide by 2020. Programs instituted under Vision 2020 facilitated the planning, development, and implementation of sustainable national eye-care programs, including technical support and advocacy. The IAPB and WHO launched the program on 18 February 1999.

The Vision 2020 initiative succeeded in bringing avoidable blindness to the global health agenda. The causes have not been eliminated, but there have been significant changes to their distribution, which have been attributed to global demographic shifts. Remaining challenges to management of avoidable blindness include population size, gender disparities in access to eye-care, and the availability of a professional workforce.

Recent developments as of 2022 include continuing research into the possibility of lens regeneration and pharmacological approaches to slowing the development of cataracts. Lens implants that help compensate for age-related macular degeneration by magnification have been developed, but require relatively large incisions. Improved management of inflammatory response, use of ray-tracing models, artificial intelligence and a range of new formulae for refraction prediction.

==Accessibility==

Access to cataract surgery is very variable by country and region. Even in developed countries availability may vary significantly between rural and more densely populated areas.

The global health situation of cataracts is improving but this progress has not reduced the need for cataract surgery, which is still inadequate in large parts of the world. Older people, women, and lower socioeconomic status are associated with higher untreated cataract numbers.

Cataracts have the most uneven global distribution of non-communicable eye diseases, with the burden of cataracts more concentrated in countries with lower socioeconomic status. Blindness is also correlated with a lack of ophthalmologists, and density of ophthalmologists correlates with a higher national income. High-income countries had an average of 76.2
ophthalmologists, and low income countries an average of 3.7 ophthalmologists per million inhabitants. The countries with highest socioeconomic levels tend to have the best cataract surgery outcomes. Low income countries also tend to lack adequate training facilities for surgeons.

===Europe===
About 4.5 million cataract surgeries were done in the EU Member States in 2016. The rate of surgeries generally varied between 12000 and 4000 per million inhabitants. The highest rate was in Portugal, at 14000 per million and the lowest were Ireland and Slovakia at 2000 per million. The figures are not altogether comparable, as in some countries only surgeries at hospitals are included in the counts. The proportion of out-patient surgeries increased in almost all EU states between 2011 and 2016.

===Asia===
The estimated distribution of ophthalmologists in Asia ranges from more than 114 per million of population in Japan, to none in Micronesia.
South Asia has the highest global age-standardized prevalence of moderate-to-severe visual impairment (17.5%) and mild visual impairment (12.2%). Cataract has traditionally been a major cause of blindness in less-developed countries in the region, and in spite of improvements to the volume and quality of cataract surgeries, the rate of surgery remains low for some of these nations.

Cataracts are common in China; as of 2022, their estimated overall prevalence in Chinese people over 50 years old was 27.45%. The overall cataract-surgery coverage rate was 9.19%. The prevalence of cataract and cataract surgical coverage also significantly varies by region.

India&#x27;s cataract-surgical rate rose from just over 700 operations per million people per year in 1981, to 6,000 per million per year in 2011, thus getting closer to the estimated requirement of 8,000–8,700 operations per million per year needed to eliminate cataract blindness in the country. The rate&#x27;s rise was partly linked to factors such as increased efficiency due to improved surgical techniques, application of day-case surgery, improvements in operating theatre design, and efficient teamwork with sufficient staff.

===Africa===
Cataracts are the main cause of blindness in Africa, and affect approximately half of the estimated seven million blind people on the continent, a number that is expected to increase with population growth by about 600,000 people per year. As of 2005, the estimated cataract-surgery rate was about 500 operations per million people per year. Progress on gathering information on epidemiology, distribution and impact of cataracts within the African continent has been made, but significant problems and barriers limiting further access to reliable data remain.

These barriers relate to awareness, acceptance, and cost; some studies also reported community and family dynamics as discouraging factors. Most of the studies held locally reported that cataract-surgical rate was lower in females. The higher cataract-surgery coverage found in some settings in South Africa, Libya, and Kenya suggest many barriers to surgery can be overcome.

According to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, some sub-Saharan African countries have about one ophthalmologist per million people, while the National Center for Biotechnology Information stated the percentage of adults above the age of 50 in western sub-Saharan Africa who have developed cataract-induced blindness is about 6%—the highest rate in the world.

A mathematical model using survey data from sub-Saharan Africa showed the incidence of cataracts varies significantly across the continent, with the required rate of surgery to maintain a visual acuity level of 6/18 (20/60) ranging from about 1,200 to about 4,500 surgeries per year per million people, depending on the area. Such variations may relate to genetic or cultural differences, as well as life expectancy.

=== Latin America ===
A four-year longitudinal study of 19 Latin American countries published in 2010 showed most of the countries had increased their surgery rates over that period, with increases of up to 186%, but still failed to provide adequate surgical coverage. The study also showed a significant correlation between gross national income per capita and cataract-surgery rate in the countries involved.

In a study published in 2014, the weighted-mean regional surgery rate was found to have increased by 70% from 2005 to 2012, rising from 1,562 to 2,672 cataract surgeries per million inhabitants. The weighted mean number of ophthalmologists per million inhabitants in the region was approximately 62. Cataract-surgery coverage widely varied across Latin America, ranging from 15% in El Salvador, to 77% in Uruguay. Barriers cited included cost of surgery and lack of awareness about available surgical treatment. The number of available ophthalmologists appeared to be adequate, but the number of those who practised eye surgery was unknown.

A 2009 study showed that the prevalence of cataract blindness in people 50 years and older ranged from 0.5% in Buenos Aires, to 2.3% in parts of Guatemala. Poor vision due to cataracts ranged from 0.9% in Buenos Aires, to 10.7% in parts of Peru. Cataract-surgical coverage ranged from good in parts of Brazil to poor in Paraguay, Peru, and Guatemala. Visual outcome after cataract surgery was close to conformity with WHO guidelines in Buenos Aires, where more than 80% of post-surgery eyes had visual acuity of 6/18 (20/60) or better, but ranged between 60% and 79% in most of the other regions, and was less than 60% in Guatemala and Peru.

==Social, economic and environmental relevance==
It has been estimated there were 43.3 million blind people in 2020, and 295 million with moderate and severe visual impairment (MSVI), 55% of whom were female. The age-standardised global prevalence in blindness decreased by 28.5% between 1990 and 2020, but the age-standardised prevalence of MSVI increased by 2.5%. Cataract remained the global leading cause of blindness in 2020.

Cataract impairs vision and lowers quality of life. Improvements in vision help with daily activities, including work productivity and education. Cataract surgery reduces risk of falling and of dementia. It can prevent disability and is very cost effective, so it has large socioeconomic benefits, but the demand is great and the cost remains a large financial burden to public health systems.

The cost of cataract surgery depends on the type of procedure, whether it is provided privately or by a government hospital, whether it is provided by out-patient (day care) or in-patient surgery, and on the economic status of people in the region. Because of the high cost of the equipment, phacoemulsification is generally more expensive than ECCE and MSICS.

A 2021 study found that perioperative procedures before and after surgery differ considerably between various surgeons and institutions, which suggests the possibility for large amounts of unnecessary expenditure worldwide. Standardised best practice perioperative procedures can improve patient safety and have the potential to reduce unnecessary costs and unnecessary diagnostic procedures.

The restoration of functional vision or improvement in vision possible in most cases has a large social and economic impact; patients may be able to return to paid work or continue their previous jobs, and may not become dependent on support from their family or the wider society. Studies show a sustained improvement to quality of life, financial situation, physical well-being, and mental health. Cataract surgery is one of the most cost-effective health interventions, since its economic benefits considerably exceed the cost of treatment.

The 1998 World Health Report estimated 19.34 million people were bilaterally blind due to age-related cataracts, and that cataracts were responsible for 43% of all cases of blindness. This number and proportion were expected to increase due to population growth, and increased life expectancy approximately doubling the number of people older than 60 years. The global increase in blindness from cataract is estimated to be at least five million per year; a figure of 1,000 new cases per million population per year is used for planning purposes. The average outcomes of cataract surgery are improving, and consequently, surgery is being indicated at an earlier stage in cataract progression, increasing the number of operable cases. To reduce the backlog of patients, it is necessary to operate on more people per year than the new cases alone.

As of 1998, the rate of surgeries in economically developed countries was about 4,000 to 6,000 per million population per year, which was sufficient to meet demand. India raised the cataract surgery rate (CSR) to over 3,000, but this was not considered to be sufficient to reduce the backlog. Middle-income countries of Latin America and Asia have CSRs of between 500 and 2,000 per million per year, whereas China, most of Africa, and poor countries of Asia had rates of less than 500. In India and South East Asia, the rate required to keep up with the increase is at least 3,000 per million population per year; in Africa and other parts of the world with smaller percentages of older people, a rate of 2,000 may be sufficient in the short term.

In addition to the direct costs, associated surgical complications may require further intervention. In high income countries the environmental costs also tend to be higher. A phacoemulsification surgery in a UK hospital was estimated to cost more than 20 times the greenhouse gas emission of an equivalent surgery in an Indian hospital. Some of the unnecessary costs may be due to regulatory requirements that are based on perceived safety rather than actual safety.

==Special populations==

===Congenital cataracts===

In general, there is greater urgency to remove dense cataracts from very young children because of the risk of amblyopia. For optimal visual development in newborns and young infants, a visually significant unilateral congenital cataract should be detected and removed before the child is six weeks old, while visually significant bilateral congenital cataracts should be removed before 10 weeks. Congenital cataracts that are too small to affect vision will not be removed or treated, but may be monitored by an ophthalmologist throughout the patient&#x27;s life. Commonly, a patient with small congenital cataracts that do not damage vision will be affected later in life, though this will take decades to occur.

, the standard of care for pediatric cataract surgery for children older than two years is primary posterior intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Primary IOL implantation before the age of seven months is considered to have no advantages over aphakia. According to a 2015 study, primary IOL implantation in the seven-months-to-two-years age groups should be considered in children who require cataract surgery. Research into the possibility of regeneration of infant lenses from lens epithelial cells showed interesting results in a small trial study reported in 2016.

===Higher risk for operations on separate occasions===
Most patients have bilateral cataracts; although surgery in one eye can restore functional vision, second-eye surgery has many advantages, so most patients undergo surgery in each eye on separate days. Operating on both eyes on the same day as separate procedures is known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery; this can decrease the number of hospital visits, thus reducing risk of contagion in an epidemic. Immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery also has significant cost savings, and faster visual rehabilitation and neuroadaptation. Another indication is significant cataracts in both eyes of patients for whom two rounds of anaesthesia and surgery would be unsuitable. The risk of simultaneous bilateral complications is low.

==Other animals==
Cataract surgery in small animals such as dogs and cats is a routine ophthalmic procedure with a success rate of around 90%, and is usually better for eyes with relatively recent cataract development. The presence of other ocular problems may reduce the success rate. Procedures are similar to those for humans. General anesthesia is likely to be used, but sub-Tenon injection and a low-dose neuromuscular blockade protocol have also been used for canine cataract surgery.
