<text>Dudley Nichols (April 6, 1895 – January 4, 1960) was an American screenwriter and film director. He was the first person to decline an Academy Award, as part of a boycott to gain recognition for the Screen Writers Guild; he would later accept his Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1938.

==Biography==
Dudley Nichols was born April 6, 1895, in Wapakoneta, Ohio. He studied at the University of Michigan where he was active member of the Sigma chapter of Theta Xi fraternity.

After working as a reporter for the &quot;New York World&quot;, Nichols moved to Hollywood in 1929 and became one of the most highly regarded screenwriters of the 1930s and 1940s. He collaborated on many films over many years with director John Ford, and was also noted for his work with George Cukor, Howard Hawks, Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir.

Nichols wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for films including &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945), &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945), &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945), &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957).

Nichols initially declined the Academy Award he received in 1936 for &quot;The Informer&quot;, due to a dispute between the Screen Writers Guild, of which he was a founder, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He collected the award at the 1938 Oscar ceremony. He served as president of the Screen Writers Guild in 1937 and 1938.

He also co-wrote the documentary &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot;, which won the 1942 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Nichols produced and directed three films—&quot;Government Girl&quot; (1943), &quot;Sister Kenny&quot; (1946) and &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1947)—for which he also wrote the screenplay.

==Awards==
In 1954 he received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.

==Death==
He died in Hollywood of cancer in 1960 and was interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

<doc id="1183727" wikidata="Q5233165" url="?curid=1183727" title="David E. Davis">
<text>David Evan Davis Jr. (November 7, 1930 – March 27, 2011) was an American automotive journalist and magazine publisher widely known as a contributing writer, editor and publisher at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine and as the founder of &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine.

Davis influenced the format of automotive journalism by introducing premium publishing features and he influenced the profession by mentoring a gamut of automotive photographers, illustrators, designers and journalists – including Jean Lindamood Jennings, Robert Cumberford, Bruce McCall, P. J. O&#x27;Rourke, Jim Harrison and David Halberstam – as well as younger colleagues and journalism students.

Known for his own straightforward writing style and his colorful personality – at six-foot-three inches tall, bearded, portly and always immaculately dressed – Davis had once been featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;On the Street&quot; fashion section. Automotive writer Todd Lassa called him &quot;a raconteur, an impresario, a bon vivant in a tweed, three-piece suit.&quot; As an editor he maintained an &quot;atmosphere of creative turbulence.&quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;a combative swashbuckler who encouraged criticism of the cars it tested, even at the risk of losing advertising.&quot;

His collected writings were published in 1999 &quot;Thus Spake David E.: The Collected Wit and Wisdom of the Most Influential Automotive Journalist of Our Time&quot;.

Davis said his success in automotive journalism came from &quot;his ability to marry southern storytelling to big-city presentation.&quot; &quot;The Truth About Cars&quot; said &quot;automotive journalism in the post-Vietnam-War era was entirely and singlehandedly defined by David E. Davis Jr.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Davis the &quot;dean of automotive journalists.&quot;

==Background==
Davis was born in Burnside, Kentucky, on November 7, 1930 – in a house without running water, on a hill called Tyree&#x27;s Knob. His aunt was Harriette Arnow, author of the best-selling novel, The Dollmaker. Davis graduated from high school in Royal Oak, Michigan, having failed his journalism class. He later briefly attended Olivet College. He worked in a series of jobs: as a race car driver, Volkswagen salesman, men&#x27;s clothing salesman, ad salesman with &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; ,and assembly line worker in a car factory. He would develop his &quot;simple, declarative [writing] style&quot; working on aviation technical manuals.

Davis overturned while racing his sports car (an MG TF 1500) at age 25 in Sacramento – badly damaging his face. He lost his left eyelid, the bridge of his nose, the roof of his mouth and most of his teeth. In addition to the accident essentially scraping off half his face, the ambulance attendant had thrown away pieces of his nose. Davis required extensive plastic surgery – and was later able to hide his disfigurement under his full beard. He described the crash and its aftermath as pivotal:

Davis lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with his second wife Jeannie Luce Kuhn Davis. His three children from his first marriage to Norma Jean Wohlfiel Davis were Peg, David E. Davis III, and Matthew, who has held a number of roles in the automotive business, including senior PR jobs at Nissan and Infiniti and working as a European contributor for numerous publications, including &quot;Autoblog&quot;. He had three stepchildren – Eleonore Kuhn Snow, Vincent and Anthony Kuhn.

He died unexpectedly at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ypsilanti, Michigan on March 27, 2011, shortly following bladder cancer surgery.

==Career==
After selling an article to &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in 1957 for $50, Davis became a contributing writer in 1962 to &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine, at age 32. By the time he joined &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, Davis had &quot;worked in four automobile factories, sold cars in three imported-car dealerships and one Packard showroom.&quot; At the magazine, he became friends with automotive luminaries including race car drivers Juan Manuel Fangio, Dan Gurney and Carroll Shelby. Davis left &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in 1967 – reported variously as either having been fired by Leon Mandel or having resigned as a result of a difference of opinion with management over his criticism of the Blaupunkt radio in his &quot;Turn your Hymnals to 2002&quot; column.

At Chevrolet&#x27;s advertising agency, Campbell-Ewald, Davis wrote copy for Corvette and Corvair advertisements alongside future crime novelist Elmore Leonard. He was named Vice President/Creative director. He is co-credited along with James Hartzell in creating Chevrolet&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet&quot; – a campaign that Car and Driver and other publications ranked as the best automobile commercial of all time.
He returned to &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in 1976 to serve as the magazine&#x27;s editor and publisher – and moved its headquarters from New York to Ann Arbor in 1977. He resigned as Editor/Publisher in 1985 when Car and Driver was sold to CBS.

In 1986, he founded &quot;Automobile&quot; with financial backing from Rupert Murdoch – using the credo &quot;No Boring Cars.&quot; Davis introduced full-color photography and thick stock, increasing the magazine&#x27;s literary standards to distinguish it from the other three U.S. automotive magazines, &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. Murdoch sold the magazine profitably in 1991 to K-III Publications, which became Primedia – which was later sold to Source Interlink Media (now Motor Trend Group), the current owner of the magazine. When &quot;Automobile&quot; was acquired by K-III, Davis also became the editorial director of the company&#x27;s &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine. &quot;Automobile&quot; celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011.

Davis later left Primedia and in semi-retirement started the online automotive magazine &quot;Winding Road&quot;. In July 2009, he returned to Car and Driver as a contributor. Until his death, he continued to contribute to numerous automotive venues, including international publications such as the British magazine &quot;CAR&quot;.

Davis mentored a spectrum of automotive journalists, including Eddie Alterman, editor-in-chief at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and Jean Jennings, former president and editor-in-chief (after Davis himself) at &quot;Automobile.&quot; At the University of Michigan he was member of the board of the Knight-Wallace Fellowship, a journalism program, and he encouraged Ford Motor Company to underwrite a fellowship for automotive journalism at the school. In 2004, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Michigan, serving as its spring 2004 commencement speaker.

==Personality==
Davis was widely known for his &quot;larger-than-life,&quot; &quot;polarizing personality.&quot; Joe DeMatio, deputy editor at Automobile Magazine said Davis &quot;was very opinionated and did not hesitate to ruffle feathers, even if they were those of his own bosses.&quot;

Unintimidated by the companies whose products he reviewed, Davis originally resigned from &quot;Car and Driver&quot; after refusing to rescind a comment he made about a BMW 2002&#x27;s weak radio reception and dash; saying its Blaupunkt radio &quot;could not pick up a Manhattan station from the other side of the George Washington Bridge.&quot; General Motors which owned Opel and sold the cars through Buick dealers in the U.S., withdrew much of its advertising when he parked an Opel Kadett in a junkyard for a &quot;hit piece&quot;, AKA James R. Healey, the auto columnist for USAToday, recalled that while speaking at the Washington Automotive Press Association, Davis also likened General Motors managers to the piano players in a whorehouse, &quot;aware of what was going on upstairs but unable to do much about it even if they were so inclined.&quot; He ended the speech by saying that the company was standing on the &quot;shoulders of midgets&quot;. The company subsequently pulled much of its advertising. In 2010, he published a column in Car &amp; Driver titled &quot;If the original Henry Ford was still alive, he would be building Subarus.&quot;

Davis was periodically estranged from the editor of &quot;Automobile&quot;, Jean Jennings, who described him as &quot;the most interesting, most difficult, cleverest, darkest, most erudite, dandiest, and most inspirational, charismatic and all-around damnedest human being I will ever meet. I have loved him. I have seriously not loved him.&quot; He also maintained an ongoing friendly rivalry with automotive writer Brock Yates, who said &quot;to know [Davis] is to acknowledge his short fuse and his penchant for unpredictable, snorting charges at friendly targets.&quot;

David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research called Davis &quot;a provocateur, in some ways kind of like the Bob Lutz of auto journalism.&quot; Bob Lutz himself said Davis &quot;was one of those rare individuals who filled a room with his presence.&quot; Michael Jordan, executive editor at Edmunds.com, said that &quot;at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in the early 1960s, Davis made himself important, yet he also made automotive journalism important.&quot; Eddie Alterman, editor-in-chief at &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, described Davis as &quot;the dashing, witty, high-spirited, and deeply knowledgeable writer/editor who brought the automobile to life.&quot;

His office was filled automotive art and featured a clipping with Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s 1914 ad to enlist participants in a voyage to Antarctica: &quot;Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.&quot; Outside his office hung an ad reading &quot;Protest Against the Rising Tide of Conformity.&quot;

In everyday situations, rather than the conventional &quot;How are you?&quot;, Davis was known to ask &quot;Is your life a rich tapestry?&quot;

<text>Count Apollos Apollosovich Musin-Pushkin (; February 17, 1760 – April 18, 1805) was a Russian chemist and plant collector. He led a botanical expedition to the Caucasus in 1802 with his friend botanist Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein.

In 1797, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was a member of the Russian mining board and developed several new methods of refining and processing of platinum. The genus of Puschkinia commemorates his name.

<text>Automobile was an American automobile magazine published from 1986 to 2020. It was founded in 1986 by a group of former &quot;Car and Driver&quot; employees, led by David E. Davis with support from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, using the credo &quot;No Boring Cars.&quot;

&quot;Automobile&quot; positioned itself more broadly than the other automotive publications, an editorial theme expanded by editor David E. Davis: the magazine de-emphasized instrumented tests and elaborate technical data, instead offering subjective, experiential reports; providing in-depth review of older cars with its &quot;Collectible Classics&quot; series; and offering styling analysis with its column by former General Motors designer Robert Cumberford.

In 1991 the magazine was bought by K-III Communications (later Primedia). In 2007, the publication was acquired by Source Interlink (later TEN: The Enthusiast Network). In 2017, it became part of Discovery Communications.

In December 2019, Discovery&#x27;s subsidiary TEN Publishing announced the discontinuation of &quot;Automobile&quot;. Its final issue was dated February 2020.

<text>Liouville is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It was named after French mathematician Joseph Liouville. It lies to the southeast of the larger crater Dubyago, and was previously designated Dubyago S before being given a name by the IAU.

The crater is circular and bowl-shaped, with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping interior walls. The western and northwestern rim is attached to a depression in the surface that has the appearance of a distorted crater formation. Farther to the west is the comparably sized Respighi.

<text>Jason Daniel Kendall (born June 26, 1974) is an American former professional baseball catcher who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He also played for the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers and Kansas City Royals. He is the son of former catcher Fred Kendall, who played in the majors from 1969 to 1980.

In a fifteen-year major league career, Kendall played in 2,085 games, accumulating 2,195 hits in 7,627 at bats for a .288 career batting average along with 75 home runs, 744 runs batted in and a .366 on-base percentage. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage. Kendall holds the major league record for most career stolen bases by a catcher since the dead-ball era with 189. At the time of his retirement in 2012, Kendall ranked second among major league catchers in career hits and doubles behind only Iván Rodríguez.

==High school==
Kendall attended Torrance High School in California, where he tied a national high school record by hitting safely in 43 straight games. He was drafted out of high school in the first round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft (23rd overall pick) by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1996–2004)===
Kendall made his major league debut in 1996. In his rookie year, he hit .300, made the National League All-Star Team, and was named NL rookie of the year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (he finished third in voting for the MLB Rookie of the Year award). He was also an All-Star in and . In 1999, he suffered a season-ending injury when he dislocated his ankle while running to first base in a July 4 game against Milwaukee after attempting to beat out a bunt.

On May 19, 2000, Kendall became the first player in Pirates history to hit for the cycle at Three Rivers Stadium, driving in five of Pittsburgh&#x27;s thirteen runs against the St. Louis Cardinals. On November 18, 2000, Kendall signed a six-year contract extension worth $60 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It was the most expensive contract in Pirates history and made him the second-highest-paid catcher at the time, behind only Mike Piazza.

In 2002 and 2005, he led the majors in at-bats per strikeout (18.1 in 2002, 15.4 in 2005). He also led the major leagues in 2005 in times reached base on an error (15). From 2002 through 2004, Kendall led all major league catchers in games and innings behind the plate. He is the Pirates&#x27; all-time leader in games caught.

===Oakland Athletics and Chicago Cubs (2005–2007)===

After the 2004 season, the Pirates traded Kendall and cash to the Oakland Athletics for Mark Redman, Arthur Rhodes and cash. During the 2005 season, Kendall struggled at the plate. His .321 slugging percentage was the worst (by 20 points) among all major league players who qualified for the batting title. His .271 batting average was the second-lowest of his career. In the field, he allowed 101 stolen bases, more than any other catcher in major league baseball. However, he did bat leadoff for Oakland, something that is very rare to see out of a baseball catcher.

During a game against the Angels on May 2, 2006, Kendall was involved in a bench-clearing incident. John Lackey threw a pitch that started high and inside to Kendall, and then broke back towards the plate. Kendall stepped out of the batter&#x27;s box and began yelling at Lackey, who told him to stop leaning over the plate with his elbow guard sticking out, trying to be hit by a pitch (as Kendall was known to do throughout his career). Kendall then charged the mound and wrestled with the Lackey. The two spun around as catcher Jeff Mathis fell behind Kendall who was then punched in the ribs by Lackey, and the two tumbled to the ground. The season marked Kendall&#x27;s first post-season appearance, as the Athletics clinched the 2006 American League Western Division championship on September 26. He recorded his first playoff hit in the second game of the American League Division Series off Minnesota&#x27;s Boof Bonser.

On July 16, , he was traded to the Chicago Cubs for fellow catcher Rob Bowen and minor league pitcher Jerry Blevins. At the time of the trade, Kendall had the lowest on-base percentage (.261) and second lowest slugging percentage (.281) of any starter in major league baseball for 2007. In the field he allowed 111 stolen bases (131 attempts, 20 caught), more than any other catcher in major league baseball.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2008–2009)===

On November 21, 2007, Kendall agreed to a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. Kendall threw out roughly 40% of base stealers in 2008. Upon making his 110th start of the 2008 season, Kendall fulfilled the option in his contract, securing himself a spot in the Brewers lineup in 2009.

On May 18, 2009, Kendall recorded his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth full-time catcher to reach that milestone. In 2009, he had the lowest slugging percentage of any starter in the major leagues, at .305. During his two years with the Brewers his AVG, OBP, and SLG were .244, .329, and .315.

===Kansas City Royals (2010–2012)===
On December 11, 2009, Kendall signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Royals.

Kendall underwent season-ending surgery on September 3, 2010, on his right shoulder after an MRI exam revealed extensive tearing in his rotator cuff. He missed the entire 2011 season because of this injury. He became a free agent after the 2011 season.

Kendall signed with Kansas City on July 19, 2012, to a minor league contract. He played in two games for the AA Northwest Arkansas Naturals before announcing his retirement on July 24.

==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement, Kendall spent seven years as a special assignment coach in the Royals&#x27; organization, during which time he earned a World Series ring. On May 14, 2022, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates to serve in a player development role.

==Playing style==
Kendall was known as a fundamentally sound catcher who was very good at blocking pitches and handling pitching staffs, despite a relatively weak throwing arm. At the plate, Kendall was known for his very open batting stance and was a contact hitter who tended to &quot;crowd&quot; the plate. He was known to not use batting gloves. He was known as fiercely competitive, and was involved in several bench-clearing brawls. Kendall was also hit by pitches frequently as a result of his batting stance; he was hit 254 times, which is fifth all-time.

Besides being a target for being hit by pitches, Kendall was a stolen-base threat. His 189 career stolen bases are second to Roger Bresnahan in all of modern era MLB history for stolen bases by a player primarily playing catcher. Kendall&#x27;s plate discipline and rare speed at the catcher position also enabled him to be used as a leadoff hitter. Kendall started the game batting leadoff in 438 of his 2,085 games played, including 119 of his 147 games in 2004 and 90 of his 143 games in 2006 (&quot;leadoff&quot; is defined as starting the game as the first player to bat for his team and having at least two at-bats in the game).

==Personal life==
Kendall moved to Kansas City in 2010 where he met his wife, Tricia Kendall, where they are raising their respective children Ethan, Kuyper, Cole, and Karoline.

Kendall has written a book with Lee Judge, &quot;Throwback: A Big-League Catcher Tells How the Game Is Really Played&quot;, released in May 2014 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

<text>Năvodari (, historical names: &quot;Carachioi&quot;; &quot;Caracoium&quot;, ) is a town in Constanța County, region of Northern Dobruja, Romania, with a population of 34,398 as of 2021. The town formally includes a territorially distinct community, Social Group Peninsula, and administers the neighbouring village of Mamaia-Sat.

==Etymology==
The name of the town means &quot;trawlers&quot; in Romanian.

==History==
The settlement was mentioned for the first time in 1421 under the name &quot;Kara Koyun&quot; (&quot;Black Sheep&quot;), to be renamed later on &quot;Karaköy&quot; or &quot;Carachioi&quot; (&quot;The Black Village&quot;). In 1927, the locality was again renamed to &quot;Năvodari&quot; and after five years, on 15 August 1932, it was granted commune status.

The town developed during the communist regime as part of the industrialization program. In 1957, the superphosphate and sulfuric acid plant, also known as USAS (&quot;Uzina de Superfosfat și Acid Sulfuric&quot;), whose construction had started in 1954, was opened, paving the road towards the industrialization of the area and demographic growth. However, the factory polluted the Black Sea and Lake Tașaul with toxic dumps. In the 1990s, the pollution was greatly reduced as the factory was modernized.

In 1968 the population of Năvodari exceeded 6,500 inhabitants. A law adopted that year granted the commune of Năvodari town status and placed the &quot;Mamaia Sat&quot; village under its administration. The modernization of the town began in 1975 and was completed on 29 June 1979.

==Current status==

Today Năvodari is an important chemical and industrial town featuring a car repairs factory and the Petromidia Refinery, which is the largest Romanian oil refinery and one of the largest in Eastern Europe. 

Năvodari has also developed in the social and cultural fields; in the city center there is a children&#x27;s town, built between 1969 and 1972, vacation accommodations, and sports facilities where up to 12,000 visitors can be accommodated.

Some from the town itself there is a summer camp (the largest one in Romania), built under the communist regime for school children. Due to its interesting programmes, good accommodation and affordable prices, it was extremely popular among teachers and parents. In the early 2000s, it was opened for the public at large as a cheap seaside resort.

CS Năvodari is an amateur football club based in the town. Founded in 1993, the club currently plays in Liga IV.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Năvodari had a population of 34,398. At the 2011 census, the town&#x27;s population consisted of 29,873 ethnic Romanians (94.67%), 283 Hungarians (0.90%), 309 Roma (0.98%), 10 Germans (0.03%), 297 Turks (0.94%), 115 Tatars (0.36%), 545 Lipovans (1.73%), 27 Aromanians (0.09%), 77 others (0.24%), and 18 with undeclared ethnicity (0.06%).

==Notable natives==
*Laurențiu Duță (b. 1976), member of the 3rei Sud Est band
*Adrian Lungu (b. 1960), Romania&#x27;s most capped rugby union player

<text>Daly is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon, to the northwest of the crater Apollonius. This formation is relatively circular, with a slight inward bulge along the northern rim. The inner wall is wider in the southern half than in the north. The crater intrudes into the comparably sized crater Apollonius F to the east-southeast.

The crater is named after Reginald Aldworth Daly. It was previously designated Apollonius P.

<text>Sports Car International (SCI) was an automobile magazine published in the United States from 1986 to 2008 by Ross Periodicals Inc, first in Newport Beach, but then later in Novato, California.

==History==
The magazine was unabashedly enthusiast-oriented, assuming a good knowledge of sports cars, racing, and automotive history. The magazine was originally edited by Mark Ewing. In the 1990s, (after the move from Newport Beach to Northern California) Jay Lamm served as editor; Lamm had worked at other publications, including &quot;Autoweek&quot;, and had written books on cars like the Mazda Miata. In 1994, SCI became the first magazine publication to go all-digital in its printing process. In 2006, Erik Gustafson served as editor, and upgraded the publication&#x27;s layout, editorial style, and format to compete directly with rival top automotive publications.

The magazine ceased publication with the November 2008 edition due to cost factors such as a lack of advertising revenue. The publisher stated that all subscribers would ride out their subscription with &quot;Excellence&quot;, a magazine focused on Porsche automobiles. For those who already have subscriptions to &quot;Excellence&quot; and SCI, &quot;Forza&quot;, a Ferrari magazine would be the substitute.

The first magazine ever to be produced using computer to plate (CTP) process in 1994, by Publishers Press Inc.

<doc id="1183755" wikidata="Q7083610" url="?curid=1183755" title="Old Castlemaine Gaol">
<text>The Old Castlemaine Gaol is a former prison, located in Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia. The building was modelled on Pentonville prison in London, replacing the original, designed by Inspector General John Price, which was never occupied. Built in 1861 to house offenders from the goldfields and nearby towns, it served various functions in the penal system before it was closed in 1990 and its prisoners transferred to HM Prison Loddon.

From 1861 to 1908, the gaol housed all manner of criminals, including lunatics and debtors, and ten men were hanged within the walls. In the later of these years however, the gaol housed mostly short-term prisoners and first-time offenders.

Between 1909 and 1951, the gaol was converted into a reformatory school for boys aged between 16 and 25. Most were under 21.

The gaol then closed for a number of years, before reopening in 1954 to accommodate medium-security prisoners from across the state. It remained open until August 1990.

After it ceased prison operations, it was used as a hotel and tourist attraction. It served as the studio for local community radio station WMA FM/Main FM 94.9 as well as various small businesses.

In 2018, the old gaol was sold to artist David Bromley.

The grounds were originally landscaped by renowned landscape gardener Hugh Linaker.

==Notable prisoners==
*Peter Dupas, who was serving a life sentence for multiple murder and rape.
* Greek illusionist, Alexander Canaris, served three months for larceny in 1889–1890.

==Notable wardens==
*From around 1868 to 1875, Thomas Francis Hyland, later a very successful wine industry businessman of Penfolds fame, was the notoriously hard-driving governor of the gaol. Under his tutelage, prisoners were obliged to work or do without rations. Within a few years, not only the gaol, but the town of Castlemaine had been transformed by their efforts and his organisational skills.

<doc id="1183756" wikidata="Q7340783" url="?curid=1183756" title="Robb Johnson">
<text>Robb Jenner Johnson (born 25 December 1955) is a British musician and songwriter who has been called &quot;one of the last genuinely political songwriters&quot;. He is known for his mix of political satire and wit. He has his own record label, Irregular Records, and has released more than 40 albums since 1985, either solo or in several collaborations.

==Biography==
Johnson began his musical career playing in folk clubs in the 1970s. He ran a folk club at the University of Sussex, before forming a band called Grubstreet, which split up in 1983. Two years later, he made his first solo album, &quot;In Amongst the Rain&quot;, setting up his own label on which to release it, before forming an agitprop group, The Ministry of Humour, with Mark Shilcock and Graham Barnes. After the break-up of this act and a failed attempt at forming a new electric band, he returned to performing solo, and also formed a duo with female singer Pip Collings.

In 1997, he composed the song cycle &quot;Gentle Men&quot;, based on the experiences of his grandfathers in the First World War. The song cycle was recorded by Johnson in collaboration with Roy Bailey, and performed at the commemorative Passchendaele Peace Concert. In 2006 he was a special guest at the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Folk Britannia&quot; concert at the Barbican Centre, ending the night with a rendition of the World War I song &quot;Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire&quot;. He remains active and has released at least one album annually for over 20 years, as well as playing regular gigs, including benefits and political events.

In 2016, Johnson and a group billed as the Corbynistas released the single &quot;JC 4 PM 4 Me&quot; in support of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, which was considered a contender for Christmas number one. However, it did not chart.

<text>Darney is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the region of the Moon where the Mare Nubium joins the Oceanus Procellarum. It was named after French astronomer . To the south is the lava-flooded crater Lubiniezky. The southern rim of Darney is attached to a series of low ridges that extend to the southwest.

This is a bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. The crater has a relatively high albedo compared to the surrounding dark lunar mare, and the crater is at the focus of a small ray system extending for 110 kilometers.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Darney.

<doc id="1183764" wikidata="Q2546135" url="?curid=1183764" title="William L. Dawson (politician)">
<text>William Levi Dawson (April 26, 1886 – November 9, 1970) was an American politician and lawyer who represented a Chicago, Illinois district for more than 27 years in the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1943 to his death in office in 1970. In 1949, he became the first African American to chair a congressional committee.

Born in segregated Georgia, Dawson attended Fisk University in Tennessee and Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago. He served as an officer in the segregated U.S. Army in World War I. Back in Chicago, he became a successful lawyer, community leader, and Democratic Party activist.

Like his two predecessors representing Illinois&#x27; 1st District, when Dawson was first elected in 1942, he was the only African American in Congress. He was active in the civil rights movement and sponsored registration drives. In the late 1940s he successfully opposed efforts to re-segregate the military.

Dawson was the first African American to chair a standing committee in the United States Congress, when he chaired the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. He served as chair of that committee and its successor for most of the years between 1949 and 1970. After 1952, Dawson also became closely aligned with the political machine in Chicago, collaborating often with Mayor Richard J. Daley. In this role, he focused on patronage and services for his constituents. He gave no support to the efforts of Martin Luther King Jr. to shake up city politics in the late 1960s.

==Early life and education==
Dawson was born in Albany, Georgia in 1886. He attended the local public segregated school and graduated from Albany Normal School in 1905, which prepared teachers for lower schools. He continued his studies at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1909.

He moved to the Chicago area in Illinois in 1912 to study at Northwestern University Law School. He was initiated into Theta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He reached Chicago at the beginning of the Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of African Americans from rural areas of the South to industrial cities in the North and Midwest - more than 1.5 million migrated up to 1940, and millions more after that.

==Career==
With the entry of the U.S. into World War I, Dawson served in France as a first lieutenant with the 366th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army from 1917 until 1919. After returning home, he was admitted to the bar in 1920 and started a private practice in Chicago.

Dawson entered politics, becoming a member of the Republican Party in 1930 as a state central committeeman for the First Congressional District of Illinois. He held this position until 1932. That year he was elected as an alderman for the second ward of Chicago, serving from 1933 until 1939. After that, he served as a Democratic Party committeeman.

Dawson was elected in 1942 as a Democratic Representative from Illinois to the Seventy-eighth, and to the thirteen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1943, until his death from pneumonia in Chicago, Illinois in 1970. In addition to influencing national policy, he acted as a mentor for rising young black politicians in Chicago, such as Archibald Carey Jr., helping with their elections and federal appointments.

During his tenure in the House, Dawson was a vocal opponent of the poll tax, which in practice was discriminatory against poorer voters. Since the end of the nineteenth century, poll taxes were among a variety of measures passed by southern states to disfranchise most black voters and tens of thousands of poor whites as well, particularly in Alabama through the 1940s.

Dawson is credited with defeating the Winstead Amendment. Proposed by Representative William Winstead (D-Mississippi) after the Truman administration integrated the United States armed forces following World War II, it would have allowed military members to opt out of racially integrated units.

In 1952, Dawson was the featured speaker at the first annual conference of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (a civil rights organization), held in the all-black town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi. He was invited by Dr. T.R.M. Howard, who headed the RCNL. Dawson was the first black congressman to speak in the state since Reconstruction ended in 1877.

Dawson, a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), had the long-term goal of increasing national black support for the party. Since the Civil War, most blacks had been allied with the Republican Party, as it had emancipated the slaves and led the movement for amendments to grant them citizenship and the franchise. T.R.M. Howard, who had moved to Chicago, challenged Dawson as a Republican opponent in the 1958 election, but Dawson won and kept his seat.

Dawson was the first African American to serve as the chairman of a regular congressional committee beginning in 1949, leading the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments in the Eighty-first and Eighty-second Congresses. He chaired its successor, the Committee on Government Operations, in the Eighty-fourth through Ninety-first Congresses. For years he and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. from Harlem, New York, were the only two African-American representatives in Congress.

Dawson was also leader of the African-American &quot;submachine&quot; within the Cook County Democratic Organization. In the predominantly African-American wards, Dawson acted as his own political boss, handing out patronage and punishing rivals just as leaders of the larger machine did, such as Richard J. Daley. However, Dawson&#x27;s machine had to continually support the regular machine in order to retain its own clout. He chose to work on city politics from this stance, rather than to conduct open civil rights challenges, and did not support the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago in the 1960s. Dawson undercut the nascent efforts of the Chicago Housing Authority in the early 1950s to integrate Black residents into white neighborhoods because those neighborhoods were outside Dawson&#x27;s district and, hence, not votes he could deliver to the machine.

Dawson advised 1960 presidential candidate John F. Kennedy not to &quot;use the phrase &#x27;civil rights&#x27; in his speeches, because it might hurt the feelings of Dawson&#x27;s Southern friends in Congress -- friends who had given Dawson control over many jobs in federal agencies.&quot; President Kennedy offered Dawson the position of United States Postmaster General as a reward for his work on Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 election campaign. Dawson declined, as he believed that he could accomplish more in the House.

Dawson died of pneumonia in Chicago on November 9, 1970. He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in the columbarium in the Griffin Funeral Home in Chicago.

<text>Lupeni (; German: &quot;Schylwolfsbach&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Lupény&quot;) is a mining city in the Jiu Valley in Hunedoara County, Romania, in the historical region of Transylvania. It is one of the oldest and largest cities in the Jiu Valley. It is located on the banks of the Western Jiu River within the Jiu Valley, at a height varying between (in the east) and . The distance from Lupeni to Petroșani is on the DN66A road, and to Deva (the capital of Hunedoara County) it is .

The name is derived from the Romanian &quot;lup&quot;, meaning &quot;wolf&quot;. Throughout the second part of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s economy was based on mining, but since the 1990s the economy has become more diverse, after many mines were closed.

==History==
The first records of people inhabiting this area date back to prehistorical times, as evidenced by the discoveries made at the Straja-Lupeni hill cave, where old pottery objects were found. The city of Lupeni was first attested in 1770. During the Middle Ages, the Jiu Valley was sparsely populated, with the inhabitants living in small villages, and shepherding being the main activity.

Lupeni was formed as a result of the intense migration of people coming from Valea Streiului and Țara Hațegului, who were attracted by the rich pastures and hayfields of the area. The residents of the village of Valea Lupului (Wolf Valley) are those who are believed to have founded Lupeni.
After 1840, mining exploration and exploitation started to develop in the area, and major economic and social changes took place. Foreign workers, primarily Polish, Czech, Austrian, Slovak, and Hungarian miners, as well as Romanian miners from the Apuseni Mountains and Baia Mare, were brought to work in the Jiu Valley. The mining activity began south of Lupeni. Lupeni soon become a major coal producer with a mono-industrial development, with about 80% of the population living from mining and other related activities. The city become very prosperous and experienced continuous population growth. However, the industrial development of the area was severely affected by the economic crisis of the interwar period, which eventually led to the Lupeni Strike of 1929.

Lupeni was declared a city in 1941, at which time it had 12,000 inhabitants. After World War II, over 600 Poles were repatriated from Lupeni to Kędzierzyn, Poland.

During the communist regime, the mines were nationalized by the communist government. In 1977, Lupeni was the site of the Jiu Valley miners&#x27; strike of 1977. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, in the 1990s, mining operations entered a restructuring process that had a very strong social and economic impact on the city. A large number of mines were closed, and this also affected other related activities, such as suppliers of materials, equipment and services, and agents that operated in the trade and services areas. Nevertheless, in recent years, new areas of economic development emerged, such as tourism, forestry industry, bakery industry, and commerce.

The city&#x27;s remaining active mine is the Lupeni Coal Mine managed by the Petroșani-based National Hard Coal Company.

<text>La Cousine Bette (, &quot;Cousin Bette&quot;) is an 1846 novel by French author Honoré de Balzac. Set in mid-19th-century Paris, it tells the story of an unmarried middle-aged woman who plots the destruction of her extended family. Bette works with Valérie Marneffe, an unhappily married young lady, to seduce and torment a series of men. One of these is Baron Hector Hulot, husband to Bette&#x27;s cousin Adeline. He sacrifices his family&#x27;s fortune and good name to please Valérie, who leaves him for a well-off merchant named Crevel. The book is part of the &quot;Scènes de la vie parisienne&quot; section of Balzac&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; (&quot;The Human Comedy&quot;).

In the 1840s, a serial format known as the &quot;roman-feuilleton&quot; was highly popular in France, and the most acclaimed expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue&#x27;s supremacy, and prove himself the most capable &quot;feuilleton&quot; author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; at the end of 1846, then collected with a companion work, &quot;Le Cousin Pons&quot;, the following year.

The novel&#x27;s characters represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie stand on one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The patriarch of the Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense&#x27;s husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event in the life of Balzac&#x27;s friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.

&quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; is considered Balzac&#x27;s last great work. His trademark use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier novels. Several critics have hailed it as a turning point in the author&#x27;s career, and others have called it a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; as well as Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. The novel explores themes of vice and virtue, as well as the influence of money on French society. Bette&#x27;s relationship with Valérie is also seen as an important exploration of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced, including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role.

==Background==
By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had achieved tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing a series of potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, &quot;Les Chouans&quot; (&quot;The Chouans&quot;), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot; (&quot;The Magic Skin&quot;), in 1831, &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; (&quot;Father Goriot&quot;) in 1835, and the two-volume &quot;Illusions perdues&quot; (&quot;Lost Illusions&quot;), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, he spent most of his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.

As his work gained recognition, Balzac began corresponding with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Hańska, who first contacted him through an anonymous 1832 letter signed &quot;L&#x27;Étrangère&quot; (&quot;The Stranger&quot;). They developed an affectionate friendship in letters, and when she became a widow in 1841, Balzac sought her hand in marriage. He visited her often in Poland and Germany, but various complications prohibited their union. One of these was an affair Balzac had with his housekeeper, Louise Breugniot. As she became aware of his affection for Mme. Hanska, Breugniot stole a collection of their letters and used them to extort money from Balzac. Even after this episode, he grew closer to Mme. Hanska with each visit and by 1846 he had begun preparing a home to share with her. He grew hopeful that they could marry when she became pregnant, but she fell ill in December and suffered a miscarriage.

The mid-19th century was a time of profound transformation in French government and society. The reign of King Charles X ended in 1830 when a wave of agitation and dissent forced him to abdicate. He was replaced by Louis-Philippe, who named himself &quot;King of the French&quot;, rather than the standard &quot;King of France&quot; – an indication that he answered more to the nascent bourgeoisie than the aristocratic &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. The change in government took place while the economy in France was moving from mercantilism to industrial development. This opened new opportunities for individuals hoping to acquire wealth and led to significant changes in social norms. Members of the aristocracy, for example, were forced to relate socially to the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, usually with tense results. The democratic spirit of the French Revolution also affected social interactions, with a shift in popular allegiance away from the church and the monarchy.

In the mid-19th century, a new style of the novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the &quot;roman-feuilleton&quot; presented stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Vieille Fille&quot; (&quot;The Old Maid&quot;), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the &quot;roman-feuilleton&quot; gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, especially Sue&#x27;s socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called &quot;les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde&quot; (&quot;the false gods of this bastard literature&quot;). He also wanted to show the world that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was &quot;plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais&quot; (&quot;younger, fresher, and greater than ever&quot;). His first efforts to render a quality &quot;feuilleton&quot; were unsuccessful. Even though &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; (&quot;A Harlot High and Low&quot;), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was &quot;doing pure Sue&quot;. He tried again in 1844 with &quot;Modeste Mignon&quot;, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his &quot;own old pen again&quot;.

==Writing and publication==
After resting for a week in June 1846 at the Château de Saché in Tours, Balzac returned to Paris and began working on a short story called &quot;Le Parasite&quot;, which he eventually developed into the novel &quot;Le Cousin Pons&quot;. He intended from the start to pair it with another novel, collecting them under the title &quot;Les Parents pauvres&quot; (&quot;The Poor Relations&quot;). He based the second book on a story his sister Laure Surville had written called &quot;La Cousine Rosalie&quot; and published in 1844 in &quot;Le Journal des enfants&quot;. Writing intensively, he produced the entire novel, named &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; after the main character, in two months. This was a significant accomplishment owing to his bad health, but its length made Balzac&#x27;s writing speed especially remarkable. One critic calls the writing of &quot;Les Parents pauvres&quot; Balzac&#x27;s &quot;last explosion of creative energy&quot;. Another suggests that this effort was &quot;almost the last straw which broke down Balzac&#x27;s gigantic strength&quot;.

Balzac&#x27;s usual mode of revision involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs he received from the printer. When creating &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; from 8 October to 3 December, and Balzac rushed to keep up with the newspaper&#x27;s rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with &quot;Le Cousin Pons&quot; as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; in 1848.

==Plot summary==
Adeline Hulot – wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot – is being pressured into an affair by Célestin Crevel, a wealthy perfumer. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the attentions of singer Josépha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. Mme. Hulot rejects Crevel&#x27;s advances. The Baron has so completely lavished money on Josépha that he has borrowed heavily from his Uncle Johann – and, unable to repay the money, the Baron instead arranges a War Department post in Algeria for Johann, with instructions that Johann will be in a situation in that job to embezzle the borrowed money. The Hulots&#x27; daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel&#x27;s daughter Celestine.

Mme. Hulot&#x27;s cousin, Bette (also called Lisbeth), harbors a hidden resentment of her relatives&#x27; success, especially of Hortense &#x27;stealing&#x27; Bette&#x27;s intended sweetheart. A peasant woman with none of the physical beauty of her cousin, Bette has rejected various marriage proposals from middle-class suitors who were clearly motivated by her connection to the Hulots, and remains unmarried at the age of 42. One day, she comes upon a young unsuccessful Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own. As she nourishes him back to health, she develops a fondness for him. Bette is living in a modest apartment in a lodging house shared by the Marneffe couple. Bette befriends Valérie (née Fortin), the young wife of a War Department clerk, Jean-Paul-Stanislas Marneffe; the two women form a bond to attain their separate goals – for Valérie the acquisition of money and valuables, for Bette the ruination of the Hulot household by means of Valérie&#x27;s luring both the Baron and Steinbock into infidelity and financial ruin.

Baron Hulot, meanwhile, is rejected by Josépha, who explains that she has chosen another man because of his larger fortune. Hulot&#x27;s despair is alleviated when he visits Bette in her lodging and there meets and falls in love with Valérie Marneffe. He showers her with gifts, and soon establishes a luxurious house for her and M. Marneffe, with whom he works at the War Department (Bette joins them in their new home, to serve as an excuse for the Baron&#x27;s visits). These debts, compounded by the money he borrowed to lavish on Josépha, threaten the Hulot family&#x27;s financial security. Panicked, he convinces his uncle Johann Fischer to quietly embezzle funds from a War Department outpost in Algiers. Hulot&#x27;s woes are momentarily abated and Bette&#x27;s happiness is shattered, when Hortense Hulot marries Wenceslas Steinbock.

Crushed at having lost Steinbock&#x27;s as her intended spouse, Bette swears vengeance on the Hulot family. Her strategy is to work on Baron Hulot&#x27;s demonstrated weakness for acquiring and lavishing more money than he has on young mistresses. Soon the Baron is completely besotted – and financially over-extended – with Valérie, and compromised by repeatedly promoting her husband within the Baron&#x27;s section of the War Department. Before long, Bette has already contrived to have Crevel and Steinbock also ensnared by Valérie&#x27;s charms. Hortense discovers Steinbock&#x27;s infidelity and returns to her mother&#x27;s home. Before long, the Baron&#x27;s misconduct becomes known to the War Department; Uncle Johann is arrested in Algeria and commits suicide, the Baron is forced to retire, his brother, a famous war hero, saves him from prison and then dies of shame over the family disgrace. The Baron deserts his family and hides from his creditors. It appears that Valérie, soon a widow, will marry Crevel and thus gain entrance to the Hulot family as Celestine&#x27;s mother-in-law. In short, the family is devastated by these repeated blows – and Bette&#x27;s machinations are concealed from them.

==Characters and inspirations==
Balzac had written more than seventy novels when he began &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, and populated them with recurring characters. Many of the characters in the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac&#x27;s 1837 novel &quot;César Birotteau&quot;, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in &quot;Les Chouans&quot;. In the years between that story and &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, he became the Count of Forzheim; in a letter to the &quot;Constitutionnel&quot;, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot – among others – in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; allows a continuation of each character&#x27;s life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.

Other recurring characters appear only briefly in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;; previous appearances, however, give deep significance to the characters&#x27; presence. This is the case with Vautrin, the criminal mastermind who tutors young Eugene de Rastignac in Balzac&#x27;s 1835 novel &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;. When he resurfaces in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, he has joined the police and introduces the Hulot family to his aunt, Mme. Nourrison, who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes. Although Vautrin&#x27;s presence in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; is brief, his earlier adventures in &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; provide instant recognition and emotional texture. Elsewhere, Balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society. For example, several scenes feature artists like Jean-Jacques Bixiou, who first appeared in 1837&#x27;s &quot;Les Employés&quot; and in many other books thereafter. The world of Parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with the inclusion of several characters from &quot;Les Comédiens sans le savoir&quot; (1846), and Bianchon appears – as always – when a doctor is needed.

Balzac&#x27;s use of recurring characters has been identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. &quot;When the characters reappear&quot;, notes the critic Samuel Rogers, &quot;they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see.&quot; Some readers are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he &quot;did not know where to begin&quot;. The characterization in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book &quot;Balzac&#x27;s Recurring Characters&quot;, says that the technique is employed &quot;for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac&#x27;s later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation.&quot; Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; &quot;among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched&quot;.

===Bette Fischer===
Descriptions of Bette are often connected to savagery and animal imagery. Her name, for example, is a homophone in French for &quot;bête&quot; (&quot;beast&quot;). One passage explains that &quot;elle ressemblait aux singes habillés en femmes&quot; (&quot;she sometimes looked like one of those monkeys in petticoats&quot;); elsewhere her voice is described as having &quot;une jalousie de tigre&quot; (&quot;tiger-like jealousy&quot;). Her beastly rage comes to the surface with ferocity when she learns of Steinbock&#x27;s engagement to Hortense:

When she learns that her cousin Adeline has been welcoming Steinbock into the Hulot home, Bette swears revenge: &quot;Adeline! se dit Lisbeth, ô Adeline, tu me le payeras, je te rendrai plus laide que moi!&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Adeline!&#x27; muttered Lisbeth. &#x27;Oh, Adeline, you shall pay for this! I will make you uglier than I am.&#x27;&quot;) Her cruelty and lust for revenge lead critics to call her &quot;demonic&quot; and &quot;one of Balzac&#x27;s most terrifying creations&quot;. Because of her willingness to manipulate the people around her, Bette has been compared to Iago in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;. Her fierce persona is attributed partly to her peasant background, and partly to her virginity, which provides (according to Balzac) &quot;une force diabolique ou la magie noire de la volonté&quot; (&quot;diabolical strength, or the black magic of the Will&quot;).

In a letter to Mme. Hanska, Balzac indicated that he based the character of Bette on three women from his life: his mother, Mme. Hanska&#x27;s aunt Rosalie Rzewuska, and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. Balzac had a tumultuous relationship with his mother for most of his life, and he incorporated some of her personality (particularly her &quot;obstinate persistence in living&quot;, as one critic calls it) into Bette. Rosalie Rzewuska disapproved of Mme. Hanska&#x27;s relationship with Balzac; biographers agree that her cold determination was part of the author&#x27;s recipe for Bette. Elements taken from Marceline Desbordes-Valmore are more complex; she faced many setbacks in life and she and Balzac became friends after she left the theatre to take up poetry.

===Valérie Marneffe===
Bette&#x27;s co-conspirator in the destruction of the Hulot family is beautiful and greedy Valérie Marneffe, the unsatisfied wife of a War Department clerk. They develop a deep friendship, which many critics consider an example of lesbian affection. Because of their relationship and similar goals, the critic Frederic Jameson says that &quot;Valérie serves as a kind of &quot;emanation&quot; of Bette&quot;.

Valérie is repulsed by her ugly husband and has gone five years without kissing him. She explains bluntly that her position as a married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers&#x27; devotion, and this wickedness – not to mention her gruesome demise – has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac&#x27;s morality tale.

In one important scene, Valérie models for Steinbock as Delilah, standing victorious over the ruined Samson. With obvious parallels to her own activities, she describes her vision for the piece: &quot;Il s&#x27;agit d&#x27;exprimer la puissance de la femme. Samson n&#x27;est rien, là. C&#x27;est le cadavre de la force. Dalila, c&#x27;est la passion qui ruine tout.&quot; (&quot;What you have to show is the power of woman. Samson is a secondary consideration. He is the corpse of dead strength. It is Delilah—passion—that ruins everything.&quot;)

Although Balzac did not draw specifically from the women in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is similar in some ways to Valérie&#x27;s manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska&#x27;s pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie&#x27;s treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: &quot;je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu&#x27;un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie&quot; (&quot;I commit for [you] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, my honor, my life&quot;).

===Hector and Adeline Hulot===
Baron Hector Hulot is a living manifestation of male sexual desire, unrestrained and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; by the end of the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife – without irony – if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.

Adeline Hulot, on the other hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, she comes from a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, including devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has known for years about her husband&#x27;s infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline&#x27;s forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is partly to blame for Hulot&#x27;s wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness &quot;an inadequate and even positively disastrous response&quot; to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. &quot;[O]ne could at the very least offer the tentative speculation that Hulot&#x27;s obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot&#x27;s excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife.&quot; Others are less accusatory; Adeline&#x27;s nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows &quot;more imbecility than Christian patience&quot;, and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion – albeit of a different kind: &quot;Adeline&#x27;s desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire ...&quot;

Balzac&#x27;s inspiration for the characters of Hector and Adeline remain unclear, but several critics have been eager to speculate. Three officers named Hulot were recognized for their valor in the Napoleonic Wars, and some suggest that Balzac borrowed the name of Comte Hector d&#x27;Aure. None of these men, however, were known for the sort of philandering or thievery exhibited by Baron Hulot in the novel. Instead, Balzac may have used himself as the model; his many affairs with women across the social spectrum lead some to suggest that the author &quot;found much of Hulot in himself&quot;. Balzac&#x27;s friend Victor Hugo, meanwhile, was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in July 1845. The similarity of his name to Hector Hulot (and that of his wife&#x27;s maiden name, Adèle Foucher, to Adeline Fischer) has been posited as a possible indication of the characters&#x27; origins.

===Wenceslas Steinbock===
The Polish sculptor Wenceslas Steinbock is important primarily because of Bette&#x27;s attachment to him. He offers Bette a source of pride, a way for her to prove herself worthy of her family&#x27;s respect. When Hortense marries Steinbock, Bette feels as though she has been robbed. Prendergast insists that the incident &quot;must literally be described as an act of theft&quot;.

Steinbock&#x27;s relevance also lies in his background and profession, illustrating Balzac&#x27;s conception of the Polish people, as well as himself. Having spent more than a decade befriending Mme. Hanska and visiting her family in Poland, Balzac believed he had insight into the national character (as he felt about most groups he observed). Thus, descriptions of Steinbock are often laced with commentary about the Polish people: &quot;Soyez mon amie, dit-il avec une de ces démonstrations caressantes si familières aux Polonais, et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilité.&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Be my sweetheart,&#x27; he added, with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of servility.&quot;)

Critics also consider Steinbock important because of his artistic genius. Like Louis Lambert and Lucien Chardon in &quot;Illusions perdues&quot;, he is a brilliant man – just as Balzac considered himself to be. Before he is nurtured and directed by Bette, Steinbock&#x27;s genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide. Later, when he leaves Bette&#x27;s circle of influence, he fails again. Thus he demonstrates Balzac&#x27;s conviction that genius alone is useless without determination. Bellos organizes Steinbock and Bette into a duality of weakness and strength; whereas the Polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work, Bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying the lust to which Steinbock falls prey. Steinbock&#x27;s drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art, which gives him an inflated sense of accomplishment. One critic refers to the artist&#x27;s downfall as &quot;vanity ... spoiled by premature renown&quot;.

==Style==
If Balzac&#x27;s goal was (as he claimed) to write a realist novel from his &quot;own old pen&quot; rather than mimic the style of Eugène Sue, history and literary criticism have declared him successful. William Stowe calls &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; &quot;a masterpiece of classical realism&quot; and Bellos refers to it as &quot;one of the great achievements of nineteenth-century realism&quot;, comparing it to &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Some sections of the book are criticized for being melodramatic, and Balzac biographer V. S. Pritchett even refers to a representative excerpt as &quot;bad writing&quot;. Most critics consider the moralistic elements of the novel deceptively complex, and some point out that the &quot;roman-feuilleton&quot; format required a certain level of titillation to keep readers engaged. Others indicate that Balzac&#x27;s interest in the theatre was an important reason for the inclusion of melodramatic elements.

Balzac&#x27;s trademark realism begins on the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel&#x27;s geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette&#x27;s residence is on the opposite end of the social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: &quot;Les ténèbres, le silence, l&#x27;air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants.&quot; (&quot;Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.&quot;) Descriptions of her meager quarters are – as usual in Balzac&#x27;s work – an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains &quot;les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe&quot; (&quot;the illusory appearance of sham luxury&quot;), from the shabby chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.

Precise detail is not spared in descriptions of decay and disease, two vivid elements in the novel. Marneffe, for example, represents . His decrepit body is a symbol of society&#x27;s weakness at the time, worn away from years of indulgence. The poison which kills Valérie and Crevel is also described in ghastly detail. The doctor Bianchon explains: &quot;Ses dents et ses cheveux tombent, elle a l&#x27;aspect des lépreux, elle se fait horreur à elle-même; ses mains, épouvantables à voir, sont enflées et couvertes de pustules verdâtres; les ongles déchaussés restent dans les plaies qu&#x27;elle gratte; enfin, toutes les extrémités se détruisent dans la sanie qui les ronge.&quot; (&quot;She is losing her hair and teeth, her skin is like a leper&#x27;s, she is a horror to herself; her hands are horrible, covered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose, and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors.&quot;)

&quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; is unapologetic in its bleak outlook, and makes blunt connections between characters&#x27; origins and behavior. For these reasons, it is considered a key antecedent to naturalist literature. Novelist Émile Zola called it an important &quot;roman expérimental&quot; (&quot;experimental novel&quot;), and praised its acute exploration of the characters&#x27; motivations. Some critics note that &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; showed an evolution in Balzac&#x27;s style – one which he had little time to develop. Pointing to the nuance of plot and comprehensive narration style, Stowe suggests that the novel &quot;might in happier circumstances have marked the beginning of a new, mature &#x27;late Balzac&#x27;&quot;.

==Themes==

===Passion, vice, and virtue===
Valérie&#x27;s line about Delilah being &quot;la passion qui ruine tout&quot; (&quot;passion which ruins everything&quot;) is symbolic, coming as it does from a woman whose passion accelerates the ruin of most people around her – including herself. Baron Hulot, meanwhile, is desire incarnate; his wandering libido bypasses concern for his wife, brother, children, finances, and even his own health. Bette is living vengeance, and Adeline desperately yearns for the happy home she imagined in the early years of marriage. Each character is driven by a fiery passion, which in most cases consumes the individual. As Balzac puts it: &quot;La passion est un martyre.&quot; (&quot;Passion is martyrdom.&quot;)

The intensity of passion, and the consequences of its manifestation, result in a stark contrast of vice and virtue. Bette and Valérie are pure wickedness, and even celebrate the ruin of their targets. As one critic says, &quot;life&#x27;s truths are viewed in their most atrocious form&quot;. Mocking the use of the guillotine during the French Revolution while acknowledging her own malicious intent, Valérie says with regard to Delilah: &quot;La vertu coupe la tête, le Vice ne vous coupe que les cheveux.&quot; (&quot;Virtue cuts off your head; vice only cuts off your hair.&quot;) Hulot is not intentionally cruel, but his actions are no less devastating to the people around him.

On the other side of the moral divide, Adeline and her children stand as shining examples of virtue and nobility – or so it would seem. Hortense ridicules her aunt when Bette mentions her protégé Wenceslas Steinbock, providing a psychological catalyst for the ensuing conflict. Victorin repeatedly expresses outrage at his father&#x27;s philandering, yet crosses a significant moral boundary when he agrees to fund Mme. Nourrison&#x27;s plan to eradicate Valérie. As one critic puts it, Victorin&#x27;s decision marks a point in the novel where &quot;the scheme of right versus wrong immediately dissolves into a purely amoral conflict of different interests and passions, regulated less by a transcendent moral law than by the relative capacity of the different parties for cunning and ruthlessness.&quot; The cruelties of the Hulot children are brief but significant, owing as much to their obliviousness (intentional in the case of Victorin, who asks not to learn the details of Mme. Nourrison&#x27;s scheme) as to malicious forethought.

The question of Adeline&#x27;s virtue is similarly complicated. Although she is forgiving to the point of absurdity, she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr. Some have compared her to Balzac&#x27;s title character in &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, who sacrifices himself for his daughters. As Bellos puts it: &quot;Adeline&#x27;s complicity with Hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character, but it undermines her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel.&quot; This complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to Crevel (who has since lost interest) in order to repay her husband&#x27;s debts. Her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than Valérie&#x27;s overt extortion, since Adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of Baron Hulot&#x27;s infidelity. For the remainder of the novel, Adeline trembles uncontrollably, a sign of her weakness. Later, when she visits the singer Josépha (on whom her husband once doted), Adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction. She wonders aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures Hulot seeks outside of their home.

Ultimately, both vice and virtue fail. Valérie is devoured by Montés&#x27; poison, a consequence of her blithe attitude toward his emotion. Bette is unsuccessful in her effort to crush her cousin&#x27;s family, and dies (as one critic puts it) &quot;in the margins&quot;. Adeline&#x27;s Catholic mercy, on the other hand, fails to redeem her husband, and her children are similarly powerless – as Victorin finally admits on the novel&#x27;s last page. Like Raphael de Valentin in Balzac&#x27;s 1831 novel &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;, Hulot is left with nothing but &quot;vouloir&quot;: desire, a force which is essential for human existence and eventually apocalyptic.

===Gender and homoeroticism===

Gender roles, especially the figure of the ideal woman, are central to &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac&#x27;s study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father&#x27;s absence.

Critics pay special attention to Bette&#x27;s lack of traditional femininity, and her unconventional relationships with two characters. She is described from the outset as having &quot;des qualités d&#x27;homme&quot; (&quot;certain manly qualities&quot;), with similar descriptions elsewhere. Her relationship and attitude toward Steinbock, moreover, hint at her masculinity. She commands him into submission, and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture. Her domination is tempered by maternal compassion, but the couple&#x27;s relationship is compared to an abusive marriage: &quot;Il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les mauvais traitements d&#x27;une semaine à cause des caresses d&#x27;un fugitif raccommodement.&quot; (&quot;He was like a woman who forgives a week of ill-usage for the sake of a kiss and a brief reconciliation.&quot;)

Bette&#x27;s relationship with Valérie is layered with overtones of lesbianism. Early in the book Bette is &quot;captée&quot; (&quot;bewitched&quot;) by Valérie, and quickly declares to her: &quot;Je vous aime, je vous estime, je suis à vous!&quot; (&quot;I love you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours!&quot;) This affection may have been platonic, but neighbors of the Marneffes – along with many readers – suspect that their bond transcends friendship. As with Steinbock, Bette and Valérie assume butch and femme roles; the narration even mentions &quot;Le contraste de la mâle et sèche nature de la Lorraine avec la jolie nature créole de Valérie&quot; (&quot;The contrast between Lisbeth&#x27;s dry masculine nature and Valerie&#x27;s creole prettiness&quot;). The homoeroticism evolves through the novel, as Bette feeds on Valérie&#x27;s power to seduce and control the Hulot men. As one critic says: &quot;Valérie&#x27;s body becomes, at least symbolically, the locus of Bette&#x27;s only erotic pleasure.&quot;

===Wealth and society===
As with many of his novels, Balzac analyzes the influence of history and social status in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed significant changes in the social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.

Balzac demonstrated these beliefs through the characters&#x27; lives in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;. The conflict between Baron Hulot and the perfumer Crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; and the newly developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs. Although he despised the socialist politics of Eugène Sue, Balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from life&#x27;s important virtues. The characters – especially Bette, Valérie, and Crevel – are fixated on their need for money, and do whatever they must to obtain it. As Crevel explains to Adeline: &quot;Vous vous abusez, cher ange, si vous croyez que c&#x27;est le roi Louis-Philippe qui règne ... au-dessus de la Charte il y a la sainte, la vénérée, la solide, l&#x27;aimable, la gracieuse, la belle, la noble, la jeune, la toute-puissante pièce de cent sous!&quot; (&quot;You are quite mistaken, my angel, if you suppose that King Louis-Philippe rules us ... supreme above the Charter reigns the holy, venerated, substantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble, ever-youthful, and all-powerful five-franc piece!&quot;)

Themes of corruption and salvation are brought to the fore as Valérie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him to meet with a priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: &quot;la mort regarde à deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!&quot; (&quot;Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.&quot;) Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: &quot;je ne puis maintenant plaire qu&#x27;à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!&quot; (&quot;I can please no one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that will be my last flirtation ...!&quot;)

==Reception and adaptations==
The critical reaction to &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; was immediate and positive, which Balzac did not expect. Whether due to the intensity of its creation or the tumult of his personal life, the author was surprised by the praise he received. He wrote: &quot;I did not realize how good &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; is ... There is an immense reaction in my favour. I have won!&quot; The collected edition sold consistently well, and was reprinted nineteen times before the turn of the 20th century. 20th-century critics remain enthusiastic in their praise for the novel; Saintsbury insists it is &quot;beyond all question one of the very greatest of [Balzac&#x27;s] works&quot;. Biographer Graham Robb calls &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; &quot;the masterpiece of his premature old age&quot;.

Some 19th-century critics attacked the book, on the grounds that it normalized vice and corrupt living. Chief among these were disciples of the utopian theorist Charles Fourier; they disapproved of the &quot;immorality&quot; inherent in the novel&#x27;s bleak resolution. Critics like Alfred Nettement and Eugène Marron declared that Balzac&#x27;s sympathy lay with Baron Hulot and Valérie Marneffe. They lambasted him for not commenting more on the characters&#x27; degenerate behavior – the same stylistic choice later celebrated by naturalist writers Émile Zola and Hippolyte Taine.
Balzac&#x27;s novel has been adapted several times for the screen. The first was in 1928, when French filmmaker Max DeRieux directed Alice Tissot in the title role. Margaret Tyzack played the role of Bette in the five part serial &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; made in 1971 by the BBC, which also starred Helen Mirren as Valérie Marneffe. The film &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; was released in 1998, directed by Des McAnuff. Jessica Lange starred in the title role, joined by Bob Hoskins as Crevel, and Elisabeth Shue as the singer Jenny Cadine. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr changed the story significantly, and eliminated Valérie. The 1998 film was panned by critics for its generally poor acting and awkward dialogue. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the movie &quot;treats the novel as a thoroughly modern social comedy peopled with raging narcissists, opportunists and flat-out fools&quot;. The 1998 film changed the novel quite drastically, retaining the basic idea of Bette avenging herself on her enemies, and not only eliminating Valerie, but letting Bette survive at the end.

&quot;La Cousine Bette&quot; was adapted for the stage by Jeffrey Hatcher, best known for his screenplay &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; (based on his stage play &quot;Compleat Female Stage Beauty&quot;). The Antaeus Company in North Hollywood produced a workshop in 2008 and presented the world premiere of &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; in early 2010 in North Hollywood, California. The adaptation retains many of the main characters but places Bette as the story&#x27;s narrator.

<text>Absalom Tatom (1742 – December 20, 1802) was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina from 1795 to 1796.

==Biography==
Born in North Carolina in 1742, Tatom was a sergeant in the Greenville, North Carolina Militia in 1763; he served in North Carolina Militia during the American Revolutionary War, where he was commissioned first lieutenant on September 1, 1775, and promoted to the rank of captain June 29, 1776. He resigned from the Continental Army on September 19, 1776.

On August 15, 1778, Tatom enlisted as assistant quartermaster and keeper of the arsenal in the State service at Hillsborough, North Carolina; he was contractor for Hillsborough in 1778 and named major of detachment of the North Carolina Light Horse February 12, 1779.

In 1779, Tatom served as clerk of court in Randolph County; he was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons, but, because of his county clerk position, was disqualified from service in the legislature. In 1781, Tatom was district auditor for Hillsborough.

Tatom rose in state government; in 1782, he was one of three commissioners appointed by Congress to survey lands granted to Continental soldiers in the western territory (later Tennessee); that same year, he was a private secretary of Governor Thomas Burke and state tobacco agent. The Continental Congress named him surveyor of North Carolina in May 1785 and was named commissioner to sign State paper money in December 1785.

In 1788, Tatom was a delegate to the convention which considered ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1794, Tatom was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 4th United States Congress where he served from March 4, 1795, until his resignation on June 1, 1796. Tatom was later a member of the state House of Commons from 1797 to 1802; he died in Raleigh, North Carolina, in December 1802 and is buried in the Old City Cemetery.

<text>Greaves is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the southwest edge of Mare Crisium. It is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the center of the sloping inner walls. The crater is intruding into the northern edge of the lava-flooded crater Lick. To the northwest is Yerkes, and to the northeast is Picard.

This formation was previously designated Lick D, a satellite crater of Lick, before it was given a name by the IAU.

<text>Herigonius is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Oceanus Procellarum, to the northeast of the crater Gassendi. It was named after French mathematician and astronomer Pierre Hérigone. Herigonius is roughly circular, with an inward bulge and narrower inner wall along the northeast. In the interior of the sloping inner walls is a floor about half the diameter of the crater.

About 60 kilometers to the west of Herigonius is a sinuous rille designated Rimae Herigonius. This cleft is about 100 kilometers in length and runs generally in a north–south direction, while curving to the east at the north end.

Two mountains within a highland mass informally called &quot;The Helmet&quot; (by the Apollo 16 crew) are informally named Herigonius Eta (η) and Herigonius Pi (π). Eta is the larger mountain on the northern edge of the Helmet, and Pi is along the southwest edge. North and northwest of the crater is the wrinkle ridge Dorsa Ewing, which also contacts Rimae Herigonius.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Herigonius.

<text>HM Prison Loddon is an Australian low-medium security prison, located in Central Victoria, Australia, approximately four kilometres from the centre of Castlemaine and 128 km north-west of Melbourne.

Loddon is a campus-style prison, within a secure perimeter, providing accommodation for 468 medium-security prisoners. The landscaped grounds, modern buildings and wide range of programs and activities provide an environment and facilities which, as closely as possible, resembles those available in the general community.

In July 2014 Loddon prison expanded adding a new unit Middleton which is a restricted-minimum rated men&#x27;s prison. Prisoners at Middleton live in self-catered, cottage-style accommodation where they are responsible for cooking their own meals. Middleton has a capacity of 248.

== History ==
Loddon Prison was the second Victorian prison designed specifically for unit management (Barwon Prison was the first). Construction began in February 1988 and cost $29 million. The first prisoners arrived in August 1990 after the closure of the Old Castlemaine Gaol.

== Drug-free policy ==

Loddon was established as a drug-free prison from 1 July 1993. Additional procedures are in place to enforce the drug-free policy and to encourage prisoners to remain drug-free.

Prisoners at a drug-free prison must:
* Agree to undergo regular and random urine testing and participate in programs, as decided upon with case managers.
* Any prisoner at Loddon who tests positive to drugs or alcohol or refuses a urine test will be transferred immediately, as will any prisoner who is found guilty of a prison offence related to drugs or alcohol.

== Release of gorse spider mite ==
In 1998 as part of a biocontrol program, the gorse spider mite (Tetranychus lintearius) was first released on this site to control gorse (Ulex europaeus).

<text>The Pakistan Navy (PN) (; &quot;romanized&quot;: Pākistān Bahrí&#x27;a; ) is the naval warfare branch of the Pakistan Armed Forces. The Chief of the Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the navy and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. The Pakistan Navy operates on the coastline of Pakistan in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. It was established in August 1947, following the creation of Pakistan.

The primary role of the Pakistan Navy is to defend Pakistan&#x27;s sea frontiers from any external enemy attack. In addition to its war services, the Navy has mobilized its war assets to conduct humanitarian rescue operations at home as well as participating in multinational task forces mandated by the United Nations to prevent seaborne terrorism and piracy off the coasts.

The Pakistan Navy is a volunteer force which has been in conflict with neighbouring India twice on its sea borders. It has been repeatedly deployed in the Indian Ocean to act as a military advisor to Gulf Arab states and other friendly nations during the events of multinational conflict as part of its commitment to the United Nations. The Pakistan Navy has several components including Naval Aviation, Marines, and the Maritime Security Agency (a coast guard). Since its commencement, the defensive role of the navy has expanded from securing the sealines and becoming the custodian of Pakistan&#x27;s second strike capability with an ability to launch underwater missile system to target enemy positions.

The Chief of the Naval Staff is nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President of Pakistan. Admiral Naveed Ashraf is the incumbent chief since 7 October 2023.

==History==
===Division of the Royal Indian Navy in 1947===


The Pakistan Navy came into existence on 15 August 1947 with the establishment of Pakistan as an independent state from the United Kingdom. The Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee (AFRC), under Field Marshal Auchinleck, the last British Commander-in-Chief, India (C-in-C, India), divided the shares and assets of the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) between India and Pakistan in a ratio of 2:1, despite Pakistan having inherited the high percentage of delta areas on its coast and the large maritime area covering the Arabian sea on the West and the Bay of Bengal on the East. Pakistan received two sloops, two frigates, four minesweepers, two naval trawlers and four harbour launches. In addition, India also objected to transfer any machinery at the Bombay Dockyard to Pakistan and further refused to part the machinery that happened to be on its soil.

The navy endured a difficult beginningof only 200 officers and 3,000 sailors inherited, the most senior was Captain HMS Choudri, who had little experience in military staffing. Of the 200 officers, twenty had come from the executive branch of the Royal Indian Navy. Only six officers were mechanical engineers. There were no electrical engineers or specialists to care for the electrical systems used for weapons or other machinery. The navy suffered perennial problems with inadequate staff, lack of operational bases, lack of financial support, and poor technological and personnel resources. It was the smallest military branch, and lacked importance in federal budgeting.

Defence plans were based primarily from the point of view of the army and air force. The navy lacked facilities and maintenance machinery, as the only naval dockyard on the subcontinent was located in Bombay in India.

To overcome these difficulties, the navy launched a recruitment programme for the young nation, starting in East Pakistan. Sustaining the programme there proved difficult; therefore, it was moved to concentrate recruitment in West Pakistan. Furthermore, procurement was greatly determined by the navy&#x27;s role in previous wars. Most functions were in coastal defense and monitoring sea lanes, not in combat, making it difficult to justify spending on major weapons systems.

===The beginning: 1947–1964===
====Reorganization (1947–1964)====

The Navy&#x27;s combat actions largely remained in absence during the first war with India in 1947–48 as all the fighting was restricted to land and aerial combat missions. On operational planning, Captain HMS Choudri had engaged on commanding a former RIN destroyer from Karachi to Bombay to oversee the evacuation of Indian emigrants to Pakistan. In 1948, the Royal Pakistan Navy had to engage in humanitarian missions to evacuate Indian immigrants trapped in disputed and hostile areas, with its frigates operating continuously.

Command and control of the new Royal Pakistan Navy was extremely difficult as Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s administration had to extend the employment of a large number of the Royal Navy officers from the British Admiralty, with Rear Admiral James Wilfred Jefford, RN, appointed as the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) who worked on creating the contingency plan, &quot;Short-term Emergency Plan (STEP)&quot;, to work up the frigates and naval defences in case of escalation of the war at sea. In 1948, the Directorate-General for the Naval Intelligence (DGNI), a staff corps, was established under Lieutenant S. M. Ahsan, who served as its first Director-General, in Karachi. When the first war came to an end in 1948, the Navy temporarily established its Navy NHQ in Karachi and acquired its first O-class destroyer from the transfer by the Royal Navy.

The Royal Pakistan Navy greatly depended on the generous donations from the British Royal Navy with two s, and . &quot;Tippu Sultan&quot; was commissioned on 30 September 1949, under Commander P.S. Evans, whilst &quot;Tariq&quot; was placed under the command of Lieutenant-Commander A. R. Khan. The two destroyers formed the 25th Destroyer Squadron, as PNS &quot;Jhelum&quot; and PNS &quot;Tughril&quot;, under Commander Muzaffar Hasan, also joined the Royal Pakistan Navy.

In 1950, the Navy&#x27;s nationalisation took place when many officers from the air force and army volunteered to join the navy and NCOs gaining commission as an officers. Support from the army and air force to the navy led to the establishment of logistics and maintenance machinery with vigorous efforts directed towards integrating the navy presence in East Pakistan, thereby creating opportunities for people in East Pakistan to participate in the build-up.

In 1951, the Pakistan government called for appointing native chiefs of the armed forces, but it was not until 1953 that a native navy chief was appointed. The British Admiralty, however, maintained the command of the Navy through Rear-Admiral Jefford who had native deputy chiefs of staff including Commodore HMS Choudhri, Commodore Khalid Jamil, and Commander M.A. Alavi.

During this time, a number of goodwill missions were carried out by the navy&#x27;s warships, and non-combat missions were conducted under the auspices of the Royal Navy. In 1951, HMS Choudhri&#x27;s promotion papers as naval chief were approved by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan but it was not until 1953 when HMS Choudhri was promoted as vice admiral and commander with the support from army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan. He handed over the command of 25th Destroyer squadron to a Polish naval officer, Commander .

In the mid-1950s, the Ministry of Finance awarded contracts to the Corps of Engineers (Pakistan Army) for the construction of the Karachi Naval Dockyard. In 1954, several efforts were made to procure a Ch-class submarine from the Royal Navy but was rejected by British Admiralty which agreed to loan the , , which was renamed PNS &quot;Taimur&quot;. From 1953 to 1956, HMS Choudri bitterly negotiated with the United States over the modernisation of the navy and convinced the U.S. government to provide monetary support for modernisation of ageing O–class destroyers and minesweepers, while commissioning the Ch–class destroyers from the Royal Navy. British naval tradition was disbanded and cancelled when the United States Navy&#x27;s advisers were dispatched to the Pakistani military in 1955.

With the promulgation of the Constitution of Pakistan that established the republicanism featuring the federalised government, the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was dropped, and the service was re-designated the Pakistan Navy (&quot;PN&quot;) with the Jack replaced the Queen&#x27;s colour and the White Ensign respectively in 1956. The order of precedence of the three services changed from Navy–Army–Air force to Army–Navy–Air Force.

In February 1956, the British government announced the transfer of several major surface combat warships to Pakistan Navy, including a cruiser and four destroyers to be purchased with funds made available under the U.S. Military Assistance Program. In 1957, the Navy finalised the purchase of a cruiser from the United Kingdom and used the government&#x27;s own funds for the purchase which caused a great ire against Admiral Choudhri in the Finance Ministry.

In 1958, the Navy made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain s from Sweden using the American security funds; it was halted by the United States and Pakistan&#x27;s Finance Ministry despite the fact that the idea had support from Army GHQ. In 1958–59, the Navy NHQ staff began quarrelling with the Army GHQ staff and the Ministry of Defense (MoD) over plans regarding the modernisation of the navy that resulted in bitter interservice rivalry between army and navy and ended with Admiral Choudri&#x27;s resignation to the Presidency in 1959.

Proposal of attaining the aircraft carrier was deferred due to financial constraints, forcing Pakistan to move towards establishing the formidable submarine command. From 1956 to 1963, two destroyers, eight coastal minesweepers, and an oiler were procured from the United States and United Kingdom as a direct result of Pakistan&#x27;s participation in the anti-Communist defence pacts SEATO and CENTO.

===War with India and subsequent war deployments (1965–1970)===
After the bitter resignation of Vice-Admiral HMS Choudri in 1959, Vice-Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan was appointed as the Commander in Chief in Navy who worked towards building relations with President Ayub Khan in retaining hopes for procuring a submarine despite financial constraints. The Royal Navy accepted the long awaiting requests from the Pakistan Navy for a regular visit to Karachi Naval Dockyard to provide first hand experience in submarine operations in 1960–61. The Ayub administration did not increase the financial funding of the navy at the expense to army and air force but he did not object to American contributions to train the Pakistan Navy in submarine operations. It was the U.S. Navy that provided an insightful and crucial training support to Pakistan Navy enabling it to conduct operations in long range in the Indian Ocean and the proposal of procuring the submarine was met with favourable views in 1963 due to the prospect of the Soviet Navy leasing a submarine to the Indian Navy. After seeing the U.S. contribution, the United Kingdom decided to provide training and education to Pakistan Navy on submarine operations, and in 1964, was commissioned from the United States under the Security Assistance Program (SAP).

Even though, neither the Navy nor the Air Force was notified of the Kashmir incursion in 1965, the Navy was well-prepared at the time when the second war broke out between Pakistan and India in 1965. The naval chief Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan ordered all war units of the Pakistan Navy to take up defensive positions off the coast, but did not order any offensive operations in the Bay of Bengal. As the Indian Air Force&#x27;s repeated sorties and raids disrupted PAF operations, the Navy assumed a more aggressive role in the conflict. On 2 September, the Navy deployed its first long-range submarine, PNS &quot;Ghazi&quot; under Commander K. R. Niazi which was charged with gathering intelligence on Indian naval movements that stalked the diverting threats posed by the aircraft carrier .

On the night of 7/8 September, a naval squadron comprising four destroyers, one frigate, one cruiser, and one submarine, under the command of Commodore S. M. Anwar, launched artillery operation— an attack on the radar facilities used by the Indian Air Force in the small coastal town of Dwarka. The operation ended with limited damage to the area. After gunnery bombardment, was deployed against the Indian Navy&#x27;s Western Naval Command at Bombay on 22 September and ended her operations and reported safely back to Karachi Naval Dockyard on 23 September 1965.

The Pakistan Navy explored the idea of installing Russian missile system on former British frigates but Soviets refrained from doing so due to objections from India.

After the war, the United States imposed an arms embargo on Pakistan and Pakistani military began exploring options for military procurement from China, France, and Soviet Union. The United Kingdom offered the Navy to jointly built the Type 21 frigate but was rejected by Ayub administration that would only allow the financial capital to be spent on submarine procurement.

In 1966, the Pakistan Navy established its own special operations force, the Navy Special Service Group (Navy SSG) after the recommendations from the United States Navy. In 1966–70, Pakistan Navy had been well aware of massive procurement and acquisitions of weapon systems being acquired from the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, and the danger it will posed to Pakistan. In 1966–69, there were series of unsuccessful talks of acquiring the warships from the Soviet Navy which ended with no yielding results. The Soviet Union offered to sell their but Pakistan Navy wanted the Styx missiles to be installed in frigates in a believe that the missile boats were not big enough to meet the Pakistani requirements in operating in the Indian Ocean. The Russians later determined to their strategic interests lay with India and allowed the developing relationship with Pakistan to wither.

Difficulties arose between and after the arms embargo was lifted by the United States which lifted based strictly on cash-and-carry basis. Pleas for strengthening the Navy in East Pakistan were ignored due to monetary issues and financial constraints restricted the Navy&#x27;s capabilities to function more efficiently. In 1968, the s were procured from France while operating s that was refitted and upgraded by the Turkish Navy. Due to the Egyptian blockade of the Suez Canal, the Navy had to execute a notable submerged circumnavigation operation from the Indian Ocean through the Atlantic Ocean in order to undergo a refit program at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard in Turkey which was the only facility to manage the refitting and mid-life upgrades of military computers of the &quot;Tench&quot; class. Despite reservations harboring by the Navy NHQ about the ageing &quot;Ghazi&quot;, she was sailed under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim starting from the Karachi coast in Indian Ocean to Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, through the Atlantic Ocean and ended at the east coast of the Sea of Marmara where the Gölcük Naval Shipyard was located.

In 1968–69, the Navy NHQ staff began its tussle with the AHQ staff over the issue establishing the naval aviation who feared the loss of fighter jets and their pilots in the sea and was hostile towards this idea. The United States entered in discussing the transfer of P3B Orion aircraft to the Navy in 1970 with Yahya administration but were not procured until the end of the 1970s. In 1970, the foreign relations between Pakistan and East Pakistan further deteriorated and the Navy knew that it was impossible to defend East Pakistan from approaching Indian Navy. Series of reforms were carried when Navy&#x27;s serious reservations were considered by the Yahya administration and East Pakistanis were hastily recruited in what was known as Eastern Naval Command (Pakistan) but this proved to be disaster for Navy when majority of Bengali naval officers and ≈3,000 sailors defected to India to join the Awami League&#x27;s military wing– the &quot;Mukti Bahini&quot;. Such events had jeopardised the operational scope of the Navy and the Navy NHQ staffers and commanders knew very well that it (Navy) was ill-prepared for the war and Pakistan was about to learn the consequences of disconnecting strategy from reality.

===Indo-Pakistan war of 1971===
By 1971, the Navy NHQ staffers and their commanders knew very well that the Pakistan Navy was poorly represented in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and there was no main infrastructure to conduct defensive operation against the Eastern Naval Command of Indian Navy in Bay of Bengal. The Navy was only able conducted the riverine-based operations that was being undertaken by the Pakistan Marines with the assistance from the Navy Special Service Group, code named, Barisal, in April 1971. Although, the Governor of East Pakistan, Vice-Admiral S.M. Ahsan, made efforts to increase the naval presence and significance in 1969 but the Indian Navy&#x27;s Eastern Naval Command continued to pose a significant threat since it had capability of conduct operations in long-range areas.

Furthermore, the defections from Navy&#x27;s Bengali officers and sailors had jeopardise the Navy&#x27;s operational scope who went onto join the Awami League&#x27;s militant wing, the &quot;Mukti Bahini&quot; in a program known as &quot;Jackpot&quot;. Though, the program was disrupted by the Navy from further annihilation but the naval facilities were severely damaged due to this operation on 15 March 1971. East-Pakistan&#x27;s geography was surrounded by India on all three landward sides by the Indian Army as the Navy was in attempt to prevent India from blocking the coasts.

During this time, the Navy NHQ was housed in Karachi that decided to deploy the newly MLU &quot;Ghazi&quot; submarine on East while in West for the intelligence gathering purposes.

With no naval aviation branch to guard the Karachi port, the Indian Navy breached the seaborne borders of Pakistan and successfully launched the first missile attack, consisting of three Soviet-built s escorted by two anti-submarine patrol vessels on 4 December 1971. Nearing Karachi&#x27;s port area, the Indian Navy&#x27;s squadron launched Styx missiles anti-ship missiles, which the obsolescent Pakistani warships had no viable defence against. Two of the warships, and , were sunk, while was damaged beyond repair. After the attacks, the Indian Navy&#x27;s missile boat squadron safely returned to its home base without sustaining any damages.

On 8 December 1971, commanded by its Commander Ahmed Tasnim, sank the Indian frigate off the coast of Gujarat, India— this was the first sinking of a warship by a submarine since World War II, and resulted in the loss of eighteen officers and one-seventy six sailors of the Indian Navy while the inflicting severe damages to another warship, INS &quot;Kirpan&quot;, by the same submarine. The Pakistan Air Force now covering for Karachi made several of the unsuccessful attempts to engage the Indian Navy&#x27;s missile boat squadron by carrying out the aerial bombing missions over the Okha Harbor– the forward base of the Indian Navy&#x27;s missile boat squadron. The Indian Navy retaliated with a second missile attack on Pakistan&#x27;s coast on the night of 8 December 1971 when a small flotilla of Indian vessels, consisting of a missile boat and two frigates, approached Karachi and launched a missile attack that sank the Panamanian cargo ship &quot;Gulf Star&quot;, PNS &quot;Dacca&quot; and the British merchant ship SS &quot;Harmattan&quot; were damaged.

The missile-based attacks were the complete success for the Indian Navy, and a psychological trauma for Pakistan Navy, the human and material cost severely cutting into its combat capability, nearly 1,700 sailors perished at the barracks.

The commercial pilots from the Pakistan International Airlines volunteered to conduct air surveillance missions with the Pakistan Air Force, but this proved less than helpful when the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s forward observer team, led by Cdre. A. W. Bhombal misidentified their own larger frigate, , as an Indian missile boat, giving clearance to the F-86 fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force which made several attack runs before finally identifying &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; by the Navy NHQ. This serious friendly fire incident resulted in further loss of navy personnel, as well as the loss of the ship, which was severely damaged and the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s operational capabilities were now virtually extinct, and morale plummeted. The Indian Navy observers who watched the raid nearby later wrote in their war logs that the &quot;PAF pilots failed to recognize the difference between a large PNS &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; frigate and a relatively small Osa missile boat.&quot; The PAF, however, contested this claim by holding Cdre. Bhombal of the responsibility of misidentifying his own warship and giving clearance to the PAF to mount an attack on their own ship.

The Navy&#x27;s only long range submarine, &quot;Ghazi&quot;, was deployed to the area but, according to neutral sources, it sank en route under mysterious circumstances. Pakistani authorities state that it sank either due to internal explosion or detonation of mines which it was laying at the time. The Indian Navy claims to have sunk the submarine.

The submarine&#x27;s destruction enabled the Indian Navy to enforce a blockade on then East Pakistan. According to the defence magazine, &quot;Pakistan Defence Journal&quot;, the attack on Karachi, Dhaka, Chittagong and the loss of &quot;Ghazi&quot;, the Navy no longer was able to match the threat of Indian Navy as it was already outclassed by the Indian Navy after the 1965 war.

The damage inflicted by the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force on the Navy stood at seven gunboats, one minesweeper, two destroyers, three patrol craft, eighteen cargo, supply and communication vessels, and large-scale damage inflicted on the naval base and docks in the coastal town of Karachi. Three merchant navy ships; Anwar Baksh, Pasni and Madhumathi; and ten smaller vessels were captured. Around 1,900 personnel were lost, while 1413 servicemen (mostly officers) were captured by Indian forces in Dhaka. The Indian Navy lost 18 officers and 176 sailors and a frigate, while another frigate was damaged and a Breguet Alizé naval aircraft was shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.

According to one Pakistan scholar, Tariq Ali, the Pakistan Navy lost half its force in the war. Despite the limited resources and manpower, the Navy performed its task diligently by providing support to inter-services (air force and army) until the end.

According to the testimony provided by the Admiral Mohammad Shariff in 2015, the primary reason for this loss has been attributed to the High Command&#x27;s failure in defining a role for the Navy, or even considering Navy as military in general. Since then the Navy has sought to improve the structure and fleet by putting special emphasis on sub-surface warfare capability as it allows for the most efficient way to deny the control of Pakistani sea lanes to an adversary. In a thesis written by Dr. P. I. Cheema in 2002, Ayub Khan, who had enjoyed considerable influence on Pakistan&#x27;s national politicians, did not fully understood the Navy as a military service or neither comprehend the importance of safeguarding the sea lines of communication, which prevented the development of the Navy as a potent force as it should have in the 1970s.

===Restructuring and building towards modern Navy: 1972–1989===
After 1971 war, steps were taken to modernise and increase the operational scope of the Navy. Unlike the army or the air force, the naval officers were able to continue their military service with the Navy, and their promotions were relatively quicker than other military branches in 1972–74.

In January 1972, the Bhutto administration formed the POW Commission to investigate the number of war prisoners held by the Indian Army in East and submitted the request to the Supreme Court of Pakistan to investigate the causes of the war failure with India in 1971. After concluding a quick visit in the United States in 1972, President Bhutto used his administrative powers to dishonorably discharge the commission of five senior admirals in the Navy, appointing the junior most H. H. Ahmed as the first Chief of Naval Staff of the Navy. In 1973, the Navy NHQ was permanently moved to Islamabad to provide synergy with the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi.
In 1974, the Naval Aviation branch was established with the transfer of the Westland Sea King helicopters from the United Kingdom in 1975, followed by test firing the surface-to-ship Exocet missile as a befitting response to the Indian Navy in 1979. With the ability to fire the land-based Exocet missile from a reconnaissance aircraft, the Navy became the first of its kind in the South Asia to acquire land-based ballistics missile capable long range reconnaissance aircraft.

In 1976, the Navy moved towards successfully acquiring the military computers from the British firm, the Ferranti, to increase its defence&#x27;s for its coastlines. The War Enquiry Commission noted the lack of strategic communication and the grand strategy between the four-branches of the military during the conflict and wars with India, recommending the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee to maintain strategic military communication between the inter-services and the federal government, that is to be chaired by the appointed Chairman joint chiefs as the government&#x27;s principal military adviser. In 1976, Navy saw its first four-star rank admiral when Mohammad Shariff was promoted to this rank, and later becoming the first admiral to be appointed as the Chairman of Joint Chiefs Committee in 1977. In 1977, the United States reportedly transferred the two refitted to the Pakistan Navy, which were much superior to the British frigates, followed by obtaining more destroyers from the U.S. Navy in 1982–83.

During this time, the Navy to diversify its procurement with defence deals made with China, France, and the United Kingdom but the dependence grew on China when the Navy acquired the anti-submarine warships that gave the Navy credible sea-denial capability. In 1979, the France offered to sell their &quot;Agosta-70A&quot;-class submarine and was immediately acquired which were commissioned as and . Induction of the &quot;Agosta-70A&quot; class gave Pakistan Navy a depth advantage over the Indian Navy, and gave the Navy an ability to conduct operations in deeper Indian Ocean at wider range.

In 1982, the Reagan administration submitted the proposal of US$3.2 billion aid for Pakistan that was aimed towards economic uplift and security assistance to the United States Congress as the Navy entered in successful negotiation of obtaining the Harpoon system, despite the strong Indian lobby opposing and objecting of this deal. In 1985, the Navy bought the Mirage 5V aircraft for the naval role and were equipped with the Exocet A39 missile that gives the capability of sea denial to the Pakistan Navy. With the induction of the missile systems, long-range and depth endurance submarines, missiles destroyers, fighter aircraft, and establishment of the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency, the Pakistan Navy eventually ended the Indian Navy&#x27;s control over the Indian Ocean, and the Indian Navy&#x27;s confidence that it could contain the Pakistan Navy at shorelines.

Eventually, the Pakistan Navy began its wartime deployment in Middle Eastern countries through the Persian Gulf and deployed its war assets in Saudi Arabia in support of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s fleet in wake of the events involving the Iran–Iraq War and tensions with Libya. In 1982, the Reagan administration approved US$3.2 billion military and economic aid to Pakistan with Pakistan acquiring eight and frigates from the United States Navy on a five-year lease in 1988. A depot for repairs, followed the lease of these ships in April 1989. This was done due to the Zia administration&#x27;s co-operation with the Reagan administration against the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion in Afghanistan.

===Self reliance, engagement and covert operations (1990–1999)===

After the Russian troops withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the Bush administration imposed the arms embargo on Pakistan by uncovering the existence of the covert atomic bomb program to the United States Congress, which ultimately refrained the transfer of the maritime patrol aircraft, missile systems, and defence software on 1 October 1990. With the expiration of the lease of the and guided missile frigates, the Navy had to return the frigates to the United States that were sold to India for scrapped metals, and Navy to faced the problems for adequate funding towards the modern Navy. The embargo seriously impaired the Navy&#x27;s operational scope and paralysed its ability to operate in the Indian Ocean, since the Navy&#x27;s fleet was composed of entirely the former U.S.-built warships.

Since 1987, the Pakistan Navy had been interested in acquiring the Type 21 frigates from the United Kingdom, and the Navy turned to the Royal Navy for an immediate purchase which was approved in 1993 whose expensive refitting and technological upgrades had to carried out by Pakistan itself at their Naval Base in Karachi over the years. In 1994, the Pakistan Navy entered in lengthy, complicated, and controversial negotiation with France to acquire the long-range submarine technology by dismissing the idea of procuring nuclear-powered submarine from China due to noise issue that the Indian Navy was quiet able to track. Despite embargo, the United States Navy maintained its relations with Pakistan Navy, inviting the Pakistanis to participate in the &quot;Inspired Siren&quot; in 1994, and gave the Pakistan Navy instructions and run down on the nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier operations. In an attempt to warm the political relations with the United States, the Pakistani military joined the U.S. actions in the Somali Civil War, conducting wartime patrol in the Somali coast.
In 1994, the Navy was deployed in support of the U.S. Navy and extended its support in 1995 to participate in Operation United Shield to conclude its side of operation after evacuating personnel and equipment of the army, marines, and air force. By 1996, the Brown amendment was introduced that allowed the uplifting of the embargo on Pakistan, allowing the transfer of the maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy.

By 1997, the controversy over the technology transfer from France had tarnished the public image of the Navy with the arrest of naval chief when several cases were levelled on political and military leadership of the Navy. Despite India&#x27;s strong objections in France, the air-independent propulsion was transferred to Pakistan which built the , capable to operating in Indian Ocean and at higher submarine depth. In 1999, the Navy saw the public disagreement with the federal government over the issue of Pakistan Army&#x27;s engagement with Indian Army in Kashmir and over the rightful appointment of the Admiral Fasih Bokhari as Chairman joint chiefs. Pakistan Navy was forced to deploy its existing war assets when the Indian Navy deployed its warships near Korangi Creek Cantonment and Port of Karachi with their codename: &quot;Operation Talwar&quot;.

On 10 August 1999, a serious incident took place in Sir Creek region when the Indian Air Force shot down the Naval Aviation aircraft that resulted in deaths of 16 naval personnel, mostly officers. On 29 August 1999, another aircraft of the Navy, P3C Orion, was lost due to an accident with the loss of twenty one lives.

Over the issue of the Indian Air Force&#x27;s shot down of the aircraft, the Navy filed a lawsuit against the Indian Air Force at the International Court of Justice, but the claim was later dismissed due to over-reaching of the court&#x27;s mandate.

After his incident in 1999, another proposal was raised to switched the air-independent propulsion of Agosta submarine to substitute with nuclear propulsion, however the proposal was dismissed.

====War on Terror in Afghanistan and operations in North-West (2001–present)====


After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the sanctions on Pakistan were eventually uplifted, allowing the Navy to procure the U.S.-built weapon systems and warships to regain its ability to operate in the Indian Ocean as it became involved in war preparations during the standoff with India in 2001–02. In 2001, the Navy took serious consideration of deploying the nuclear weapons on its submarines although none of the nuclear weapons were ever deployed in the submarines.

In 2003–04, there were several proposals made for acquiring the vintage aircraft carriers but the Navy itself had dismissed the idea since the country has not aspired to have an aircraft capability. In 2002–03, the Pakistan Navy deployment took place in the Indian Ocean, participating in the naval drills to combat terrorism from seaborne platforms, and eventually entered in defence negotiations with China for acquiring the technology to designing and building the guided missile frigates— the F-22P guided missile frigates were eventually built it in 2006–15.

Since 2004, the Navy&#x27;s deployment took place in Indian Ocean, playing a crucial role in the multinational NAVCENT in Bahrain, and took the leadership of the CTF-150 and CTF-151 as well as taking active participation in the Operation Enduring Freedom in 2006–10. In 2008, the task force group consisting of , , , and the Pakistan Air Force&#x27;s Explosive Ordnance Disposal participated in the &quot;Exercise Inspired Union&quot; with the U.S. Navy in the Indian Ocean to develop skills in a prevention of seaborne terrorism.

Its deployment in the War on terror also included their actions in the War in Afghanistan when the Navy&#x27;s special forces were deployed to take participation in the Operations: &quot;Black Thunderstorm&quot;, &quot;Rah-i-Nijat&quot;, &quot;Mehran&quot;, and the &quot;Help&quot;.

Despite its seaborne mission, the Navy had played an active role in controlling the insurgency in former tribal belt in Western Pakistan, mostly taking roles in managing logistics and intelligence gathering as well as conducting ground operations with the army in Western areas to track down the al-Qaeda operatives. From 2010 to 2011, the Navy was in a brief direct conflict with the violent TTP group and al-Qaeda, and its Naval Intelligence was able to track down the infiltrated militants within the ranks of the Navy.

In 2015, the Navy was deployed in support of the Saudi-led blockade of Yemen after accepting the request from the Saudi Arabia. As of current, the Navy continues increase its operational scope in the Indian Ocean and reportedly successfully entering in defence talks with Turkey to jointly built the MILGEM project in Pakistan in 2018–2019 while it had earlier announced to start the building the program of the nuclear submarine for its current operational capabilities in 2013.

==Organization, Naval Headquarters==
===Principal Staff Commands and Principal Staff Officers===

Leadership in the Navy is provided by the Minister of Defense, leading and controlling the direction of the department of navy from the Naval Secretariat-II at the Ministry of Defense, with the Defense Secretary who is responsible for the bureaucratic affairs of the army&#x27;s department. The Constitution sets the role of the elected President of Pakistan as the civilian Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces while the Prime Minister of Pakistan served as the Chief Executive of the Pakistan Armed Forces, both the people-elected civilians, the President and Prime minister, maintains a civilian control of the military.

The Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), an appointed four-star rank admiral, is a principal military adviser on the naval/maritime security affairs to the Federal government and is a senior member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC)— a military body that advises and briefs the elected civilian Prime Minister and its executive cabinet on national security affairs and operational military matters under the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.

The war functions of the Navy is controlled from the single combat headquarters, the Navy NHQ, located in Islamabad at vicinity of the Joint Staff Headquarters and the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi Cantonment in Punjab in Pakistan. The Chief of Naval Staff controls and commands the Navy at all levels of operational command, and is assisted by number of Principal Staff Officers (PSOs) (Staff Commanders) who are commissioned at the three-star rank and two-star rank admirals. The Staff Appointments marked in the light goldish yellow color are the most important seats at NHQ which play a very important administrative role for the proper functioning of the Pakistan Navy and its assets.

Due to the influence from the Royal Navy and later by the United States Navy since its earliest inception, the Pakistan Navy has a unique command structure and the navy&#x27;s functionality is divided in various branches.

There are seven military staff commands in the navy that are in fact administrative, directed by the several appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS) and often assisted by the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (ACNS) holding the rank of commodore a one-star rank senior officer reporting directly to their respective Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS). The Deputy Chiefs Of Naval Staff are usually holding either the two-star or three-star ranks.The each and appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff head or commander of their respected branch reports directly to the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) at Navy NHQ in Islamabad of their respected command.

The military administration of the Navy under the Naval Chief based in the Navy NHQ includes its Principal Staff Commands and Principal Staff Officers:
===Organizations and Heads of Services, Pakistan Navy===
The Organizations and the Heads of Services operating in the Pakistan Navy and reporting directly to the Naval Chief are as follows:

===Naval components and branches===
Each branch in the navy offers specialisation and officers interested in joining the particular service have to pass aptitude tests before attending the specialised school that usually last for two to three years, in which the officer is able to attain a college degree.

=== Naval Commands in Field and Commanders ===
Since its restructuring and reorganisation over the several years, the Pakistan Navy now operates eight operational and tactical field commands and also two major type commands, two of the important commands of aviation and submarines are reporting directly to the senior Pakistan Fleet Command. Each command is headed by a senior flag officer who usually holds a ranks of three-star rank: Vice-Admiral and two-star rank: Rear-Admiral. The appointment to the senior fleet commander known as Commander, Pakistan Fleet leads the navy&#x27;s entire fleet with a responsibility of deploying the entire combat formations of the navy.

Geographically, there are three administrative commanders, such as Commander Karachi (COMKAR), Commander Central Punjab (COMCEP), and Commander Northern (COMNOR), who administer the bulk of naval installations, offshore establishments, and training facilities besides the seven oceanic based commands.

In 2012, the Pakistan Navy established the Naval Strategic Forces Command that has area responsibility of exercising the deployment of sea-borne nuclear weapons and is described by the military as the &quot;custodian of the nation&#x27;s nuclear second strike capability.&quot;

The peacetime commands and the Commands in the Navy allocated are given below.

===Special operations forces===

The Special Service Group Navy (SSG(N)), colloquially known as the SSGN is an elite unit that conducts unconventional warfare, combat diving, naval interdiction, and asymmetric warfare operations, established under the guidance of the United States Navy&#x27;s SEALs in 1966.

The Navy Special Service Group is headquartered at PNS Iqbal in Karachi where the physical conditioning and weapon tactics training take place. The Navy Special Service Group&#x27;s specialisation further includes training and mastery in the visit, board, search, and seizure methods, naval interdiction, and security operations to prevent seaborne-based terrorism.

The Navy Special Service Group is a tighter unit composed of highly qualified and selected personnel who are modelled on and inspired by the U.S. Navy SEALs training and tradition. The actual number of personnel of Navy Special Service Group is classified and their deployment are also subjected to classified information.

In 1970–71, the Navy established the Pakistan Marines to support the amphibious warfare operations and were initially influenced by the United States Marines Corps but the Marines component was decommissioned by the federal government in 1974. On 14 April 1990, the Pakistan Marines were again recommissioned in the Navy with about 2,000 personnel. The advanced training of the Marines are often takes place with the Pakistan Army at their School of Infantry and Tactics in Quetta in Balochistan.

The 1st Marines Battalion, the special operation unit, of the Pakistan Marines is specifically trained by the Pakistan Army to conduct infiltration and anti-aircraft warfare operations. The 1st Battalion is currently deployed in Sir Creek.

==Military philosophy==
===Combat doctrine===

The military doctrine and philosophy of the Pakistan Navy is primarily directed towards preventing the Indian Navy repeating the 1971 blockade of the Pakistani coasts. From 1947 until 1971, the Pakistan Navy was effectively little more than a coast guard because the Government of Pakistan did not give importance to the strategy of protecting the sea lines of communication. In 1971, the Indian Navy ultimately played a decisive role by enforcing a blockade of Chittagong and Karachi, the only maritime outlets of East Pakistan and West Pakistan respectively. The Navy was unable to break the blockade leading to Pakistan&#x27;s economic and military resources being severely drained and communication was limited between the two wings of the country. Subsequently, the federal government increased the funding of the Navy.

Since 1971 the Navy tactical doctrine has included the acquisition, development, employment, and aggressive deployment of the long-range and depth reaching submarines in an effort to target and destroy its adversaries by attacking surface warships before reaching the country&#x27;s ports. The mining of the Karachi&#x27;s harbour is also taken as a serious consideration of preventing the enemy from launching the missile attacks in the port city of Karachi.

In 1983–85, the Navy commissioned the Dassault Mirage 5 from France whose weapon system included the naval variant of the Exocet missiles and are aimed towards engaging the Indian Navy&#x27;s aircraft out to in the Indian Ocean.

The routine deployment of the surface fleet as part of the Combined Task Forces provides the opportunity to the safeguard the sealines of communications. Since 1999, the Pakistan Marines&#x27;s special reconnaissance forces has been deployed in the Sir Creek region are aimed towards offshore protection against the incursions from the Indian Army&#x27;s Para Commandos from the sea while taking the initiatives of deployment of the special forces groups behind the enemy lines through insertion by the HALO/HAHO airdrop or by using the midget submarines.

Responding to the development of the INS Arihant, the Pakistan Navy reportedly announced the launch of the nuclear powered submarine program to counter the submarine threat in 2012.

The Navy eventually pushed for attaining the naval-based nuclear second-strike capability in 2017 when the ISPR announced the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s to have attained the sea-based second strike capability when it launched the nuclear SLCM based on the Babur cruise missile, though the range of the SLCM remains to be at the short range.

==Equipment==
===Ships: Surface combatants===


The names of the commissioned warship and noncombat vessels of the Pakistan Navy are prefixed with the capital letters &quot;PNS&quot;— the Pakistan Navy Ship. The naming convention of the ship are selected by the Ministry of Defense, often honouring the important people or places in the history of Pakistan, and then commissioned by the President of Pakistan.

The Surface Fleet, established in 1947, is a pivotal component of the Navy with crucial role in maintaining the military balance with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, taking part in multinational task forces to prevent seaborne terrorism and piracy.

The Navy currently operates approximately 100 vessels including ones used by the Maritime Security Agency (MSA) and Pakistan Marines. In the current inventory, the Navy has a combination of Turkish, American, Chinese and locally produced ships including the American , Turkish-designed Babur class, and locally-built (built with Chinese assistance). Decommissioning of the ageing destroyer has been completed after the construction of additional missile guided s in Pakistan by 2021 and the acquisition of the Type 054A frigates from China that started in 2017.

The &quot;Tariq&quot; class were a class of guided missile destroyers that were in the service with the 25th Destroyer Squadron. The F-22P &quot;Zulfiquar&quot; class guided missile frigates are attached with the 18th Destroyer Squadron with a complement of the American-transferred (now PNS &quot;Alamgir&quot;) in 2011.

In 1992, the French Navy transferred its and helped designed the s in Pakistan as a local production that increased the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s operational scope and its overall capabilities.

In 2011, the Navy commissioned the &quot;Azmat&quot;-class corvette based on the Chinese design of Type 037II Houjian missile boat with the lead boat being designed in China while three remaining were built in Pakistan through the technology transfer agreement– these missile boats are commissioned into the 10th Patrol Squadron. In addition, the 10th Patrol Squadron has commissioned the two &quot;Jurrat&quot;-class missile boats based on the German-designed and two missile boat based on the from the Turkish design, MRTP. The &quot;Larkana&quot;-class gunboats are locally produced at the KSEW Ltd. in Karachi that is in the current service with the Pakistan Navy, forming the Fast Patrol Craft Squadron.

In addition to the Navy&#x27;s operations of warships, the Navy operates coast guard ships intended for the Maritime Security Agency – most are imported from China while others are locally build to guard the Pakistan&#x27;s seaborne borders from illegal activities, followed by the ten of the locally designed and built patrol boats for the Coast Guards for the safety and policing of the beaches in the country.

In 2017, the Pakistan Navy entered in discussion with the Turkish Navy to acquire four of the MILGEM-class warship, and eventually signing a major defence deal based on a technology transfer with Turkey on 5 July 2018, which was described as &quot;the largest defense export of Turkey in one agreement.&quot;

The Pakistan Navy Fleet Tanker Project (PNFT), of which STM, one of Turkey&#x27;s leading companies in the defence industry, is the prime contractor, joined the Pakistan Navy in 2018.

On 1 June 2018, Pakistan Navy ordered four Type 054As. The ships are expected to enter service by 2021.

The steel-cutting ceremony for the second Type 054A frigate for the Pakistan Navy (PN) was held in China on 19 December 2018, marking the beginning of construction of the vessel at the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai, China.

On 1 November 2019, China&#x27;s Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding held a steel cutting ceremony for the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s third and fourth Type 054A frigates.

Pakistan Navy outgoing Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi said Navy will add more than 50 vessels, including 20 major ships, to its fleet as part of an ambitious modernisation plan to improve its capabilities. 

Navy would operate four modified Ada class corvette&#x27;s from Turkey, two multi-purpose Yarmook class corvettes built by Dutch shipbuilder Damen Shipyards and twenty fast attack missile boats.

===Submarines===

Established in 1964, the Submarine Command is a major component of the Navy whose primary mission is to conduct clandestine military reconnaissance for intelligence and carry out precision strikes on enemy positions from underwater during war.

There are eight submarines in active service including the submarines, based on the &quot;Agosta-70A&quot; class, and three Italian–designed and locally–built midget (designated as X-Craft) submarines. The submarines are powered with diesel-electric and air-independent propulsion.

The &quot;Agosta-class&quot; submarines are equipped with an air-independent propulsion system giving a capability of deeper dives and the ability to submerge for a longer period of time without detection. They are armed with Exocet and Babur-III missiles, which can be launched from underwater. Two of the three &quot;Agosta-90B&quot; class have undergone refitting and modernisation by the Turkish firm, STM.

In 2014, Pakistan Navy entered in defence discussions with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy for the procurement of the Yuan-class AIP powered submarines, and eventually succeeded when the technology transfer agreement was signed between two nations in April 2015. This national submarine program is known as features air-independent propulsion is being constructed as a joint-venture with China with the expectation of being commissioned between 2023 and 2028. In a direct response to , the Pakistan Navy eventually succeeded getting the proposal approved for building the nuclear-powered submarine whose delivery is expected to between 2028, according to the Pakistan Navy officials.

In April 2014, the Navy announced that submarine operations would move from Naval Base Karachi to the new Jinnah Naval Base in Ormara.

Submarine training takes place at PNS &quot;Abdoze&quot; in Karachi. In May 2008, the Navy established the Fleet Acoustic Research and Classification Centre to validate submarine safety standards and to act as an underwater listening post to track unauthorised submarines.

===Auxiliaries, mine countermeasures, and amphibious warfare===
The Navy has six replenishment oil tankers, three minehunters, and four Griffon 2000TD hovercraft for the amphibious warfare. The Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) are the important and center pieces for the amphibious operations undertaken by the Marines and expeditionary actions by the Army as the two of the LCMs are commissioned by the Navy after being handed over by the KSEW Ltd. in 2016.

In 1987, the Pakistan Navy commissioned , the , fleet tanker from China that was followed by the commissioning of , of the &quot;Poolster&quot; class, from the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1988. In 1995, &quot;Poolster&quot;-class PNS &quot;Moawin&quot; was subjected to a serious fire accident that claimed valuable life during the refitting of the vessel in Karachi. The Navy also operates two coastal tankers that were indigenously designed and locally built at the Karachi Shipyard— PNS &quot;Gwadar&quot; and PNS &quot;Kalmat&quot;— commissioned in 1984 and in 1992. In 2011, the Navy commissioned two more small tankers/utility ships (STUS) —PNS &quot;Madadgar&quot; and PNS &quot;Rasadgar&quot; —to support the logistics and marine operations in the open sea.

In 1992, the Navy increased its operational capabilities in mine countermeasures with the commissioning of from the French Navy, followed by the technology transfer to Pakistan which led the commissioning of two more mine countermeasure vessels from in 1996 and 1998. Together with the &quot;Munsif&quot;-class minehunters and the replenishment oil tankers, these classes of ships are commissioned and complemented in the 9th Auxiliary Squadron. In 2018, the Pakistan Navy commissioned another which was locally engineered and constructed from the crucial design guidance from Turkey – the fleet tanker is noted for being the largest warship ever built in Pakistan.

In 2011, the Pakistan Navy established the 21st Auxiliary Squadron to further support its fleet&#x27;s logistics operations to fulfill the requirements of hydrological survey in the ocean, and the dredging operations in the area of responsibility that includes the training requirements for the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s personnel at the deeper ocean which is conducted by a dedicated Sail Training Vessel. The 21st Auxiliary Squadron consists of , a tall ship acquired from the United Kingdom in 2010, PNS &quot;Behr Khusha&quot;, a dredging vessel commissioned from China in 2008, and , that was commissioned from Japan in 1983.

===Aircraft===
The Aircraft in the Pakistan Navy provides the logistical support to the navy&#x27;s readiness at all level of commands and serves as the supply platform, through helicopters, to conduct the search and rescue, special operations, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and the anti-surface warfare (ASuW). Unlike the Indian Navy, the Pakistan Navy does not have the rapid aircraft carrier based strike capability but relies its aerial strike operations from clear and traditionally long landing platform built at the Mehran Naval Air Station in Karachi.
After realising the failure to protect the harbour from the attacks of the Indian Navy in 1971, the Navy took the research on using the aircraft on sea in an attempt to lessen the dependence on the Pakistan Air Force, which already covers the airspace of Pakistan, and established the naval aviation branch, the Naval Air Arm, in 1974. whose initial pilot training takes place at the PAF Academy in Risalpur.

The Navy operates the Lockheed P-3 Orion, ATR 72 and Hawker 800 as their fixed-wing aircraft inventory. The rotary-wing aircraft in the naval air arm includes the Harbin Z-9 and the Westland Sea King. In addition, there are numbers of aircraft active in the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (MSA).

===Weapon systems and Air defence===
Current weapon systems in the Pakistan Navy is entirely composed and focused towards missiles, serving as both weapons or a defence from a threat.

In 1971 with the Indian Navy&#x27;s introduction of anti-ship missiles, Navy had the strong emphasis on classically using the artillery and ammunition focusing towards the vintage tactics witnessed in the previous naval wars fought in the World War II.

The Navy&#x27;s primary air defence included the usage of the CAMM-ER, LY-80, FM-90, FN-16, Anza and the Mistral system.

The primary and standard rifle issued for the Navy is the POF G3P4, which is standard issue by the Ministry of Defense, and is based on the German design of the Heckler and Koch G3 rifle.

The Navy&#x27;s ground based air defence is entrusted with the Pakistan Marines who received their weapons training at the School of Infantry and Tactics in Quetta with the Pakistan Army.

In 2016, the Navy inducted the Harbah cruise missile, based on the Babur design, that was test fired from the PNS Himmat– the missile boat. The Navy operates the Zarb cruise missile that was first test fired on 10 April 2016.

The cruise missiles system in the Navy, the Harbah and Babur–III are the variants and derivatives of the improved version of the first cruise missile that entered in the service of the Pakistan Army— the Babur cruise missile system.
* FN-16, the man-portable air-defense systems, tested on 25 December 2010 by Pakistan Marines with a range of 6 km and altitude ≈3.5 km.
* Mistral shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile, test fired on 25 December 2010 by Pakistan Marines.

The military uniform in the Pakistan Navy includes the full white-worn service uniform as seen in the footage, and is worn on regular basis by the senior ranking star officers in the Navy. In the past times of 1947–2012, the Navy&#x27;s uniform had closely followed the uniforms issued in the British Royal Navy with star officers often wearing the full white dress while the junior officers to enlisted members only wearing dressed-up blue working uniforms as their authorised working uniform in the vessels.

In 2014, the Navy working uniform pattern for all officials have been changed in favour of adopting the authorised digital camouflage pattern uniform which incorporates sparse black and medium grey shapes on a light grey background.

The Navy Special Service Group follows the Army Special Service Group&#x27;s authorised uniform and wears the U.S. Woodland (M81) uniform while the Pakistan Marines have their own woodland pattern featuring light brown, olive green and blue shapes on a tan or light olive background.

==Bases and facilities==

From 1947 to 1991, the entire naval infrastructure and bases of the Pakistan Navy were primarily based in Karachi with the exception of the Navy NHQ in Islamabad. In the 1950s, it was the crucial help from the United States Navy that the Karachi Naval Dockyard was built and constructed for wartime operations. Besides the Naval Base Karachi, the PNS Dhaka in East Pakistan was the only naval base for the Pakistan Navy, dedicated for coastal operations only

After the Indian Navy&#x27;s missile attacks in Karachi in 1971, the Navy concentrated on building and moving its operational assets in Balochistan, Punjab, and the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

These naval bases are operationalised for various purposes including the logistics and maintenance support, armoury and ammunition support, air stations, military hospitals, SEALs teams, coastal and missile defences, missile boats and submarine bases, forward operating bases etc. The PNS Zafar serves as the major logistics naval base for the Pakistani military&#x27;s operational capability in the western and northern Pakistan, followed by the naval forward operating base constructed at the vicinity of the Naval War College in Lahore.

The primary naval air station is PNS Mehran, followed by the establishment of the naval air stations in Makran, Ormara, Turbat and the Manora Island. In 2017, PNS Siddiq was commissioned to support the aerial missions for the Pakistan Naval Aviation reconnaissance group to guard the safety of the CPEC.

The PNS Hameed, commissioned in 2017, is a VLF facility near the Karachi coast, while the Karachi-based PNS Iqbal and the PNS Qasim serves for the operational activities dedicated for the Navy Special Service Group and the Marines. The Jinnah Naval Base and proposed Kalmat Naval Base are dedicated towards maintaining and harbouring the country&#x27;s strategic assets such as the nuclear-capable submarines.

Besides deployment within Pakistan, the Pakistan Navy, along with the inter-services branches, are permanently based in different parts in the Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

==Medical care==
The Navy operates five hospitals:
* PNS Shifa Hospital, Karachi (600 beds)
* PNS Hafeez Hospital, Islamabad (197 beds)
* PNS Rahat Hospital, Karachi (200 beds)
* PNS Darmaan Jah Hospital, Ormara (100 beds)
* Naval Hospital, Turbat (25 beds)
* Naval Hospital, Gwadar (100 beds) is in planning

==Personnel==

===Commissioned officers===

From its commencement in August 1947, the Pakistan Navy had traditionally followed the ranks and insignia of the Royal Navy but disbanded in favour of adopting the officer ranks system of the United States Navy as early as the 1950s.

Unlike the army or air force where there are several paths to become the officers, there is only one way of becoming the naval officer by must attending the Pakistan Naval Academy—after passing out the boot camp in Manora Island— for one-and-half year for them to be able to passed out from the academy.

The passed out cadets gain commission in the Navy as midshipman, taking their first assignment in an open-sea ship that gives them the experience of life at sea while being trained in different careers on board. The training of the passed out midshipman usually lasts till six months before rotating back to the naval academy to be promoted as the Sub-lieutenants. Their college education is provided at the Pakistan Navy Engineering College in Karachi for three years, pursuing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in their choice of career.
The Pakistan Navy has the same officer rank hierarchy as the Royal Navy; insignia are similar to the Royal Navy except that commodore&#x27;s and admiral&#x27;s shoulder boards have a star and crescent instead of a crown.

Besides the military officers, the Department of Navy also offers employments to civilians in financial management, accountancy, medical services, computing, and administration, and has currently employed ≈2,000 civilians that met the Navy&#x27;s quota in 2018.

===Enlisted personnel===

The recruitment and the enlistment in the navy is nationwide and the recruitment in the Navy is carried out by the release of the employment tender in the print newspapers and televised commercials twice a year– first group attending the boot camp in May and the second being directed on November. The Directorate of Recruitment that is located in the Navy NHQ in Islamabad controls the recruiting offices and centers in all over the country— the recruiting offices are located in Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan. Before 1966, almost all the enlisted personnel and officers had to be sent to attend the military academies in the United Kingdom to be educated and to be trained in technical branches for the Pakistan Navy.

After passing out from the nine-month long boot camp, the enlisted personnel are directed for subsequent job training at the PNS Karsaz in Karachi on the matters of technical subjects and assigned for different branches in the Navy.

Promotion in the Navy from the enlistment to officers ranks are much quicker than the army or the air force, as the Department of Navy offers financial aid to those enlisted personnel successful in their profession to attend the colleges and universities. Most of the enlisted personnel rarely stays in their enlisted ranks at the time of their retirement as most retires at junior officer ranks once reaching their retirement age of 62

Their technical experiences in their fields is consolidated into the professional training that forms their basis to attend the respective university for them to earn the four-year college degree.

The noncommissioned officers (or enlists) wear respective anchors color patches or badges chevrons on their shoulders. Retirement age for the enlisted personnel varies and depends on the enlisted ranks that they have attained during their services.

===Recruitment and training===

After the Navy was established in August 1947, the Navy had to send its officers and enlisted personnel to be trained at the Britannia Royal Naval College in the United Kingdom whose training and education by the British Royal Navy was crucial at all levels of cadet&#x27;s learning and schooling. During its earliest time in 1947, the Department of Navy had only 3,800 personnel (200 officers, 3,000 Enlists, and 500 civilian employees) as the Navy faced the same problems as its Department of Army as the most technical enlisted personnel and skilled executive officers were Punjabi Muslims while others had Urdu-speaking background (i.e. Indian immigrants as naturalised citizens of Pakistan).

After 1971, the Bhutto administration introduced the quota system to give fair chance to the residents of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to enlist in the military. In 2012, Sanhia Karim became the first Balochi woman to be commissioned into the navy, she joined in a squad consisting of fifty-three female officers and seventy-two enlists from Balochistan, Pakistan. In 2012, the Navy pushed its personnel strength to Balochistan after sending a large formation of Baloch university students to Navy Engineering Colleges and War College as well as staff schools to complete their officer training requirements. The Navy established three additional facilities in Balochistan to supervise the training to its personnel.

Recruitment in the Navy remains to be challenge for the naval recruiters to enlists citizens and their selfless commitment to the military from the urbanised metropolitan cities where the preference of college education (especially attending post-graduate schooling in the United States and the English-speaking countries) is much higher and strongly desirable. Furthermore, the medical standards and education levels required by the Department of Navy to be able to perform technical jobs also poses significant challenges as the Navy requiring the significant percentage marks once the matriculation examinations are concluded.

The Navy has only one boot camp, the PNS &quot;Himalaya&quot; in Manora Island, where the basic military training takes place. The basic military training at the PNS Himalaya goes for nine-months where instructions on military life is given while the physical conditioning is strongly emphasised. The officer cadets are sent to attend the Pakistan Naval Academy where their training lasts for two years before they are able to pass out from the Naval Academy. Once passing out, the commissioned junior officers must spend six-month deployment in Arabian Sea before being selected to attend the professional schools, such as the Naval Engineering College in Karachi, to move towards attaining the bachelor&#x27;s degree in a period of four-years.

As the estimates made in 2003 and 2009, the Navy had approximately ≈30,200 active duty personnel. In 2014, the estimates established the Navy&#x27;s manpower strength at 30,700 active duty personnel. but its combined manpower strength is increased and approximated at ≈40,500 personnel based on recent estimates in 2018.

==Education and training==
===Schooling, teaching, and institutions===
The Pakistan Navy offers the wide range of lucrative careers to the high school graduates in the technical fields by issuing specialised diplomas and certifications at the PNS Karsaz and the PNS Bahadur, which consists of the schools of operations, underwater, surface weapons, communications, and the naval police. Instructions and technical education on technical fields and the engineering are primarily taught at the Pakistan Navy Engineering College that is open for both military and public admission, and offers college degree programs at undergraduate and post-graduate level.

When the Navy was established in 1947, there was no technical schools for the Navy to look after the ship maintenance and power machinery that led to the establishment of the Pakistan Naval Polytechnic Institute (PNPI) in 1951 and the Navy Engineering College in 1962 whose admissions are open to public besides the military personnel. From 1947 to 1967, the Navy had to rely on the education and training provided by the Royal Navy at all levels of schooling, and had to send most of its officers and enlisted men to be trained at the Britannia Royal Naval College at the Dartmouth and the Royal Naval College in Greenwich who were mostly trained in communication and navigation. Training on the operations of warships and education on the military staffing was crucial for the Pakistan Navy in the 1960s under the United States-sponsored International Military Education and Training (IMET) arranged for Pakistan under the Security Assistance Program (SAP) as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s officers served in the faculty of the engineering and technical schools of the Navy.

In 1966, the Pakistan Naval Academy was established under the guidance of the United States Navy, and is a premier institution of higher learning whose alumni included the Commanders of the Royal Qatari Navy, Royal Saudi Navy, and the Sri Lanka Navy while other nations naval cadets have also attended the naval academy.

In 1968, the Pakistan Naval War College was established in Lahore, whose curriculum is very similar to the Naval War College in the United States, is a primary military staff college which offers critical thinking techniques and developing ideas for naval warfare to the officers in the army and the air force. In 1970, the School of Logistics and Management was established that conducts research on military logistics and management in imparting naval warfare techniques to the military officers serving in the army, air force, and marines departments of the Pakistani military.

After the 1971 war with India, the Navy established several schools on strategy, naval warfare, and weapons tactics by commissioning the PNS Bahadur in 1981 as the navy established schools are listed below:

Established in 1971, the National Defense University (NDU) in Islamabad is the most senior and premier institute of higher learning that provides the advance critical thinking level and research-based strategy level education to the senior military officers in the Pakistani military. The NDU is a significant institution of higher learning in understanding the institutional norms of military tutelage in Pakistan because it constitutes the &quot;highest learning platform where the military leadership comes together for common instruction&quot;, according to thesis written by Pakistani author Aqil Shah. Without securing their graduation from their master&#x27;s program at the NDU, no officer in the Pakistani military can be promoted as general in the army or air force, or admiral in the navy or marines as it is a prerequisite for their promotion to become a senior member at the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.

Additionally, the platform provided at the NDU represents a radical shift from the emphasis on operational and staff functions and the level of ranks are imposed as qualification to attend the master&#x27;s program at the NDU, usually brigadiers, air commodores, and commodores, are invited to given admission in broad range of strategic, political, social, and economic factors as these factors affect the country&#x27;s national security. In this sense, the NDU becomes the critical thinking institution as its constitutes active-duty senior military officers corps&#x27; baptism into a shared ideological framework about the military&#x27;s appropriate role, status, and behavior in relation to state and society, and shared values affect how these officers perceive and respond to civilian governmental decisions, policies, and political crises. Admission to the NDU is not restricted to military officials, but civilians can also attend and graduate, allowing them to explore the broader aspects of national security. 

Established in 1991, the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) has now absorbed and amalgamated the existing naval engineering college, and is a counterpart institution in science and technology to that of the NDU in Islamabad. Besides the strategic and military education, the Navy leads some marine scientific programs via the Naval Observatory while it leads the research on hydrography by conducting the hydrographic survey through the PNS Behr Paima, and provides support to the oceanographic program led by the civilian National Institute of Oceanography (NIO).

==Naval jack==


From 1947 to 1956, the Pakistan Navy had stuck with the Ensign of the Royal Indian Navy that featured the British Queen&#x27;s colors and the white flag. The Navy continued the tradition that it inherited from the Royal Indian Navy and British culture that was common with the Royal Navy until the American military advisers was attached the guide the Navy on military arts and science under the Military Advisory Assistance Group by the Eisenhower administration in 1956.

Since then, the Navy&#x27;s tradition and culture is commonly and uniquenly influenced from the United States Navy.

After the promulgation of the Constitution in 1956, the Navy gained its independence from the British Royal patronage and became the federal institution of the armed forces commissioned by the elected President of Pakistan. The prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was permanently removed from the Navy as well as disbanding the British monarch culture and tradition in the Navy.

The naval jack and the ensign flag of the Navy immediately replaced the Queen&#x27;s colours and the white ensign entirely, instead the dark blue color with the anchor crest of the Navy was adopted while the blue anchor was added in the side of the corner white colored section on the national flag of Pakistan. Since then, the naval jack has always flown in the warships of the Pakistan Navy while the naval ensign of the Navy is commonly used by the Pakistan Marines as their primary war flag.

==Civil society and business activities==


The Pakistan Navy has played an integral part in the civil society of Pakistan, almost since its inception. In 1996, General Jehangir Karamat described Pakistan armed forces&#x27; relations with the society:

In times of national calamities and emergencies, the Pakistan Navy has been deployed in relief operations and nation building programs in the country. In 2004, a tactical task force under then-Commodore Asif Sandila coordinated the peacetime relief operations in Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Bangladesh when the underwater earthquake caused a tsunami and struck the South Asian nations. In 2005, the Navy deployed the PNS &quot;Badr (D-184)&quot; to help assists the relief efforts for the earthquake that struck the northern part of the country in October 2005.

In 2010, the Navy coordinated one of its largest relief operations during the nationwide flash floods, with Navy divers rescuing and evacuating more than 352,291 people in August 2010. In addition, the Navy and Marines personnel provided 43,850 kg of food and relief goods to flood victims; 5,700 kg of ready-to-cook food, 1,000 kg of dates and 5,000 kg of food has been dispatched to Sukkur., under the program &quot;PN Model Village&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s civil engineering corps built the model houses in the affected areas for the internally displaced person (IDPs).

On 10 June 2018, Pakistan Navy and Maritime Security Agency rescued eleven Iranian crew members on a sunken Iranian boat in the Northern Arabian Sea, about away from Karachi.

===Corporate and business activities===
The Pakistan Navy has the wider commercial and financial interests in the country, and is a forerunner of the Bahria Foundation (lit. Naval Foundation). From 1996 to 2000, the Navy was a major sponsor of the Bahria Town– the real estate enterprise – and reportedly received market shares for the use of its name in commercial building projects. In 2002, the Navy filed a civil lawsuit to refrain the Bahria Town using its name for profiteering – the lawsuit was eventually settled in civil court in favour of Navy in 2018.

For external billets appointment, the federal government takes the senior leadership of the Navy as secondment to manage the federal institutions such as the Karachi Port Trust, Port of Karachi and the Port of Gwadar.

==Awards and honours==
===Nishan-e-Haider===

In military awards hierarchy, the Nishan-e-Haider (lit. &quot;Order of Lion&quot;; Urdu: نشان حیدر; abbreviated as NH) is the highest and the most prestigious honour awarded posthumously for bravery and actions of valor in event of war. Established in March 1956 by the Constitution, this award is an equivalent to the American Medal of Honor, British Victoria Cross (VC), Russian Order of St. Andrew, or the French Legion of Honour. Unlike the American Medal of Honor, the &quot;Nishan-e-Haider&quot; (NH) has only been conferred to those who have been &quot;martyred&quot; and proved their distinguished valor of actions in an event of conflict or war.

Since the commencement of the Navy on 15 August 1947, no naval officer has been honoured or bestowed with the medal. After the PNS Mehran attack on 22 May 2011, a recommendation was sent by the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the President of Pakistan to posthumously honour Lt. Syed Yasir Abbas for his heroic actions during the attack but nothing came of it.

<doc id="1183799" wikidata="Q837964" url="?curid=1183799" title="Vulcan, Hunedoara">
<text>Vulcan (; formerly &quot;Jiu-Vaidei-Vulcan&quot;; , &quot;Zsilyvajdejvulkán&quot; (&quot;Zsily-Vajdej-Vulkán&quot;); ) is a city in Hunedoara County, Transylvania, Romania. With a population of 19,772 as of 2021, it is the second-largest city in the Jiu Valley. It administers two villages, Dealul Babii (&quot;Old Woman&#x27;s Hill&quot; in Romanian; &quot;Hegyvulkán&quot;) and Jiu-Paroșeni (&quot;Zsilymacesdparoseny&quot;).

==Name==
The city is named after the Vulcan Pass that connects the Jiu Valley to Oltenia, itself being derived from Slavic &quot;vlk&quot;, meaning &quot;wolf&quot; (even if &quot;vulcan&quot; means &quot;volcano&quot; in Romanian).

==Geography==
Vulcan is located at the southern extremity of Hunedoara County, about from the county seat, Deva, on the border with Gorj County. It is situated in a hilly area north of the Vâlcan Mountains, on the banks of the Jiul de Vest and its tributaries, the rivers Merișoara and Crevedia.

The city is crossed by national road , which connects it to nearby Aninoasa and to Petroșani, to the northeast, and to Lupeni, to the west. County road DJ664 leads to the Vulcan Pass, to the south, and on to Schela, Gorj, while county road DJ666 leads north to Dealul Babii village and Bănița commune.

The Vulcan train station serves the CFR Line 214, a railway from Livezeni (in Petroșani) to Lupeni.

==History==
The coal resources of the region were discovered in 1788 while the Austrian General Landau defended Vulcan from the Ottoman Turks. One night the soldiers could not put out the camp fire they made, as the piles of coal underneath had caught fire. General Landau thought that he could stop the Turks without a fight by setting piles of coal on fire. The Turks noted the large numbers of fires on the heights and thought that the Austrian army was much larger than theirs and retreated.

In 1850, the first mine was set up by the Hoffman brothers of Brașov.

== Demographics ==

At the 2021 census, Vulcan had a population of 19,772. This marked a decrease of 18.2% from the 2011 census, when the city had 24,160 inhabitants; of those, 92.91% were Romanians, 5.13% 
Hungarians, 1.41% Romani, and 0.2% Germans.

== People ==

* Ernő Csíki (1875–1954), Hungarian entomologist
* Andrej Prean Nagy (1923–1997), Hungarian footballer
* Ștefan Onisie (1925–1984), footballer and manager

<text>HM Prison Beechworth, now known as Beechworth Gaol, was a medium security Australian prison located in Beechworth, Victoria, Australia.

Construction of the current structure was begun in 1859 and completed in 1864 at a cost of £47,000. The prison closed in 2004 and the site has been purchased by private developers. A replacement facility, the Beechworth Correctional Centre, was opened in January 2005.

==History==
HM Prison Beechworth was built on the site of Beechworth&#x27;s first stockade. It was designed by Victoria&#x27;s Public Works Department and constructed using local granite that was quaried with prison labour. Beechworth was one of nine panopticon prisons built in Victoria.

Construction began in 1857 and the prison opened in 1860, though was incomplete and only had single cells for 36 prisoners. The capacity doubled when the building was completed in 1864. Beechworth initially housed male and female prisoners. Female prisoners were assigned washing and needlework for government departments. Between 1865 and 1881, eight executions were carried out at the prison. Ned Kelly served six months at the prison in 1870-71 for assault. He was again held there during his committal trial for murder in 1880. Kelly&#x27;s mother, Ellen and two associates of the Kelly family also served sentences at the prison the late 1870s for the attempted murder of Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick. Twenty suspected sympathisers of Kelly were held in 1879 in an attempt to limit support to the Kelly gang. The prison&#x27;s iron gates were installed due to fears they may be attempts to break the sympathisers out of the prison.

Between 1918 and 1925 the prison closed due to a lack of prisoners. It reopened as a reformatory for male recidivists between 1925 and 1951. In 1951 it became a training prison, focusing on rehabilitation and education. Beechworth Prison closed 2004.

<text>Hermann is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the western Oceanus Procellarum, just over one crater diameter to the south of the Moon&#x27;s equator. It is a solitary crater with only a few tiny craterlets and some low wrinkle ridges nearby.

The interior floor of this crater has been flooded with lava, leaving a dark surface with the same albedo as the surrounding lunar mare. Only a low, nearly circular rim projects above the surface, which is not significantly eroded. The rim has a slight outward bulge on the western rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hermann.

<text>Whittington is a village and civil parish which lies approximately 3 miles south east of Lichfield, in the Lichfield district of Staffordshire, England. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 2,591, increasing to 2,603 at the 2011 Census. The parish council is a joint one with Fisherwick. The Coventry Canal borders the village to the north and east.

==History==
The place name of Whittington derives from the Old English for an estate associated with a man called Hwīta. Hwīta was an Anglo-Saxon personal name meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, given to someone with fair hair or pale complexion.

Whittington formed part of the Bishop of Lichfield&#x27;s great manorial estate, which covered much of south-east Staffordshire. Known as the Manor of Longdon, it had been created for the bishop of Lichfield from the time of the Saxons, they remained the lord of the manor until 1546 when the bishop was forced to surrender it to Sir William Paget, one of Henry VIII&#x27;s principal Secretaries of State, who was given vast tracts of land in Staffordshire as a reward for his service. 

Whittington Old Hall is an ancient medieval manor house, it is not known exactly when the original Hall was built, but it is highly likely that the early Tudor builders retained the old foundations of the medieval great hall with screen porch and cellars and erected a half-timbered mansion. In the Elizabethan era, the whole of the south front with a portion of the entrance front were entirely re-clad with brick and stonework, complete with striking bays and stone mullioned windows. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The mesne-lords in the 16th century were the Clerkson family, whose female heir married into the Everard family. By the 17th century the Babington family owned large tracts of land in the area and built a grand mansion at nearby Packington Hall which passed by marriage to the Levett family. The Dyott family who were major land owners in the village in the 18th and 19th centuries, lived at nearby Freeford Hall. 

In 1741, Sarah Neal left her house and croft in Whittington to start a school for poor children of the village. Funds were augmented when the Reverend Richard Levett died in 1802, leaving a legacy and in 1864, a handsome gothic building for a girls&#x27; and infants&#x27; school was built by Lieut.-Col. Richard Dyott. Village children continued to be educated here until 1968 when a new school was built in Common Lane.

During the 18th century Whittington Heath was the site of the Lichfield Races, one of the largest and well attended horse racing meetings in the Midlands. A grandstand was erected in 1773 near the Lichfield-Tamworth Road, however, by the 19th century the popularity of the races dwindled, and military use of the heath grew.

Under the Cardwell Reforms of the army, the War Office approached the Marquess of Anglesey in 1875 to buy the heath for the building of Whittington Barracks. Construction of the barracks for the depots of the two regiments and for a militia battalion (of which there were four in the county) started on Whittington Heath in 1877. 1881 was the date recorded as the formal handing over of the newly built barracks to the military.
The Lichfield Races are remembered in the names of pubs called the Horse &amp; Jockey and in Lichfield, The Scales which was where jockeys were &quot;weighed in&quot;. The old grandstand became a soldiers home before it was purchased in 1957 by Whittington Heath Golf Course as its clubhouse.

In the late 1970s the vicar of Whittington, Reverend Paul Brothwell became concerned about the quality of care available in local hospitals to patients with terminal illnesses. St Giles Hospice was established in 1983 on the site of the old Vicarage, it has since grown to become a major institution for palliative care in the Midlands.

==Religious sites==

The church of St Giles was built in the 13th century using sandstone quarried from Hopwas Hayes wood. It was destroyed by fire in 1760, and was rebuilt largely in brick in the Georgian style. The church contains memorial panelling for Samuel Lipscomb Seckham (1827–1900), architect and High Sheriff of Staffordshire, who carried out a major restoration of Whittington Old Hall, in the late 19th century.

The Levett family produced three vicars of Whittington, this was due to the fact that Theophilus Levett purchased the advowson of Whittington church from John Cooper of Aldridge in 1735. The &#x27;right of advowson&#x27; was the archaic right to nominate the position of parish priest. Rev. Richard Levett served as vicar from 1743 to 1751. His son, also Rev. Richard Levett, served as vicar of Whittington from 1795 to 1796 and Rev. Thomas Levett served for forty years, from 1796 to 1836. There are memorials to the Levetts in St Giles Church. Large landowners, the family also established charitable gifts towards the Whittington Free School. A subsequent rector of Whittington was Hon. Rev. George Barrington Legge, son of William Legge, 4th Earl of Dartmouth, who was married to the daughter of John Levett of Wychnor Park.

The co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer plc, Thomas Spencer, is buried at St Giles Church, Whittington. The churchyard also contains Commonwealth war graves of 47 service personnel of the First and Second World Wars.

<doc id="1183822" wikidata="Q5234229" url="?curid=1183822" title="David Goodhart">
<text>David Goodhart (born 12 September 1956) is a British journalist, commentator and author. He is the founder and a former editor of &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Goodhart is one of seven children born to Valerie Forbes Winant (the niece of John Gilbert Winant) and Conservative MP Sir Philip Goodhart. He is a great-great-grandson of Mayer Lehman, co-founder of Lehman Brothers. He was educated at Eton College, and the University of York, where he gained a degree in history and politics. He has written of being an &quot;old Etonian Marxist&quot; in his late teens and early 20s.

==Career==
Goodhart was a correspondent for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; for 12 years; for part of the period he was stationed in Germany. He founded &quot;Prospect&quot;, a British current affairs magazine in 1995 and was the editor until 2010, when he became editor-at-large. In December 2011, he was appointed Director of the London-based think tank Demos. As of 2017 he is Head of the Demography, Immigration and Integration Unit at the think tank Policy Exchange.

He has written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. He has presented documentaries for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Analysis&quot; programme on immigration (in 2010) and on Blue Labour. He has written of the influence on his thinking of people like Maurice Glasman, who coined the term Blue Labour.

He was one of four new Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) board commissioners appointed in November 2020.

==Political views==
Goodhart first wrote that &quot;sharing and solidarity can conflict with diversity&quot;, in an essay &quot;Too diverse?&quot; published by &quot;Prospect&quot; in February 2004. Trevor Phillips, then chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, described such arguments as being those of &quot;liberal Powellites&quot;, after the Conservative politician Enoch Powell.

In the book &quot;The British Dream: Successes and Failures of Post-war Immigration&quot; (2013), Goodhart argues that high immigration can undermine national solidarity and be a threat to social democratic ideals about a welfare state. He advocates that immigration to the United Kingdom should be reduced and more emphasis put on integrating immigrants.

&quot;The Road to Somewhere&quot; was published in 2017. A fault line in Britain existed, he suggested, between &quot;Somewheres&quot;, those people firmly connected to a specific community which consists of about half the population, &quot;Inbetweeners&quot;, and &quot;Anywheres&quot;, those usually living in cities, who are socially liberal and well educated, the latter being only a minority of about 20% to 25% of the total population, but who in fact had &quot;over-ruled&quot; the attitudes of the majority. Jonathan Freedland in &quot;The Guardian&quot; believed it could be argued New Labour had actually often had the Somewheres in mind in policies espousing an &quot;Asbo culture&quot; and the &quot;prison works&quot; attitude which they continued from Michael Howard&#x27;s earlier period as Home Secretary.

Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2018, Goodhart described the Windrush scandal as &quot;an error of over-zealous control&quot; which &quot;must not lead to a radical watering-down of the so-called &#x27;hostile environment&#x27;&quot;.

==Personal life==
David Goodhart was married to &quot;Financial Times&quot; journalist Lucy Kellaway; they have four children. The couple separated in 2015.

<doc id="1183823" wikidata="Q2335420" url="?curid=1183823" title="Dodge Power Wagon">
<text>The Dodge Power Wagon is a four-wheel drive medium duty truck that was produced in various model series from 1945 to 1980 by Dodge. The Power Wagon name was revived for the 2005 model year as a four-wheel drive version of the Dodge Ram 2500. As a nameplate, &quot;Power Wagon&quot; continues as a special package of the four-wheel drive version of 3/4 ton Ram Trucks 2500 model.

The original civilian version, commonly called the &quot;flat fender&quot; Power Wagon (FFPW) or &quot;Military Type&quot;, was mechanically based on Dodge&#x27;s 3/4-ton WC series of World War II military trucks. The Power Wagon was the first 4x4 medium duty truck produced by a major manufacturer in a civilian version. It represents a significant predecessor to the many modern four-wheel drive trucks in use today. It was marketed as the WDX truck. Until about 1960 it was internally known by its engineering code T137 – a name still used for the original series by enthusiasts. Following Chrysler Corporation policy of badge engineering to provide a greater number of sales outlets overseas, Power Wagons were also marketed around the world under the Fargo and De Soto badges.

Starting in the 1957 model year, factory four-wheel-drive versions of the Dodge C Series trucks were produced and sold as the W-100, W-200, W-300, and W-500, alongside the older Power Wagon. The pickups had the &quot;Power Wagon&quot; badge on the fender. The older design Power Wagon was marketed as the &quot;Military Type&quot; to distinguish it from the styled pickup versions. Later the &quot;Military Type&quot; was given the series number W-300M, and ultimately WM-300.

The heavy-duty four-wheel-drive W-300 and W-500 trucks were marketed as &quot;Power Giants&quot;. The four-wheel-drive version of the Dodge Town Wagon also got the &quot;Power Wagon&quot; badge.
The &quot;Military Type&quot; sales in the United States ended by 1968, because the vehicle did not comply with new federal light-duty truck regulations. The &quot;Power Wagon&quot; options continued on the Dodge D-Series through the 1980 model year. For the 1981 model year, &quot;Power Ram&quot; became the marketing name for four-wheel-drive Ram pickups, and aside from a 1999 concept vehicle, the &quot;Power Wagon&quot; name was not used until the 2004 revival.

==Civilian 1-ton Power Wagon &quot;Military-Type&quot;, Flat Fender Style&quot; (1945-1978)==

The Military style Power Wagon had three series during its lifetime, with different model numbers. The nominal one-ton rated Power Wagon&#x27;s gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) was 8,700 pounds. Its maximum payload was 3,000 pounds. It was produced starting in the 1946 model year, and U.S. sales ended in 1968. Export sales continued through 1978.

The civilian Power Wagon continued the lineage of limited production Dodge 4WD trucks from the 1930s, that proved basic four-wheel drive design concepts, primarily for the military. Mechanically derived from Dodge&#x27;s 1942–1945 3/4-ton WC series military trucks, the Power Wagon was introduced in 1946 as the first civilian production 4x4 truck. During its development phase, it was initially named the WDX General Purpose Truck, a name still used on some of the preliminary materials handed out by Dodge, before sales began in March 1946. The &#x27;W&#x27; was a continuation of the 1941–1947 model year series, followed by a &#x27;D&#x27; instead of a &#x27;C&#x27;, because the civilian truck was a 1-ton rating instead of the Army&#x27;s -ton, and the &#x27;X&#x27; was added to indicate four-wheel drive, as opposed to all previous civilian two-wheel driven models. Some believe the truck was renamed &quot;Power Wagon&quot; after a contemporaneous trucking magazine with that title.

Meant to compete with military-based Ford/Marmon-Herrington and GMC trucks, it had an enclosed all-weather civilian cab and a purpose-designed 8-foot cargo box. It had a 126-inch (3,200 mm) up to a 147&quot; wheelbase chassis and featured the 230 cubic-inch flathead inline-six engine, a 4-speed manual transmission, a two-speed 1.96-1 ratio low range transfer case for part time 4-wheel drive with a power take off (PTO) which would send power front or rear for operating auxiliary equipment, and 9.00/16-8 ply tires on 16×6.50 inch 5-stud split ring steel rims. In 1961 the 230 was replaced with the 251 cubic-inch flat head six.

===First Series: late 1945-50 ===

Includes the following years and model numbers: 1945-47 WDX; 1948-9 B-1-PW; 1950 B-2-PW; 
Additional Distinguishing Features: (4) rectangular stake pockets on each side of the bed; round speedometer with a rectangular gauge cluster on each side. The two rectangular gauge housings have the instrument lettering on the glass instead of the face of the gauge.

==Four Wheel Drive light-duty pickup trucks and Town Wagons W100 and W200 (1957 - 1980)==

The first light-duty styled Power Wagons came out in 1957 with the introduction of the four-wheel-drive versions of the Dodge C Series pickups and Town Wagons, Beginning in 1957, -ton two-and four-wheel-drive models were designated D100 and W100s, and -tons as D200 and W200, respectively. These trucks featured the same cabs, bodywork, and cargo boxes used on the conventional models. Their 4WD mechanical components—axles, transfer cases, and transmissions—were sourced from outside manufacturers. Chrysler Corporation owned the New Process Gear Company (competitors generally used Spicer (Dana) transfer cases and Borg-Warner or in-house transmissions).

In 1963, a new 225 cubic-inch Chrysler slant six replaced the 251 cubic-inch six used in 1961 &amp; 1962 W100 &amp; W200 Power Wagon Trucks. The Power Wagon W300 continued to use the 251 cubic-inch L-6 engine. The new 225 cubic-inch engine (the 225–2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to improvements including roller timing chains, bi-metal connecting rod bearings, stellite-faced exhaust valves, roto caps on exhaust valves, and polyacrylic valve stem seals.

A big-block Chrysler 383 V8 engine became an option starting in 1967. From 1961 to 1971 the body was called the &quot;Sweptline,&quot; then transitioned to a more modern body image from 1972 through 1980 with varied grilles and paint schemes. The Town Wagon Power Wagon retained the C Series body style until it was discontinued in 1966. In 1975 the 4-wheel drive became full-time with a 2-speed transfer case; this was changed back to part-time 4-wheel drive in 1980 due to the energy crisis. A huge boost in sales followed the 1974 release of the extended &quot;Club Cab,&quot; popular with families and camper hauling. The 4-door crew cab was far less common and is quite desirable to collectors for restoration. Utility and function were unmatched by few competing models, as the towing, payload, and snow plowing capacity of the Power Wagon equipped with &quot;Dana 60&quot; 8-lug axles was very popular with municipal and regional road crews.

==Four Wheel Drive medium-duty trucks W300, W500, and W600 (1957-1980)==
A one-ton W300 light-duty/civilian type Power Wagon was released in 1958. This also had the styled cab and sheet metal as the D300 Medium duty one-ton trucks.

The two-ton W500 Power Wagon (only a chassis cab was built) was introduced in 1956 as the C3-HW and lasted through the 1971 model year. This was replaced in 1972 with the W600 (also cab and chassis only), which was produced until 1977 when all Dodge medium-duty models were discontinued. To compensate for the loss of the medium-duty W600 a new W400 chassis cab was introduced in 1977.

==Dodge Ram Power Ram (1981-1993)==
The Power Wagon nameplate was discontinued in 1981 with the introduction of the Dodge Ram, with the four-wheel-drive models being sold under the &quot;Power Ram&quot; nameplate through 1993. 1989 to 1993 models saw the addition of an optional 6-cylinder Cummins turbo-diesel engine.

==Dodge Ram 2500 Power Wagon 2005–2009 (DH)==
For 2005, Dodge resurrected the Power Wagon name on a version of the Dodge Ram 2500. It was a special off-road version of the Ram 2500 with a 5.7L &quot;Hemi&quot; V8 as the only engine option. Interior configurations remain similar to standard models. From 2005 to 2009, the Power Wagon offered a choice between a regular cab with an bed or a Quad Cab (extended cab) with a bed on a wheelbase.

Special features of the Power Wagon include:

*Electronically controlled locking differentials (front and rear)
*Electronically disconnecting front sway bar
*Integrated 12,000 lb electric Warn winch
*17-inch diameter Alcoa forged wheels
*Large 33-inch (285/70R17) diameter BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A tires. 
*Bilstein Monotube Gas Charged Shocks
* Extensive skidplates: front stabilizer bar, transfer case, fuel tank, special skid plate cross members welded to the frame with open bars bolted to them across the midsection.
* 1.4&quot; factory lift in front, 1.0&quot; in the rear (0.4&quot; front and rear due to larger tires). Softer rate springs.
* Strengthened torque converter
* 4.56:1 axle ratio
*Revised clutch fan
* Strengthened steering gear
* Low range 4x4 throttle mapping changed.

Upgraded suspension and larger tires naturally give the truck a taller ride height. Clearance lights and tow hooks are standard equipment. Fender flares are standard equipment as well. The fender flares assist with tire coverage due to the Power Wagon&#x27;s wider tires.

===Powertrain===
*5.7L Hemi V8 (345 hp / 375 lb ft of torque) for 2005 - 2009 model years

====Transmission====
The 6-speed manual G56 transmission was standard, with the 5-speed 545RFE automatic transmission optional.

====Transfer case====
The transfer case was a New Venture 271 and had a 2.72:1 low range gear ratio. A transfer case skid plate was and is standard equipment. A floor-mounted manual shift-on-the-fly transfer case is the only choice available.

====Axles====
The axles are manufactured by American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. The front is an AAM 9.25 and the rear is a hybrid AAM 10.5 with the larger axle shafts from the AAM 11.5. Despite the fact the axles have locking differentials, the rear axle is also a helical-type limited-slip differential when unlocked. The Power Wagon is equipped with a 4.56:1 axle gear ratio not available on other 2500 models.

==Ram Trucks 2500 Power Wagon 2010-present (DJ)==
In 2010 the Dodge trucks were re-branded as Ram, and the Heavy Duty lineup received a major redesign. The Power Wagon model continued with its special features for off-road prowess. Beginning in 2010, the Power Wagon is only available as a crew cab with a bed on a wheelbase. The Power Wagon features off-road-tuned suspension, electronically locking differentials, an electronic sway bar disconnects, and a 12,000 lb winch. Due to the softer suspension, the Power Wagon models receive a reduced GVWR, and consequentially a lower payload and towing capacity, as compared to a standard 2500. 
===Powertrain===

*5.7 L Hemi V8 (383 hp / 400 lb ft of torque) for 2010 - 2013 model years
*6.4 L Hemi V8 (410 hp / 429 lb ft of torque) for 2014 to current model year

====Transmission====
Beginning in 2010, the Power Wagon is only available with automatic transmissions.
====Transfer Case====
A floor-mounted, manual-shift transfer case was the only option on the Power Wagon, until the 2021 model year when the electronic-shift transfer case was made available as an option. For 2025, electronic-shift is standard and manual-shift is no longer available.

For 2019 the front driveshaft switched to a CV joint connection at the transfer case.
====Axles====
Power Wagon models use AAM&#x27;s &quot;TracRite&quot; locking differentials. The EL model for the front and GTL model in the rear, the differentials are electronically lockable on-demand using controls located on the dashboard, and the rear is limited-slip under normal conditions.

2010 Power Wagon models (along with other Ram trucks) received larger universal joints but retained the AAM 9.25 front and AAM 10.5 rear axle with a 4.56:1 final drive.

For the 2014 model year, with the introduction of the more powerful 6.4L engine, the axle ratio was reduced to 4.10:1. The larger AAM 11.5 rear axle is also introduced for the 2014 model year.

In the 2019 model year changes, the Power Wagon retained the AAM 9.25 front axle, AAM 11.5 rear axle, and 4.10:1 gear ratio; however rear axle internals were changed including different axle shafts, differential carrier, and larger 32-spline pinion.

===2014 Update===
The 2014 Ram Power Wagon underwent extensive changes. Starting with 2014 models, the Power Wagon comes standard with the new, larger 6.4L &quot;Hemi&quot; V8. The transmission and transfer case remain unchanged, but the axle ratio changes from 4.56:1 gear ratio to 4:10 gear ratios. The rear axle is exchanged for the larger 11.5 AAM axle.

For 2014 the entire Ram 2500 lineup rear suspension is changed from traditional leaf springs to 5-link coil spring arrangement, and the front suspension has been changed to a radius arm arrangement (3-link) instead of the 5-link previously used. The Power Wagon is equipped with approximately 2&quot; lift over the standard Ram 2500 and is equipped with softer rate springs for off-road performance. Unique to the Power Wagon 3-link front suspension is the &quot;Articulink&quot; front radius arms, which add an extra link and rubber bushing, enabling additional axle articulation. The Power Wagon continues to use Bilstein 4600 shocks. The Power Wagon is equipped with a 5th Bilstein damper, connected to the rear axle to dampen &quot;power hop&quot;, a symptom of the 5-link rear suspension during wheel spin.

Factory-equipped tires are changed to Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac but remain 33&quot; (285/70R17).

The 2014 Power Wagon is available in 3 trim levels: Tradesman, SLT, and Laramie. The Power Wagon Laramie trim was eliminated after 2017.

===2019 Update===
For the 2019 model year, Ram provided a major overhaul of the Heavy Duty lineup. This included a new, fully boxed frame, entirely new front end, and interior updated similar to the DT Ram 1500. However, mechanically the Power Wagon stayed mostly unchanged from the 2018 model year. Notably, it received the ZF 8-speed transmission, over the outgoing Chrysler built 66RFE 6-speed unit. The Power Wagon becomes its own trim level, while &quot;Power Wagon Package&quot; is still available for &quot;Tradesman&quot; trim 2500&#x27;s, adding the same suspension, axles, wheels/tires, skid plates, and winch as the &quot;Power Wagon&quot; trim version, but in an otherwise more spartan package. For the 2019 model, the winch is updated with a Warn Zeon 12 based unit, with synthetic rope.

====75th Anniversary Edition====
For the 2021 model year, the Power Wagon is offered with a special &quot;75th Anniversary Edition Package&quot;, celebrating the Power Wagon name-plate heritage going back to 1946. The 75AE featured a special &quot;jail bar&quot; vertical bar grille, special badging including an individually numbered plate on dashboard, electronic-shift transfer case, new 17x8.0 beadlock-capable wheels, rock slider steps, special &quot;Mountain Brown&quot; leather bucket seats with center console, and LED projector headlamps borrowed from the top-trim &quot;Limited&quot; models. The 75AE was the first Power Wagon ever available with an electronic shift transfer case, though the option quickly became available on regular Power Wagons. The beadlock capable wheels and rock-slider steps were also later added as available options to regular &quot;Power Wagon&quot; models.

====2025 Update====
All Ram HD trucks, including the Power Wagon, received a facelift for model year 2025. Changes include new headlamps and grilles, tail lamps, and the interior. For 2025 the manual-shift transfer case is discontinued.
===Graphics Packages &amp; Styling===
A large part of the Power Wagon name is its bold styling.

The 2010-2013 Power Wagons were available with a red and black graphics package, with large &quot;Power Wagon&quot; lettering on the tailgate and hood.

2014-2016 Power Wagons in SLT trim received a special red grille, and colorful &quot;splash&quot; graphics down the side of the truck with &quot;Power Wagon&quot; spelled out in large lettering on the doors. A large &quot;Power Wagon&quot; decal is also added to the tailgate and blackout hood decal. Blackout projector headlamps are standard. The Laramie Power Wagon receives only a chrome &quot;Power Wagon&quot; emblem on the tailgate.

2017-2018 saw a slightly more subtle graphics package that pays homage to the late 1970s Dodge Macho Power Wagon, with black lower 2-tone paint tying into a vertical black stripe on the bedsides with &quot;Power Wagon&quot; spelled out. It received a slight change to the &quot;Power Wagon&quot; decal on the tailgate and a black-out decal on the top of the hood.

Starting in 2017 Power Wagons get a unique matte-black &quot;handlebar mustache&quot; grille, and black powder-coat front and rear bumpers, blackout emblems, as well as new black 8-spoke wheels. Laramie and Tradesman trim Power Wagons retained chrome bumpers and regular grilles.

2019 graphics package was largely the same as 2018, but with a slight change in font. A &quot;handlebar mustache&quot; grille is retained but redesigned for the new front end. Blackout LED headlamps are standard as well as blackout emblems.

In 2021, the 75AE received special &quot;outline&quot; Power Wagon decals on the front doors and tailgates and did not have the standard hood decal or vertical bed-side decal. It received a new &quot;jail bar&quot; vertical-bar grille, and special &quot;75 Years of Service&quot; emblems on the C pillars. The “jail bar” grille and outline graphics package became optional on 2022 model year trucks.

<text>The Nakdong River or Nakdonggang (, ) is the longest river in South Korea, which passes through the major cities of Daegu and Busan. It takes its name from its role as the eastern border of the Gaya confederacy during Korea&#x27;s Three Kingdoms Era.

==Geography==
The Nakdong River flows from the Taebaek Mountains to the South Sea or Korea Strait, which separates Korea from Japan. The river originates from the junction of the Cheolamcheon and Hwangjicheon streams in Dongjeom-dong, Taebaek, Gangwon Province. From there to its mouth it winds for about . The width of the river ranges from only a few metres in its upper reaches to several hundred metres towards its estuary.

Major tributaries include the Yeong, Geumho, and Nam rivers. Together with its tributaries, the Nakdonggang drains most of North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang provinces, along with small portions of North Jeolla, South Jeolla, and Gangwon provinces. The total watershed is .

==History==

The Nakdong has played an important role throughout Korean history. The river basin has been a favored dwelling-place for as long as people have inhabited the Korean peninsula. Numerous Neolithic remains have been found in the valley.

Around the 1st century, the valley is believed to have been inhabited by the Byeonhan confederacy tribes. During the Three Kingdoms period, the Gaya confederacy controlled the valley until they were overrun by Silla in 562. These states exploited the river&#x27;s potential for navigation and commerce, operating a thriving trade in armor and weapons with neighboring countries, including Yamato period Japan. Through the Silla, Goryeo, and Joseon periods, the river continued to serve as a major transportation corridor in the Gyeongsang region. It was especially used for transporting inland fresh seafood, such as mackerel, which were salted and dried to prevent them from spoiling. The city of Andong was the farthest inland the fish could be brought before going bad, so many people flocked there during the Joseon dynasty to eat fish.

As a barrier to movement, the Nakdong River gained sudden prominence during the Korean War. The southern length of the river formed the western portion of the Pusan Perimeter, which the UN forces fought to maintain during the autumn of 1950. The bridge at Waegwan was blown up on August 3, 1950, in an effort to prevent North Korean forces from advancing on Daegu. A large number of South Korean refugees were killed in the explosion. Although some North Korean forces did cross the Nakdong River in places, for the most part the river marked their furthest advance.

==Ecology==
The Nakdong River valley includes numerous floodplain wetlands, the most well-known of which are the Junamjeosuji Reservoir near Changwon and Upo Wetland in Changnyeong County. These wetlands, while significantly degraded and overdeveloped, provide habitat to a significant number of rare and threatened species, most especially birds (such as the Baikal teal and White-naped crane), fish and plants.

Despite being home to the bustling Port of Busan, the Nakdonggang estuary is internationally important for waterbirds, despite recent ecologically-destructive developments including reclamation for housing and industry (e.g. the Busan New Port), the ongoing construction of a major bridge (the Miyeonji Bridge) and most recently the threatened construction of the Korean Grand Canal project.

The Nakdonggang and its tributaries serve as a major source of drinking water for the inhabitants of the river basin and others nearby. However, water pollution from domestic and agricultural wastewater remains a serious concern.

=== Phenol contamination ===
In 1991, there were two incidents where phenol was leaked into the river from Doosan Electronics. There were two leaks, the first thirty tons on March 14, 1991 and the second 1.3 tons on April 22. The phenol ended up at a water processing facility used for drinking water in Daegu and began to smell after converting to chlorophenol when the water was sanitized with chlorine.

==Economic role==

Although all but the southernmost reaches of the Nakdonggang River have ceased to serve as a major commercial waterway, the river continues to feed those dwelling near it, both directly through fishing and indirectly through irrigation. Substantial amounts of snails and catfish are taken from the waters and used in local cuisine.

Near Andong, a series of massive hydroelectric dams have been constructed, creating a small chain of artificial lakes of which Andong Lake is the largest. These lakes also support a substantial recreational industry. Bass fishing is especially popular, since the lakes have been artificially stocked with bass.

In the early 2010s, the Nakdonggang River was to be part of President Lee Myung-bak&#x27;s canal project, the Grand Korean Waterway. The project would link the Nakdong with the Han River to the north, creating a shipping canal spanning length of the country, from Seoul to Busan. Encountering considerable controversy nationwide as well as from residents along the Nakdonggang, the waterway project was scrapped by the end of Lee&#x27;s presidency.

== Festival ==
The Nakdong River Cultural Center holds bicycle festivals that everyone can enjoy the healthy leisure culture of local residents. It is composed of flat courses about 20 km in the vicinity of Eulsukdo and Nakdonggang River Cultural Center.

<doc id="1183833" wikidata="Q2933076" url="?curid=1183833" title="Cahaba River">
<text>The Cahaba River is the longest substantially free-flowing river in Alabama. It is a major tributary of the Alabama River and part of the larger Mobile River basin. With headwaters near Birmingham, the Cahaba flows southwest, then at Heiberger turns southeast and joins the Alabama River at the ghost town and former Alabama capital of Cahaba in Dallas County. Entirely within central Alabama, the Cahaba River is long and drains an area of . The name Cahaba is derived from the Choctaw words &quot;oka&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot; and &quot;aba&quot; meaning &quot;above&quot;

==Geography==
The Cahaba River flows across three physiographic provinces of the state: Appalachian Plateau, Ridge and Valley, and Coastal Plain. The Mobile River basin has the largest Gulf Coast drainage basin east of the Mississippi River, and the Cahaba is one of the seven river systems that contribute to its flow. The mean discharge of water from 1938 to 2000 is about 80 m3/s. The average rainfall is 138 cm/yr. The terrestrial biome of the river is classified as eastern deciduous forest.

==Course==
The Cahaba River begins in the Valley and Ridge region bounded by the Piedmont to the southeast and the Cumberland Plateau to the northwest. It has two major physical regions: Upper and Lower Cahaba. The river empties into the Alabama River. The upper Cahaba forms roughly the first 100 miles, starting at the headwaters and continuing to the Fall Line, a region in which the Appalachian Mountains end and the Gulf Coastal Plain begins. It passes through Trussville, Leeds, Irondale, Birmingham, Mountain Brook, Hoover, Vestavia, Helena, West Blocton, and Centreville. The lower Cahaba begins at the fall line and continues through Selma and empties into the Alabama River at the former town of Cahaba.

==History==

===Precolonization ===
Located adjacent to the Cahaba River basin, the Moundville Archaeological Site (1000–1450 AD) was the second-largest community of the Mississippian culture. The Black Warrior River and the Cahaba River run parallel to each other for over 100 miles, often as close as 30 miles apart. The Bottle Creek Site (1250–1550 AD), located little more than 100 miles downriver in the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta, also influenced the region. A large mound remains on the river, just south of Centerville. A large village occupied the town of Cahaba site from 100 to 1550 AD, during the Woodland and Mississippian periods.

===The town of Cahaba===
The Cahaba River ends at the former town of Cahaba, also known as Cahawba, or Old Cahawba. The town of Cahaba was Alabama&#x27;s first seat of government from 1820 to 1825. William Wyatt Bibb, Alabama&#x27;s first governor, decided on Cahaba because of the scenery, fertile area, and navigable river ways. Cahaba suffered harsh economic struggles and disease from 1819 to 1822. However, in 1821, a steamboat, the &quot;Harriet&quot;, overcame the Alabama River&#x27;s fast current and made it past Cahaba. The river became a major trade route, which caused the city to grow, despite the removal of the capital to Tuscaloosa in 1825. Cahaba is now an abandoned town and a state historical site, administered by the Alabama Historical Commission.

==Geology==
The Ridge and Valley region of Alabama, which is where the Cahaba River begins, was formed when the African Plate collided with the North American Plate in the Paleozoic era. The valley soils consist of gravel, sand, and clay, while the ridges consist of chert and sandstone. The upper Cahaba region contains Cenozoic-era gravel, clay, and sand. In the lower Cahaba region, the soils are calcareous, or chalky.

==Ecology==

The waters of the Cahaba are home to more than 131 species of freshwater fishes (18 of which have been found in no other river system), 40 species of mussels, and 35 species of snails. The river has more fish species than can be found in all bodies of water in California. Sixty-nine of these animal species are endangered. The endemic freshwater snail &quot;Elimia cahawbensis&quot; is named after the river. One species long thought to be extinct, &quot;Leptoxis compacta&quot;, the Oblong rocksnail, was rediscovered in the Cahaba in 2011. Due to damming for hydropower, pollution, transportation, and erosion, it has suffered losses of species. Almost a quarter of the original documented mussel species in the Cahaba have disappeared with similar trends in the fish and snail numbers of species. Many species have still been discovered and rediscovered in and on the surrounding region of the river. The Cahaba is also home to 13 snail species not found anywhere else in the world. In the early 21st century, a Georgia botanist Jim Allison discovered eight unknown flower species, and later eight more were identified along the river&#x27;s course that previously had not been sited in the state of Alabama. This region is most noted for containing numerous species of mollusks and snails. These species feed other aquatic dwelling animals, improve water quality by eating algae, and even indicate environmental issues due to their receptiveness of pollution. Fourteen of the freshwater fish species are non-native species in the Cahaba River.

===Cahaba lily===

Among the countless plant species that thrive in and around the Cahaba is &quot;Hymenocallis coronaria&quot;, known in Alabama as the Cahaba lily. As a result of its abundant presence here and its threatened status in the three states where it is found, a portion of the Cahaba River near West Blocton has been designated as the Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge. It is found only in South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. While this flower once was present through all of the Southeast, it now exists in about 70 stands with a fourth of the stands in the Cahaba River. The seeds travel with the river&#x27;s flow, and crevices in the shoals (rocky bars that run across the river) shelter the seeds as they sprout. The Cahaba lilies bloom in early May, and the entire blooming season is through by mid-June. The flowers open in the evening instead of the day due to pollination by sphinx moths, which are active at night. Each flower blooms and lasts only one day before wilting.

==Tributaries==

There are numerous small tributaries, including:
*Buck Creek, northwest of Helena
* Little Cahaba River (of Shelby County), entering from the southeast, by Cahaba Heights
* Little Cahaba River (of Bibb County), entering from the east some miles north of Centreville
* Shades Creek, entering from the northwest after running parallel to the Cahaba for some time

==Water use==
The Cahaba flows through heavily populated areas in the Birmingham metropolitan area. It serves as the source of drinking water in the upper course for over 1 million people and is also a popular canoeing destination.

==Major cities==
A number of Alabama cities lie on the banks of or in close proximity to the river. They include:
* Trussville —Cahaba headwaters
* Birmingham – Cahaba headwaters
* Hoover – Cahaba runs southwest
* Helena – Cahaba runs southwest
* Centreville – Cahaba runs southwest
* Heiberger – Cahaba turns 90 degrees to southeast
* Marion – Cahaba runs southeast (east of Marion)
* Selma – Cahaba runs southeast (west of Selma)
* Cahaba – joins the Alabama River at the 1st permanent state capital, now a state historic site

==Advocacy==
* The Cahaba Riverkeeper conducts weekly monitoring of recreational access and posts results at www.cahabariverkeeper.org/swimguide. The mission of CRK is to defend the ecological integrity of the Cahaba river and to ensure clean water, a healthy aquatic environment, and the recreational and aesthetic values of the river. CRK conducts additional monitoring to identify violations of clean water legislation.
* The Cahaba River Society is Alabama&#x27;s largest watershed conservation organization and is recognized nationally for river stewardship. CRS&#x27;s success is due to a balanced, science-based, and inclusive approach. Its mission is to restore and protect the Cahaba River watershed and its rich diversity of life.
* The Nature Conservancy Sustainable Waters Program The Sustainable Waters Program works with a range of partners to address freshwater issues relating to farms, energy, cities and floodplains.
* The Cahaba River Basin Clean Water Partnership mission is to identify issues, explore solutions, and make recommendations for the management and stewardship of the Cahaba River basin while maintaining the balance between protecting the environment and promoting the economy.
* The Alabama Rivers Alliance works to unite the citizens of Alabama to protect peoples right to clean, healthy, waters.
* Alabama Water Watch is dedicated to volunteer citizen monitoring of water quality in Alabama Rivers.
* The Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley, the regional governing body for the Presbyterian Church (USA) in central Alabama, is developing a camp and conference center on the Cahaba River called Living River. PSL is working diligently to develop this center in an environmentally sound way, and to protect the river. PSL helped remove the Marvel Slab Dam in partnership with many other organizations, which helped a large portion of the river return to its natural, free flowing state.
* The Freshwater Land Trust, a nonprofit organization whose mission is the acquisition and stewardship of lands that enhance water quality and preserve open space in Central Alabama. Website:

<text>The Sunshine State Conference is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. All of its member institutions are located in the state of Florida, which is popularly known as the Sunshine State.

The conference was originally formed in 1975 as a men&#x27;s basketball conference. It has since expanded to sponsor championships in 18 sports, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s rowing, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s volleyball.

SSC institutions have won a total of 111 NCAA national team championships, including a conference record seven in the 2014–15 and 2018–19 academic years. The conference has also claimed a total of 90 national runner-up trophies.

==History==
The conference was preceded by the Florida Intercollegiate Conference, which was disbanded in the mid-1960s. The Sunshine State Conference was founded in 1975 by Saint Leo University (then Saint Leo College) basketball coach &amp; athletic director Norm Kaye. Kaye served as Commissioner the first year until Dick Pace was named Commissioner in 1976. Kaye continued as Executive Director of the Conference for an additional 12 years. Pace was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.

The six charter Conference members were: Biscayne College (now St. Thomas University), Florida Technological University (now University of Central Florida), Eckerd College, Florida Southern College, Rollins College, and Saint Leo College.

The Conference has seen dozens of athletes go on to have successful professional careers. Some examples include: Current PGA Tour players Lee Janzen and Rocco Mediate went to Florida Southern. Janzen won golf&#x27;s U.S. Open in 1993 &amp; 1998; on the baseball side are Tino Martinez (Tampa), Tim Wakefield (Florida Tech), Ryan Hanigan (Rollins), Bob Tewksbury (Saint Leo), and J. D. Martinez (Nova Southeastern). Wakefield tied a career high of 17 wins pitching for the 2007 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox and Tewksbury was third in balloting for the National League Cy Young Award while going 16–5 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1992.

===Controversy===
On July 17, 2007, NCAA vacated Lynn&#x27;s 2005 Women&#x27;s Division II Softball Championship due to extra benefits given to two players. The NCAA found that former coach Thomas Macera gave two Lynn softball players cash payments totaling more than $3,000. Lynn was also placed on probation for two years. As of 2019-20 Lynn University has won 15 national championships at the Division II level, but now the NCAA recognizes only 14 of them because of the unsanctioned actions.

<text>Gottlieb Wilhelm Rabener (17 September 1714 – 22 March 1771), was a German writer of prose satires and publicist of the Enlightenment. He was born at Wachau near Leipzig, and he died at Dresden.

In 1741 he made his debut as satirist in Schwabe&#x27;s &quot;Belustigungen des Verstandes und Witzes&quot;, and was subsequently a contributor to the &quot;Bremer Beitrage&quot;. Rabener&#x27;s satires are mainly levelled at the follies of the middle classes.

The papers which he published in the Bremer Beitrage were subsequently collected in a &quot;Sammlung satirischer Schriften&quot; (2 vols., 1751), to which two volumes were added in 1755.

Rabener is especially notorious for his parodic dissertation, &quot;Hinkmars von Repkow Noten Ohne Text&quot;, which levels a snide charge against the futility and bankruptcy of the practice of footnoting, by consisting entirely of footnotes itself. Rabener cavalierly claimed that since footnotes and endnotes seemed to have become the key to winning lasting authorial fame, he had accordingly composed his dissertation entirely in notes, and left it to others to produce the text he had annotated proleptically.

People like Dr. Benjamin Franklin &amp; Thomas Paine were influenced by the Enlightenment, it could be said Rabener and other writers of his time were a driving force behind this movement.

He came to Dresden in 1753, lost most of his manuscripts during the Seven Year War, at the siege of Dresden by the Prussians in July 1760. But his complete works &quot;Briefe&quot; were published in 1772 by Christian Felix Weiße (1726-1804).

By 1763 Rabener was promoted to the tax council in Dresden, he suffers his first stroke in 1767, a painting titled and dated verso,&quot;Steuerralh Gottlieb Wilhelm Rabener,&quot; oil on canvas is created after his second stroke in 1769 now currently held in a private collection. Not much is known of his tax collecting for Frederick the Great or the last years before his death, but it seems the strokes could have been a factor.

<text>The Members is a British punk band that originated in Camberley, Surrey, England. In the UK, they are best known for their single &quot;The Sound of the Suburbs&quot;, reaching No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and in Australia, &quot;Radio&quot; which reached No. 5 in 1982.

==Career==

The Members were formed by lyricist Nicky Tesco (Nick Lightowlers) in 1976, through an invited audition at a recording studio at Tooley Street, London. The original personnel, with Tesco (vocals), was Gary Baker (guitar), and Steve Morley (bass guitar), initially with Steve Maycock then Clive Parker (drums). Morley and Parker were later replaced by Chris Payne and Adrian Lillywhite.
In 1976, the band performed for its first engagements at The Red Cow (London W6), The Windsor Castle (London W9) and The Nashville Rooms (London W14). In that year, composer Jean Marie Carroll (aka JC Carroll) joined the band to complement Tesco&#x27;s lyrics. The Members had recorded a number of songs, but the first released recording was &quot;Fear on the Streets&quot;, produced by Lillywhite&#x27;s brother Steve Lillywhite. This song was included on the first record released by the Beggars Banquet label, who made the punk compilation &quot;Streets&quot; (1977). The song-writing collaboration between Tesco and Carroll moved The Members&#x27; sound towards an incorporation of reggae, shown in the first single released for Stiff Records, &quot;Solitary Confinement&quot;, produced by Larry Wallis. Following these releases, the band personnel became Tesco (vocals), Carroll (vocals and guitar), Nigel Bennett (guitar), Payne (bass) and Lillywhite (drums).

In 1978/79, the Members continued to play the London pub and club circuit, became a feature in the music press and were championed by John Peel. They signed to Virgin Records in 1978, for which label they recorded &quot;The Sound of the Suburbs&quot;, again produced by Steve Lillywhite. This became The Members&#x27; biggest chart success and their best-known song in the UK. However, the follow-up single, &quot;Offshore Banking Business&quot;, a reggae tune written by Carroll, based on his experiences working in offshore banking at the private bank Coutts, did not achieve the same popularity. A version of &quot;Offshore Banking Business&quot; was recorded for the early 1980s film &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;, produced by Michael White, and distributed by Filmways and Lorimar Productions.

The Members&#x27; first album, &quot;At the Chelsea Nightclub&quot;, was followed by a second for Virgin, &quot;1980 – The Choice Is Yours&quot;. Augmented by saxophonists Steve (Rudi) Thomson and Simon Lloyd (the latter of whom also provided horns and additional keyboards), the group recorded what would turn out to be their final album. This last album was first issued in the US as &quot;Uprhythm, Downbeat&quot; in 1982, and it surfaced in the UK a year later, with a new title called &quot;Going West&quot;. The album featured the singles &quot;Radio,&quot; which made no. 5 in Australia, and &quot;Working Girl&quot;, the music video for which gave the band exposure in North America via MTV.

The band broke up in 1983, when Tesco left the band after the last tour of the US. JC Carroll formed the UK fashion house, The Dispensary, with his then wife Sophy Lynn and began working on film soundtracks, most notably with film producer Stephen Malit and director Julien Temple. Lillywhite went on to join the band King in the mid-1980s in time for their second album. Lloyd soon joined the Australian band Icehouse, remaining with them for their international smash hits &quot;Electric Blue&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;. In 1989, Tesco appeared in &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot;, written and directed by Aki Kaurismäki, a film about a fictional Russian rock band touring the US. This fictional band then toured as an actual band, and recorded the Tesco song &quot;Thru the Wire&quot;. Kaurismäki directed a video for &quot;Thru the Wire&quot;, featuring Tesco. As well as working as a music journalist for the magazine &quot;Music Week&quot;, Tesco became a commentator on new releases for BBC 6 Music&#x27;s &quot;Roundtable&quot;.

==Reunion incarnation==
In 2008, the original line up of the band reformed to play two concerts, then a line up of Carroll, Payne and Nick Cash resumed touring. In 2009, a new single &quot;International Financial Crisis&quot; (a re-write of &quot;Offshore Banking Business&quot;) was released, recorded by Tesco, Carroll, Payne and Bennett, with artwork by the original Members&#x27; album sleeve designer, Malcolm Garrett. This line up played Glastonbury and Isle of Wight Festivals. The Members line-up of Carroll, Payne and Rat Scabies (drums) performed from 2010 to 2013, playing over 90 shows including three European tours and New Zealand and Australian tours. Nick Cash rejoined the band in 2014.

In March 2012, the Members released their fourth studio album, &quot;InGrrLand&quot;, featuring Carroll, Payne, Bennett, Cash and Rat Scabies. In December 2013, Nigel Bennett rejoined the Members. In 2014, the Members (comprising Carroll, Bennett and Cash), mounted a 23-date tour of the US; Carroll on bass guitar and lead vocals, Bennett on lead guitar, and Cash on drums. This was the band&#x27;s first tour of the US for 32 years.

In 2015, the band began work on their fifth studio album in studios in London and West Byfleet featuring a nucleus of Carroll, Cash, Payne and Bennett together with guest appearances from Guy Pratt and guitarist Steve Brookes. &quot;One Law&quot;, released in early 2016, was produced by Carroll, and received reviews in Louder Than War, &quot;The Aberdeen Voice&quot;, &quot;Record Collector&quot; and &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot;.

In 2021, the band released their seventh studio album &quot;Bedsitland&quot; and JC Carroll&#x27;s definitive story of the band, &quot;Still Annoying the Neighbours&quot;, was published.

Since reforming the Members have performed all over the world; and apart from a break for the COVID pandemic, they continue to perform.

On 26 February 2022, it was announced that Tesco had died, at the age of 67. The BBC&#x27;s Johnnie Walker and JC Carroll paid tribute to Tesco on the &quot;Sounds of the 70&#x27;s&quot; BBC radio show.

<doc id="1183849" wikidata="Q7435720" url="?curid=1183849" title="Scotney Castle">
<text>Scotney Castle is an English country house with formal gardens south-east of Lamberhurst in the valley of the River Bewl in Kent, England. It belongs to the National Trust.

The gardens, which are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a celebrated example of the picturesque style, are open to the public. The central feature is the ruins of a medieval, moated manor house, Scotney Old Castle, which is on an island on a small lake. The lake is surrounded by sloping, wooded gardens with fine collections of rhododendrons, azaleas and kalmia for spring colour, summer wisteria and roses, and spectacular autumn colour.

At the top of the garden stands a house which was built to replace the Old Castle between 1835 and 1843. This is known as Scotney New Castle, or simply Scotney Castle, and was designed by Anthony Salvin. It is an early and unusually restrained example of Tudor Revival architectural style in 19th-century Britain. Following the death of the resident, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006, this house was opened to the public for the first time on 6 June 2007.

==Location==

Scotney Castle is located in South East England, in the county of Kent.
Nearby settlements are Lamberhurst and Kilndown, however the nearest large town is Royal Tunbridge Wells away. Although the A21 main road passes the grounds, it cannot be seen from the Castle.

==History==

The earliest record from 1137 gives the owner of the estate as Lambert de Scoteni. Roger Ashburnham is credited with building the castle c.1378–80.

Construction of the castle began as a roughly rectangular fortified house with towers in each corner. The original plan may never have been finished, and by 1558 it is likely only the southern tower remained. In 1580 the south wing was rebuilt in Elizabethan architecture style, and around 1630 the eastern range was rebuilt in three-story Inigo Jones style. The Elizabethan wing remained a bailiff&#x27;s residence until 1905, but the eastern range was partly dismantled on the completion of the new house in 1843, leaving the ruin as a garden feature.

The Recusant owner Thomas Darrell hid Jesuit Father Richard Blount, S.J. in the castle while he ministered to Roman Catholics from 1591 to 1598. Catholicism was then illegal in England, and during the second raid by authorities to arrest the priest he fled over a wall into the moat and escaped.

The Darrell family owned the estate for some 350 years. In 1778 Edward Hussey bought the estate and his grandson, also Edward, built the &#x27;new&#x27; Castle to the designs of Anthony Salvin, from sandstone quarried from the slope below. The hollow created was developed into a Quarry Garden and contains a 100-million-year-old impression of a dinosaur&#x27;s footprint.

On Christopher Hussey&#x27;s death in 1970 the estate was left to the National Trust. Several apartments in the castle and on the estate were let out by the Trust, with tenants including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who rented the Belfry flat for a time during the 1970s and 1980s, when it served as a weekend escape for her from Westminster life. When her husband Denis Thatcher was made a baronet in 1990, his new title was gazetted with the territorial designation &quot;of Scotney in the County of Kent&quot;.

The castle grounds have played host to Shakespeare productions, notably &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, with the actors appearing from behind the bushes on cue.

Old Scotney Castle was used as the location for the video to the Squeeze song &quot;Some Fantastic Place&quot;.

<text>The term managed care or managed healthcare is used in the United States to describe a group of activities intended to reduce the cost of providing health care and providing American health insurance while improving the quality of that care (&quot;managed care techniques&quot;). It has become the predominant system of delivering and receiving American health care since its implementation in the early 1980s, and has been largely unaffected by the Affordable Care Act of 2010.
...intended to reduce unnecessary health care costs through a variety of mechanisms, including: economic incentives for physicians and patients to select less costly forms of care; programs for reviewing the medical necessity of specific services; increased beneficiary cost sharing; controls on inpatient admissions and lengths of stay; the establishment of cost-sharing incentives for outpatient surgery; selective contracting with health care providers; and the intensive management of high-cost health care cases. The programs may be provided in a variety of settings, such as Health Maintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider Organizations.
The growth of managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the enactment of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were pioneered by health maintenance organizations, they are now used by a variety of private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in the U.S., but has attracted controversy because it has had mixed results in its overall goal of controlling medical costs. Proponents and critics are also sharply divided on managed care&#x27;s overall impact on U.S. health care delivery, which underperforms in terms of quality and is among the worst with regard to access, efficiency, and equity in the developed world.

==History==
Dr. Paul Starr suggests in his analysis of the American healthcare system (i.e., &quot;The Social Transformation of American Medicine&quot;) that Richard Nixon, advised by the &quot;father of Health Maintenance Organizations&quot;, Dr. Paul M. Ellwood Jr., was the first mainstream political leader to take deliberate steps to change American health care from its longstanding not-for-profit business principles into a for-profit model that would be driven by the insurance industry. In 1973, Congress passed the Health Maintenance Organization Act, which encouraged rapid growth of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), the first form of managed care.

=== Early origins ===
Before healthcare plans emerged, patients would simply pay for services out of pocket. In the period between 1910 and 1940, early healthcare plans formed into two models: a capitated plan (essentially an HMO), and a plan which paid service providers, such as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans. One of the earliest examples is a 1910 &quot;prepaid group plan&quot; in Tacoma, Washington for lumber mills. Blue Cross (hospital care) and Blue Shield (professional service) plans began in 1929 with a prepaid plan with Baylor Hospital, spreading to other hospitals over the next several decades; these plans were largely independent of each other and controlled by statewide hospitals and physicians until the 1970s, when they became nonprofits before being converted into for-profit corporations such as Anthem.

=== 1980s expansion and subdued inflation ===
Managed care plans are widely credited with subduing medical cost inflation in the late 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing the health care industry to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts are driven by the need to generate profits and not providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997. In response, close to 900 state laws were passed regulating managed care in the 1990s.

The backlash featured vocal critics, including disgruntled patients and consumer-advocacy groups, who argued that managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care. The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards. Meanwhile, insurers responded to public demands and political pressure by beginning to offer other plan options with more comprehensive care networks—according to one analysis, between the years 1970 and 2005, the share of personal health expenditures paid directly out-of-pocket by U.S. consumers fell from about 40 percent to 15 percent. So, although consumers faced rising health insurance premiums over the period, lower out-of-pocket costs likely encouraged consumers to use more health care. Data indicating whether this increase in use was due to voluntary or optional service purchases or the sudden access lower-income citizens had to basic healthcare is not available here at this time.

=== 1990s growth and ubiquity ===
By the late 1990s, U.S. per capita healthcare spending began to increase again, peaking around 2002. Despite managed care&#x27;s mandate to control costs, U.S. healthcare expenditures have continued to outstrip the overall national income, rising about 2.4 percentage points faster than the annual GDP since 1970.

Nevertheless, according to the trade association America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans, 90 percent of insured Americans are now enrolled in plans with some form of managed care. &quot;The National Directory of Managed Care Organizations, Sixth Edition&quot; profiles more than 5,000 plans, including new consumer-driven health plans and health savings accounts. In addition, 26 states have contracts with MCOs to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs.

== Techniques ==

One of the most characteristic forms of managed care is the use of a panel or network of healthcare providers to provide care to enrollees. Such integrated delivery systems typically include one or more of the following:
* Designated doctors and healthcare facilities, known as a provider network, which enrollees are required or incentivized to use
* Formal utilization review and quality improvement programs including disease management and case management
* An emphasis on preventive care including wellness incentives and patient education

The techniques can be applied to both network-based benefit programs and benefit programs that are not based on a provider network. The use of managed care techniques without a provider network is sometimes described as &quot;managed indemnity&quot;.

=== Cost sharing ===
High-deductible health plans are used by insurers to keep costs down by incentivizing consumers to select cheaper providers and possibly utilize less healthcare.

Reference price schemes are another method to share costs, where a health insurer will only pay a certain amount and anything above that must be paid out of pocket.

=== Provider networks ===
Insurance plan companies, such as UnitedHealth Group, negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiations; contracts may be discontinued from time to time. High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute between UnitedHealth Group and a major emergency room doctor group Envision Healthcare.

Maintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary as CMS can fine insurers with outdated directories. As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers. However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.

When patients receive care from doctors who are out of network, they can be subject to balance billing; this is particularly common in emergency or hospital care, where the patient may not be notified that a provider is out of network.

=== Utilization review ===
Utilization management (UM) or utilization review is the use of managed care techniques such as prior authorization that allow payers to manage the cost of health care benefits by assessing its appropriateness before it is provided using evidence-based criteria or guidelines. UM criteria are medical guidelines which may be developed in house, acquired from a vendor, or acquired and adapted to suit local conditions. Two commonly used UM criteria frameworks are the McKesson InterQual criteria and MCG (previously known as the Milliman Care Guidelines).

=== Lawsuits ===
In the 21st century, commercial payers were increasingly using litigation against providers to combat alleged fraud or abuse. Examples included litigation between Aetna and a group of surgical centers over an out-of-network overbilling scheme and kickbacks for referrals, where Aetna was ultimately awarded $37 million. While Aetna has led the initiative, other health insurance companies have engaged in similar efforts.

==Organizations==
There is a continuum of organizations that provide managed care, each operating with slightly different business models. Some organizations are made of physicians, and others are combinations of physicians, hospitals, and other providers. Here is a list of common organizations:
* Group practice without walls
* Independent practice association
* Management services organization
* Physician practice management company (PPM)

=== Industry in the United States ===

As of 2017, the largest commercial plans were Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Health Care Service Corp, UnitedHealthcare, and Centene Corporation. As of 2017, there were 907 health insurance companies in the United States, although the top 10 account for about 53% of revenue and the top 100 account for 95% of revenue.

Smaller regional or startup plans are offered by Oscar Health, Moda Health, and Premera.

Provider-sponsored health plans can form integrated delivery systems; the largest of these as of 2015 was Kaiser Permanente.

Kaiser Permanente was the highest-ranked commercial plan by consumer satisfaction in 2018 with a different survey finding it tied with Humana.

As of 2017, Medicaid and Medicare have become an increasingly large part of the private health insurance industry, particularly with the rise of Medicare Advantage programs. As of 2018, two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees are in plans administered by private companies for a set fee. These may involve some sort of value-based system; in addition, the contracted companies may be evaluated on population health statistics, as in the case of California&#x27;s Medi-Cal which tasked its companies with improving the health of its members.

==Types==
There are several types of network-based managed care programs. They range from more restrictive to less restrictive:

=== Health maintenance organization (HMO) ===
Proposed in the 1960s by Dr. Paul Elwood in the &quot;Health Maintenance Strategy&quot;, the HMO concept was promoted by the Nixon administration as a fix to rising health care costs and set in law as the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. As defined in the act, a federally-qualified HMO would, in exchange for a subscriber fee (premium), allow members access to a panel of employed physicians or a network of doctors and facilities including hospitals. In return, the HMO received mandated market access and could receive federal development funds.

They are licensed at the state level, under a license that is known as a certificate of authority (COA), rather than under an insurance license. In 1972, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operations. In practice, an HMO is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and the delivery of health care for enrollees. In the design of the plan, each member is assigned a &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, a primary care physician (PCP) responsible for the overall care of members assigned. Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also require specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by the HMO unless it defines the situation to be an emergency.

Financial sanctions for use of emergency facilities in non-emergency situations were once an issue, but prudent layperson language now applies to all emergency-service utilization, and penalties are rare.

Since the 1980s, under the ERISA Act passed in Congress in 1974 and its preemptive effect on state common law tort lawsuits that &quot;relate to&quot; Employee Benefit Plans, HMOs administering benefits through private employer health plans have been protected by federal law from malpractice litigation, on the grounds that the decisions regarding patient care are administrative rather than medical in nature. See &quot;Cigna v. Calad&quot;, 2004.

===Independent practice association (IPA)===

An Independent Practice Association is a legal entity that contracts with a group of physicians to provide service to the HMO&#x27;s members. Most often, the physicians are paid on a basis of capitation, which in this context means a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to that physician or group of physicians, whether or not that person seeks care. The contract is not usually exclusive so individual doctors or the group may sign contracts with multiple HMOs. Physicians who participate in IPAs usually also serve fee-for-service patients not associated with managed care.

IPAs usually have a governing board to determine the best forms of practices.

===Preferred provider organization (PPO)===

Rather than contract with the various insurers and third party administrators, providers may contract with preferred provider organizations. A membership allows a substantial discount below their regularly charged rates from the designated professionals partnered with the organization. Preferred provider organizations themselves earn money by charging an access fee to the insurance company for the use of their network (unlike the usual insurance with premiums and corresponding payments paid fully or partially by the insurance provider to the medical doctor).

In terms of using such a plan, unlike an HMO plan, which has a copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment generally paid at the time of service), a PPO generally does not have a copayment but offers a deductible and a coinsurance feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the coinsurance benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, the patient pays 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. The insurer will pay 80% of the other fees, and the patient will pay the remaining 20%. Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.

Because the patient is picking up a substantial portion of the &quot;first dollars&quot; of coverage, PPO are the least expensive types of coverage.

===Point of service (POS)===

A POS plan uses some of the features of each of the above plans. Members of a POS plan do not make a choice about which system to use until the service is being used.

In terms of using such a plan, a POS plan has levels of progressively higher patient financial participation, as the patient moves away from the more managed features of the plan. For example, if patients stay in a network of providers and seeks a referral to use a specialist, they may have a copayment only. However, if they use an out of network provider but do not seek a referral, they will pay more.

POS plans are becoming more popular because they offer more flexibility and freedom of choice than standard HMOs.

===Private fee-for-service (PFFS)===
There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences, and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.

Fee-for-service coverage falls into Basic and Major Medical Protection categories. Basic protection deals with costs of a hospital room, hospital services, care and supplies, cost of surgery in or out of hospital, and doctor visits. Major Medical Protection covers costs of serious illnesses and injuries, which usually require long-term treatment and rehabilitation period. Basic and Major Medical Insurance coverage combined are called a Comprehensive Health Care Plan. Policies do not cover some services.

===Managed care in indemnity insurance plans===
Many &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;indemnity&quot; health insurance plans now incorporate some managed care features, such as precertification for non-emergency hospital admissions and utilization reviews. They are sometimes described as &quot;managed indemnity&quot; plans.

==Impacts==
The overall impact of managed care remains widely debated. Proponents argue that it has increased efficiency, improved overall standards, and led to a better understanding of the relationship and quality. They argue that there is no consistent, direct correlation between the cost of care and its quality, pointing to a 2002 Juran Institute study which estimated that the &quot;cost of poor quality&quot; caused by overuse, misuse, and waste amounts to 30 percent of all direct healthcare spending. The emerging practice of evidence-based medicine is being used to determine when lower-cost medicine may in fact be more effective.

Critics of managed care argue that &quot;for-profit&quot; managed care has been an unsuccessful health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25–33% higher overhead at some of the largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied downward pressure on quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 quality indicators reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance).

The most common managed care financial arrangement, capitation, places healthcare providers in the role of micro-health insurers, assuming the responsibility for managing the unknown future health care costs of their patients. Small insurers, like individual consumers, tend to have annual costs that fluctuate far more than larger insurers. The term &quot;Professional Caregiver Insurance Risk&quot; explains the inefficiencies in health care finance that result when insurance risks are inefficiently transferred to health care providers who are expected to cover such costs in return for their capitation payments. As Cox (2006) demonstrates, providers cannot be adequately compensated for their insurance risks without forcing managed care organizations to become price uncompetitive vis-a-vis risk retaining insurers. Cox (2010) shows that smaller insurers have lower probabilities of modest profits than large insurers, higher probabilities of high losses than large insurers, provide lower benefits to policyholders, and have far higher surplus requirements. All these effects work against the viability of healthcare provider insurance risk assumption.

== Performance measurements ==
As managed care became popular, health care quality became an important aspect. The HMO Act in 1973 included a voluntary program of &quot;federal qualification&quot;, which became popular, but over time this role was largely taken over by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which began accrediting plans in 1991. Accreditation by the NCQA is often expected or require by employers. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a prominent set of measurements and reporting on it is often mandated by states as well as Medicare; as of 2017, HEDIS data was collected for plans covering 81% of the insured.

Performance measurements can be burdensome on doctors; as of 2017, there were an estimated 900 performance measurements, of which 81 were covered by HEDIS, and providers used a combination of electronic health records and manual data entry to collect and report on the data.

Aside from the NCQA, other organizations involved in quality include the Joint Commission, URAC, Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, with all these groups coordinating in the National Quality Forum.

A comparison of HEDIS metrics reported in 2006 and 2007 for Medicare Advantage and Medicare fee-for-service plans found a mixed picture.

== Unmanaged care ==
The French healthcare system as it existed in the 1990s was cited as an &quot;unmanaged&quot; system, where patients could select their provider without the types of networks and utilization review found in the United States.

== Opposition in Australia ==
In June 2021 Australian specialist doctors mounted a campaign to resist the introduction of US style managed care by health fund nib Health Funds in association with Cigna.

<text>Michel Colombier (23 May 1939 – 14 November 2004) was a French composer, arranger, and conductor.

==Career==
Colombier wrote the scores of several motion pictures and TV productions. He also wrote chamber music and ballets. With composer Pierre Henry he wrote music for &quot;Messe pour le temps présent&quot;, a piece created by choreographer Maurice Béjart in 1967. He released an album on A&amp;M Records, &quot;Wings&quot;, in 1971, which included a collaboration with Lani Hall on lead vocal, his song &quot;We Could Be Flying&quot;, with lyrics by Paul Williams. Recorded in Paris, with Colombier on piano, it was also included on the album &quot;Sun Down Lady&quot;, Lani Hall&#x27;s first solo album after her years as lead singer for Sérgio Mendes and Brazil 66, released in 1972 on A&amp;M Records.

Colombier&#x27;s piece &quot;Emmanuel&quot; was named after and written in memory of his young son, who died in infancy. It was used by the French television channel Antenne 2 (now known as France 2), alongside an 80-second animation known as (The Flying Men), by Jean-Michel Folon, as part of its sign-on and sign-off sequences between 1975 and 1983 in addition to the cover of the 1977 re-release of his 1971 album &quot;Wings&quot;.

==Death==

Colombier died from cancer shortly after midnight on 14 November 2004. He left behind a widow, Dana Colombier, with whom he fathered two children. He is interred in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Los Angeles.

<doc id="1183874" wikidata="Q756011" url="?curid=1183874" title="Rummy">
<text>Rummy is a group of games related by the feature of matching cards of the same rank or sequence and same suit. The basic goal in any form of rummy is to build &quot;melds&quot; which can be either sets (three or four of a kind of the same rank) or runs (three or more sequential cards of the same suit) and either be first to go out or to amass more points than the opposition.

==Origin==
There are two common theories about the origin of rummy, attributing its origins in either Mexico or China in the nineteenth century. The first is that it originated in Mexico around the 1890s in a game described as Conquian in R.F. Foster&#x27;s book &quot;Foster&#x27;s Complete Hoyle&quot;, which was played with a 40 card Spanish deck and had melding mechanics. The second is that Rummy originated in Asia, and that Rummy was the result of a Mahjong variant named Kun P&#x27;ai that was Westernized as Khanhoo by W.H. Wilkinson in 1891. 

Games scholar David Parlett combines these two theories, and proposes that the Mexican game of Conquian, first attested in 1852, is ancestral to all rummy games, and that Conquian is the equivalent of the Chinese game Khanhoo. The rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century, and perhaps as early as the 18th century.

Rummy variations like Gin and Canasta became popular in the twentieth century. Rummy games are popular in India, and it is likely that Indian rummy is an extension of gin rummy and 500 rum, which originated from the United States.

Several theories about the origin of the name &quot;rummy&quot; exist. Some attribute it to the British slang word &quot;rum&quot;, meaning odd, strange, or queer. Others say the origin lies in the game Rum Poker, or in the popular liquor of the same name.

==General features of rummy-style games==

===Deal===
Depending on the variation, each player receives a certain number of cards from either a standard deck of 52 cards, more than one deck or a special deck of cards used for specific games. The un-dealt cards are placed in a face down stack in the middle, which is known as the stock. In most variations, a single card is turned face up next to the stock where players discard or shed cards, and this is known as the discard pile. In 10 Cards Rummy, which is often played with two, three or four players, each player gets ten cards. In rummy games with five players, each player is given six cards. In 500 Rummy, each player is given seven cards. In Indian Rummy, 13 cards are dealt to each player.

===Melds===
A meld can either be a set (also known as a book) or a run. A set consists of at least three cards of the same rank, for example or . A run consists of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit or . Very few variations allow runs that have mixed suits. In a few variations of rummy, other patterns may be allowed. In some variations the melds (sets and runs) must be 3 or 4 cards, while other variations allow larger melds through the use of longer runs, for example: or, if multiple decks or wild cards are used, or . Wild cards (such as a joker) may be used to represent any card in a meld. The number of wild cards in a meld may be restricted.

=== Play ===
Depending on the variation of the game, players take turns adding and shedding cards from their hands. There are numerous and quite different ways of doing this though it usually involves picking a card from the stock and discarding a card to the discard pile. In some variations melds are revealed to all players by placing them face up on the table, in other variations players keep their hands hidden until the show. Some variations permit picking up the entire discard pile. A few variations permit stealing cards from their opponents melds.

===Show===
In most variations players must put all their cards into at least two melds (though they may be allowed to shed one card to the discard pile before showing). A player who has melded all cards reveals those still held and submits them for validation. All other players reveal their melds and deadweight. The action of submitting the cards is called Showing.

===Scoring===
After a successful show, the winner or all players score their hands. In most variations numbered cards have certain assigned points and the royal cards (J-Q-K) have assigned points and the A often has a different point value. Scoring often involves each player adding up points in their melded cards (sets and runs) and deducting points from cards that have not been melded. The winner may also receive a bonus for winning. Some special or difficult melds may also give extra points to a hand. A player may have a negative score if unmelded cards total more than melded ones. Usually play continues until one player passes a threshold, for example 1,000 points.

== Basic rummy ==
There are many variations of Rummy, but most build on a common set of features found in the basic game, called Basic Rummy or Straight Rummy. The following rules follow Parlett (2008) unless otherwise stated.

=== Cards ===
Standard packs of 52 cards are used: one is sufficient for two or three players; four to seven may use a twin pack, which may have two different patterns on the card backs. Alternatively four to six players may play with a single pack, but with a reduced number of cards. Recently, double packs of 104 German-suited cards have been produced for the first time in centuries. Jokers are wild.

=== Deal ===

The first dealer may be chosen by lot. Deal and play are clockwise. The dealer shuffles the pack well and player on the dealer&#x27;s right may cut. Up to seven may play and receive 10 cards each, provided there are two packs available if four or more play. The cards dealt are summarised in the table below:
Starting with eldest hand, cards are dealt clockwise, face down, one at a time. The dealer then turns the next card to start the discard pile and places the rest of the pack, face down, between the players as the stock.

=== Play ===
Play begins with the player on the dealer&#x27;s left and proceeds clockwise. In turn, each player draws the top card from the stock or the discard pile. If drawing from the discard pile a player may draw multiple cards. The player will then do either or both of the following:

* Meld. A player who has three cards of the same suit in a sequence or run, may meld them by laying these cards, face up, on the table. If at least three cards of the same rank are held, they may be melded as a set or group. The original rule was that Aces could only be played low, for example . However, it is now common to treat them as high or low, but not both. For example, is legal but is not. Melding is optional and as many may be made as are possible on one turn.

* Lay off. A player may also choose to lay off some cards on an existing meld. This means that a player may add to a sequence or a set on the table, regardless of who initially melded it.

Finally, after making any melds or lay offs, the player must discard a single card to the discard pile, face up. A player who drew the upcard from the discard pile, may not replace the same card on the discard pile, but must discard a different card.

If the stock runs out, the next player may choose to draw from the discard pile or to turn it over to form a new stock. The discard pile is not shuffled. After forming the new stock, the top card is drawn to form the new discard pile. The player can call rummy if a point is discarded into the discard pile. 

Going out. A player may go out by discarding the last remaining card in hand, whether as part of a meld, a lay-off or a discard. If a point that is playable is discarded in attempt to &quot;go out&quot; said discard would be &quot;rummy&quot;. Although when a persons last card is put down the game is IMMEDIATELY over regardless of what said card could play as.

NOTE: Some players require that the final card in a player&#x27;s hand be discarded. That is, a player cannot go out by melding or laying off, but must discard the final card. 

&quot;Example&quot;. Anne has left in her hand and draws , thus forming a sequence. She goes out by melding her sequence and without making a discard. Or supposing Ben has and draws the , he may meld the , discard the and go out. Or if there is a run of on the table and Charlotte, who has the , picks up the , she may lay off her two cards to the existing meld and go out.

=== Scoring ===
The player who goes out, wins, and scores as many points as the other have in their hand cards. Court cards score 10 each, Jokers 15 each and numerals score their face value. Aces count as 1 unless they are allowed to be high, in which case they score 11.

== Variations ==

In some instances, jokers are used as wildcards and can represent any card value when melding. They can be used in sets or runs but cannot be replaced when &#x27;melded&#x27;, nor can a player lay off a card to replace it by themselves or their opponent. Jokers are not counted during the scoring.

In other variations, such as rummy 500 and treppenrommé, discards are placed so that all the cards are visible. At the beginning of the turn, a player may take any card from the discard pile, so long as all the cards on top of it are also picked up, and the last card picked up is played immediately. If only picking up the top card, the player must keep it and discard a different card.

In a variation called &quot;block or tile rummy&quot;, players do not continue after going through the pack once – if no players are out, they all lose the points in their hands after the pack has been gone through once. &quot;Round the corner rummy&quot;, also called &quot;continuity rummy&quot;, is a variant where an ace may be simultaneously high and low to &quot;wrap around&quot; in a run, as in the following meld: Q-K-A-2.

==Related games==
There are a large number of games derived from rummy. Although in North America the word &quot;rummy&quot; is often used interchangeably for gin rummy, the term is applicable to a large family of games, including canasta, mahjong and rummikub.

===Melding family===

The most basic form where play continues until the stock is exhausted or a player achieves a specific number of points. Different cards (and melds in some games) are worth specific points. In some variations, the first meld must meet minimum point requirements or the final meld must include a discard. Some of these are played for four players in partnerships of two. In most variations, players may extensively add to or even rearrange their cards.

*Red three rummy
*Panguingue
*Penang rummy
*Scala 40
*Seven bridge
*Shanghai rum
*Speed Rummy
*Three thirteen
*Tong-its
*Treppenrommé
===Contract family===
In contract rummy, players are either assigned specific objectives (known or unknown to the other players) or decide their own objectives and announces them before play begins. Players are awarded and or penalized extra points depending on if they successfully meet their objectives.

*Kalooki
*Dummy rummy
*Carioca

*Liverpool rummy
*Zioncheck
===Shedding games===

In these games, players play until they have a minimal number of points or cards in their unmelded hands.
*Conquian
*Robbers&#x27; rummy
===Canasta family===

Canasta games usually involve partnerships using two or more decks with many wild cards. There are many rules and restrictions on first melds, final melds and taking the deck. Seven or eight of a kinds (canasta) score high.
*Buraco
*Biriba
*Canasta
*Hand &amp; Foot
*Samba
*Mille
===Knock rummy===
In knock rummy, players usually reveal their entire hand at the end of the game. In most variations, a player may signal (through knock or a specific kind of discard) that they have a valid hand. In some variations, the other players get one final turn before the reveal.
*Gin rummy
*Indian Rummy
*Rumino
*Tonk (aka Tunk)
*Viennese Rummy
==Variations with non-Western cards or special equipment==

===Rummoli games===

Rummoli games use Western cards, but require a special board or modified table with various squares with specific cards drawn on them. In each round, players put tokens in the squares. If a player lays down a card matching a square, they collect the tokens therein. Most versions allow multiple players to meld straights in sequence and do not use three- or four-of-a-kinds. Some versions include poker-like elements.
*Pope Joan
*Michigan
*Poch
*Rummoli 
*Three In One
*Tripoli or TRIPOLEY (a trademarked version)
*Michigan Rummy
*Royal Rummy
===Unique cards===

Several companies produce special card sets which often include special cards not seen in other rummoli variations. Some variations resemble the card game Crazy Eights. Most of these games are suitable for children and Safari Pals is an educational game.
*Phase 10
*Ruckus
*Safari Pals
===Chinese cards===

There are two different kinds of Chinese decks used for rummy-like games. The rules of each variation vary greatly.
*Khanhoo
*Quan dui
*Four Color Cards
===Tiles===

Tile rummy games usually include tiles of only three suits along with special tiles unseen in card games. Mahjong, a game with elaborate rules and different scoring systems, is played in East Asia with numerous variations played in different countries. &quot;Rummikub&quot; and other international tile variations have rules similar to meld and knock rummy.

<doc id="1183880" wikidata="Q1231858" url="?curid=1183880" title="Acts of Peter">
<text>The Acts of Peter is one of the earliest of the apocryphal Acts of the Apostles in Christianity, dating to the late 2nd century AD. The majority of the text has survived only in the Latin translation of the Codex Vercellensis, under the title  (&quot;Act of Peter with Simon&quot;). It is notable for a description of a miracle contest between Saint Peter and Simon Magus, the first record of the tradition that Saint Peter was crucified head-down, and as the origin of the saying &quot;Quo vadis?&quot;

==Dating and history==
The Acts of Peter were originally composed in Koine Greek during the second half of the 2nd century, probably in Asia Minor. The style of the Acts&#x27; writing is quite similar to that of four other apocryphal Acts – Acts of Andrew, Acts of John, Acts of Paul, and Acts of Thomas. For this reason, all five of these works were traditionally attributed to a single author; Photios I () identified this author as Leucius Charinus. Epiphanius () had earlier identified Leucius as a companion of John the Apostle.

The Manicheans are believed to have collected these five apocryphals Acts into a single corpus by the end of the 4th century. The current consensus is that the five works are interrelated, but were written by five separate authors, none of whom include Leucius. Despite this, the works are still frequently referred to as the &quot;Manichean Acts of Leucius Charinus&quot;, or simply the &quot;Leucian Acts&quot;.

The earliest extant manuscript of the Acts of Peter is a Late Latin translation contained in the Codex Vercellensis, which is believed to be the earliest manuscript of the . This codex is preserved in the Capitulary Library of the Vercelli Cathedral. The chapters describing Peter&#x27;s crucifixion (XXXIII–XLI) are preserved separately as &#x27;Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Peter&#x27; in various manuscripts in Latin, Greek, Coptic, Slavonic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Arabic.

It has been proposed that the martyrdom account was an earlier, separate text to which the preceding chapters were affixed.

==Content==

In the text, Peter performs many miracles, such as healing a crippled beggar. Peter preaches that Simon Magus is performing magic in order to convert followers through deception. Outraged, Peter challenges Simon to a contest, in order to prove whose works are from a divine source and whose are merely trickery. In the contest, Simon takes flight, and in retaliation, Peter strikes him down with the power of God, praying that Simon not be killed but badly injured. Simon is then taken to Terracina to one Castor &quot;And there he was sorely cut (Lat.[in Latin] by two physicians), and so Simon the angel of Satan came to his end.&quot;

Peter&#x27;s confrontation with Simon Magus has some resemblance to the Prophet Elijah&#x27;s confrontation with the Priests of Baal, as depicted in the Old Testament&#x27;s Book of Kings – a text with which the writer of the Acts of Peter was likely familiar.

Following this incident, Peter plans to flee the city; however, he sees an apparition of Jesus, and takes it as a message that he must stay and be crucified to see Jesus again in Heaven (see &quot;Quo vadis?&quot;).

Peter preaches to Agrippa&#x27;s concubines that they should practise abstinence and chastity. The enraged Agrippa orders Peter to be crucified; Peter requests to be crucified upside-down.

==The inverted crucifixion of Peter==
No canonical text refers to the death of Saint Peter. Apart from the Acts of Peter, the earliest attestation that Saint Peter was executed by crucifixion is found in , a treatise composed by Tertullian in the first decade of the 3rd century.

Sometime in the middle of the 3rd century, Origen of Alexandria popularized the tradition that Peter requested to be crucified upside-down. At the end of the 4th century, Jerome wrote in his (&quot;On Illustrious Men&quot;) that the reason for this request was that Peter felt he was unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.

However, in the Acts of Peter, the author writes that Peter&#x27;s request to be crucified upside-down was to make a point: that the values of those crucifying him were inverted themselves, emphasising the need to look beyond these values and adopt those of Jesus.

<text>Condorcet is a lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, to the southeast of the Mare Crisium. It was named after French mathematician Marquis de Condorcet. To the northeast of Condorcet are the craters Hansen and Alhazen.

The outer rim of Condorcet is eroded, with a low saddle point along the northern wall and the satellite crater Condorcet Y lies across the northwestern rim. The interior floor has been resurfaced, leaving a level, nearly featureless surface that is marked only by a few tiny craterlets. The floor has a large dark patch in the western half, but the remainder is approximately the same albedo as the surrounding terrain.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Condorcet.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Condorcet K — &quot;See&quot; Wildt (crater).

<doc id="1183886" wikidata="Q2938930" url="?curid=1183886" title="Blewbury">
<text>Blewbury is a village and civil parish at the foot of the Berkshire Downs section of the North Wessex Downs about south of Didcot, south of Oxford and west of London. It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 1,581. A number of springs rise at the foot of the escarpment of the downs. Some springs feed a small lake called the Watercress Beds, where watercress used to be grown. From here and elsewhere tributaries feed the Mill Brook which carries the water to the river Thames at Wallingford. The A417 road runs along below the escarpment above the springs and through the south of the village. The Blewbury citizens are often called Blewbarians.

==Prehistory==
The southern part of the parish is chalk downland and includes a number of prehistoric sites. The Ridgeway is an ancient trackway that passes just south of the parish. Half of the high Blewburton Hill is in the parish. It is topped by an Iron Age hill fort that may have been occupied from the 4th century BC to the 1st century BC. The parish&#x27;s highest point is the Churn Hill, southwest of the village. On its northwestern side are two round barrows, the larger of which is Churn Knob. There are other round barrows further south, towards the boundaries with Compton and East Ilsley parishes. During the Roman occupation, a shrine or temple was built near the Ridgeway on Lowbury Hill. A 7th century Anglo-Saxon burial mound, containing a sword and hanging bowl (which were relocated to The Oxfordshire Museum), can be found near to the Roman shrine or temple.

==Manors==
The parish was historically divided into three manors. The Great Manor was held by the Crown until the 17th century. The Prebendal Manor was held by the Church. Nottingham Fee was bought by a long-established local family, the Humfreys, in about 1652. They retained some of it including the manor house Hall Barn until recent times.

==Parish church==
The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Michael the Archangel are the early Norman 11th-century nave and sanctuary. At least two Norman windows survive. St Michael&#x27;s was transformed in the late Norman period in about 1190, when the transepts and present chancel were built to make it a cruciform church. At the crossing a central tower was built, and of this only the columns and vault survive. The south aisle was added in the 13th century, linked with the nave by a five-bay arcade in which the two western arches are taller than the other three. In the 14th century the north aisle were added with its two-bay arcade of octagonal columns, and the Lady chapel south of the chancel.

The west tower was also added in the 15th century. This may be when the central tower was dismantled, leaving only the columns and vault visible inside the church. Also from the 15th-century, are the choir stalls, the screen between the chancel and Lady chapel, the baptismal font and a doorway to a former rood loft. Inside St Michael&#x27;s are several monumental brasses, most of which are late Medieval. One is of a priest, John Balam, who died in 1496. A triple brass from about 1500 depicts a knight and his two successive wives. Another represents Sir John Daunce, who died in 1545, with his wife who died in 1523 and their children. Another depicts John Latton, who died in 1548. Unusually there is also a 19th-century brass: an image of Faith in memory of John Macdonald, a boy who died aged 13 in 1841. In about 1875 the north porch was rebuilt and the nave was re-roofed. The church is a Grade I listed building.

The west tower has a ring of eight bells. Joseph Carter of Reading cast the sixth bell in 1586. As well as his name and the year, the bell bears the legend &quot;Blessed be the name of the Lorde&quot;. Henry II Knight, also of Reading, cast the third bell in 1663. His successor Samuel Knight cast the fourth bell in 1689 and the fifth bell in 1704. Edward Read of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast the seventh bell in 1752. John Hunt, who briefly ran a bell-foundry at Cholsey, cast the tenor bell in 1825. These may have completed a ring of six bells, until John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast the present treble and second bells in 1906. St Michael&#x27;s also has a Sanctus bell that Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast in 1819. St Michael&#x27;s parish is part of the Churn Benefice.

==Economic and social history==
In 634, St Birinus was sent from Rome to convert the Midlands. Tradition has it that he preached to the local tribe from Churn Knob. He converted the tribe and was allowed to found Dorchester Abbey in Dorchester-on-Thames. An annual pilgrimage now walks from Churn Knob to Dorchester in celebration. Blewbury is called &quot;this venerable village&quot; in its Saxon charter. There is more information in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time the population was probably about 400, and there were four water mills. Two mills remain. In the English Civil War in the 17th century Blewbury was in no man&#x27;s land between King Charles I in Oxford and the Parliamentarian forces. On a day in 1644, following the Second battle of Newbury a troop of Royalist cavalry arrived at Hall Barn and demanded lunch. They had just been satisfied and left when a troop of Parliamentarians arrived with the same request, and were served at the same tables.
The East Field would have been open farmed, and tracks up to the downs have been deeply cut into the chalk by the frequent passage of animals. One of these tracks is still called Cow Lane. The chalk pit above the village was used to quarry chalk stone, which can be seen in houses and walls to this day. The inclosure act for the parish, the (43 Geo. 3. c. &quot;34&quot; ) resulted in an inclosure award in 1805 which records details of the parish at that time. The Local History Society has a register of registered births and deaths in the Parish. The governance of the village fell to a number of major farming families who intermarried. They included the Humfreys, the Robinsons, and the Corderoys. There were also the variety of local tradesmen. 

The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway was built past the village in 1882. The nearest station was called but was at Upton, away. British Railways closed the line in 1964. Around the end of the 19th century, the open areas of the downs were used for military manœuvres each summer, the camp being victualled by the local farmers. A firing range was also introduced, and was used intermittently until the 1970s. Since the 1950s Blewbury has become an attractive place for people commuting to work in the area, or even in London. The old cottages have been improved and extended, and a number of estates have been built. Until about 1970 there were several racing stables in the village; one is still in business a mile to the south, and several racehorse gallops on the Downs to the south of Blewbury are still in use.

==Secular buildings==
Blewbury has a number of historic timber-framed buildings. There is a cruck cottage in South Street. Hall Barn may date from about 1660. William Malthus was a London merchant who left land at Noke, Oxfordshire to fund a school at Blewbury. Its five-bay Queen Anne style school building close to St Michael&#x27;s church was built in 1709. Also near St Michael&#x27;s church are two almshouses. Nikolaus Pevsner states that the first was built in 1738 for the oldest man in the village and the second was added on its centenary in 1838. However, Page and Ditchfield state that there are two cottages that one James Bacon founded in 1747. Blewbury Mill (near to East Hagbourne) on Mill Brook is said to be where blotting paper was accidentally invented. Turnpike House in the village was a toll house on the Wantage to Streatley turnpike.

==Transport==
Thames Travel route 94 serves Blewbury from Mondays to Fridays, linking the village with Didcot town and with Didcot Parkway railway station. Buses run mostly once an hour, with a half-hourly service in the evening peak. There is no Saturday or Sunday service.

==Notable people==
In the 20th century the village attracted a number of notable artists and writers. Writers have included Elizabeth Ferrars, Dick Francis (from 1954 to 1980), Kenneth Grahame, Marguerite Steen, GB Stern, Barbara Euphan Todd and Ben Fergusson. Artists have included William Nicholson, father of abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Susan Beatrice &quot;Twissie&quot; Pearse, illustrator of children&#x27;s books, including Amelia Anne series, H Davis Richter known for much-reproduced interiors and Eli Marsden Wilson. The tradition continues, and keen amateur artists receive direction from the professional artists Roy East and Ron Freeborn. The village used to have an art gallery devoted to the work of local artists.

==Performing arts==
Every two years or so, the village puts on a festival with various shows, dances, and exhibitions in many of the old houses as well as a walk along the path of the Millbrook as it threads its way through many private gardens. The village has a theatrical tradition. There is an open-air theatre in the grounds of Orchard Dene house with capacity for an audience of 250, where productions are performed each summer. These involve amateur actors and back stage workers under professional direction. There are also theatrical events put on in the Village Hall.

About every five years since 1978, the village has commissioned a new opera for amateur performance. This has been performed in St Michael&#x27;s church. The earlier operas attracted media attention, including a one-hour television film about &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; in 1982. More recent productions have had less attention. The productions were not widely seen, since once St Michael&#x27;s has been adapted for the large cast and orchestra, there is room for only about 120 in the audience each night. In April 2009, there was a new production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot;. In 2012 or so, it was planned to revive the first of Blewbury&#x27;s commissioned operas &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; by the composer Richard Blackford, who now lives in the village.

<doc id="1183889" wikidata="Q187848" url="?curid=1183889" title="Interpacket gap">
<text>In computer networking, the interpacket gap (IPG), also known as interframe spacing, or interframe gap (IFG), is a pause which may be required between network packets or network frames. Depending on the physical layer protocol or encoding used, the pause may be necessary to allow for receiver clock recovery, permitting the receiver to prepare for another packet (e.g. powering up from a low-power state) or another purpose. It may be considered as a specific case of a guard interval.

==Ethernet==
Ethernet devices must allow a minimum idle period between transmission of Ethernet packets. A brief recovery time between packets allows devices to prepare for reception of the next packet. While some physical layer variants literally transmit nothing during the idle period, most modern ones continue to transmit an idle pattern signal. The standard minimum interpacket gap for transmission is 96 bit times (the time it takes to transmit 96 bits of data on the medium). The time is measured from the end of the frame check sequence of one frame to the start of the preamble for the next.

During data reception, some interpacket gaps may be smaller due to variable network delays, clock tolerances (all speeds), and the presence of repeaters (10 Mbit/s only).

Some manufacturers design adapters transmitting with a smaller interpacket gap for slightly higher data transfer rates. That can lead to data loss when mixed with standard adaptors.

==Fibre Channel==
For Fibre Channel, there is a sequence of primitives between successive frames, sometimes called &quot;interframe gap&quot; as well. The minimum sequence consists of six primitives, codice_1. Each primitive consists of four channel words of 10 bits each for 8b/10b encoded variants (1–8 Gbit/s), equivalent to four data bytes.

<doc id="1183890" wikidata="Q603956" url="?curid=1183890" title="Ben Lawers">
<text>Ben Lawers () is the highest mountain in the Breadalbane region of the Scottish Highlands. It lies north of Loch Tay and is the highest peak of the &#x27;Ben Lawers group&#x27;, a ridge that includes six other Munros: Beinn Ghlas, Meall Garbh, Meall Corranaich, An Stùc, Meall Greigh and Meall a&#x27; Choire Leith. It is also the highest peak in Perthshire, and the tenth highest Munro in Scotland. Ben Lawers was long thought to be over in height, but accurate measurement in the 1870s showed it to be only . It is formed of metamorphic rock, most notably calcareous mica-schists, and lower down, schistose grits.

Ben Lawers lies on the watershed between the rivers Tay and Lyon. Since the 1950s, water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme. The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige, from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay. The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344-metre-long Lawers Dam, a buttress-type dam that is 42 m high. 

Due to its high elevation and underlying geology, Ben Lawers is home to an exceptionally rich selection of arctic-alpine plant species and habitats. Since 1964, it has been designated as a National Nature Reserve (NNR).

==History==
There is much evidence of former settlements and other human activity on the southern slopes of Ben Lawers above Loch Tay. The fertile limestone and schist soils on these southern slopes have been farmed since very early times and there are many Bronze Age remains. The discovery of many boulders with cup and ring marks led Derek Alexander, an archaeologist for the National Trust for Scotland, to note that the Ben Lawers was likely to have been &quot;a very significant landscape in prehistory.&quot;

Overgrown tracks climb up the mountain from the valley to the peat beds and sheilings on the hillside, and there are ruins of cottages each surrounded by a small group of trees. These, along with the remains of ridged pastures, are signs of early cultivation. This evidence of habitation, and the presence of huts associated with transhumance at high elevation, demonstrate that local people are likely to have visited most if not all of the summits of the Ben Lawers range whilst grazing animals at height during the summer. The mapmaker Timothy Pont visited the area 1590s, and writer Ian R. Mitchell considers that Pont&#x27;s surveys show that he, or one of his associates, is likely to have climbed Ben Lawers, and should therefore be credited with earliest recorded ascent. Otherwise, the earliest recorded ascent was by members of a party organised by military surveyor William Roy: although it is not certain that Roy himself climbed the peak, his writings show that measurements were taken from the summit of Ben Lawers on 17 September 1776.

In 1878, a group of twenty men led by Malcolm Ferguson spent a day building a cairn nearly in diameter in the hope of bringing the summit above the &quot;magic&quot; figure of . The cairn, which was topped with a massive block of white quartz is no longer there; in any case the Ordnance Survey ignored it as an artificial structure that was not truly part of the hill.

==Ownership==
Prior to the 14th century, the mountain stood on the lands of Clan MacMillan. Chalmers of Lawers obtained the land by force from the clan in the mid-14th century in the reign of David II. The land was confiscated from the Chalmers family in 1473 by James III and given to Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy after Thomas Chalmers was implicated in the murder of James I. The lands have mainly remained in the ownership of the Campbells of Glenorchy and Breadalbane up to the present day, with some notable exceptions. Many of the farms were sold off in the late 1940s.

Most of the south side of the Ben Lawers range has since 1950 been owned by the National Trust for Scotland, and was purchased through the generosity of Percy Unna, a mountaineer and one time president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club. The area of land under trust ownership was extended in 1996 by the purchase of the neighbouring Tarmachan range. The trust built a visitor centre at the western end of the range that had an exhibition explaining the geological formation of the mountain, but this was closed and demolished in 2010. A new car park has been built on the opposite side of the road, from where a path leads to the summit of Ben Lawers by way of the intermediate peak of Beinn Ghlas. There is a nature trail on the lower section of this path, with information leaflets available in the car park.

The northern side of the Ben Lawers range comprises three privately owned estates, at Roroyere, Roromore, and South Chesthill. All three cover land extending from Glen Lyon to the watershed of the ridge. As with all land in Scotland, there is a freedom to roam on the hills regardless of whether the land is in public or private ownership, provided that access is exercised responsibly, in accordance with the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.

==Nature and conservation==

Ben Lawers is regarded by botanists as one of the richest areas for alpine flora in the UK, due to the schist rocks of the mountain which are situated at the correct elevation for the plants. The rocks supply an adequate amount of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and iron to the plants and breaks down to a clayish soil which retains moisture. Some of the plants found on Lawers include alpine forget-me-not, roseroot, net-leaved willow and most of the saxifrages. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported on 15 February 2021 that efforts are being made on Lawers to save the rare flower &quot;Sabulina rubella,&quot; also known as Mountain Sandwort, from extinction.

The mountain is also of interest to zoologists. Some of the bird species include ravens, ring ouzels, red grouse, ptarmigan, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, dotterel, golden plover, and short-eared owls. Other rare species include the viviparous lizard and the wildcat.

Ben Lawers is internationally significant for its lichen flora, with over 430 species recorded from its high ground. The mountain&#x27;s combination of calcareous mica-schist geology, severe climate, and extensive summit cliffs creates ideal conditions for arctic–alpine lichens, particularly in the summit cliffs and Lochan nan Cat corrie areas. The site has yielded several species previously unknown in the British Isles and is considered one of the most important locations for alpine lichens in Britain.

The Ben Lawers range has been designated as a National Nature Reserve (NNR) since 1964. In 2005 the boundary was altered so that all NTS land at Ben Lawers (including the neighbouring Tarmachan range) was included in the NNR, which the trust now manages on behalf of NatureScot. Ben Lawers is also designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Ben Lawers National Nature Reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The Ben Lawers range forms part of the Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon National Scenic Area, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development by restricting certain forms of development.

==Climbing==
Ben Lawers is a popular mountain, resulting in path erosion and vegetation loss from the number of visiting hillwalkers. Since the 1980s NTS, in partnership with other groups, have undertaken work on the path network in an attempt to control the impact of the high visitor numbers. The simplest route of ascent starts from the NTS carpark, following a path that reaches the summit via an intermediate peak, Beinn Ghlas. Alternative routes that avoid the erosion caused by the popularity of the main route usually start by following Lawers Burn, which meet the A827 at the village of Lawers. Heading north from this burn allows the walker to climb the peaks to the northeast of Ben Lawers on the way. The most direct route to the summit of Ben Lawers from Lawers is to continue along the Lawers Burn as far as the Lochan nan Cat (&quot;lochan of the cats&quot;), before heading straight to the summit by way of the east ridge.

<text>Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. Participants need to find a match for a word, picture, tile or card. For example, students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in random order. Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory.

== Examples ==
Type of game that may involve matching include:
* Dominoes
* Board games such as mahjong solitaire
* Card games such as Concentration or rummy
* Tile-matching video games

== Types of matching ==
Most matching games are objective, with correct answers in the rules for what counts as a match, pair, etc. Some however, like Dixit or Apples to Apples, are about subjective matches picked by one or more judge players. Here the correlation between a match holds value only as other players decide it, but rules dictate who will make those decisions and when.

== Matching card games ==
In card games of the matching group, players play cards in turn to a wastepile or tableau according to certain rules. A player unable to play a card by the rules is usually penalised by having to draw one or more extra cards, the aim usually being to shed all one&#x27;s cards. There are three main sub-groups of matching card games:

* Stops Group. Cards are played in ascending sequence, often in suit
* Eights Group. Cards are played to a single pile, matching the previous card in suit or rank.
* Layout Group. Cards are added to a tableau or layout or moved around it in accordance with the rules.

<doc id="1183903" wikidata="Q3116619" url="?curid=1183903" title="Griffintown">
<text>Griffintown is a historic neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, southwest of downtown. The area existed as a functional neighbourhood from the 1820s until the 1960s and was mainly populated by Irish immigrants and their descendants. Mostly depopulated since then, the neighbourhood has been undergoing redevelopment since the early 2010s.

Griffintown is the portion of the ward of St. Ann north of the Lachine Canal; the part south of the canal is now part of Pointe-Saint-Charles. This part of the ward was delimited by Notre-Dame Street to the north, the Bonaventure Expressway to the east, and a short segment of the city limit between Notre-Dame Street and the canal west of the St. Gabriel Locks to the west. It was the earliest and largest faubourg annexed to Old Montreal before the introduction of the tram car in the 1840s.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Griffintown&quot; was derived from Mary Griffin. Griffin illegally obtained the lease to the land from a business associate of Thomas McCord in 1799. She then commissioned land surveyor Louis Charland to subdivide the land and plan streets for the area in 1804. Griffin&#x27;s husband, Robert, owned a soap factory in the area and went on to become the first clerk of the Bank of Montreal upon its formation in 1817.

==History==

Griffintown was first populated in the early nineteenth century mostly by Irish immigrant labourers. They worked on the Lachine Canal and in the industries surrounding it, the Victoria Bridge, railways, and the Port of Montreal.

The Irish community was centered on St. Ann&#x27;s Catholic Church, which opened in 1854 at the corner of McCord (now Mountain Street) and Basin Streets, across from Gallery Square, which was named after the Gallery brothers, John Daniel Gallery, who ran a large and successful bakery and his brother Daniel Gallery who was an alderman of Montreal, Schools commissioner and a Liberal member of parliament.

By the early twentieth century, the Irish were being replaced by Jewish, Italian, Ukrainian, and Francophone communities, with the Irish becoming a minority group by 1941.

The Canadian National Railway elevated tracks approaching Montreal Central Station cut a wide swathe between Dalhousie and Nazareth Streets around 1930.

Post-war economic changes beginning in the 1950s led to the depopulation of &quot;The Griff&quot;. The Lachine Canal lost its role as a major transport artery when it was replaced by the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959.

In 1962, Griffintown was re-zoned as &quot;light industrial&quot;. Many buildings were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Bonaventure Expressway and for parking lots.

St. Ann&#x27;s Church was demolished in 1970, and is now the site of the Parc Griffintown-St-Ann, where parts of the church&#x27;s foundations remain visible, and park benches are positioned where the pews would have been. By 1974, the population of Griffintown was 546.

In 1990, the eastern part of the area was included in the planning sector of &quot;Faubourg des Récollets&quot;. By then it only somewhat resembled the historic neighbourhood due to the lack of remaining historical architecture. The Cité Multimédia was built partly above the ruins. The remainders are preserved in the McCord Museum. 

In 2014, Griffintown became part of an ongoing movement to introduce a &quot;Quartier de l&#x27;innovation&quot; to lower Montreal. This area would look to foster creativity and entrepreneurship in the city, designed to promote and encourage economic development for district residents.

==Redevelopment==

In October 2012, the city of Montreal revealed its plans concerning the redevelopment of the Griffintown area, with a desire to transform what was then an industrial, sparsely inhabited area into a pleasant, high-density neighborhood. In order to do this, the city announced plans to establish parks and bike paths and to provide permits for the building of dozens of condominium towers in the area, ranging from 10 to 20 stories high.

Another stated goal of the project was to preserve the historical significance of some of the remaining century-old buildings.

The Griffintown redevelopment is expected to be completed by 2025.

==Administrative status==
The entire area currently considered to be Griffintown is located within the borough of Le Sud-Ouest, although the western end of the historic district extends into the borough of Ville-Marie. Griffintown spans theoretically from the neighbourhood of Point St. Charles to the Old Port, and north to Notre-Dame Street. Currently, it holds the stables (the Griffintown Horse Palace, at the corner of Ottawa and Eleanor) for the horses that provide tours in carriages (calèche) around the Old Port. Many technological companies built office space in the area, and École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS) built its residence there. Very few residents still live in the area, and very little of the original architecture remains, however. Because of its location, some residential projects are taking shape, including Lowney Lofts, a multi-phase condominium project revitalizing a chocolate factory and the surrounding block.

In 2006, a project to move the Montreal Casino to the Peel Basin, as part of an entertainment complex in partnership with the Cirque du Soleil, caused a controversy because of the social impact of the establishment of gambling in an underprivileged district. The project was finally abandoned. In July 2007, promoter Devimco announced plans to develop 12 hectares of the neighborhood into a modern complex of office towers and residential homes.

On the City of Montreal Website, additional plans to update the now-renamed Griffintown are described.

==Culture==
Michel Régnier made a film on the subject in 1972, which used archival photos of Griffintown, along with interviews of former residents in order to paint a picture of the landscape, community, and a people.
Richard Burman made a documentary in 2003 called &#x27;Ghosts of Griffintown&#x27;. It starts off telling the story of Ms Mary Gallagher, a prostitute who was brutally murdered in 1879 and would return every seven years to William Street in search of her head. Although the last reported sighting was in 1928, Mary Gallagher Day is on June 27 (the date of the sightings), every seven years. It then explores the history using this story as a metaphor on how the community itself has disappeared like a ghost.
Alan Hustak has written a book &#x27;The Ghost of Griffintown&#x27; which explores in great detail the murder of Mary Gallagher.
Lisa Gasior created the Griffinsound Project that is a walking tour designed to be completed individually. It provides a background and interviews regarding the changing landscape of this space.

<doc id="1183904" wikidata="Q222793" url="?curid=1183904" title="2S19 Msta-S">
<text>The 2S19 Msta-S is a 152.4 mm self-propelled howitzer designed and manufactured by Uraltransmash in the Soviet Union and later in Russia, which entered service in 1989 as the successor to the 2S3 Akatsiya. The vehicle has the running gear of the T-80, but is powered by the T-72&#x27;s diesel engine.

==Development==
The Msta-S (also known by the GRAU index &quot;2S19&quot;) bears the Msta (, after the river Msta) howitzer, which was designed for deployment either on a self-propelled vehicle or as a towed gun. The 2S19 Msta-S is the armoured self-propelled howitzer, while the 2A65 Msta-B is a towed gun.

Development of the 2S19 started in 1980 under the project name &quot;Ferma&quot;. The prototype was known as Obiekt 316. The 2S19&#x27;s standard equipment consists of a semi-automatic laying system 1P22, an automatic loader, an NBC protection system, passive night-vision device for the driver, a vehicle snorkel, a dozer blade, a smoke generator and 81 mm smoke launchers, 1V116 intercom system and a 16 kW generator AP-18D. In 2008, the Russian Armed Forces ordered an improved model with an automated fire-control system.

Russia offered its Msta-S 152 mm howitzer to foreign countries, particularly in the Middle East. A demonstration was organised in 2020 by Rosoboronexport, the country&#x27;s nodal agency for arms export, for representatives from various Middle Eastern countries.

==Specifications==
Msta-S specifications provided by manufacturer
* Range:
** standard round
** base-bleed
** rocket-assisted
* Rate of fire: 6–8 rounds per minute
* Weapon elevation: −4° to +68°
* Weapon traverse: 360°
* Deployment time: 22 minutes
* Unit of fire: 50 rounds

==Variants==
* 1K17 Szhatie – a &quot;laser tank&quot; armed with a battery of lasers meant to disable optoelectronic systems; based on the Msta-S.
* 2S19M1 (unveiled in 2000, first deliveries in 2007) – Improved fire-control system and added GLONASS antenna. Modernised V-84AMS engine.
* 2S19M2 or 2S33 Msta-SM2 (2013) – Improved version currently in production equipped with a new automatic fire-control system which increases the rate of fire to 10 rounds per minute. Digital electronic maps are now available which significantly speeds up the terrain orientation in difficult geographical conditions and allows performing faster and more efficiently firing missions. The 2S33 Msta-SM2 howitzer is fitted with a new 2A79 152 mm/L60 ordnance that has improved ballistics. It can fire ammunition with more propellant charges and with a higher breech pressure than the original 2S19 Msta-S. The gun is longer and has a heavier barrel. As a result, it has a greater range of fire. Maximum range of fire with standard HE-FRAG shells is and with rocket-assisted shells.
* 2S19M1-155 (2006) – 155 mm export version of the 2S19M1, fitted with an L/52 gun with a range of more than . Modernised in 2020.
* 2S21 Msta-K – Wheeled variant, based on an eight-wheel truck chassis. It used the 2A67 gun, a variant of the 2A65 modified for use from wheeled platforms. There were several different prototypes, including one based on the Ural-5323 and one on the KrAZ-6316. The project was abandoned in 1987.
* 2S19M (also known as 2S30 Iset and 2S33 Msta-SM) – Project for a version with improved range and rate of fire, easier maintenance and optimised manufacturing process. Started between the 1990s and the early 2000s, but quickly abandoned in favour of the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV.
* 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV – Project for a new artillery system for the Russian Ground Forces (SV stands for &quot;sukhoputniye voyska&quot;). Early prototypes consisted of a 2S19 chassis with modified turret, fitted with an over-and-under dual autoloaded 152 mm howitzer. Development of this variant was abandoned in favour of an entirely new artillery system using the same designation.

==Operational use==
Msta-S howitzers were used by the Russian Ground Forces to deliver artillery strikes against Chechen separatists during the Second Chechen War.

Msta-S howitzers have been used in the Russo-Ukrainian War by the pro-Russian separatists who captured one machine during the conflict.

Both Msta-B and Msta-S were used by the Ukrainian Ground Forces in the Battle of Bakhmut.

, there is visual evidence of Russian forces losing 171 Msta-S (123 destroyed, 11 damaged, 2 abandoned and 35 captured) and 35 Msta-SM2 (17 destroyed, 2 damaged and 16 captured).

<text>Oppolzer is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern edge of Sinus Medii, along the meridian of the Moon. Its diameter is 41 km. It was named after the Austrian astronomer Theodor von Oppolzer. It is located within one crater diameter of the origin of the selenographic coordinate system at 0° N, 0° W. Attached to the surviving remnants of the southeast rim is the crater Réaumur. To the west-southwest is the lava-flooded walled plain Flammarion.

This formation consists of little more than an irregular arc of mounts along the south, and a ring of scattered ridges along the northern rim. There is a particularly wide gap in the rim to the northeast where no ridges survive to mark the crater perimeter. The interior floor has been resurfaced by basaltic lava.

A 110-km-long rille designated Rima Oppolzer passes through the southern part of the crater floor, and continues to the east and west of the crater.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Oppolzer.

<text>Vladimir Ilyich Tikhonov (; born 4 February 1947) is a Russian politician and has been a leading member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.

Tikhonov served as the manager of the Russian airline Aeroflot during the 1990s and helped to modernize it, whilst running it as a partnership between the government and the private sector. Despite some success Tikhonov was dismissed from his post on the advice of major shareholder Boris Berezovsky, one of the leading Russian oligarchs.

As a leading member of the Communist Party Tikhonov rose to the position of Chairman of the Central Committee, as well as becoming the governor of Ivanovo. Tikhonov clashed with long-standing party leader Gennady Zyuganov over who had control and as a result Zyuganov ensured that Tikhonov lost his Chairmanship. As a result, he set up his own party claiming the Communist Party name, and the two groups even held separate conferences in 2004. Zyuganov accused Tikhinov of being in league with the government although a ruling by the Justice Ministry in August 2004 declared that the party is not legitimate and refused to register it. The group briefly reorganised as the All-Russian Communist Party of the Future, although Tikhonov has since sought to return to Zyuganov&#x27;s group.

<text>Petit is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located on the northwestern edge of the Mare Spumans. The crater has a prominent ray system. The name is appropriate, since &quot;petite&quot; means small in French. But it was actually named in honor of Alexis Thérèse Petit, a French physicist.

The crater lies to the south of the crater Townley, and east of Condon. Farther to the northwest is Apollonius. Petit was previously designated Apollonius W before being given a name by the IAU in 1976.

<doc id="1183921" wikidata="Q5635175" url="?curid=1183921" title="HM Prison Fairlea">
<text>HM Prison Fairlea was an Australian female prison located on Yarra Bend Road in the suburb of Fairfield, Victoria, Australia. The first all-female prison in Victoria, it was built on the site of the Yarra Bend Asylum, with remnants of the walls and gates being used in the layout of the prison. In 1982 a deliberately lit fire led to the deaths of three inmates. The rebuilt and expanded prison reopened in 1986. After closing in 1996 due to privatisation of sections of the prison system, Fairlea was demolished and the site converted to parkland.

==Site==
In the 1950s, the Victorian Government committed to building the state&#x27;s first all-female prison. The site chosen on National Park Road (now Yarra Bend Road), Fairfield included the grounds and structures of the former Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum and Fairhaven Venereal Disease Clinic, many of which were converted for prison use. Prior to the opening of Fairlea, female prisoners had been held in a small section Pentridge Prison. Fairlea&#x27;s grounds and buildings were more spacious than those of the female unit at Pentridge; however many of the buildings were unsatisfactory, dating from the site&#x27;s time as an asylum in the 1860s.

==Notable inmates==
* The Fairlea Five Vietnam War protesters: Jean McLean, Joan Coxsedge, Irene Miller, Jo Maclaine-Cross and Chris Cathie 
* Heather ParkerOffice of Corrections worker who aided the escape of prisoners Peter Gibb and Archie Butterly in 1993.

==Incidents==
===Riot===
In January 1980 prisoners staged a riot in the mess hall where furniture and crockery were smashed and fittings ripped from kitchen walls. During the incident four prisoners took advantage of the diversion and climbed through smashed windows onto the roof. At 2.00 am prisoners set alight toilet paper in two bathrooms at either end of two adjoining dormitories. Prisoners from two dormitories were locked in the mess hall during the blaze. Firemen, prison officers and a few inmates soon controlled the fire.

===Dormitory fire===
A dormitory fire claimed the lives of three remand prisoners on the evening of Saturday 6 February 1982. Two of the women killed, Clelia Teresa Vigano and Mary Escola Catilo, were the respective partners and criminal associates of drug smuggler David McMillan and his associate Michael Sullivan. Two other remand prisoners were injured. A senior police officer said that the fire had been set at 8.15 pm and was &quot;a reaction&quot; to an escape earlier that day. That escape had occurred at 3.00 pm when four women forced a laundry door and scaled two fences; two women were quickly caught by prison officers near the prison grounds while two prisoners evaded capture.

At the subsequent coronial inquiry, two surviving prisoners reported that the third deceased prisoner, Danielle Wright, was angry that two of her friends had been promptly recaptured and placed in solitary confinement after their escape that afternoon. Wright wanted to tear up the building in protest, the witnesses stated, but Vigano suggested she should instead light a fire, reasoning that the buildings were very old and worthy of being condemned anyway. It was planned they would cause some damage with the fire, but then extinguish it. Torn up papers, bedding and mattresses were set fire at about 8.00 pm, and Wright threatened violence against any prisoner who pressed the buzzer to summon an officer. However the fire quickly got out of control and Wright sounded the buzzer. Ten minutes had elapsed before help arrived.

Coroner Kevin Mason criticised the lack of fire training carried out by the prison. He ruled that the three deceased all died of asphyxiation from carbon monoxide poisoning, and that Wright had lit the fire. The hearing heard that two prisoners were rescued by officer Roy Ansfield who crawled into the burning building to retrieve them. At the hearing it was suggested by the counsel for Vigano&#x27;s parents that the building&#x27;s wooden construction was unsuitable for its purpose as a locked dormitory; he called it &quot;a potential fire hazard and a death trap&quot;.

As a result of the fire, many of the inmates were temporarily housed at Pentridge Prison whilst Fairlea was rebuilt. The new complex was opened in 1986 and 3.7 million dollars was spent on the rebuilding, which allowed the prison to hold up to 106 women at a time. The old asylum and clinic structures were demolished and one of the 1860 gate pillars was relocated to a site opposite the original entry to Fairlea.

===Cell fire===

A deliberately lit cell fire caused $3,200 damage on 8 May 1988. An officer ordered three women prisoners from their cell after seeing smoke coming from under its door. They refused and he entered to find them kneeling by a broken window trying to get fresh air. By the time the chief prison officer arrived at 8.15 pm the fire was out. No one was killed or injured in the fire.

==Closure==
Within ten years of the rebuilding, a change of Government led to the demise of Fairlea. The new Liberal Government began the privatisation of the prison system and as a result private contractors won the right to administer the women&#x27;s prison system. A new privately run prison, the Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre was built at Deer Park and during the course of 1996 the inmates of Fairlea Prison were transferred across to the new facility. The Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre was returned to government control in 2000.

Fairlea Women&#x27;s Prison finally closed in August 1996, with the majority of structures demolished shortly thereafter. The basketball courts, Parks Victoria Office, and the adjacent building are the only structural remains of Fairlea, with the remaining grounds returned to parkland. Fairlea Road and the Fairlea East and Fairlea West ovals identify the former prison site. During its forty years of operation nearly 18,000 female inmates served time at Fairlea Women&#x27;s Prison. Fairlea is registered with Heritage Victoria and given the register number VHR H1552.

<text>Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre is a high security remand centre for males, primarily accommodating individuals who a judge or magistrate has ordered to be held in custody as they await, and during, trial. The centre is located on the Ipswich Motorway at Wacol in the south-western suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. It is the largest correctional centre in Queensland. The centre&#x27;s Maximum Security Unit was closed on 1 March 2013, with maximum security inmates moved to other maximum security facilities within the state.

The centre is relatively modern with televisions, showers and toilets in all rooms and shared dining facilities.

Managed by the Queensland Corrective Services the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre was the second of Queensland&#x27;s privately operated non-government prisons (previously managed by Geo Group), sharing the notation with the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre (previously managed by Serco). Both of which were announced to be transitioned to be managed by Queensland Corrective Services in 2019.

The facility is named after Arthur Gorrie.

In June 2018, the contract for the facility was up for tender.

In 2020, after more than 28 years, Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre transitioned from GEO Group services to Queensland Corrective Services.

==Violence and overcrowding==
In June 2018, a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation revealed widespread inmate violence, overcrowding and brutality by prison guards at Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre. The rate of prisoner assault in 2016 was more than twice that of the next most violent prison in the country.

<doc id="1183937" wikidata="Q7096988" url="?curid=1183937" title="Operation Dingo">
<text>Operation Dingo, or the Chimoio Massacre, was an attack by the Rhodesian Security Forces against the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) run camps at Chimoio and Tembue in Mozambique from 23 to 25 November 1977.

==Background==
Chimoio was a series of ZANLA-run refugee camps and, illegally, training facility, and a launchpad for insurgents infiltrating into Rhodesia. It was located at New Farm, known locally as Adriano&#x27;s Farm. The old farmhouse, and a number of related monuments and graves, are located some 18 kilometres north-northeast of Chimoio Municipality.() 

==The Chimoio Complex==
New Farm was a farm acquired by the Frelimo Government in 1975 from its Portuguese owner, known as &#x27;Adriano&#x27;. It was handed over by the Mozambican government to ZANLA, which made it their refugee centre (illegally) and subsequently a forward, military operating headquarters. It was home to military, political and other civilian occupants, and included a hospital, schools, and stores. The complex included:

* Adriano&#x27;s farm house, or the &#x27;White House&#x27;–Zanu Party HQ (residence of Josiah Tongogara and others of the general staff);
* Parirenyatwa camp hospital;
* Takawira Camp 1 for general military training;
* Takawira Camp 2 for engineering and anti-aircraft training (home to guerillas trained in China, Yugoslavia and Tanzania);
* Chitepo College of Ideology, for political indoctrination, propaganda, etc.;
* Chindunduma camp–a general school;
* Mbuya Nehanda A–a female military training camp;
* Mbuya Nehanda B–a gynaecology and obstetrics clinic;
* Pecy Ntini camp–a rehabilitation unit for disabled and wounded guerrillas;
* Chaminuka Camp–an internal security and intelligence unit doubling up as a prison;
* Zvede Zvevanhu camp–the military stores: ordnance, supply and vehicle pool, and the Mudzingadzi piggery;
* Pasichigare Camp–a camp for the accommodation of &#x27;in-house&#x27; ngangas, mediums, predictors of the future and traditional healers;
* Sekuru Kaguvi Camp–a care-home for pensioned cadres or their older relatives.

==The Attacks==
The intention of concentrated air and ground firepower was to exploit the concentration of inhabitants, both refugees and militants, on the parade ground for morning parade. On that occasion, the morning parade had been cancelled, making the cluster bomb strike on the parade ground assembly ineffective. As part of a deception plan, a Douglas DC-8 airliner was flown over the Chimoio camps 10 minutes before the airstrike; the inhabitants assumed a second false alarm, and did not disperse or try to take cover when the bombers subsequently approached. In order to strike as many ground targets as possible, six mothballed Vampire jets dating from the 1940s were brought back into use for the operation. 

At 0745 in the morning, directly after a strike by the Rhodesian Air Force&#x27;s aging Canberra and Hunter strike aircraft, the camps were attacked. 96 Rhodesian SAS, 48 Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) paratroopers, and an additional 40 helicopter-borne RLI troops took part. In the first pass, four Canberra bombers dropped 1200 Alpha bombs (Rhodesian-designed anti-personnel bombs) over an area long and wide.

Following the initial air strikes by the Canberras, Hunters and Vampire FB9&#x27;s, ten Alouette III helicopter gunships (&quot;K-Cars&quot; in the Fireforce tactical terminology) engaged opportunity targets in allocated areas that together inflicted the majority of the casualties, while two Vampire T11&#x27;s flew top cover. The paratroopers and heliborne troops were deployed on three sides of the objective into various stop groups and sweep lines, and were also effective in killing large numbers of fleeing ZANLA cadres. Nevertheless, the small size of the ground force and the lack of a complete envelopment allowed a number of fleeing ZANLA cadres to escape. Two important targets of the attack, ZANLA commanders Josiah Tongogara and Rex Nhongo escaped.

A &quot;stay-behind&quot; force of Rhodesian SAS remained in ambush positions around the area overnight, to wait for any ZANLA who might return; these SAS were then extracted by helicopter in the morning. The Rhodesian force withdrew, having lost one SAS member, Tpr. F.J. Nel, being shot and killed at Chimoio, and one Vampire pilot, Flt Lt Phillip Haigh, killed trying to crashland his jet in a field after his aircraft was damaged by ground fire. The pilot chose to attempt a forced landing rather than execute the dangerous act of bailing out of the Vampire which was not fitted with an ejection seat.

A similar attack was repeated two days later at Tembue. (). Though there was a Mozambique Liberation Front base nearby at Chimoio they did not interfere in the Rhodesian force&#x27;s activities.
==Aftermath==
According to the Rhodesian government at least between 1,200 and 3,000 ZANLA terrorists were killed in Operation Dingo. Most sources sympathetic to the ZANLA also put the death toll at over 1,000, adding that hundreds who were killed were actually civilians and not guerrillas. While two Rhodesian SAS soldiers died (one in the fighting and one by anti-aircraft fire on the return). 

Bishop Abel Muzorewa called a week of mourning for raids on both camps as they contain many civilian refugees. 
A new base was later built in the Chimoio area. The Rhodesians attacked it in 1978 under Operation Snoopy. &quot;Operation Dingo&quot; was to be followed by a further thirty cross-border raids before the end of the war.

==Legacy==
National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe opened a site museum at the farm house, and a memorial at the site in 2011. The positions of the fallen are marked by at least twelve mass graves which are clustered around the main New Farm complex.

<text>The Royal Engineers Museum, Library and Archive is a military engineering museum and library in Gillingham, Kent. It tells the story of the Corps of Royal Engineers and British military engineering in general.
==History==

The &#x27;Ravelin Building&#x27;, which was designed by Major E.C.S. Moore, Royal Engineers and was completed in 1905 at a cost £40,000, was originally used as electrical engineers&#x27; school before becoming the home of the museum in 1987. It was classed as Grade II listed on 5 December 1996. Its collection received &#x27;Designated&#x27; status in 1998 (it is recognised as having an outstanding collection of national and international significance). It is one of only three military or regimental museums in the country to hold this status.

==Collections==
The museum and library hold over 500,000 objects relating to the history of the Corps of Royal Engineers and the development of military engineering. It also has a collection of paintings and a large collection of medals including 25 Victoria Crosses. Other items include a German V-2 rocket used during the Second World War, the map used by the Duke of Wellington during the Battle of Waterloo, a finial from the Mahdi&#x27;s tomb, weapons used by Lieutenant John Chard during the Anglo-Zulu War, a collection of bridge-laying tanks, a Brennan torpedo and a Harrier jump jet.

<doc id="1183944" wikidata="Q966890" url="?curid=1183944" title="Ares Shrike 5.56">
<text>The Ares Defense Shrike 5.56 is an air-cooled, dual-feed light machine gun/rifle for semi or full-auto configurations that fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. The Shrike 5.56 is sold as either as a complete weapon, or as an upper receiver &quot;performance upgrade kit&quot; to existing AR-15 and M16-type service rifles and carbines. The name comes from the Shrike, a carnivorous passerine bird, and was designed by Geoffrey Herring.

==Overview==
The Shrike 5.56 has gas-piston operation, a quick-change barrel with fixed headspace and MIL-STD-1913 rail interface for the mounting of accessories. It can utilize standard 30-round STANAG magazines, 100-round Beta C-Mag drum magazines, and M27-linked SAW ammunition from 100-round or 200-round &quot;soft-pouches&quot; and 200-round hard plastic SAW ammunition containers. At 7.5 lbs complete weapon weight, the Shrike 5.56 is lighter than other comparable squad automatic weapons, such as the M249 light machine gun and Heckler &amp; Koch MG4. The design also appears to be also influenced by a multitude of weapons, including the Stoner 63. It features a short-stroke impinging gas piston system.

==Variants==
There exist some notable differences between the current model and the older prototypes.

;EXP-1: The initial proof-of-concept prototype. It features a modified M249 handguard, a unique firing mechanism and a quick-detach barrel latch derived from the Stoner 63.
;EXP-2: This improved prototype featured a new Picatinny rail handguard, an improved firing mechanism using some M16 components, and a new barrel latch similar to that of the M60 machine gun.
;03A: The production model. It has a compact side-mounted gas system different from the previous prototypes, and its firing mechanism is also significantly modified. Early production runs had a circular handguard. More recent production Shrikes have a Picatinny rail handguard. The barrel latch and some other components are similar to the EXP-1.
;ARES-16SPW receiver: This receiver was designed by Ares specifically for the Shrike system. It is identical to the mil-spec M16 receiver, except its magazine well is cut away to save space. Shrikes mounted on this receiver can only use M249 box magazines with linked munitions, but they have a smaller vertical profile.
;Ares AAR: Lightweight Infantry Automatic Rifle for squad support. Features quick-change barrel, telescoping stock, MIL-STD-1913 optics mount and rail interface handguard with USMC Grip-Pod system. Feeds from 30- and 100-round magazines and can be user-configured to dual-feed (belt and magazine) in minutes with optional belt-feed module.
;Ares AAR/C: Ultra-Compact Infantry Automatic Rifle for squad support. Features quick-change barrel, side-folding stock, MIL-STD-1913 optics mount and rail interface handguard. Feeds from 30- and 100-round magazines. Compact design maximizes portability and dismounted maneuverability. This production variant can be fitted with multiple Picatinny rails. These enable it to mount various commercial scopes, flashlights, lasers, and even secondary underbarrel weapons such as grenade launchers and shotguns.

<text>Respighi is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the southeast of the crater Dubyago, near the eastern limb of the Moon. To the east is the comparably sized Liouville.

This is a crudely circular crater with inner walls that slope down to the relatively darker (lower albedo) interior central floor. The rim has not suffered significant erosion from subsequent impacts, but there is a shallower section to the south. Attached to the southern rim of this crater is Schubert N, a formation that has the appearance of two or more merged craters with a dark, lava-flooded floor that is elongated to the southeast.

Apollo 11 was the spacecraft that took the image of Respighi.

The crater is named for Lorenzo Respighi, 1824–89, Italian mathematician and astronomer.

<doc id="1183956" wikidata="Q3357463" url="?curid=1183956" title="Jutland Dragoon Regiment">
<text>The Jutland Dragoon Regiment () is the only regiment of the Royal Danish Army that has an armored (MBT) battalion, and is one of the Danish combat regiments in which soldiers are entitled to wear the black beret of the Armoured corps.

==History==
The Regiment traces its roots back to the 3rd Dragoon Regiment formed in 1657, but did not become the Jutland Dragoon Regiment until 1932, with the amalgamation of the 3rd Dragoon Regiment in Århus and the 5th Dragoon regiment in Randers. The regimental fusion eventually necessitated a relocation to Holstebro in 1953, where the Dragoons have remained ever since.

The Regiment acquired international fame in recent time, when it served with UNPROFOR in Bosnia, where the Dragoons of Jutland assaulted Serb AT-3 Sagger positions in one of the largest skirmishes between UNPROFOR forces and military units involved in the war in Bosnia, and the largest Danish battle engagement since The Second Schleswig War of 1864. The battle, known as Operation Bøllebank, was later characterized by the commander at the time as the time when &quot;the mouse ate the cat&quot;.

On 19 July 2005 another traditional regiment, Prinsens Livregiment was merged with Jydske Dragonregiment, and personnel serving as Dragoons became entitled to bear the insignia of the Royal Danish Prince Consort, Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark

From the 1960s to 2004 the regiment had responsibility for three armoured battalions, one reconnaissance battalion and three motorized infantry battalions. The three armoured battalions were assigned to different brigades, the recce battalion and later (1992) one armoured battalion as independent battalions in Danish Division. From 1992−2004 the regiment also had to form three light reconnaissance squadrons assigned to three of the five brigades. With the three infantry battalions and regimental staff, in war time, the regiment could form a battlegroup, with combat support/artillery troops from other regiments.

The regiment has in recent time served on the frontline in Danish involvements in Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq.

The regiment&#x27;s tank battalion won the Top 120mm Fire Team category at the Ex Worthington 16 competition in 2016, held at CFB Gagetown in Canada.

The Regimental logo is inspired by the coat of arms of Denmark, and features a blue lion above nine red hearts, and the monogram C5, in reference to King Christian V who ordered the formation of the original 3rd Dragoon Regiment. The lion and its red hearts are also a symbol of Jutland and are featured on the stern of Fregatten Jylland.

==Structure==
The regiment today serves only in its armoured role as well as in an educational role for new conscripts, in a separate battalion.

<doc id="1183957" wikidata="Q7619913" url="?curid=1183957" title="Storage Resource Broker">
<text>Storage Resource Broker (SRB) is data grid management computer software used in computational science research projects. SRB is a logical distributed file system based on a client-server architecture which presents users with a single global logical namespace or file hierarchy. Essentially, the software enables a user to use a single mechanism to work with multiple data sources.

==Description==
SRB provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous computer data storage resources over a network. As part of this, it implements a logical namespace (distinct from physical file names) and maintains metadata on data-objects (files), users, groups, resources, collections, and other items in an SRB metadata catalog (MCAT) stored in a relational database management system. System and user-defined metadata can be queried to locate files based on attributes as well as by name. SRB runs on various versions of Unix, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

The SRB system is middleware in the sense that it is built on top of other major software packages (various storage systems, real-time data sources, a relational database management system, etc.) and it has callable library functions that can be utilized by higher level software. However, it is more complete than many middleware software systems as it implements a comprehensive distributed data management environment, including various end-user client applications. It has features to support the management and collaborative (and controlled) sharing, publication, replication, transfer, and preservation of distributed data collections.

SRB is sometimes used in conjunction with computational grid computing systems, such as Globus Alliance, and can utilize the Globus Alliance Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) authentication system.

SRB can store and retrieve data in archival storage systems such as the High Performance Storage System and SAM-FS, on disk file systems (Unix, Linux, or Windows), as binary large objects or tabular data in relational database management systems, and on tape libraries.

SRB was used since 1997. In 2008 the SRB was estimated to be managing over two petabytes of data.

While licensed, SRB source distributions are freely available to academic and non-profit organizations. Nirvana SRB, a commercial version of SRB, featured capabilities specifically adapted to government and commercial use.

==History==
SRB development began in 1995, through the cooperative efforts of General Atomics, the Data Intensive Cyber Environments Group (DICE), and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF).

SRB builds on the work of Reagan Moore. Moore, a doctorate in plasma physics from UCSD and former computational plasma physicist at General Atomics, joined the San Diego Supercomputer Center at its inception.
A project for a distributed object computation testbed was funded by DARPA and the US Patent and Trademark Office in 1998 and 1999.

In 2003, General Atomics was granted an exclusive license from UCSD to develop SRB for commercial applications.
New versions were announced in 2008 and 2012.

The integrated Rule-Oriented Data management System (iRODS) is a follow-on project of the SDSC SRB team (which became the Data Intensive Cyber Environments group), and largely replaced the use of SRB. iRODS is based on SRB concepts but was completely re-written, includes a highly-configurable rule engine at its core and is fully open source.
Conferences in 2011 included demonstrations of iRODS.

<text>HM Prison Tarrengower is a women&#x27;s prison located in Maldon, Victoria, Australia. It focuses on release preparation for the women, and provides them with programs and employment opportunities, also allowing them to build confidence and skill sets when it comes to gaining and maintaining employment both whilst in custody and also upon their release. 

It offers legal training to empower women to be involved in community organisations following their release. It also has facilities for pregnant women and for babies to stay with their mothers.

==History==
Originally a farm, the prison was opened in January 1988 after the property was purchased and accommodation units were built. Tarrengower is the only minimum security female prison in Victoria. It is situated 136 km to the north of Melbourne, 2.5 km from the Maldon township.

<text>Likoma Island is the larger of two islands in Lake Malawi, in East Africa, the smaller being the nearby Chizumulu. Likoma and Chizumulu both belong to Malawi, and together they make up the Likoma District. Although both islands lie just a few kilometres from Mozambique, and are entirely surrounded by Mozambican territorial waters, they are both exclaves of Malawi.

==Geography==
The island has an overall area of 18 km2, and is located in the north-eastern part of Lake Malawi, 7 km north-west of Cobue, Mozambique. The closest town on the Malawian coast is Chintheche.

==History==
In 1880 missionaries from the Universities&#x27; Mission to Central Africa, founded in response to a plea by David Livingstone, established their headquarters on Likoma Island. Due to the presence of British missionaries, the island was assigned to Malawi rather than Mozambique when national borders in East Africa were established after World War II.

Despite a high population density, the natural environment of Likoma island is largely unspoiled. The coast is varied, with rocky slopes, sandy bays and swamps. The interior of the island is mostly covered by grassland, with a large number of baobab trees (of the &quot;Adansonia digitata&quot; species) and mango trees. Fauna is mostly composed of small reptilians, amphibians, birds and a number of invertebrates, including scorpion spiders. On the coast, crocodiles are occasionally seen. The waters around Likoma, as is usual in Lake Malawi, host a number of cichlids; some species, such as &quot;Labidochromis caeruleus likomae&quot;, are endemic of the Likoma area.

==Population==
Likoma is densely populated, with about 10,500 inhabitants dispersed in a dozen settlements, the main being the eponymous town of Likoma; the nearby island of Chizumulu has a further 4,000 inhabitants. The most represented ethnic groups are the Nyanja people (60%) and the Tonga people (25%), followed by smaller groups of Tumbuka, Yao, and Chewa. Their main economic activity is fishing, although agriculture (mainly rice and cassava) is also represented. The town of Mbamba hosts a busy market. It is also the site of the Anglican Cathedral of St Peter, one of the largest churches in Africa.

As a consequence of poverty and insufficient hospitals, the situation of public health on the island is critical, although malaria (which is widespread in Malawi) has not been reported. In 2005-6, Likoma has been the subject of a scientific study on the epidemiology of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the minimal economic development of Likoma, there are several schools serving all settlements, and literacy is thus widespread.

==Infrastructures and transportation==
Likoma has no paved roads, and there are very few motor vehicles. Electricity is provided by a generator and a solar bank. This affords the island 24 hour electricity, with the exception of 1-5 minutes at around 10 pm, while they switch the power source. There is a small telephone network on the island, although telephones themselves are quite rare. Likoma Airport is a tarred airstrip found on the island and can be reached by plane from Lilongwe.

The island&#x27;s main mode of transportation is provided by the steamer boat that circumnavigates Lake Malawi, stopping over at all the main settlements on the coast and the islands. In addition, The links the island with the town of Nkhata Bay on the west side of the lake once a week. Smaller boats (including dhows) cross the strait between Likoma and Chizumulu, and also between Likoma and Cobue in Mozambique. Both goods and people are transported through these routes.

As Likoma is a relevant tourist destination in Malawi, there are a few hotels and backpacker hostels, usually based on ecotouristic principles. The waters around Likoma are appreciated for snorkelling and diving.

<text>Sabatier is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon, at the southwestern fringes of the Mare Marginis.

It lies in a relatively isolated area, with the nearest named crater being the walled plain Neper to the southeast. This is a nearly circular formation, with a low outer rim and a circular floor about half the crater&#x27;s diameter.

<text>Vanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). This evergreen genus occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa. Five species are known from the contiguous United States, all limited to southern Florida.

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (&quot;V. planifolia&quot;), native to Mexico and Belize, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor. The key constituent imparting its flavour is the phenolic aldehyde vanillin.

The genus was established in 1754 by Plumier, after J. Miller. The word &quot;vanilla&quot;, derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word &quot;vaina&quot; (&quot;vaina&quot; itself meaning sheath or pod), simply translates as little pod.

== Description ==

This genus of vine-like plants has a monopodial climbing habitus. They can form long thin stems with a length of more than 35 m, with alternate leaves spread along their length. The short, oblong, dark green leaves of &quot;Vanilla&quot; are thick and leathery, even fleshy in some species. But there are also a significant number of species that have their leaves reduced to scales or have become nearly or totally leafless and appear to use their green climbing stems for photosynthesis. Long and strong aerial roots grow from each node.

The racemose inflorescence&#x27;s short-lived flowers arise successively on short peduncles from the leaf axils or scales. There may be up to 100 flowers on a single raceme, but usually no less than 20. The flowers are quite large and attractive with white, green, greenish yellow or cream colors. The flowers&#x27; sepals and petals are similar. The lip is tubular-shaped and surrounds the long, bristly column, opening up, as the bell of a trumpet, at its apex. The anther is at the top of the column and hangs over the stigma, separated by the rostellum. Most &quot;Vanilla&quot; flowers have a sweet scent.

Blooming occurs only when the flowers are fully grown. Each flower opens up in the morning and closes late in the afternoon on the same day, never to reopen. If pollination has not occurred meanwhile, it will be shed. The flowers are self-fertile, but need pollinators to perform this task. In the Neotropics, the flowers were historically presumed to be pollinated by stingless bees (e.g. &quot;Melipona&quot;) or hummingbirds, but this was never confirmed; the only actual documented pollination (i.e., producing seed set) is recorded for an orchid bee, &quot;Eulaema meriana&quot;, visiting &quot;Vanilla grandiflora&quot; in Peru, and pollinia of &quot;Vanilla&quot; species have been observed attached to other species of &quot;Eulaema&quot; in Panama, and pollinia of &quot;Vanilla pompona&quot; are carried by males of &quot;Eulaema cingulata&quot; in Peru. Hand pollination is the most reliable method in commercially grown vanilla. Vanilla plantations require trees for the orchids to climb and anchor by its roots.

The fruit is termed &quot;vanilla bean&quot;, though true beans are fabaceous eudicots not at all closely related to orchids. Rather, the vanilla fruit is technically an elongate, fleshy and later dehiscent capsule 10–20 cm long. It ripens gradually for 8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving off a strong aroma. Each pod contains thousands of minute seeds, and both the pods and seeds within are used to create vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are harvested by hand from commercial orchards.

&quot;Vanilla&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the woolly bear moths &quot;Hypercompe eridanus&quot; and &quot;H. icasia&quot;. Off-season or when abandoned, they may serve as habitat for animals of open forest, e.g. on the Comoros for Robert Mertens&#x27;s day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma robertmertensi&quot;).

* &quot;Vanilla poitaei&quot; – Poiteau&#x27;s vanilla
* &quot;Vanilla polylepis&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla pompona&quot; – Pompona vanilla, Guadeloupe vanilla, &quot;West Indian vanilla&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla raabii&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla roscheri&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla shenzhenica&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla siamensis&quot; – Thai vanilla
* &quot;Vanilla somae&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla walkeriae&quot;
* &quot;Vanilla × tahitensis&quot;

==Aroma and flavor==
Regarded as the world&#x27;s most popular aroma and flavor, vanilla contains the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin, as well as anisaldehyde, together accounting for its predominant sensory characteristics. Vanilla is a widely used aroma and flavor compound for foods, beverages and cosmetics, as indicated by its popularity as an ice cream flavor.

<doc id="1183979" wikidata="Q2293576" url="?curid=1183979" title="F1 hybrid">
<text>F1 hybrid (also known asfilial 1 hybrid) is the first filial generation of offspring of distinctly different parental types. F1 hybrids are used in genetics, and in selective breeding, where the term F1 crossbreed may be used. The term is sometimes written with a subscript, as F hybrid. Subsequent generations are called F, F, etc.

The offspring of distinctly different parental types produce a new, uniform phenotype with a combination of characteristics from the parents. In fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species, while in plant and animal breeding, the parents often are two inbred lines.

Gregor Mendel focused on patterns of inheritance and the genetic basis for variation. In his cross-pollination experiments involving two true-breeding, or homozygous, parents, Mendel found that the resulting F1 generation was heterozygous and consistent. The offspring showed a combination of the phenotypes from each parent that were genetically dominant. Mendel&#x27;s discoveries involving the F1 and F2 generations laid the foundation for modern genetics.

==Production of F1 hybrids==
=== In plants ===

Crossing two genetically different plants produces a hybrid seed. This can happen naturally, and includes hybrids between species (for example, peppermint is a sterile F1 hybrid of watermint and spearmint). In agronomy, the term &quot;F1 hybrid&quot; is usually reserved for agricultural cultivars derived from two-parent cultivars. These F1 hybrids are usually created by means of controlled pollination, sometimes by hand pollination. For annual plants such as tomato and maize, F1 hybrids must be produced each season.

For mass production of F1 hybrids with uniform phenotype, the parent plants must have predictable genetic effects on the offspring. Inbreeding and selection for uniformity for multiple generations ensures that the parent lines are almost homozygous. The divergence between the (two) parent lines promotes improved growth and yield characteristics in offspring through the phenomenon of heterosis (&quot;hybrid vigour&quot; or &quot;combining ability&quot;).

Two populations of breeding stock with desired characteristics are subjected to inbreeding until the homozygosity of the population exceeds a certain level, usually 90% or more. Typically, this requires more than 10 generations. Thereafter, the two strains must be crossed, while avoiding self-fertilization. Normally, this is done with plants by deactivating or removing male flowers from one population, taking advantage of time differences between male and female flowering, or hand pollinating.

In 1960, 99% of all corn, 95% of sugar beet, 80% of spinach, 80% of sunflowers, 62% of broccoli, and 60% of onions planted in the United States were F1 hybrids. Beans and peas are not commercially hybridized because they are automatic pollinators, and hand pollination is prohibitively expensive.

====F2 hybrids====
F2 hybrids, the result of self or cross-pollination of F1s, lack the consistency of F1s, though they may retain some desirable traits and can be produced more cheaply because hand pollination or other interventions are not required. Some seed companies offer F2 seed at less cost, particularly in bedding plants, where consistency is less critical.

=== In animals ===

F1 crosses in animals can be between two inbred lines or between two closely related species or subspecies. In fish such as cichlids, the term F1 cross is used for crosses between two different wild-caught individuals that are assumed to be from different genetic lines.

Mules are F1 hybrids between horses (mares) and donkeys (jacks); the opposite sex cross results in hinnies. However, such offspring are almost always sterile.

Today, certain domesticated–wild hybrid breeds, such as the Bengal cat and the Savannah cat, are classified by their filial generation number. An F1 hybrid Savannah cat is the result of reproduction between an African Serval cat and a domestic cat.

As explained in the International Journal of Fauna and Biological Studies, there are four reasons for species hybridizations:

# Small population size
# Habitat fragmentation and species introduction
# Anthropogenic hybridization
# Visual, chemical, and acoustic interferences

Small population size can be caused by inadequate or obliterated natural habitats that lead to species escaping to other habitats and as a result, this may lead to lesser mate availability and can cause breeding between distinct species. Habitat fragmentation and species introduction can be man-made or caused by mother nature such as deforestation, desertification, eutrophication, urbanization, water oil extraction causing changes in the ecosystem that leads to animal migration or evading new surroundings. Third, is anthropogenic hybridization, which is &quot;artificial or human-led hybridization&quot; is supported for researchers to study &quot;reproductive compatibility between species&quot;. Lastly, visual, chemical, and acoustic interferences cues are what causes species to signal sexual cues by differentiating between the same and opposite-sex leading to hybridization.

== Advantages ==

* Homogeneity and predictability: The genes of an individual plant or animal F1 offspring of homozygous pure lines display limited variation, making their phenotype uniform, so attractive for mechanical operations and easing fine population management. Once the characteristics of the cross are known, repeating this cross yields the same result.
* Higher performance: As most alleles code for different versions of a protein or enzyme, having two different versions of this allele amounts to having two different versions of the enzyme. This increases the likelihood of an optimal version of the enzyme being present and reduces the likelihood of a genetic defect.

The advantages of species hybridization are 1.) evolution of new interspecific breed, 2.) hybrid vigour, and 3.) enhanced longevity and immunity to diseases (Dubey, A. 2019). Dubey explains each as follows: 1.) A new interspecific breed is due to the mating of two distinguished species. 2.) Hybrid vigour is defined as a species becoming sturdier, more dynamic, and stronger than the parents. Lastly, 3.) Hybrids can have improved longevity and are &quot;highly immune to diseases&quot; (Dubey, A. 2019).

== Disadvantages ==

* The main advantage of F1 hybrids in agriculture is also their drawback. When F1 cultivars are used as parents, their offspring (F2 generation) vary greatly from one another. Some F2s are high in homozygous genes, as found in their grandparents, and these will lack hybrid vigour. From the point of view of a commercial seed producer who does not wish customers to produce their own seed via seed saving, this genetic assortment is the desired characteristic.
* Both inbreeding and crossing the ancestral lines of the hybrid are costly, because of the time and number of generations involved, which translates into a much higher price. Not all crop species exhibit a sufficiently high heterosis effect to offset this disadvantage.
* F1 hybrids mature at the same time when raised under the same environmental conditions. They all ripen simultaneously and can be more easily harvested by machine. Traditional cultivars and landraces are often more useful to gardeners because they crop over a longer period of time, avoiding gluts or food shortages.

In contrast, the limitations can be due to genetic extinction and/or outbreeding depression. Dubey explains that genetic extinction can be caused by &quot;hybrid swarms&quot; noting the various degrees of hybrids. Outbreeding depression is the &quot;cross between genetically distant populations&quot; causing hybrids to reduce fit and isolation leading to reduced reproduction.

<text>Chizumulu Island is the smaller of two islands in Lake Malawi, the larger being the nearby Likoma island, which together make up the Likoma District. Both these islands lie just a few kilometres from Mozambique and are entirely surrounded by Mozambican territorial waters, but they belong to Malawi. They are therefore exclaves of Malawi. This came about because the islands were colonised by Anglican missionaries spreading east from Nyasaland, rather than by the Portuguese who colonised Mozambique. The British originally claimed the entire Lake Nyasa/Lake Malawi, but in 1954 signed an agreement with Portugal, which recognized the centre of the lake as the boundary between their holdings and Mozambique, and making these islands an enclave.

Chizumulu can be reached by steamer from the port of Nkhata Bay on the mainland of Malawi. The steamer that weekly crosses Lake Malawi stops at Chizumulu. Smaller boats including dhows cross the strait between Likoma and Chizumulu.

The island supports a population of about 4,000 people. Like Likoma, the island imports most of its food from the mainland. There is electricity on the island from 6am-10pm (with a break between 12-2pm), and no road. However, there is a well-constructed path which runs around the outside of the island, which can be walked around in about three hours.

The island consists of two large hills, with a flatter area to the south. Cassava plantations cover much of the lower slopes of the hills, with the upper parts being forested. Many baobab trees are present.

The locals speak a Nkamanga dialect, a dialect of Chitumbuka.

<text>Waegwan () is the seat of government for Chilgok County, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It consists primarily of the administrative district of Waegwan-eup. It is situated on both sides of the Nakdong River, which is traversed by railroad, automobile and pedestrian bridges.

Waegwan is home to a Benedictine monastery and the United States Army base at Camp Carroll. It lies on the Gyeongbu Line of the Korean National Railroad, and is also connected to Daegu and other major cities via the Gyeongbu Expressway.

==History==
Waegwan&#x27;s name literally means &quot;Japanese dwelling,&quot; and may indicate that the town was a common stopping-point for Japanese salt traders during the Joseon Dynasty.

In the summer of 1939, Korean and Japanese students from the Daegu Normal School (now the teachers&#x27; college of Kyungpook National University) were sent to Waegwan to do forced labor on the Gyeongbu Line railroad tracks. A demonstration, known as the Waegwan Incident (왜관사건) took place on July 26, in which Korean students protested preferential treatment given to Japanese students. In consequence, seven of the students were expelled.

=== Korean War ===
During the early phase of the Korean War in August and September 1950, the area around Waegwan was the site of intense fighting as North Korean forces pushed south toward Daegu. Monuments to the UN and South Korean forces now stand on the low mountain overlooking the northeastern section of the city, which is locally known as &quot;Jagosan&quot; and known in military reports as Hill 303.
In an attempt to slow the Northern advance, on August 3 American forces blew up the bridge at Waegwan while hundreds of refugees were crossing. This took place under the orders of Major General Hobart R. Gay and Lieutenant General Dell Plunkett. They claimed that among the refugees were North Korean soldiers in disguise. In the 1990s, the halves of the bridge were reconnected to serve as a pedestrian crossing between the two halves of Waegwan.

This was not the only atrocity committed in the area. On August 27, 1950, the retreating North Korean forces who had gained control of the area shot more than forty American POWs on Hill 303. Of these, five survived.

<doc id="1184000" wikidata="Q2018436" url="?curid=1184000" title="Old Melbourne Gaol">
<text>The Old Melbourne Gaol is a former jail and current museum on Russell Street, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It consists of a bluestone building and courtyard, and is located next to the old City Police Watch House and City Courts buildings, and opposite the Russell Street Police Headquarters. It was first constructed starting in 1839, and during its operation as a prison between 1845 and 1924, it held and executed some of Australia&#x27;s most notorious criminals, including bushranger Ned Kelly and serial killer Frederick Bailey Deeming. In total, 133 people were executed by hanging. Though it was used briefly during World War II, it formally ceased operating as a prison in 1924; with parts of the jail being incorporated into the RMIT University, and the rest becoming a museum.

The three-storey museum displays information and memorabilia of the prisoners and staff, including death masks of the executed criminals. At one time the museum displayed what was believed at the time to be Ned Kelly&#x27;s skull, before it was stolen in 1978; as well as the pencil used by wrongly convicted Colin Campbell Ross to protest his innocence in writing, before being executed.

==History==

An allotment of scrubland to the north-east of Melbourne was selected as Port Phillips first permanent gaol. On 1 January 1838, George Wintle was appointed to be gaoler at the prison at £100 a year; with the site becoming colloquially known as &quot;Wintle&#x27;s Hotel&quot;. Construction of the gaol started in 1839–1840 on Collins Street West, but it was considered too small at the time. A second gaol was then built between 1841 and 1844 at the corner of Russell and La Trobe Streets, adjoining the then Supreme Court. The first cell block was opened for prisoners in 1845, but the facilities were considered inadequate; escapes occurring frequently. The gaol was already crowded by 1850.

With the discovery of gold in 1851 (when the Port Phillip District became the new Colony of Victoria), and the resulting influx of population, law and order became more difficult to maintain. Subsequently, a new wing, with its own perimeter wall, was constructed between 1852 and 1854; the building using bluestone instead of sandstone. The design was based on that of British prison engineer Joshua Jebb, and especially the designs for the Pentonville Model Prison in London (which suited the current prison reform theories at the time). The new wing was extended in between 1857 and 1859, with the boundary wall also being extended during this time. In 1860, a new north wing was built; which included entrance buildings, a central hall and chapel. Between 1862 and 1864, a cell block was built for female prisoners on the western side – it was basically a replica of the present east block (until this time, female convicts were not kept apart from the male prisoners). In 1864, the perimeter wall, and the gaol overall, was completed; making it a dominant feature of authority on the Melbourne skyline.

At its completion, the prison occupied an entire city block, and included exercise yards, a hospital in one of the yards, a chapel, a bath house and staff accommodation. A house for the chief warders was built on the corner of Franklin and Russell streets, and 17 homes were built for gaolers on Swanston Street in 1860. Artefacts recovered from the area indicate that even the gaolers and their families lived within the gaol walls in the 1850s and 1860s.

===Operation===

Much of daily life inside the gaol could be gleaned from sources such as diaries written by John Castieau, governor of the gaol between 1869 and 1884. During its operation, the gaol was used to house short-term prisoners, lunatics and some of the colony&#x27;s most notorious and hardened criminals. It also housed up to twenty children at a time – including those imprisoned for petty theft or vagrancy, or simply those staying with a convicted parent. Babies under twelve months old were allowed to be with their mothers. The youngest prisoner was recorded as three-year-old Michael Crimmins, who spent 6 months in the prison in 1857 for being idle and disorderly. In 1851, the 13 and 14-year-old O&#x27;Dowd sisters were imprisoned because they had nowhere else to go.

Prisoners convicted of serious crimes, such as murder, arson, burglary, rape and shooting, would begin their time on the ground floor with a time of solitary confinement. They were also forbidden from communicating with other prisoners, which was strictly enforced by the usage of a silence mask, or calico hood, when outside their cells. They would only be given a single hour of solitary exercise a day, with the remaining 23 hours spent in their cells. Inside the cells, prisoners would be able to lie on a thin mattress over the slate floors. They could only bathe and change clothes once a week, and attend the chapel on Sundays (with a Bible provided to promote good behaviour). Prisoners might only have been allowed to finally socialise with other prisoners towards the end of their sentences.

The routine for prisoners was regulated by a system of bells, and enforced by punishments; prisoners who obeyed the rules would be promoted to the second floor – whereby they would be allowed to work in the yards every day. Male prisoners would perform hard labour – including breaking rocks, and other duties in the stone quarries, while women would sew, clean and cook. Women would also make shirts and waistcoats for male prisoners, as well as act as domestic servants for the governor and his family. Prisoners who had become trusted, those nearing the completion of their sentence, and debtors, were housed on the third floor communal cells. These top level cells were large, and held up to six prisoners at time; and were mostly reserved to prisoners convicted of minor crimes such as drunkenness, vagrancy, prostitution or petty theft.

===Executions===

During its operation, the gaol was the setting for 133 hangings. The most infamous was that of bushranger Ned Kelly at the age of 25, on 11 November 1880. After a two-day trial, Kelly was convicted of killing a police officer. As stated by law at the time, executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves in the gaol burial yard. Before burial, a death mask was produced from the executed prisoners head as part of the phrenological study of hanged felons. Historian and associate professor of Wollongong University, John McQuilton, states that the lack of monitoring for burial processes was odd, given Victorian society&#x27;s normally brilliant attention to detail.

The gallows occupied several different sites within the gaol. A free-standing scaffold was used for early executions, initially outside the main gate and later in one of the yards; for a triple hanging in 1864 it was erected just inside the main gate complex. Diarist Charles Evans witnessed the aftermath of the 1853 triple hanging of bushrangers William Atkins, George Wilson and George Melville:

After 1864 a fixed gallows was installed below the octagon across the main axis of the prison block, against the wall dividing the male block from the female block. It comprised a single-leaf trap cut into the metal walkway, with iron sockets in either wall above, into which the beam was placed for each hanging (a common design, used in other Victorian gaols at Ararat, Geelong, Beechworth, Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Melbourne and Pentridge; and interstate at Adelaide and Long Bay, New South Wales). It was later moved a few metres to a side gallery below the octagon, where it remains today.

The first hanging of a woman in Victoria, Elizabeth Scott, was performed in the prison on 11 November 1863 – along with her co-accused, Julian Cross and David Gedge. The last person to be executed was Angus Murray in 1924, the same year the gaol was closed.

====Ned Kelly====
Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Kelly, born sometime between June 1854 and June 1855, was an Irish-Australian bushranger. He was seen by some as merely a cold-blooded killer, while to others he was a folk hero for his defiance of the colonial authorities. As a youth he clashed with the Victoria Police, and after an incident at his home in 1878, police parties searched for him in the bush. He killed three policemen, and subsequently the colony proclaimed Kelly and his gang wanted outlaws. A final violent confrontation with police took place at Glenrowan on 28 June 1880. Kelly, dressed in a home-made plate metal armour and helmet, was captured and sent to gaol. He was hanged for murder at the Old Melbourne Gaol in November 1880. His notoriety affirmed him as a polarising iconic figure in Australian history, folk lore, literature, art and film.

====Colin Campbell Ross====

Colin Campbell Ross, an Australian wine-bar owner, was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of 12-year-old Alma Tirtschke in December 1921. The case, dubbed the &quot;Gun Alley Murder&quot;, was heavily influenced by public hysteria at the time, which ultimately served to condemn him. Despite his pleas of innocence (including an attempt whereby a letter was thrown over the gaol walls), he was executed by hanging in the gaol in April 1922 (only 115 days after the body was found). A new four-strand rope was used for the first time at the execution, and proved to be a failure; Ross slowly strangled for between 8 and 20 minutes before his death. A prison report later ruled that such a rope must never be used again. He was posthumously pardoned on 27 May 2008.

====Frederick Bailey Deeming====

Frederick Bailey Deeming was born on 30 July 1853. At 16 years of age he ran away to sea, and thereafter, he began a long career of crime, largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretences. He was responsible for the murder of his first wife Marie, and his four children, at Rainhill, England, on or about 26 July 1891, and a second wife, Emily, at Windsor, Melbourne, on 24 December 1891. Less than three months elapsed between the discovery of Emily Mather&#x27;s body in Windsor, Melbourne, in March 1892, and Deeming&#x27;s execution at the Old Melbourne Gaol for her murder in May 1892; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards. After his execution, it was reported that over 12,000 people cheered on the streets outside, and there was public speculation that Deeming was in fact Jack the Ripper.

==== Maulboyheener and Tunnerminnerwait ====
&quot;Tragically two of these (Aboriginal) men, Tunnerminnerwait (known as Jack) and Maulboyheenner (known as Bob, or sometimes called Timmy or Jimmy), became the first people executed in the Port Phillip District. This took place in 1842, a mere seven years after John Batman&#x27;s fraudulent treaty with the Kuhn people, when the two Tasmanian Aboriginal men were publicly hanged for murder.&quot; The Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner public marker exists at the place of execution. The website contains historical research and information on the artists commissioned for the marker, Artist Brook Andrew, along with Trent Walter.

&quot;Two Tasmanian Aboriginal men, clad in white pyjamas, went to their deaths on a makeshift gallows in Melbourne in 1842. The contemporaneous executions were apparently quite a spectacle: one man, Maulboyheenner, twisting on the rope, strangled slowly in front of a crowd of 5000. They had been convicted of killing two whalers in Western Port. Both the Tasmanians and the whalers – one was called the Yankee – were a long way from home.&quot; They were arrested at Powlett River.

====Executions====

===Closure and reopening===

In 1870, a review of the penal system was conducted, with the recommendation being made to close the gaol and relocate prisoners to more suitable locations. The gaol gradually slowed its operations, and demolished portions of the original site between 1880 and 1924. In 1924, the gaol was finally closed. However, in March 1927, the Old Melbourne Gaol was integrated into part of the new Emily McPherson College and was used for educational purposes. This necessitated changes to the prison; in 1929, despite poor record keeping of prisoner burials, historical evidence suggested the remains of approximately 32 executed prisoners, including Ned Kelly, were exhumed from the Old Melbourne Gaol and buried at mass graves in a quarry at Pentridge. In 1930, the women&#x27;s cell block, walls and several other buildings were demolished, and a further four coffins were believed to have been moved to Pentridge in 1937.

As the gaol was progressively decommissioned, the building&#x27;s fabric, including bluestone grave markers of executed prisoners, was incorporated into a sea wall at Brighton in Victoria in the 1930s. The grave marker for Martha Needle, executed in 1894, was rediscovered after being buried by metres of sand.
During World War II, the gaol was used as a military prison for soldiers found to be absent without leave. A new wall was built in the eastern courtyard during this time, so that cell block inmates were separated from the college girls. After the end of the war, the section used for holding prisoners was then used only as a storage facility for the Victoria Police force, whose headquarters were nearby in Russell Street.

In May 1974, the sections used by the school were remodelled by architects Eggleston, McDonald and Secomb, to act as the schools food and fashion departments. The Emily McPherson College was merged into RMIT University in 1979, bringing the gaol entrance gates, and other facilities alongside it. In 1990, RMIT performed work to restore the enclosed balcony to its former 1927 design. In 1994, RMIT performed further work to landscape the inner courtyard, and in 1995, removed the temporary war-time pavilion classrooms. , the sections that RMIT owns are collectively known as the &quot;RMIT Building 11. Architect: Colonial Government Architect&quot;, and include the entrance block and chapel; with the bath house and chapel serving as art studios.

==Museum==
In 1957, the National Trust of Australia listed the Old Melbourne Gaol on its heritage register, and a year later marked it as a site that needed to be preserved at all costs. Furthermore, in 1965, the Melbourne Junior Chamber of Commerce floated the idea of converting it into a museum, for the purposes of tourism. In 1972, the gaol was reopened as a public museum, under the management of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria).

, the gaol is recognised as Victoria&#x27;s oldest surviving penal establishment, and attracts approximately 140,000 visitors per year. The cells have been filled with information about individual prisoners, which also serve to illustrate the history of Melbourne itself.

In addition to historical information, it also includes various memorabilia; including death masks, an iron mask, and a pair of leather gloves designed to prevent inmates from practising self-abuse. Notably, it still includes Ned Kelly&#x27;s death mask, pistol and replica of his suit of armour. In addition, the gaol had previously displayed the pencil used by Colin Ross to write a letter protesting his innocence, which he threw over the prison walls.

Operators also run several features, including the candlelit &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Night Tour&quot; (with actors portraying prolific and brutal hangman Michael Gateley), and the daily &quot;Watch House Experience&quot;; an interactive performance in which visitors are treated as the prisoners would have been during its operation. In 2010, the Old Melbourne Gaol &quot;Crime and Justice Experience&quot; won the heritage and cultural tourism category at the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards in Hobart.

===Ned Kelly&#x27;s skull===
A skull, long believed to be Ned Kelly&#x27;s, was on display in the museum until it was stolen from a glass cabinet in 1978. Efforts have been taken by scientists and the government to determine the location of the skull, and whether it was authentic to begin with. It was reported that members of the public may have the remains of bones and teeth taken as souvenirs when graves were exhumed in 1929 for reburial at Pentridge Prison. A skull from a skeleton buried under the initials &quot;E.K.&quot; was taken, with the apparent assumption that this stood for Edward Kelly. Special interest was directed to finding a photograph of former South Melbourne councillor Alex Talbot holding skull purported to be Ned Kelly&#x27;s, and information on grave exhume contractor Lee of &quot;Lee and Dunn&quot;, or his family, who was tasked with delivering Kelly&#x27;s skull to the governor.

In 2009, West Australian farmer Tom Baxter handed a skull to authorities, arguing that it was the one stolen from the gaol – while refusing to explain how he obtained it. Further examination confirmed that the Baxter skull was indeed the same one previously on display at the Gaol museum, however DNA testing in 2011 showed that it had not been Kelly&#x27;s after all. Instead, it was suggested that it may have been that of executed murderer Ernest Knox, who was hanged 14 years after Kelly and also had the initials &quot;E.K.&quot;

Former Pentridge Prison chaplain Father Peter Norden has stated that he believed the skull handed in could not belong to Kelly, and that it probably belonged to a woman, however later DNA testing showed that the skull was from a male. In 2010, there was further speculation that the skull actually belonged to Frederick Bailey Deeming, with the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine claiming that the skull is similar to both Kelly&#x27;s and Deeming&#x27;s death masks.

Ned Kelly&#x27;s actual remains were later located in the grounds of Pentridge Prison, and confirmed by DNA comparison to living relatives, including a piece of his skull. This skull fragment showed saw marks, showing that Kelly&#x27;s cranium had been sawn open and the brain removed for research after death.

==Use in Ned Kelly films==

The films and TV productions &quot;Ned Kelly (1970)&quot;, &quot;Trial of Ned Kelly&quot; (1977), &quot;The Last Outlaw (1980)&quot;, &quot;Besieged: The Ned Kelly Story&quot; (2004), &quot;Ned&#x27;s Head&quot; (2011) and &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot; (2019) all used the interior of Old Melbourne Jail as a set for the scene of Kelly&#x27;s hanging. The scenes were filmed either at the actual location of Kelly&#x27;s execution or, in the 2019 movie, nearby.

<text>Scheele is a tiny, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that lies on the Oceanus Procellarum, to the south of the small crater Wichmann. To the southwest is the flooded crater Letronne. To the southwest of Scheele are several low ridges projecting above the surface of the lunar mare, the Dorsa Ewing.

This crater was named after the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. It was previously designated Letronne D.

<text>Shapley is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southern edge of Mare Crisium. It was named after American astronomer Harlow Shapley. It was previously designated Picard H. However the crater Picard lies about 150 kilometers to the north-northwest across the Mare Crisium. Somewhat closer to this crater are Tebbutt to the west, and Firmicus to the east-southeast.

This crater is roughly circular, but appears somewhat oval when viewed from the Earth due to foreshortening. The interior wall is slightly wider in the southern half, and the outer ridge is attached to a ridge that leads to the south then southeast. The interior floor has a dark hue that matches the adjacent lunar mare, having a lower albedo than the terrain to the south. There is a low central peak near the midpoint of the floor.

<text>Radmila Šekerinska Jankovska ( ; born 10 June 1972) is a Macedonian politician who has been serving as the Deputy Secretary General of NATO since November 2024. Previously she served as the defense minister of North Macedonia and a former leader of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM). Šekerinska was previously Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration and National Coordinator for Foreign Assistance of North Macedonia and also was the acting Prime Minister of North Macedonia from 12 May 2004 until 12 June 2004 and from 3 November 2004 until 15 December 2004. She was elected 5 November 2006 the SDUM leader. She is the first female (acting) prime minister of North Macedonia.

Šekerinska was elected President of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia at the party Congress following a no-confidence motion against the former leader Vlado Bučkovski. She left the position after the September 2008 party congress. Zoran Zaev was appointed as her successor until May 2009, when president Branko Crvenkovski&#x27;s term ended. During her term as a deputy Prime Minister responsible for European Affairs, the European Council, in December 2005, granted North Macedonia a status of candidate country for accession to the European Union. 

==Early life and education==
Šekerinska holds a Master&#x27;s Degree from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, which she obtained in 2007. She graduated in 1995 from Skopje&#x27;s Faculty of Electrical Engineering with a degree in Power Engineering.

==Political career==
Šekerinska became involved in the Open Society Institute of George Soros and in 1996 won a seat on Skopje City Council, which she held until she was elected to the Macedonian parliament in 1998. She subsequently became the deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM). She is a member of the presidency of the Party of European Socialists with which the SDSM is associated.

From 1997 to 2002, Šekerinska worked as an assistant at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Skopje, while in 1998 she was elected as a member of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia . She was elected for a deputy coordinator of the parliamentary group of the Social-Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDUM) and was a member of several parliamentary committees.

Šekerinska received a second mandate as an MP at the parliamentary elections in 2002, when she was immediately assigned Vice Premier of the Republic of Macedonia responsible for European integration.

Šekerinska served as spokeswoman in Crvenkovski&#x27;s successful campaign for the Macedonian presidency during March–April 2004. She then served as acting prime minister for three weeks after Crvenkovski resigned to become president. Šekerinska was reappointed deputy prime minister in the government of Crvenkovski&#x27;s successor as prime minister, Hari Kostov, on 3 June 2004.

Šekerinska is an author of a number of scientific and expert works.

On 1 May 2018, Šekerinska and U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis met at the Pentagon in Virginia to discuss the defense relationship between Macedonia and the United States. Additionally, the two discussed the naming dispute between Macedonia and Greece preventing the former&#x27;s accession into the EU and NATO, as well as Macedonia&#x27;s commitment to achieving 2% spending of GDP on defense.

On October 15, 2022, she was elected as one of the vice-presidents of the Party of European Socialists. On 19 November 2024, Secretary General of NATO Mark Rutte appointed Šekerinska as Deputy Secretary General.

<doc id="1184035" wikidata="Q7239847" url="?curid=1184035" title="Preferred provider organization">
<text>In U.S. health insurance, a preferred provider organization (PPO), sometimes referred to as a participating provider organization or preferred provider option, is a managed care organization of medical doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers who have agreed with an insurer or a third-party administrator to provide health care at reduced rates to the insurer&#x27;s or administrator&#x27;s clients.

== Overview ==
A preferred provider organization is a subscription-based medical care arrangement. A membership allows a substantial discount below the regularly charged rates of the designated professionals partnered with the organization. Preferred provider organizations themselves earn money by charging an access fee to the insurance company for the use of their network, unlike the usual insurance with premiums and corresponding payments paid either in full or partially by the insurance provider to the medical doctor. They negotiate with providers to set fee schedules and handle disputes between insurers and providers. PPOs can also contract with one another to strengthen their position in certain geographic areas without forming new relationships directly with providers. This will be mutually beneficial in theory as the PPO will be billed at the reduced rate when its insureds utilize the services of the &quot;preferred&quot; provider, and the provider will see an increase in its business as almost all insureds in the organization will only use providers who are members. PPOs have gained popularity because, although they tend to have slightly higher premiums than HMOs and other more restrictive plans, they offer patients more flexibility overall.

== History ==
In 1980, an early PPO was organized in Denver at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center at the suggestion of Samuel Jenkins, an employee of the Segal Group who consulted with hospitals for Taft-Hartley trust funds. By 1982, 40 plans were counted and by 1983 variations such as the exclusive provider organization had arisen. In the 1980s, PPOs spread in cities in the Western United States, particularly California due to favorable state laws.

== PPO ==
Other features of a preferred provider organization generally include utilization review, where representatives of the insurer or administrator review the records of treatments provided to verify that they are appropriate for the condition being treated rather being largely, or solely, being performed to increase the number of people due. Another near-universal feature is a pre-certification requirement, in which scheduled (non-emergency) hospital admissions, and in some instances, outpatient surgery, must have the prior approval of the insurer and must often undergo &quot;utilization review&quot; in advance.

== Comparison to exclusive provider organization (EPO) ==
A PPO is similar to an exclusive provider organization (EPO) in structure, administration, and operation. Unlike EPO members, however, PPO members are reimbursed for using medical care providers outside of their network of designated doctors and hospitals. However, when they use out-of-network providers PPO members are reimbursed at a reduced rate that may include higher deductibles and co-payments, lower reimbursement percentages, or a combination of these financial penalties. EPO members, on the other hand, receive no reimbursement or benefit if they visit medical care providers outside of their designated network of doctors and hospitals. EPOs do allow reimbursement outside of the network in emergency cases, per the Affordable Care Act.

== Comparison to health maintenance organization (HMO) ==
A PPO is similar to a health maintenance organization (HMO) in structure, administration, and operation. Unlike PPOs, however, HMOs often require members to select a primary care physician (PCP), a doctor who acts as a gatekeeper to direct access to non-emergency medical services, and are required to first obtain a referral from their PCP in order to be reimbursed for the cost of medical services inside of their network of designated doctors and hospitals. HMO plans generally have lower cost and lower monthly premiums than PPO plans and HMO members can usually expect to pay less out of pocket to cover medical costs than PPO members.

<text>Computer-supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) is an abstraction layer for telecommunications applications. It is independent of underlying protocols. It has a telephone device model that enables CTI applications to work with a wide range of telephone devices. 

Originally developed in 1992, it has continued to be developed and refined over the years. It is often the model that most CTI applications are built on and claim compliance with. It became an OSI standard in July 2000. It is currently being maintained by ECMA International.

The core of CSTA is a normalized Call Control model. Additional to the core there are Call Associated features and Physical Device features amongst others. An implementation of the standard need not provide all features, and so Profiles are provided. For example, the Basic Telephony profile provides such features as Make Call, Answer and Clear Connection.

==History==
CSTA has seen 3 major revisions to date.

* Phase 1 1992
* Phase 2 1994
* Phase 3 1998

==Recent developments==
Phase 3 of the CSTA standard saw the introduction of uaCSTA, CSTA XML and CSTA Object Model extensions. These extensions are in various states of completion but all extend the scope of CSTA.

==Example of Underlying Protocols==
Protocols that may be used by CSTA.

* SIP
* H.323
* ACSE/ROSE

* CTI
* Java Telephony API
* Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI)

<text>The Central European Olympiad in Informatics (CEOI) is an annual informatics competition for secondary school students. Each of the participating central European countries (plus one or two guest countries, and a local team from the host area) sends a team of up to four contestants, a team leader and a deputy team leader. The contestants compete individually, i.e. a team score is not calculated. Competitors are selected through national competitive programming contests.

The contest consists of two days computer programming, solving problems of an algorithmic nature. The structure of these competition days is described in the article about the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), which served as a role model for the more local CEOI.

The first CEOI was held in 1994 in Romania (founder of the CEOI), five years after the first IOI.

<text>Stewart is a small lunar impact crater that lies to the northeast of the Mare Spumans, a small lunar mare near the eastern limb of the Moon. It was named after American astrophysicist John Quincy Stewart. It is located to the north of the crater Pomortsev, and to the southwest of the lava-flooded Dubyago. Stewart was previously designated Dubyago Q before being named by the IAU. This is a circular crater with a low outer rim and a level, featureless interior floor.

<doc id="1184066" wikidata="Q2334511" url="?curid=1184066" title="Cerise (color)">
<text>Cerise ( or ; ) is a deep to vivid reddish pink.

==Etymology==

The color or name comes from the French word , meaning &quot;cherry&quot;.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of &quot;cerise&quot; as a color name in English was in &quot;The Times&quot; of November 30, 1858. This date of 1858 as the date of first use of the color name is also mentioned in the 1930 book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot;. However, it was used at least as early as 1845 in a book of crochet patterns.

==Variations of cerise==
There are various tones of cerise.

===Hollywood cerise===
In the 1950s, a popular brand of colored pencils, Venus Paradise, had a colored pencil called Hollywood cerise which was this color. Before being renamed Hollywood cerise in the 1940s, the color had been known, since its inception in 1922, simply as Hollywood.
===Deep cerise===
Displayed adjacent is the deep tone of cerise called &quot;cerise&quot; in Crayola crayons (see the List of Crayola crayon colors).

The color name &quot;cerise&quot; has been used for this color since 1993 by Crayola.
===Irresistible===

The color irresistible is displayed adjacent.

The color name irresistible first came into use in the Plochere Color System, a color system formulated in 1948 that is widely used by interior designers.

The for irresistible are identical to raspberry rose, which was first recorded as a color name in English in 1950 in the &quot;Descriptive Color Names Dictionary&quot;.

<doc id="1184069" wikidata="Q6260083" url="?curid=1184069" title="John T. Raulston">
<text>John Tate Raulston (September 22, 1868 – July 11, 1956) was an American state judge in Rhea County, Tennessee, who received national publicity for presiding over the 1925 Scopes trial, a famous creationism–evolution debate.

==Early life and education==
Raulston, who was a member of a prominent Republican family, was born on a small farm in Marion County, Tennessee. He attended U.S. Grant University, later known as Tennessee Wesleyan College, and was admitted to the bar in 1896. He served in the Tennessee state legislature and was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1908 against John A. Moon. He was elected judge of the Eighteenth Tennessee District in 1918.

==Scopes Trial==
Raulston commenced the proceedings by obtaining the grand jury indictment of John T. Scopes, a 24-year-old schoolteacher. Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and &quot;... all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom.&quot;

During the trial, Raulston sided with the prosecution and barred testimony from experts in theology and the natural sciences. He was accused of being biased and frequently clashed with famed attorney Clarence Darrow, who represented Scopes. At the outset of the trial, Raulston quoted Genesis and the state Butler Act, which was the basis of the prosecution. He also warned the jury not to judge the merit of the law, which would become the focus of the trial. Contemporary accounts refer to him as &quot;plump, red-faced and middle aged.&quot;

After a raucous trial, in which Darrow squared off against William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, Scopes was convicted and fined $100. The conviction was reversed by an appellate court because the maximum fine was $50, but Scopes was never retried.

After the trial, Raulston gave lectures on the legal aspects of fundamentalism. But he was unable to build a political future on the Scopes trial, and he was defeated for reelection a year after the trial. He later ran for governor and retired in the mid-1940s. In a statement several years after the trial, Raulston said that he had modified his views and no longer believed that the state should pass laws limiting the right to teach science to students when doing so didn&#x27;t harm their morals.

Raulston was portrayed as the character Judge Merle Coffey in the play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; and the 1960 film adaptation. In the film, the character of the judge was played by Harry Morgan. He was also played by John Cullum in the 1999 television remake.

<doc id="1184084" wikidata="Q866494" url="?curid=1184084" title="Three-point lighting">
<text>Three-point lighting is a standard method used in visual media such as theatre, video, film, still photography, computer-generated imagery and 3D computer graphics. By using three separate positions, the photographer can illuminate the shot&#x27;s subject (such as a person) however desired, while also controlling (or eliminating) the shading and shadows produced by direct lighting.

== Setup ==

=== Key Light ===
The &quot;key light&quot;, as the name suggests, shines directly upon the subject and serves as its principal illuminator; more than anything else, the strength, color and angle of the key determines the shot&#x27;s overall lighting design.

In indoor shots, the key is commonly a specialized lamp, or a camera&#x27;s flash. In outdoor daytime shots, the Sun often serves as the key light. In this case, of course, the photographer cannot set the light in the exact position they want, so instead arranges the shot to best capture the sunlight, perhaps after waiting for the sun to position itself just right.

=== Fill Light ===

The &quot;fill light&quot; also shines on the subject, but from a side angle relative to the key and is often placed at a lower position than the key (about at the level of the subject&#x27;s face). It balances the key by illuminating shaded surfaces, and lessening or eliminating chiaroscuro effects, such as the shadow cast by a person&#x27;s nose upon the rest of the face. It is usually softer and less bright than the key light, up to half the amount. Not using a fill at all can result in stark contrasts (due to shadows) across the subject&#x27;s surface, depending upon the key light&#x27;s harshness. Sometimes, as in low-key lighting, this is a deliberate effect, but shots intended to look more natural and less stylistic require a fill.

In some situations a photographer can use a reflector (such as a piece of white cardstock mounted off-camera, or even a white-painted wall) as a fill light instead of an actual lamp. Reflecting and redirecting the key light&#x27;s rays back upon the subject from a different angle can cause a softer, subtler effect than using another lamp.

=== Backlight ===
The back, hair, or shoulder light shines on the subject from behind, typically, though not necessarily, to one side. Backlight is different from a kick or kicker in that it contributes to a portion of the shading on the visible surface of the subject.

Backlighting provides the subject a rim of light, which separates the subject from the background and highlights contours. This creates a thin outline around the subject without necessarily hitting its front visible surface.
==Four-point lighting==

The addition of a fourth light, the &quot;background light&quot;, makes for a four-point lighting setup.

The background light is placed behind the subject(s), on a high grid, or low to the ground. Unlike the other three lights, which illuminate foreground elements like actors and props, it illuminates background elements, such as walls or outdoor scenery. This technique can be used to eliminate shadows cast by foreground elements onto the background, or to draw more attention to the background. It also helps to off-set the single eye nature of the camera, this means that it helps the camera give depth to the subject.

<text>Frederick Edgar Dinenage ( ; born 8 June 1942) is a British author, broadcaster and television presenter. His television career has spanned nearly 60 years, including the long-running children&#x27;s programme &quot;How&quot; and ITV&#x27;s regional programming in the south of England. Dinenage retired from presenting regional news on ITV Meridian on 16 December 2021, after 38 years as a news anchor.

==Early life and education==
Dinenage was born in Birmingham. He was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School.

==Career==
Dinenage has appeared as presenter of many British television programmes (many of them produced by Southern Television, and its successors TVS and Meridian Broadcasting), such as &quot;Tell The Truth&quot;, &quot;How&quot; and its successor &quot;How 2&quot;, as well as the BBC quiz show &quot;Pass The Buck&quot; and &quot;Gambit&quot; (produced by Anglia).

=== News anchor ===
Dinenage began his career at Southern Television in 1964, as a presenter on &quot;Three Go Round&quot;, a part-networked children&#x27;s programme, alongside actress Diane Keen and future television producer Britt Allcroft.

He later moved onto the station&#x27;s local news magazine programme, &quot;Day By Day&quot;, as a reporter and presenter. In later years, he concentrated on sports coverage, hosting the programme&#x27;s weekly &quot;South Sport&quot; feature.

Dinenage transferred from Southern to TVS in January 1982, chiefly as a sports presenter and reporter, working on &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Sportshow&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Match&quot;. The following year, he took over from Khalid Aziz as the main anchor for the South edition of &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, co-presenting alongside Christopher Peacock, Fern Britton, Debbie Thrower and Mai Davies.

After TVS lost its franchise, Dinenage was retained by Meridian as anchor for the South edition of &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; and other non-news regional programmes. His co-anchors included Debbie Thrower, Natasha Kaplinsky, Jane Wyatt and, from 2009, Sangeeta Bhabra with whom he presented pan-regional editions of the show.

In October 2021, it was announced that Dinenage would step down from ITV, after 38 years as a news anchor in the south of England. His final edition of &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot; aired on 16 December 2021.

=== Other work ===
Dinenage spent a brief period in the late 1970s covering regional sport for Yorkshire Television. He also appeared as a relief presenter of the networked ITV Saturday afternoon show, &quot;World of Sport&quot; – a role which earned him an appearance on the children&#x27;s Saturday show &quot;Tiswas&quot;. He also has his own weekly column featured on the magazine of the Southampton local newspaper &quot;Southern Daily Echo&quot;.

Alongside his television career, Dinenage has written several factual books, including ghosting on autobiographies &quot;My Story&quot; and &quot;Our Story&quot; for the Kray twins. He is a keen football follower and was on the board of directors at Portsmouth between 1998 and 2007. He was a team captain on the ITV game show &quot;Never Had It So Good&quot;, shown in 2002. He also narrated driver&#x27;s eye views for railway filming company Video 125.

In February 2014, he celebrated his 50th anniversary as a reporter and presenter with ITV, announcing that he hoped to continue broadcasting into the future. &quot;Fred Dinenage: Murder Casebook&quot;, a crime documentary series on 20th century murders was first broadcast on the Crime &amp; Investigation Network in 2011. He has also narrated &quot;Most Evil Killers&quot; for Pick since 2017.

Dinenage was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, for services to broadcasting.

On 16 October 2020, it was announced Dinenage would appear in a new series of &quot;How&quot;, alongside Vick Hope, Sam Homewood and Frankie Vu. Dinenage appears as the &quot;Head of How&quot; in an office apparently above the How studio set, which features a picture of a much younger Dinenage as one of its many decorations.

In June 2023, it was announced Dinenage would join BBC Radio Solent to present on Saturdays afternoons for six weeks during the summer. His first show was on 17 June.

==Family==
Dinenage&#x27;s second daughter Dame Caroline Dinenage (born 1971) is the Conservative member of Parliament for Gosport, first elected at the 2010 general election. She served as the Digital and Culture Minister between February 2020 and September 2021 and is married to Mark Lancaster, Baron Lancaster of Kimbolton.

<doc id="1184099" wikidata="Q978664" url="?curid=1184099" title="River Devon, Nottinghamshire">
<text>The River Devon is a tributary of the River Trent, which rises in Leicestershire and joins the Trent at Newark in Nottinghamshire, England. In its upper reaches, it supplies Knipton Reservoir, which was built to supply water to the Grantham Canal, and Belvoir Lakes, designed by Capability Brown. It passes under the Grantham Canal, and then through Bottesford, where it is spanned by five railway bridges, only one of which is still used for its original purpose. On the outskirts of Newark, it passes by two Civil War structures, and just before it joins the Trent it becomes navigable, with a marina located on the west bank. Its name is pronounced &quot;Deevon&quot;, &quot;not&quot; as spelt.

==Hydrology==
The river has a catchment of and had an average flow of 29.8 million gallons (135.6 Megalitres) per day, measured at the gauging station in Cotham, near the mouth. However, the gauging station was closed in 1978, due to doubts about the reliability of its measurements, and there is currently no gauging station on the river. The catchment receives of rainfall in an average year.

==Course==
The river rises as a series of springs and streams near the villages of Eastwell, Bottesford (Leics) Eaton in north-east Leicestershire, close to the contour, and flows generally northwards. Passing close to Branston, it flows into Knipton reservoir, built in the 1790s to supply the Grantham Canal. 
The surface area of the reservoir is , and it feeds the canal through a channel, called &quot;The Carrier&quot;, which has open sections and runs through a tunnel for about .
In 2006, British Waterways completed a refurbishment programme on the dam and spillway which cost £170,000.
The village of Knipton is a little further to the north, on the eastern bank of the river. An unnamed tributary flows through the village to join the river, after which it enters woodland, where it is joined by a stream flowing eastwards from a small lake called Frog Hollow. Belvoir upper lake and Belvoir lower lake come next, each covering and created by the landscape architect Capability Brown in the grounds of the Belvoir Castle estate. They are used for coarse fishing. Between them, an early 19th-century bridge with five arches and long retaining walls, built from ironstone and limestone, acts as a weir. After the lakes, the river passes to the east of Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir and the hamlet of Stenwith, to flow under the Grantham Canal in a conduit. By this time it is below the contour. The county border between Leicestershire and Lincolnshire follows the course of the river for a short distance near the bottom lake, and beyond Woolsthorpe, the river is in Lincolnshire.

Passing back into Leicestershire, it flows through Muston and Bottesford, where there are a number of bridges. At the end of Church Street, Fleming&#x27;s bridge is a double-arched grade II listed medieval bridge, now just used by pedestrians, which was built for Samuel Fleming, who was rector in the village between 1581 and 1620. At Devon Lane, there is a ford, besides which stands a single-arched brick bridge, with two holes passing through the spandrels, and iron railings in the centre of the parapet. It was built in the early 19th century. Beyond the village, the river is crossed by four railway bridges, only one of which is still in use, carrying the line from Grantham to Nottingham. A fifth bridge, located in fields to the north of the village, consisting of three brick arches, carried the Newark to Leicester railway line over the river. It was opened in 1860, and ceased to be used for railway traffic in 1960. The centre arch collapsed after heavy rain in 2007, and the whole structure has been replaced by a single steel span, resting on the remains of two of the piers.

The river again forms the county border, until it reaches Staunton in the Vale, which is in Nottinghamshire. The Winter Beck joins the west bank, as does the River Smite soon afterwards. The river passes Cotham which lies to the east, and runs close to a Civil War redoubt at Hawton, to arrive at the outskirts of Newark-on-Trent. Here it passes another civil war defence, the Queen&#x27;s Sconce, built in 1644 at a strategic point overlooking the Devon, the Trent and the Great North Road. The site was bought by Newark Urban Council in 1912, and formed part of Devon Park, which has since been extended by further acquisitions of land. Crossing under the B6166, which follows the course of the Fosse Way Roman road at this point, the Devon joins the River Trent. Below the bridge, the river is used for moorings, and there is a marina on the western bank. The mouth is below the contour.

==Water Quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Devon was as follows in 2019. Data for the middle section covers a large section of the River Smite and a small section of the Devon after the two rivers have joined. Reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge for most of the river, and physical modification of the channel and poor nutrient management on adjacent agricultural land on the upper sections.
Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment. However the ecological status of the upper river improved from poor to moderate, while the lower river deteriorated from moderate to poor.

<doc id="1184108" wikidata="Q1631636" url="?curid=1184108" title="Hoverspeed">
<text>Hoverspeed was a ferry company that operated on the English Channel from 1981 until 2005. It was formed in 1981 by the merger of Seaspeed and Hoverlloyd. Its last owners were Sea Containers; the company ran a small fleet of two high-speed SeaCat catamaran ferries in its final year.

Hoverspeed played a part in developing the hovercraft, and ran six SR.N4 Mountbatten class hovercraft and one SEDAM N500 Naviplane. Hoverspeed last operated hovercraft on its Dover to Calais service. They were withdrawn on 1 October 2000 and Hoverspeed continued to use Seacat catamarans built by Incat.

== Background and formation ==
=== Early attempts to consolidate operations ===
During the early 1970s, when both Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed were struggling to return a profit, the two operators had been in negotiations on a partnership to amalgamate operations. However, management at Hoverlloyd was not convinced the UK government would sanction any form of arrangement between Seaspeed and a foreign company. The situation was exacerbated when discussions became public knowledge and plans for a consortium were quickly abandoned.

=== Loss-making company ===
In late 1981, when the two companies eventually merged, the situation was dire. Despite a valuation at £110 million, combined losses were £8 million with ticket prices 25 to 30% higher than the ferries. Under the terms of the merger, Hoverspeed was also under obligation to accept the two French hovercraft in exchange for a 10% participation in share capital by French state-owned SNCF. The new company was spearheaded by Gerry Draper, new Chief Executive and a former marketing director at British Airways. Draper had been involved in filling empty passenger seats aboard the new Boeing 747 jumbo jets in the early 1970s when IATA regulations prohibited discounting. He was also successful in turning Concorde services profitable.

Nevertheless, a number of early decisions plagued the new company. First, Hoverspeed inherited an antiquated reservation system which was inadequate, resulting in potential travellers having great difficulty in contacting Hoverspeed and many being told crossings were fully booked when they were not. This necessitated the reversion to a very basic manual reservation system to try to cope with demand. In 1982, loss income was estimated at between £3 million and £4 million. Second, excess capacity drove profit margins down. The most damaging mistake was to increase the number of crossings operated, over 10,000 in 1982, which did not match demand and the decision to briefly re-open the Ramsgate route for the summer season which was counter-productive. Third, parity pricing continued with ferry operators, even during peak season. This was a source of concern since 70% of the turnover (and traffic) was generated during the summer season between mid-June and mid-September.

Despite carrying 2.5 million passengers and 400,000 vehicles, a 21% market share, with 35% fewer flights and 250 staff made redundant, the new entity continued to register losses with £5.5 million for the year 1982, £3.5 million in 1983. The new French hovercraft, the N500, achieved only 60% reliability and did not meet ride comfort or control standards. It was eventually broken up for spares and scraps. The SR.N4 craft, moreover, could not accommodate the recently introduced double-deck and one-and-a-half deck coaches and this part of the market was lost. By 1984, the company was near collapse.

=== Management buy-out ===
In February 1984, the UK government refused to provide further guaranteed loans, British Rail sold its 50% ownership which it had retained in the company (and its losses) for a nominal sum of £1 to a syndicate consortium of 5 directors. Thus, Hoverspeed was effectively given away to its own management and was wholly owned within the private sector backed by merchant bank Kleinwort Benson providing guarantees and underwriting the cash needed to operate via NatWest.
The company immediately adopted premium instead of parity pricing, justified on the grounds that a faster service was expected to be more expensive. An aggressive advertising campaign was mounted against the ferries and more effort was made to target fares accurately. For 1984, the company made a loss of £621,000. Its performance went up with a pre-tax profit of £194,000 for 1985 with an increase in US passengers. This figure rose to £625,000 in 1986.

=== Purchase by British Ferries Ltd ===

Ripe for sale, in February 1986, Hoverspeed was sold by the management consortium to British Ferries (Sealink UK&#x27;s holding company) owned by Sea Containers, a transport group engaged in marine container leasing, manufacturing, depot and logistics operations, railways operator, ferry operator and leisure industry investor for a sum of £5 million, each syndicate making a profit of £600,000. Large financial gains made by former managers of British Rail was to become a feature of rail privatization.

In 1987, Hoverspeed returned a profit of £1.6 million with a turnover of £42.3 million per year and £4.7 million in 1988 and a turnover of £44 million per year.

Being part of a larger shipping company allowed fresh re-capitalization, cheaper fuel as well as access to legal services. With the reduced fleet of hovercraft aging, it also permitted capital investment into more fuel efficient vessels with the first SeaCat catamaran services introduced in 1991 and larger Super SeaCats in 1997, the latter to achieve economies of scale in the face of stiff competition from the Channel Tunnel and the ferry companies.

== Routes ==
Hoverspeed operated several routes. These were:

* Dover – Calais (1981–2005; Hovercraft, Seacat and SuperSeaCat service): Hoverspeed&#x27;s primary service was established by British Rail owned Seaspeed in 1968 with the car carrying SRN 4 Hovercraft &quot; The Princess Anne&quot; and &quot;The Princess Margaret&quot;. Seaspeed were not the first hovercraft service between Dover and Calais, Townsend Car Ferries had operated a passenger-only SR.N6 in 1966. Hoverlloyd also ran hovercraft services in 1966 to Calais but from Ramsgate. Seacats were introduced on the route on 2 June 1991. It was intended that the Seacats would replace the remaining SRN 4 hovercraft but this did not happen until 2000. The Dover – Calais service has seen all members of the Hoverspeed fleet operation on it at some point. The route closed on 7 November 2005, the &quot;Seacat Diamant&quot; operating the last crossing.
* Dover – Boulogne-sur-Mer (1968–1993; Hovercraft and Seacat service): the Dover-Boulogne route was opened in 1966 by Townsend Car Ferries using an SR.N6 passenger-only hovercraft. In 1993 Hoverspeed closed the Dover-Boulogne route after deciding that the Hoverport at Le Portel (near Boulogne-sur-Mer) was no longer required, and the SeaCat operation moved to nearby Folkestone.
* Dover – Ostend (1998–2003; Seacat and Superseacat service): after the failure of the Holyman Sally Line service from Ramsgate to Ostend, Holyman became partners with Hoverspeed and moved the service to Dover. The 81m Incat fastcraft used on the service lost their &#x27;Holyman&#x27; prefix and became the Rapide and Diamant. Sea Containers later bought Holyman&#x27;s share in the operation and the fastcraft.
* Folkestone – Boulogne (1993–2000; Seacat service): after transferring the Boulogne route to Folkestone, Hoverspeed used Hoverspeed Great Britain and kept the hovercraft at Dover. In 2000 the Hoverspeed service ended and in 2001 the port at Folkestone closed to all ferry traffic after the termination of the Falcon Marfreight service.
* Newhaven – Dieppe (1999–2004; Superseacat and Seacat service): Hoverspeed took over the high-speed passenger service after P&amp;O Stena Line&#x27;s withdrawal the year before. The route was continued using SuperSeaCat One. Hoverspeed&#x27;s last service on the route was at the end of the 2004 summer season. Despite taking bookings for 2005 they withdrew from the route: a deal that would have seen Transmanche Ferries charter &quot;Superseacat One&quot; for the route fell through.
* Portsmouth – Cherbourg (1990–1991): Hoverspeed&#x27;s first Seacat route using the &quot;Hoverspeed Great Britain&quot;; this was closed on 6 January 1991 after a series of technical problems throughout the operating season.
* Ramsgate Hoverport – Calais (1982): the former Hoverlloyd route was run from the purpose-built hoverport at Pegwell Bay from the merger until the end of the 1982 season

* &quot;Seacat Tasmania&quot; (Incat Hull 023, built 1990) operated for Hoverspeed in 1992 on the Folkestone – Boulogne route and in 1993 on Dover – Calais along with the Folkestone service. Renamed &quot;Seacat Calais&quot; in mid-1993 before being chartered out in late 1993, it returned to Hoverspeed in 1999 and ran on the Dover-Calais service. In 2000 it moved to the SNAV/Sea Containers joint venture as &quot;Croazia Jet&quot; before again returning to Hoverspeed in 2002 as &quot;Seacat France&quot;. It was chartered by Emeraude Ferries as &quot;Emeraude France&quot; for two months in 2005. It was sold to an unknown buyer for a reported US$2 million in February 2007.

It operated for Hoverspeed on the Dover - Calais route in 1992, 2003 and 2004. It is now operating in Greece for Seajets as HSC &quot;Cyclades Express&quot;.

=== Fincantieri MDV1200 Superseacats===

Four Superseacats were ordered by Hoverspeed&#x27;s parent company Sea Containers after the original Superseacat design built by Austal failed to meet the speed required.

* &quot;Superseacat One&quot; (built 1997). Entered service in 1997.
: After operating on Sea Containers Frederikshavn to Gothenburg route the vessel entered service with Hoverspeed in 2000 on the Newhaven - Dieppe route. In 2001 she moved to operate with two of her sisters on the Dover - Calais and Ostend routes. She returned to the Dieppe route in 2002 where she remained until the end of the 2004 summer season when the Hoverspeed service from the port ended.

In service with Hoverspeed 1999–2004. Left fleet in 2004, chartered.

* &quot;Superseacat Two&quot; (built 1997). Entered service in 1997.
: Entered service with Hoverspeed in June 1997 on the Dover – Calais service where she remained until March 1998. She moved to the Sea Containers/Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (IOMSPC) Liverpool – Dublin service. She was replaced in that service by her sister Superseacat Three in 1999 so she moved back to Hoverspeed for the Newhaven - Dieppe service for a season. She returned to with Hoverspeed in 2000 on the Newhaven - Dieppe route. In 2001 she returned to Dover to operate with two of her sisters on the Dover – Calais and Ostend routes. At somepoint she operated on the Heysham – Belfast route before returning again to the Dieppe route in 2003.

In serviced with Hoverspeed 1997, 1999 and 2001. Left fleet in 2001, sold.

* &quot;Superseacat Three&quot; (built 1999).

She was transferred to the Baltic Sea operations of Silja Line but was not included in the 2006 sale of the company to Tallink.

In service with Hoverspeed 2001. Left fleet in 2001, returned to SeaCat.

===Incat 81 metre (265&#x27;) catamarans===
* &quot;Diamant&quot; (Incat hull 041, built 1996).
: Purchased by Holyman before completion in 1996 she was launched as &quot;Holyman Express&quot; but was renamed &quot;Holyman Diamant&quot; in 1997 as a result of a competition to decide the names of the fast ferries for use on the Holyman Sally service between Ramsgate and Ostend. In 1998 Holyman Hoverspeed was formed and the vessel&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Diamant&quot;. Her UK base of operations was moved to Dover and she received Seacat livery. Hoverspeed eventually purchased Holyman&#x27;s share and &quot;Diamant&quot; came under Sea Containers ownership. She remained on the Dover – Ostend route until 2001 where she operated on the Newhaven – Dieppe route for the summer season. In 2002 she briefly operated for IOMSPC before commencing her last summer on Newhaven – Dieppe. In 2004 she transferred to Dover – Calais where she remained until the closure of the service in November 2005 . For her last two seasons in Hoverspeed service she wore a distinctive Union Flag livery in an attempt to show how British Hoverspeed were, &quot;Diamant&quot; was built in Australia, owned by a Bermuda registered company and the vessel itself was registered in Nassau, Bahamas and later moved to the Italian Registry as &quot;Seacat Diamant&quot;. Along with her sister she has been reported as sold to Balearia. She left Liverpool (where she was chartered to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company to provide additional capacity for the 2006 TT races period) for Oporto, Portugal (unlike &quot;Rapide&quot; which sailed to Algeciras) on 20 June 2006, two days after her sister left Tilbury. As of July 2006, she was chartered to Balearia Eurolineas of Spain and renamed &quot;Jaume III&quot;.
* &quot;Rapide&quot; (Incat hull 038, built 1996).
: Built for Holyman as &quot;Condor 12&quot; she initially operated for Condor Ferries which at the time was part owned by Holyman. She was replaced by a larger fastcraft in 1997 and moved to Holyman Sally&#x27;s Ramsgate - Ostend service. As was the case with &quot;Diamant&quot; she was renamed &quot;Holyman Rapide&quot; as a result of a competition. In 1998 she was transferred to Holyman Hoverspeed along with her sister and the vessel&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Rapide&quot;. She briefly returned to Condor Ferries to cover for the refit of Condor Express and operated between Poole and the Channel Islands for one month. Along with the &quot;Diamant&quot;, &quot;Rapide&quot; came under Sea Containers ownership. She remained on the Dover – Ostend route until 2001 when she moved to the Sea Containers/IOMSPC Liverpool – Dublin service. In 2002 she moved to Heysham – Belfast and eventually replaced &quot;Seacat Scotland&quot; on the Belfast – Troon service in 2003 until the end of the 2004 season. In 2005 she transferred to Dover – Calais alongside her sister where she remained until the closure of the service in the same year . She was renamed &quot;Seacat Rapide&quot; upon her transfer to the Italian register. She also received the Hoverspeed Union Flag livery. On 18 June 2006 she sailed from her lay-up spot at Tilbury, London to Algeciras. She has now been sold to Baleària Eurolineas and renamed &quot;Jaume II&quot;.

== Closure ==
After sustaining losses annually since 1995 (the last financial year the company returned a pre-tax profit) it was clear, by the early 2000s, Hoverspeed could no longer continue operating business-as-usual.

* Competition from the Channel Tunnel

Despite the introduction of the Super SeaCats, Hoverspeed could not match EuroTunnel both in terms of economies of scale and pricing. This became apparent in the company&#x27;s pre-tax profits immediately following the opening of the Channel Tunnel in May 1994.

* End of duty-free sales

Lucrative duty-free sales came to an end in July 1999 when the European Union removed tariffs between members states.

Consequently, Sea Containers announced it refused to support Hoverspeed’s losses on the English Channel and that they would cease operations on the Dover-Calais route, ending over 40 years of service.

=== Company wind-down and sale of assets ===
It was initially thought that both the 81m Seacats would move to Sea Containers Mediterranean services. However in March 2006 both the &quot;Seacat Rapide&quot; and &quot;Seacat Diamant&quot; were put up for sale by Sea Containers. &quot;Superseacat One&quot; which had operated for Hoverspeed on its now-closed Newhaven – Dieppe (2000 and 2002–2004) and Dover – Calais / Ostend (2001) fast ferry services was sold in April 2006 to Acciona Trasmediterránea and was renamed &quot;Almudaina Dos&quot;.

Although the company ended Hovercraft service, they still retained ownership of the remaining 2 SR.N4s until 2006 when they were sold to Wensley Haydon-Baillie. In 2016, following a transfer of ownership of both land and the craft to the Home &amp; Communities Agency, a public campaign was launched to save one or both of the craft.

By summer 2016, it was established that &quot;The Princess Anne&quot; would be saved and refurbished as a permanent exhibit at the Hovercraft Museum. The fate of &quot;The Princess Margaret&quot;, which was not in such sound structural repair, was announced on 30 May 2018 - usable parts will be moved to &quot;The Princess Anne&quot; and the craft will be scrapped.

The closure of Hoverspeed left a single company in the United Kingdom still operating hovercraft flights, Hovertravel.

== Hoverports ==

=== Dover Hoverport ===
Since the closure of Hoverspeed in 2005, the Dover Hoverport had remained unused until SpeedFerries moved to the site from the Eastern Docks. They operated from the hoverport to Boulogne from Easter 2007 until November 2008 when SpeedFerries went into administration and their services ceased. The hoverport site then lay abandoned for the second time in its thirty-year history until demolition of the site began in May 2009 in preparation for the redevelopment of the Western Docks and a new Cruise Terminal.

=== Calais and Boulogne Hoverports ===
Following expansion of Calais port in January 2016, Calais Hoverport was subsequently demolished, only Boulogne (Le Portel) hoverport site remains, albeit long abandoned and derelict.

===Ramsgate Hoverport===

Hoverspeed took on the purpose-built Hoverlloyd site at Pegwell Bay, the Ramsgate Hoverport. Passenger and car services continued during 1982 but were then moved to Dover. Hoverspeed kept the site in use for administration and hovercraft maintenance, including craft overhauls, until 1987.

<doc id="1184127" wikidata="Q3685895" url="?curid=1184127" title="Love, Sidney">
<text>Love, Sidney is an American sitcom television series which aired two seasons on NBC, from October 28, 1981, to June 6, 1983. It stars Tony Randall as Sidney Shorr (a single, closeted gay man), Swoosie Kurtz as Laurie Morgan (a single mother with whom he shares his home), and Kaleena Kiff as Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Morgan (Laurie&#x27;s young daughter). It was the first program on American television to feature a gay person as the central character, although his sexual orientation was carefully downplayed for most of the series&#x27; duration.

The series was based on a short story by Marilyn Cantor Baker, which was adapted as the TV movie &quot;Sidney Shorr: A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, which NBC aired a few weeks before the series premiered. It was produced by Warner Bros. Television.

==Synopsis==
The storyline begins with the television movie &quot;Sidney Shorr: A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Randall plays the title character, a well-to-do gay New Yorker in his 50s, who befriends a single woman, Laurie Morgan (originally played by Lorna Patterson), and Patti, her young daughter. Laurie is an aspiring actress, and at the end of the movie, Sidney is brokenhearted when she and Patti move to California. Patti is played in the later stages of the movie (once time lapses to her being five years old) by Kaleena Kiff, who retains the role in &quot;Love, Sidney&quot;.

With the debut of the series, Laurie Morgan (now played by Swoosie Kurtz) and Patti return to New York, following the failure of Laurie&#x27;s marriage in California. The three characters return to sharing Sidney&#x27;s Manhattan apartment. Laurie has established herself as an actress in commercials and television roles, and resumes her career in New York, appearing as vixen &quot;Gloria Trenell&quot; on the (fictional) daytime soap opera &quot;As Thus We Are&quot;. Sidney continues to be a doting father figure to precocious Patti, whose innocence fills his life with sunshine, and provides him with the child he has never had.

Although it is openly acknowledged in the TV movie that Sidney was gay, and had previously been in a relationship with a man, in the series these facts are not stated directly. Instead his sexual orientation is ambiguous and only hinted at, and the &quot;couple&quot; of Laurie and Sidney behave platonically, with only fleeting displays of affection that might be interpreted as romantic.

Sidney speaks at times about his long deceased mother, consistently referring to her as &quot;that terrible woman&quot;.

The series depicts Sidney&#x27;s career as a professional illustrator; his frequent business deals are made with young ad agency director Jason Stoller (Chip Zien), who works at Graham &amp; Ludwig, Sidney&#x27;s biggest account. Another recurring character in the first season is Sidney&#x27;s friend and neighbor judge Mort Harris (Alan North), who had a dog named &quot;Rehnquist&quot;—named for then–Associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. In the second season, their most prominent neighbor is busybody Mrs. Gaffney (Barbara Bryne), wife of the building&#x27;s superintendent, who seeks to gain Sidney&#x27;s affections. Also added to the cast that season is Nancy (Lynne Thigpen), Jason&#x27;s secretary at Graham &amp; Ludwig.

==Production==
&quot;Sidney Shorr: A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; went into production during 1980. Network executives planned to use it as a pilot, and develop the movie into a weekly series if it was a success in the ratings. However, after the film was complete, NBC continued to postpone its premiere, and by the end of the 1980–81 season it had not yet aired. Meanwhile, the network had decided to produce the series as part of its 1981 Fall schedule, using the movie as an introduction shortly before its debut.

By the time the series was cast, Lorna Patterson was no longer available, as she had already begun starring on CBS&#x27; &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;; Swoosie Kurtz took over the role of Laurie Morgan. Tony Randall, bitter about regular television roles after the cancellation of his last series &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot; (1976–78), was initially uninterested in returning to a television series, but was interested in the &quot;Sidney Shorr&quot; story as a TV movie. Randall agreed to &quot;Love, Sidney&quot; with two conditions. First, it would provide him extra income that would go toward the financing of the national theatre he wanted to open and run in New York City. (The salary he made over the show&#x27;s two seasons eventually paid off when his National Actors Theatre opened at NYC&#x27;s Pace University in 1991.) Secondly, the series had to be taped in New York. During the first season, the series was produced at Reeves Teletape Studios, though the first episode was recorded in Studio 6A at NBC Studios (New York City). Midway through season one, production of &quot;Love, Sidney&quot; was forced to relocate to Los Angeles for seven episodes because the Teletape studios needed to honor a previous commitment to another production. Those seven episodes were recorded at Warner Bros. in Burbank. &quot;Love, Sidney&quot; returned to New York for the remainder of its run, taping in various studios, including the CBS Broadcast Center despite being an NBC series.

When the series was announced, NBC received complaints from the Moral Majority and other special-interest groups who were upset about the network presenting a positive portrayal of homosexuality. The lead character&#x27;s sexuality was kept ambiguous, referred to only in oblique, coded hints. Some TV critics described the character only as a &quot;confirmed bachelor&quot;.

The series proved popular among viewers in New York City, where the series was set, particular with its gay male population. The show was also popular in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. In other markets, however, its ratings ranged from moderately successful to poor.

George Eckstein was the original executive producer from the time of &quot;Love, Sidney&quot;&#x27;s premiere. While the series performed well enough for NBC to warrant it a second season, they pushed for changes in order to improve the show&#x27;s chances for lasting success. At the start of the 1982–83 season, the network hired the veteran producing team of Rod Parker and Hal Cooper to take over the show. With existing producers Ken Hecht and Sandy Veith, they made many changes, including two new regular cast members and a switch to more meaningful, moralized stories which bordered on the &quot;very special episode&quot; format.

The first eight episodes of the second season featured a remixed version of the theme song, sung by Gladys and Bubba Knight. With the November 27, 1982 episode (&quot;Jan, Part 1&quot;), the original version of the theme was reinstated for the title sequence, while the closing credits retained the outro track recorded by the Knights.

As time went on, the writers began to set things up to address Sidney&#x27;s orientation more directly. The addition of the female neighbor Mrs. Gaffney pursuing a sexual relationship with him offered more opportunities to establish that he was not attracted to women.

In a special hour-long episode aired on May 16, 1983, Sidney agrees to date his new co-worker Allison (Martha Smith), but the courtship ends because of Sidney&#x27;s lack of passion. He explains that his heart had been broken by a previous long-time love, and he could never love anyone again. Left alone, Allison tearfully remarks about Sidney&#x27;s former lover: &quot;if only she knew what she was missing&quot;, and the camera pans over to a framed photograph of Sidney&#x27;s former lover Martin, from the pilot movie.

The following episode, the next-to-last in the series, has an openly gay guest character: a psychiatrist who befriends Sidney after the latter talks him out of suicide.

The series was not renewed for a third season.

<doc id="1184129" wikidata="Q5357470" url="?curid=1184129" title="Electric Railway Museum">
<text>The Electric Railway Museum (formerly the Coventry Railway Centre) was located in Warwickshire, south-east of Coventry, near the village of Baginton. The heritage railway centre was immediately adjacent to Coventry Airport and so it was also known as &quot;The Airfield Line&quot;. The site was managed by the Electric Railway Museum Limited, and was home to a sizeable collection of preserved electric multiple units (EMUs), which was the most diverse and historically significant collection of EMUs in the UK, containing unique items that are the last survivors of once typical and numerous classes. In addition, there were small industrial electric locomotives, two small industrial diesel locomotives, and one small industrial petrol locomotive, along with some other railway vehicles, which are owned by third parties. The land was leased from Coventry City Council, though it is located just outside the city boundary and is in the county of Warwickshire.

On 9 July 2017, it was announced that, owing to the site being sold for development, the museum would close on 8 October 2017 (the last open day of the year). The site was cleared by the end of July 2018 and all railway items and heritage buildings found new homes.

==History==

===Coventry Steam Railway Centre===
The site was originally established as the Coventry Steam Railway Centre in 1986 by a group who set out to preserve Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0 tank locomotive number 1857. The group established the site and located the locomotive and other collected items of motive power, rolling stock and infrastructure, including Little Bowden Junction Midland Railway Signal Box there. The land was previously used as part of the municipal water treatment works and there had never been any railway infrastructure there until the creation of the Centre.

===Suburban Electric Railway Association===
With a small membership, progress was slow and by the mid-1990s had slowed nearly to a halt. The late nineties saw one of the original founders retire due to ill health and he sold his interest in the site to a consortium of Suburban Electric Railway Association (SERA) members, except the tank engine which was sold to another railway. By 2004, the other founders had left and SERA took over sole running of the site.

===Electric Railway Museum===
In 2009, the responsibility of managing the site passed to Electric Railway Museum Limited, a charitable company which had been established in 2007 to create a permanent home for preserving and representing Britain&#x27;s electric railway heritage. With this development, the original Coventry Railway Centre Limited company was wound up and its assets passed to Electric Railway Museum Limited. The site was open to the public, and group and individual visits could be admitted by prior booking. The first Chairman was Graeme Gleaves and the museum held its first public open day in September 2010. In 2011 the ERM won the Heritage Railway Association Best Small Group award.

==Track layout==
The track layout comprised two three road fans of sidings. Those at the end of the site adjacent to the Midlands Air Museum were complete with a headshunt that ran through a 40-metre cutting that was excavated by the members of the original steam centre in the early nineties. The sidings nearest Rowley Road were unconnected. The sidings were protected by an inner fence to create a secure compound.

==Facilities==
Other improvements made to the site by Electric Railway Museum in late 2009 included the provision of mains electricity on site and state-of-the-art CCTV equipment.

==Stock==
The vast majority of items not being actively restored were sheeted over to protect them from rusting, vandalism, and other damage.

==Gallery==
==Closure==
On 9 July 2017, it was announced that, owing to the site being sold for development, the museum would close on 8 October 2017 (the last open day of the year). The future of the museum and its collection of unique electric multiple units and other items was uncertain at that time, with efforts to raise £10,000 underway to cover the costs of moving the stock to an as yet unknown location. Ruston &amp; Hornsby 88 diesel shunter, nicknamed &quot;Crabtree&quot;, and BR Class 309 unit 960 101 were moved to the Tanat Valley Light Railway in May 2018 with the EMU to serve as a static museum and buffet train at Nantmawr.

<doc id="1184147" wikidata="Q4596423" url="?curid=1184147" title="1st Parliament of Ontario">
<text>The 1st Parliament of Ontario was in session from September 3, 1867, until February 25, 1871, just prior to the 1871 general election. This was the first session of the Legislature after Confederation succeeding the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada (last session was the 8th Parliament of the Province of Canada). 

The 1867 general election produced a virtual tie between the Conservative Party led by John Sandfield Macdonald and the Liberal Party led informally by Archibald McKellar. Macdonald ended up securing the Premiership by leading a coalition government with the support of moderate Liberals. His Cabinet, nicknamed the Patent Combination, included two conservatives (John Carling and Matthew Crooks Cameron), a coalition Grit (Edmund Burke Wood) and two old school Baldwinite Reformers (Sandfield Macdonald himself and Stephen Richards). The first ministry would survive the first parliament by less than a year, resigning in December 1871.

In the first several years of Confederation, individuals could be elected to both federal and provincial parliaments and serve as MPs and MPPs at the same time. In the first Parliament of Ontario, provincial cabinet ministers John Sandfield Macdonald, Edmund Burke Wood, and John Carling all sat in both parliaments, as did Edward Blake, Thomas Roberts Ferguson, John Lorn McDougall (after 1869) and Frederick William Cumberland (after 1871). Generally, they represented the same riding, but it was not necessarily so; for example, Edward Blake represented Bruce South in the provincial parliament but Durham West at the federal level.

John Stevenson served as speaker for the assembly.

Below is a list of members of Ontario&#x27;s first parliament. Bolded names are cabinet ministers; Capitalized names also sat in federal parliament.

<text>Suvla () is a bay on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli peninsula in European Turkey, south of the Gulf of Saros.

On 6 August 1915, it was the site for the Landing at Suvla Bay by the British IX Corps as part of the August Offensive during the Battle of Gallipoli. The landing and others at various points along the peninsula were designed to capture the peninsula from Turkish troops defending it, and to open the Dardanelles Straits to Allied warships, thus facilitating a planned naval attack on Constantinople (Istanbul). The Gallipoli campaign ended in failure and high casualties for the Allied side, which included numbers of Australian, New Zealand, Indian, Irish, French, and Newfoundland troops.

The area is notable for viticulture and winemaking. The well-known wine producer &quot;Suvla&quot; is located here.

== Popular references ==
* Suvla is mentioned in the Irish Rebel song &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;, second verse: &quot;It was better to die &#x27;neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sedd el Bahr&quot;, and third verse: &quot;But their lonely graves are by Suvla&#x27;s waves or the fringe of the Great North Sea&quot;.
* Suvla Bay also features in &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot;, the oft-covered song by Eric Bogle.
* &quot;Suvla Bay&quot; was a popular Australian song (composer unidentified) in 1949, and was recorded by artists like Reg Lindsey, Ray Kernaghan, Frank Ifield and Slim Dusty.
* Suvla is also mentioned in the song &quot;The Connaught Rangers&quot;: &quot;At Suvla and at Sud el Bar, we fought your every bloody war...&quot;
* Suvla is also mentioned in the traditional Newfoundland song &quot;Recruiting Sergeant&quot;: &quot;And on the sands of Suvla, they entered into hell&quot;
* &quot;The Bay of Suvla&quot; is a song performed by Canadian folk-punk band The Dreadnoughts, released November 11th, 2017, as a tribute to World War One.

<text>Sedd el Bahr (, , meaning &quot;Walls of the Sea&quot;) is a village in the Eceabat District, Çanakkale Province, Turkey. It is located at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey. The village lies east of the cape, on the shore of the Dardanelles. It was the site of V Beach, the landing zone for two Irish battalions, including one from the SS &quot;River Clyde&quot;, on 25 April 1915 during the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Its population is 277 (2021).

At the tip of the Sedd el Bahr promontory is the castle (&quot;Sedd el Bahr Kale&quot;), also known as Old Castle (&quot;Eski Kale&quot;), which was built in 1659. The British designated the castle &quot;Fort No. 3&quot; (at the other end of V Beach was &quot;Fort No. 1&quot;, also known as Fort Ertuğrul) and it was equipped with ten artillery pieces, including two 28 cm Krupp L/22 guns. The castle was bombarded by the Royal Navy on 3 November 1914, causing serious damage and killing 86 Ottoman soldiers.

The British attacked the Ottoman forts on 19 February 1915 at the start of the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. Sedd el Bahr was subjected to repeated bombardment and raids by naval demolition teams and the position was deemed too exposed. By the peak of naval operations on 18 March, Sedd el Bahr and Kum Kale, across the straits, had been eliminated as threats.

Sedd el Bahr is mentioned in the traditional Irish song &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; in the line &quot;It was better to die &#x27;neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud al bar&quot;. This line references the 1916 Easter Rising, which took place in Ireland around a year after the landing at Suvla Bay as part of the Gallipoli Campaign.

<doc id="1184163" wikidata="Q412850" url="?curid=1184163" title="Factor VII">
<text>Coagulation factor VII (, formerly known as proconvertin) is a protein involved in coagulation and, in humans, is encoded by gene &quot;F7&quot;. It is an enzyme of the serine protease class. Once bound to tissue factor released from damaged tissues, it is converted to factor VIIa (or &quot;blood-coagulation factor VIIa&quot;, &quot;activated blood coagulation factor VII&quot;), which in turn activates factor IX and factor X.

Using genetic recombination a recombinant factor VIIa (eptacog alfa) (trade names include NovoSeven) has been approved by the FDA for the control of bleeding in hemophilia. It is sometimes used unlicensed in severe uncontrollable bleeding, although there have been safety concerns. A biosimilar form of recombinant activated factor VII (AryoSeven) is also available, but does not play any considerable role in the market.

In April 2020, the US FDA approved a new rFVIIa product, eptacog beta (SEVENFACT), the first bypassing agent (BPA) approved in more than 2 decades. As an rFVIIa product, eptacog beta works in a complex with tissue factor to activate factor X to Xa, thereby bypassing FVIII and FIX. The activation of Factor X to Xa initiates the coagulation cascade’s common pathway, leading to clot formation at the site of hemorrhage. Activated FVII binds to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which enhances hemostasis.14 One study showed that eptacog beta binds to EPCR with 25% to 30% more affinity than eptacog alfa, displacing protein C from EPCR binding sites and downregulating activated protein C generation, contributing to its hemostatic effect.

== Physiology ==

The main role of factor VII (FVII) is to initiate the process of coagulation in conjunction with tissue factor (TF/factor III). Tissue factor is found on the outside of blood vessels - normally not exposed to the bloodstream. Upon vessel injury, tissue factor is exposed to the blood and circulating factor VII. Once bound to TF, FVII is activated to FVIIa by different proteases, among which are thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, IXa, XIIa, and the FVIIa-TF complex itself. The complex of factor VIIa with TF catalyzes the conversion of factor IX and factor X into the active proteases, factor IXa and factor Xa, respectively.

The action of the factor is impeded by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is released almost immediately after initiation of coagulation. Factor VII, which was discovered around 1950, is vitamin K-dependent and produced in the liver. Use of warfarin or similar anticoagulants decreases hepatic synthesis of FVII.

A coagulation enzyme cascade may begin with a few molecules of factor XII and culminate in the activation of millions of times more fibrin molecules.

== Structure ==

Factor VII shares a common domain architecture with factors IX and X.

== Genetics ==

The gene for factor VII is located on chromosome 13 (13q34).

== Role in disease ==

Factor VII deficiency (congenital proconvertin deficiency) is rare and inherited recessively. It presents as a hemophilia-like bleeding disorder. It is treated with recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven or AryoSeven). Gene therapy approaches for treating FVII deficiency are very promising ()

== Medical uses ==

Recombinant factor VIIa, marketed under the trade names &quot;AryoSeven&quot; and &quot;NovoSeven&quot;, is used for people with hemophilia (with Factor VIII or IX deficiency) who have developed antibodies against replacement coagulation factor.

It has also been used in the setting of uncontrollable hemorrhage, but its role in this setting is controversial with insufficient evidence to support its use outside of clinical trials. The first report of its use in hemorrhage was in an Israeli soldier with uncontrollable bleeding in 1999. Risks of its use include an increase in arterial thrombosis. However, animal studies have not shown complications as seen in humans, in fact same of the studies show a better prognosis. In the military settings it is used as an off label intervention in complications related to disseminated intravascular coagulation related haemorrhage caused by penetrating trauma.

Recombinant human factor VII while initially looking promising in intracerebral hemorrhage failed to show benefit following further study and this is no longer recommended.

== Interactions ==

Factor VII has been shown to interact with tissue factor and endothelial protein C receptor.

<doc id="1184167" wikidata="Q548303" url="?curid=1184167" title="The Tailor of Panama (film)">
<text>The Tailor of Panama is a 2001 spy thriller film directed by John Boorman from a screenplay he co-wrote with John le Carré and Andrew Davies. Based on le Carré&#x27;s 1996 novel of the same name, it stars Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush. Rush portrays the title character, a former convict turned tailor who is strong-armed by an amoral MI6 agent (Brosnan) into spying on the Panamanian government. Jamie Lee Curtis, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine McCormack, Leonor Varela and Harold Pinter co-star, along with Daniel Radcliffe in his film debut.

The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on 11 February 2001, and was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures on 30 March. It received positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Brosnan and Rush, and grossed $28 million on a $21 million budget.

== Plot ==
Andy Osnard is an MI6 agent reassigned to Panama after having an affair in Madrid with the foreign minister&#x27;s mistress. His superior warns him of the corruption present in Panama, but Osnard views that as an opportunity. Consulting a list of British expatriates residing in Panama, he meets Harry Pendel, the tailor to many of the country&#x27;s elite. Pendel, a gifted storyteller, passes himself off as being formerly of Savile Row, but is in fact an ex-con who used to run scams with his late uncle Benny. Pendel&#x27;s American wife Louisa, the assistant to the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, is unaware of his criminal record. While Harry is a superb tailor, he is a bad businessman; his tailor shop is constantly in debt, and he owes $50,000 of Louisa&#x27;s money to the bank for a failed farming business.

Knowing that Pendel needs money, Osnard offers to help him if Pendel feeds him information about the elite of Panama City. Pendel agrees and uses the money to pay off his debts and help his friend Mickie, a down-on-his-luck alcoholic, and his assistant Marta, who was raped and disfigured by Manuel Noriega&#x27;s soldiers. However, Osnard soon requires better information, threatening to cut off the money and reveal that Pendel has been spying for a foreign government if he does not get what he wants.

Pendel starts &quot;tailoring&quot; his stories, escalating the roles of friends to make them appear more significant than they are. He casts Mickie as a revolutionary who still holds sway over the youth of Panama, and his shop manager as the leader of an opposition movement. After fixing the suit of the president of Panama (whose conversation consisted of his suit being too tight), he comes up with a tale that the president intends to sell the Panama Canal to China. When an incredulous Osnard asks which, Beijing or Taiwan, Pendel replies &quot;both.&quot; Osnard knows that Pendel is making up these stories but does not care as long as his superiors believe them.

As Osnard passes along this misinformation (bypassing the embassy staff, apart from Francesca, a staffer he is sleeping with), it makes its way to Washington, where military and government officials are alarmed and plan an invasion to prevent the canal from falling into Chinese hands. Pendel, meanwhile, seeks to end his spying, saying the opposition won&#x27;t listen to him because it needs $10 million. He thinks the figure will put Osnard off, but Osnard relays a request to fund the opposition as a means to control Panama after this supposed revolution; he asks for $&quot;15&quot; million, which is granted by the Pentagon. Osnard&#x27;s superior arrives with a briefcase containing the money, ready to meet with the opposition, while American attack helicopters are preparing for an assault on the capital.

The British ambassador uncovers what Osnard has been up to and threatens to reveal everything. Osnard pays for his silence and cooperation with $1.25 million. He manages to ditch his superior and make off with the briefcase. Meanwhile, Pendel gets a call from Marta, who tells him that Mickie has committed suicide out of fear that he would go to prison for his supposed revolutionary ties. Pendel blames himself for Mickie&#x27;s death and resolves to thwart Osnard&#x27;s plans. He waylays Osnard as he flees to the airport, but Osnard gives him the slip.

Louisa, who has to fight off Osnard after she goes to investigate him and he attempts to rape her, finds out what Pendel has been doing and races to the Administrator&#x27;s office. The Administrator contacts the president, who is able to contact the U.S. government and have the invasion called off shortly after it began. During the confusion, Osnard goes to the airport, where he meets the ambassador and hands him his bribe. The ambassador allows Osnard to get on an airplane. Pendel returns home to Louisa and tells her about his criminal past, and she forgives him. Osnard, meanwhile, escapes the country with the money.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
&quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; was shot at the Ardmore Studios in County Wicklow, Ireland, and on location in Panama City, Lake Gatun and Gamboa, Panama. It was produced by Boorman&#x27;s Irish production company Merlin Films, with financial support from Columbia Pictures.

Like the novel, the film is inspired by Graham Greene&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, which depicts intelligence agencies believing reports from local informants in Cuba. Whereas the novel was set in the 1990s, before the American withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone, the film moves the time period to the 21st century.

In the original ending of the film, Osnard is shot by Pendel. This was changed to allow Osnard to escape.

== Reception ==
The film holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.80/10 based on 118 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; is a smart, darkly satirical thriller with exuberant performances from Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="1184168" wikidata="Q2434337" url="?curid=1184168" title="Tim Valentine">
<text>Itimous Thaddeus &quot;Tim&quot; Valentine Jr. (March 15, 1926 – November 10, 2015) was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina from 1983 to 1995.

==Early life==
Valentine was born on March 15, 1926, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and attended public schools. His father, also named Itimous and known by that name (he was one of several brothers with unusual names of unknown origin), was a State Supreme Court justice. His mother, the former Hazel Armstrong, was a postmistress. His uncle was United States Air Force Lieutenant General Frank A. Armstrong.

During World War II, Valentine joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and served on active duty from 1944 to 1946.

Valentine graduated from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1948, and graduated from the law school of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1952, being admitted to the North Carolina bar that same year. He practiced law with a firm bearing his family name in Nashville.

==Political career==

Valentine served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1955 to 1960. Thereafter, he was an advisor and counsel to Governor Dan K. Moore and later chaired the executive committee of the North Carolina Democratic Party (1966–1968). He was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

In 1982, Valentine was elected to Congress from North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and served six terms in the House of Representatives. He did not stand for re-election in 1994 and retired from elected office when his term expired in January 1995. A portion of U.S. 64 near Nashville is named for him in recognition of his public service.

==Personal life==
Valentine was survived by Barbara Reynolds, four children from his first marriage to Betsy, including talk radio host Phil Valentine; three stepchildren; nine grandchildren; five step-grandchildren; and a step-great-grandson.

Valentine died at his home in Nashville on November 10, 2015, from heart failure at the age of 89. His death came one week after the death of a Republican former colleague, Howard Coble of North Carolina&#x27;s 6th congressional district.

<doc id="1184176" wikidata="Q781567" url="?curid=1184176" title="Australian League of Rights">
<text>The Australian League of Rights is a far-right and antisemitic political organisation in Australia. It was founded in Adelaide, South Australia, by Eric Butler in 1946, and organised nationally in 1960. It inspired groups like the Canadian League of Rights (1968), the New Zealand League of Rights (1970) and the British League of Rights (1971), with principles based on the economic theory of Social credit expounded by C. H. Douglas. The League describes itself as upholding the virtues of freedom, with stated values of &quot;loyalty to God, Queen and Country&quot;.

In 1972, Butler created an umbrella group, the Crown Commonwealth League of Rights, to represent these four groups, and which also served as a chapter of the World League for Freedom and Democracy.

==History==
The League was formed in South Australia in 1946, with the national organisation being launched in 1960. The League formed offshoots in the white dominions: namely, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. In 1972, Butler created an umbrella group, the Crown Commonwealth League of Rights, to represent these four groups; which also served as a chapter of the World Anti-Communist League. It was also linked with far right groups in the United States such as the John Birch Society. The first Crown Commonwealth League of Rights conference was held in Melbourne in 1979.

Veritas is the publishing company of the League, which publishes a weekly newsletter called &quot;On Target&quot;.

==Political views and ideology==
From the start, the League has described itself as being based on the principles of Christianity. It is anti-communist and anti-World Government. Its defend a distributive political economy, based on social credit, a form of socialism. They are monarchist and opposed to Australian republicanism and see strong relations with Great Britain as fundamental to Australian identity.

The League has been described as neo-Nazi in various sources although at least one writer differentiated it from neo-Nazi groups saying that unlike such groups, the League &quot;under the leadership of Eric Butler, sought to maintain a veneer of respectability...&quot; while using its publications to promote &quot;the crudest forms of anti-Semitism... Butler&#x27;s The International Jew presented the argument that &quot;Hitler&#x27;s policy was a Jewish policy&quot;. The Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) released a report on October 5, 2022, in which it classified the Australian League of Rights as a &quot;conspiracy,&quot; &quot;antisemitism,&quot; and &quot;white nationalist&quot; group.

In &quot;Faces of hate: hate crime in Australia&quot;, David Greason wrote: &quot;The League is not Nazi, yet its propaganda themes are similar in many ways to those used in Nazi Germany 60 years ago. The League refuses to acknowledge any similarities with neo-Nazi organisations, and either points to its philosophical opposition to the centralisation of power, or claims that neo-Nazi organisations are created by powerful Jewish organisations to discredit patriotic groups. In fact, the League has always had a relationship of sorts with such groups. They read the same books, cite the same authorities, and blame the same scapegoats. The nuances of any anti-centralist philosophy are invariably lost on the average neo-Nazi&quot;.

===Antisemitism===

Andrew Moore has cited antisemitism as the &quot;touchstone of the League&#x27;s ideology&quot;, although the League has in the past characterised antisemitism as &quot;a political swear word used to criticise those who do not agree with Zionist policies&quot;. The League has described the Holocaust as the &quot;alleged Holocaust&quot; and the &quot;Holocaust Hoax&quot;. Its founder, Eric Butler, was well known for his antisemitism and support of such documents as the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a well-known antisemitic hoax. The historian Andrew Markus wrote that &quot;In the 1990s league publications were still promoting The Protocols, describing the Holocaust as a &#x27;hoax&#x27;, the invention of Zionist propagandists, identifying prominent Jews in public life and declaring that modern Christianity was &#x27;little more than a form of Liberal Judaism&#x27;. The Jewish plot was also described using various code words, notably the &#x27;one world conspiracy&#x27; hatched by &#x27;international elites&#x27;, international bureaucracies, international bankers, members of the Fabian Society, or the United Nations.&quot;.

The League supported Holocaust denier David Irving and assisted his visits to Australia; Veritas published Irving&#x27;s work in Australia.

===Opposition to liberal democracy===
The league is opposed to liberal democracy, the party system and the processes of parliamentary democracy. However, the league has tried to use entryism or support various political parties and community or social groups.

Butler in his book &quot;The Money Power versus Democracy&quot; (1940) stated &quot;The Party system of Government can play little part, if any, in the struggle for real democracy. In principle, it is the antithesis of democracy.&quot;

C. H. Douglas regarded the party system as a &quot;criminal absurdity&quot; and argued for the end of the secret ballot. He believed that with the implementation of social credit, party politics would end.

==Connections to political parties==
In the early 1970s, the League attempted to gain control of the National Party of Australia, encouraging members to join the party in sufficient numbers to take control, a tactic known as entryism. Doug Anthony, who had recently become the Nationals&#x27; leader, led an effort to defend the party from the League by recruiting people whom he could rely upon to vote against League candidates. After a struggle lasting several years, Anthony&#x27;s forces prevailed. A consequence of this struggle was that the National Party had more members than either of the Labor or Liberal parties, despite always getting a fraction of the electoral support which the other two parties obtained. This fact became much more widely known than the reason for it, both sides having kept the struggle out of the media.

Many years later various League members offered support to the One Nation party.

Former Western Australian Labor MP, founder of the Australia First Party and later One Nation member Graeme Campbell was associated with the league at the same time as he was a member of One Nation and Australia First. In 2001 Campbell stated that &quot;Australia First has no association with the League. It&#x27;s me with the association.&quot;

During 1987, Liberal MP Alexander Downer made an address to the League, a fact which was not made publicly known until seven years afterwards, when Downer had become his party&#x27;s leader; he was apparently unaware of the League&#x27;s history at the time he made the speech. It was one of Downer&#x27;s many mistakes that would ultimately see him step down from the leadership in 1995.

Then treasurer Peter Costello, in 1998, stated that One Nation&#x27;s policy of a state bank which would issue low-interest loans was directly taken from the League, and that &quot;the League of Rights is driving its policy in relation to banking and money&quot;.

==Connections to other groups==
The League operates, and has operated, a number of front organisations such as the Institute of Economic Democracy, the Christian Institute of Individual Freedom, and the Australian Heritage Society.

During the 1960s and 1970s, some members of the League were also involved with the Rhodesia-Australia Association. This led to tensions within the Rhodesia-Australia Association.

The league has been linked with Australians Against Further Immigration (AAFI). Franca Arena raised a question in the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1994 about the links between the AAFI and the &quot;notorious and dangerous League of Rights, which has been described as the most influential, effective, best organised and most substantially financed racist organisation in Australia&quot;. She questioned whether the AAFI was just a front for the League.

In 1998, the Australian branch of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Anti-Defamation Commission issued a press release that &quot;The Co-founder of Australians Against Further Immigration (AAFI), and One Nation&#x27;s Victorian leader Robyn Spencer has addressed numerous League of Rights meetings as well as delivered a speech with League of Rights, Advisory National Director Eric Butler.&quot;

<text>Oleander is a post-grunge band from Sacramento, California, US. Its name is derived from the poisonous flowering shrub oleander, which line the highways of Northern California. In their nine years of activity, the band released four studio albums under various record labels. Their most successful effort, 1999&#x27;s &quot;February Son&quot;, includes the hit single &quot;Why I&#x27;m Here.&quot; Oleander went on official hiatus after the release and promotion of their third album, &quot;Joyride&quot;, in 2004. The band took some time off, but reunited in 2008, and began work on their album &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;, which was released on April 16, 2013.

==Career==

===1995–2004===
In 1989, singer and guitarist Thomas Flowers met bassist Doug Eldridge; both of whom were employees of a Sacramento eatery. They played with several local bands together before meeting guitarist Ric Ivanisevich who joined them in a rehearsal. Chuck Combs the original drummer left, leaving the position to Fred Nelson Jr, a co-worker of Flowers&#x27; and Eldridge&#x27;s. The quartet formed Oleander in 1995 and soon released an eponymous EP on the indie label Fine Records. This would be followed by a full-length album, &quot;Shrinking the Blob&quot;, in 1997.

The band then gave their CD to a friend who worked at 98-Rock KRXQ who began playing two of their songs on air. The track &quot;Down When I&#x27;m Loaded&quot; gradually became a regional hit, and after opening for Sugar Ray, Oleander was approached by a representative of Republic Records. Soon after, they signed with Universal and began re-recording their 1997 studio album.

During this time, session drummer Jonathan Mover was recruited in the studio to record a new album and play live for the first leg of that tour. Nelson later joined the tour but subsequently left the band and was replaced with Scott Devours. In 1999, Oleander released their major label debut titled &quot;February Son&quot;. The album featured the hit singles &quot;Why I&#x27;m Here&quot; and &quot;I Walk Alone.&quot; The former was even featured in the popular TV series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. In promotion of the album, Oleander also participated in Woodstock &#x27;99 and their music was featured in &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. The American Forces Radio Network in Asia and Europe also quickly jumped on &quot;February Son&quot;, which led to a following overseas.

Oleander recorded a cover of &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; for &quot;Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors&quot;, a tribute album released in November 2000.

The band released their second official album, &quot;Unwind&quot;, in 2001. Their major label sophomore effort included the hit song &quot;Are You There?&quot;. &quot;Champion&quot; became a theme about the sacrifice of firefighters during the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City. The profits made off its single would be donated to aid the victims. During this time, the song &quot;Bruised&quot; was featured exclusively in &quot;American Pie 2&quot;. &quot;Jimmy Shaker Day&quot; was featured in the 2002 blockbuster &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. &quot;Unwind&quot; found considerable success but could not match the popularity of the band&#x27;s previous album. It also gained both criticism and praise for its more varied musical style.

In 2002, Oleander parted ways with Universal and moved to Sanctuary. Their song &quot;Runaway Train&quot; was featured in the Showtime film &quot;Bang Bang You&#x27;re Dead&quot; in November that year. A music video was then shot and incorporated footage from the movie, which led to the &quot;Runaway Train EP&quot;. By March 2003, Oleander released their third major label album, &quot;Joyride&quot;. Considered a return to the straight forward, hard rock approach, the album featured the marginally popular single &quot;Hands Off the Wheel.&quot; Oleander traveled to Vicenza, Italy in March and headlined a special welcome home concert for the 173rd Airborne Brigade.

In November, 2003, drummer Devours issued a statement announcing he was leaving Oleander to join the band Ima Robot. The decision was amicable and, in 2004, the band went into an unofficial hiatus. During that time, vocalist Thomas Flowers co-founded the band Black Summer Crush with Rival Sons guitarist Scott Holiday and drummer, J. Harley Gilmore. Flowers later told Alternative Addiction, &quot;We toured relentlessly, we had done anything that was ever asked of us and more by the record labels, and the payoff was diminishing. So we made a conscious decision to get back to normal life.&quot;

===2008–present===
On May 21, 2008, an official Oleander Myspace was created. On August 6 of that year, it was reported that Black Summer Crush had parted ways with vocalist Thomas Flowers, immediately stirring rumor that Flowers might reunite with his former Oleander bandmates. The official Myspace page also revealed a band lineup including drummer Steve Brown (who had previously played with the band Jet Red), and links to OleanderForums.net, a small, fan-run site claiming that the group was indeed reunited and working on a new album.

In April 2009 Facebook and Twitter accounts were created for Oleander, and new information was brought forth regarding the band&#x27;s alleged reuniting; on AlternativeAddiction.com, Thomas Flowers revealed that by late 2008, he began writing new songs for Oleander and finally got the group together for rehearsal. &quot;I just picked up a guitar and started thinking about the guys, and the places we’ve been and the people we’ve met, and the music that we left behind. There was just so much left that I wanted to say and that I wanted to write.&quot; Regarding the new material&#x27;s style, he also elaborated that it will &quot;retain all the elements of Oleander’s musical past&quot; but also reflect the band &quot;where [they] are today, both lyrically, melodically, and sonically.&quot; Flowers also expressed his desire to finish the record, which was funded entirely by the band, before touring despite various offers.

Oleander took to the stage on August 21, 2010 at The Boardwalk in Orangevale California. Soon after, Flowers announced hopes to release the band&#x27;s new album by spring 2011 under a major label and with a supporting US tour to follow. Oleander also leaked its first single, &quot;Daylight,&quot; to radio stations during this time.

In March 2011, Richard Mouser, who also produced &quot;Shrinking the Blob&quot; and &quot;Unwind&quot;, started mixing the new record.

The new single called &quot;Fight&quot; was to be released November, 2011. An instrumental version was used in official videos for THQ&#x27;s WWE &#x27;12 video game and served as the official theme song of the game. On November 18, 2011 Oleander performed in front of Madison Square Garden live as a part of the WWE&#x27;s pre Survivor Series party which promoted the subsequent release of WWE 12.

In 2012 Oleander signed with Carved Records to release their album &#x27;Something Beautiful&#x27; which contained promo singles &quot;Daylight&quot; and &quot;Fight!&quot; and their newest single &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;. Pre-sale for the album began on March 26, and the album was released on April 16, 2013, with a release party that took place at Ace of Spades in Sacramento, California.

<doc id="1184195" wikidata="Q7988898" url="?curid=1184195" title="Westholme School">
<text>Westholme School is a coeducational private school in Blackburn, Lancashire, England.

Founded in 1923, the school educates boys and girls aged 4 to 18 years. The school became fully coeducational in 2018.

Paul Taylor became the principal in September 2024.

== History ==
Westholme School was founded in Blackburn, Lancashire, England by Emily Singleton on 19 April 1923. Originally from Blackburn, Singleton decided to form a small primary school during the Great Depression due to a perceived lack of alternatives in the local area. She began by offering space and education to a small group of local children in her parents&#x27; house, Westholme, located on Preston New Road in Blackburn.

By 1948, the school had increased enrollment to around 135 pupils and was officially recognized by the government as a formal place of education. This growth led to the formation of a secondary school and a move to larger premises. As Singleton approached retirement age, she sought a new owner who could continue her work at the school. She reached an agreement with World War I veteran Mr. Arthur Rouse, who became the new school principal, joining from the University of Salford.

In 1968, the school became a charity administered by a board of governors, and a sixth form was established along with a ten-acre site-building program that included an assembly hall, laboratories, a swimming pool, a sports hall, playing fields, a music centre, and art studios. The school then consisted of a primary school, secondary school, and sixth form, based at separate locations.
The school&#x27;s expansion continued in the late 1990s under a new principal, Lillian Croston. New facilities and extensions were built, and each location was modernized.

Mrs. Croston led the school for 25 years before retiring in 2013, and Mrs. Lynne Horner became principal of the school in September 2013. In January 2021, Dr. Richard Robson became principal as the school approached its centenary year. As of October 2024, Mr. Paul Taylor is the current principal.

== Present day ==
Westholme became fully coeducational in September 2018 and currently accepts children between the ages of 3 and 18 years. Currently, over 700 girls and boys attend the school from areas throughout Lancashire.

The school is independently run and charges tuition fees. Scholarships are available to pupils in various areas at the discretion of the principal for entry into Year 3, Year 7, and Year 12. Bursaries can be applied for before entry into Year 7 and Year 12, in line with the school&#x27;s charitable status. The value of the Bursary is related to the financial resources of the student&#x27;s family and the school&#x27;s available funds.

The Infant and Junior schools, previously located in Billinge House and Beardwood Bank, were relocated to a new modern prep school that opened in September 2022 and is now on the same site as the Senior School and Sixth Form campus situated at Wilmar Lodge.

== Sports and extracurricular activities ==
Westholme School offers sports including football, rugby, cricket, hockey, netball, cross-country, and swimming. Students use on-site facilities and local amenities such as the athletics track at Witton Park and cricket grounds at Cherry Tree Cricket Club.

Facilities include:

Indoor

* Sports Hall, including cricket nets
* 20m swimming pool and baby pool
* Fitness suite
* Dance studio

Outdoor

* Full-size synthetic hockey pitch
* Football pitches
* Rugby pitch
* Tennis/netball hard courts
* Grass athletics track
* Onsite cross-country course

The school promotes inter-house competitions where students compete against each other throughout the year at events such as Sports Days, swimming galas, and music and reading competitions. Music and drama programs are also offered, with teaching and productions in multipurpose facilities on the school campus. Theatrical productions take place every year at the school and often involve the cooperation of the school orchestra. Past productions include &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot;, &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. For the last 20 years, members of the school choir have undertaken a performing tour during the summer holidays and have performed in different international locations, including Salzburg, New York, Monte Carlo, and Paris.

Westholme partners with several sports clubs and local organizations, including Accrington Stanley FC, Blackburn Rovers FC, Preston Grasshoppers RFC, Blackburn Rugby Club, and Blackburn Cathedral, where the schools carol services are held annually.
