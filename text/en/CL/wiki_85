<text>The Hunting Act 2004 (c. 37) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which bans the hunting of most wild mammals (notably foxes, deer, hares and mink) with dogs in England and Wales, subject to some strictly limited exemptions; the Act does not cover the use of dogs in the process of flushing out an unidentified wild mammal, nor does it affect drag hunting, where hounds are trained to follow an artificial scent.

The Act came into force on 18 February 2005. The pursuit of foxes with hounds, other than to flush out to be shot, had been banned in Scotland two years earlier by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. Such hunting remains permitted by the law in Northern Ireland, where the Act does not apply.

==History==

===Background===

Several UK laws on animal welfare, such as the Protection of Animals Act 1911, the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 contained specific exemptions for hunting activities, thereby preventing prosecutions of other hunts activities that might otherwise have been considered cruel.

Many earlier attempts had been made to ban hunting. Two private member&#x27;s bills to ban, or restrict, hunting were introduced in 1949, but one was withdrawn and the other defeated on its second reading in the House of Commons. The Labour government appointed a Select Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals, chaired by John Scott-Henderson KC, to investigate all forms of hunting, and it published a report in 1951. Opponents of hunting claimed that the membership of the committee had been chosen to produce a pro-hunting report. The inquiry reported its view that &quot;Fox hunting makes a very important contribution to the control of foxes and involves less cruelty than most other methods of controlling them. It should therefore be allowed to continue.&quot; The select committee was unanimous in recommending no action on hunting, but it made proposals on the use of spring traps.

Twice, in 1969 and in 1975, the House of Commons voted in favour of bills to ban hare coursing, but neither bill became law. Three further private member&#x27;s bills were introduced by Kevin McNamara in 1992 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill), by Tony Banks in 1993 (Fox Hunting (Abolition) Bill), and by John McFall in 1995 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill)—all of which failed to go on to become law.

The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 made it unlawful to chase or deliberately kill mammals with dogs in 2002. There are a number of differences between the two Acts: The Scottish Act does not place a two dog limit on the flushing of a mammal to guns in order to shoot it; with respect to flushing foxes above ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect game birds; with respect to flushing foxes below ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect livestock. The Scottish Act allows someone convicted to be sentenced for up to six months in prison, there is no such power in the Hunting Act 2004.

At the time of this bill fox hunting with hounds was &quot;not practised or is largely banned&quot; in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden, but was allowed in Australia, Canada, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Russia and the USA.

===Drafting===
The Labour Party came to power in 1997 with a manifesto saying, &quot;We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned.&quot; A new private member&#x27;s bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting &quot;seriously compromise the welfare of the fox&quot;, but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that &quot;Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area.&quot; Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an &#x27;options bill&#x27; which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.

In what he described as an attempt to raise animal welfare standards at the same time, and as an alternative to legislation that specifically targeted hunting, Lord Donoughue proposed the Wild Mammals (Protection) (Amendment) Bill. This would have made it the case that &quot;any person who intentionally inflicts, or causes or procures, unnecessary suffering on or to any wild mammal shall be guilty of an offence.&quot; A matching Bill was introduced in the Commons with the support of The Middle Way Group (see below). Both bills failed to become law as they were blocked by Labour members who wanted a specific hunting ban. Animal welfare groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports criticised the Bill on two grounds. Firstly, they opposed the exemption in the Bill for activities undertaken &quot;in accordance with an approved code of conduct&quot;. Secondly, they argued that, if an activity was inherently cruel, it should be deemed as such by Parliament, rather than prosecutors having to argue and prove cruelty in every court case.

Following a series of evidence hearings in 2002, on 3 December 2002, DEFRA Minister of State for Rural Affairs Alun Michael introduced a bill which would have allowed some licensed hunting. In July 2003, by a majority of 208 in a free vote, the Commons passed an amendment proposed by Tony Banks to ban hunting entirely, but in October 2003 this was rejected by the House of Lords by a majority of 212.

==Voting, conflict with the Lords and royal assent==
A bill identical to the one passed by the House of Commons in 2003 was reintroduced to the Commons on 9 September 2004.

On 15 September 2004, the day of the final vote (third reading) on the bill, two protesters staged the first invasion of the House of Commons chamber since King Charles I in 1641. The protesters were quickly removed by Parliamentary officials, but the incident led to a review of parliamentary security, given that it was the second breach of the security of the chamber in four months (Fathers 4 Justice activists had thrown purple flour in the Commons four months earlier). Simultaneously, a demonstration of between 8,000 and 10,000 people, including protesters from the Countryside Alliance filled Parliament Square outside. Later, John Holliday wrote for the &quot;Guardian&quot; an essay on his actions.

On 17 November, on one of the days of the Parliamentary session, the Lords again insisted on its amendments to the main Bill. In the Commons, the Government&#x27;s last-ditch attempt to compromise on a delay until 31 July 2007 won the support of only 46 MPs, although the delay until 2006 was inserted in the Bill. The Lords, who would have had to have accepted the Commons&#x27; other amendments (including the principle of a ban on hunting) and dues, rejected the proposal by 153 to 114.

With the Lords and Commons unable to come to agreement by the end of the Parliamentary year the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached. The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions. The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation; however, other newspapers and broadcasters condemned Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour administration for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.

The act came into force on 18 February 2005, three calendar months after it received royal assent.

==Exempt hunting==
The Act exempts some limited forms of hunting believed to be necessary. Hunting with dogs is exempt from the Act if it falls within a class listed in Schedule 1, which may be amended by an Order made by the Secretary of State for the Environment.

Schedule 1 of the Act specifies nine forms of hunting with dogs which are exempt, subject to conditions in each case:
#Stalking and flushing out
#Use of dogs below ground to protect birds for shooting
#Rats
#Rabbits
#Retrieval of hares
#Falconry
#Recapture of wild mammal
#Rescue of wild mammal
#Research and observation

The Countryside Alliance has noted that &quot;The Act makes it an offence to hunt a mouse with a dog but not a rat, you can legally hunt a rabbit but not a hare. You can flush a fox to guns with two dogs legally but if you use three it&#x27;s an offence. You can flush a fox to a bird of prey with as many dogs as you like.&quot;

===Stalking and flushing out===

Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by packs of dogs to be shot.

Stalking and flushing out are exempt under the Act, subject to five conditions:

Firstly, the stalking or flushing out is for the purpose of preventing or reducing serious damage which the wild mammal would otherwise cause to livestock, to game birds or wild birds, to food for livestock, to crops, to growing timber, to fisheries, to other property, or to biological diversity; or for obtaining meat for human or animal consumption; or for participation in a field trial competition in which dogs flush animals out of cover and/or retrieve animals that have been shot.

Secondly, the stalking or flushing out must take place on land which belongs to the person doing the stalking or flushing out or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose.

Thirdly, only one or two dogs may be used.

Fourthly, the use of a dog below ground is limited as in the next section.

Fifthly, reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that as soon as possible after being found or flushed out, the wild mammal is shot dead by a competent person, and that each dog used is kept under sufficiently close control to ensure that it does not obstruct the prevention or reduction of serious damage.

Flushing to guns is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, decided that this activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least because it is more difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place.

This exemption was claimed by one stag hound pack in the Exmoor area. In an appeal judgment following the conviction of two stag hunt officials, the judge said that such hunting conducted primarily for recreation was unlawful.

=== Use of dogs below ground to protect birds for shooting===
Hunting below ground often took place with terriers, and the Act outlaws hunting with terriers, apart from a narrowly drawn exemption, described by the Minister, Alun Michael MP, as existing &quot;for gamekeepers&quot;.

The use of one such dog is exempt, but only in the course of stalking or flushing out, and in accordance with four conditions.

The activity must be carried out &quot;for the purpose of preventing or reducing serious damage to gamebirds or wild birds which a person is keeping or preserving for the purpose of their being shot.&quot;

The stalker or person doing the flushing out must have written evidence that the land concerned belongs to him, or that he has been given permission to use it for the purpose, and must make the evidence immediately available for inspection by a constable who asks to see it.

Only one dog can be used below ground at any time.

Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that 
*as soon as possible after being found the wild mammal is flushed out from below ground and is shot dead by a competent person
*the dog is under close control
*injury to the dog is prevented; and 
*the use of the dog complies with any code of practice issued or approved by the Secretary of State.

Despite this, many fox hunts continue to use terriers regularly. Three people, not associated with hunts, have pleaded guilty to offences under the Hunting Act 2004 for hunting with terriers and a fourth was found guilty after a trial.

===Hunting rats and rabbits===
In enacting the Hunting Act, parliament accepted the view that the hunting of rats and rabbits is legitimate, as they are pests. Parliament did not believe there was any necessity to use dogs to hunt mice, so provided no such exemption.

The hunting of rats and rabbits is exempt only if it takes place on land which belongs to the hunter, or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose by the occupier or (if unoccupied) by an owner.

===Retrieval of hares===
The hunting of a hare which has been shot is exempt if it takes place on land which belongs to the hunter, or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose.

In a private prosecution under the Act brought by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) who had observed two hare coursing events in villages near Malton, North Yorkshire in March 2007 organised by the Yorkshire Greyhound Field Trialling Club, the District Judge in Scarborough magistrates court clarified that the club was mistaken in believing that because the dogs they had been using were muzzled, the practice was lawful.

===Falconry===
In making falconry an exempt form of hunting, the Act lays down two conditions.

&quot;Flushing a wild mammal from cover is exempt hunting if undertaken for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal.&quot;

Such activity must be done on land which belongs to the hunter or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose.

Many traditional hunts have bought birds of prey and say that they are using hounds to flush foxes to the bird of prey. Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds. If this view proves to be correct, then it is unlikely that such a use of dogs is lawful.

Expert opinion on the limitations of flushing foxes to birds of prey will be available to advise courts considering such cases, when they are litigated. For now, the question of what is lawful remains to be determined.

===Recapture of wild mammal===
This exemption is for the hunting of a wild mammal which has escaped or been released from captivity, subject to these conditions:

The activity must take place on land which belongs to the hunter, or on land which he has been given permission to use for the purpose, or with the authority of a constable.

Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that as soon as possible after being found the wild mammal is recaptured or shot dead by a competent person, and that each dog used in the hunt is kept under close control.

The wild mammal must not have been released or allowed to escape for the purpose of being hunted.

===Rescue of wild mammal===
The hunting of an injured wild mammal is exempt, subject to these conditions:

The hunter must reasonably believe that the wild mammal is or may be injured.

The hunting must be for the purpose of relieving the wild mammal&#x27;s suffering.

No more than two dogs may be used.

There must be no use of a dog below ground.

The activity must take place on land which belongs to the hunter or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose or with the authority of a constable.

Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that as soon as possible after the wild mammal is found appropriate action (if any) is taken to relieve its suffering, and that each dog used in the hunt is kept under close control.

The wild mammal must not have been harmed to enable it to be hunted under this exemption.

===Research and observation===
The last form of exempt hunting which is provided for in the Act is subject to these conditions:

The hunting must be undertaken &quot;for the purpose of or in connection with the observation or study of the wild mammal.&quot;

No more than two dogs may be used, and no dog below ground.

The activity must take place on land which belongs to the hunter, or which he has been given permission to use for the purpose.

Each dog used must be kept under close control to ensure that it does not injure the wild mammal.

==Failed challenges==
Challenges to the Act which questioning the legality of the Parliament Act 1949 in the High Court and Court of Appeal failed (for example &quot;Jackson v Attorney General&quot;). The House of Lords in their judicial capacity agreed with the lower courts in a judgment delivered in October 2005.

An application for judicial review was made to the High Court of England and Wales which argued that the anti-hunting legislation contravenes individual human or property rights protected in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and under European Community law and on grounds of the free movement of goods and services. The application was dismissed by the High Court in July 2005, the Court of Appeal in June 2006 and the House of Lords in November 2007. An application to the European Court of Human Rights was ruled inadmissible.

==Penalties and enforcement==
A person guilty of an offence under this Act is liable on summary conviction to an unlimited fine at the discretion of judges. (The provisions of the law state a penalty not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, however, level 5 currently has no upper limit).

Analysis published in 2015 by pro-hunting pressure group the Countryside Alliance of 2005-14 data from the Ministry of Justice shows that 378 people have been convicted of Hunting Act offences over that period, but only 24 of the offenders were involved with registered hunts. They therefore conclude that more than 94% of Hunting Act convicted offenders were not members of registered hunts but were involved in poaching or other casual hunting activities. Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said in a written answer to Parliament in June 2011 that &quot;it is not possible to separately identify those specific cases proceeded against under the Hunting Act 2004 related to hunts recognised and regulated by the Council of Hunting Associations&quot; since &quot;statistical information available centrally does not include the circumstances of each case.&quot; In 2014, the number of successful convictions under the act had risen to 430.

Animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA, IFAW and the League Against Cruel Sports monitor some hunts, which they believe may be breaking the law. Small, local groups of Hunt Monitors, made up of independent, private individuals, also engage in regular hunt monitoring. In 2011 the League Against Cruel Sports complained that &quot;On several occasions over the last few years, we have provided what we believed to be good evidence to Devon &amp; Cornwall Police, but the police haven&#x27;t even moved from the starting blocks by interviewing suspects. Some cases have run out of time and sometimes the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decide to take no action.&quot;

Police forces have said, on a number of occasions, that enforcement of the Hunting Act 2004 like much wildlife crime is a low priority for them, although they say that they will enforce the law. However, the Police&#x27;s UK National Wildlife Crime Unit has said that policing of hunting should be a priority for forces in some areas of the country, most notably the South West.

== Key court cases involving registered hunts==

===Tony Wright (Exmoor Foxhounds): 2006–2009===
Tony Wright, huntsman for the Exmoor Foxhounds, was convicted of illegal hunting with dogs in Barnstaple magistrates court in August 2006 in a private prosecution by the League Against Cruel Sports, but was then acquitted by the High Court on appeal. The appeal took place at the request of the Crown Prosecution Service who wished to determine if it is necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate that any hunting taking place was not exempt, or for the defence to prove that it was exempt; also to define what was meant by &quot;hunting&quot;. The High Court ruled that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the conditions of the exemption had not been met. It also ruled that for the offence of &quot;hunting a wild mammal&quot; to take place there must be an identifiable mammal.

=== Julian Barnfield (Heythrop Hunt): 2009 ===
Charges of illegal hunting of a fox between November 2008 and February 2009 brought against Julian Barnfield of the Heythrop Hunt by the Crown Prosecution Service were dropped in March 2009 in response to the earlier High Court ruling in the Tony Wright case that &#x27;searching&#x27; for a mammal was not hunting and that &quot;hunting could only be an &#x27;intentional&#x27; activity&quot;.

=== Derek Hopkins and Kevin Allen (Fernie Hunt): 2011 ===
Huntsman Derek Hopkins and terrierman Kevin Allen, employees of the Fernie Hunt from Great Bowden, were convicted of illegal hunting in October 2011. They also lost their appeal, partly based on video evidence collected by the League Against Cruel Sports. It was the third successful prosecution for illegal fox hunting using the 2004 Act.

=== Crawley and Horsham Hunt: 2008–2013 ===

In 2008, the Crawley and Horsham Hunt launched a legal action in the High Court for trespass, nuisance, and harassment against Simon and Jane Wild of West Sussex Wildlife Protection and West Sussex Badger Protection Group. The hunt used Timothy Lawson-Cruttenden, an expert in the use of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in such cases. This was viewed as a test case and received support from the Countryside Alliance, the Master of Foxhounds Association and 80 landowners and if successful was planned to lead to a request for an injunction against everyone associated with these groups from interfering with the hunt. The defendants claimed to have evidence of illegal hunting taking place and were asking the court to accept this as a defence to the Harassment Act action. The original judge, Justice Cranston, stepped down in July 2008 due to earlier comments made in support of the ban made while an MP. During the second trial it was reported that the judge dismissed nuisance and trespass, because they had &quot;fundamental defects&quot;, leaving only harassment. It was also reported that the protestors, using an undercover infiltrator, had been able to get hold of conclusive evidence that the claimants were engaged in illegal fox hunting. The principal plaintiff, Simon Greenwood, was filmed using his hounds to chase a fox to ground and then call in terrier-men to dig it out and throw it to the hounds. The plaintiffs dropped the case in July 2009, and agreed to pay costs estimated at over £120,000.

Officials of the Crawley and Horsham Hunt were found guilty in May 2012 of Hunting Act offences: professional huntsman Andrew Phillis, joint master Neill Millard and the hunt secretary Rachel Holdsworth were convicted on a total of five charges of illegally hunting. Millard and Holdsworth were fined £1000 each and both ordered to pay £2500 costs. Phillis was later sentenced to a £500 fine and £2500 costs.

In September 2013, professional huntsman Nicholas Bycroft pleaded guilty to an offence under Section 1 of the Hunting Act: he admitted illegally hunting a fox during a meet at Angmering Park, near Arundel, West Sussex, on 19 February 2013. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge, £150 costs and £15 victim surcharge.

=== RSPCA vs Heythrop Hunt: 2012 ===
In December 2012 the RSPCA took out a private prosecution against Heythrop Hunt Limited. This was a landmark case, as it was the first time that an organized hunt was prosecuted as a corporate body. The Heythrop Hunt, its Huntsman, Julian Barnfield, and its Senior Master, Richard Sumner, all pleaded guilty to four charges of illegally hunting a fox at Oxford magistrates court in December 2012. Barnfield, a former huntsman with the Heythrop and one of those convicted, said that the case had been politically motivated with its links with David Cameron&#x27;s constituency. The presiding magistrate called the RSPCA&#x27;s £327,000 costs &quot;staggering&quot;; however, Gavin Grant, the chief executive of the RSPCA, said that the organisation would prevent cruelty to animals by all lawful means and had prosecuted 1,341 individuals and secured 3,114 convictions in the past year with a success rate of more than 98%.

===Other cases===
Subsequently, three pending prosecutions against hunts, including one brought privately by the League Against Cruel Sports, were dropped and a further two cases which did reach court were thrown out at the conclusion of the prosecution cases when the District Judges ruled that there was no case to answer.

From March to November 2013, staff of six separate hunts were either acquitted of Hunting Act offences or had the prosecutions against them dropped, including three foxhound packs (The York &amp; Ainsty South, the Avon Vale and the Ledbury), a harrier pack (Weston &amp; Banwell Harriers), a staghound pack (The Quantock Staghounds) and a beagle pack (The RAC Beagles).

In September 2013 David Parker, the huntsman of the Seavington Hunt, was fined after he admitted illegally hunting a fox with dogs in Dorset. The prosecution was brought by the RSPCA with evidence from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).

==Perspectives==

===Public opinion===
Public opinion has tended to be in favour of the ban on fox hunting:
* A survey commissioned by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2002 indicated that a majority of people (57%) agreed with the statement that &#x27;hunting with dogs is never acceptable&#x27;.
*A survey by MORI for the BBC carried out in February 2005 found that there was a plurality of support for the new legislation, but not an absolute majority (47% supporting, 26% opposed).
*In 2009, Ipsos MORI found that a total of 75% supported the ban on fox hunting.
* In 2010, the figure was almost identical, with 76% being opposed to repealing the Hunting Act, including with 71% of rural residents. There was 18% support for repeal.
*A poll by MORI in December 2012 showed no change on fox hunting, with 76% being opposed to moves to make it legal, rising to 81% in respect to deer hunting.
*Ahead of Boxing Day 2016 a poll was released which indicated opposition to fox hunting had reached all-time highs, with 84% of voters, including 82% of those in rural areas, opposing fox hunting.
*An opinion poll in May 2017 revealed overwhelming public opposition to hunting with dogs, including the repeal of the Hunting Act 2004. 64% of voters disagreed with the statement that &quot;the ban on fox hunting should be reversed&quot;, including 46% who &quot;strongly disagreed&quot;. Just 11% supported the repeal of the ban. The poll was published in the aftermath of the release of the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election, which promised a vote on the repeal of the Act. Only 16% of Conservative voters want the ban overturned, with 50% opposed.

== Proposed Coalition review ==
The Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement, agreed by the new government following the 2010 general election, aimed to give MPs a free vote &quot;to express its view&quot; on repealing the Hunting Act 2004 when parliamentary time allowed; in late 2010, it was thought this might be in &quot;early 2012&quot;. The prime minister, David Cameron, explained in January 2012 &quot;I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I think there should be a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this. My problem has always been that it was just taking the criminal law into an area of activity where it didn&#x27;t really belong.&quot; However, in December 2012 Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said that there was no immediate likelihood of winning a Commons vote to make hunting legal again and that supporters of hunting would need to do &quot;more work&quot; to win over sceptical MPs.

==Proposed Conservative amendments==
The 2015 Conservative Government proposed &quot;technical&quot; amendments to the Act. These were officially postponed on 14 July 2015.

At the 2017 election Theresa May pledged to hold a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act if the Conservative Party won a majority. These plans were scrapped in January 2018.

At the 2019 election the Conservative Party announced that they would not make any changes to the Hunting Act leading to suggestions that the Conservatives would no longer oppose the Hunting Ban.

<text>The Voix celeste () is an organ stop consisting of either one or two ranks of pipes slightly out of tune. The term &quot;celeste&quot; refers to a rank of pipes detuned slightly so as to produce a beating effect when combined with a normally tuned rank. It is also used to refer to a compound stop of two or more ranks in which all the ranks are detuned relative to each other.

The Voix celeste is located in the swell box on British and American organs and in the &quot;Récit expressif&quot; on French organs. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a stop of similar tonal quality of its own, normally a Viola da gamba or Salicional. When both stops are played together an undulant, warm sounding string effect is generated. When proper organ terminology is used, &quot;Voix Celeste&quot; will always use string-voiced pipes. Frequently, both ranks of pipes required are placed on the same stop knob, and it is labeled as &quot;Voix Celeste II&quot;. The celeste concept is extended to other types of organ voices (notably flutes) but they will be called by the name of the primary sound (e.g. &quot;Spitzflöte Celeste&quot;).

A similar stop is the &quot;Unda maris&quot;, which is similar to the Voix celeste except that it typically uses a Dulciana or a softer-scale string (or even flutes), as opposed to the Voix Celeste which almost always refers to a brighter-scaled string celeste. The &quot;Voce Umana&quot; is an Italian variant of the celeste employing Principal pipes.

<text>Juan Nepomuceno Seguín (October 27, 1806 – August 27, 1890) was a Spanish-Tejano political and military figure of the Texas Revolution who helped to establish the independence of Texas. Numerous places and institutions are named in his honor, including the county seat of Seguin in Guadalupe County, the Juan N. Seguin Memorial Interchange in Houston, Juan Seguin Monument in Seguin, World War II Liberty Ship SS &quot;Juan N. Seguin&quot;, Seguin High School in Arlington.

==Early life==
Juan Nepomuceno Seguin was born on October 27, 1806, in San Antonio de Bexar, Province of Texas, Viceroyalty of New Spain, to Juan José María Erasmo Seguin, a second-generation Bexareño, and Maria Josefa Becerra. As the son of a postal administrator, he would help his mother in business, while his father was one of the drafting rapporteurs for the Mexican Constitution of 1824. In 1825, Seguin married María Gertrudis Flores de Abrego. They had ten children. He was elected an alderman in December, 1828 and served on numerous electoral boards before becoming the San Antonio alcalde (mayor) in December 1833. He then served as political chief of Bexar in 1834, when the previous chief became ill. In 1835, he led a relief force to Monclova, when the Federalist Governor appealed for help.

==Texas Revolution==

As a teenager in Mexico, he had a strong interest in politics. While Antonio López de Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution of 1824, Seguín was very critical of his contemporary Mexican leader. Years later Seguín gladly joined the Texas Revolution to rid the area of Santa Anna&#x27;s rule. In 1835–1836, Seguín recruited and commanded troops for the Texian Army. He was commissioned a captain by Stephen F. Austin in October 1835 and was tasked with supplying the Texian troops with food and provisions. Seguín sent out scouting parties to the Missions of San Antonio in search of a suitable base camp for the Texians and participated in the early successful Battle of Concepcion.

Martín Perfecto de Cos was appointed as military governor over Texas by his brother-in-law Antonio López de Santa Anna, and established his headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, 1835. Upwards of 160 &quot;rancheros&quot; (Mexican ranch owners) and other Tejanos under Seguín, José Carbajal, Plácido Benavides, Salvador Flores and Manuel Leal joined Austin and approximately 400 Texians at the Siege of Béxar. After a two-month battle, Cos surrendered on December 9.

In January 1836, Seguín was commissioned as a captain in the regular Texas army. Upon the return of Santa Anna&#x27;s army, Seguín joined William B. Travis on February 23, in the Battle of the Alamo. Although serving at the Alamo during the thirteen-day siege, he did not actually participate in the final battle of the Alamo. He was chosen to carry the Alamo message through enemy lines, that the Texans &quot;shall never surrender or retreat&quot;. Seguín got that message through to the other soldiers on the Texian side. He then returned with men to reinforce the Alamo, but it had already fallen to Santa Anna&#x27;s army.

After the Alamo, he re-formed cavalry companies at Gonzales and acted as the rear guard, providing protection for fleeing Texas families during the Runaway Scrape. His company, with Captain Moseley Baker&#x27;s company, blocked the Mexican army from crossing the Brazos River, preventing them from overtaking the Texians. His cavalry command, participating as infantry with Sherman&#x27;s company, fought in the victorious Battle of San Jacinto. In May 1836, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On June 4, as a representative of the Republic of Texas, he accepted the formal surrender of the Mexican forces in the Alamo.

==Life under the Republic of Texas==
After Texas became a Republic, he was the head of the San Antonio military, commanding a force to defend the western frontier. Texas army Brigadier General Felix Huston ordered Seguín in early 1837 to arrange for burial of the Alamo defenders&#x27; remains that had been left where they were burned. Ashes were identified and collected at three unrecorded sites. Prior to the February 25 funeral, the casket lay in &quot;the parish church&quot;. An account provided by Seguin, in the March 28, 1837 issue of the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot;, states they were buried where the majority of ashes had been found, but was not specific about the location. He told historian Reuben Potter in 1861 that the site was in a peach orchard near the mission. Twenty-eight years later in correspondence with Hamilton P. Bee, Seguín remembered placing the remains in a tomb inside the &quot;Cathedral of San Antonio&quot;. Remains believed to be those of the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando in 1936, the battle&#x27;s centennial. Time had decayed their original container, and they were re-interred in a marble sarcophagus. Purported to hold the ashes of Travis, Bowie and Crockett, some have doubted it can be proven whose remains are actually entombed there.

Seguín was elected as a Texas Senator from 1837 to 1840 and worked closely with Congressman José Antonio Navarro to ensure legislation that would be in the best interest of the citizenry of Texas, who were quickly becoming the political minority. In 1839, Seguín, captain of a Texas force of about fifty-four men, again protected the colonists in the Henry Karnes campaign against the hostile Comanche Indians. In 1839, at a town thirty miles east of San Antonio, he was honored by parade and celebration; that newly named town would now bear his own name, Seguin. In 1840, he resigned his congressional seat in order to join a controversial campaign against the Centralist government in Mexico City. He became mayor of San Antonio in 1841.

Texas became flooded with adventurous and land-hungry North Americans who were unfamiliar with the native Texans&#x27; history and their loyal support of Texas. Seguin&#x27;s leadership and loyalty was challenged by these newcomers. Refusing to burn San Antonio to the ground by order of the new head of the Texas military was just the beginning.

In 1842, San Antonio was overrun by Santa Anna&#x27;s forces. During March 1842, Colonel Seguin and the citizens of San Antonio sought refuge at Manuel Flores&#x27; Ranch in the city of Seguin, Texas. A counterattack was planned, and even though Seguín pursued the army of Ráfael Vásquez, chasing them from Texas, he was deemed to be to blame for the attack.

Seguín resigned from office in April, due to threats on his life. Opposition to his defense of Texas rights, adversities, and false charges that he was aiding the Mexican army proved too much to bear. He fled to Mexico to &quot;seek refuge amongst my enemies&quot;, where he was captured, arrested and coerced to enlist in the Mexican army as a staff officer. He returned to San Antonio with the opposition army of Adrian Woll in September 1842 and later served under Santa Anna in the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.

==Later life==
In February 1848, Seguín requested permission to return to Texas. By the year&#x27;s end, he had returned, building a home in 1852; adjacent to his father Erasmo Seguín&#x27;s house, and ranching in Floresville, Texas. He was elected to two terms as Justice of the Peace of Bexar County in 1852 and 1854, and became a founding father of the Democratic Party in Bexar county. In 1858, he published his life memoirs. Seguín served as County Judge in Wilson County in 1869. However, business dealings occasionally took him back to Mexico, and in around 1883 he settled in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to be near his son Santiago, who was mayor. He died there on August 27, 1890. His remains were returned to Texas in 1974 and as part of the nation&#x27;s Bicentennial celebration were reinterred in his namesake town, Seguin, during ceremonies on July 4, 1976. A large monument, depicting him on horseback waving his saber, now honors his service to Texas, in the downtown Seguin Central Park.

<doc id="1184993" wikidata="Q5973777" url="?curid=1184993" title="ISCABBS">
<text>ISCABBS, also known as ISCA, is a computer bulletin board system (&quot;BBS&quot;), formerly based at the University of Iowa. &quot;Daves&#x27; own version of Citadel&quot; (DOC), an early branch of the Citadel/UX BBS software, was developed to run ISCA. Like most Citadels, the focus is almost entirely on conversation among users.

==History==
Governed by, and named for the Iowa Student Computer Association (ISCA), ISCABBS was started in 1989. Previously a computer conferencing software program entitled &quot;Participate&quot; made by Unison (Iowa students referred to it as &quot;Parti&quot;) resided on the University of Iowa&#x27;s Prime mainframe computer (running the Primos operating system) and was accessible to all University students.

===Precursors===
Many of the Parti users had migrated over from a student created BBS called BBS1 (circa 1985) which was accessed from its creator&#x27;s personal account &quot;astran&quot; on the University of Iowa mainframe computer PrimeA. BBS1 was created and administered by Randy Frank (Mr Nybble) and David Richards (The Oracle) after they realized the popularity of their games and the hidden messaging system that was available from within the games. The original message system was concealed inside their &quot;Draw Poker&quot; game and allowed the creators the ability to convey progress and leave notes regarding current projects. The board was promoted across campus on flyers placed in computer labs. Users took on handles and developed a culture of their own with socialization being the main use of the board. A BBS1 user group was started and held infrequent meetings and offered T-shirts with a mystical picture and the caption &quot;BBS1: A meeting of the minds&quot;. The software eventually was altered and passed around by a rogue sysop in a version known as &quot;STEALTH&quot; which could be compiled and executed on a user&#x27;s own personal account. The main message system files were no longer safe or private once the general user population learned the directory names. The anonymity of a handle was proven to be non-existent and the cracked software allowed anybody to read any file they chose and track users back to their originating personal accounts.

===DOC creation===
Several student programmers began to create an improved code using the Citadel framework. As several developers were named &quot;Dave&quot; - including two key developers of the early software - it was coined &quot;Dave&#x27;s own version of &quot; or &quot;DOC&quot; (Note: Often, this has been written &quot;Daves&#x27; own version...&quot; to note the plurality of Daves involved in the project). The Daves include the project leader &quot;Doctor Dave&quot; Lacey, who is now an M.D., and Dave &quot;Screaming Fist&quot; Nelson. Originally ISCABBS was run on the University of Iowa&#x27;s Engineering Departments Iowa Computer Aided Engineering Network &quot;ICAEN&quot; and accessible only by engineering students. However, ISCABBS was soon made available to all University of Iowa students and then to anyone with an internet connection. In addition to the BBS, a file sharing system was made available for freeware and shareware, and at one point was one of the most popular repositories in the Simtel file distribution network.

===Peak of popularity===
At its peak just before the rise of the World Wide Web, it supported more than a thousand users online simultaneously and a virtual velvet-roped queue in which hundreds more waited to log in when the system was very busy. The popularity of ISCA as a meeting place, hangout, and occasionally a virtual dive bar gives a glimpse of what modern day chat rooms would become. Between serious discussion on topics ranging from social issues and politics to computer and home repair, lighthearted babble about almost any topic can be found. In addition, instant messaging (called eXpress Messages - or simply Xes - in the lingo of DOC BBSes and other citadel-derived systems) provides a venue for private discussion and conversation.

Before the rise of the Web, ISCABBS was one of the largest free public bulletin board systems in the world. It continues on today as a likely candidate for the most active telnet-based BBS in the world.

===Moving to new software===
At one point the BBS was poised to cut over to a new platform called Gestalt. It was a project developed almost entirely by Lee Brintle (also known as &quot;Tanj&quot;), an ISCA member and former BBS Sysop. ISCA (the Iowa Student Computer Association) was offered free license to use this new BBS platform which offered not only integration with the old BBS platform but also enabled developers to construct instant messaging, email, and web-based interfaces to the BBS, much like many modern messageboards have today. The cutover was scheduled for &quot;sometime in 1998&quot; and would have enabled the BBS to very easily run on commodity hardware (Intel PCs) rather than expensive, proprietary, and increasingly hard-to-obtain HP workstations. Conflicts over licensing terms, ownership, and other interpersonal issues caused the cutover to Gestalt to never happen.&lt;br&gt;
As of September 23, 2014, ISCA was permanently migrated over to a Linux-based virtual when the original system exhibited some issues. Most of the functionality remains identical with a few changes, such as adding eXpress message retention, and removing delays during registration and idle account deletions.

===Moving away from the University of Iowa===
The ISCA student group created a non-profit corporation (Iowa Student Computing Alumni) and separated from the University of Iowa on December 16, 2006.

The domain name has been changed to bbs.iscabbs.com from bbs.isca.uiowa.edu.

==Infrastructure==
ISCABBS originally supported over a thousand simultaneous users on a 50 MHz PA-RISC system with 64MB of RAM, which ran HP-UX. In later years, the system was upgraded to an 80 MHz processor and 128MB of RAM, though the active user base is much smaller. Connectivity was provided by the University of Iowa. Due to the popularity of the BBS and its limited resources, much effort went into shrinking the size of the BBS process in memory. Stripped-down versions of standard libraries were written that included only the handful of functions that the BBS required to operate.

When ISCA separated from the University of Iowa to become its own non-profit organization, the BBS was moved to a new co-location hosting facility in Iowa City, Iowa. ISCABBS ran on an HP Visualize model B132L workstation, with a 132 MHz processor, 192 MB of RAM, and two 2 GB SCSI disks. However, as noted above, it has now migrated to a Linux virtual hosted by user Chris Gauthier (Copper Lethe).

==Features==

===Topical discussion areas===
ISCABBS has the capability of having 200 forums (formerly known as rooms) for discussion of assigned topics. Forum Moderators are assigned to each forum are responsible to ensure compliance with the topicality of the forum as well as ISCABBS boardwide Policy.

===Instant messaging===
eXpress messaging is another functionality which allows users to send up to five lines of an instant or &quot;express&quot; message to another user. These messages are not permanently stored; only messages received and sent during the current user session can be reviewed.

===Internal mailing===
A special mail forum allows for private messages of unlimited length to be sent to and from users. These messages are stored for a significant period of time (typically three to nine months).

===Client interface===
Multiple clients have been created to ease interface with ISCABBS, provide additional features as well as distribute a portion of ISCABBS&#x27;s overhead from the ISCABBS machine to the client machine. Client programs gained popularity amongst BBS users during the mid-1990s, when client users were able to shorten their wait in queue before login. Clients remain in common use for their various graphical, navigational, and communication functions, as well as one-click ease of connectivity. Clients can be found at BBSClient.net .

==Events==

===ISCANic===
ISCABBS has semi-annual picnic or &quot;ISCANIC&quot; events held in Iowa City, Iowa, typically with parties and/or gatherings following. Recently annual camping or &quot;CampNic&quot; events have been added. Various regional &quot;NICs&quot; have been held on a more irregular schedule. These events have been held for nearly fifteen years, though none have occurred in recent memory.

===CampNic===
Recently an annual &quot;CampNic&quot; is held at Whitebreast Campground at Lake Red Rock near Knoxville, IA for more &quot;outdoorsey&quot; meetings of the members of ISCABBS.

==ISCA Not for Profit Corporation==
On December 16, 2007, control of the BBS transferred to the Iowa Student Computing Alumni, an Iowa not for profit corporation. This ended the association between ISCABBS and the University of Iowa.

===Initial membership requirements===
Membership of the new ISCA is open to all BBS users subject to approval by a 2/3 majority of existing members and payment of annual dues. Meetings are held on-line rather than in Iowa City.

===Policy Board===
The Iowa Student Computing Alumni have elected a seven-member policy board to govern day-to-day operations of the BBS. Four seats are opened for election in the spring, and three in the autumn for one-year terms.

<text>James F. &quot;Jumbo&quot; Elliott (August 8, 1915 – March 22, 1981) was an American track and field coach, often considered to be one of the greatest of all time. His achievements include producing five Olympic gold medal winners between 1956 and 1968.

Elliott, a college track runner of short and middle distances, graduated from Villanova University in 1935 and returned to coach the track team in 1949 until his death in 1981. In that period, his teams won eight national collegiate team titles, while his athletes won 82 NCAA crowns and set 66 world records. He produced a total of 28 Olympic competitors, five of whom won gold medals: Ron Delany (1956, 1500 m), Charles Jenkins (1956, 400 m), Don Bragg (1960, pole vault), Paul Drayton (1964, 4 × 100 m relay), and Larry James (1968, 4 × 400 m relay). He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1981. Elliot had a stammer. He died in 1981, and is buried in the Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken, PA.

<text>Akhmim (, ; Akhmimic , ; Sahidic/Bohairic ) is a city in the Sohag Governorate of Upper Egypt. Referred to by the ancient Greeks as Khemmis or Chemmis () and Panopolis (), it is located on the east bank of the Nile, to the northeast of Sohag.

== History ==

Akhmim was known in Ancient Egypt as Ipu, Apu (according to Brugsch the name is related to the nearby village of Kafr Abou) or Khent-min. It was the capital of the ninth (Chemmite) nome of Upper Egypt.

The city is a suggested hometown for Yuya, the official of Tuthmosis IV and Amenhotep III.

The ithyphallic Min (whom the Greeks identified with Pan) was worshipped here as &quot;the strong Horus.&quot; Herodotus mentions the temple dedicated to Perseus and asserts that Chemmis was remarkable for being the hero’s birthplace, wherein celebrations and games were held in his honour after the manner of the Greeks; at which prizes were given. As a matter of fact, some representations are known of Nubians and people of Punt (southern coastal Sudan and the Eritrean coast) climbing up poles before the god Min.

Min was especially a god of the desert routes on the east of Egypt, and the trading tribes are likely to have gathered to his festivals for business and pleasure at Coptos (which was really near Neapolis) even more than at Akhmim. Herodotus perhaps confused Coptos with Chemmis. Strabo mentions linen-weaving and stone-cutting as ancient industries of Panopolis, and it is not altogether a coincidence that the cemetery of Akhmim is one of the chief sources of the beautiful textiles of Roman and Christian age, that are brought from Egypt.

In the Christian Coptic era, Akhmim was written in Sahidic &#x27; but was probably pronounced locally something like Khmin or Khmim. Monasteries abounded in this region from a very early date.

Pachomius the Great founded a monastery known as Tkahshmin in the area. Shenouda the Archimandrite (348–466) was a monk at Athribis near Akhmim. Some years earlier Nestorius, the exiled ex-patriarch of Constantinople, had died at an old age in the neighborhood of Akhmim. Nonnus, the Greek poet, was born at Panopolis at the end of the 4th century. The bishopric of Panopolis, a suffragan of Antinoë in Thebais Prima, is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. Among the bishops of Panopolis, Le Quien mentions Arius, friend of Saint Pachomius who had built three convents in the city, Sabinus, and Menas. Excavations at Akhmim have disclosed numerous Christian manuscripts, among them fragments of the &quot;Book of Henoch&quot;, of the Gospel, and of the &quot;Apocalypse of Peter&quot;, the &quot;Acts of the Council of Ephesus&quot;, as well as numerous other Christian inscriptions.

In the 13th century AD, a very imposing temple still stood in Akhmim. Today, little of its past glory remains. Nothing is left of the town, the temples were almost completely dismantled, and their material reused in the later Middle Ages. The extensive cemeteries of ancient Akhmim are yet to be fully explored. The destroyed corner of a Greco-Roman period temple with colossal statues of Ramesses II and Meritamen was discovered in 1981.

Of Akhmim, in 1818 Jacques Collin de Plancy wrote in his book, the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, that the city &quot;formerly had the reputation of being the abode of the greatest magicians. Paul Lucas speaks, in his second voyage, of the marvelous serpent of Akhmin, which Muslims honor as an angel, and which Christians believe to be the demon Asmodeus.&quot;

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).

== Modern city ==
Akhmim is the largest town on the east side of the Nile in Sohag Governorate. In 1907, the population of the city was 23,795, of whom about one third were Copts. Akhmim has several mosques and two Coptic churches. The Monastery of the Martyrs is located about 6 km northeast of the city. Akhmim maintains a weekly market, and manufactures cotton goods, notably the blue shirts and check shawls with silk fringes worn by the poorer classes of Egypt. Outside the walls are the scanty ruins of two ancient temples. On the west bank of the Nile opposite of Akhmim, there is railway communication with Cairo and Aswan.

<text>Prorogation in the Westminster system of government is the action of proroguing, or interrupting, a parliament, or the discontinuance of meetings for a given period of time, without a dissolution of parliament. The term is also used for the period of such a discontinuance between two legislative sessions of a legislative body.

==Ancient Rome==

In the constitution of ancient Rome, &quot;prorogatio&quot; was the extension of a commander&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot; beyond the one-year term of his magistracy, usually that of consul or praetor. Prorogatio developed as a legal procedure in response to Roman expansionism and militarization.

This usage is unrelated to the modern parliamentary term.

In Australia, prorogation is the end of a session in the Australian Parliament pursuant to section 5 of the Constitution of Australia. Prorogation in Australia is more often referred to as &#x27;dissolution&#x27;. Prorogation can only be enacted following approval by the Governor-General of Australia.

The Prime Minister of Australia may request that the Governor-General prorogue parliament. Although prorogation before the end of a parliamentary term isn&#x27;t unconstitutional, it is usually rejected by the Governor-General. 

==Canada==

Prorogation is the end of a session in the Parliament of Canada.
==India==
Prorogation implies the end of the sitting as well as the session and not the dissolution of the House in the Indian Parliament. The Rajya Sabha is not dissolved as it is a permanent House, only the Lok Sabha is dissolved. The President can prorogue the House while in session also.

==New Zealand==

Prorogation is the end of a session in the New Zealand Parliament pursuant to the Constitution Act 1986. The ability of the speaker to recall parliament during an adjournment has rendered prorogation almost obsolete, and the procedure was last used in 1991.

==Northern Ireland==

Prorogation in Northern Ireland was the end of a session in the Parliament of Northern Ireland (1921–1972).

==United Kingdom==
Prorogation is the formal ending of a Parliamentary session in the UK Parliament.

== United States ==
Under Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution the President of the United States technically has the authority to adjourn the United States Congress &quot;to such Time as he shall think proper&quot; when it is unable to agree on a time of adjournment. However, this is a procedural ability that has so far never been used. The members of the Constitutional Convention agreed to limit executive authority in order to prevent autocracy. In &quot;Federalist No. 69&quot;, Alexander Hamilton differentiated the President&#x27;s authority to prorogue Congress from the King of Great Britain&#x27;s ability to dissolve Parliament.

On April 15, 2020, while Congress was in recess due to the COVID-19 pandemic but still holding &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions, President Donald Trump threatened to use the presidential prerogative powers to adjourn both the House of Representatives and the Senate in order to make recess appointments for positions such as Director of National Intelligence and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, citing what he argued was obstructionism and extreme partisanship from the Democratic Party. However, constitutional law experts and politicians have argued that President Trump did not have the constitutional authority to do so under those conditions, as both houses had agreed on a date of adjournment, and President Trump&#x27;s argument that the President can force Congress to adjourn was widely condemned by both Republicans and Democrats. In order to prorogue Congress, the Senate would have to set a different date of adjournment than the House of Representatives. Although President Trump called on the Senate to set a new adjournment date, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that he would not alter the planned adjournment date of January 3, 2021, and any motion to alter the date would require the approval of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democratic members of the Senate through the Senate Standing Rules.

<doc id="1185022" wikidata="Q2385789" url="?curid=1185022" title="Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi">
<text>Ghiyath ibn Ghawth ibn al-Salt ibn Tariqa al-Taghlibi () commonly known as al-Akhtal () (The Loquacious), was one of the most famous Arab poets of the Umayyad period. He belonged to the Banu Taghlib tribe, and was, like his fellow-tribesmen, a Christian.

==Biography==
Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibî was one of the great panegyrists of the Umayyad period. He became famous for his satires and panegyrics in a period when poetry was an important political instrument. Al-Akhtal was introduced to Yazid I by Ka&#x27;b ibn Ju&#x27;ayl and became a close friend of the heir apparent to Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (). Yazid, when he acceded to the throne, was generous to al-Akhtal. Despite his Christianity, he was favored by leading Umayyad caliphs. Throughout his life, al-Akhtal was a supporter of the ruling Umayyad dynasty. He was a friend of John of Damascus until the latter decided to give up his position at the Umayyad court and become a monk.

He lauded in his panegyrics Yazid, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and al-Walid I and in his satires attacked all the opponents of the caliphs. Al-Akhtal became the official court poet of Abd al-Malik, to whom he dedicated a number of panegyrics. But he fell into disfavour under al-Walid. The pre-Islamic Bedouin tradition is always apparent in the poems of al-Akhtal and his panegyrics show the continued vitality of this tradition. The panegyrics of al-Akhtal acquired a classical status. His poetry was accepted by critics as source of pure Arabic.

Few details are known about al-Akhtal&#x27;s personal life, save that he was married and divorced, and that he spent part of his time in Damascus, part with his tribe in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). In the Taghlib–Qays war he participated on the battlefield, as well as by his satires. In the literary strife between his contemporaries Jarir ibn Atiyah and al-Farazdaq, Akhtal was induced to support the latter poet. Al-Akhtal, Jarir and al-Farazdaq form a trio celebrated among the Arabs, but as to superiority there is dispute. Abu Ubayda placed him highest of the three on the ground that among his poems there were ten flawless &quot;qasidas&quot; (Arabic poetic odes), and ten more nearly so, and that this could not be said of the other two.

==Works==
&quot;The Poetry of al-Akhtal&quot; has been published at the Jesuit press in Beirūt, 1891. A full account of the poet and his times is given in H. Lammens’ &quot;Le chantre des Omiades&quot; (Paris, 1895) (a reprint from the &quot;Journal Asiatique&quot; for 1894).

<text>Illinois Route 58 (IL 58, Illinois 58), also known as Golf Road for most of its route, is a state highway in northeast Illinois. It runs from Illinois Route 25 (Liberty Street) in Elgin east to U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Boulevard) in Skokie. This is a distance of .

== Route description ==

It is four-lane road for most of its length, and six lanes through a very high-traffic corridor between Hoffman Estates and Schaumburg. The only section that is not multilane is from just east of Waverly Drive in Elgin to just west of Barrington Road in Hoffman Estates.

Starting in Elgin, the road is called Summit Street. Just east of Rohrssen Road in Hoffman Estates, the road is named Golf Road, which the route is commonly called locally, after the minuscule town of Golf that the route passes through.

The junction of Illinois 58 and Illinois Route 72 (Higgins Road) in Hoffman Estates form one of the only six-lane by six-lane sharply angled intersections in the state. Left turns used to be prohibited from Golf Road onto Higgins Road because of the sharp angle, but recent road construction has made a separate lane for doing this in both directions.

In Des Plaines, Illinois 58 and U.S. 14 (as the Northwest Highway here) use other minor feeder roads to provide access to each other. The feeder roads are accessible via a two-lane traffic circle north of the overpass—arguably the busiest traffic circle in the Chicago metropolitan area.

 The road continues to run east from Golf towards Skokie, turning south and running concurrent with Illinois Route 43 (Waukegan Road) before displacing U.S. Route 14 at Dempster Street as it turns back east towards U.S. 41.

== History ==
SBI Route 58 is the same as it was in 1924, with parts of it called the Evanston-Elgin Road. Before 1972, it terminated at Sheridan Road (then part of IL 42). In 1972, it was dropped east of U.S. 41. In 1981, US 20 Business in Elgin was decommissioned. As a result, IL 58 was dropped west of IL 25.

<text>Hannibal Lafayette Godwin (November 3, 1873 – June 9, 1929) was a Democratic U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1907 and 1921.

== Education and career ==
Born near Dunn in Harnett County, North Carolina, Godwin attended common schools near his home and then Trinity College (later Duke University) in Durham. He studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Godwin married Mattie Black Barnes (January 9, 1876 – January 11, 1951), daughter of Hugh and Jennetta (Parker) Barnes, on December 23, 1896, in Harnett County, North Carolina.

After being admitted to the bar in 1896, he practiced in Dunn and was elected Dunn&#x27;s mayor in 1897. In 1903, Godwin was sent to the North Carolina Senate, and from 1904 to 1906, he sat on the executive committee of the North Carolina Democratic Party.

In 1906, Godwin was first elected to the United States Congress; he would be re-elected six times, serving from March 4, 1907, to March 3, 1921. In Congress, he rose to chair the Committee on Reform in the Civil Service. He lost his congressional race in 1920 and returned to the practice of law in Dunn, where he died in 1929; he is buried in Dunn&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery.

<doc id="1185035" wikidata="Q157500" url="?curid=1185035" title="Saponaria">
<text>Saponaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to Asia and Europe, and are commonly known as soapworts. They are herbaceous perennials and annuals, some with woody bases. The flowers are abundant, five-petalled and usually in shades of pink or white. The genus is closely related to the genus &quot;Silene&quot;, being distinguished from these by having only two (not three or five) styles in the flower. It is also related to &quot;Gypsophila&quot;, but its calyx is cylindrical rather than bell-shaped.

The most familiar species might be common soapwort (&quot;S. officinalis&quot;), which is native to Eurasia but is known in much of the world as an introduced species, often a weed, and sometimes a cultivated ornamental plant. The genus name &quot;Saponaria&quot; derives from the Latin (&quot;soap&quot;) and -&quot;aria&quot; (&quot;pertaining to&quot;), and at least one species, &quot;S. officinalis&quot;, has been used to make soap. It contains saponins, and a liquid soap can be produced by soaking the leaves in water. This soap is still used to clean delicate antique tapestries. It is also sometimes stated that it is used as an emulsifier in Turkish delight confections, but this is a case of double confusion. The roots of plants in genus &quot;Gypsophila&quot; are used to make the Turkish confection helva and &quot;Saponaria&quot; species are not used.

&quot;Saponaria&quot; species are eaten by the larvae of some butterflies and moths, including the Lychnis and &quot;Coleophora saponariella&quot;, which is exclusive to the genus.

==Diversity==
There are thirty to forty species in the genus.

<doc id="1185040" wikidata="Q309104" url="?curid=1185040" title="Tibesti Mountains">
<text>The Tibesti Mountains are a mountain range in the central Sahara, primarily located in the extreme north of Chad, with a small portion located in southern Libya. The highest peak in the range, Emi Koussi, lies to the south at a height of and is the highest point in both Chad and the Sahara. Bikku Bitti, the highest peak in Libya, is located in the north of the range. The central third of the Tibesti is of volcanic origin and consists of five volcanoes topped by large depressions: Emi Koussi, Tarso Toon, Tarso Voon, Tarso Yega and Toussidé. Major lava flows have formed vast plateaus that overlie Paleozoic sandstone. The volcanic activity was the result of a continental hotspot that arose during the Oligocene and continued in some places until the Holocene, creating fumaroles, hot springs, mud pools and deposits of natron and sulfur. Erosion has shaped volcanic spires and carved an extensive network of canyons through which run rivers subject to highly irregular flows that are rapidly lost to the desert sands.

Tibesti, which means &quot;place where the mountain people live&quot;, is the domain of the Toubou people. The Toubou live mainly along the wadis, on rare oases where palm trees and limited grains grow. They harness the water that collects in gueltas, the supply of which is highly variable from year-to-year and decade-to-decade. The plateaus are used to graze livestock in the winter and harvest grain in the summer. Temperatures are high, although the altitude ensures that the range is cooler than the surrounding desert. The Toubou, who were settled in the range by the 5th century BC, adapted to these conditions and turned the range into a large natural fortress. They arrived in several waves, taking refuge in times of conflict and dispersing in times of prosperity, although not without intense internal hostility at times.

The Toubou came into contact with the Carthaginians, Berbers, Tuaregs, Ottomans and the Arabs, as well as the French colonists who first entered the range in 1914 and took control of the area in 1929. The independent spirit of the Toubou and the geopolitics of the region has complicated the exploration of the range as well as the ascent of its peaks. Tensions continued after Chad and Libya gained independence in the mid-20th century, with hostage-taking and armed struggles occurring amid disputes over the allocation of natural resources. The geopolitical situation and the lack of infrastructure has hampered the development of tourism.

The Saharomontane flora and fauna, which include the rhim gazelle and Barbary sheep, have adapted to the mountains, yet the climate has not always been as harsh. Greater biodiversity existed in the past, as evidenced by scenes portrayed in rock and parietal art found throughout the range, which date back several millennia, even before the arrival of the Toubou. The isolation of the Tibesti has sparked the cultural imagination in both art and literature.

==Toponymy==
The Tibesti Mountains are named for the Toubou people, also written &quot;Tibu&quot; or &quot;Tubu&quot;, that inhabit the area. In the Kanuri language, &quot;tu&quot; means &quot;rocks&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;bu&quot; means &quot;a person&quot; or &quot;dweller,&quot; and thus &quot;Toubou&quot; roughly translates to &quot;people of the mountains&quot; and &quot;Tibesti&quot; to the &quot;place where the mountain people live&quot;.

Most of the mountain names are derived from Arabic as well as the Tedaga and Dazaga languages. The term &quot;ehi&quot; precedes the names of peaks and rocky hills, &quot;emi&quot; precedes those of larger mountains, and &quot;tarso&quot; precedes high plateaus and gently-sloping mountainsides. For example, the Ehi Mousgou is a stratovolcano near Tarso Voon. The name Toussidé means &quot;that which killed the Tou,&quot; as in the Toubou, reflecting the danger of the still active volcano. The name of Bardaï, the principal town in the range, means &quot;cold&quot; in Chadian Arabic. In the Tedaga language, the town is known as &quot;Goumodi&quot;, which means &quot;red pass,&quot; signifying the color of the mountains at dusk.
==Geography==

===Location===

The mountains lie on the border between Chad and Libya, straddling the Chadian region of Tibesti and the Libyan districts of Murzuq and Kufra, around north of N&#x27;djamena and south-southeast of Tripoli. The range is adjacent to Niger and located approximately halfway between the Gulf of Sidra and Lake Chad, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. The East African Rift is to the east and the Cameroon line lies to the southwest.

The range is in length, in width, and spans . It draws a large triangle with sides of and vertices facing south, northwest and northeast in the heart of the Sahara, making it the largest mountain range of the desert.

===Topography===
The highest peak in the Tibesti Mountains, as well as the highest point in Chad and the Sahara Desert, is the Emi Koussi, located at the southern end of the range. Other prominent peaks include Pic Toussidé at and the Timi on its western side, the Tarso Yega, the Tarso Tieroko, the Ehi Mousgou, the Tarso Voon, the Ehi Sunni, and the Ehi Yéy near the center of the range. The Mouskorbé is a peak notable for its height in the northeastern part of the mountain range. The Bikku Bitti, the highest point in Libya, is nearby, on the other side of the border. The average elevation of the Tibesti Mountains is about ; sixty percent of its area exceeds in elevation.

The range includes five shield volcanoes with broad bases whose diameter can reach : Emi Koussi; Tarso Toon, which rises above sea level; Tarso Voon; Tarso Yega; and Tarso Toussidé, which culminates in the peak of the same name. Several of these peaks are topped with large calderas. Tarso Yega has the largest caldera, with a diameter of and a depth of approximately , while Tarso Voon has the deepest caldera, with a depth of approximately and a diameter of . They are complemented by four large lava dome complexes, high and several km wide, all located in the central part of the mountain range: Tarso Tieroko; Ehi Yéy; Ehi Mousgou; and Tarso Abeki, which rises to above sea level. These volcanic complexes are now considered inactive, but according to the Smithsonian Institution were active during the Holocene. Tarso Toussidé is an active volcano that has spewed lava over the past two millennia. Gases escaping from fumaroles on Toussidé are visible when evaporation is low. The volcano&#x27;s crater, Trou au Natron, is in diameter and deep. On the northwest side of Tarso Voon is the Soborom geothermal field, which contains mud pools and fumaroles that vent sulfuric acid. The sulfur has stained the surrounding soil bright colors. Fumaroles are also present at the Yi Yerra hot springs on Emi Koussi. Tarso Tôh was an active volcano in the early Holocene. The volcanic area of the Tibesti Mountains is located entirely in Chad; it covers about a third of the total area of the Tibesti Mountains and is responsible for between of rock.

The rest of the Tibesti Mountains consists of volcanic plateaus (&quot;tarsos&quot;), located between elevation, as well as lava fields and ejecta deposits. The plateaus are larger and more numerous in the east: the Tarso Emi Chi, the Tarso Aozi, the Tarso Ahon to the north of Emi Koussi, and the Tarso Mohi. In the center is Tarso Ourari at about . To the west, in the vicinity of Tarso Toussidé, is the aforementioned Tarso Tôh, a small plateau at just , and the even smaller Tarso Tamertiou at . The plateaus are strewn with volcanic spires and are separated by canyons that have been formed by the irregular flow of wadis. After often-violent rains, they see the formation of ephemeral streams and flora. The southern, southwestern and eastern slopes of the mountain range have a gentle rise, while the northern slope of the range is a cliff overlooking the vast Libyan desert pavement known as the &quot;Serir Tibesti&quot;.

===Hydrology===
Five rivers in the northern half of the Tibesti Mountains flow to Libya, while the southern half belongs to the endorheic basin of Lake Chad. However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may flow great distances through subterranean aquifers.

The wadis in the Tibesti are called &quot;enneris&quot;. The water mainly originates from the storms that periodically rage over the mountains. Their flow is highly variable. For example, the largest wadi, named Bardagué (or Enneri Zoumeri on its upstream portion) and located in the northern part of the range, recorded a flow of in 1954, yet over the next nine years it experienced four years of total drought, four years of flow less than and one year where three different flow rates were measured: .


Other major rivers cut into the mountains: the Enneri Yebige flows northward until its riverbed disappears on the &quot;Serir Tibesti&quot;, while Enneri Touaoul joins the south-flowing Enneri Ke to form Enneri Miski, which then disappears in the plains of Borkou. Their basins are separated by an high watershed that runs from Tarso Tieroko in the west to Tarso Mohi in the east. The Enneri Tijitinga is the longest wadi in the range, flowing some southward. It forms in the west of the range and peters out in the Bodélé Depression, as does Enneri Miski a little further to the east, along with other wadis such as the Enneri Korom and Enneri Aouei. Several rivers flow radially on the southern slopes of the Emi Koussi before seeping into the sands of Borkou and then reemerging at escarpments up to south of the summit, near the Ennedi Plateau.

At the bottom of many canyons are gueltas, wetlands that accumulate water mainly during storms. Above , &quot;enneri&quot; beds sometimes contain sequential pools of water that . The water is replenished several times a year during flooding, and salinity levels are low. The Mare de Zoui is a small permanent body of water above sea level, located in the northern part of the mountains in the wadi of the Enneri Bardagué, east of Bardaï. Supplied by sources upstream of the wadi, in heavy rains it overflows and spills into small wetlands.

The Yi Yerra hot springs is located on the southern flank of Emi Koussi at about elevation. Water emerges from the springs at . A dozen hot springs are also located at the Soborom geothermal field on the northwest side of Tarso Voon, where water emerges at temperatures ranging between .

===Geology===

The Tibesti Mountains are a large area of tectonic uplift that, according to contemporary theory, resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African Plate lithosphere, which is about thick. This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone. A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated.

The basement of the Tibesti is composed of granite, diorite and schist, one of six exposures of Precambrian crystalline rock in North Africa. These are overlaid by sandstone of the Paleozoic era, while the peaks consist of volcanic rock. The continental hotspot activity began as early as the Oligocene, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the Lower Miocene to the Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene. Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African Plate—roughly between per year since the Lower Miocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains. This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons. Early volcanic activity created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to thick. Basanite and andesite are also found in the volcanic layer. More recently in geologic time, volcanic activity has deposited dacite, rhyolite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite. This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume.

===Geomorphology===

Volcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases. In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area. The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy. The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions. In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast &quot;tarsos&quot;, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast. Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas. This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon. To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi. Emi Koussi increased in height. The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise. In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane. Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared. Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé. With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance.

The Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters have formed even more recently, with the former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas. Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi. there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé. Carbonate deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity.

The study of fluvial terraces has revealed coarse sand and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand. This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period. The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today. Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least deep during the Late Pleistocene. These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures. In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC.

===Climate===
The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year. In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air. Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti. However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry. In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems. For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw of rainfall. In general, the range receives less than of rainfall per year. However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example Trou au Natron receives annually. When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow. This occurs, on average, once every seven years.

The average monthly maximum temperature is in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is . Lows of are not uncommon. Bardaï, located above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between in January, between in April, and between in August. The combination of high temperatures and low humidity results in potentially high evaporation rates, ranging from in January to in May, parching many &quot;enneris&quot; before they can exit the mountain range.

==Flora and fauna==
Much like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert. As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara to the east. Most of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species. Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its flora and fauna, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested. Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and vegetation has suffered from overgrazing in the past.

===Flora===
The flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel and Afromontane vegetation. Biodiversity and endemism levels are higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation&#x27;s coverage is highly dependent on rainfall. Oases lie along the courses of the &quot;enneris&quot;, such as Enneri Yebige. These oases, which are more numerous to the north and west of the range, are scattered with acacia, figs, palms and tamarisks. Most gueltas are lined with macrophytes—including smooth flatsedge and branched horsetail—and bryophytes—including &quot;Oxyrrhynchium speciosum&quot; and species of &quot;Bryum&quot;. Egyptian acacia grows near these water basins. Saharan myrtle and oleander grow between elevations of in the western part of the range, while Nile tamarisk grows at similar elevations in its northern part. Downstream, where the current of the &quot;enneris&quot; is slower and the riverbed is deeper, there are dense thickets of Athel tamarisk and arak.

Around the edge of the Tibesti, where the canyons exit the range, are doum palms. The banks of Mare de Zoui are home to dense stands of reeds (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot; and &quot;Typha capensis&quot;), along with sedges (&quot;Scirpoides holoschoenus&quot;), sea rush, toad rush and branched horsetail, while pondweed grows in the open water. Although the lake appears rich in phytoplankton, it has not been thoroughly studied. To the south and southwest of the range, between elevation, the wadis support woody species characteristic of the Sahel, such as Egyptian balsam, grey-leaved cordia, red-leaved fig, sycamore fig, wonderboom and gay acacia. &quot;Chrysopogon plumulosus&quot; is the most common grass in the area. Other plants have more Mediterranean characteristics, such as &quot;Globularia alypum&quot; and lavender or the more tropical sweet Indian mallow and least snout-bean. The liverwort &quot;Plagiochasma rupestre&quot; is found around the wadis at these elevations, as are mosses of the genera &quot;Fissidens&quot;, &quot;Gymnostomum&quot; and &quot;Timmiella&quot;.

Saharomontane grasslands are found on the slopes, plateaus and the upper portions of the wadis at elevations between . They are dominated by &quot;Stipagrostis obtusa&quot; and &quot;Aristida caerulescens&quot;, as well some &quot;Eragrostis papposa&quot; locally. In addition, shrubs represented by jointed anabis, &quot;Fagonia flamandii&quot; and &quot;Zilla spinosa&quot; dot this environment. On the sheltered upper slopes of Emi Koussi is the endemic grass &quot;Eragrostis kohorica&quot;, named after the volcano&#x27;s crater.

The vegetation above consists of dwarf shrubs, which are generally limited to in height and do not exceed . The shrubbery consists of the species &quot;Pentzia monodiana&quot;, &quot;Artemisia tilhoana&quot; and &quot;Ephedra tilhoana&quot;. At the highest elevations of the Tibesti, tree heath grows from moist crevices formed by early lava flows, while 24 different species of moss provide substrate for the tree heath. Various genera of mosses also grow around fumaroles, including &quot;Fissidens&quot;, &quot;Campylopus&quot;, &quot;Gymnostomum&quot; and &quot;Trichostomum&quot;. Lichens, though rare in the dry climate of the Tibesti, also grow at these elevations, with green rock shield, scrambled-egg lichen, sunken disk lichen and &quot;Squamarina crassa&quot; found on the highest peaks.

===Fauna===
Mammals abound in the Tibesti. Bovids include the endangered addax along with the dorcas gazelle, rhim gazelle and a significant population of Barbary sheep. Rodents are the most represented order of mammals, and include the spiny mouse, bushy-tailed jird and the North African gerbil. Also present are cats such as the African wildcat and, more rarely, the cheetah, as well as several canine species, including the golden jackal, fennec fox and Rüppell&#x27;s fox. The striped hyena may also occupy the range. African wild dogs formerly roamed the range, although these populations are now extirpated. Olive baboons, found as recently as 1960, are now likely extirpated as well. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the Egyptian mouse-tailed bat, Egyptian slit-faced bat and the trident bat. The Cape hare and the rock hyrax also populate the area.

Reptiles and amphibians, on the other hand, are sparse. Snake species include the braid snake and the long-nosed worm snake. Among the lizards are Bibron&#x27;s agama, the ringed wall gecko and the Sudan mastigure. Mid-20th-century herpetological studies noted the presence of brown frogs and true toads.

Many resident birds can be found in the Tibesti. These include the crowned sandgrouse, bar-tailed lark, blackstart, desert lark, desert sparrow, fulvous babbler, greater hoopoe-lark, Lichtenstein&#x27;s sandgrouse, pale crag martin, trumpeter finch and the white-crowned wheatear. The Tibesti massif has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

The gueltas are flushed periodically each year by stormwater, maintaining low salinity and supporting several species of freshwater fish. These include the African sharptooth catfish, East African red-finned barb, Tibesti labeo (&quot;Labeo tibestii&quot;, an endemic species) and the redbelly tilapia.

==Population==
The town of Bardaï, located on the northern flank of the mountains at an elevation of , is the capital of the Tibesti region. It is connected to the town of Zouar, to the southwest, by a track that crosses Tarso Toussidé. The village of Omchi is accessible from Bardaï via Aderké, or from the town of Aouzou via Irbi. These rough tracks extend southward towards Yebbi Souma and Yebbi Bou, and then follow the course of Enneri Misky. The eastern half of the Tibesti is cut off from the western half, and the eastern village of Aozi is accessible from Libya via Ouri. Zouar has an airport, as does Bardaï at Zougra. Bardaï also has a hospital, although the medical supply is very much dependent upon the prevailing political situation.

The vast majority of the population is Teda, one of the two ethnicities of the Toubou people. However, some clans are Daza, the other Toubou ethnicity, who left their traditional homes in the lowlands to the south and moved north to the Tibesti. The Toubou live primarily in northern Chad, but also in southern Libya and eastern Niger. The Toubou language has two main dialects, Tedaga, spoken by the Teda, and Dazaga, spoken by the Daza. Despite their differences, the two Toubou groups generally identify as a single ethnic group. The Toubou elect a chief, the &quot;Derdé&quot;, from the Tomagra clan, although never from the same family consecutively. Historically, individual clans rarely had more than a thousand members and were quite dispersed throughout the Tibesti. the population of the Tibesti was officially estimated at 21,000 inhabitants. that number has risen to 54,000 inhabitants. Yet the Toubou, in general, are semi-nomadic, moving between the mountains and other regions, and thus the Tibesti may have no more than 10,000 to 15,000 permanent residents.

Traditional Toubou life is punctuated by the seasons, divided between animal husbandry and agriculture. Twentieth-century anthropological studies show Toubou, particularly around palm groves, living in primitive round huts built with stone walls bound by mortar or clay, or built from clay or salt blocks. In the highlands, the buildings were built of stone, forming circles in diameter and high, which served as shelters for goats, or as granaries, or as human shelters and defense structures. In other cases, the Toubou lived in tents that could be easily moved between the fields and the palm groves.

==History==

===Human settlement===
There is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the Stone Age, when denser paleovegetation facilitated human habitation. The Toubou were settled in the region by the 5th century BC and eventually established trade relations with the Carthaginian civilization. Around this time, Herodotus mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled &quot;Aethiopians&quot;, and described them as having a language akin to the &quot;cry of bats&quot;.

Herodotus further remarked on a conflict between the Toubou and the civilization of Garamantes based in present-day Libya. Between AD 83 and 92, a Roman traveler, likely a trader, named Julius Maternus, explored the territory of the Tibesti Mountains with, or under the charge of, the king of Garamantes. The Tibesti are suspected by modern historians to have been part of an unidentified country named Agisymba, and Maternus&#x27;s expedition may have been part of a broader military campaign by Garamantes against the populace of Agisymba.

In the 12th century, the geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi spoke of a &quot;country of Zaghawa negroes&quot;, or camel herders, that had converted to Islam. The historian Ibn Khaldun described the Toubou in the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Al-Maqrizi and Leo Africanus referred to the &quot;country of the Berdoa&quot;, meaning Bardaï, the former associating the Toubou with the Berbers and the latter describing them as Numidian relatives of the Tuareg.

The Toubou settled in the Tibesti in several waves. Generally, newcomers either killed or absorbed the previous clans after battles that were often both long-lasting and bloody. The Teda clans, considered indigenous to the area, were first established around Enneri Bardagué. Namely, these clans were the Cerdegua, Zouia, Kossseda (nicknamed &quot;yobat&quot; or &quot;hunters of well water&quot;), and possibly the Ederguia, although the Ederguia&#x27;s origin may be Zaghawa and only go back to the 17th century. These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced &quot;Ghazw&quot;. It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan.

There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries, possibly having fled the Kanem-Bornu Empire in the southwest. These later Daza arrivals include the Arna Souinga in the south, Gouboda in the center-west, Tchioda and Dirsina in the west, Torama in the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, &quot;descendants of the chief,&quot; the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north. The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers. Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities. Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided with more or less pronounced wet and dry periods.

Several clans with traditions similar to those of the Donzas of the Borkou region, south of the Tibesti, settled in the range in the 16th and 17th centuries. These include the Keressa and Odobaya in the west, Foctoa in the northwest and northeast, and Emmeouia in the north. Several other clans—the Mogode in the west, Terintere in the north, Tozoba in the center, and Tegua and Mada in the south—are originally clans of the Bideyat people who immigrated from the Ennedi Plateau, southeast of Tibesti, around the same time. The Mada, however, have since largely emigrated to Borkou, Kaouar and Kanem.

The early 17th century also saw the arrival of three clans from the region of Kufra to the northeast. The Taïzera settled in the plateau in the center and west of the mass, probably fleeing the Arab push into present-day Libya. According to oral tradition, their leader was initially rejected by the Daza clans and lived in isolation until winning the favor of a Dirsina woman. The Mahadena occupy the northeast quarter of the range and are likely from the Jalo oasis of Cyrenaica and thus related to the Mogharba Arab tribes, although an alternative hypothesis is that they are of Bideyat origin. Following years of conflict, a branch of the Mahadena clan, the Fortena, withdrew to the western margin of the Tibesti. The Fortena Mado (&quot;Red Fortena&quot;) settled there, while the Fortena Yasko (&quot;Black Fortena&quot;) pushed further west to Kaouar.

The Tuareg people intermixed with the Toubou clans, especially with the early Goga clan, which produced the Gouboda, and with the later Arna clan, which produced the Mormorea. In both instances, the new clans were placed under the authority of suzerain clans of the traditionally feudal Tuareg, although they were eventually assimilated into the Toubou majority.

===Regional relations and colonization===
In the mid-19th century the Ottoman Empire began a campaign of territorial conquest across northern Africa from its regional headquarters in Libya, yet was unable to subdue the Tibesti. In 1890, to the chagrin of the Turks, France and Great Britain signed a declaration recognizing a French zone of influence in northern Africa from the Mediterranean Sea down to Lake Chad. In response, the Toubou allied with the Senussi Arabs of Libya and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the French Colonial Army. As the Sennussis&#x27; influence moved southward, so did their headquarters, which in 1899 was moved to the town of Gouro on the southeast flank of the range. The Senussi founded a Zawiya in Bardaï, which quickly promoted the total Islamization of the Tibesti. At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derdé, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911. These garrisons fell apart a few months later when the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops.

While the Italians occupied the Fezzan, a French column entered the Tibesti in early 1914 from Kaouar. The region was at the heart of a dispute between the colonial powers, with the Italian Empire to the north and French West Africa to the south. During World War I, a Senussi revolt forced the Italians to temporarily withdraw from the Fezzan and the northeastern part of the Tibesti. Likewise, fierce resistance from the Toubou forced the French troops to retreat southward from the Tibesti in 1916. After a period of internal disorder, the Tibesti was reconquered by the French colonial empire in 1929, and the region was placed under the administration of French Equatorial Africa. Libya gained its independence from Italy in 1947, and was released from British and French oversight in 1951.

===Modern history===

====Chadian Civil War====
Chad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by François Tombalbaye imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti. Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September. In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi. Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government. These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979.

In 1968, the French Army, at the request of Tombalbaye, intervened in an attempt to put an end to the rebellion. However, French General Edouard Cortadellas admitted their attempts to quell the Toubou were essentially hopeless, remarking, &quot;I believe we should draw a line below [the Tibesti region] and leave them to their stones. We can never subdue them.&quot; The French therefore focused their intervention on the center and east of the country, leaving the Tibesti region largely alone.

In 1969, Goukouni Oueddei, a Teda leader, and Hissène Habré, a Daza leader, emerged from the Tibesti to form the Second Liberation Army. In April 1974, the Second Liberation Army captured Bardaï from the Chadian government and took hostage the French archeologist Françoise Claustre, German doctor Christophe Staewen and Marc Combe, an assistant to Claustre&#x27;s husband, and held them in the mountains. Staewen&#x27;s wife and two soldiers of the Chadian army were killed. The West German government quickly paid the ransom and Staewen was released. The French government sent the military officer Pierre Galopin to negotiate with the rebels, but he was captured by the rebels and executed in April 1975. Marc Combe was able to escape in May 1975. The remaining hostages were released in January 1977 in Tripoli after France acceded to the rebels&#x27; ransom demand. The hostage incident, known as &quot;L&#x27;affaire Claustre&quot;, caused a rift between the French and Chadian governments.

Another rift formed between Goukouni and Habré, which by 1976 had spread to the Second Liberation Army, leaving one side commanded by Habré and the other commanded by Goukouni and supported by Libya. In June 1977, Goukouni&#x27;s forces attacked the Chadian government stronghold in Bardaï. The rebels also attacked Zouar. These battles resulted in the death of 300 government troops. Bardaï surrendered to the rebels on July 4, while Zouar was evacuated. The Chadian government, led by Félix Malloum since Tombalbaye&#x27;s overthrow in 1975, signed a peace agreement with Habré in 1978, although fighting with other rebel groups, many aligned with Libya, continued.

====Tibesti War====
In 1978, war broke out between Chad and Libya ostensibly over the Aouzou Strip, a borderland between Chad and Libya that extends into the Tibesti Mountains and is rumored to contain uranium deposits. In 1980, Libya used the strip as a base from which stage an attack, led by Goukouni, on the Chadian capital, N&#x27;Djamena, located in southern Chad and controlled by Habré. N&#x27;Djamena was toppled in December; however, under considerable international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habré&#x27;s Armed Forces of the North (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces. Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad. Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions. Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces.

By 1986, following a series of military defeats, the GUNT had begun to disintegrate along with relations between Goukouni and Libya. In December, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, which spurred his troops to attack Libyan positions in the Tibesti, forcing the Libyans to withdraw. Libya sought to retake Bardaï and Zouar, and sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds. The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces. Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the broader campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity never before seen in Chad. After a series of defeats in northeastern Chad, Libyan forces withdrew fully from the Tibesti in March 1987.

====MDJT War====

Following a decade of relative peace, in late 1997 the Tibesti saw the formation of the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a rebel group opposed to Chadian president Idriss Déby. Numbering around 1,000 fighters at its peak between 2000 and 2001, and financed by Libyan Teda clans and the Libyan government, the MDJT was able to take control of several towns in the Tibesti. Battles with the Chadian National Army (ANT) were particularly violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Bardaï. Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population.

Between 1998 and 2010 the MDJT had established a weak government in the Tibesti region, functionally independent from that of Chad. In 2002, however, weakened by its isolation in the Tibesti and from a series of military defeats, the MDJT split into several factions following the death of its leader, Youssouf Togoïmi. In 2005, under pressure from Libya, the &quot;most legitimate&quot; MDJT faction signed a peace agreement with the Chadian government, yet the war continued, albeit at a lower intensity. From 2009 to 2010, the last of the MDJT rebels surrendered to the Chadian government. The legacy of decades of war continues to burden the Tibesti with a lack of government, a warrior culture, and a landscape strewn with thousands of landmines.

====Gold rush====
Gold was discovered in the Tibesti Mountains in 2012, attracting prospectors from across the Sahel. The arrival of migrants has led to violent conflicts with the Teda locals, a problem exacerbated by an influx of weaponry to the region due to the wars in Darfur and Libya. Violence has also arisen as a result of disputes between the miners themselves; for example, around 100 people were killed in May 2022 over a &quot;banal dispute&quot; between miners. The increased migration has also increased drug traffic, with the Tibesti lying along the trans-Saharan smuggling route for South American cocaine destined for Europe. Nevertheless, the gold discovery has benefited the impoverished region economically. Many Tibesti residents have been able to purchase goods such as cars, televisions and satellite telephones that they could not otherwise afford. &quot;If by the grace of God, gold had not appeared we would not even have anything to eat&quot;, remarked one Tibesti prospector.

===Scientific exploration and research===
Due to its isolation and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists. The German Gustav Nachtigal was the first European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869. While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his expedition was fiercely opposed by the Toubou, and his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years. Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and petrology of the range. The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Marguerite, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935. Le Cœur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research. French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957. In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research was slowed due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974.

Although the Tibesti is one of the world&#x27;s most significant examples of intracontinental volcanism, ongoing political instability and the presence of landmines means that, today, geologic research often must be conducted on the basis of satellite images and comparison with research on Martian volcanoes. Little public geologic research had been conducted in the Tibesti Mountains until the work of Gourgaud and Vincent in 2004; however, an expedition in 2015 sought to assess the feasibility of establishing a new geoscience research station in Bardaï.

===Climbing history===
Although not an alpine climb, Gustav Nachtigal ascended to elevation as he traversed a pass abutting Pic Toussidé during his exploration of the Tibesti in 1869. The Englishman Wilfred Thesiger summited the highest mountain in the range, the Emi Koussi, in 1938. In 1948, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research mounted an expedition under Edouard Wyss-Dunant, which scaled both the peak and needle of Botoum, at and , respectively.

In 1957, Peter Steele led a University of Cambridge expedition that sought to conquer Tarso Tieroko, which Thesiger had described as &quot;probably the most beautiful peak in Tibesti&quot;. After climbing two peaks situated on a ridge to the north, they attempted Tieroko, but just from the summit, they were faced with a vertical, crumbling rock wall and were forced to descend. Following this defeat, they took the opportunity to climb Emi Koussi, 19 years after its first ascent by Thesiger, and also Pic Woubou, a prominent spire located between Bardaï and Aouzou. Seven years later, in 1965, a team led by the Englishman Doug Scott succeeded in climbing Tieroko.

In 1963, an expedition under the Italian Guido Monzino ascended a peak in the massif of the Aiguilles of Sissé which, despite rising only above ground level, proved &quot;very difficult&quot;. The Englishman Eamon &quot;Ginge&quot; Fullen scaled Bikku Bitti, the highest peak in Libya at , in 2005, capping a successful &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; attempt. Due to the unstable political situation, mountaineering in the Tibesti remains a challenging endeavor today.
==Economy==

===Natural resources===
Although gold was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012. Diamonds have also been found. The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of uranium, tin, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lead, zinc and copper. Amazonite is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes. Salt is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou.

The Soborom geothermal field, the name of which means &quot;healing water&quot;, is known to locals for its medicinal qualities; its pools are rumored to cure dermatitis and rheumatism after several days of soaking. Mare de Zoui and its surroundings were rarely visited, aside from a nearby oasis. However, there are numerous small oases on the plains of Borkou, near Emi Koussi, which are extensively exploited. This water is thought to be sourced from the Tibesti Mountains, from where it flows underground before surfacing at these springs.

===Agriculture===
There are accessible oases to the west and north of the range. Where mosquitoes do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar where, by the 1950s, indigenous plant species had been largely replaced by some 56,000 date palms (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;). The dates are harvested between late July and early August. In winter, when reserves are depleted, it is not uncommon for the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed. Some native palm species remain, such as the doum palm (&quot;Hyphaene thebaica&quot;), from which the hard yet vaguely-sweet fruit rinds are collected, ground and consumed, despite their low nutritional value. The banks of the &quot;enneris&quot; grow desert gourd (&quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot;), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour. Women are customarily responsible for gathering wild grains on the &quot;tarsos&quot; in August.

Horticulture is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods. The palm groves can also grow wheat, millet and maize, but the crops are spotty and sometimes swept away by flooding. in total, including barley, the Tibesti produced of cereals each year. On the plains of Borkou, some fields are irrigated, where cattle, goats and dromedaries can drink. In the 1950s, it was reported that goats and, more rarely, sheep numbered 50,000 heads, while 8,000 dromedaries and 7,000 donkeys were being raised in the range. Since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, dromedaries have come to dominate at the expense of cattle. Most animals spend the winter on the plateaus or in the high valleys. They descend into the lower valleys in February, just after the sowing of wheat, and then return in June to allow harvest. Fishing is possible in the water holes. Traditionally, agricultural product was traded once a year in exchange for fabrics.

===Tourism===
As the Sahara&#x27;s highest mountain range, with geothermal features, a distinctive culture, and numerous rock and parietal artworks, the Tibesti has tourism potential. However, tourist accommodations are limited at best. In the early 2010s, the French adventure travel company Point-Afrique financed the repair of the airport at Faya-Largeau, some southeast of the Tibesti, and established direct charter flights between Faya and Marseille. Although the flights mainly brought tourists destined for the Ounianga Lakes UNESCO World Heritage Site, there was considerable hope that they would also open the gates for tourism in the Tibesti. For example, the Chadian government invested in a tourist camp along with walled pavilions in Bardaï. Yet, following the Libyan Crisis and France&#x27;s intervention in Mali, the French government pressured tour operators to prevent French tourists from venturing into the Sahara, and the flights ended.

 there are essentially only two tour operators in Chad, run by Chadians and Italians and both based in N&#x27;Djamena, which offer all the tours that exist in Chad, including trips to the Tibesti. Tours are typically multi-week affairs, with tourists accommodated in tents. They include exposure to Toubou cultural traditions and to the Tibesti&#x27;s rock and parietal art. Continuing civil unrest and the presence of landmines pose a danger to tourists, and, despite the occasional tour group, the Tibesti remains one of the most isolated places on Earth.

===Conservation===
The resources available for conservation in the Tibesti are limited. In 2006, various non-governmental working groups proposed a protected area to preserve the area&#x27;s rhim gazelle and Barbary sheep populations. The protected area would be modeled after the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve to the south. However, due to economic and political barriers, the project has not moved beyond the proposal stage. Nevertheless, the establishment of two World Heritage Sites in northern Chad in 2012 and 2016 has renewed hope that a similar feat might be achieved in the Tibesti.

==Art and literature==
===Rock and parietal art===

The Tibesti Mountains are renowned for their rock and parietal art. Around 200 engraving sites and 100 painting sites have been identified. Many date as early as the 6th millennium BC, long before the arrival of the Toubou. The art has suffered the effects of time, including weathering from sand blown by the wind. The earliest works often portray animals that have since died out in the region due to climate change, including elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and giraffes. More recent art includes ostriches, antelopes, gazelles, baboons and sheep. Later works, dated less than 2000 years old, portray domesticated animals, such as oxen and camels.

Other engravings portray warriors dressed in feathers or spiked ornaments and armed with bows, shields, assegai, or traditional knives. Still others portray celebrations and scenes from everyday life. The walls of a canyon near Bardaï have engravings that measure over in height, including that of the &quot;man of Gonoa&quot;, Gonoa being the name of the &quot;enneri&quot; that runs through the valley. These primarily show hunting scenes. The Tibesti art is unique in the Sahara because of the absence of inscriptions, the relative lack of chariots, and the low representation of camels and horses until comparatively recently.

===Other works===
The Tibesti Mountains have inspired several contemporary works of art and literature. The volcanic spires of the Tibesti, along with a stylized sheep&#x27;s head, were displayed on a 20 CFA franc postage stamp issued by Republic of Chad in 1962. In 1989, French painter and sculptor Jean Vérame used the natural surroundings of the Tibesti to create multidimensional land art works by painting rocks.

The Tibesti range was featured in the 1958 short story &quot;Le Mura di Anagoor&quot; (&quot;The Walls of Anagoor&quot;) by the Italian novelist Dino Buzzati. In the story, a local guide offers to show a traveler the walls of a great city that is absent from the maps. The city is exceedingly opulent, yet exists in total autarky and does not submit to higher authority. The traveler waits many years, in vain, to enter the Tibesti city.

<text>CSS &quot;Shenandoah, formerly Sea King and later El Majidi&quot;, was an iron-framed, teak-planked, full-rigged sailing ship with auxiliary steam power chiefly known for her actions under Lieutenant Commander James Waddell as part of the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was originally a British merchant ship launched as &quot;Sea King&quot; on August 17, 1863, but was later repurposed as one of the most feared commerce raiders in the Confederate Navy. For twelve-and-a-half months from 1864 to 1865, the ship undertook commerce raiding around the world in an effort to disrupt the Union&#x27;s economy, capturing and sinking or bonding 38 merchant vessels, mostly whaling ships from New Bedford, Massachusetts. She finally surrendered on the River Mersey, Liverpool, United Kingdom, on November 6, 1865, six months after the war had ended.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; is also known for having fired the last shot of the Civil War, across the bow of a whaler in waters off the Aleutian Islands.
==History and mission==
The ship had three names and many owners in her lifetime of nine years. She was designed as an auxiliary composite passenger cargo ship of 1,018 tons and built in 1863 by Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons, Glasgow, Scotland, for Robertson &amp; Co., Glasgow, to be named &quot;Sea King&quot;. The ship was intended for the East Asia tea trade and as a troop transport. While she was being fitted out at the builders, US representatives assessed the ship for purchase. After change of owner and a number of trips to the Far East carrying cargo and to New Zealand transporting troops to the New Zealand Wars, the Confederate navy assessed and purchased her from Wallace Bros of Liverpool. The purchase, made in secret, was completed on 18 October 1864, and the next day the ship was renamed CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. The ship was to be converted into an armed cruiser with a mission to capture and destroy Union merchant ships. Liverpool was the unofficial home port of the Confederate overseas fleet, and Confederate Commander James Dunwoody Bulloch was based in the city. The city provided ships, crews, munitions, and provisions of war.

&quot;Sea King&quot; sailed from London on 8 October 1864, ostensibly for Bombay on a trading voyage. The supply steamer &quot;Laurel&quot; sailed from Liverpool the same day. The two ships rendezvoused at Funchal, Madeira, with &quot;Laurel&quot; carrying the officers and the nucleus of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s crew, together with naval guns, ammunition, and ship&#x27;s stores. &quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s commander, Lieutenant James Iredell Waddell, supervised her conversion to a man-of-war in nearby waters. However, Waddell was barely able to bring his crew to even half strength, despite additional volunteers from the merchant sailors on &quot;Sea King&quot; and from &quot;Laurel&quot;.

The new Confederate cruiser was commissioned on 19 October 1864, lowering the Union Jack and raising the &quot;Stainless Banner&quot;, and was renamed CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;.

As developed in the Confederate Navy Department and by its agents in Europe, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was tasked to strike at the Union&#x27;s economy and &quot;seek out and utterly destroy&quot; commerce in areas yet undisturbed. Captain Waddell began seeking enemy merchant ships on the Indian Ocean route between the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, and in the Pacific whaling fleet. En route to the Cape, the Confederates captured six prizes. Five were burned or scuttled, after the crew and passengers had been removed. The sixth was bonded and used to transport the prisoners to Bahia, Brazil, where they were released. On the 2 January 1865, the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; briefly stopped at Île Saint-Paul, and some of the crew debarked to explore the island and gather food.

===Colony of Victoria stopover===
Still short-handed, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; arrived at Melbourne, Colony of Victoria, on January 25, 1865, where she filled her complement and her storerooms. She also signed on 40 crew members who had been stowaways from Melbourne. They were not enlisted until the ship was outside the Colony of Victoria&#x27;s territorial waters. The Shipping Articles show all 40 crew members had enlisted on the day of her departure from Melbourne, February 18, 1865. However, 19 of Waddell&#x27;s crew deserted at Melbourne, some giving statements of their service to the United States Consul.

===Pacific raids===

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; took only one prize in the Indian Ocean, but hunting became more profitable after refitting in Melbourne. En route to the North Pacific whaling grounds, on April 3–4, Waddell burned four whalers in the Caroline Islands. After a three-week cruise to the ice and fog of the Sea of Okhotsk yielded only a single prize, due to a warning which had preceded him, Waddell headed north past the Aleutian Islands into the Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. &quot;Shenandoah&quot; then proceeded to capture 11 more prizes.

The rich whaling grounds in the Bering Sea between Siberia and Alaska had been a safe haven for Yankee whalers for most of the American Civil War. This prosperous whaling ended in the spring and summer of 1865 when &quot;Shenandoah&quot; arrived and captured 20 of the 58 Yankee whalers working there. These whalers were destroyed more than a month after CSA President Jefferson Davis was captured on May 10, 1865.

On June 27, 1865, Waddell learned from a prize, &quot;Susan &amp; Abigail&quot;, that General Robert E. Lee had surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia almost three months earlier at Appomattox Court House. &quot;Susan &amp; Abigail&quot;&#x27;s captain produced a San Francisco newspaper reporting the flight from Richmond of the Confederate government 10 weeks previously. However, the newspaper also contained President Davis&#x27; proclamation that the &quot;war would be carried on with renewed vigor.&quot; Waddell then captured 10 more whalers in the space of seven hours just below the Arctic Circle.

On August 3, 1865, Waddell learned of the war&#x27;s definite end when &quot;Shenandoah&quot; encountered the Liverpool barque &quot;Barracouta&quot;, which was bound for San Francisco. Waddell was heading to the city to attack it, believing it weakly defended. He learned of the surrender of Johnston&#x27;s army on April 26, and Kirby Smith&#x27;s army on May 26, and most crucially of the capture of President Davis. Captain Waddell then knew the war was over.

Captain Waddell lowered the Confederate flag, and &quot;Shenandoah&quot; underwent physical alteration. Her guns were dismounted and stowed below deck, and her hull was painted to look like an ordinary merchant ship.

==Surrender==


Regardless of Davis&#x27;s proclamation and knowing the unreliability of newspapers at the time, Captain Waddell and his crew knew returning to a U.S. port would mean facing a court sympathetic to the Union. News of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination also served to further diminish any expectation for leniency. The crew predicted that surrendering to federal authorities would run the risk of being tried in a U.S. court and hanged as pirates. Commerce raiders were not included in the reconciliation and the amnesty that Confederate soldiers were given. Perhaps more importantly, Waddell would have been aware that the U.S. government no longer had to consider the threat of Confederate retaliation against Union prisoners while it determined his crew&#x27;s fate. Likely not known to Waddell was that Captain Raphael Semmes of had managed to escape charges of piracy by surrendering on May 1, 1865, as an army general under Joseph E. Johnston. Semmes&#x27;s former sailors surrendered as artillerymen.

Captain Waddell eventually decided to surrender his ship at the port of Liverpool, where Confederate Commander Bulloch was stationed.

===Last lowering of Confederate flag===
CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; sailed from off the west coast of Mexico via Cape Horn to Liverpool, a voyage of three months and over and was all the while pursued by Union vessels. She anchored at the Mersey Bar at the mouth of the estuary awaiting a pilot to board her to guide the ship up the river and into the enclosed docks. The pilot refused to take the ship, which was not flying any flag, into Liverpool; the crew raised the Confederate flag. CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; sailed up the River Mersey with the flag fully flying to crowds on the riverbanks.

The &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; reported the event on Tuesday, 7 November 1865:

 happened to be anchored in mid-river between Toxteth in Liverpool and Tranmere in Birkenhead. Captain Waddell maneuvered his ship near to the British man-of-war, dropping anchor. CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was surrendered by Captain Waddell to Captain Paynter of HMS &quot;Donegal&quot; on 6 November 1865. The Confederate flag was lowered again for the last time, under the watch of a Royal Navy detachment and the crew.

CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; had struck her colors twice. This marked the last surrender of the American Civil War and the last official lowering of the Confederate flag. The very last act of the Civil War was Captain Waddell walking up the steps of Liverpool Town Hall with a letter to present to the mayor surrendering his ship to the UK government. &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was the only Confederate warship to circumnavigate the globe.

The United States Naval War Records published in 1894:

After the surrender, CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was berthed in the partially constructed Herculaneum Dock awaiting her fate. Once the international legalities were settled, she was turned over to the United States government.

===Fate of the crew===
After the surrender of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to the British government, a decision had to be made of what to do with the Confederate crew, knowing the consequences of piracy charges. Clearly many of the crew originated from the United Kingdom and its colonies and were at risk of being considered pirates, and three had swum ashore in the cold November waters fearing the worst.

After a full investigation by law officers of the Crown, it was decided that the officers and crew did not infringe the rules of war or the laws of nations to justify being held as prisoners, so they were unconditionally released.

Sometime in December 1865, crew members S.S. Lee, Orris M. Brown, John T. Mason and W.C. Whittle sailed from Liverpool to Buenos Aires, via Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo. After prospecting for a while, they went to Rosario, upon Paraná River, and near there bought a small place and began farming. As the animosity of the US government began to soften towards them, Brown and Mason returned home, followed later by Lee and Whittle.

On returning home, Mason took a law course at the University of Virginia, graduated, and was successful at his profession. He settled in Baltimore, and married Miss Helen Jackson, of New York, daughter of the late Lieutenant Alonzo Jackson of the U.S. Navy.

Whittle returned home to Virginia from Buenos Aires in 1867. Born in Norfolk, Virginia in 1840, an 1858 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and an officer in the U.S. Navy before resigning his commission to accept a commission in the Confederate States Navy, Whittle was appointed captain of one of the Bay line steamers running between Baltimore, Norfolk and Portsmouth in 1868 shortly after returning to Virginia and continued in this capacity until 1890. After, he was a Superintendent for the Norfolk and Western Railway Company. In 1902, he became an organizer of the Virginia Bank and Trust Company, Virginia Bank and Trust Building, and served as its vice president and one of its directors thereafter.

Born in 1824, Captain Waddell was a former U.S. Navy officer with decades of sailing experience and a Mexican–American War naval combat veteran before resigning his commission to accept a commission in the Confederate States Navy. He returned from England to the United States in 1875 to captain &quot;San Francisco&quot; for the Pacific Mail Company. He later took command of a force that policed the oyster fleets in the Chesapeake Bay. In 1886, Waddell died of a brain disorder and was buried at St. Anne&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Annapolis, Maryland.

Dr. Frederick J. McNulty, the ship&#x27;s assistant surgeon, eventually became a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as Superintendent of the City Lunatic Asylum at Austin Farm and, later, opened there a private sanitarium called Pine Grove Retreat at Roslindale while continuing to reside at 706 Huntington Avenue, Boston. He became a primary historical source for chroniclers of the actions of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. Whittle recounts that McNulty, a man of irascible temper, laid the ship&#x27;s barber out with a single blow when the barber shoved shaving soap in his mouth as part of the crew&#x27;s hazing of the ship&#x27;s officers in celebration of crossing the equator. McNulty enlisted as a surgical officer in the Chilean Navy immediately after the surrender of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and later in 1869 accepted a commission in the Cuban Patriot Army, but was repeatedly prevented from traveling to join the Army by U.S. government authorities before settling in Boston in 1879. McNulty is variously reported to have been a native of Ireland, the District of Columbia and Richmond, Virginia, but was most likely Irish. He graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in the District of Columbia and lived in Richmond, Virginia before resigning his commission in the medical service of the U.S. Navy to accept a commission in the Confederate States Navy. McNulty died at his home in Boston on June 14, 1897, at the age of 62.

==Fate==
After her crew surrendered her to the British government at Liverpool on 6 November 1865, the British handed &quot;Shenandoah&quot; over to the United States government. The ship was sold to Matthew Isaac Wilson of Liverpool.

In 1867 Wilson sold her to Majid bin Said, the first Sultan of Zanzibar, who renamed her &quot;El Majidi&quot; after himself. On 15 April 1872 a hurricane hit Zanzibar. &quot;El Majidi&quot; was one of six ships owned by Seyed Burgash that were blown ashore and wrecked. Her crew were rescued. She was refloated on 7 July with assistance from . After temporary repairs she sailed on 10 September 1872 from Zanzibar to Bombay with 130 passengers and crew. She developed holes and took on water, sinking a few days later. &quot;El Majidi&quot; was subsequently repaired. She foundered in the Gulf of Aden off Socotra, Aden Governorate in November 1879. There were a few survivors. She was on a voyage from Zanzibar to Bombay, India, where she was to undergo repairs.

==Legacy==

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; had remained at sea for 12 months and 17 days, traversed 58,000 miles (carrying the Confederate flag around the globe for the only time) and sank or captured 38 ships, mostly whalers, all of them American civilian merchant vessels. Waddell took close to one thousand prisoners without a single war casualty among his crew; two men died of disease. The ship was never involved in conflict against any Union Naval vessel. The Confederate cruiser claimed more than 20 prizes valued at nearly $1,400,000 (). In an important development in international law, the U.S. government pursued claims (collectively called the Alabama Claims) against the British government and, following a court of arbitration, won heavy damages.

===Battle ensign===

The battle ensign of CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; is unique amongst the flags of the Confederate States of America as it was the only Confederate flag to circumnavigate the Earth during the Confederacy, and it was the last Confederate flag to be lowered by a combatant unit in the Civil War (in mid-river on the River Mersey at Liverpool, UK, on November 6, 1865).

&quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s battle ensign has been in the Museum of the Confederacy&#x27;s collection since 1907 and is currently on display. Lieutenant Dabney [Minor] Scales CSN, gave the flag to a cousin, Eliza Hull Maury, for safekeeping. Eliza Hull Maury was a daughter of, and Richard Launcelot Maury was the eldest son of, Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury. Colonel Richard Launcelot Maury CSA, Eliza&#x27;s brother, brought the flag from England in 1873, and donated it to the museum in 1907. The flag itself measures .

<text>A tripwire is a passive triggering mechanism. Typically, a wire or cord is attached to a device for detecting or reacting to physical movement.

== Military applications ==

Such tripwires may be attached to one or more mines⁠especially fragmentation or bounding mines⁠in order to increase the area where triggering may occur. Trip wires are frequently used in booby traps⁠where either a tug on the wire, or the release of tension on it, will trigger the explosives.

Soldiers sometimes detect the presence of tripwires by spraying the area with Silly String. It will settle to the ground in areas where there are no wires; where wires are present, the &quot;strings&quot; will rest on the taut wires without triggering the explosive, due to the product&#x27;s light weight. Its use in detecting tripwires was first discovered in 1993 by Sergeant First Class David B. Chandler, Chief Instructor of the United States Army&#x27;s Sapper Leader Course. That year it was introduced to students attending the course, and it was later used in combat for this purpose by U.S. troops in the Iraq War.

Another detection method is the use of green line lasers to illuminate and thus expose trip and command wires. The bright laser beam reflects off the tripwire and can be seen by the user.

== Industrial applications ==

A tripwire may be installed in the vicinity of industrial equipment, such as a conveyor belt to enable workers to stop the equipment quickly. These may also be called emergency stop pull-cords.

<doc id="1185056" wikidata="Q7446280" url="?curid=1185056" title="Segmentation and reassembly">
<text>Segmentation and reassembly (SAR) is the process used to fragment and reassemble variable length packets into fixed length cells so as to allow them to be transported across Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks or other cell based infrastructures. Since ATM&#x27;s payload is only 48 bytes, nearly every packet from any other protocol has to be processed in this way. Thus, it is an essential process for any ATM node. It is usually handled by a dedicated chip, called the SAR.

The process is conceptually simple: an incoming packet from another protocol to be transmitted across the ATM network is chopped up into segments that fit into 48-byte chunks carried as ATM cell payloads. At the far end, these chunks are fitted back together to reconstitute the original packet.

The process is analogous to the fragmentation of IP packets on reaching an interface with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) less than the packet size and the subsequent reassembly of the original packet once the fragments have reached the original packet&#x27;s destination.

Since different types of data are encapsulated in different ways, the details of the segmentation process vary according to the type of data being handled. There are several different schemes, referred to as ATM adaptation layers (AALs). The schemes are:
*AAL0 – Raw cells with no special format
*AAL1 – Constant bitrate, circuit emulation (T1, E1, etc.)
*AAL2 – Variable bitrate synchronous traffic, eous traffic, e.g. Frame Relay transport
*AAL5 – Used for most data traffic, such as IP

<doc id="1185073" wikidata="Q7350472" url="?curid=1185073" title="Robert Tressell">
<text>Robert Phillipe Noonan (17 April 1870 – 3 February 1911), born Robert Croker, and best known by the pen name Robert Tressell, was an Irish writer best known for his novel &quot;The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists&quot;.

Tressell spent his early adult working life in South Africa. It was in Johannesburg that he was drawn into labour organisation and socialist politics. In Johannesburg, he was also involved with some of the leading protagonists of Irish nationalism.

He returned to England where he continued to work as a painter and decorator in Hastings and wrote his novel &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;, probably between 1906 and 1910, &#x27;about exploitative employment when the only safety nets are charity, workhouse and grave.&#x27; George Orwell appraised it as a wonderful book.

==Early life==
Noonan was born in 37 Wexford Street, Dublin, Ireland, the illegitimate son of Samuel Croker, a former Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was by the time of the birth a retired Resident Magistrate. He was baptised and raised a Roman Catholic by his mother Mary Noonan. His father, who was not Catholic, had his own family but attempted to provide for Robert until his death in 1875.

By 1875 Noonan was living in London. He was recorded on the 1881 England census, under his step-father Sebastian Zumbühl&#x27;s surname, living at 27 Elmore Street, Islington, London. In the words of his daughter, Kathleen, he had &quot;a very good education&quot; and could speak a variety of languages. It seems he may have had the opportunity of entering Trinity College Dublin. By the time he reached sixteen, he showed signs of a radical political consciousness, and left his family, declaring he &quot;would not live on the family income derived largely from absentee landlordism&quot;. It was around this time that he changed his surname to his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

==Adult life==

===Liverpool===
In 1890, Noonan was a signwriter living in Queen&#x27;s Road, Everton, Liverpool. On 10 June 1890 he appeared at Liverpool County Intermediate Sessions court at Sessions House, Islington, Liverpool after previously having pleaded guilty to housebreaking and larceny on 31 May 1890. On 27 May 1890 he had broken into the dwelling house of his sister&#x27;s employer, Charles Fay junior, shipping agent, Courtney Road, Great Crosby and stolen a quantity of silver and electro-plated articles. He was given a six-month prison sentence. The case was covered by the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; newspaper on 2 and 11 June 1890.

===South Africa===
By 1891, Noonan had moved to Cape Town, the capital of Britain&#x27;s Cape Colony where he was a painter and decorator. When he married Elizabeth Hartel in October 1891, he was recorded as &quot;Robert Phillipe Noonan, Decorator&quot;. A daughter, Kathleen, was born on 17 September 1892.

In about 1894, Noonan moved to Johannesburg, with Kathleen, who lived in a convent boarding school. In Johannesburg, Noonan worked for the painting and decorating firm of Herbert Evans and seems to have had a foreman&#x27;s job. During the 1890s a number of attempts were made to organise amongst British and other immigrant workers. One of them was the Trades and Labour Council (TLC), also known as the Transvaal Federated Building Trade Council. In the late 1890s, the organisation represented &#x27;only the building trades, called together by Mr Noonan of Mssrs Herbert Evans and co&#x27;. It was in Johannesburg that he was drawn into socialist politics. He was elected to the committee of the newly formed International Independent Labour Party. Elected alongside Noonan was James Thompson Bain and it is possible that through Bain, Noonan was introduced to the socialist ideas of Robert Blatchford, and the political writings of William Morris, both thinkers that influenced the writing found in &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;.

It is possible that Noonan acquiesced in a later notorious aspect of the labour movement in Johannesburg at this time: its support for movement towards racially-segregated workplaces, a policy supported by the Transvaal government at the time.

In 1897, Noonan was granted a divorce, following an appearance as the plaintiff in a hearing at the Supreme Court, in Cape Town. The court granted the divorce and awarded Robert custody of Kathleen. It has been suggested that the failure of his marriage may have provided a sub-plot in &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot; that concerns Ruth Easton, who has a child by Alf Slyme.

He became active in the Irish Nationalist circle in the Transvaal. In 1898 Noonan became a member of the executive committee of the Transvaal &#x27;98 Commemoration Committee – established to arrange a celebration of the centenary of the Irish uprising. One of those who helped plan the Johannesburg commemoration was an Irish immigrant called Arthur Griffith, and serving on the committee was an assayer of the mine, John MacBride. The Boer government saw militant Irish Nationalism as a potential ally against the British. Noonan left Johannesburg shortly before the Boer War erupted.

Between 1899 and 1901 Robert and Kathleen lived back in Cape Town, in the suburb of Rondebosch. In September 1901 they left for England.

===England===

Noonan began to work as a painter in Hastings, Sussex, but at much lower wages and in far poorer conditions than he had experienced in South Africa. Kathleen was initially sent to boarding and convent schools, including St. Ethelburga&#x27;s Girls High School, a Roman Catholic convent at Deal, Kent; but in 1904, she transferred to the coeducational and Protestant St Andrew&#x27;s Public Elementary School in Hastings.

Noonan worked for Bruce &amp; Co and Burton &amp; Co., builders and decorators. He engaged in decorative work in churches in the area. He seems not to have joined a trade union. In 1905 he was fined for obstructing the police when a policeman disrupted his nephew Arthur from setting off fireworks, and around this time also he produced drawings illustrating &quot;The Evolution of the Airship&quot;, and offered a model airship of his own design to the War Office, but they rejected it.

In 1906 he became a founder member of the Hastings branch of the Social Democratic Federation. A photograph exists that shows Noonan and his daughter attending an outdoor meeting. He began work on &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;. After a dispute with his employer, he left Burton &amp; Co. He worked for Adams and Jarrett. In 1909 Noonan moved to a flat in London Road, Hastings and the SDP (formerly SDF) campaigned against councillors&#x27; dealings in the local gas and electricity companies. His health began to deteriorate and in August 1910 he travelled to Liverpool to arrange emigration to Canada.

He wrote under the pen name Robert Tressell as he feared the socialist views expressed in the book would have him blacklisted. He chose the surname Tressell as a play on the trestle table, an important part of a painter and decorator&#x27;s kit. (Until the full manuscript was published in 1955, all copies of the book cited the author as Robert &quot;Tressall&quot;.) He completed &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;, (originally called &quot;The Ragged Arsed Philanthropists&quot;) in 1910, but the 1,600-page hand-written manuscript was rejected by the three publishing houses. The rejections severely depressed him, and his daughter had to save the manuscript from being burnt. It was placed for safekeeping in a metal box underneath her bed. 

==Death==

Unhappy with his life in Britain, he decided that he and Kathleen should emigrate to Canada; however, he only reached Liverpool when he was admitted to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, where he died of &#x27;phthisis pulmonalis&#x27; (i.e. pulmonary tuberculosis) on 3 February 1911, aged 40.

Noonan was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave on 10 February 1911 at Liverpool Parochial Cemetery, later known as Walton Park Cemetery. The location of the grave was not rediscovered until 1970. Twelve other people were buried in the same plot. In 1977, local socialists in conjunction with trade unions campaigned for and erected a memorial stone over the plot with the names of all buried there. The plot is no longer used as a cemetery and is now used by Rice Lane City Farm. The site is opposite Walton prison. A nearby road is named Noonan Close.

In 2019, Tressell was commemorated with a march to his graveside led by a brass band.

==Posthumous publication==
Kathleen mentioned her father&#x27;s novel in the presence of a visitor to the house where she worked, writer Jessie Pope, who recommended it to her publisher, Grant Richards. In April 1914, the publisher bought the rights to the book for £25, and it appeared in Britain, Canada and the United States later that year, in the Soviet Union in 1920, and in Germany in 1925. The version as originally published was heavily abridged by Pope, with much of the socialist ideology removed. In retrospect, Richards wrote of the book being &#x27;extraordinarily real&#x27; and &#x27;damnably subversive&#x27;. Pope&#x27;s version ended with the novel&#x27;s hero, Frank Owen, contemplating suicide.

The original manuscript was subsequently located by F. C. Ball and, after he had raised funds to acquire and reassemble the original version, an unabridged edition was published in 1955.

&quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot; has been cited as a factor in the landslide Labour victory in 1945, and even for the election of two non-Labour-endorsed Communist members of Parliament that same year. It has been taught in schools and universities, and adapted for stage, television and radio, and readings have been performed at trade union meetings.

Declan Kiberd has argued that Pádraic Ó Conaire&#x27;s seminal novel in Irish, &quot;Deoraíocht&quot;, has many parallels in its progressive socialism with Tressell&#x27;s &quot;The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists&quot;.

<text>The LG1 is a modern 105 mm towed howitzer designed and produced by GIAT Industries (now Nexter group) of France.

==Design==
The LG1 howitzer is a 105 mm towed artillery piece that features both low weight and a high level of accuracy over long distances. Its lightweight construction gives the barrel a relatively short lifespan. The equivalent full charge (EFC) count is suggested to be approximately 7,500; however, during fire and practice, has yielded only around 1,500 EFCs. The gun was specifically designed for use by rapid deployment forces with attributes such as ruggedness, ease of operation and reduced weight. It can fire all NATO standard 105 mm ammunition up to a range of using HE-ER G3 base bleed rounds.

==Deployment==
The gun has been used by the Belgian Army, Canadian Army, Colombian National Army,Malaysian Army, Indonesian Marine Corps, Singapore Army and the Royal Thai Army.

Current service version with Canadian artillery is the LG1 Mark II, of which 28 were purchased for the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA). GYAT supplied the first howitzers in 1996 and fielding was complete by November 1997.

==Planned improvements==
In August 2005, DEPRO (GVB) Incorporated - a Canadian defence firm, was selected by the Canadian Forces to improve their LG-1 guns with improvements ranging from new &amp; better muzzle brake, new-designed spades for better stability during firing and larger tires to replace the small Pirelli tires (which were found to be inadequate for proper ground clearance while on the move). It is expected that this new set of improvements will give the LG-1 howitzers greater reliability and lifespan, and increase the safety margin for the crew.

==Combat history==
* Internal Conflict in Colombia
* War against Taliban in Afghanistan
* Counter Insurgency in Aceh

==Operators==
===Current operators===
*Belgian Army - 14
*Canadian Army - 28
*Colombian Army - 20 LG1 MkIII ordered in 2008 + 20 ordered in 2012. There were several problems with its buffers and trunnions, along with accuracy issues in its INS Keafott KN-4051 fire control system after a few rounds and constant use/real fire training, therefore the manufacturer included improvements in its buffer system, cradle and trunnions, also the FCS was changed for the Nexter BACARA FCS, tested and approved in 2014.
*Indonesian Marine Corps - 20
*Malaysian Army - 18
*Royal Thai Army - 24 Units
*Royal Thai Marine Corps - 30 Units

* Royal Saudi Land Forces - 88 Ordered in 2017, delivered from 2018

* Senegalese Army - 8 ordered in 2022

===Former operators===
*Singapore Army - 39 (Phased out in 2008, replaced by the 155mm calibre SLWH Pegasus)
* The former &quot;Forces Armées Rwandaises&quot; received some LG1s, after the Rwandan Civil War erupted in 1990.

<text>Ḥabīb ibn Aws [[Tayy|al-Ṭā’ī]] (; ca. 796/807 - 845), better known by his sobriquet Abū Tammām (), was an Arab Muslim poet. He is well known for compiling the Hamasah, which is considered to be one of the greatest anthologies of Arabic literature ever assembled. The Hamasah contained 10 books of poems, with 884 poems in total.

== Biography ==

Abu Tammam was born in Syria near Damascus in a small town called Jasim (in modern-day Syria), north-east of the Sea of Tiberias and close to Daraa. He was the son of a Christian named Thādhūs (Taddeo or Theodosius) who sold wine in Damascus. His early life is not well known. It is believed that Abu Tammam himself converted to Islam, changing his father&#x27;s name to Aus and forged a genealogy linking him to the Arab tribe of T̩ayy. According to al-Najashi, Abu Tammam was a Twelver Shia Muslim as evident by some of his poems. He was also a contemporary of the Imams Ali al-Rida and his son Muhammad al-Jawad, whom he mentioned in some of his poems.

He seems to have spent his youth in Homs, though, according to one story, he was employed during his boyhood selling water at a mosque in Cairo. His first appearance as a poet was in Egypt, but as he failed to make a living there he went to Damascus, and then to Mosul. From there he sought patronage from the Syria-based caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun of the Abbasid Caliphate, but failed to impress him.

He then traveled towards the eastern part of the caliphate, eventually gaining admirers and patrons by praising various officials, such as the governor of Arminiya Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani who reportedly gave him 10,000 dirhams on each occasion and financed his travels. Following the death of al-Ma&#x27;mun, the newly famous Abu Tamman sought an audience with the new caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim who immediately took him under his wing. After 833 he lived mostly in Baghdad, at the court of the caliph. From Baghdad he visited Khorasan, where he enjoyed the favour of Abdullah ibn Tahir. In approximately 845 he was in Ma&#x27;arrat al-Nu&#x27;man, where he met the poet al-Buhturi (c. 820–897). He died in Mosul in 845.

Abu Tammam is best known in literature by his 9th-century compilation of early poems known as the &quot;Hamasah&quot;. The &quot;Hamasah&quot; (, &quot;exhortation&quot;) is one of the greatest anthologies of Arabic literature ever assembled. Abu Tammam gathered these works together when he was snowbound in Hamadan, where he had access to an excellent library belonging to Abu al-Wafa ibn Salama. There are ten books of poems in the &quot;Hamasah&quot;, all classified by subject. Some of them are selections from long poems. This is one of the treasuries of early Arabic poetry, and the poems are of exceptional beauty. A later anthology by the same name was compiled by the poet al-Buhturi, and the term has been used in modern times to mean &quot;heroic epic.&quot;

The famous poet al-Buhturi, who was a student and contemporary of Abu Tammâm, was also a member of the Tay&#x27; tribe. In Arabic literature, these two poets have often been compared with each other. Generally, Abu Tammâm is accepted as the representative of the artificial (masnû&#x27;) poetry style. On the other hand, his student al-Buhturî is generally regarded as the representative of the natural (matbû‘) poetry genre.

Two other collections of a similar nature are ascribed to Abu Tammam. His own poems have been somewhat neglected owing to the success of his compilations, but they enjoyed great repute in his lifetime. His poems reflect a stylistic break from prevailing oral-based concepts of Arab poetry, often describing historical events and people. They were distinguished for the purity of their style, the merit of the verse, and the excellent manner of treating subjects, and have been linked to the prevailing Mutazilite philosophy of the Abbasid period. His poems were published in Cairo in 1875.

According to the poet Adunis, Abu Tammam &quot;started out from a vision of poetry as a sort of creation of the world through language, comparing the relationship between the poet and the word to the relationship between two lovers, and the act of composing poetry to the sexual act.&quot;

<text>Matthew Locke (1730September 7, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War, a wagon driver, and a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1793 and 1799.

==Personal and early Life==
Locke was born to John Locke (1700, England –c.1744, Lancaster, Pennsylvania) and his wife Elizabeth (c.1705, England –1760, Rowan County, North Carolina) in the northern part of the Kingdom of Ireland, from where his family migrated to Pennsylvania, where his father died. His mother and siblings migrated to North Carolina and settled in Anson County, North Carolina (in an area now part of Rowan County). He was married to Mary (née Brandon) Locke (b. 1735) sometime around 1749 in Rowan County. He married a second time to Elizabeth Towers Gostelowe in 1798.

Locke was the brother of Francis Locke, and the uncle of North Carolina Senator Francis Locke, Jr. He was the great-great-great-grandfather of Arkansas Representative Effiegene Locke Wingo.

==Government and military service==
Locke was named treasury commissioner of the Province of North Carolina in 1771. He was elected a member of the Rowan County Committee of Safety on August 8, 1774 and to the committee of secrecy, intelligence, and observation of Rowan County on September 23, 1774. Matthew Locke was a Colonel in the Rowan County Regiment of militia from 1775 to 1783 during the American War of Independence. He was also a Brigadier General (Pro Tempore) over the Salisbury District Brigade of militia in 1779, as well as the paymaster of troops.

== Political career==
Locke was a delegate to the North Carolina Provincial Congress at Hillsborough in 1775 and at Halifax in 1776 when the State Constitution was approved. He served several terms in the legislature, including periods in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1777 to 1781, the North Carolina Senate from 1781 to 1782, and in the House of Commons again from 1783 to 1792. Locke was a delegate to the 1789 state Constitutional Convention Locke was a delegate to the 1789 state Constitutional Convention called to consider ratification of the United States Constitution. Locke voted against ratification.

Affiliated with the United States Democratic-Republican Party, Locke was elected to the 3rd United States Congress in 1792 and served for three consecutive terms (March 4, 1793 - March 3, 1799).

==Later life==
Locke married Philadelphia widow, Elizabeth Towers Gostelowe, in 1798, before being defeated for re-election.

After retiring from Congress, Locke was engaged as a planter and was an extensive landowner; he died in Salisbury, North Carolina on September 7, 1801, aged 71 years. He is buried in the Thyatira Churchyard, near Salisbury.

<doc id="1185101" wikidata="Q7061225" url="?curid=1185101" title="Southall rail crash">
<text>The Southall rail crash occurred on 19 September 1997, on the Great Western Main Line at Southall, West London. An InterCity 125 high speed passenger train (HST) failed to slow down in response to warning signals and collided with a freight train crossing its path, causing seven deaths and 139 injuries.

The passenger train operating company had failed to inform Railtrack and the signaller that the automatic warning system (AWS), which warns drivers of adverse signals, had been turned off in the cab of the HST. As a result, the signaller set a route which would stop the HST and allow the freight train to cross in front of it. If the signaller had known that the AWS in the express was not working, he would have been prevented by the operating rules from setting a conflicting route. The HST driver did not apply the brakes until it was too late because he was packing his bag and did not see the cautionary signals. He was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence, but the charges were later dropped.

Great Western Trains, whose managing director survived the crash in one of the most badly affected carriages, was fined for failure to ensure that the HST had their automatic warning system working during long journeys.

==Accident==
The collision occurred as the 10:32 Great Western Trains (GWT) InterCity 125 HST returned from Swansea toward London Paddington. The train was formed of Class 43 power car 43173, eight Mark 3 carriages, and power car 43163. The driver at the time of the collision, Larry Harrison, boarded the train at Cardiff. 

Earlier that day, the HST&#x27;s previous driver, James Tunnock, had found a fault with the Automatic Warning System (AWS) that prevented the brakes from releasing. In response, he isolated (disabled) the AWS at 06:00 but did not report the failure to the signaller and to Railtrack as was required to enable extra signalling precautions. A fault with the AWS in the London-end power car had also been reported on the previous day, but testing at the Old Oak Common maintenance depot overnight failed to reveal any fault, and the train was passed for service.

As the HST approached Southall East Junction, the driver failed to heed two warning signals (a double yellow followed by a single yellow) without slowing the train down, and only reacted by applying the emergency brake when the red danger signal came into view. As the tracks on the Up Main Line straightened ahead of the HST, the driver saw the Hanson-operated Class 59 locomotive 59101 &quot;Village of Whatley&quot; a mile in the distance, moving &quot;at a funny angle,&quot; and realised that it was crossing his path. The freight train, which was formed of 20 empty bogie hopper wagons, was coming from London on the Down Relief line toward the north side, and had been signalled to cross the main lines at Southall East Junction on its way into Southall Yard on the south side. The driver of the freight train, Alan Bricker, observed the approaching HST and expected it to stop, but was alarmed by its speed and apparent brake application. He tried to accelerate his train out of its path of the HST, but to no avail. A collision was now inevitable. The HST was travelling at when the driver saw the danger signal, so even though he applied the emergency brake, the collision occurred at more than .

The later accident inquiry report found that:
#At 13:20, the front power car of the HST collided with a 22-tonne (22-ton) hopper car.
#Two seconds later, coach H collided with a hopper. The HST power car severed the brake pipes of the freight train, causing the stranded rear hopper wagons to stop immediately. A coupling from one of the hoppers was then severed by the derailed and damaged front power car as it passed by, causing debris to land on the track.
#Four seconds into the accident, with the HST still travelling at , coach H collided with the severed coupling from the freight train, and began to topple away from the freight train onto its left side. It slid on its side for a further four seconds. Two people died in this carriage, falling from the destroyed coach windows and then crushed under the sliding coach H.
#Eight seconds into the accident, with both the forward HST power car and coach H clear forward of the scene, coach G—the second coach in the HST formation—hit the now stationary rear of the freight train. The freight wagons were driven back and jackknifed.
#Both coach G and the struck hopper wagon lifted into the air. The hopper wagon was restrained in its movement, and collided and jammed up against the nearby overhead line stanchions. The front of coach G was flattened as it slid under the hopper.
#Ten seconds into the accident, the rear of the HST, led by coach F, collided with the now stationary coach G. The energy release of the still moving rear of the HST bent the structure of coach G into a distinct half-curve at its midpoint. Five people died in coach G, which was almost completely destroyed.
#The rear of the HST, led by coach F, collided with the stationary rear of the freight train. Coach F was left derailed.

Seven passengers died; six at the scene and one in hospital.

The HST driver said he was aware of the isolated AWS but admitted to a lack of focus, referring to putting items in his bag before the incident twice in his tape-recorded conversation with signallers at the nearest trackside telephone:

If the AWS or the ATP equipment on the HST had been working, the chance of the accident occurring would have been highly unlikely. Functioning AWS would have given the HST driver an audible warning that he was running towards a signal at danger and needed to start braking. Failure to press the AWS cancelling button to acknowledge the warning would have caused the emergency brake to apply. The train was also fitted with fully operational Automatic Train Protection (ATP) equipment, both at trackside and in the London-end power car, but it was not switched on because neither drivers Harrison nor Tunnock were then qualified to drive with ATP. From 1996, high speed trains were driven by one driver only, following the removal of a requirement for a second driver.

==Aftermath==
Following this accident and the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, First Great Western (as GWT had become) required all its trains to have ATP switched on. If the equipment is faulty, the train is taken out of service. It emerged after the incident that the reset switch of the warning system had contamination on its electrical contact surfaces which rendered its performance intermittent, hence its disabling at Oxford the day before the crash.

The HST driver and operator were charged with manslaughter, but the charges were later dropped. GWT was fined £1.5 million for not having a system to ensure HSTs were not operated for long journeys with AWS inoperative.
The action of the signaller in stopping a high-speed passenger train to allow a slow freight train to cross in front of it has been criticised. However, this is standard procedure when regulating trains to minimise overall delay; there was no reason for the signaller to expect that the HST driver would not stop at the red signal protecting the crossover. At the time there was no requirement for the signaller to have been informed that the HST was in service with its AWS isolated. The Rail Safety and Standards Board rulebook was revised to cover this:

&quot;Driver...if you become aware that the AWS has become defective when it is required to be in operation, you must...tell the signaller&quot;

A public inquiry into the incident was formally opened on 24 February 1998, with Professor John Uff appointed to chair by the Health and Safety Commission with the consent of the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions. The report was published on 24 February 2000 with 93 recommendations to improve rail safety.

The key point identified in the report was that drivers had become increasingly reliant on AWS with single-manning and high speeds, and that it was no longer acceptable to run trains at full speed if the equipment was inoperative. The rulebook was changed, so that if AWS is isolated the train may only run at high speed with a competent person accompanying the driver in the cab. This person must have full knowledge of the route and know how to stop the train:

&quot;If a competent person is provided...proceed at normal permissible speed to the location where the train can be dealt with. During poor visibility, the train speed must not exceed 40 mph (65 km/h)&quot;
or
&quot;If a competent person is not provided...proceed at a speed not exceeding 40 mph (65 km/h), or any lower permissible speed that may apply, to the location where a competent person is available or to the location where the train can be dealt with&quot;

Among survivors in the two most severely stricken coaches in front of the buffet car were Richard George, then managing director of GWT, who played a valuable role in establishing calm, and four injured members of staff in the buffet car, who quickly organised help for passengers. 

After the completion of the inquiry, power car 43173, which had sustained heavy damage in the collision, was scrapped at a remote site, MoD Shoeburyness. As of 2021, power car 43163, which sustained minor damage in the accident, is in service with Abellio ScotRail, having been transferred to the fleet in 2018 among other HSTs.

In 2003, a memorial plaque was unveiled at .

<text>The Northern Limestone Alps (), also called the Northern Calcareous Alps, are the ranges of the Eastern Alps north of the Central Eastern Alps located in Austria and the adjacent Bavarian lands of southeastern Germany. The distinction from the latter group, where the higher peaks are located, is based on differences in geological composition.
==Geography==
If viewed on a west–east axis, the Northern Limestone Alps extend from the Rhine valley and the Bregenz Forest in Vorarlberg, Austria in the west extending along the border between the German federal-state of Bavaria and Austrian Tyrol, through Salzburg, Upper Austria, Styria and Lower Austria and finally ending at the Wienerwald at the city-limits of Vienna in the east.

The highest peaks in the Northern Limestone Alps are the Parseierspitze () in the Lechtal Alps, and the Hoher Dachstein (). Other notable peaks in this range include the Zugspitze, (), located on the German-Austrian frontier and listed as the highest peak in Germany.

<doc id="1185126" wikidata="Q190348" url="?curid=1185126" title="Central Eastern Alps">
<text>The Central Eastern Alps (), also referred to as Austrian Central Alps () or just Central Alps, comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia. South of them is the Southern Limestone Alps.

The term &quot;Central Alps&quot; is very common in the Geography of Austria as one of the seven major landscape regions of the country. &quot;Central Eastern Alps&quot; is usually used in connection with the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps (&quot;Alpenvereinseinteilung&quot;, AVE). The Central Alps form the eastern part of the Alpine divide, its central chain of mountains, as well as those ranges that extend or accompany it to the north and south.

The highest mountain in the Austrian Central Alps is Grossglockner at .

== Location ==
The Central Alps have the highest peaks of the Eastern Alps, and are located between the Northern Limestone Alps and the Southern Limestone Alps, from which they differ in geological composition.

The term &quot;Central Eastern Alps&quot; may also be used more broadly to refer to a larger area of the Eastern Alps, mainly located in Austria, extending from the foot of the Bergamasque Alps at Lake Como and the Bernina Range in the Graubünden canton of eastern Switzerland along the Liechtenstein shore of the Rhine in the west as far as to the lower promontories east of the river Mur including the Hochwechsel in Austrian Styria. The valleys of the rivers Inn, Salzach and Enns mark their northern boundary, the Drau river (roughly corresponding to the Periadriatic Seam) their southern border. In the proposed SOIUSA system, the &quot;Central-eastern Alps&quot; include the Rhaetian Alps, of which the Bernina Range includes the 4,049-meter Piz Bernina in Switzerland, the easternmost 4,000-meter peak of the Alps. In the AVE system, however, the full list of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps includes the Bernina and neighboring ranges within the Western Limestone Alps, not the Central Eastern Alps as the Alpine Club defines them.

== Central Alps as a major landscape region in Austria ==
In Austria, the Eastern Alps are divided into the Northern Alps, the Greywacke zone, the Central Alps and the Southern Alps. The latter lie partly in South Carinthia, but mainly in Northeast Italy.

The Central and Northern Alps are separated by the Northern Longitudinal Trough (&quot;nördliche Längstalfurche&quot;), the line Klostertal–Arlberg–Inn Valley–Salzach Valley as far as Lake Zell–Wagrain Heights–Upper Enns Valley–Schober Pass–Mürz Valley Alps–Semmering–southern Vienna Basin. The Central Alps and Southern Alps are separated from one another by the Southern Longitudinal Valley (&quot;südlichen Längstalzug&quot;) Puster Valley (Rienz Valle–Toblach Field–upper Drava (&quot;Drau&quot;) Valley)–Drava Valley–Klagenfurt Basin–Meža (&quot;Mieß&quot;), or the Periadriatic Seam, which is not entirely identical with the Southern Longitudinal Trough.

== Geomorphology ==
The range has the highest summits in the Eastern Alps and is the most glaciated. In the transition zone between the East and West Alps, its peaks clearly dominate the region to the west (Piz d&#x27;Err, Piz Roseg). On the perimeter, however, there are also less high, often less rugged mountain chains, like the Gurktal Alps and the eastern foothills.

The Eastern Alps is separated from the Western Alps by a line from Lake Constance to Lake Como along the Alpine Rhine valley and via the Splügen Pass.

== Geology ==

The Central Alps consist mainly of the gneiss and slate rocks of the various Austroalpine nappes (Lower and Upper Austroalpine), with the exception of the Hohe Tauern and Engadine windows, where they are composed mostly of Jurassic rock and limestones and, locally, (Bergell and Rieserferner) also of granite. The Austroalpine nappes are thrusted over the Penninic nappe stack. Massifs of autochthonous, crystalline rock, which hardly moved at all during Alpine folding, do not occur in the Central Alps – unlike the case in the Western Alps. The aforementioned granite intruded near the fracture zone of the Periadriatic Seam. The Western Alps do not have this division into the Northern Limestone Alps, Central Alps and Southern Limestone Alps.

The Austroalpine submerges itself at the eastern edge of the Alps under the Tertiary sediments of the Alpine Foreland in the east and the Pannonian Basin. This fracture zone exhibits active volcanism (e.g. in the Styrian thermal region).
== Alpine Club classification ==

The Central Eastern Alps also comprise the following ranges of the West Eastern Alps according to AVE classification, which geologically belong to the Southern Alps and are also subsumed under the Western Limestone Alps division.:

The Ortler Alps as well as the Sobretta-Gavia Group are also sometimes classified with the Central Alps, because they lie north of the geological fault of the Periadriatic Seam; in a general regional geographic sense, however, they are seen as part of the Southern Limestone Alps, because they are found south of the longitudinal trough Veltlin (Adda)–Vintschgau (Etsch). Also in terms of rock, the Ortler main crest is part of the Southern Limestone Alps.

<doc id="1185139" wikidata="Q4340379" url="?curid=1185139" title="Resolved sideband cooling">
<text>Resolved sideband cooling is a laser cooling technique allowing cooling of tightly bound atoms and ions beyond the Doppler cooling limit, potentially to their motional ground state. Aside from the curiosity of having a particle at zero point energy, such preparation of a particle in a definite state with high probability (initialization) is an essential part of state manipulation experiments in quantum optics and quantum computing.

== Historical notes ==

As of the writing of this article, the scheme behind what we refer to as &quot;resolved sideband cooling&quot; today is attributed to D. J. Wineland and H. Dehmelt, in their article &quot;Proposed formula_1 laser fluorescence spectroscopy on mono-ion oscillator III (sideband cooling)&quot;. The clarification is important, as at the time of the latter article, the term also designated what we call today Doppler cooling, which was experimentally realized with atomic ion clouds in 1978 by W. Neuhauser and independently by D. J. Wineland. An experiment that demonstrates resolved sideband cooling unequivocally in its contemporary meaning is that of Diedrich &quot;et al.&quot; Similarly unequivocal realization with non-Rydberg neutral atoms was demonstrated in 1998 by S. E. Hamann &quot;et al.&quot; via Raman cooling.

== Conceptual description ==

Resolved sideband cooling is a laser-cooling technique that can be used to cool strongly trapped atoms to the quantum ground state of their motion. The atoms are usually precooled using the Doppler laser cooling. Subsequently, the resolved sideband cooling is used to cool the atoms beyond the Doppler cooling limit.

A cold trapped atom can be treated to a good approximation as a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator. If the spontaneous decay rate is much smaller than the vibrational frequency of the atom in the trap, the energy levels of the system will be an evenly spaced frequency ladder, with adjacent levels spaced by an energy formula_2. Each level is denoted by a motional quantum number &quot;n&quot;, which describes the amount of motional energy present at that level. These motional quanta can be understood in the same way as for the quantum harmonic oscillator. A ladder of levels will be available for each internal state of the atom. For example, in the figure at right both the ground (&quot;g&quot;) and excited (&quot;e&quot;) states have their own ladder of vibrational levels.

Suppose a two-level atom whose ground state is denoted by &quot;g&quot; and excited state by &quot;e&quot;. Efficient laser cooling occurs when the frequency of the laser beam is tuned to the red sideband i.e.
formula_3
where formula_4 is the internal atomic transition frequency corresponding to at transition between &quot;g&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, and formula_5 is the harmonic-oscillation frequency of the atom. In this case the atom undergoes the transition
formula_6
where formula_7 represents the state of an ion whose internal atomic state is &quot;a&quot;, and the motional state is &quot;m&quot;.

If the recoil energy of the atom is negligible compared with the vibrational quantum energy, subsequent spontaneous emission occurs predominantly at the carrier frequency. This means that the vibrational quantum number remains constant. This transition is
formula_8

The overall effect of one of these cycles is to reduce the vibrational quantum number of the atom by one. To cool to the ground state, this cycle is repeated many times until formula_9 is reached with a high probability.

== Theoretical basis ==

The core process that provides the cooling assumes a two level system that is well localized compared to the wavelength (formula_10) of the transition (Lamb–Dicke regime), such as a trapped and sufficiently cooled ion or atom. Modeling the system as a harmonic oscillator interacting with a classical monochromatic electromagnetic field yields (in the rotating wave approximation) the Hamiltonian
formula_11
with
formula_12
formula_13
and where
: formula_14 is the number operator,
: formula_5 is the frequency spacing of the oscillator,
: formula_16 is the Rabi frequency due to the atom-light interaction,
: formula_17 is the laser detuning from formula_4,
: formula_19 is the laser wave vector.

That is, incidentally, the Jaynes–Cummings Hamiltonian used to describe the phenomenon of an atom coupled to a cavity in cavity QED. The absorption(emission) of photons by the atom is then governed by the off-diagonal elements, with probability of a transition between vibrational states formula_20 proportional to formula_21, and for each formula_14 there is a manifold formula_23 coupled to its neighbors with strength proportional to formula_24. Three such manifolds are shown in the picture.

If the formula_4 transition linewidth formula_26 satisfies formula_27, a sufficiently narrow laser can be tuned to a red sideband, formula_28. For an atom starting at formula_29, the predominantly probable transition will be to formula_30. This process is depicted by arrow &quot;1&quot; in the picture. In the Lamb–Dicke regime, the spontaneously emitted photon (depicted by arrow &quot;2&quot;) will be, on average, at frequency formula_4, and the net effect of such a cycle, on average, will be the removing of formula_32 motional quanta. After some cycles, the average phonon number is formula_33, where formula_34 is the ratio of the intensities of the red to blue formula_32-th sidebands. In practice, this process is normally done on the first motional sideband formula_36 for optimal efficiency. Repeating the processes many times while ensuring that spontaneous emission occurs provides cooling to formula_37. More rigorous mathematical treatment is given in Turchette et al. and Wineland et al. Specific treatment of cooling multiple ions can be found in Morigi et al.

== Experimental implementations ==

For resolved sideband cooling to be effective, the process needs to start at sufficiently low formula_38. To that end, the particle is usually first cooled to the Doppler limit, then some sideband cooling cycles are applied, and finally, a measurement is taken or state manipulation is carried out. A more or less direct application of this scheme was demonstrated by Diedrich et al. with the caveat that the narrow quadrupole transition used for cooling connects the ground state to a long-lived state, and the latter had to be pumped out to achieve optimal cooling efficiency. It is not uncommon, however, that additional steps are needed in the process, due to the atomic structure of the cooled species. Examples of that are the cooling of ions and the Raman sideband cooling of atoms.

=== Example: cooling of ions ===
The energy levels relevant to the cooling scheme for ions are the S1/2, P1/2, P3/2, D3/2, and D5/2, which are additionally split by a static magnetic field to their Zeeman manifolds. Doppler cooling is applied on the dipole S1/2 - P1/2 transition (397 nm), however, there is about 6% probability of spontaneous decay to the long-lived D3/2 state, so that state is simultaneously pumped out (at 866 nm) to improve Doppler cooling. Sideband cooling is performed on the narrow quadrupole transition S1/2 - D5/2 (729 nm), however, the long-lived D5/2 state needs to be pumped out to the short lived P3/2 state (at 854 nm) to recycle the ion to the ground S1/2 state and maintain cooling performance. One possible implementation was carried out by Leibfried et al. and a similar one is detailed by Roos. For each data point in the 729 nm absorption spectrum, a few hundred iterations of the following are executed:
* the ion is Doppler cooled with 397 nm and 866 nm light, with 854 nm light on as well
* the ion is spin polarized to the S1/2(m=-1/2) state by applying a formula_39 397 nm light for the last few moments of the Doppler cooling process
* sideband cooling loops are applied at the first red sideband of the D5/2(m=-5/2) 729 nm transition
* to ensure the population ends up in the S1/2(m=-1/2) state, another formula_39 397 nm pulse is applied
* manipulation is carried out and analysis is carried out by applying 729 nm light at the frequency of interest
* detection is carried out with 397 nm and 866 nm light: discrimination between dark (D) and bright (S) state is based on a pre-determined threshold value of fluorescence counts
Variations of this scheme relaxing the requirements or improving the results are being investigated/used by several ion-trapping groups.

=== Example: Raman sideband cooling of atoms ===

A Raman transition replaces the one-photon transition used in the sideband above by a two-photon process via a virtual level. In the cooling experiment carried out by Hamann et al., trapping is provided by an isotropic optical lattice in a magnetic field, which also provides Raman coupling to the red sideband of the Zeeman manifolds. The process followed in is:
* preparation of cold sample of formula_41 atoms is carried out in optical molasses, in a magneto-optic trap
* atoms are allowed to occupy a 2D, near resonance lattice
* the lattice is changed adiabatically to a far off resonance lattice, which leaves the sample sufficiently well cooled for sideband cooling to be effective (Lamb-Dicke regime)
* a magnetic field is turned on to tune the Raman coupling to the red motional sideband
* relaxation between the hyperfine states is provided by a pump/repump laser pair 
* after some time, pumping is intensified to transfer the population to a specific hyperfine state
* lattice is turned off and time of flight techniques are employed to perform Stern-Gerlach analysis

<doc id="1185141" wikidata="Q7682744" url="?curid=1185141" title="Tang Tang">
<text>Tang Tang is a platform game released in arcades in 2000 by the South Korean arcade game developer Excellent Soft Design (ESD). As one of four space soldiers, one or two players place and remove blocks and collect a certain number of crystals to reveal the teleporter which leads to the next level. There are enemies in the game which can be eliminated by shooting fireballs (Press down and jump button at the same time, the fireball count is labeled &#x27;P&#x27;). There are bosses given for each planet (Referring to the game level&#x27;s sector) which players are given unlimited fireballs and unlimited time to eliminate the boss. The game plays similarly to Solomon&#x27;s Key which is developed by Japanese video game developer Tecmo. A port for the Game Boy Advance was developed by the American company GameVision Corporation, who also released the arcade version in North America. It was released by Take-Two Interactive in North America and Europe. The PCB on the arcade port consists of a Motorola MC68000, a YM3812 OPL2 sound chip and a OKI MSM6295 sound chip.

The plot of the game, shown in attract mode, tells that the earth seems to be peaceful forever. But due to the increasing population, there is a big trouble on the earth, making the characters no longer feasible to live on earth. Thankfully, the four characters decided to find out another planet to live on. The four playable characters consists of Cyki, a warm hearted and brave man (Yellow and blue suit). Nana, a broad-minded and cheerful girl (Red and green suit). Niki, a hot-blooded and tough guy (Blue and yellow suit) and Ruru, a shy and timid girl (Green and orange suit). There are no differences in abilities and in-game characteristics among all four characters stated above.
There is a score ranking system of the game where players can enter their 4-letter names (3-letter names for GBA port) to the recorded high score. However, there&#x27;s a glitch where in the arcade version, once all levels are completed, the score cannot be ranked in regardless of how many points the player received throughout the game.

==Reception==
The GBA version currently has a Metacritic score of 56%, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
Frank Provo of GameSpot on the other hand gave it a negative review of 4.8/10, indicating &quot;poor&quot;. He commented on the game, calling it &quot;an uninspiring puzzle game with an equally lifeless plot&quot;. He said the levels all felt the same and criticized the control scheme.
Andrew Blanchard of EAGB Advance gave the Game Boy Advance version a positive review of 4/5 stars, indicating &quot;Good!&quot; He praised the simple controls, colorful graphics, and fast-paced music.

<text>Little Britain is an area in the town of New Windsor, Orange County, New York, United States, south of and adjacent to Stewart International Airport. The name spread to the surrounding region, which at that time was part of Ulster County.

==History==
The area of Little Britain was part of a patent issued to Andrew Johnston on July 19, 1719 for 2,000 acres. It was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1724 by John Humphrey, who purchased a farm lot of 250 acres. Peter Mullinder purchased a farm in 1729; the following month Robert Burnet of Scotland, by way of Raritan, New Jersey and John Reid also bought land.

Charles Clinton was a native of County Longford, Ireland, who espoused Jacobite sympathies. Having persuaded a number of his friends and relatives to join him, he left Ireland and arrived at Little Britain in 1731. Among those who accompanied him were William Borland, Alexander Denniston, Thomas Dunlap, Robert Frazer, William Hamilton, and George Lille. Clinton became a judge of the court of common pleas.

In 1770, Little Britain was designated a road district for the purpose of maintenance. Little Britain Road was one of the first roads in the town.

In 1737, there being but few children in the settlement, Little Britain had no schoolmaster, but around 1751 the Rev. John Moffat, pastor of Goodwill Church, having succeeded John McNeil, opened &quot;Moffat&#x27;s Academy&quot;, which was located in a house on a farm owned by Robert Shaw, on the road from Little Britain to Washingtonville. By 1814, the Little Britain Meetinghouse school district was established.

The first post office in the town was established at Little Britain on May 29, 1824. Hamilton Morrison was postmaster.

Little Britain was the birthplace of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, his father General James Clinton and his uncle U.S. Vice President George Clinton.

Today it lends its name to Little Britain Elementary School, part of the Washingtonville school district. The Little Britain Grange hall also still stands near the intersection of NY 207 and NY 747.

<doc id="1185168" wikidata="Q787218" url="?curid=1185168" title="Automatic Warning System">
<text>Automatic Warning System (AWS) is a railway safety system invented and predominantly used in the United Kingdom. It provides a train driver with an audible indication of whether the next signal they are approaching is clear or at caution.
Depending on the upcoming signal state, the AWS will either produce a &#x27;horn&#x27; sound (as a warning indication), or a &#x27;bell&#x27; sound (as a clear indication). If the train driver fails to acknowledge a warning indication, an emergency brake application is initiated by the AWS; if the driver correctly acknowledges the warning indication, by pressing an acknowledgement button, then a visual &#x27;sunflower&#x27; is displayed to the driver, as a reminder of the warning.

== Principles of operation ==
AWS is a system based on trains detecting magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are created by permanent magnets and electromagnets installed on the track. The polarity and sequence of magnetic fields detected by a train determine the type of indication given to the train driver.

A magnet, known as an &quot;AWS magnet&quot; is installed on the track center line. The magnetic field of the magnet is set based on the next signal aspect. The train detects the polarity of magnetic field via an AWS receiver, permanently mounted under the train. 

An AWS magnet is made up of 1 permanent magnet, and an optional electromagnet. The permanent magnet is generally uncontrollable, and always produces a constant magnetic field of unchanging polarity. A train running over the permanent magnet will deliver an AWS warning indication to the train driver.

The optional electromagnet can be used to provide the train driver with an AWS clear indication. If the train AWS detects a second magnetic field of a certain polarity after the first permanent magnet, then the AWS displays a clear indication instead of a warning indication. The train detects the electromagnet polarity after the permanent magnet polarity. This is because the optional electromagnet is always installed after the permanent magnet (in the direction of travel). The electromagnet is connected to the green signal aspect, so the driver will only receive an AWS clear indication if the signal is clear (green).

The permanent magnet always produces a south pole. If the electromagnet is energized to produce a north pole, the AWS will give the driver an AWS clear indication.

Multiple unit trains have an AWS receiver at each end. Vehicles that can operate singly (single car DMUs and locomotives) only have one; this could be either at the front or rear depending on the direction the vehicle is traveling in.

The equipment on a train consists of;
* An AWS receiver (a magnetic field detector located under the driving cab of the train)
* An AWS visual indicator (known as the &#x27;sunflower&#x27;)
* An AWS audible indicator (capable of producing two different sounds, clear indication sound = bell, warning indication sound = &#x27;horn&#x27;. On modern rolling stock the electromechanical bell and horn is replaced with an electronically generated &quot;chime&quot; or &quot;buzz&quot;.
* An &quot;AWS Acknowledge button&quot; (used to acknowledge the audible AWS warning indication. If not pressed within 2-3 seconds of an AWS warning indication, emergency brakes are applied) 
* An AWS isolation/fault indicator (a visual indicator advising the driver when the AWS has been isolated or has a fault) 

===AWS practical example===
The polarities in this example are relevant to the UK. The permanent magnet produces a south pole in the UK. Other countries may use permanent magnet that produces a north pole. The key operational principle is that the electromagnet produces the opposite pole of the permanent magnet.

====AWS clear indication example====
A train is driving towards a signal that shows clear (green).
The train runs over the AWS magnet (which is two magnets, first a permanent magnet and then an electromagnet). The electromagnet is energized. The AWS receiver detects a magnetic field in the sequence: South, North. The south pole comes from the permanent magnet, and the north pole comes from the electromagnet. This south then north sequence gives an AWS clear indication to the driver.

====AWS warning indication example====
A train is driving towards a signal that shows caution (yellow).
The train runs over the AWS magnet (which is two magnets, first a permanent magnet and then an electromagnet). The electromagnet is de-energized (i.e. it is not powered). The AWS receiver detects only one magnetic field in the sequence: South. The reason only one magnetic field was detected is because the electromagnet was not energized. This makes the electromagnet invisible to the AWS receiver. This south pole by itself results in an AWS warning indication to the driver.

===AWS at signals===
As the train approaches a signal, it will pass over an AWS magnet. The AWS visual indicator (&#x27;sunflower&#x27;) in the driver&#x27;s cab will change to &quot;all black&quot;. If the signal being approached is displaying a &#x27;clear&#x27; aspect, then AWS will sound a bell tone (modern trains have an electronic sounder that makes a distinctive &#x27;ping&#x27;) and leave the &#x27;sunflower&#x27; black. This AWS clear indication lets the driver know that the next signal is showing &#x27;clear&#x27; and that the AWS system is working.

If the next signal is displaying a restrictive aspect (e.g. caution or stop) the AWS audible indicator will sound a continuous alarm. The driver then has approximately 2 seconds to press and release the AWS acknowledgement button (if the driver keeps the button held down, the AWS will not be cancelled). After pressing the AWS acknowledgement button, the AWS audible indicator is silenced and the AWS visual indicator changes to a pattern of black and yellow spokes. This yellow spoke pattern persists until the train reaches the next AWS magnet and serves as a reminder to the driver of the restrictive signal aspect they passed.

As a fail-safe mechanism, if the driver fails to press the AWS acknowledgement button for a warning indication in sufficient time, the emergency brakes will automatically apply, bringing the train to a stop. After stopping, the driver can now press the AWS acknowledgement button, and the brakes will automatically release after a safety time out period has elapsed.

===AWS for speed warnings===
AWS works in the same way as for signals, except that a fixed magnet is located at the service braking distance before the speed reduction and no electromagnet is provided (or needed). A single fixed magnet will always cause a warning indication to the driver, which the driver must acknowledge to prevent the emergency brake applying. A trackside warning board will also advise the driver of the speed requirement ahead.

=== Limitations ===
This list of limitations is not exhaustive:

* The AWS only has two output states; a clear indication and a warning indication. For warning indications, AWS does not provide any extra information about the reason for the warning. It is therefore reliant on the driver to observe the surroundings and determine the reason for the warning indication.

* AWS warning indications require the AWS acknowledge button to be pressed by the driver. It is possible for a driver on a crowded suburban railway to run all day on caution aspects, acknowledging hundreds of AWS warning indications. Continually acknowledging AWS warning indications can lead to a state where the driver fails to take appropriate action. This has led to a number of fatal accidents.

* It is possible for AWS to develop a wrong-side failure and the driver is given either no indication or a clear indication instead of a warning indication. The handbook notes that &quot;AWS does not relieve the driver of the responsibility of observing and obeying lineside signals and indicators.&quot;

* There is also no special treatment of stop signals. A driver can still pass a stop signal aspect (SPAD) if they acknowledge the AWS warning indication. Other protection systems such as the Train Protection &amp; Warning System (TPWS), can overcome this limitation.

== History ==

=== Early devices ===
Early devices used a mechanical connection between the signal and the locomotive. In 1840, the locomotive engineer Edward Bury experimented with a system whereby a lever at track level, connected to the signal, sounded the locomotive&#x27;s whistle and turned a cab-mounted red lamp. Ten years later, Colonel William Yolland of the Railway Inspectorate was calling for a system that not only alerted the driver but also automatically applied the brakes when signals were passed at danger but no satisfactory method of bringing this about was found.

In 1873, United Kingdom Patent No. 3286 was granted to Charles Davidson and Charles Duffy Williams for a system in which, if a signal were passed at danger, a trackside lever operated the locomotive&#x27;s whistle, applied the brake, shut off steam and alerted the guard. Numerous similar patents followed but they all bore the same disadvantage – that they could not be used at higher speeds for risk of damage to the mechanism – and they came to nothing. In Germany, the Kofler system used arms projecting from signal posts to engage with a pair of levers, one representing &quot;caution&quot; and the other &quot;stop&quot;, mounted on the locomotive cab roof. To address the problem of operation at speed, the sprung mounting for the levers was connected directly to the locomotive&#x27;s axle box to ensure correct alignment. When Berlin&#x27;s S-Bahn was electrified in 1929, a development of this system, with the contact levers moved from the roofs to the sides of the trains, was installed at the same time.

The first useful device was invented by Vincent Raven of the North Eastern Railway in 1895, patent number 23384. Although this provided audible warning only, it did indicate to the driver when points ahead were set for a diverging route. By 1909, the company had installed it on about 100 miles of track. In 1907 Frank Wyatt Prentice patented a radio signalling system using a continuous cable laid between the rails energized by a spark generator to relay &quot;Hertzian Waves&quot; to the locomotive. When the electrical waves were active they caused metal filings in a coherer on the locomotive to clump together and allow a current from a battery to pass. The signal was turned off if the block were not &quot;clear&quot;; no current passed through the coherer and a relay turned a white or green light in the cab to red and applied the brakes. The London &amp; South Western Railway installed the system on its Hampton Court branch line in 1911, but shortly after removed it when the line was electrified.

=== GWR automatic train control ===
The first system to be put into wide use was developed in 1905 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and protected by UK patents 12661 and 25955. Its benefits over previous systems were that it could be used at high speed and that it sounded a confirmation in the cab when a signal was passed at clear.

In the final version of the GWR system, the locomotives were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives&#x27; contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery circuit holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a lineside battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. To ensure that the mechanism had time to act when the locomotive was travelling at high speed, and the external current therefore supplied only for an instant, a &quot;slow releasing relay&quot; both extended the period of operation and supplemented the power from the external supply with current from the locomotive battery. Each distant signal had its own battery, operating at 12.5 V or more; the resistance if the power came directly from the controlling signal box was thought too great (the locomotive equipment required 500 mA). Instead, a 3 V circuit from a switch in the signal box operated a relay in the battery box. When the signal was at &#x27;caution&#x27; or &#x27;danger&#x27;, the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive&#x27;s battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released causing air to be admitted to the vacuum train pipe via a siren which provided an audible warning as well as slowly applying the train brakes. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning (restoring the system to its normal state) and apply the brakes under his own control - if he did not the brake valve solenoid would remain open, causing all vacuum to be lost and the brakes to be fully applied after about 15 seconds. The warning was cancelled by the driver depressing a spring-laden toggle lever on the ATC apparatus in the cab; the key and circuitry was arranged so that it was the lever returning to its normal position after being depressed and not the depressing of the lever that reset the system - this was to prevent the system being overridden by drivers jamming the lever in the downward position or the lever accidentally becoming stuck in such a position. In normal use the locomotive battery was subject to constant drain holding closed the valve in the vacuum train pipe so to keep this to a minimum an automatic cut-off switch was incorporated which disconnected the battery when the locomotive was not in use and the vacuum in the train pipe had dropped away.

It was possible for specially equipped GWR locomotives to operate over shared lines electrified on the third-rail principle (Smithfield Market, Paddington Suburban and Addison Road). At the entrance to the electrified sections a particular, high-profile contact ramp ( instead of the usual ) raised the locomotive&#x27;s contact shoe until it engaged with a ratchet on the frame. A corresponding raised ramp at the end of the electrified section released the ratchet. It was found, however, that the heavy traction current could interfere with the reliable operation of the on-board equipment when traversing these routes and it was for this reason that, in 1949, the otherwise &quot;well proven&quot; GWR system was not selected as the national standard (see below).

Notwithstanding the heavy commitment of maintaining the lineside and locomotive batteries, the GWR installed the equipment on all its main lines. For many years, Western Region (successors to the GWR) locomotives were dual fitted with both GWR ATC and BR AWS system.

=== Strowger–Hudd system ===
By the 1930s, other railway companies, under pressure from the Ministry of Transport, were considering systems of their own. A non-contact method based on magnetic induction was preferred, to eliminate the problems caused by snowfall and day-to-day wear of the contacts which had been discovered in existing systems. The Strowger-Hudd system of Alfred Ernest Hudd (1958) used a pair of magnets, one a permanent magnet and one an electro-magnet, acting in sequence as the train passed over them. Hudd patented his invention and offered it for development to the Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company of Liverpool (a subsidiary of the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company of Chicago, Illinois). It was tested by the Southern Railway, London &amp; North Eastern Railway and the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway but these trials came to nothing.

In 1948 Hudd, now working for the LMS, equipped the London, Tilbury and Southend line, a division of the LMS, with his system. It was successful and British Railways developed the mechanism further by providing a visual indication in the cab of the aspect of the last signal passed. In 1956, the Ministry of Transport evaluated the GWR, LTS and BR systems and selected the one developed by BR as standard for Britain&#x27;s railways. This was in response to the Harrow &amp; Wealdstone accident in 1952.

=== Additional functions ===
AWS was later extended to give warnings for;

* A colour light signal displaying a double yellow (steady or flashing), single yellow or red aspect
* A reduction in permissible speed
* A temporary or emergency speed restriction
* An automatic barrier crossing locally monitored (ABCL), an automatic open crossing locally monitored (AOCL), or an open crossing (OC).
AWS was based on a 1930 system developed by Alfred Ernest Hudd and marketed as the &quot;Strowger-Hudd&quot; system. An earlier contact system, installed on the Great Western Railway since 1906 and known as automatic train control (ATC), was gradually supplanted by AWS within the Western Region of British Railways.

== Network Rail ==

Network Rail (NR) AWS consists of:
* A permanent magnet set centrally between the rails and usually positioned such that it is encountered before the signal to which it relates. The top of the magnet casing is nominally level with the running surface of the rails (to within ).
* An electromagnet between the rails (with opposite polarity to the permanent magnet) positioned after the permanent magnet. Again the top of the casing is nominally level with the running surface of the rails (to within ).
* A cab indicator that can show a black disk or a yellow and black &quot;exploding&quot; disk, known as the &quot;AWS sunflower&quot;
* A control unit that connects the system to the brakes on the train
* A driver&#x27;s AWS acknowledgement button
* An AWS control panel

The system works on a set/reset principle.
When the signal is at &#x27;clear&#x27; or green (&quot;off&quot;), the electromagnet is energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. A short time later, as the train moves forward, the electromagnet resets the system. Once so reset, a bell is sounded (a chime on newer stock) and the indicator is set to all black if it is not already so. No acknowledgement is required from the driver. The system must be reset within one second of being set, otherwise it behaves as for a warning indication.

An additional safeguard is included in the distant-signal control wiring to ensure the AWS &quot;clear&quot; indication is only given when the distant is proved &quot;off&quot; – mechanical semaphore distants have a contact in the electromagnet coil circuit closed only when the arm is raised or lowered by at least 27.5 degrees. Colour-light signals have a current sensing relay in the lamp lighting circuit to prove the signal alight, this is used in combination with the relay controlling the green aspect to energise the AWS electro-magnet. In a Solid State Interlocking the signal module has a &quot;Green-Proved&quot; output from its driver electronics that is used to energise the electromagnet.

When the distant signal is at &#x27;caution&#x27; or yellow (on), the electro-magnet is de-energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. However, since the electromagnet is de-energised, the system is not reset. After the one-second delay within which the system can be reset, a horn warning is given until the driver acknowledges by pressing a plunger. If the driver fails to acknowledge the warning within 2.75 seconds, the brakes are automatically applied. If the driver does acknowledge the warning, the indicator disk changes to yellow and black, to remind the driver that they have acknowledged a warning. The yellow and black indication persists until the next signal and serves as a reminder between signals that the driver is proceeding under caution. The one-second delay before the horn sounds allows the system to operate correctly down to speeds as low as . Below this speed, the caution horn warning will always be given, but it will be automatically cancelled when the electromagnet resets the system if the driver has not already done so. The display will indicate all black once the system resets itself.

The system is fail-safe since, in the event of a loss of power, only the electro-magnet is affected and therefore all trains passing will receive a warning. The system suffers one drawback in that on single track lines, the track equipment will set the AWS system on a train travelling in the opposite direction from that for which the track equipment is intended but not reset it as the electromagnet is encountered before the permanent magnet. To overcome this, a suppressor magnet may be installed in place of an ordinary permanent magnet. When energised, its suppressing coil diverts the magnetic flux from the permanent magnet so that no warning is received on the train. The suppressor magnet is fail-safe since loss of power will cause it to act like an ordinary permanent magnet. A cheaper alternative is the installation of a lineside sign that notifies the driver to cancel and ignore the warning. This sign is a blue square board with a white St Andrew&#x27;s cross on it (or a yellow board with a black cross, if provided in conjunction with a temporary speed restriction).

With mechanical signalling, the AWS system was installed only at distant signals but, with multi-aspect signalling, it is fitted at all main line signals. All signal aspects, except green, cause the horn to sound and the indicator disc to change to yellow on black.

AWS equipment without electromagnets is fitted at locations where a caution signal is invariably required or where a temporary caution is needed (for example, a temporary speed restriction). This is a secondary advantage of the system because temporary AWS equipment need only contain a permanent magnet. No electrical connection or supply is needed. In this case, the warning indication in the cab will persist until the next green signal is encountered.

To verify that the on-train equipment is functioning correctly motive power depot exit lines are fitted with a &#x27;Shed Test Inductor&#x27; that produces a warning indication for vehicles entering service. Due to the low speed used on such lines the size of the track equipment is reduced from that found on the operational network.

&#x27;Standard Strength&#x27; magnets are used everywhere except in DC third rail electrification areas and are painted yellow. The minimum field strength to operate the on-train equipment is 2 milliteslas (measured above the track equipment casing). Typical track equipment produces a field of 5 mT (measured under the same conditions). Shed Test Inductors typically produce a field of 2.5 mT (measured under the same conditions). Where DC third rail electrification is installed &#x27;Extra Strength&#x27; magnets are fitted and are painted green. This is because the current in the third rail produces a magnetic field of its own which would swamp the &#x27;Standard Strength&#x27; magnets.

AWS is provided at most main aspect signals on running lines, though there are some exceptions:
* At through stations where the permitted speed is or less and the layout is complex. Where this occurs, these are called &quot;AWS gap&quot; areas.
* AWS magnets are not provided at semaphore stop signals (which can only display clear or stop).
* Where a line is not fitted with AWS magnets, it is shown in the Sectional Appendix.
=== Expansion of AWS application ===
* From 1971, an AWS permanent magnet was fitted ahead of the warning indicator where the permissible speed of a line dropped by more than a third. This was a recommendation of the inquiry into the derailment at Morpeth on 7 May 1969.
* From 1977, a portable AWS permanent magnet was fitted ahead of the warning board on the approach to temporary speed restrictions (TSRs). This was a recommendation of the inquiry into the derailment at Nuneaton on 6 June 1975, which occurred when the driver missed a TSR warning board due to its lights being extinguished.
* From 1990, AWS permanent magnets were installed immediately ahead of certain &#x27;high risk&#x27; stop signals, as a SPAD mitigation measure. This additional AWS magnet was suppressed when the associated signal showed a &#x27;proceed&#x27; aspect. Since the introduction of the Train Protection &amp; Warning System (TPWS) it is no longer current practice to use AWS for this purpose. SPAD indicators were also used.

== Bi-directional operation ==

Because the permanent magnet is located in the centre of the track, it operates in both directions. The permanent magnet can be suppressed by an electric coil of suitable strength.

Where signals applying to opposing directions of travel on the same line are suitably positioned relative to each other (i.e. facing each other and about 400yds apart), common track equipment may be used, comprising an unsuppressed permanent magnet sandwiched between with both signals&#x27; electro-magnets.

== Other countries ==
The BR AWS system is also used in:
* Northern Ireland Railways
* Hong Kong, MTR East Rail line (only used by intercity through trains; local trains operated by MTR Corporation use TBL as of 2012, enhanced with ATP/ATO - due to be upgraded to CBTC by 2021)
* Queensland, Australia; sometimes enhanced with ATP. At the other extreme Queensland also provides a permanent magnet at the fixed distant signal of unattended crossing loops. This is also sometimes comes with AWS Signs.
* Adelaide, South Australia
* Taiwan Railways Administration EMU100, EMU200 series (used alongside ATS-SN/ATS-P, replaced with ATP in 2006)
* Experimental French system, half mechanical and half electrical (1913)
* Liberia; One of the mining railways in this country had a more advanced AWS system that employed two or three magnets of either polarity and located near the rails to avoid the suppression problem. The system was therefore able to give more aspects than the BR version.

<text>Topper is an archaeological site located along the Savannah River in Allendale County, South Carolina, United States. It is noted as a location of artifacts which some archaeologists believe to indicate human habitation of the New World earlier than the Clovis culture. The latter were previously believed to be the first people in North America.

Artifacts at this site may predate Clovis by 3,000 years or more, but these conclusions are disputed. The primary excavation has gone down to a level that dates to at least 50,000 B.C.E., searching for evidence of cultural artifacts. Until increasing challenges in the first decade of the 21st century to the Clovis theory based on this site and others, it was unusual for archaeologists to dig deeper than the layer of the Clovis culture, as they then believed that no human artifacts would be found older than Clovis. 

==Geography==
The Topper site lies along the eastern side of the Savannah River. The site is somewhat hilly: the lowest section lies along the river at an elevation between and , while the highest is the site&#x27;s eastern edge, which rises above . A chute channel runs through the site to the river. The site measures approximately east-west and slightly more than half of that distance north–south, although the full extent of the archaeological deposits has not yet been determined. The site is a chert quarry. The chert-bearing Flint River Formation is exposed on the slope above the Savannah River, at the northernmost point of the formation. Stone suitable for forming into tools is scarce north and east of Topper, making the site attractive for hunter-gatherers from that area. Part of the site is on a fluvial terrace above the river and below the chert-bearing outcrop. Three major depositional units have been uncovered in excavations on the terrace. The lowest is a sand and sandy clay layer believed to have been laid down by a meandering river prior to 55,000 years ago. Above that is a thick layer of gravel, sand and sandy silty clay, thought to have been deposited by braided streams prior to 15,000 years ago. Starting about 13,000 years an ago a thick layer of silty sand was deposited by wind and surface water flow and soil creep from hillside above the terrace. In the late Pleistocene the Topper site was near the juncture of two ecosystems. To the north was a cool, mesic, deciduous forest. To the south was a warmer evergreen forest.

The Topper site, identified by site code 38AL23, is included in the Allendale Chert Quarries Archeological District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located on land owned by the Clariant company. In 2006, a pavilion was built over the Pleistocene terrace, which protects excavators from sun and rain. The Clariant company, which had also contributed to the funding for the pavilion, built a viewing deck overlooking the excavation site on the terrace. Two areas at the site have yielded Clovis material: on the terrace next to the chute, and an area on the hillside slope above the chert-bearing outcrop. As of 2013, had been excavated down to Clovis bearing material, or deeper.

==Investigations==
The Topper site was excavated in 1985 and 1986 by the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology (SCIAA). Those excavations found artifacts ranging from 15th-century Mississippian culture to presumed Paleoindian provenance. In 1998, the Allendale Paleoindian Expedition, under the direction of Albert Goodyear, was scheduled to work on the Smiths Lake Creek site on the Savannah River. Flooding at that site forced the project to move to the Topper site. The previous excavations had not found any artifacts below the top from the ground surface, with evidence of fluted points (possibly Clovis or Folsom points) at the level. In hopes of finding pre-Clovis artifacts, the 1998 excavation was extended below the level. Chert fragments, some of which were interpreted as artifacts (resulting from human action) and lumps of charcoal were found from below the surface, well below the layer identified as Paleoindian or Clovis. A cluster of about 20 rocks found at the level was interpreted as a possible cultural feature.

Excavations were conducted at Topper each year after 1998, and have concentrated on two areas, an area on the terrace referred to as the &quot;Pleistocene terrace&quot;, and an area on the slope above the terrace, called &quot;Hillside&quot;. In 2006, a pavilion was built over the Pleistocene terrace, which protects excavators from sun and rain.

==Clovis finds==
Two areas at the Topper site, the &quot;Pleistocene terrace&quot; and the &quot;hillside&quot;, have yielded a substantial number of Clovis artifacts from intact buried deposits. As of 2005, only one other Clovis site (Cactus Hill) on the Atlantic Coastal Plain had been excavated.

===Hillside===
The hillside is a sloping sheet of sand overlain by loamy sand covering part of the alluvial terrace. A total of have been excavated on the hillside. One area on the slope of the hill above the terrace was excavated from 2005 through 2008, down to below the modern surface. The soil in the excavated area was not stratified, but Clovis, Archaic, and Woodland artifacts were found in distinct layers, Woodland artifacts in the upper level, Archaic artifacts in the middle, and Clovis artifacts in the lowest excavated level. Analysis of the distribution of artifacts, combined with assessment of patination, evidence of heat treatment, and other aspects of appearance, indicates that there had been minimal disturbance of the stratification of artifacts.

==Clovis culture==
Since the 1930s, the prevailing theory concerning the peopling of the New World is that the first human inhabitants were the Clovis people, who are thought to have appeared approximately 13,500 years ago. Artifacts of the Clovis people are found throughout most of the United States and as far south as Panama in Central America. Since the early 21st century, this standard theory has been challenged based on the discovery and dating of pre-Clovis sites such as Monte Verde in Southern Chile, Cactus Hill in Virginia, and Buttermilk Creek in Texas.

==Pre Clovis dispute==
In 2004, Albert Goodyear of the University of South Carolina announced that carbonized plant remains, found as a dark stain in the light soil at the lowest excavated level at the Topper Site, had been radiocarbon dated to approximately 50,000 years ago, or approximately 37,000 years before the Clovis people. Goodyear, who began excavating the Topper site in the 1980s, believes that lithic objects at that level are rudimentary stone tools (and thus &quot;artifacts&quot;). Other archaeologists dispute this conclusion, suggesting that the objects are natural and not human-made. Some archaeologists also have challenged the radiocarbon dating of the carbonized remains at Topper, arguing that 1) the stain represented the result of a natural fire, and 2) 50,000 years is the theoretical upper limit of effective radiocarbon dating, meaning that the stratum is radiocarbon dead, rather than dating to that time period. Goodyear discovered the objects by digging 4 meters deeper than the Clovis artifacts readily found at the site. Before discovering the oldest lithics, he had discovered other objects which he claimed were tools dating around 16,000 years old, or about 3,000 years before Clovis.

According to Dean Snow, this assertion of 3,000 years is a much more likely and plausible number than the upper limit of radiocarbon dating. Evidence predating Clovis culture by a few thousand years is popularly termed as the &quot;pioneer&quot; stage of Clovis culture. This would be the birth of the culture and the start of the tool set. Researchers agree that the lack of evidence would stem from the lack of materials at hand. New techniques would take time to spread. The pioneer hypothesis allows for tools to predate by centuries rather than millennia.

Waters, et al. state that the proposed artifacts found below the Clovis horizon at the Topper site may be natural rather than man-made. They note that the posited tools remained unchanged over the period from 50,000 years Before Present (B.P.) until 15,000 years B.P., unlike the changing assemblages of tools in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene strata at the site.

<text>Frederick Birks, VC, MM (16 August 1894 – 21 September 1917) was a Welsh-born Australian First World War soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Buckley, Flintshire, Birks served in the Royal Artillery for three years before emigrating to Australia in 1913. After serving as a non-commissioned officer during the landing at Gallipoli and the Battle of the Somme, Birks was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 4 May 1917. On 20 September, during the Battle of Passchendaele, while advancing in Glencorse Wood, Ypres, Birks, alongside a corporal, forced a garrison to surrender and captured sixteen men in another attack. His actions were later recognised with the Victoria Cross. The following day, Birks was killed by a shell while attempting to save some of his men.

==Early life==
Birks was born in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales, on 16 August 1894 to Samuel Birks, a groom, and his wife Mary, née Williams. The family lived at Garden Cottage, Lane End. The youngest of six siblings, Birks was five years old when his father died in a coal-mining accident. He attended the local Anglican school (St. Matthews) in Buckley and was awarded a medal there for 11 years &quot;without ever being absent or late.&quot; He was known to be adventurous, being active in boxing and association football as well as the local Church Lads&#x27; Brigade. Birks left school at fourteen, before entering the workforce as a labourer and steel rollerman in nearby Shotton. During 1910, Birks is thought to have enlisted in the Royal Artillery, staying in the service for three years. On 29 August 1913, Birks migrated to Australia with two friends Emrys Edward Jones and William Gray (both from Buckley). They sailed from London on the SS Otway disembarking in Melbourne. He went on to work in Tasmania where he stayed with a Herbert Jones (a friend of his brother), South Australia and Victoria as a labourer and later, a waiter. In late March 1914, at the age of nineteen he started a relationship with sixteen-year-old Susan Gelven who lived in Largs Bay. Susan kept in contact with Birks throughout his service, although she apparently lost contact with him for some time in mid-1917. He is known to have lived in Norwood, a suburb of Adelaide where he lodged with a Mrs E. Cornelius, and in Hobart.

==First World War==
Birks enlisted into the Australian Imperial Force on 18 August 1914, a few weeks after the war started. He trained at a camp in Broadmedows, and was assigned to the 2nd Field Ambulance of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps. The 2nd Field Ambulance boarded HMAT A18 &quot;Wiltshire&quot; in Melbourne on 19 October 1914 and set sail for Egypt. After stopping in Albany, the unit arrived in Egypt on 10 December.

===Gallipoli campaign===
Birks&#x27; unit was incorporated into the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and was sent into action at the landing at Anzac Cove, providing medical support for the 2nd Infantry Brigade. The 2nd Brigade were also sent to Cape Helles, where they assisted in the attack on Krithia. During the battle, Birks was carrying wounded under heavy shell and rifle fire, in areas where stretchers were unable to reach. His &quot;devotion to duty and good work&quot; earned him his first Military Medal recommendation. On 26 June 1915 Birks was wounded by shrapnel but returned to service the next day, remaining on Gallipoli until 9 September.

===France===
Birks unit was sent to Marseilles, France, as a part of the British Expeditionary Force. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 April 1916 and served as a stretcher bearer during the Battle of the Somme. On 26 July Birks was engaged in duties at Pozières, as the Australian and British forces fought for supremacy of the village. Throughout the day, Birks &quot;continually led his squad of stretcher bearers&quot; through the village and Pozières Wood to the frontline, all the while being &quot;exposed to heavy shell fire&quot;. Commended for his &quot;constant good services&quot;, Birks was recommended for the Military Medal. The announcement of the decoration was promulgated in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 14 November 1916, and he was later presented with his Military Medal by Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood.

Birks was promoted as a temporary wagon orderly corporal on 5 August 1916 and the rank was made substantive five days later. After his unit moved away from the front line, Birks had an opportunity to return to Buckley. There, he visited his old school and gave them a Turkish flag that he had obtained while in Gallipoli. Following his return to France, Birks was hospitalised for five days with pyrexia. He rejoined his unit on 14 February 1917.

===Commissioning===
Birks took classes at the Australian 1st Division school in France, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 6th Battalion on 4 May 1917. He had served with the battalion earlier while a stretcher bearer, and began serving as an infantryman at Passchendaele. Passchendaele was characterised by the mud of the battlefield and has been widely used as an example of attrition warfare; both the Commonwealth and German forces were suffering heavy casualties. When the Fifth Army was failing to make any appreciable headway, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig put General Herbert Plumer in command of the offensive.

===Victoria Cross===
Birks&#x27; battalion were ordered to attack and capture the German line parallel to them with the objective to also blow them up, and the men moved towards their positions from Zillebeke on the night of 18 September, coming under some fire from gas shells. 19 September was incident-free, with the battalion preparing to attack the next day, in what would become known as the Battle of Menin Road. Early in the morning of the 20th, a &quot;light drizzle&quot; fell over the battlefield and at 4 am the Germans sent barrages in front of and behind the battalion&#x27;s position. At 5:40 am, the battalion advanced.

The first resistance was met by Birks and a corporal, taking two machine-gun positions as another group of officers rushed a strong post. They were attacked with bombs, and the corporal was seriously wounded. Birks continued on alone. Reaching the rear of the pillbox, he forced the occupants to surrender. Birks then led an attack a series of dugouts and pillboxes on the edge of Glencorse Wood, and fought against machine gun and bombs. He also assisted in the reorganisation and consolidation of Australian men who had drifted away from their unit.

The next day, 21 September, enemy shelling in response to the movement of Allied artillery had buried some men in Birks&#x27; platoon. Birks attempted to dig out these men, &quot;standing exposed&quot;, but another shell aimed at the C Coy post killed Birks, and four others, before he could save them.

==Legacy==

For his actions at Ypres, Birks was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross, the announcement of which was gazetted on 8 November 1917. His citation read:

Birks&#x27; grave is in the Perth (China Wall) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery near Ypres. A memorial was constructed at his old school in Wales in 1921, funded largely by contributions from local people. When the school was demolished the Memorial was moved to outside St. Matthews Church where it stands now. On Remembrance Sunday the local branch of the British Legion continues to place a wreath of poppies on the Memorial. A portrait of Fred is on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, alongside his Victoria Cross. He is also remembered in the Museum in Ypres, Belgium (Cloth Hall). His service during the war earned him the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.

<doc id="1185228" wikidata="Q3331154" url="?curid=1185228" title="Hendregadredd Manuscript">
<text>The Hendregadredd Manuscript (), is a medieval Welsh manuscript containing an anthology of the poetry of the &quot;Poets of the Princes&quot; (Gogynfeirdd); it was written between 1282 and 1350. 

The manuscript was long part of the library at Hengwrt, assembled by the antiquary Robert Vaughan (d.1667). A catalogue of the library made in the early 1800s failed to find the manuscript, it having likely been taken in 1778 by the Anglican priest and scholar Richard Thomas (1753–80), who is notorious for removing important medieval manuscripts from libraries and not returning them.

The manuscript then disappeared for over a century. It was unexpectedly rediscovered in 1910 in a cupboard in a disused bedroom of the mansion of Hendregadredd near Porthmadog: a note found inside, written by the Archdeacon of Merioneth, Richard Newcombe (1779-1857), stated &quot;I have long been in possession of this Welsh MS. but forget where or how I obtained it&quot;. It is now part of the collection of the National Library of Wales with catalogue number NLW MS 6680B.

The manuscript is the earliest witness of the works of the Gogynfeirdd, the Welsh court poets who were active from the early 12th century until the 14th century. It is especially valuable as the only other major source of their work is the Red Book of Hergest. The Hendregadredd Manuscript was probably written at the Cistercian abbey of Strata Florida in Ceredigion. Work began on this collection of poetry sometime after 1282 - first by one main scribe, perhaps the original architect of the volume - but nearly forty different hands were involved in two further strata of scribal activity, working well into the mid-14th century. About 1330 a number of poems by contemporary poets were added. These include a poem possibly in the hand of Dafydd ap Gwilym himself, the best-known poet of his time, who was closely associated with Strata Florida.

Parts of the Hendregadredd Manuscript were copied in 1617 by the scholar John Davies (Mallwyd). Early copies of sections of the manuscript show that some portions of the original have since been lost.

Kaolin, used for the production of porcelain, has been mined at Hirschau since 1901. Interesting is the Monte Kaolino, a 120 meter high mound made from 32,000,000 tons of quartz sand from excess sand in years of operation. It is now used as a (sand) skiing/camping resort during the summer months. It is also the place where the yearly Sandboarding Championships are held.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Hirschau is member of the so called &quot;Kaolinstädtepartnerschaft&quot;. It connects cities, which are connected to the mineral Kaolin. The partnership was established in November 2004. Aside Hirschau the members of this partnership are the bavarian cities Tirschenreuth und Schnaittenbach, from Saxony Königswartha, Sornzig-Ablaß and the cities Mügeln and Nová Role from Czech Republic and Nowogrodziec from Poland.

<text>Sir Victor Sawdon Pritchett (also known as VSP; 16 December 1900 – 20 March 1997) was a British writer and literary critic.

Pritchett was known particularly for his short stories, collated in a number of volumes. Among his most noteworthy works of short fiction are “The Sailor,” “The Saint,” and “The Camberwell Beauty.”

His non-fiction works include the memoirs &quot;A Cab at the Door&quot; (1968) and &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; (1971), and many collections of essays on literary biography and criticism.

==Biography==
Victor Sawdon Pritchett was born in Suffolk, the first of four children of Walter Sawdon Pritchett and Beatrice Helena (&quot;née&quot; Martin). His father, a London businessman, relocated to Ipswich to establish a newspaper and stationery shop. The business ran into difficulty and his parents were lodging over a toy shop at 41 St Nicholas Street in Ipswich, where Pritchett was born on 16 December 1900. Beatrice had expected a girl, whom she planned to name after Queen Victoria. Pritchett disliked his first name, having been nearly mauled by a dog named Victor in his youth, hence he always preferred being styled by his initials &quot;VSP&quot;, despite formally becoming &quot;Sir Victor Pritchett&quot; after being knighted.
His family moved to Ipswich to be near his mother&#x27;s sister, who had married money and lived in Warrington Road. Within a year Walter was declared bankrupt, the family moved to Woodford, Essex, then to Derby and he began selling women&#x27;s clothing and accessories as a travelling salesman. Pritchett was soon sent with his brother Cyril to live with their paternal grandparents in Sedbergh, where the boys attended their first school. Walter&#x27;s business failures, his casual attitude to credit and his easy deceitfulness obliged the family to move frequently. The family was reunited, but life was always precarious. They tended to live in London suburbs with members of Beatrice&#x27;s family, but returned to Ipswich in 1910 to live for a year near Cauldwell Hall Road, trying to evade Walter&#x27;s creditors. At this time Pritchett attended St John&#x27;s School. Subsequently, the family moved to East Dulwich and he attended Alleyn&#x27;s School, where he first had the urge to be a writer, but when his paternal grandparents came to live with them at age 16, he was forced to leave school to work as a clerk and leather buyer in Bermondsey. At the same time, his father enlisted to work in Hampshire at an aircraft factory to help the war effort. After the Great War Walter turned his hand to aircraft design, about which he knew nothing, and his later ventures included art needlework, property speculation and faith healing.

The leather work lasted from 1916 until 1920 when Pritchett moved to Paris to work as a shop assistant. In 1923 he started writing for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, which sent him to Ireland and Spain. From 1926 he wrote reviews for that paper and for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, later being appointed its literary editor.

Pritchett&#x27;s first book, &quot;Marching Spain&quot; (1928), describes a journey across Spain, and his second book, &quot;Clare Drummer&quot; (1929), is about his experiences in Ireland. While there, he met Evelyn Vigors, whom he later married. 

Pritchett published five novels, but he said he did not enjoy writing them. His reputation was established by a collection of short stories, &quot;The Spanish Virgin and Other Stories&quot; (1932).

Vigors had an affair in the 1930s, and meanwhile Pritchett fell in love with another woman, Dorothy Rudge Roberts. In 1936, he divorced his first wife and married Roberts, with whom he had two children; the marriage survived until Pritchett&#x27;s death in 1997, although they both had other relationships. Their children include the journalist Oliver Pritchett, whose son is the cartoonist Matt Pritchett and daughter is screenwriter Georgia Pritchett.

During the Second World War Pritchett worked for the BBC and the Ministry of Information while continuing to write weekly essays for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. After World War II he wrote extensively and embarked on various positions as a university lecturer in the United States: Princeton (1953), the University of California (1962), Columbia University and Smith College. Fluent in French, German and Spanish, he published acclaimed biographies of Honoré de Balzac (1973), Ivan Turgenev (1977), and Anton Chekhov (1988).

Pritchett was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1975 for &quot;services to literature&quot; and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1993. His other awards included FRSL (1958), CBE (1968), the Heinemann Award (1969), the PEN Award (1974), the W.H. Smith Literary Award (1990) and the Golden PEN Award (1994). He was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and the oldest human rights organisation from 1974 until 1976.

Sir V. S. Pritchett died of a stroke in London on 20 March 1997, aged 96.

==Legacy==
The V. S. Pritchett Memorial Prize was founded by the Royal Society of Literature at the beginning of the new millennium to commemorate the centenary of the birth of &quot;an author widely regarded as the finest English short-story writer of the 20th century, and to preserve a tradition encompassing Pritchett&#x27;s mastery of narrative&quot;. This prize is awarded annually, with up to £2,000 being given for the best unpublished short story of the year.

Perhaps his most prominent literary successor is the contemporary American writer Darin Strauss, who has written widely about Pritchett, and who worked to get Pritchett&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;Mr Beluncle&quot; back into print in America, providing a new introduction.

<text>A friend-to-friend (or F2F) computer network is a type of peer-to-peer network in which users only make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.

Unlike other kinds of private P2P, users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users&#x27; anonymity. Retroshare, WASTE, GNUnet, Freenet and OneSwarm are examples of software that can be used to build F2F networks, though RetroShare is the only one of these configured for friend-to-friend operation by default.

Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two friends, without telling either of them the other&#x27;s name or IP address. These friends can in turn automatically forward the same file (or request) to their own friends, and so on.

Dan Bricklin coined the term &quot;friend-to-friend network&quot; in 2000.

<text> is the Germanic variant of major general, used in a number of Central and Northern European countries.

==Austria==
==Belgium==
==Denmark==

 is the second lowest general officer rank in the Royal Danish Army and Royal Danish Air Force. As a two-star rank it is the equivalent to the rank of counter admiral in the Royal Danish Navy.

The rank is rated OF-7 within NATO. It has the grade of M404 within the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s pay structure. The rank of major general is reserved for the Chief of the army and air force.

===History===
On 25 May 1671, the ranks were codified, by King Christian V, with the publication of the Danish order of precedence. Here generals of the branch were placed below Lieutenant field marshal (), and above the noble rank of Count and the military rank of Lieutenant general.

As part of the Army Reform of 1867, the ranks of Major, Lieutenant colonel were removed and only a single &quot;General&quot; rank was kept. After the 1880 reform, the general officer ranks were reintroduced. Commanding generals of the 1st and 2nd General Command were made Lieutenant generals while everyone else were made Major general.

===Insignia===
The first official uniform was instituted on 29 September 1737. The first few uniform designs have not survived, though they were likely red, highly ornamented coats without collar. The red coat remained until 1768, when Comte de Saint-Germain instituted white uniforms for generals, these were however removed shortly after, in 1769. In 1772, the first real ranks were introduced to the Danish Army; these were gold rings on the cuffs, with three for full generals, two for Lieutenant generals, and one for major generals. This uniform saw a number of changes until 1785, when the cuff ranks were removed.

In 1801, new uniforms were introduced for the whole army. Along with the new uniforms, epaulette ranks were introduced for officers, with generals wearing six-pointed stars on their epaulettes. The general ranks remained largely unchanged from their introduction until 1979, and the adoption of NATO STANAG 2116. The adoption created the new rank of Brigadier general, which would receive the one star, meaning the major general would receive two stars.

==== Rank insignia ====
==Finland==
==Germany==
It is the third-highest general officer rank in the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) and German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;). This rank is also used in the Austrian Armed Forces, but is abbreviated as GenMjr.

Historically, German Army ranks for its generals prior to 1945 were offset by one from those of most other major European armies. Thus, prior to 1945, the &quot;Generalmajor&quot; rank in the German Army was equivalent to the brigadier general rank in other armies, and so forth.

=== &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in modern Germany===
The rank is rated OF-7 in NATO, and is grade B7 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence. It is equivalent to &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; in the German Navy (&quot;Marine&quot;) or to &quot;Generalstabsarzt&quot;, and &quot;Admiralstabsarzt&quot; in the &quot;Zentraler Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr&quot;.

On the shoulder straps (&quot;Heer&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) there are two golden pips (stars) in golden oak leaves.

===&quot;Generalmajor&quot; in East Germany===
&quot;Generalmajor&quot; was in the so-called &quot;armed organs of the GDR&quot; (), represented by Ministry of National Defence, and Ministry for State Security, the lowest general officer rank, comparable to the one-star rank in many NATO-Armed forces (Rangcode OF-6). This was in reference to Soviet military doctrine and in line with other armed forces of the Warsaw Pact.

The equivalent rank of the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; (GDR Navy) was the &quot;Konteradmiral&quot;, often called simply &quot;Herr Admiral&quot; for short.

===&quot;Generalmajor&quot; of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;===
&quot;Generalmajor&quot; was in the German Reich and Nazi Germany the lowest general officer rank, comparable to the one-star rank in many NATO-Armed forces (Rangcode OF-6). It was equivalent to &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, and &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; until 1945.

<doc id="1185287" wikidata="Q657238" url="?curid=1185287" title="Waverly Hills Sanatorium">
<text>The Waverly Hills Sanatorium is a former sanatorium located in the Waverly Hills neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky.

In the early 1900s, Jefferson County was ravaged by an outbreak of tuberculosis – known as the &quot;White Plague&quot; – which prompted the construction of a new hospital. The Sanatorium opened in 1910 as a two-story facility able to accommodate between 40 and 50 tuberculosis patients. The hospital closed in 1961, due to the success of antibiotic drug streptomycin in lowering the needs for such a facility. At some point, plans were made to turn the abandoned hospital into a hotel, but this is no longer the case.

==History==
The land that is known today as &quot;Waverly Hill&quot; was purchased by Major Thomas H. Hays in 1883 as the Hays family home. Since the new home was far away from any existing schools, Mr. Hays decided to open a local school for his daughters to attend. He started a one-room schoolhouse on Pages Lane and hired Lizzie Lee Harris as the teacher. Due to Miss Harris&#x27; fondness for Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels, she named the schoolhouse Waverley School. Major Hays liked the peaceful-sounding name, so he named his property Waverley Hill. The Board of Tuberculosis Hospital kept the name when they bought the land and opened the sanatorium. It is not known exactly when the spelling changed to exclude the second &quot;e&quot; and became Waverly Hills. However, the spelling fluctuated between both spellings many times over the years.

===Original sanatorium===
In the early 1900s, Jefferson County was severely stricken with an outbreak of tuberculosis. There were many tuberculosis cases in Louisville at the time because of all the wetlands along the Ohio River, which were perfect for the tuberculosis bacteria. To try to contain the disease, a two-story wooden sanatorium was opened which consisted of an administrative/main building and two open air pavilions, each housing 20 patients, for the treatment of &quot;early cases&quot;.

On August 31, 1912, all tuberculosis patients from the City Hospital were relocated to temporary quarters in tents on the grounds of Waverly Hills pending the completion of a hospital for advanced cases. In December 1912, a hospital for advanced cases opened for the treatment of another 40 patients. In 1914, a children&#x27;s pavilion added another 50 beds making the known &quot;capacity&quot; around 130 patients. The children&#x27;s pavilion was not only for sick children but also for the children of tuberculosis patients who could not be cared for properly otherwise. This report also mentions that the goal was to add a new building each year to continually grow so there may have even been more beds available than specifically listed.

===Building of a durable facility and later closing of the sanatorium===

Due to constant need for repairs on the wooden structures, need for a more durable structure, as well as need for more beds so that people would not be turned away due to lack of space, construction of a five-story building that could hold more than 400 patients began in March 1924. The new building opened on October 17, 1926, but after the introduction of streptomycin in 1943, the number of tuberculosis cases gradually lowered until there was no longer need for such a large hospital. The remaining patients were sent to Hazelwood Sanatorium in Louisville. Waverly Hills closed in June 1961.

===Woodhaven Medical Services===
The building was reopened in 1962 as Woodhaven Geriatric Center, a nursing home primarily treating aging patients with various stages of dementia and mobility limits, as well as the severely mentally handicapped. However, Woodhaven failed greatly because it was severely understaffed and overcrowded. Woodhaven also had reports over patient neglect and was closed by the state of Kentucky in 1980.

===Prison===
Simpsonville developer J. Clifford Todd bought the hospital in 1983 for $3,005,000. He and architect Milton Thompson wanted to convert it into a minimum-security prison for the state, but the developers dropped the plan after neighbors protested. Todd and Thompson then proposed converting the hospital into apartments, but they counted on Jefferson Fiscal Court to buy around from them for $400,000, giving them the money to start the project.

===Statue===
In March 1996, Robert Alberhasky bought Waverly Hills and the surrounding area. Alberhasky&#x27;s Christ the Redeemer Foundation Inc. made plans to construct the world&#x27;s tallest statue of Jesus on the site, along with an arts and worship center. The statue, which was inspired by the famed Christ the Redeemer statue on Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, would have been designed by local sculptor Ed Hamilton and architect Jasper Ward. The first phase of the development, coming in at a cost of $4 million, would have been a statue of tall and wide, situated on the roof of the sanatorium. The second phase would convert the old sanatorium into a chapel, theater, and a gift shop at a cost of $8 million or more.

The plan to construct this religious icon fell through because donations to the project fell well short of expectations. In a period of a year, only $3,000 was raised towards the project despite efforts to pool money from across the nation. The project was canceled in December 1997.

===Restoration===
After Alberhasky&#x27;s efforts failed, Waverly Hills was sold to Tina and Charlie Mattingly in 2001. The Mattinglys hold tours of Waverly Hills and host a haunted house attraction each Halloween, with proceeds going toward restoration of the property. They&#x27;re also currently restoring all the windows in the decrepit building while restoring the interior of the old sanatorium.

===Sounds of the Underground Music Festival===
Waverly Hills Sanatorium hosted the last show of the touring music festival Sounds of the Underground on August 11, 2007. The show featured prominent acts in the extreme metal and metalcore scene, including Job for a Cowboy, The Acacia Strain, Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Chimaira, GWAR, Cameo, Lamb of God, and The Number Twelve Looks Like You. Similar festivals or concerts will likely not happen again at the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, due to complaints made by local residents.

== Tunnel ==
The sanatorium featured a tunnel built to carry steam and supplies between the heating plant located at the bottom of the hill and the main sanatorium building. The tunnel was equipped with a cable car used to transport items up and down the passageway. According to a number of stories and anecdotes, during a limited time between the 1920s and 1940s the tunnel also served to transport corpses to a waiting ambulance at the bottom of the hill, sparing patients the knowledge that someone had died.

==In popular culture==
* Waverly Hills has been popularized on the television show &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; as being one of the &quot;most haunted&quot; hospitals in the eastern United States.
* Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej from the web-series &quot;Buzzfeed Unsolved&quot; visited the location in season 2 for one of their supernatural episodes. They later revisited it for the series premiere of &quot;Ghost Files&quot;, a similar series hosted on their independent &quot;Watcher&quot; channel.

<doc id="1185291" wikidata="Q5598647" url="?curid=1185291" title="Great American Smokeout">
<text>The Great American Smokeout is an annual intervention event on the third Thursday of November by the American Cancer Society. Approximately 40 million American adults still smoke, and tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the country. The event challenges people to quit on that day, or use the day to make a plan to quit.

==History==

The first Great American Smokeout was held in San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square on November 16, 1977. The event evolved from a series of smaller-scale initiatives. In 1970, in Randolph, Massachusetts, Arthur P. Mullaney suggested people give up cigarettes for a day and donate the money to a local high school. In 1974, a &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke Day&quot; (or &quot;D-Day&quot;) was promoted by Lynn R. Smith of the &quot;Monticello Times&quot; in Monticello, Minnesota. On November 18, 1976, the California Division of the American Cancer Society successfully prompted nearly one million smokers to quit for the day. That California event marked the first Smokeout.

<text>Anthony Clarke Booth (21 April 1846 – 8 December 1899) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Carrington, Nottingham, he was 32 years old, and a sergeant in the 80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers) (later The South Staffordshire Regiment), British Army in the Battle of Intombe during the Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

==Action==
On 12 March 1879 on the Intombe River, South Africa (Zulu War), during an attack by very large numbers of the enemy, Sergeant Booth rallied a few men on the south bank of the river and covered the retreat of 50 soldiers and others for a distance of three miles. Had it not been for the coolness displayed by this NCO not one man would have escaped.

&quot;The London Gazette&quot; has him as a colour sergeant, but on the day of the Battle of Ntombe (or Battle of Intombe) he was actually a sergeant; his promotion coming the following day to replace a colour sergeant killed in the action. The gazetting of his VC was delayed due to the fact that the surviving officer from the action, Lt. Henry Hollingworth Harward, was court-martialled for cowardice. The trial commenced on 20 February 1880 and concluded on 27 February 1880. Harward escaped the charges brought against him for deserting his men but he resigned his commission in May 1880. During the course of the trial, Booth&#x27;s award appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 24 February 1880.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in Whittington, Staffordshire.

Huff (born April 8, 1942, Camden, New Jersey) are an American songwriting and production duo credited for developing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly sound) of the 1970s. In addition to forming their own label, Philadelphia International Records, Gamble and Huff have written and produced 175 gold and platinum records, earning them an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the non-performer category in March 2008.

==History==
===Early years===
Gamble&#x27;s childhood in Philadelphia shaped his adult life: he recorded himself on various arcade recording machines, assisted the morning show DJs on WDAS, operated a record store, and sang with The Romeos. In 1964, before there was &quot;Gamble &amp; Huff&quot; there was &quot;Gamble &amp; Ross&quot;. Gamble was discovered and managed by Jerry Ross when Gamble was only 17 years old and they collaborated for many years. Gamble teamed up with Leon Huff (keyboards) for the first time on a recording for Candy &amp; The Kisses. Ross then signed Gamble to Columbia Records in 1963 as a solo recording artist, releasing &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What You Got Until You Lose It&quot;. Gamble &amp; Ross &amp; Huff collaborated on the hit song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;, originally recorded by Jay &amp; The Techniques, who were a Jerry Ross group, and later covered by Dee Dee Warwick and later by Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes and The Temptations.

In 1967 they produced their first Top 5 hit: &quot;Expressway to Your Heart&quot; by The Soul Survivors. In the spring of 1968, for their own Gamble Records label, they wrote and produced the top 10 hit &quot;Cowboys to Girls&quot; for the Philadelphia group the Intruders. They subsequently worked with Atlantic Records artists Archie Bell &amp; the Drells, Wilson Pickett, Dusty Springfield, and The Sweet Inspirations, as well as with Mercury artists Jerry Butler and Dee Dee Warwick, scoring numerous hits along the way.

===Philadelphia International===
With a solid track record now behind them, Gamble and Huff formed Philadelphia International Records in 1971 as a rival to Berry Gordy and Motown. They originally approached Atlantic Records, which passed on the deal as being too expensive. CBS Records, headed at the time by Clive Davis, backed the venture and distributed Philadelphia International&#x27;s records. Aided and abetted by in-house arrangers Thom Bell, Bobby Martin, and Norman Harris, Philadelphia International released a number of the most popular soul music hits of the 1970s, including &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot; by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, &quot;Back Stabbers&quot;, &quot;For the Love of Money&quot;, and &quot;Love Train&quot; by The O&#x27;Jays, as well as the Grammy-winning &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot; by Billy Paul. According to an interview on BBC Radio 4 on June 28, 2006, Gamble and Huff were inspired to write &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot; after seeing someone they knew who appeared to be involved in an affair, meeting a woman in a cafe frequented by the songwriters. In collaboration with Bell, Gamble and Huff also formed the music publisher Mighty Three Music.

Gamble and Huff&#x27;s Philadelphia soul sound evolved from the simpler arrangements of the late-1960s into a style featuring lush strings, thumping basslines, and sliding hi-hat rhythms—elements that soon became the distinguishing characteristics of a new style of music called disco. By 1975, Philadelphia International and the Philadelphia soul genre it helped define had largely eclipsed Motown and the Motown Sound in popularity, and Gamble and Huff were the premier producers of soul.

Nearly all of the Philadelphia International records featured the work of the label&#x27;s in-house band of studio musicians, MFSB (Mother Father Sister Brother). MFSB cut a number of successful instrumental albums and singles written and produced by the Gamble &amp; Huff team and arranged by Bobby Martin including the 1974 number-one hit &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, now best known as the theme song from the American television show &quot;Soul Train.&quot;

===Political activism===
Throughout the 1970s, Gamble and Huff made music that addressed political and social issues faced by the African American community. Many of their songs articulated the theme of black pride and highlighted the Black Power Movement&#x27;s struggle for power and self-determination. Representative examples include Billy Paul&#x27;s &quot;Am I Black Enough for You?&quot; (1972), the O&#x27;Jays&#x27; &quot;Give the People What They Want&quot; (1975), and the star-studded &quot;Let&#x27;s Clean Up the Ghetto&quot; (1977), the latter of which was the title track from an album that characterized Philadelphia International&#x27;s broader political and social designs. Scholar James B. Stewart wrote of the album and initiative: &quot;The record company&#x27;s ability to mount this type of community empowerment venture, while functioning essentially as a component of CBS&#x27;s black music department, is an interesting contrast to the more traditional style of corporate control of lyrical content ... The title song ... implores listeners to participate in a physical clean up effort &#x27;because the ghetto is our home.&#x27; The titles of several of the other songs on the album convey the album&#x27;s broader thrust including, &#x27;Now Is the Time to Do It,&#x27; &#x27;Year of Decision,&#x27; &#x27;New Day, New World Comin&#x27;,&#x27; and &#x27;Save the Children.&#x27;&quot; The album cover prominently displayed Gamble&#x27;s message: &quot;The only way we can clean up the &quot;physical&quot; ghetto is to first clean up the &quot;mental&quot; ghetto. With the help of almighty God, we will be able to turn this community into a positive system. Our first step is cleanliness, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s the closest thing to godliness.&quot; The album jacket also noted that all profits from the LP would be donated to charity for five years.

Gamble&#x27;s &quot;Clean Up The Ghetto&quot; project, which involves the youth of blighted communities to help clean-up and repair damaged or neglected properties, started in Philadelphia, and has spread to Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago with similar events being held throughout the country. Gamble has also contributed his time and energy to the T. J. Martell Foundation and The AMC Cancer Research Center and Hospital. He has served on the board of directors for the Philadelphia Music Foundation, which honors the artists, songwriters, and producers from Philadelphia. He founded the organization Universal Companies which has opened a restaurant, a bookstore, a mosque, low-income housing, and several charter schools. These buildings, mostly built by locally hired labor, have served as springboards to revitalizing neighborhoods. For example, in 2003 Gamble and Universal Companies partnered with others for a $100 million plan to construct and renovate 400 homes in south Philadelphia.

===Later years===
In 1975, Philadelphia International became involved in a payola-related scandal; Gamble was fined but Huff was not. By the late 1970s, however, the popularity of the Philadelphia soul sound began to decline. Disco had suffered a backlash, R&amp;B was going back toward the ballad, and rock had returned to the American charts. Still, the label had its share of late 1970s success. Among the later hits were &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; by The Jacksons in 1976, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; by McFadden &amp; Whitehead in 1979. One song they wrote, called &quot;My Mood&quot; was adopted in 1980 as the close of WRC&#x27;s Friday Night 6pm newscasts. As of 2018, WRC was still using this music.

In 1982, Philadelphia International&#x27;s biggest star, former Blue Notes singer Teddy Pendergrass, became paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident, and the future of the label came to be in doubt. That year, Philadelphia broke its ties with CBS and made a new deal with EMI. Although the hits had by now dried up, Gamble and Huff continued to write and produce for the label&#x27;s artists.

1990 finally saw Gamble and Huff recognized with a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song, awarded for Simply Red&#x27;s cover of the Blue Notes&#x27; 1972 hit &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me By Now&quot;. Also in 1990, Mighty Three Music was acquired by Warner Chappell Music. In 1999, Gamble and Huff were honored with the Grammy Trustees Award, joining musical luminaries like Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, and Walt Disney. Their career output of over 3,000 songs places them among the most prolific professional songwriters of all time.

Today, Kenneth Gamble continues to write, often with Leon Huff, and Philadelphia International continues. He still lives in South Philadelphia, and remains active in his community. Gamble owns the shuttered Royal Theater and surrounding properties.

On September 19, 2005, Gamble and Huff were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for their outstanding achievements as producers at a ceremony held in New York City.

In 2008, Gamble and Huff were the first recipients of the newly created &quot;Ahmet Ertegün Award&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The award replaces the former &quot;non-performer&quot; inductee category. On May 20, 2009, Gamble &amp; Huff were named BMI Icons at the 57th annual BMI Pop Awards. Together, the duo has collected an astounding 86 BMI Pop and R&amp;B Awards.

In May 2010, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff were each awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. The ceremony was held at Boston University&#x27;s Agganis Arena, where the songwriting duo gave the commencement address.

On March 16, 2012, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; published an obituary for Ruby Gamble, the 96-year-old mother of Gamble, in which he attributes his success to her influence.

In April 2014, Gamble &amp; Huff was presented a tribute by TV One on their award show &quot;The Trumpet Awards&quot; which was the 22nd Annual Awards ceremony. Joe, Carl Thomas, Lyfe Jennings, SWV, and Billy Paul performed songs for the tribute. SWV performed &quot;If Only You Knew&quot;; with their lead singer Coko singing lead on the song. The song is one of Gamble &amp; Huff&#x27;s biggest hits produced.

In 2021, Gamble &amp; Huff wrote a song titled &quot;All in the Family Blues&quot; for Tito Jackson&#x27;s second album &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;.

In 2024, Gamble &amp; Huff were awarded Doctor of Music degrees honoris causa by the University of Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1185308" wikidata="Q840211" url="?curid=1185308" title="Fluorescence microscope">
<text>A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence instead of, or in addition to, scattering, reflection, and attenuation or absorption, to study the properties of organic or inorganic substances. A fluorescence microscope is any microscope that uses fluorescence to generate an image, whether it is a simple set up like an epifluorescence microscope or a more complicated design such as a confocal microscope, which uses optical sectioning to get better resolution of the fluorescence image.

==Principle==
The specimen is illuminated with light of a specific wavelength (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e., of a different color than the absorbed light). The illumination light is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence through the use of a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are a light source (xenon arc lamp or mercury-vapor lamp are common; more advanced forms are high-power LEDs and lasers), the excitation filter, the dichroic mirror (or dichroic beamsplitter), and the emission filter (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic beamsplitter are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen. In this manner, the distribution of a single fluorophore (color) is imaged at a time. Multi-color images of several types of fluorophores must be composed by combining several single-color images.

Most fluorescence microscopes in use are epifluorescence microscopes, where excitation of the fluorophore and detection of the fluorescence are done through the same light path (i.e. through the objective). These microscopes are widely used in biology and are the basis for more advanced microscope designs, such as the confocal microscope and the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF).

===Epifluorescence microscopy===

The majority of fluorescence microscopes, especially those used in the life sciences, are of the epifluorescence design shown in the diagram. Light of the excitation wavelength illuminates the specimen through the objective lens. The fluorescence emitted by the specimen is focused to the detector by the same objective that is used for the excitation which for greater resolution will need objective lens with higher numerical aperture. Since most of the excitation light is transmitted through the specimen, only reflected excitatory light reaches the objective together with the emitted light and the epifluorescence method therefore gives a high signal-to-noise ratio. The dichroic beamsplitter acts as a wavelength specific filter, transmitting fluoresced light through to the eyepiece or detector, but reflecting any remaining excitation light back towards the source.

==Light sources==
Fluorescence microscopy requires intense, near-monochromatic, illumination which some widespread light sources, like halogen lamps cannot provide. Four main types of light source are used, including xenon arc lamps or mercury-vapor lamps with an excitation filter, lasers, supercontinuum sources, and high-power LEDs. Lasers are most widely used for more complex fluorescence microscopy techniques like confocal microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy while xenon lamps, and mercury lamps, and LEDs with a dichroic excitation filter are commonly used for widefield epifluorescence microscopes. By placing two microlens arrays into the illumination path of a widefield epifluorescence microscope, highly uniform illumination with a coefficient of variation of 1-2% can be achieved.

==Sample preparation==


In order for a sample to be suitable for fluorescence microscopy it must be fluorescent. There are several methods of creating a fluorescent sample; the main techniques are labelling with fluorescent stains or, in the case of biological samples, expression of a fluorescent protein. Alternatively the intrinsic fluorescence of a sample (i.e., autofluorescence) can be used. In the life sciences fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool which allows the specific and sensitive staining of a specimen in order to detect the distribution of proteins or other molecules of interest. As a result, there is a diverse range of techniques for fluorescent staining of biological samples.

===Biological fluorescent stains===
Many fluorescent stains have been designed for a range of biological molecules. Some of these are small molecules which are intrinsically fluorescent and bind a biological molecule of interest. Major examples of these are nucleic acid stains such as DAPI and Hoechst (excited by UV wavelength light) and DRAQ5 and DRAQ7 (optimally excited by red light) which all bind the minor groove of DNA, thus labeling the nuclei of cells. Others are drugs, toxins, or peptides which bind specific cellular structures and have been derivatised with a fluorescent reporter. A major example of this class of fluorescent stain is phalloidin, which is used to stain actin fibers in mammalian cells. A new peptide, known as the Collagen Hybridizing Peptide, can also be conjugated with fluorophores and used to stain &quot;denatured&quot; collagen fibers. Staining of the plant cell walls is performed using stains or dyes that bind cellulose or pectin. The quest for fluorescent probes with a high specificity that also allow live imaging of plant cells is ongoing.

There are many fluorescent molecules called fluorophores or fluorochromes such as fluorescein, Alexa Fluors, or DyLight 488, which can be chemically linked to a different molecule which binds the target of interest within the sample.

===Immunofluorescence===

Immunofluorescence is a technique which uses the highly specific binding of an antibody to its antigen in order to label specific proteins or other molecules within the cell. A sample is treated with a primary antibody specific for the molecule of interest. A fluorophore can be directly conjugated to the primary antibody. Alternatively a secondary antibody, conjugated to a fluorophore, which binds specifically to the first antibody can be used. For example, a primary antibody raised in a mouse which recognises tubulin combined with a secondary anti-mouse antibody derivatised with a fluorophore could be used to label microtubules in a cell.

===Fluorescent proteins===

The modern understanding of genetics and the techniques available for modifying DNA allow scientists to genetically modify proteins to also carry a fluorescent protein reporter. In biological samples this allows a scientist to directly make a protein of interest fluorescent. The protein location can then be directly tracked, including in live cells.

==Limitations==
Fluorophores lose their ability to fluoresce as they are illuminated in a process called photobleaching. Photobleaching occurs as the fluorescent molecules accumulate chemical damage from the electrons excited during fluorescence. Photobleaching can severely limit the time over which a sample can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. Several techniques exist to reduce photobleaching such as the use of more robust fluorophores, by minimizing illumination, or by using photoprotective scavenger chemicals.

Fluorescence microscopy with fluorescent reporter proteins has enabled analysis of live cells by fluorescence microscopy, however cells are susceptible to phototoxicity, particularly with short wavelength light. Furthermore, fluorescent molecules have a tendency to generate reactive chemical species when under illumination which enhances the phototoxic effect.

Unlike transmitted and reflected light microscopy techniques, fluorescence microscopy only allows observation of the specific structures which have been labeled for fluorescence. For example, observing a tissue sample prepared with a fluorescent DNA stain by fluorescence microscopy only reveals the organization of the DNA within the cells and reveals nothing else about the cell morphologies.

Computational techniques that propose to estimate the fluorescent signal from non-fluorescent images (such as brightfield) may reduce these concerns. In general, these approaches involve training a deep convolutional neural network on stained cells and then estimating the fluorescence on unstained samples. Thus by decoupling the cells under investigation from the cells used to train the network, imaging can performed quicker and with reduced phototoxicity.

==Sub-diffraction techniques==
The wave nature of light limits the size of the spot to which light can be focused due to the diffraction limit. This limitation was described in the 19th century by Ernst Abbe and &quot;limits an optical microscope&#x27;s resolution to approximately half of the wavelength of the light used.&quot; Fluorescence microscopy is central to many techniques which aim to reach past this limit by specialized optical configurations.

Several improvements in microscopy techniques have been invented in the 20th century and have resulted in increased resolution and contrast to some extent. However they did not overcome the diffraction limit. In 1978 first theoretical ideas have been developed to break this barrier by using a 4Pi microscope as a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope where the light is focused ideally from all sides to a common focus which is used to scan the object by &#x27;point-by-point&#x27; excitation combined with &#x27;point-by-point&#x27; detection.
However, the first experimental demonstration of the 4pi microscope took place in 1994. 4Pi microscopy maximizes the amount of available focusing directions by using two opposing objective lenses or two-photon excitation microscopy using redshifted light and multi-photon excitation.

Integrated correlative microscopy combines a fluorescence microscope with an electron microscope. This allows one to visualize ultrastructure and contextual information with the electron microscope while using the data from the fluorescence microscope as a labelling tool.

The first technique to really achieve a sub-diffraction resolution was STED microscopy, proposed in 1994. This method and all techniques following the RESOLFT concept rely on a strong non-linear interaction between light and fluorescing molecules. The molecules are driven strongly between distinguishable molecular states at each specific location, so that finally light can be emitted at only a small fraction of space, hence an increased resolution.

As well in the 1990s another super resolution microscopy method based on wide field microscopy has been developed. Substantially improved size resolution of cellular nanostructures stained with a fluorescent marker was achieved by development of SPDM localization microscopy and the structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI). Combining the principle of SPDM with SMI resulted in the development of the Vertico SMI microscope. Single molecule detection of normal blinking fluorescent dyes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be achieved by using a further development of SPDM the so-called SPDMphymod technology which makes it possible to detect and count two different fluorescent molecule types at the molecular level (this technology is referred to as two-color localization microscopy or 2CLM).

Alternatively, the advent of photoactivated localization microscopy could achieve similar results by relying on blinking or switching of single molecules, where the fraction of fluorescing molecules is very small at each time. This stochastic response of molecules on the applied light corresponds also to a highly nonlinear interaction, leading to subdiffraction resolution.

<text>Amcor plc is a global packaging company. It develops and produces flexible packaging, rigid containers, specialty cartons, closures and services for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical-device, home and personal-care, and other products.

The company originated in paper milling businesses established in and around Melbourne, Australia, during the 1860s which were consolidated as the Australian Paper Mills Company Pty. Ltd., in 1896.

Amcor is a cross-listed company, being listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as &quot;AMC&quot; and New York Stock Exchange as &quot;AMCR&quot;. , the company employed 41,000 people and generated US$13.6 billion in sales from operations in some 212 locations in over 40 countries.

Reflecting its global status, Amcor is included in several international stock market indices, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (Australia), the MSCI Global Sustainability Index, the Ethibel Excellence Investment Register, and the FTSE4Good Index Series.

==History==
Australian Paper Manufacturers was renamed Amcor Limited in 1986. Previously, the company manufactured pulp paper and paperboard products, along with metal can and flexible packaging.

=== 2000s ===
The printing paper divisions were spun-off into a new company, named Paperlinx, in April 2000. This demerger was intended to enable Amcor to focus on global packaging.

Amcor&#x27;s 45 percent interest in Kimberly-Clark Australia, a tissue and personal-care products company, was divested in June 2002.
In July 2002, Amcor acquired the rigid packaging and closures businesses of Schmalbach-Lubeca, headquartered in Ratingen, Germany. This acquisition, at a cost of around $2.875 billion, made Amcor the largest manufacturer of PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) containers, globally.

In 2007, Amcor sold its European PET business to La Seda, a Spain-based manufacturer.

=== 2010s ===
In February 2008, Amcor announced the construction of a 400,000-tonnes per annum recycled paper mill located at its existing paper mill in Botany, New South Wales. The &#x27;B9&#x27; paper machine, so named as it was the ninth paper machine to operate at the Botany Mill, was commissioned in 2012 and was officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O&#x27;Farrell, on 1 February 2013. The B9 paper machine produced enough paper to fulfill the company&#x27;s Australasian paper requirements, and as a result, Amcor&#x27;s other recycled paper mill in Fairfield, Victoria, closed in late 2012.

In 2010, Amcor completed the acquisition of Alcan&#x27;s food (Europe and Asia) and global pharmaceutical and tobacco businesses from Rio Tinto for US$2.03 billion. In 2011, Amcor acquired Marfred Industries, one of the largest independently owned packaging manufacturers and distributors in the United States. In 2012, Amcor acquired the business assets of Carter &amp; Associates, a major distributor of Amcor glass wine, champagne and spirit bottles in New Zealand. In 2012, Amcor acquired the Aperio Group packaging company, adding further capability in Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. This company also acquired Uniglobe Packaging, a business based in Daman, north of Mumbai, India, in the same year.

In December 2013, Amcor demerged its Australasia and Packaging Distribution (AAPD) business into a separate company called Orora, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The spin-off allowed Amcor to focus on making flexible- and rigid-plastic packaging and tobacco packaging, mostly for overseas markets.

In 2015, Amcor&#x27;s chairman, Graeme Liebelt, advised that Ken MacKenzie would retire as CEO effective 17 April 2015 and would be succeeded by Ron Delia.

In July 2015, Nampak Flexibles, a flexible packaging business in South Africa was acquired by Amcor for US$22 million. In September 2015, the US$30 million acquisition of Souza Cruz&#x27;s internal tobacco packaging operations in Brazil was completed. This acquisition aligned with Amcor&#x27;s objective of growing in Latin America. In October 2015, the US$55 million acquisition of Encon, a privately owned preform manufacturing business in the United States, was completed. In December 2015, the US$45 million acquisition of Deluxe Packages was completed. The business operated one manufacturing plant in Yuba City, California.

In May 2016, Amcor acquired Canadian company Plastics Moulders Limited for US$32 million. The rigid plastics business manufactured containers and closures for the food, home, and personal-care markets in North America from a single plant in Toronto. In June 2016, Amcor acquired Alusa, the largest flexible packaging business in South America for a purchase price of US$435 million. It was the largest flexible packaging manufacturer and supplier in Chile and Peru, and a participant in Colombia and Argentina, with one plant in each of these four countries. In November 2016, the specialty containers business of Sonoco Products Company, a manufacturer of specialty rigid plastic containers, was acquired by Amcor for US$280 million. The former Sonoco business had six production sites in the United States and one in Canada.

In January 2017, Amcor acquired Qite for US$28 million. The North China business produced flexible packaging products to large domestic customers in the dairy and food segments. In May 2017, Amcor acquired Plasticos, a specialty container business, from a leading food producer in Colombia. The acquisition expanded Amcor’s specialty container product offerings in Latin America, including thin-wall injection moulding and in-mould labelling.

In August 2018, Amcor announced the acquisition of Bemis Company, a US-based manufacturer, through the acquisition of US$5.25 billion in shares.
Amcor purchased Marfred Industries in 2018, making it one of the largest independently held package makers and distributors in the United States.

=== 2020s ===
In August 2023, it was announced Amcor had acquired the Gujarat-based flexible packaging company, Phoenix Flexibles, for an undisclosed amount.

In November 2024, Amcor entered into an agreement to acquire US-based Berry Global for A$13 billion in stock.

==Structure==
Amcor has two reporting segments: Flexibles Packaging and Rigid Plastics.

Flexibles Packaging develops and supplies flexible packaging and specialty folding cartons. It has four business units: Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles Americas; Flexibles Asia Pacific; and Specialty Cartons.

Rigid Plastics is one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of rigid plastic packaging. It has four business units: North America Beverages; North America Specialty Containers; Latin America; and Bericap Closures.

==Products==
Amcor develops and produces packaging for use with snacks and confectionery, cheese and yoghurt, fresh produce, beverage and pet food products, and rigid-plastic containers for brands in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and personal and home-care segments.

The company&#x27;s global pharmaceutical packaging addresses requirements for unit doses, safety, patient compliance, anti-counterfeiting and sustainability.

Amcor&#x27;s specialty cartons made from plastic materials are used for a variety of end markets, including pharmaceutical, healthcare, food, spirits and wine, personal and home-care products. Amcor also develops and makes wine and spirit closures.

In February 2018, the company commercialised its Liquiform technology, which uses the packaged product instead of compressed air to simultaneously form and fill plastic containers and eliminates costs associated with traditional blow-molding, as well as handling, transporting, and warehousing empty containers.

== Controversies ==
In 2001, Amcor was fined A$10,000 by EPA Victoria for pollution.

In 2006, a &quot;Four Corners&quot; story, titled &quot;The A Team&quot;, revealed the controversial methods used by Amcor to influence forestry policies.

In 2007, following investigations by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, Amcor and Visy were found to have engaged in price fixing and market sharing in the market for the supply of corrugated fibreboard packaging. In 2007, Amcor was convicted by the Heidelberg Magistrates&#x27; Court for releasing oil to the Yarra River from its Alphington plant and fined $80,000.

In 2021, Amcor was ranked seventh on Michael West&#x27;s &quot;Top 40 Tax Dodgers in Australia&quot;.

<text>Lieutenant William Ewart Boulter VC (14 October 1892 – 1 June 1955) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born and grew up in Wigston Leicestershire, and on leaving school worked in a Co-operative shop. After the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Northamptonshire Regiment, British Army, and travelled to France in late 1915.

Boulter was a 23 years old sergeant in the 6th Battalion, the Northamptonshire Regiment, during the First World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of the Somme for which he was awarded the VC.

Seriously wounded during the attack, he was hospitalised and returned to England. In August 1917 he returned to France as a Second Lieutenant and was promoted lieutenant in December 1918. He was demobilised in August 1919.

During the Second World War Boulter joined the Royal Air Force. He was commissioned as a Pilot Officer in the training branch in April 1941 and, after leading an Air Training Corps Squadron in Wimbledon, he retired due to ill health in July 1944.

He died on 1 June 1955 in Wimbledon, Surrey and was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Abington Park, Northampton, England.

<doc id="1185340" wikidata="Q2619651" url="?curid=1185340" title="Asbestos-ceramic">
<text>Asbestos-ceramic is a type of pottery manufactured with asbestos and clay in Finland, Karelia and more widely in Fennoscandia from around 5000 BC. Some remnants of this style of pottery lasted until as late as 200 AD. These ceramics are able to retain heat longer than other pottery.

Occasionally other kinds of pottery that do not contain any asbestos, but do have good insulating properties, are (mistakenly) called &quot;asbestos-ceramic&quot;. However, some such pottery, called &quot;hair-thermal&quot; pottery, is found with similar shape and decoration, dating from the same period as some of the genuine asbestos-containing ceramics, and is discussed below.

==Origin and distribution==
Around 3600 BC, when &quot;typical comb ware&quot; ceramics were replaced by &quot;late comb ware&quot; ceramics, the practice of mixing asbestos into pottery clay emerged in eastern Finland and the Karelian regions near Lake Ladoga, and also along the Neva River. 

The most probable origin of this style of ware is the shores of Lake Saimaa in Finland. Finds from inland Finland are the oldest, and the Lake Saimaa area is the only location in the region with plentiful, nearby, easily accessible natural deposits of asbestos. In Finland, finds of asbestos-containing ceramics are known from to . In northern Scandinavia, asbestos ware appears apparently from to BC.

Some scholars argue that these pottery traditions were influenced from the Upper Volga and the Oka regions.

Asbestos-ceramic of &quot;Lovozero ware&quot; type is also found in Fennoscandia, on Bolshoy Oleny Island in the Murmansk region of Russia. Furthermore, a later type of asbestos-laden ware was also found here, known in the Russian archaeological literature as ‘&quot;waffe&quot;’ ware. In Norwegian and Finnish literature, the usual term for similar impressions on pottery are ‘&quot;textile&quot;’ or ‘&quot;imitated textile&quot;’.

==Categories of asbestos ceramics==
Asbestos ceramics are usually classified as a sub-type of comb ceramic ware.

From the times of the earliest comb ware () in Finland, asbestos was mixed with clay as an adhesive. At some point, people started to make use of the characteristics of asbestos: Its long fibres allowed large vessels with thin walls, which made them lighter, without compromising durability. Some of the vessels had walls 6 mm thick with a diameter of around 50 cm (Pöljä-style).

The Finnish researchers divide asbestos ceramics into the following styles:

;Early asbestos ware:
*Pit-comb ware with asbestos
*Kaunissaari ware
*Sperrings ware

;Main-period styles:
*Pöljä ware
*Kierikki ware

;Late asbestos ware:
*Jysmä ware

&quot;Kaunissaari ware&quot; () was an early asbestos-tempered ware. Its distribution is centred on the eastern lake area of Finland. &quot;Sperrings ware&quot; was another type of early asbestos-tempered ware from about the same time.

The style seems to disappear around 200 AD in Finland but continues in Scandinavia. The disappearance is thought to be related to the transition to a semi-nomadic reindeer husbandry lifestyle.

===Asbestos-containing variants===
There are two variants of asbestos-containing pottery. The name depends on the proportion of asbestos: Ceramics with an asbestos amount of 50–60% are called &quot;asbestos pottery&quot;; vessels containing 90% asbestos and 10% clay are &quot;asbestos ware&quot;.

;Asbestos pottery
&quot;Asbestos pottery&quot; (50–60% asbestos, 50–40% clay) is usually found along with evidence suggesting metal work, i.e. crucibles, moulds, slag, fused clay, artefacts of bronze and copper, and stone sledge hammers. Asbestos ceramic may also have been used as a heat-storage medium.

Some of the Fenno-Scandinavian vessel patterns are identical to the Neolithic and Bronze Age Jōmon culture in Japan (&quot;jōmon&quot; = rope pattern). However, the most common patterns are the comb and pit decorations typical of North-Eastern Europe at the time (Finland).

;Asbestos ware
&quot;Asbestos ware&quot; (90% asbestos, 10% clay) is unusually heat-tolerant: It can survive temperatures up to 900–1000 °C. The clay is used to make shaping the vessel possible, but with such a low proportion of clay, it is technically not pottery.

It is believed that the asbestos ware was also used in iron production such as spearheads, arrowheads and artefacts. Found vessels were drilled with many holes. The fact that the reduction of iron ore (FeO3) with abundant carbon generates large amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) may suggest that the drilled holes were used to improve the availability of air (oxygen) to maintain an adequately intense flame for the high temperatures required for the iron smelting. Iron ore is abundant in lakes e.g. in Finland.

===Clay with hair added===
Lastly, the term &quot;hair-temperature&quot; pottery refers to ceramics made of fine, sorted clay, augmented with about 30% finely cut hair and chamotte. It generally contains no asbestos (some samples have insignificant traces).
These ceramics were made with similar shape, size, and surface treatment (including decoration) as the asbestos pottery.

Hair, when used as ceramic additive, burns away at the time of firing, leaving characteristic thin pores in the resulting pottery.
The &quot;hair-thermal&quot; ceramics&#x27; intended use is unknown, but tests of its heat-retaining (&quot;insulating&quot;) capacity suggests it was intended for some kind of use requiring insulation. However, unlike asbestos, mixing hair into clay does not improve the durability or heat &quot;resistance&quot; of the resulting ceramic.

<text>Lustnau is a subdivision in the northeastern part of Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was an independent municipality until 1934, when it became a part of Tübingen. Its present population is around 10,000. Its area is 14.32 km2. Lustnau has four kindergartens and a Grundschule.

==History==

The area was an Alemannic settlement. At excavations performed in the 1960s near the church remains from the Roman era have been found. The present village was first mentioned in 1100 as &quot;Lustnow&quot;. Agriculture and viticulture were the main source of income of the village in the Middle Ages. The vineyards were mainly in the localities Herrlesberg, Österberg and Neuhalde. They were replaced by hops cultivation in the second half of the 19th century. In the course of the 20th century the area was more and more urbanized and industrialized. In 1934, the year of its incorporation into the city of Tübingen, Lustnau&#x27;s population was around 3,500.

<doc id="1185354" wikidata="Q1548752" url="?curid=1185354" title="Organizational citizenship behavior">
<text>In industrial and organizational psychology, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is a person&#x27;s voluntary commitment within an organization or company that is not part of his or her contractual tasks. Organizational citizenship behavior has been studied since the late 1970s. Over the past three decades, interest in these behaviors has increased substantially.

Organizational behavior has been linked to overall organizational effectiveness, thus these types of employee behaviors have important consequences in the workplace.

Organ expanded upon Katz&#x27;s (1964) original work.

== Definition of the concept ==
Organ (1988) defines OCB as &quot;individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization&quot;.
Organ&#x27;s definition of OCB includes three critical aspects that are central to this construct:

# First, OCBs are thought of as discretionary behaviors, which are not part of the job description, and are performed by the employee as a result of personal choice.
# Second, OCBs go above and beyond that which is an enforceable requirement of the job description.
# Finally, OCBs contribute positively to overall organizational effectiveness.

At the same time, Organ&#x27;s (1988) definition of OCB has generated a great deal of criticism. The very nature of the construct makes it difficult to operationally define. Critics started questioning whether or not OCBs, as defined by Organ, were discretionary in nature. Organ (1997), in response to criticisms, notes that since his original definition, jobs have moved away from a clearly defined set of tasks and responsibilities and have evolved into much more ambiguous roles. Without a defined role, it quickly becomes difficult to define what is discretionary.

==Similar constructs==
=== Contextual performance ===
OCB has often been compared to contextual performance. Similarly to OCB, this concept emerged in response to the realization that only looking at job specific work behaviors ignored a significant portion of the job domain. Originally, experts in this field focused only on activities that directly supported the output of the organization. As the job market became more aggressive, it became necessary for employees to go above and beyond that which is formally required by the job description in order to remain competitive. Contextual performance is defined as non-task related work behaviors and activities that contribute to the social and psychological aspects of the organization.

Contextual performance consists of four elements: persistence of enthusiasm, assistance to others, rule and proscribed procedure following, and openly defending the organizations objectives. OCB and contextual performance share their defining attributes as they both consist of behaviors other than those needed to perform the routine functions of the job. Both also require that these behaviors contribute to the overall success of the organization. Additionally, they also agree on the theme that these behaviors are discretionary and each employee chooses the amount and degree to which they will perform them. However, while contextual performance and OCB share a good part of their content domain, there are some important differences between the two constructs. One of the main requirements of OCBs is that they are not formally rewarded, which is not the case for contextual performance. Organ (1997) contends that OCBs may at some point encourage some sort of reward, but that these rewards would be indirect and uncertain. Also, contextual performance does not require that the behavior be extra-role, only that it be non-task. The differences between contextual performance and OCB are slight and easy to miss, however, they do exist.

=== Prosocial organizational behavior ===
OCB has also been compared to prosocial organizational behavior (POB). POB is defined as behavior within an organization that is aimed at improving the welfare of an individual, a group or an organization. The important distinction here is that this type of behavior, unlike OCB, can be unrelated to the organization. Thus, someone exhibiting prosocial behavior could be helping a coworker with personal matter.

=== Extra-role behavior ===
Extra-role behavior (ERB), first defined by Van Dyne, Cummings and Mclean-Parks (1995, as cited in Organ, Podsakoff, &amp; MacKenzie, 2006), is another construct similar to OCB. ERB is defined as &quot;behavior that attempts to benefit the organization and that goes beyond existing role expectations&quot; (Organ et al., 2006, p. 33). While similar in many aspects, there do exist some important differences between OCB and ERB. Two concepts are a part of ERB that are not included in OCB: whistle blowing and principled organizational dissent. Whistle blowing involves the reporting of one employee by another so that unethical and or illegal practices are brought to the attention of authorities (Near &amp; Miceli, 1987, as cited in Organ et al., 2006). Principled organizational dissent is when employees protest the organization because of some kind of injustice (Graham, 1986, as cited in Organ et al., 2006). Both of these ideas contribute to ERB in the sense that and that they are not included in the formal job description. This again, is a construct very similar to OCB.

==Altruism and general compliance==
Smith, Organ, and Near (1983) first proposed that OCB is composed of altruism and general compliance. These two dimensions serve to improve organizational effectiveness in different ways. Altruism in the workplace consists essentially of helping behaviors. These behaviors can both be directed within or outside of the organization. There is no direct link, or one-to-one relationship, between every instance of helping behavior and a specific gain for the organization. The idea is that over time, the compilation of employees helping behavior will eventually be advantageous for the organization (Organ et al., 2006).

General compliance behavior serves to benefit the organization in several ways. Low rates of absenteeism and rule following help to keep the organization running efficiently. A compliant employee does not engage in behaviors such as taking excessive breaks or using work time for personal matters. When these types of behaviors are minimized the workforce is naturally more productive.

Later, Organ (1988) deconstructed the dimension of general compliance and added additional dimensions of OCB. This deconstruction resulted in a five-factor model consisting of altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, civic virtue, and sportsmanship. The definition of altruism remained much as it was, defined by discretionary behaviors that have the effect of helping a specific colleague with an organizationally relevant task or problem. Conscientiousness consists of behaviors that go well beyond the minimum role requirements of the organization (Law, Wong, &amp; Chen, 2005). These behaviors indicate that employees accept and adhere to the rules, regulations, and procedures of the organization.

Civic virtue is characterized by behaviors that indicate the employee&#x27;s deep concerns and interest in the life of the organization (Law et al., 2005). This dimension also encompasses positive involvement in the concerns of the organization (Organ et al., 2006). Examples of civic virtue can be seen in daily affairs such as attending meetings and keeping up with what is going on with the organization in general. Civic virtue can also be demonstrated on a larger scale by defending the organization&#x27;s policies and practices when they are challenged by an outside source.

Courtesy has been defined as discretionary behaviors that aim at preventing work-related conflicts with others (Law et al., 2005). This dimension is a form of helping behavior, but one that works to prevent problems from arising. It also includes the word&#x27;s literal definition of being polite and considerate of others (Organ et al., 2006). Examples of courteous behaviors are asking fellow employees if they would like a cup of coffee while you are getting one for yourself, making extra copies of the meeting agenda for your teammates, and giving a colleague ample notice when you alter something that will affect them.

Finally, sportsmanship has been defined as a willingness on the part of the employee that signifies the employee&#x27;s tolerance of less-than-ideal organizational circumstances without complaining and blowing problems out of proportion. Organ et al. (2006) further define sportsmanship as an employee&#x27;s &quot;ability to roll with the punches&quot; even if they do not like or agree with the changes that are occurring within the organization. By reducing the number of complaints from employees that administrators have to deal with, sportsmanship conserves time and energy.

It has been proven empirically that the factors listed above are the most robust and distinct factors in assessing OCB. However, in a meta-analysis of the OCB literature, LePine, Erez, and Johnson (2002) found that these five dimensions are very highly correlated and do not have much differentiation among s, indicating some overlap in the dimensions.

==Behaviors directed at the individual and the organization==
A different way of organizing the OCB construct was proposed by Williams and Anderson (1991). They divided up the dimensions of OCB into two different types of OCB based on whom the behaviors were directed at. Organizational citizenship behavior – individuals (OCBI) include behaviors that are aimed at other individuals in the workplace while organizational citizenship behavior-organizational (OCBO) include behaviors directed at the organization as a whole. Altruism and courtesy are actions aimed at other employees and thus fall under the umbrella of OCBIs. Conscientiousness, civic virtue, and sportsmanship are behaviors intended for the benefit of the organization and can subsequently be considered OCBOs. Those dimensions are widely used in organizational behavior studies e.g.

==Motivations for engaging in Organizational Citizenship Behaviour==
Motivation plays an important role in driving individuals to engage in Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB). The underlying mechanisms that lead employees to engage in these extra-role behaviors are significant for both academic study and practical application in the field of public management.

=== Theories of Motivation ===
Several prominent theories in psychology and organizational behavior provide insights on the motivations behind OCB. One such theory is Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. According to Maslow, individuals have a hierarchy of needs ranging from physiological needs to self-actualization. Once basic needs are met, individuals are motivated by higher-level needs, such as belongingness and esteem. In the context of OCB, employees who feel a sense of belonging and recognition are more likely to engage in discretionary behaviors that benefit the organization.

Another relevant theory is Frederick Herzberg&#x27;s Two-Factor Theory. Herzberg distinguished between hygiene factors, which include extrinsic factors like salary and working conditions, and motivators, which comprise factors such as recognition and achievement. An illustrative example of this theory in action is when an organization provides a conducive work environment (hygiene factor) along with regular employee recognition programs (motivator). This combination can significantly contribute to a motivated workforce, more inclined towards engaging in OCB.

=== Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation ===
Motivation can be categorized into two primary types: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations play distinct roles in encouraging OCB. Intrinsic motivation stems from internal factors within an individual. It is characterized by a sense of personal satisfaction, enjoyment, or fulfillment derived from engaging with or performing an activity or task. Employees who are intrinsically motivated to excel in their roles are more likely to engage in OCB, as they find satisfaction in contributing beyond their basic job requirements. For instance, an employee might mentor a new team member not because of a specific reward, but because they find fulfillment in helping others grow professionally.

On the other hand, extrinsic motivation comes from external stimuli, typically in the form of rewards or punishments. Examples of extrinsic motivators include performance bonuses, incentives, recognition, promotions, or advancement opportunities.

In summary, while both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can influence behavior, the former is often more closely associated with sustained engagement in OCB.

=== Public Sector and OCB ===
The public sector presents a unique context for considering OCB and its motivations. Research has shown that public sector employees often exhibit higher levels of OCB compared to their private sector counterparts. This can be attributed, in part, to the intrinsic motivation derived from the public service aspect of their roles. Public sector workers often have a strong sense of duty and commitment to the greater good, which can serve as a powerful motivator for engaging in behaviors that benefit the organization and the broader community.

Additionally, public sector organizations often have specific mission statements and values centered around public service, which can enhance employees&#x27; intrinsic motivation to engage in OCB. Research has highlighted the importance of organizational mission in fostering OCB in the public sector.

=== The Influence of Organizational Culture ===
Organizational culture plays a pivotal role in shaping the motivation for OCB. A culture that values teamwork, collaboration, and mutual respect fosters an environment where employees are more inclined to engage in discretionary efforts. Research indicates that when individuals perceive their organization as supportive, fair, and appreciative of their contributions, they are more likely to exhibit OCB. Additionally, organizations that celebrate and recognize OCB reinforce the intrinsic motivation among employees, further encouraging them to go above and beyond their formal job roles for the collective benefit of the organization.

=== The Role of Transformational Leadership ===
Transformational leadership has been identified as a significant predictor of employees engaging in OCB. This leadership style involves inspiring and motivating employees by creating a compelling vision of the future and empowering them to contribute meaningfully to organizational goals. Studies have shown that leaders who exhibit transformational qualities, such as charisma, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and inspirational motivation, are more likely to foster a culture of OCB within their teams. By providing a supportive and empowering environment, transformational leaders can enhance employees&#x27; intrinsic motivation, leading to increased discretionary efforts and OCB.

=== Summary ===
Motivation plays a central role in OCB. Intrinsic factors, driven by purpose and fulfillment, are key in sustaining discretionary efforts. In the public sector, this commitment to the greater good is particularly pronounced. Fostering motivation, as well as a culture of collaboration and empowerment, assists to promote a culture of organizational citizenship.

==Gender differences==
Research on gender-role stereotypes has gone on for decades. It is widely accepted that certain behaviors are considered more feminine and certain behaviors are considered more masculine. Feminine behaviors have been characterized as interpersonal in orientation and focused on a concern for others. Masculine behaviors, on the other hand, are typically more aggressive and independent (Spence &amp; Helmreich, 1980). In line with these ideas, the OCB dimensions of altruism, courtesy, civic virtue and sportsmanship can be divided by gender role. Altruism and courtesy, previously mentioned as OCBIs, are considered in-role behavior for women, while civic virtue and sportsmanship, previously mentioned as OCBOs, are regarded as more in-role for men. The dimension of conscientiousness, which includes attention to detail and adherence to organizational rules, is excluded, as this dimension does not seem to adhere to any particular gender norm (Kidder &amp; Parks, 2001).

==Counterproductive work behavior==
Counterproductive work behavior (CWB) is defined as &quot;intentional employee behavior that is harmful to the legitimate interests of an organization&quot; (Dalal, 2005). When considering the definitions of OCB and CWB, it seems logical to assume that these constructs are opposites; one harms the organization and the other helps. Individuals might further assume that by engaging in one of these types of behaviors, an individual will not tend to engage in the other. However, a recent meta-analysis, Dalal (2005), found that this is not the case. The results of this analysis indicate that these constructs only shared a little to moderate negative correlation and furthermore showed differences in magnitude and pattern of relationships between various antecedents and the two constructs. These results indicate that CWB and OCB are two separate constructs and should be conceptualized as thus.

==Antecedents==
Early research regarding the s of OCB focused on employee attitudes, dispositions, and leader supportiveness. More recently, many different variables have been examined in the effort to determine the antecedents of OCB. Commonly studied antecedents of OCB are job satisfaction, perceptions of organizational justice, organizational commitment, personality characteristics, task characteristics, and leadership behavior. These antecedents have been analyzed at both the overall and individual OCB levels.

One of the most intuitive antecedents of OCB is job satisfaction. Organ and Ryan (1995) conducted a meta-analysis of 28 studies and found a modest relationship between job satisfaction and OCB. This relationship was stronger than the relationship between job satisfaction and in-role performance. Other attitudinal measures, perceived fairness, organizational commitment, and leader supportiveness are found to correlate with OCB at about the same rate as satisfaction (Organ &amp; Ryan, 1995).

In terms of personality characteristics, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and positive and negative affectivity garner the most support as antecedents of OCB (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, &amp; Bachrach, 2000). Conscientiousness, in particular, has been found to have a strong relationship with the general compliance component of OCB (Organ et al., 2006). However, it has also been reported that personality measures are weaker predictors of OCB when compared to attitudinal predictors (Organ &amp; Ryan, 1995).

Task characteristics such as feedback, routinization, and intrinsic satisfaction are found to be significantly related to altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. Positive relationships were found between both task feedback and intrinsic satisfaction and OCB, while a negative relationship was found between task routinization and OCB. Even though task characteristics have been found to predict OCB, some debate exists as to whether this is a direct effect or a relationship mediated by job satisfaction (Todd &amp; Kent, 2006).

Leadership behaviors have also been found to be an important predictor of OCB. These behaviors fall into four categories: transformational leadership behavior, transactional leadership behavior, behaviors having to do with the path-goal theory of leadership, and behaviors having to do with the leader-member exchange theory. Transformational leadership behaviors, including articulating a vision, providing an appropriate model, fostering the acceptance of group goals, high performance expectations, and intellectual stimulation, have significant positive relationships with Organ&#x27;s dimensions of OCB. Two types of behaviors representative of transactional leadership style, contingent reward behavior and non-contingent punishment behavior, have significant relationships with Organ&#x27;s dimensions of OCB. Additionally, both the supportive leadership and leader role clarification aspects of the path-goal theory of leadership are positively related to OCB. Podsakoff et al. (2000) found that leader-member exchange was positively related to altruism and an overall composite measure of OCB.

==Consequences==
During the early 1990s, scholars gained real momentum in the area of OCB with regard to empirical research. Empirical research regarding the consequences of OCBs has focused on two main areas: organizational performance and success and managerial evaluations of performance and reward allocation. Some evidence also exists on the impacts of OCB on the employees themselves.

===Organizational performance and success===

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have been conducted to look at the relationship between OCBs and organizational performance and success. Podsakoff and MacKenzie (1994, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) looked at an insurance agency and found that the OCBs civic virtue and sportsmanship were both significantly related to indices of sales performance. Podsakoff, Ahearne, and MacKenzie (1997, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) examined paper mill workers and found that helping behavior was significantly related to product quality. MacKenzie, Podsakoff, and Ahearne (1996, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) found that civic virtue and helping behavior were significantly related to the percent of team quota sales. Walz and Niehoff (2000) examined 30 different restaurants and found that helping behavior was significantly related to operating efficiency, customer satisfaction, and quality of performance. Researchers found that helping behavior was also negatively correlated with wasted food. Koys (2001, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) used a combination of OCB dimensions to form a composite measure of OCB. Results from this study indicated that the composite measure of OCB was positively correlated with restaurant profits.

More recently, Podsakoff, Blume, Whiting, and Podsakoff (2009) found that OCBs were positively related to unit-level performance and customer satisfaction. Nielsen, Hrivnak, and Shaw (2009), in their meta-analytic review of the existing group literature, examined the relationship between OCBs and performance at the group level. These researchers found a positive and significant relationship between overall OCB and performance at the group level. In addition, Nielsen et al. (2009) found that similar patterns of relationships existed for each dimension of OCB: civic virtue, sportsmanship, altruism, conscientiousness, and courtesy.

=== Managerial evaluations and reward allocations ===
With regard to the relationship between OBs and managerial evaluations, Podsakoff and colleagues (2000) found, in a summary of empirical evidence, that OCBs uniquely accounted for 42.9% of the variance in managerial performance evaluations. Results from this study also indicated that altruism or helping was significantly related to performance evaluations in eight out of the ten studies it was included in; sportsmanship was significantly related to performance evaluations in five out of the eight studies it was included in; conscientiousness was significantly related to performance evaluations in all three of the studies it was included in; and civic virtue was significantly related to performance evaluations in six out of the eight studies it was included in.

More recently, Podsakoff et al. (2009) found that OCBs have a positive relationship with performance ratings and reward allocations. Podsakoff, Whiting, Podsakoff, and Mishra (2010) examined the effects of job candidates&#x27; tendency to exhibit OCBs on selection decisions made in the context of a job interview. These researchers found that candidates whose interview responses indicated a tendency to engage in helping others, challenge the status quo by voicing their opinions, and support and defend an organization were generally viewed as more competent, received higher overall evaluations, and received higher recommended starting salaries than those who did not.

Research has also looked at the relationship between task-performance, CWB, and OCB with overall managerial evaluations. When compared with task-performance and CWB, OCB is found to contribute least to overall managerial evaluations (Rotundo &amp; Sackett, 2002). This somewhat inconsistent pattern of results across the OCB literature with regard to antecedents exemplifies the need for more research in this area.

=== The effects of OCB on employees ===
There is some tension visible in the existing literature on the effects of OCB on the employees who perform these citizenship behaviours. Allowing employees some scope to work outside their formal roles is thought to enhance the employee experience and lower turnover intentions and actual turnover (Podsakoff et al., 2009). However, these benefits of OCB appear to come at a cost. Emotional exhaustion and conflict between home life and work are both higher for conscientious employees, and these effects are stronger amongst employees exhibiting high in-role performance (Deery, Rayton, Walsh and Kinnie, 2016).

=== Citizenship fatigue ===
Citizenship fatigue occurs when OCB activities contribute to an employee “feeling worn out, tired, or on edge,” which in turn leads to reduced future OCB activity. While performance of job duties may remain high, the nature of OCB as additional activity can see atrophy through employee exhaustion. Citizenship fatigue acts on both affect and cognition meaning that a sense of OCB burnout can be coupled with the perception that OCB activities are causing the feelings of burnout.

A study of 273 employees over multiple points in time found that “perceived organisational support, quality of team-member exchange (TMX) relationships, and pressure to engage in OCB” affect the interplay between OCB and citizenship fatigue. A perceived lack of support from the organisation correlates with citizenship fatigue, which workers may compensate for in other areas, such as working longer hours. Older workers were less likely to report citizenship fatigue.

High citizenship pressure does not appear to correlate to citizenship fatigue rates, but where citizenship pressure is low, higher OCB levels correlated with decreased citizenship fatigue. Further, TMX situations where employees are conscientious and supportive of each other&#x27;s interests appear to decrease citizenship fatigue, although low-TMX seems to have nil impact.

Citizenship fatigue is reduced where OCB enjoys high organisational support, high-quality TMX relationships, and pressure to engage in OCB is low. Conversely, citizenship fatigue is amplified when perceived organisational support is low, TMX relationships are low in quality, and there is perceived pressure to engage in OCB.

=== Career outcomes ===
A study of the relationship between OCB, task performance, and career outcomes in outcome-based professional services gauged potential consequences of OCB engagement. Time spent on task performance and OCB were positively related to performance evaluations, which in turn strongly determine promotion. Controlled for advancement speed, however, performance evaluation merely allows entry into a “tournament” where the most deserving candidate for promotion “wins.” Task performance determines speed of advancement, so time spent on OCB can contribute to a slower promotion rate.

Task performance also appears to be more important than OCB in an outcome-based system, where OCB participation correlates “significantly and negatively” to task performance. In a professional services firm where a consultant&#x27;s time is the outcome, the OCB/task performance trade off is “immediate and apparent.” In a sales-oriented firm the effect lags and is less apparent because the outcome of sales productivity is not immediately manifest.

There is a cost indicated to individuals engaging in OCB in an outcome-based system, with task performance proving much more important for increasing salary and enabling promotion. Conversely, OCB correlates negatively to salary and has nil impact on promotion. In short, OCB participation in may distract from task performance and negatively impact career advancement in an outcome-based system.

=== Workplace happiness ===
A study of 260 hospital physicians found workplace happiness positively affected OCB, with diversity management perceptions mediating the relationship between them. Diversity management enabled satisfaction with leaders, work environment and job tasks, but also enhanced feelings of respect, fair treatment, and inclusion, despite outward differences. In turn, this encouraged OCB activity such as inter-colleague assistance, working to high standard, organisational affiliation, and conflict resolution.

Findings are in line with attitudinal theory, in which a worker&#x27;s positive behaviour is mainly formed by their perception of a positive attitude from their employer, but also reflects social exchange theory wherein a worker cares about their organisation where they experience “economic and sociopsychological appreciation.” Engagement, job satisfaction and emotional attachment to the organisation are often translated into OCBs including “passion, proactivity, persistence and affiliation” for organisational betterment.

=== Presenteeism ===
Presenteeism is where employees attend work despite ill-health. A study viewing presenteeism through Social Information Processing (SIP) Theory found that presenteeism has a positive indirect effect on co-workers&#x27; OCB activities through citizenship pressure. According to SIP theory, individuals are adaptive, and able to modify beliefs and behaviours to a given social environment. Citizenship pressure is a key social theoretical mechanism which encourages co-workers of presentees to engage in OCBs, in response to a change in the operating environment.

It is also suggested that presenteeism itself is an OCB, in that it surpasses the formal demands of a role, supports organizational functioning, and is generally unrewarded. In turn, employees who perceive citizenship pressure enact their own OCBs.

The authors posit that psychological detachment from the organisation is the moderator between OCB and citizenship pressure, as psychological distance from the organisation enables the individual to respond to specific environmental cues. Conformity is toward social stimuli in the immediate environment, informed by citizenship pressure. In turn, the authors reason, that “employees who are high on psychological detachment are more likely to conform to citizenship pressure with OCBs.”

Thus, presenteeism can both be and enable OCBs; however, care must be taken to address possible negative reactions or harmful outcomes, and to ensure presenteeism is not explicitly encouraged as a means of encouraging OCB.

== Measures ==
Researchers have developed a variety of measures for OCB. However, before being able to measure a construct it must be defined. As discussed earlier, this is not a cut and dried task. Thus, the conceptual definitions of OCB used by researches differ from study to study.

Bateman and Organ&#x27;s (1983) study was one of the first to tackle the measurement of OCB. Their definition of OCB &quot;includes any of those gestures (often taken for granted) that lubricate the social machinery of the organization but that do not directly inhere in the usual notion of task performance&quot; (Bateman &amp; Organ, 1983, p. 588). Based on this definition, they constructed a 30-item OCB scale that measured cooperation, altruism, compliance, punctuality, housecleaning, protecting company property, conscientiously following company rules, and dependability. The scale asked each participant to rate their agreement or disagreement with each of the 30 items using a 7-point scale that ranged from negative 3 to positive 3.

Another important early study was Smith et al. (1983), which took a slightly more complicated measurement approach by developing a scale in stages. In order to develop their 16-item scale, these researchers interviewed managers in manufacturing organizations and asked them to &quot;identify instances of helpful, but not absolutely required behavior&quot; (Smith et al., 1983, p. 656). The researchers created a 20-item scale based on the interviews in addition to the scale items used in the Bateman and Organ (1983) study mentioned previously. The third step involved administering the scale to a group of 67 students who had managerial experience. The students were asked to complete the scale while thinking of someone who currently, or had in the past, worked for them. Students then described the person&#x27;s work behavior and their responses to the scale items. After factor analysis, four items were dropped resulting in the 16-item scale. It is with this scale that the authors found results indicating the first two distinct dimensions of OCB: altruism and generalized compliance. Examples of items in Smith et al.&#x27;s (1983) scale include:
* Helps others who have been absent.
* Gives advance notice if unable to come to work.
* Assists supervisor with his or her work.
* Attend functions not required but that help company image.

In 1990, Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter conducted an important study using the five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, and civic virtue. These researchers developed a 24-item scale by having 10 of their colleagues sort each of the 24 items into one of the five OCB dimensions or an &quot;other&quot; category if they felt the item did not fit any of the five defined conceptual dimensions. Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement using a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; This five-factor structure has served as the building block for a substantial amount of OCB research. Examples of items in Podsakoff et al.&#x27;s (1990) scale include:
* Obeys company rules and regulations even when no one is watching.
* Attends meetings that are not mandatory, but are considered important.
* Mindful of how his/her behavior affects other people&#x27;s jobs.
* Willingly helps others who have work related problems.

<doc id="1185364" wikidata="Q978610" url="?curid=1185364" title="USS New Mexico (SSN-779)">
<text>USS &quot;New Mexico&quot; (SSN-779) is a nuclear powered fast-attack submarine of the United States Navy. She is the second U.S. warship named for the 47th state, after the early twentieth century super-dreadnought, USS &quot;New Mexico&quot; (BB-40).

&quot;New Mexico&quot; is the sixth vessel of her class, which is intended to replace the older &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class. She represents the most advanced submarine model in the U.S. Navy, incorporating the latest technologies in stealth, propulsion, intelligence gathering, and weaponry. &quot;New Mexico&quot; is designed to carry out a wide variety of blue water and littoral operations, including anti-ship warfare, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

Commissioned in March 2010, &quot;New Mexico&quot; has undertaken several naval exercises and deployments. In March 2014, &quot;New Mexico&quot; became the first &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine to surface at the North Pole. Her homeport is Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

==Construction==
&quot;New Mexico&quot; is the Navy&#x27;s sixth &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine. Construction was awarded on 14 August 2003 to Northrop Grumman Newport News, which built the submarine through a joint agreement between General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB). She was the second of six Block II submarines that were built through an improved, cost-saving method.

Construction began in January 2004 at the Electric Boat Corporation, Groton, Connecticut and Quonset Point, Rhode Island facilities, for the construction of the straight sections. The individual components were shipped to Newport News for final assembly. Her keel was laid down on 12 April 2008, and on 18 May 2008 the final hull welds were completed. She was christened on 13 December 2008, with Cindy Giambastiani, the boat&#x27;s sponsor and wife of Admiral Edmund Giambastiani. Representative Heather Wilson of the First Congressional District of New Mexico was present as the keynote speaker.

&quot;New Mexico&quot; was launched on 18 January 2009 and originally scheduled for delivery in August 2009. The date of delivery was pushed back to November and the planned commissioning date postponed to early 2010 after mechanical problems were found with her torpedo room weapons-handling system. &quot;New Mexico&quot; completed builder&#x27;s trials at the end of November 2009 and was delivered on 29 December 2009, four months ahead of the contract delivery date. She was commissioned on 27 March 2010.

==Operational history==

In February 2012, &quot;New Mexico&quot; rendezvoused with Royal Navy submarine underwater in the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, for a series of war games. Present aboard each submarine were the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope and the head of the United States Navy, Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert in a historic underwater meeting between the leaders of both navies.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The crest of &quot;New Mexico&quot; was designed in January 2007 by Emilee L. Sena, a senior at St. Pius X High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her winning design was chosen by the submarine&#x27;s crew out of 180 submissions from schools throughout the state.

The design incorporates an image of a New Mexico sunset, which casts the Sandia Mountains in the pink shade for which they are named. The red in the upper right corner represents the red in the U.S. flag, which symbolizes valor and the blood that has been sacrificed in battle. The blue in the lower left corner represents the blue of the American flag, symbolizing justice, vigilance, and perseverance. The Zia symbol represents the state flag, as well as the prominence of the sun in New Mexico; the emblem is unique in reflecting the influence of Native American people in New Mexico, as the design is commonly found in indigenous art, such as blankets and pots.

The dolphins on the sides are symbols for naval submarines; they shine with a white color to represent the white of the U.S. flag, which in turn symbolizes purity and innocence. The submarine in the center represents a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine, with bow wave signifying motion. Naval officers are depicted above the vessel holding a flag. The bird along the hull is a roadrunner (Geococcyx), the state bird of New Mexico, known as a fast, agile, and fearless hunter. The gold in the border symbolizes the naval qualities of courage, prosperity, wisdom, and confidence.

The atom symbol in the bottom left corner has two meanings: It represents the nuclear-powered nature of the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines and the fact many advancements in nuclear science have taken place in New Mexico at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

In honor of those who serve aboard the &quot;New Mexico&quot;, the football players of New Mexico State University wore the crest on the back of their helmets for the 2010 football season.

<text>Ahmose-Nefertari (Ancient Egyptian: &quot; &quot;) was the first Great Royal Wife of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She was a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I, and royal sister and wife to Ahmose I. Her son Amenhotep I became pharaoh and she may have served as his regent when he was young. Ahmose-Nefertari was deified after her death.

==Family==
Ahmose-Nefertari was a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I and the granddaughter of Senakhtenre and queen Tetisheri. Ahmose-Nefertari was born in Thebes, likely during the reign of Senakhtenre Ahmose. Ahmose-Nefertari had quite a few siblings and half-siblings, including her future husband Ahmose and King&#x27;s Son Ahmose Sapair, and her many sisters: Ahmose-Henutemipet, Ahmose-Tumerisy, Ahmose-Nebetta, Ahmose-Meritamon, Ahmose-Henuttamehu, Ahmose, and Ahmose-Sitkamose.
Ahmose-Nefertari may have married Pharaoh Kamose but, if so, there is no record of such a marriage. She did become the great royal wife of Ahmose I, with whom she had at least three sons. She is depicted on a stela from Karnak with a son named Ahmose-ankh and a son named Siamun was reburied in the royal cache DB320. But it was her son Amenhotep I who would eventually succeed his father to the throne. She was also the mother of two daughters who became Royal Wives, Ahmose-Meritamun and Ahmose-Sitamun. She may also have been the mother of Mutnofret, the wife of Thutmose I. A prince named Ramose included among the Lords of the West and known from a statue now in Liverpool, may be another son of Ahmose-Nefertari.

==Life==

Ahmose-Nefertari was born during the latter part of the 17th Dynasty, during the reign of her grandfather Senakhtenre Ahmose. Her father Seqenenre Tao fought against the Hyksos and may have lost his life during a battle. He was succeeded by Kamose. It is possible that Ahmose-Nefertari married Kamose, but no evidence exists of such a marriage.

After the death of Kamose the throne went to Ahmose I. Pharaoh Ahmose was very young and queen-mother Ahhotep I served as regent during the early years of his reign. Ahhotep would have taken precedence at court over her daughter Ahmose-Nefertari, who was the great royal wife. Ahmose I became the first king of the 18th Dynasty, and a pharaoh ruling over a reunited country.

Queen Ahmose-Nefertari held many titles, including those of hereditary princess (iryt-pꜥt), great of grace (wrt-imꜣt), great of praises (wrt-ḥswt), king&#x27;s mother (mwt-niswt), great king&#x27;s wife (ḥmt-niswt-wrt), god&#x27;s wife (hmt-ntr), united with the white crown (ẖnmt-nfr-ḥḏjt), king&#x27;s daughter (sꜣt-niswt), and king&#x27;s sister (snt-niswt). The queen was revered as &quot;Goddess of Resurrection&quot; and was arguably the most venerated woman in Egyptian history. Ancient Nubia ruling families have been said to feature strong matriarchal inclinations, a characteristic described as indisputable in the case of the 17th Dynasty.  Along with other queens of the period, it has been suggested that the matriarchal quality of Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s rule and line originated from Nubia.

A donation stela from Karnak records how king Ahmose purchased the office of &quot;Second Prophet of Amun&quot; and endowed the position with land, goods and administrators. The endowment was given to Ahmose-Nefertari and her descendants, though she was the most prominent God&#x27;s Wife of Amun. Separately the position of Divine adoratrix was also given to Ahmose-Nefertari. Records from a later era indicate that in this position she would have been responsible for all temple properties, administration of estates, workshops, treasuries and all the associated administration staff.

Amenhotep I came to power while he was still young. As his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari may have served as regent for him until he reached maturity. Because of her position as regent for her son, some speculate that she started the Valley of the Kings.

Ahmose-Nefertari is shown to be alive during the early years of the reign of Thutmose I. She is depicted in Nubia next to the Viceroy of Kush Ahmose called Turo in the company of the newly crowned king and Queen Ahmose. A vase fragment found in KV20 was inscribed with the double cartouche of king Tuthmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari and the epithet indicates the queen was alive. A large statue of queen Ahmose-Nefertari from Karnak may be one of the last statues created in her honor before she died.

==Death and deification==

Ahmose-Nefertari likely died in approximately the fifth or sixth year of Thutmose I. Her death is recorded on the stela of a wab-priest called Nefer. The text mentions that &quot;the divine consort Ahmose-Nefertari, justified with the great god lord of the West, flew to heaven&quot;. Helck proposed that the annual cult holiday (II Shemu 14) dedicated to Ahmose-Nefertari at Deir el-Medina may have commemorated the day of her death. The father of Nefer, who was likely overseer of the royal works Ineni, oversaw her burial. She was likely buried in Dra Abu el-Naga and had a mortuary temple there. When Ahmose-Nefertari died, she was deified and became &quot;Mistress of the Sky&quot; and &quot;Lady of the West&quot;.

===Mummy===

Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s mummy is assumed to have been retrieved from her tomb at the end of the New Kingdom and moved to the royal cache in DB320. Her presumed body, with no identification marks, was discovered in the 19th century and unwrapped in 1885 by Émile Brugsch. Two mummies were found in a coffin one of which was more carefully wrapped than the other. The former was assumed to be that of Queen Ahmose Nefertari by the museum authorities whilst the other was stored in a damp room which caused the mummy to decompose so much so that it was buried in the garden of the museum. Maspero at later date came to assume that the mummy buried in the garden was that of Ahmose Nefertari. The original ownership of the tomb has been challenged. Ahmose-Nefertari died in her 70s. Similarly to Tetisheri, her grandmother, her hair had been thinning and plaits of false hair had been woven in with her own to cover this up. Her body had been damaged in antiquity and was missing her right hand.

According to Grafton Elliot Smith&#x27;s description in 1912, the mummy&#x27;s skin is blackened in the same manner as the majority of other contemporary mummies. He also associates the strands tied to her own hair with those of Nubian women&#x27;s hair at the time of his writing. He adds that the shape of the cranium firmly supports her foreign origin. Several authors highlight the significant prominence of Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s front teeth as revealed in X-ray images, and also characterized as severe maxillary or dental-alveolar prognathism. The same authors bring attention to the presence of the same trait in Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s grandmother Tetisheri, suggesting that it is genetically determined and inherited. Harris and Wente add that dental-alveolar prognathism is a common trait in both ancient and current Nubians at the time of their writing. It is stated that Ahmose-Nefertari shares the same pure genealogy as her mother, Ahhotep I.

In April 2021 Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s mummy was moved to National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 3 other queens and 18 kings in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

===Iconography===


In the Theban region – and especially in the village of Deir el-Medina – Ahmose-Nefertari is mentioned or depicted in at least 50 private tombs and on a large number of objects which are datable from the reign of Thutmose III to the end of the 20th Dynasty.

In the tomb of Tetyky (TT15), the queen is depicted wearing a brow ornament with two uraei instead of a double gazelle. According to Eaton-Krauss, this is the &quot;earliest occurrence of the double uraeus, which is a standard part of queenly regalia thereafter.&quot;

Michel Gitton acknowledges Norman de Garis Davis&#x27; estimate that Ahmose-Nefertari is depicted with dark complexion (black) four times more often than light complexions (red and yellow). He indicates that his own survey suggests a much lower figure although he could not provide a general figure as he could not himself verify the colors on site. He also noted there are other cases in which she is shown with a pink, golden, dark blue, or dark red skin color. As observed by Gardiner, in some instances Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s skin is blue, a popular color symbolizing fertility, birth, rebirth and life and usually used to depict water and the heavens.

In 1981 Gitton called the issue of Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s black color &quot;a serious gap in the Egyptological research, which allows approximations or untruths&quot;. He pointed out that there is no known depiction of her painted during her lifetime (she is represented with the same light skin as other represented individuals in tomb TT15, before her deification); the earliest black skin depiction appears in tomb TT161, circa 150 years after her death. Barbara Lesko wrote in 1996 that Ahmose-Nefertari was &quot;sometimes portrayed by later generations as having been black, although her coffin portrait gives her the typical light yellow skin of women.&quot;

Highlighting Ahmose-Nefertari and her son&#x27;s deification as patrons of Deir el-Medina as well her worship as &#x27;Mistress of the Sky&#x27;, &#x27;Lady of the West&#x27; and goddess of resurrection, Joyce Tyldesley indicates in 2006 that frequently in this setting she was depicted with black skin which symbolizes &quot;fertility and rebirth rather than decay&quot;. Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes states in 2000 that her black skin color can be attributed to her role as deified patron of Deir el-Medina, the color black being a reflection of &quot;fertile earth and of the Netherworld and death&quot; In 2011, Graciela Gestoso Singer states that her black or blue skin color is &quot;a reference to her position as the mother of Egypt&quot; and indicative of her role as a goddess of resurrection, since black is the color of death, the underworld, rebirth and fertility, as well as the fertile land of Egypt. In 2003, Betsy Bryan wrote in &quot;The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt&quot; that &quot;the factors linking Amenhotep I and his mother with the necropolis region, with deified rulers, and with rejuvenation generally was visually transmitted by representations of the pair with black or blue skin – both colours of resurrection.&quot; In 2004 Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton recognized in a later depiction of the queen, &quot;the black skin of a deity of resurrection&quot; in connection to her role as a patron goddess of the Theban necropolis. In 2009 Eleni Vassilika, noting that in a wooden statuette of the queen (now at the Museo Egizio) the face is painted black but the arms and feet are light in color, argued that the reason for the black coloring in that case was religious and not genetic. In 2014, Margaret Bunson wrote that &quot;the unusual depictions of Ahmose-Nefertari in blue-black tones of deification reflect her status and cult.&quot; In a wooden votive statue of Ahmose-Nefertari, currently in the Louvre museum, her skin was painted red, a color commonly seen symbolizing life or a higher being, or elevated status.

Early 20th century archaeologists made observations on Ahmose-Nefertari&#x27;s likely phenotype and genealogy, and also on the probable symbolic meaning of her most frequent representation in black or purplish black skin tones. In 1974, Cheikh Anta Diop described her as &quot;typically negroid.&quot; In the controversial book &quot;Black Athena&quot;, Martin Bernal intimated that members of the royal family to which Ahmose-Nefertari belonged may have originated from Nubia, and, according to him, 18th dynasty pharaohs could generally be referred to as black. Bernal&#x27;s work has been embraced by Afrocentrists, but rejected by mainstream Egyptologists.

<text>Valko Velyov Chervenkov () (6 September 1900 – 21 October 1980) was a Bulgarian communist politician. He served as leader of the Communist Party between 1949 and 1954, and Prime Minister between 1950 and 1956. 

His rule was marked by the consolidation of the Stalinist model, rapid industrialisation, collectivisation and large-scale persecution of political opponents.

Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 had repercussions for his regime in Bulgaria. In 1954, Chervenkov accepted the Soviet model of collective leadership and handed over his post as party leader to Todor Zhivkov. The government also released a large number of political prisoners and directed its economic policy towards improving living standards rather than accelerating industrialization.

==Biography==
=== Early life and career in the Soviet Union ===
Chervenkov was born in Zlatitsa, Bulgaria in to a peasant family. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1919 and participated in communist youth group activities and newspaper editing. He took part in the failed 1923 September Uprising and was sentenced to death, but was allowed to emigrate to the Soviet Union.

In 1925, Chervenkov fled to the Soviet Union. He attended the International Lenin School in Moscow and eventually became its director. He became a supporter of the governing style of Joseph Stalin and was known for his high wit and knowledge of Marxism–Leninism. He was recruited as an agent in the NKVD under the alias &quot;Spartak&quot;. In 1941, Chervenkov became the director of a radio station which sent anti-nazi and pro-communist messages to the Bulgarian nation.

=== In Bulgaria ===

In 1944, Chervenkov returned to Bulgaria on a mission for his brother-in-law, Georgi Dimitrov. Chervenkov became a member of the government which took office soon after the end of World War II in 1945 which quickly came to be controlled by Communists. He became minister of culture in 1947, and became deputy prime minister in 1949. Shortly afterwards, Bulgarian leader Georgi Dimitrov died and Bulgaria temporarily adopted a model of collective leadership. Chervenkov succeeded Dimitrov as general secretary of the party, and Vasil Kolarov took Dimitrov&#x27;s other post of prime minister. This only lasted a year before Kolarov died in 1950. At that time, Chervenkov became prime minister as well and once again combined the two most powerful posts in Bulgaria, with full Soviet approval.

Chervenkov&#x27;s policies closely resembled those of the Soviet Union at the time, which earned him the nickname &quot;Little Stalin&quot;. His rule featured harsh repression of all deviation from the party line, arbitrary suppression of culture and the arts along the lines of Socialist realism, and an isolationist foreign policy. He also became the object of a personality cult. In 1950, a collectivization campaign was launched. By early 1951, Chervenkov had expelled one in five party members, including many high officials, in his campaign for complete party discipline. Out of 460,000 members, 100,000 were expelled from the party by 1953. Although Chervenkov&#x27;s personality cult model was similar to that of Stalin - various places were named after him like the Medical University in Sofia and one of the city&#x27;s districts. He personally accepted it only as a necessity of the current political situation and strongly opposed any extremities.

By 1953, Bulgaria had cut ties with the West and 90% of its exports and imports involved Soviet partnership. Chervenkov&#x27;s cabinet used intimidation and supply discrimination to increase collectivization rates. Between 1950 and 1953, state-owned arable land increased from 12% to 61%. Despite these collectivization efforts, the 1949–1953 Five-Year Plan failed to achieve its target, marking −0.9% growth in agriculture for the period, although at the same time industry marked a 20.7% growth, while total economic growth amounted to 8.4%. Under his presidency the 1953 tobacco workers&#x27; strike in Plovdiv was violently suppressed.

Even before the death of Stalin, Chervenkov had already begun moving away from the Stalinist line. The official approval of Dimitar Dimov&#x27;s novel &quot;Tobacco&quot; marked a slight loosening of Party control over cultural activities. In 1953, formal relations with Greece and Yugoslavia were re-established, some political amnesties were granted, and planners discussed increasing production of consumer goods and reducing the prices of commodities. After 1953 Chervenkov was in an insecure position, and made several steps in order to gain political support – he gave up his leadership of the Party in 1954, reduced Soviet intervention in Bulgarian economic and political life, reduced the pace of collectivisation and released some 10,000 political prisoners by 1955. In April 1956, following Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinisation, the Bulgarian Communist Party denounced Stalinism (and implicitly, Chervenkov&#x27;s authoritarianism). He resigned the same year. 

In 1961, he was banned from Politburo. In 1962, Chervenkov was expelled from the communist party for &quot;anti-party activities&quot;, although his membership was renewed in 1969 by a suggestion from Zhivkov in the context of the Soviet crushing of the Prague Spring. 

Chervenkov died in 1980 in Sofia. The communist party did not inform immediately about his death and forbade huge groups of mourners, fearing that such a ceremony may evolve into a protest against the Zhivkov rule.

==Personal life==
In 1926 Chervenkov married Georgi Dimitrov&#x27;s youngest sister, Elena. They had two children – Irina (1931–2014) and Vladimir (1935–1965).

==Honours and awards==
* Order of Lenin, four times (including 1967 and 1980)

<doc id="1185379" wikidata="Q3565622" url="?curid=1185379" title="Halfway house">
<text>A halfway house is a type of prison or institute intended to teach (or reteach) the necessary skills for people to re-integrate into society and better support and care for themselves. Halfway houses are typically either state sponsored for those with criminal backgrounds, or privately run for those with substance abuse issues.

As well as serving as a residence, halfway houses can provide social, medical, psychiatric, educational, and other similar services. They are termed &quot;halfway houses&quot; due to their being halfway between completely independent living and in-patient or carceral facilities, where residents are highly restricted in their behavior and freedoms. 

The term has been used in the United States since at least the Temperance Movement of the 1840s.

==Definitional problems==

There are several different types of halfway houses. Some are state sponsored, while others (mainly addiction recovery homes and mental illness homes) are run by &quot;for profit&quot; entities. In criminology the purpose of a halfway house is generally considered to be that of allowing people to begin the process of reintegration with society, while still providing monitoring and support. This type of living arrangement is often believed to reduce the risk of recidivism or relapse when compared to a straight release directly into society.

Some halfway houses are meant solely for reintegration of persons who have been recently released from prison or jail; some are meant for people with chronic mental health disorders; others are for people with substance abuse issues, generally called sober living houses. The state-placement of ex-criminal offenders to a &quot;halfway house&quot; after a prison sentence may either be decided upon as part of the judge&#x27;s sentence or by a prison official&#x27;s recommendation. A direct sentence to a halfway house can also be decided upon by a judge or prosecutor in lieu of prison time.

==National differences==

===United States===
The majority of programs in the United States make a distinction between a halfway house and a sober/recovery house. A halfway house has an active rehabilitation treatment program run throughout the day, where the residents receive intensive individual and group counseling for their substance abuse while they establish a sober support network, secure new employment, and find new housing. Residents stay for one to six months.

Residents of work release housing are frequently required to pay rent on a &quot;sliding scale&quot; which is often dependent on whether or not they can find a job while in residence. In addiction-recovery houses, a resident&#x27;s stay is sometimes financed by health insurance. In addition, a stay in a recovery house might be a partial requirement of a criminal sentence. Residents are normally asked to remain sober and comply with a recovery program.

In certain areas, a halfway house is much different from a recovery house or sober house. In these areas, a drug and alcohol halfway house is licensed by the Department of Health and has staff coverage 24 hours a day. This staff includes a clinical treatment team.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;halfway house&quot; can refer to a place where people with mental disorders, victims of child abuse, orphans, or teenage runaways stay. The latter are often run by charities, including the Church of England, other churches, and community groups. Residential places for offenders on bail are known as bail hostels, and probation-supervised accommodation for offenders post-release are known as Approved Premises. However, the expression &quot;halfway house&quot; more usually refers to something combining features of two other things, for example a solution to a problem based on two ideas.

===Canada===
In Canada, halfway houses are often called &quot;Community-Based Residential Facilities&quot;. The Correctional Service of Canada definition of a halfway house is similar to the general American definition of one.

==Programming integrity==
With regard to programming integrity, findings regarding the ability of transitional housing to reduce recidivism or help addiction recovery have been mixed. Many criminologists have conducted research of halfway house facilities that provide housing for low risk criminals after institutionalization. Risk screening for residents is considered essential in order to preserve both institutional and community safety.

==NIMBY effect== 
Residents of neighborhoods in which halfway houses attempt to locate often oppose their establishment. Social justice literature observes the relationships between halfway house siting and the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) phenomenon. Some communities/neighborhoods may have the ability to affect political legislation through political solidarity while others may not. Some research stresses that community residents simply feel nervous when halfway houses are sited near them. Others point out that the presence of transitional residences may pose real hazards to community safety. NIMBY research suggests that a neighborhood&#x27;s resistance to placement may be linked to class-based prejudices about ex-offenders and drug addicts. argue that NIMBY responses are sometimes associated with mistrust of government sponsors.

<doc id="1185387" wikidata="Q5020367" url="?curid=1185387" title="California Cougars">
<text>The California Cougars were an indoor soccer team, founded in 2004. The team was a charter member of the Professional Arena Soccer League (PASL-Pro), the first division of arena (indoor) soccer in North America.

They played their home matches at the Stockton Arena in Stockton, California. Their team colors were red, gold and black. The team&#x27;s head coach was Antonio Sutton.

==History==
In February 2004, John Thomas, a real estate developer, purchased an expansion team in the Major Indoor Soccer League for Stockton, California. The team was named the California Cougars so that it would represent all of northern California as a regional team.

The first general manager was Dennis Lukens, a former &quot;A&quot; League GM who oversaw the start up operation. He was succeeded by Emily Ballus, a former executive with the WUSA. Because it is only south of Sacramento, the team hoped to draw fans of the old Sacramento Knights of the CISL and WISL. The team began play in the 2005–2006 season after the construction of its arena. In August 2006, the team was purchased by Rick and Greg Toy and their brother in-law Jim Rachels.

In May 2008, the team announced that it was joining the Professional Arena Soccer League and would be renamed the Stockton Cougars. In April 2009, local businessman Fred Walke purchased majority interest in the franchise. For the 2009–2010 season Stockton Cougars went back to calling itself California Cougars.

<doc id="1185391" wikidata="Q5416188" url="?curid=1185391" title="Eve Merriam">
<text>Eve Merriam (July 19, 1916 – April 11, 1992) was an American poet and writer.

==Writing career==
Merriam&#x27;s first book was the 1946 &quot;Family Circle&quot;, which won the Yale Younger Poets Prize. In 1956, she published &quot;Emma Lazarus: Woman with a Torch&quot;. Her book, &quot;The Inner City Mother Goose&quot; (1969), was described as one of the most banned books of the time. It inspired a 1971 Broadway musical called &quot;Inner City&quot;, later revived in 1982 under the title &quot;Street Dreams&quot;.

In 1981, she won the NCTE Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children. One of her books for children is &quot;Halloween ABC&quot;. She published over 30 books, and taught at both City College and New York University.

In 1977, composer Patsy Rogers used Merriam’s text for her opera &quot;Woman Alive: Conversation Against Death&quot;. The play &quot;Out of Our Father&#x27;s House&quot;, adapted by Merriam, Jack Hofsiss and Paula Wagner from Merriam&#x27;s book &quot;Growing Up Female in America&quot;, with music by Ruth Crawford Seeger, was televised on the &quot;Great Performances&quot; series in 1978.

==Personal life==
Born Eva Moskovitz in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Eve Merriam was one of four children of Russian Jewish immigrants Max Moscovitz and Jennie Siegel. After graduating with an A.B. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937, Merriam moved to New York to pursue graduate studies at Columbia University. She was married four times, with the first three ending in divorce: Erwin Spitzer (1939-1947), Martin Michel (1947-1960), and Leonard C. Lewin (1963-1980). She married screenwriter Waldo Salt in 1983 and remained with him until his death in 1987, and in the process became Jennifer Salt&#x27;s stepmother.

===Death===
Merriam died on April 11, 1992, in Manhattan from liver cancer; she was 75.

<text>Herrnhut (; ; ; Upper Lusatian: &quot;Harrnhutt&quot;, &quot;Harrnutt&quot;) is a town of around 6,000 inhabitants in Upper Lusatia, in the district of Görlitz, in eastern Saxony, Germany. The town is mainly known as the place of origin of the community of the Moravian Church (established by Nicolas Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf in 1722), and of the Moravian Stars (&quot;Herrnhuter Sterne&quot;).

In 2016, the town was awarded the honorary title &quot;European City of the Reformation&quot; by the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe, and in 2024, Herrnhut was inscribed on the World Heritage List as part of the serial site &quot;Moravian Church Settlements&quot; (&quot;Siedungen der Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde&quot;) alongside Christiansfeld (Denmark), Bethlehem (USA) and Gracehill (Northern Ireland). Herrnhut lies between the larger towns of Löbau and Zittau in the hilly foreland of the Zittau Mountains on the Petersbach, the longest headstream of the Pließnitz, a tributary of the Lusatian Neisse.

==Geography==
It is located in the historic Upper Lusatia region, on the road Bundesstraße 178, and on the Zittau–Löbau railway line. Herrnhut is about south-east of Löbau, north-west of Zittau, and south-west of the district capital Görlitz.

The municipality borders on, among other municipalities, Oderwitz.

===Subdivisions===
Herrnhut is also the name of the largest town in the municipality. Since 1 January 2013, when Berthelsdorf was incorporated, the municipal area contains 11 subdivisions:
* Herrnhut (original town)
* Ninive
* Ruppersdorf
* Schwan
* Friedensthal
* Strahwalde
* Euldorf
* Großhennersdorf
* Heuscheune
* Neundorf auf dem Eigen
* Schönbrunn
* Berthelsdorf
* Rennersdorf/O.L.

==History==

Herrnhut proper was founded in the early 18th century by German-speaking members of the Unity of the Brethren, religious refugees from Margraviate of Moravia. The Unity of the Brethren arose after the reformer Jan Hus had been burnt at the stake during the Council of Constance in 1415. In the 18th century, they had to face the stern Counter-Reformation measures enacted in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown by the Habsburg rulers. From 1722 refugees came to Upper Lusatia, held by the Electors of Saxony since the Peace of Prague (1635). After meeting with their leader Christian David, a Moravian missionary, the German nobleman Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700–1760) invited them to settle on his extended Berthelsdorf estates.

Shortly afterward, David built the first home in what was to become Herrnhut. &quot;Herrn Hut&quot; means the Lord&#x27;s watchful care or the Lord&#x27;s protection. Zinzendorf himself had a new residence erected here in 1725–1727). From Herrnhut the community spread to Rixdorf near Berlin, the former Marienborn monastery near Büdingen, to Herrnhaag, to Norden, to Pawlowitzke (1771–1772). Numerous daughter churches arose all over the world. The first organized Protestant missionary movement began from Herrnhut in 1732, when 2 Bohemian Brethren went to the Danish West Indies, and then others went also to Greenland. The first North American mission work began in Savannah, Georgia in 1735. In 1738, the missionary station of Genadendal was founded in South Africa. Christiansfeld in Denmark followed in 1771.

Herrnhut holds a prominent place in the history of Protestantism, as well as the broader history of Christianity. Zinzendorf&#x27;s community influenced John Wesley in creating Methodism and it contributed to the rise of Evangelicalism, a broad interdenominational movement of more than 300 million people all over the globe.

==Population==
According to the Saxon state congress in 1777, Herrnhut contained 76 homes.

In the mid-19th century the population rose above 1,000, and after World War II it reached more than 2,000. Since the 1950s there has been a decline in population, which was compensated for by the incorporation of neighboring municipalities.

==Location maps==
==Coat of arms==
The Herrnhut coat of arms is blue and white, showing the tower of the &quot;Altan&quot; (the lookout tower) atop the Hutberg hill above the city. The name of Hutberg hill (&quot;Hill of Watching&quot;) suggested the name of the Moravian settlement founded by these exiles on the Zinzendorf estate in 1722. &quot;Herrn Hut&quot; means &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Watchful care&quot;.

==Culture==
Herrnhut has a church and two museums, including a museum of local history. It is the center of the worldwide Moravian Church, the Unitas Fratrum, in German &quot;Brüder-Unität&quot; or &quot;Brüdergemeine&quot;. Many European languages have named the Moravian Church movement directly after Herrnhut, for example &quot;hernhuutlus&quot; in Estonian, &quot;herrnhutilaisuus&quot; in Finnish, &quot;hernhūtieši&quot; in Latvian and &quot;herrnhutismen&quot; in both Norwegian and Swedish.

The former Herrnhut train station on the decommissioned railway line Zittau–Löbau has been turned into an art gallery.

==Economy==
Its economy is based on church administration, education, tourism and manufacturing, including a 25-pointed star that is often hung in windows and on porches during the Christmas season, which has been produced for over 150 years. It is called the Moravian star or Moravian Advent star (&quot;Herrnhuter Adventsstern&quot; or simply &quot;Herrnhuter Stern&quot;). From Herrnhut, the Moravian star decoration has spread across Europe and America.

<text>Colonel Claud Thomas Bourchier (22 April 1831 – 19 November 1877) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 23 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

==Action==
On 20 November 1854 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Lieutenant Bourchier, with another lieutenant (William James Montgomery Cuninghame) was with a party detailed to drive the Russians from some rifle pits. Advancing on the pits after dark they launched a surprise attack and drove the Russian riflemen from their cover, but in the fierce fighting which ensued the officer in command of the party was killed. The two lieutenants, however, maintained their advantage, withstood all attacks from the enemy during the night and held the position until relieved next day.

He later achieved the rank of colonel. In later life he was a member of Boodle&#x27;s club in St James&#x27;s, London.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, England.

<text>Berthelsdorf () is a former municipality in the district of Görlitz, in the southeastern part of Saxony, Germany. On 1 January 2013, it was incorporated into the town of Herrnhut.

== History ==
Berthelsdorf lies close to the borders of the Czech Republic and Poland. Nicolaus Ludwig Count von Zinzendorf, bought the Berthelsdorf estates (Middle and Lower Berthelsdorf) from his grandmother, Henriette Catharina von Gersdorff, in 1722, and Upper Berthelsdorf from his Uncle in 1724. He built his manor house &quot;Bethel&quot; - &quot;House of God&quot; in Middle Berthelsdorf. Soon after buying the estates and calling Johann Andreas Rothe as pastor of the Lutheran parish in Berthelsdorf, he agreed to receive Protestant exiles from the &quot;Kuhländchen&quot; (de, cs) in Moravia upon his new estate.

The first group arrived in June, 1722, under the leadership of carpenter Christian David. They founded the nearby settlement of Herrnhut on the estate.
They were later joined by several hundred other refugees from Habsburg oppression in Bohemia/ Moravia, now the Czech Republic. Under the guidance of Zinzendorf they united to renew the ancient Unitas Fratrum. 13 August 1727, is the date usually considered as the renewal date, which took place in the parish church in Berthelsdorf. From Berthelsdorf and Herrnhut then the &quot;Brüdergemeine&quot;, in English, the Moravian Church, spread out across the world, beginning in 1732 with the sending of the first Moravian missionaries.

Zinzendorf also provided sanctuary in Berthelsdorf to persecuted followers of mystic Caspar Schwenckfeld from nearby Silesia. They were forced by the Electoral Saxon government to emigrate to Pennsylvania, and Zinzendorf sent two Moravians to accompany them in 1734–35, in order to scout out the mission possibilities in America.

The former municipality had two subdivisions: Rennersdorf and Berthelsdorf.

== People ==

<text>Rowland Richard Louis &quot;Rowley&quot; Bourke, (28 November 1885 – 29 August 1958) was a Canadian farmer, sailor, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Bourke was born in London, England, and emigrated to Canada in 1902. He returned to the United Kingdom on the outbreak of the First World War, and after initially being rejected due to poor eyesight, he enlisted in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1916.

==Early life==
Born on 28 November 1885 in London, England, Bourke moved to Canada in 1902. He became a miner in the Klondike and a fruit grower in British Columbia. In January 1916, he volunteered for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

==Naval career==
===First World War===
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Bourke volunteered to enlist in the Canadian military. He was rejected by all three arms of service due to poor eyesight. Undeterred, Bourke returned to England, at his own expense, where he successfully joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving on motor launches.

In April 1918, Bourke volunteered his motor launch to participate in the blockading of the Belgian harbour of Zeebrugge-Ostend, during the First Ostend Raid. The motor launches were detailed to rescue personnel from ships sunk in the blockade effort. Initially rejected from participating due to his eyesight, Bourke continued to volunteer his launch, despite knowing that volunteering put him and his crew in great peril. During action on the night of 23 April, Bourke&#x27;s launch picked up 38 sailors from the blockship and towed the crippled ML 532 out of the harbour. For showing &quot;the greatest coolness and skill in handling his motor-launch&quot;, Bourke was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

On 9 and 10 May 1918 at Ostend, Belgium, after the crew of had been taken off, Bourke, commanding Motor Launch 276, went into the harbour to check that everybody had got away. After searching and finding no one, he withdrew, but hearing cries from the water he turned back, found an officer and two seamen clinging to an up-turned boat, and rescued them. During this time the motor launch was under very heavy fire and was hit 55 times, once by a 6-inch shell, which killed two crew and did considerable damage. Lieutenant Bourke, however, managed to take the motor launch into the open sea, and was taken in tow. In recognition of his gallantry and devotion to duty, Bourke was gazetted the Victoria Cross on 27 August 1918.

===Second World War===
Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Bourke was instrumental in organizing a Fishermen&#x27;s Reserve, to patrol the west coast of Canada. He served as a recruiting officer for a period of time but in 1941 he returned to sea, with the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve. He served as commander of , , and HMCS &quot;Burrard&quot;, Vancouver. He ended his naval career in 1950 with the rank of commander.

==Death and legacy==
Bourke is buried in section O, plot 10, grave 16 in Royal Oak Burial Park, Falaise Drive, Victoria, British Columbia. His medals are held at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa.

The Canadian Hydrographic Service named Mount Bourke in 1945. It is located southwest of Megin Lake and northeast of Hot Springs Cove, north of Tofino, British Columbia. Mount Bourke is located at latitude 49°27′56 and longitude 126°11′02.

, Victoria&#x27;s Naval Reserve Division, honours Bourke at his gravesite in Royal Oak Burial Park with a graveside ceremony each Remembrance Day.

<doc id="1185431" wikidata="Q5251066" url="?curid=1185431" title="Defalcation">
<text>In financial and legal usage, defalcation may involve misappropriation of funds by a person trusted with their charge; also, the act of misappropriation, or an instance thereof. A common example of defalcation would be skimming. 

The United States Bankruptcy Code specifically uses the term defalcation to describe a category of acts that taint a particular debt such that it cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. The United States Supreme Court addressed the issue in 2013, holding that &quot;defalcation&quot; in the context of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code requires proof of &quot;a culpable state of mind… involving knowledge of, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature of the relevant fiduciary behavior.&quot;

In accounting terminology, especially with respect to the area of audit, defalcation means a misappropriation of assets or theft of assets by employees or officers of a corporation.

Defalcation occurs when a debtor commits a bad act while acting in a fiduciary capacity. The classic example of defalcation occurs when a trustee recklessly invests in trust funds and loses the money. If the beneficiary wins a judgment against the trustee, and the trustee files for bankruptcy, the debt (the judgment) cannot be discharged in bankruptcy because the debt was the result of a defalcation.

Defalcation also applies when a debtor is acting in a fiduciary capacity. To constitute a defalcation, the conduct involves a degree of culpability that is greater than negligence, but the act does not need to rise to the level of a &quot;fraud&quot; under common law. Defalcation requires showing of conscious behavior or extreme recklessness.

The term is used in legal proceedings other than bankruptcy to refer more generally to embezzlement; it is often used in the context of the title insurance business. A title agent who misuses funds intended to be used to close insured transactions is said to be involved in a defalcation. Many title insurers have their own &quot;defalcation units&quot;.

Sometimes defalcation has been pronounced for very small amounts, as under 2 £ and cents, even if it was claimed to be an error in handling change.

==Etymology==
The term is from Latin, and is analyzed as &quot;de-&quot; &quot;off&quot; + &quot;falx&quot; &quot;sickle&quot; + &quot;-atio&quot; &quot;act of&quot;, hence literally &quot;cutting off with a sickle&quot;. There is also a verb form, &quot;defalcate&quot;.

<text>Perivale () is a London Underground station in Perivale in north-west London. It is located on the West Ruislip branch of the Central line, between Greenford and Hanger Lane stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened on its New North Main Line (now the Acton–Northolt line) on 2 May 1904. This was closed when the current London Underground station was opened on 30 June 1947, as part of the extension of the Central line to . The station was designed in 1938 by Brian Lewis, later the GWR&#x27;s chief architect, but completion was delayed by the Second World War. The finished building was modified by the architect Frederick Francis Charles Curtis. A planned tower and extended wing were never built, leaving the station smaller than intended. In July 2011, the station was one of 16 London Underground stations that were given Grade II listed status.

==Connections==
London Buses route 297 serves the station.

==TV appearances==
The front of the station featured briefly in the first episode of the 2005 BBC series &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. It also appeared in the first episode of the 1994 BBC series The Fast Show, featuring John Thomson.

<doc id="1185436" wikidata="Q7754343" url="?curid=1185436" title="The North Briton">
<text>The North Briton was a radical newspaper published in 18th-century London. The North Briton also served as the pseudonym of the newspaper&#x27;s author, used in advertisements, letters to other publications, and handbills.

Although written anonymously, &quot;The North Briton&quot; is closely associated with the name of John Wilkes. The newspaper is chiefly famous for issue number 45, the forty or so court cases spawned by that issue, and for the genesis of &quot;45&quot; as a popular slogan of liberty in the latter part of the 18th century. The paper was also known for its virulently anti-Scottish sentiment.

==History==
===1762–63===
Issues number 1 (5 June 1762) to number 44 (2 April 1763) were published on consecutive Saturdays.

The newspaper was begun in response to &quot;The Briton&quot;, a pro-government paper started by Tobias Smollett. Only eight days after that newspaper began publication, the first issue of &quot;The North Briton&quot; came out. It then came out weekly until the resignation of the Bute government.

====Issue 45====
&quot;The North Briton&quot; issue number 45 (23 April 1763) is the most famous issue of the paper. It criticized a royal speech in which King George III praised the Treaty of Paris ending the Seven Years&#x27; War. Wilkes was charged with libel (accusing the King of lying), and imprisoned for a short time in the Tower of London. Wilkes challenged the warrant for his arrest and seizure of his paper, eventually winning the case. His courtroom speeches started the &quot;Wilkes and Liberty!&quot; cry, a popular slogan for freedom of speech and resistance to power. Later that year, Wilkes reprinted the issue, which the government again seized. Before it could be burned, an assembled crowd rescued the text, and the ensuing events caused Wilkes to flee across the English Channel to France, and be eventually imprisoned again. In 1764, the British House of Commons declared Wilkes the author of number 45. Nonetheless, by the time Wilkes was released from prison in 1770, &quot;45&quot; was still a popular icon not only of Wilkes, but of freedom of speech in general.

===1768–71===
Issue numbers 47 (10 May 1768) to 218 (11 May 1771) were published
by William Bingley.

Bingley was jailed in Newgate and then in King&#x27;s Bench Prison on account of issues number 50 and 51. He was
released after two years without trial.

<text>Rear Admiral Edward Courtney Boyle, VC (23 March 1883 – 16 December 1967) was a Royal Navy officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Edward Courtney Boyle, &quot;one of the most distinguished submariners of his generation&quot;, was born on 23 March 1883 in Carlisle, then part of Cumberland, and educated at Cheltenham College.

==Naval career==
Boyle joined the Royal Navy, and HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, in 1897. He joined the submarine service in July 1904 when he was sent to the depot ship . He was soon promoted lieutenant and given command of one of the Holland-class submarines. He served in the surface fleet on from November 1908 until January 1910 when he returned to submarines.

Boyle was 32 years old, and a lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC, the citation was gazetted on 21 May 1915:

The large transport sunk by was the &quot;Gul Djemal&quot;, which was sunk in shallow waters with the loss of 2000 troops and a battery of artillery. Its sinking ended Ottoman attempts to reinforce Gallipoli by sea. In addition to Boyle&#x27;s VC, Edward Geldard Stanley and Acting Lieutenant Reginald Wilfred Lawrence were both awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and all the ratings were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

Boyle made at least two more tours into the Sea of Marmara aboard &quot;E14&quot; during the Gallipoli campaign.

==Personal life==
Boyle married Marjorie Leigh in Marylebone, London in 1912.

==Later life==
Boyle retired with the rank of rear admiral in 1932, but was recalled to serve in the Second World War. He served as Flag Officer-in-Charge, London, from 1939 to 1942.

In December 1967 Boyle was knocked down by a lorry driver on a pedestrian crossing and died of his injuries. For the last few years before his death he had resided at the Station Hotel in Sunningdale, near to Sunningdale Golf Club, where he golfed several times a week. The collision occurred a hundred yards from his hotel whilst he was crossing the A30.

His VC is displayed at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, Gosport, Hampshire.

<text>The B28, originally Mark 28, was a thermonuclear bomb carried by U.S. tactical fighter bombers, attack aircraft and bomber aircraft. From 1962 to 1972 under the NATO nuclear weapons sharing program, American B28s also equipped six Europe-based Canadian CF-104 squadrons known as the RCAF Nuclear Strike Force. It was also supplied for delivery by UK-based Royal Air Force Valiant and Canberra aircraft assigned to NATO under the command of SACEUR. In addition, certain U.S. Navy carrier based attack aircraft such as the A3D (later A-3B) Skywarrior, A4D (later A-4) Skyhawk, and A3J (later A-5A) Vigilante were equipped to carry the B28.

==Production history==
===Initial development of the IN and EX weapons===
During the design of the TX-15 in 1953 it became evident to designers that massive reductions in size and weight of thermonuclear weapons were possible. In November 1954 the TX-Theta Committee proposed the development of the WX-27 and the WX-28. The larger diameter TX-27 was intended as a missile warhead or for internal carriage in aircraft while the smaller diameter TX-28 would be internally or externally carried on high-performance bombers. In a meeting in December the possibility of a small warhead allowing for smaller missiles was considered so the use of the TX-28 as a warhead was also included.

Design of the XW-28 was given to Los Alamos National Laboratory with Sandia National Laboratories working on the non-nuclear components. In February 1955 Sandia proposed that a basic warhead assembly be designed and that different noses, afterbodies, fins and fuzes could be attached to it. Emphasis was placed on obtaining the optimum yield possible within the space and weight limitations assigned which necessitated having a much thinner case design than in previous weapons. Sandia presented a design outline of the weapon to the Division of Military Application in May 1955.

It was decided that if the weapon could not be fitted to all of the required aircraft, first priority would be given to developing a bomb designed for subsonic internal or external carriage. Designers hoped though that they could produce a weapon considerably smaller than the and diameter specified.

In April 1955 Sandia were working on the fuze design. Barometric fuzing was rejected due to the wide variety of delivery systems the weapon would use. A timer was also considered having benefits in low-level delivery missions, but it was felt that these gains were slight and did not justify the complexity of the system. Eventually, a combination of radar and contact fuzing was chosen.

Two fuze designs were under development; the first used existing components while the latter (called TX-28 Prime) required more development and used pyrotechnic-activated components. A contact backup was not initially included for the airburst design due to the concern that anti-aircraft fire might activate the contact fuze. Additionally, there was a desire to prevent fallout from a contact burst in the tactical mission.

Los Alamos informed the TX-Theta Committee in the same month that the nuclear system could enter production by January 1958, a date that matched Sandia&#x27;s availability date for the non-nuclear components.

By May 1955 the TX-28 design firmed-up. The warhead itself would be in diameter and long, with each end capped in a hemisphere. The TX-28 Prime fuze design was also rapidly advancing. The design used pyrotechnically actuated switches to control preheat current, timer selection, thermal battery arming, ground- and air-burst selection, contact fuze arming, timer motor starting, trajectory-arm-switch pressure-port sealing, gas boosting and even thermal battery monitoring. These switches were small, lightweight and resistant to shock.

A baroswitch was included to improve operational safety of the weapon. It was a two-chamber design in which one chamber would close at weapon release and then the baroswitch would measure the pressure difference between the sealed and open chamber as the weapon fell. At some point in the design the fuzing system was changed to allow for contact preclusion to be selected on the ground. With contact preclusion selected the contact fuze would be disabled in the airburst option.

The initial Mod 0 used internal initiation, but in October 1955 Sandia described progress on external initiation of the weapon which eventually became the Mod 1 design. The external initiator system consisted of a power supply, precision timer and a neutron source called an S-unit. The S-unit was a tube filled with tritium gas while one end was titanium-coated and loaded with deuterium. During function the tritium ions were accelerated into the deuterium target which fused, releasing neutrons.

The Mk-28EX Mod 0 (external) and Mk-28IN Mod 0 (internal) were design-released in June 1957 and early production was achieved in August 1958. The weapon had a diameter of . The external configuration weapon had a length of and weighed approximately with the nose section containing the fuze. In the internal configuration, the warhead section was turned around with the nose substituted for four wedge fins and the tail replaced with a blunt nose containing radar antennas and contact crystals. In this configuration the weapon had a length of and weighed approximately .

The design met almost all of the specified military requirements with some exceptions. One of these exceptions is still classified while the others were that the weapon did not have a visual indication of arming and that the weapon could not be stored for 18 months at the ready condition. Instead of a visual indication, the weapon relied on electrical signals to confirm that the weapon was not armed. The storage requirement was not met, as the weapon initially required pressure-testing at 30-day intervals.

===RE and RI weapons===

Initial discussion about a ruggedized laydown weapon was discussed in August 1955 by the TX-Theta Committee. It was noted that Soviet radar capabilities were improving and that high-altitude attacks were becoming less certain. A low-altitude approach would help overcome this but would require a weapon that could survive impact with the ground before detonating once the aircraft was a safe distance away. Sandia had been investigating the problem and believed that designing a bomb to survive an impact shock of was possible.

In October 1955 the Special Weapons Development Board met. Sandia stated that they had examined parachutes, rotochutes and retrorockets. Rotochutes could not handle the weapon&#x27;s weight, while retrorockets placed special operating restrictions on the weapon. Parachutes showed promise, but existing designs were unsuitable, with Sandia working on developing an improved parachute. Sandia had also worked on developing shock-absorbing honeycomb materials, which included drop tests from a tower to simulate the impact expected in a parachute-retarded weapon.

In early 1956, Sandia concluded that a non-impact-resistant warhead could be used to produce an interim retarded weapon and this weapon system would meet weapon objectives 2 years before the development of a true laydown weapon. The weapon would use a pilot-parachute to deploy a larger drogue-parachute. This required a new bomb tail to be designed, which might aggravate ground and aircraft-clearance problems.

Production authorization for the RE weapon was issued in January 1957 and design release made in April 1958. The changes included a new altitude-sensing arming system to replace the baroswitches based on velocity sensing. This removed certain delivery restrictions on the Mk-28 Mod 0. The design also included an acceleration-integration system to detect if the parachute did not deploy and prevent bomb-arming.

The Mk-28RE (retarded external) was long and weighed . The design consisted of the Mk-28 Mod 1 Fuze and a set of Mk-28 Mod 0 RESC (Retarded External Shape Components). It was only available with the Mod 1 warhead. The Mod 1 warhead had the same yield options as the Mod 0, but not all yield options were stockpiled.

The Mk-28RI (Retarded Internal) weapon was designed released in April 1959 and achieved production in June 1960. The design weighed and was long. The design consisted of the Mk-28 Mod 2 Fuze and the same Mk-28 Mod 0 RESC as the RE weapon. It also used the Mod 1 warhead.

===FI weapon===
 
The Mk-28FI was the true laydown weapon desired during the development of the RE and RI weapons. The weapon was based on promising results from the TX-28-X2 warhead (which became the Mod 1 warhead) and would have a full-fuzing option capability. Previous weapons required a B-52 bomber to fly at at least for the weapon to survive laydown. It was hoped that a true laydown weapon would reduce this height to under .

The proposal included requirements for delayed ground burst (laydown), retarded air burst, free-fall air burst and free-fall contact burst fuzing. The selection of air or contact burst would be selected via aircraft control equipment while the laydown option would automatically engage if the weapon was dropped below a certain pressure altitude. Most components were sourced from other programs meaning the main task of the program was developing a shock-mitigating structure and conducting fuze tests.

In August 1960 operational requirements for the TX-28-X3 warhead were issued. These requirements included the capability to survive release from and to be carried internally by the B-47 and B-52 bombers. The bomb nose was given of crushable honeycomb and another parachute was added, raising the total number to four.

The Mk-28FI weapon was design released in October 1961. The weapon was in diameter, long and weighed . The design consisted of a Mk-28 Mod 3 fuze and Mk-28 Mod 0 FISC (Full-Fuzing Internal Shape Components). The weapon could not use previous Mk-28 warheads, only being suitable for the TX-28-X3 (now called the Mod 2) and later warheads.

The laydown and retarded airburst time for the weapon was 79 seconds. In laydown mode, the weapon had to be dropped between to allow the weapon to reach the ground before the 79-second interval. Fall time at was approximately 10 seconds. Burst height in retarded airburst depended on release height. The weapon was unpredictable at releases between as either the freefall or retarded fuzing would be randomly selected.

==Variants==

Twenty different versions of the B28 were made, distinguished by their yield and safety features. The B28 used the &quot;building block&quot; principle, allowing various combinations of components for different aircraft and roles.

The principal configurations were:
* B28EX – (EXternal), streamlined external-carriage for free-fall delivery. Design specifications called for carriage by the Air Force&#x27;s B-47, B-52, B-57, B-66, F-84F, F-100, F-101 and F-105; and Navy&#x27;s AJ-1, AJ-2, A2U-1, A3D-1, A4D, F2H, F3H-2, F7U-3 and P6M.
* B28IN – (INternal) unstreamlined internal-carriage version for free-fall delivery, primarily for the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and B-52.
* B28RE – (Retarded External) streamlined external-carriage version with a parachute retarder for low-level delivery.
* B28RI – (Retarded Internal) unstreamlined internal-carriage laydown weapon. Weapon specifications call for carriage by the B-47, B52 and B-66.
* B28FI – (Full-fuzing Internal) unstreamlined internal-carriage version for laydown delivery and full-fuzing option (i.e. with parachute retarded laydown, retarded air burst, free fall air burst and free fall ground burst fuzing). Specifications called for carriage by the B-47 and B52. The B28FI did not use the Mod 0 and Mod 1 warheads, as they were not strengthened for laydown delivery.

The following mods were produced:

* Mod 0 – Used on TM-76 Mace surface-to-surface missile and the GAM-77 Hound Dog cruise missile. Mod used an internal initiator while subsequent mods used external neutron initiators.
* Mod 1 – TX-28-X2 design. Also carried by Mace and Hound Dog missiles.
* Mod 2 – TX-28-X3 design. Mod was hardened for use with the B28FI configuration.
* Mod 3 – Mod had a Cat A PAL.
* Mod 4 – Mod had a Cat B PAL. Mod was hardened for use with the B28FI configuration.

The yield variants were:

* Y1 – .
* Y2 – .
* Y3 – 
* Y4 – Fission weapon, may have been the W34 warhead.
* Y5 – 

A total of approximately 4,500 B28s were produced. The last weapons in use were retired in 1991.

==Related designs==
The W49 warhead for the Thor, Atlas, Jupiter, and Titan I ballistic missiles was a W28 Y1 warhead with internal power systems removed. It came in two yield options; the Y1 with a yield of and Y2 with a yield of . Mods 0 to 2 were internally initiated while Mods 3 to 6 were externally initiated. The initial Mod 0 warhead lacked an environmental sensing device until concerns about accidental or deliberate (sabotage) detonation were raised.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 1966 Palomares B-52 crash - Four B28FI weapons with either Mod 2 or Mod 4 warheads with Y1 yield option.
* 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash
*RAF Greenham Common

==Survivors==
Four Mark 28 training variants (BDU-16/E) on their transporter (MHU-7/M) are on display in the Cold War Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

The Canadian War Museum, in Ottawa, holds a Mark 28RE training variant in its Cold War gallery. The Mark 28 armed CF-104 Starfighters in Germany, 1963–72, under the &quot;Dual Key&quot; protocol (both the US and Canada had to agree to use, with the weapons in US custody on Canadian bases).

<doc id="1185448" wikidata="Q586990" url="?curid=1185448" title="Soul Embraced">
<text>Soul Embraced is an American Christian melodic death metal band from Little Rock, Arkansas. It was originally a side project for Rocky Gray and David Sroczynski.

== History ==
Originally a side project of drummer David Sroczynski and William &quot;Rocky&quot; Gray from Shredded Corpse formed in 1997, the band dissolved after creating one song for a metal compilation in 1998. Gray reformed the band with fellow Living Sacrifice member Lance Garvin (drums) and his brother in-law Chad Moore (vocals).

When Gray and Garvin weren&#x27;t busy with Living Sacrifice, they would hammer away with Charlie T. West at making material for their death metal side project. The band released an EP (&quot;The Fleshless EP&quot;), and three albums (&quot;For the Incomplete&quot;, &quot;This Is My Blood&quot;, &quot;Immune&quot;) over a five-year span. &quot;For the Incomplete&quot; was re-released in 2003 by the independent label Blood and Ink Records.

In 2002, the band was part of a sampler for Tarantula Promotions, titled &quot;Arachnid Terror Sampler&quot;, which featured bands such as Sanctifica, Tortured Conscience, Frosthardr and Frost Like Ashes.

Evanescence&#x27;s song &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is a cover of the Soul Embraced song &quot;My Tourniquet&quot;. From 2003 to 2007, Gray was busy with Evanescence as their drummer as well as his numerous other bands. Gray said in an interview after the release of &quot;Immune&quot; that the band planned on releasing two to three more albums and in 2006 announced two new band members: Jack Wiese on guitar and Jeff Bowie on bass. In June 2007 Jack Wiese left the band to spend more time on his other projects, and he was replaced by Devin Castle (who is also in Mourningside with Gray, Bowie, and Wiese)

Soul Embraced released &quot;Dead Alive&quot; in April 2008.

Soul Embraced stated on their Myspace that they &quot;will continue with a new guitarist next year when we get ready to record the new record&quot;. After 10 years and three records Soul Embraced parted ways with Solid State Records on amicable terms. &quot;Mythos&quot; was released on Rottweiler Records.

In 2014, it was announced that former drummer, Lance Garvin, would be rejoining with the new lineup being, Rocky Gray (lead guitar), Chad Moore (vocals), Lance Garvin (Drums), Jon Dunn (bass), and Cody Smith (rhythm guitar). In 2017, the band stated that they have a new album coming soon. The band is working on a new tour and has announced that former Bassist Jeff Bowie has rejoined and pulling double duties with Soul Embraced, and their labelmates Becoming Saints.

<text>Hanger Lane () is a London Underground station in Hanger Hill, Ealing, on the border between West and Northwest London. It is located on the West Ruislip branch of the Central line, between Perivale and North Acton stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3.

It is within walking distance of Park Royal station on the Piccadilly line. The two lines cross a little east of Hanger Lane station.

== History ==
The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened Twyford Abbey Halt just east of the site on 1 May 1904 as part of the GWR and Great Central Railway Joint Railway project (the New North Main Line) towards High Wycombe. It was closed on 1 May 1911, replaced by Brentham station to the west of the present location. That station was closed between 1915 and 1920 due to World War I economies. Brentham and most main-line stations between North Acton and West Ruislip were finally closed in 1947 when the Central line was extended from North Acton on electrified tracks built under the LPTB New Works Programme of 1935; the delay was due to World War II.

The Central line station opened on 30 June 1947 as &quot;Hanger Lane&quot; as it was near that road.

The entrance and roof of the subsurface ticket hall form the centre of the Hanger Lane Gyratory System, a complex roundabout in West London where the A40 Western Avenue crosses the A406 North Circular Road in an underpass. Passengers must use pedestrian subways under the gyratory to access the station, which is itself above ground.

In 2012 the station building exterior was repainted, refurbished and given new London Underground roundels.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

== Development ==

In 2004 the multinational Diageo company agreed to build platforms to the east for an interchange with Park Royal on the Piccadilly line, as part of its First Central business park, built on the site of the (now demolished) Guinness brewery. As of June 2022, this has not happened.

== Connections ==

London Buses routes 95, 112, 226, 483 and 487 serve the station.

<text>The Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army (UPDA) was a rebel group operating in northern Uganda from March 1986 to June 1988.

== History ==
In January 1986, the government of Ugandan President Tito Okello was overthrown by the rebel National Resistance Army (NRA) under the command of Yoweri Museveni, which took the capital city of Kampala. By March 1986, NRA forces had occupied the traditional land of the Acholi people in northern Uganda, from which President Okello came. In the same month, former Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) soldiers, which was the military of Uganda from 1980 to 1986, had sought sanctuary in southern Sudan formed the rebel Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army (UPDA) with the goal to force the NRA out of northern Uganda and reinstate the former government.

By late 1986, the UPDA had proved unable to retake towns it initially had captured and hold on to captured territory. Though it controlled much of the countryside, that did not mitigate or prevent the group&#x27;s impending defeat. Many UPDA rebels deserted, and smaller units splintered into semi-banditry groups. Many ethnic Acholis refused to accept the logical conclusion that resistance was futile and began to support the Holy Spirit Movement of Alice Auma, which promised a millenarian vision of earthly paradise or similar chiliastic groups that had sprung up, including the Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Christian Army led by Joseph Kony that would later become the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA).

After a year of increasingly desperate operations, including fierce battles among the various Acholi rebel groups for resources, the UPDA signed an accord with the NRA-led government on 3 June 1988 that called for an end to the conflict and a democratic government. The negotiations were exceptional in that they were carried out by military officers of the UPDA and the NRA. The political wing of the UPDA and the National Resistance Movement were excluded from the talks. While the UPDA co-founder Justine Odong Latek refused to accept the accord and joined the LRA, most of his officers realized that their military situation was hopeless and, by early 1989, the UPDA had ceased to exist.

== Structure ==
The UPDA had an high command, led by Justine Odong Latek. At the time of its foundation, the UPDA was organized into two divisions, split into several brigades. By 1987, the group claimed to have 15,000 members, including 1,000 Karamojong and Former Uganda National Army militants. Though the group included many ex-UNLA veterans who had considerable combat experience, the UPDA units were usually much weaker than their respective names suggested. The known units included:
* First Division - commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Angelo Okello Okello, later Joseph Obonyo; operated in Gulu area
** 50 Brigade - commanded by Captain Peter Okello; operated in southern Kitgum District
** 80 Brigade - commanded by division leader John Angelo Okello Okello
** 100 Spearhead Brigade - commanded by Major Mike Kilama; operated in Aswa County
** 115 Brigade - commanded by Captain Mark Lapyem; operated in Nwoya County
** 120 Brigade - commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Atochon Oliver North; based at Nebbi
** 130 Mobile Brigade - commanded by Major Walter Ochora
* Second Division - commanded by Major Nick Kibwota; operated around Kitgum
** 60 Brigade - commanded by Captain Richard Nyeko in 1986; transferred to First Division and led by Major Mazzoldi Lubangakene by 1987
** 70 Brigade - commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Stevenson Ojukwu, later Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Oydek
** 90 Brigade - commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Eric Odwar; based at Oryebo near Namokora

The major employer in the town is the chemical company, LONZA AG, which employs about 2,550 people. Visp is the economic centre of the region and draws workers from many surrounding towns and even from Italy. This leads to a unique situation where there are more jobs in Visp than the total population (7,700 positions for a population of about 6,700).

, Visp had an unemployment rate of 2.2%. , there were 63 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 21 businesses involved in this sector. 4,288 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 93 businesses in this sector. 3,901 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 420 businesses in this sector.

== Environmental and socioeconomic impacts of Lonza chemical factory in Visp ==
The Lonza chemical factory regularly makes headlines and causes concern, as attempted soil contamination is frequently discovered around Visp. This has, at times, led to gardens being rendered unusable, with the type, quantity, and precise locations of the contaminated soil often remaining unclear. Since 1987, it has been known that the Gamsenried landfill has, demonstrably, poisoned groundwater. Throughout the investigations and reassurances from Lonza, accusations against the company and the canton have arisen multiple times, alleging that they were concealing investigation results and not communicating transparently.

Switzerland&#x27;s environmental concerns regarding Lonza became apparent in September 2016. At that time, Lonza threatened environmental authorities that they would consider relocating to China if they were not willing to bear the costs of a legally required air filter. The threat had an impact. Ultimately, Switzerland yielded and paid millions, far exceeding the costs of such a filter. In this context, there was also a report by Swiss television, in which serious allegations against Lonza were raised. Not only was the extensive contamination from the hazardous waste site criticized, but also Lonza&#x27;s attempt to pass the costs onto the state treasury. This was particularly perplexing because Lonza consistently generated billion-dollar profits.

In 2018, it was discovered that a nicotinic acid factory at the Lonza site was responsible for around one percent of the country&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions, as the chemical synthesis route used generated nitrous oxide as a byproduct. Eventually, catalytic scrubbing technology that eliminates most of the emissions was installed in 2021.

In 2021, Lonza announced plans to create 1,200 new jobs in Visp. Lonza rapidly conducted extensive advertising both in Switzerland and internationally to fill these positions as quickly as possible. However, the municipality and the Visp region were unprepared for such an influx. Water, electricity, and accommodation facilities were not equipped to handle the needs of so many newcomers. Despite Lonza generating billions in Visp, they did not pay taxes in the Visp region. As a result, the municipality had to cover the necessary costs arising from the influx itself, which regularly led to deficits in the municipal budget. Apart from concerns about drinking water, the extreme housing shortage and the consequent soaring rental prices were also prominent issues. In May 2022, a case of social welfare made headlines, where a mother and her child were forced to live in a tent on a campsite.

== Religion ==

From the , 5,390 or 82.3% were Roman Catholic, while 306 or 4.7% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 174 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.66% of the population), there were 3 individuals (or about 0.05% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 104 individuals (or about 1.59% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There was 1 individual who was Jewish, and 250 (or about 3.82% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 10 individuals who were Buddhist and 3 individuals who were Hindu. 88 (or about 1.34% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 268 individuals (or about 4.09% of the population) did not answer the question.

== Education ==

In Visp about 2,401 or (36.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 715 or (10.9%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;). Of the 715 who completed tertiary schooling, 64.9% were Swiss men, 18.0% were Swiss women, 11.3% were non-Swiss men and 5.7% were non-Swiss women.

During the 2010–2011 school year there were a total of 910 students in the Visp school system. The education system in the Canton of Valais allows young children to attend one year of non-obligatory Kindergarten. During that school year, there 7 kindergarten classes (KG1 or KG2) and 140 kindergarten students. The canton&#x27;s school system requires students to attend six years of primary school. In Visp there were a total of 28 classes and 513 students in the primary school. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling (orientation classes), followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 397 lower secondary students who attended school in Visp. All the upper secondary students attended school in another municipality.

, there were 339 students in Visp who came from another municipality, while 250 residents attended schools outside the municipality.

Visp is home to the &quot;Mediathek&quot; library. The library has () 12,438 books or other media, and loaned out 36,395 items in the same year. It was open a total of 149 days with average of 12 hours per week during that year.

It is served by two standard gauge lines, Simplon railway and Lötschberg railway line (with services operated by Swiss Federal Railways), and a metre gauge line BVZ Zermatt-Bahn (with services operated by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn).

The railway and bus stations in Visp and Brig are starting points for many outdoor activities, trips, and tours in the surrounding mountain resorts Zermatt and Saas-Fee, lying at the foot of almost all the highest peaks in the Alps, such as Matterhorn, Monte Rosa, Dom and Weisshorn.

== Climate ==

Precipitation is lower than in other parts of Switzerland due to its location inside the high mountain ranges of the western Alps, which shields it from the precipitation falling both south and north of the Alps.

<doc id="1185457" wikidata="Q7716528" url="?curid=1185457" title="The Bens">
<text>The Bens were a rock supergroup consisting of the trio, Ben Folds, Ben Kweller and Ben Lee, which toured for &quot;the Bens Rock Over Australia tour&quot; in 2003.

== History ==

Kweller described how the trio formed, &quot;Well actually our fans noticed that we all had the same first name and had said for a long time wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we all played together. So we thought, maybe we should do that. It would be fun and we were all friends going into it. It was just a cool spontaneous thing, you know.&quot; From 14 to 28 March 2003 they played nine concerts: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Sydney (twice), Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A proposed tenth show at a Melbourne shopping centre was cancelled.

Lee, Folds and Kweller each played individual sets at the concerts, however, at the beginning and end of each set, all three played several songs as a trio. Two performances were recorded live for the &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; (the Melbourne concert) and &quot;Live at the Basement&quot; (one of the Sydney concerts) radio series. The group recorded a four-track self-titled extended play, which was initially only sold at venues, but was later released in Australia and overseas. It had been recorded in Nashville.

Several live tracks from the two radio recordings were included on the Japanese release. One track from the original EP, &quot;Just Pretend&quot;, was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003. In 2003 they contributed a cover version of &quot;Wicked Little Town&quot; to &quot;Wig in a Box&quot;, a tribute album for the musical, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;.

Though various combinations of the three members have toured together at various times, the trio have not reformed as a group, and have not recorded any more material. In a brief interview after a show in Raleigh, North Carolina, on 31 July 2010, Ben Kweller confirmed that the Bens would perform as a group on an upcoming European Tour.

== Reception ==

Jasper &quot;Jaz&quot; Lee of Oz Music Project opined that the EP&#x27;s &quot;songs have an inkling of different styles, each with a particular leaning... [they] are three great artists, each of different levels of maturity in their fields, and differing in the genre of their pursuits. Yet, apart from their mutual first names there seems to be a good connection between them that was witnessed both on stage and on this EP.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s MacKenzie Wilson felt &quot;This little four-track gem is strictly for die-hard followers. Those who enjoy Kweller and Lee as artists should also enjoy the quirky pop selection. Folds is somewhat of a father figure to the younger Bens, and together their harmonies are matchless. Each comprises a dash of humor and innocence.&quot;

<text>North Acton is a London Underground station in North Acton, West London in the London Borough of Ealing. It is on the Central line between Hanger Lane (on the West Ruislip branch) or West Acton (on the Ealing Broadway branch) and East Acton stations. The station is on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

==History==
The joint &quot;New North Main Line&quot; (NNML; the present day Acton–Northolt line) of the Great Central and Great Western opened in 1903 and its North Acton Halt railway station followed in 1904, though it was closed by 1913. The Great Western Railway (GWR) built the Ealing &amp; Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Railway, which connected the Central London Railway (CLR) with the GWR&#x27;s Ealing Broadway station. CLR trains began using the route on 3 August 1920. The stations at North Acton and were built and owned by the GWR, and both opened on 5 November 1923, the new North Acton being a short distance east of the 1904 halt. As Transport for London explains:

North of the Central line tracks were two freight lines, removed in the 1960s, running alongside the Central line as far as White City; to the north of those at a slightly higher level were the two tracks of the NNML. The NNML platforms closed when the Central line was extended on new track from North Acton to Greenford station in 1947. Today, only the outer-most NNML platform remains partially intact, having been removed in the early 1950s.

Between South Ruislip station and Old Oak Junction, the GWR line was progressively run down, and in many places it is now single-track, including the stretch running past North Acton, which was reduced to single-track in 1993. From May 2008 until December 2018 only freight trains and a once-daily passenger service provided by Chiltern Railways used this stretch of line.

The Underground station had only two platforms until 1992, whereby for operational flexibility an island platform was created by building a third platform north of the other two, where the old freight line track bed had been. The third platform became the eastbound road while the eastbound platform (now the middle platform) was resignalled to allow it to be used also for terminating and starting services. This change allows shuttle services to be run to White City from Ealing Broadway and from West Ruislip in the event of problems elsewhere on the Central line, and at certain times of the day some trains coming from central London are scheduled to terminate at North Acton .

==Today==

Passenger access is down from the booking hall, which is part-way down the southern side of the cutting with two exits up to Victoria Road.
This is the last station before the Central line splits into the West Ruislip and Ealing Broadway branches. Approximately half the trains stopping at the station head to each destination. The support centre for Carphone Warehouse and numerous other companies have offices in the vicinity. There are approximately 600 new flats directly opposite the station, and there is a Holiday Inn Express hotel next door to the station with the Ramada Encore hotel another five minutes&#x27; walk away. A Tesco Express store is also open along with a Lebanese restaurant in the opposite block.

==Development==
There have been vague and uncosted suggestions over the years to move the station to the east to provide an interchange with the North London Line. This would, however, be in an area with no extra passenger generation, and merely to move the station for interchange purposes has never been sufficient reason. The idea was revived in February 2008, when the Greater London Authority stated in a &#x27;Park Royal draft Opportunity Area Planning Framework&#x27; that

In 2004, the multinational Diageo company agreed to build Central line platforms at Park Royal station to the west of North Acton, as part of its First Central business park, built on the site of the now demolished Guinness brewery. By 2017 this had not yet happened. Such a new station might influence whether adjacent stations were ever moved (particularly Hanger Lane station not far to the west). The entrance to a &#x27;North London Line&#x27; North Acton station could be just a few metres on the other side of Victoria Road from the current North Acton station eastern entrance. There is a footpath to the west immediately next to the railway, from nearby Chase Road to Park Royal Road.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 95, 218, 260, 266, 440, 487 and N266 serve the station.

<text>Aotea Harbour () is a settlement and smallest of three large natural inlets in the Tasman Sea coast of the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located between Raglan Harbour to the north and Kawhia Harbour to the south, 30 kilometres southwest of Hamilton.

== Geography ==
Aotea Harbour is a drowned valley system following the post glacial Aranuian sea level rise of over 100m in the last 14,000 years, but its level may also be influenced by the Makomako and Te Maari faults. It has a high-tide area of and a low-tide area of .

Most higher ground around the harbour is formed from Jurassic era graywacke stone, while the Aotea Harbour north head were formed from Quaternary marine deposits, wind blown north-east from the Tasman Sea.

54% of the area around the harbour is in sheep and beef grazing. Since 1850 native forest cover has declined from 98% to 28%, about 18% managed by the Department of Conservation.

Waireinga/Bridal Veil Falls is located on Pakoka River, and Lake Disappear is on Pakihi Stream, both of which flow into Aotea Harbour.

=== Wildlife ===
Most of the land surrounding the Aotea Harbour is grassland with occasional pōhutukawa trees; however, archaeological charcoal evidence shows the presence of some tawa, rimu and kanuka trees, alongside &quot;Hebe&quot; and &quot;Coprosma&quot; shrubs. In the present day, some common plants found around the harbour are &quot;Cotula coronopifolia&quot;, &quot;Sarcocornia quinqueflora&quot;, &quot;Avicennia marina&quot;, &quot;Apodasmia similis&quot;, &quot;Selliera radicans&quot;, &quot;Plagianthus divaricatus&quot;, &quot;Paspalum vaginatum&quot;, &quot;Samolus repens&quot;, &quot;Juncus kraussii&quot;, &quot;Zostera novazelandica, Austrostipa stipoides, Isolepis cernua, Spartina anglica, Schoenoplectus pungens, Baumea juncea, Cordyline australis, Olearia solandri, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Leptospermum scoparium&quot;, &quot;Bolboschoenus fluviatilis&quot;, &quot;Coprosma propinqua&quot;, &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot;, &quot;Cortaderia jubata&quot; and &quot;Typha orientalis&quot;.

Birds recorded in the harbour include white faced heron, South Island oyster catcher, godwit, pied stilt, black backed gull, red billed gull, swan, Canada goose, spur-winged plover, New Zealand dotterel, Royal spoonbill, kingfisher, pied shag, fernbird, paradise duck, Caspian tern, white-fronted tern and gannet.

The commonest fish species in the harbour are anchovy, flounder and yellow-eyed mullet. Shellfish species found in the harbour include Pipi and cockles.

Orca, bottlenose and common dolphin occasionally enter the harbour.

== History ==

According to traditional history, the harbour is the final landing place for the &quot;Aotea&quot; waka. Migrants from the Aotea waka are said to have brought karaka trees to the area when they settled. People aboard the &quot;&#x27;Tainui&quot; waka settled around the Aotea Harbour, Kawhia Harbour and Whaingaroa Harbour (Raglan Harbour) in approximately 1350. Over 100 Māori archaeological sites are found around the harbour, dating to the 15th and 16th centuries. Many found on the Aotea Harbour north head, such as Koreromaiwaho Paa, were covered with Aeolian sand, blown due to the prevailing south-westerly wind. The people who settled around Aotea Harbour traditionally cultivated kumara, while collecting tuatua from the Tasman Sea, and pipi and cockles from the harbour. The harbour was the site of a seven generational war between Ngāti Māhanga and Ngāti Tū-irirangi.

By the early 1800s, the Aotea Harbour area had been settled by Tainui iwi including Ngāti Māhanga, Ngāti Te Wehi, Ngāti Mahuta, Ngāti Koata and Ngāti Toa. Conflict between Tainui iwi led by Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Ngāti Toa, led to Ngāti Toa settling Kapiti Island and the Kāpiti Coast in the 1820s, while their allies, the Ngāti Koata, settled around the northern shore of the South Island (in the Tasman, Nelson and Marlborough regions). In the 1880s described as the north-western edge of the Te Rohe Pōtae (King Country lands).

==Marae==

Several Waikato Tainui marae are located around Aotea Harbour. Te Tihi o Moerangi Marae and meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Te Weehi. Mōtakotako Marae and Te Ōhākī a Mahuta meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Mahuta, Ngāti Te Weehi and Tainui Hapū. Te Papatapu or Te Wehi Marae and Pare Whakarukuruku meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Te Weehi.

== Demographics ==
The meshblocks around the edge of the harbour had these census results -
The population was once much larger. For example, about 200 lived at Makaka in 1880.

== Roads ==
The harbour has few roads giving access to it. Aotea village and Okapu have a road linked to SH31, near Kawhia. A gravel road links SH31 to Makomako. Just north of Makomako, at Maari Stream, two roads link to Te Mata; Te Papatapu Rd follows the edge of the harbour for over . Kawhia Rd runs east via Lake Disappear and Waireinga/Bridal Veil Falls. Phillips Rd branches from Te Papatapu Rd, giving access to some areas north of the harbour.

The beaches were initially a main route and were linked by boat across the harbour entrance.

About 1880 Te Papatapu Rd was built from Te Mata, but from Te Papatapu the route was across the harbour at low tide.

The bridges over the Maari and Makomako streams were built about 1918, though the road linking Kawhia and Te Mata was not usable until about 1926. They were replaced by concrete bridges in 1970.

When Makomako School was built in 1925, timber and other supplies were taken by road to Pakoka landing, but then rafted across the harbour and up the stream to a point near the school.

The roads were metalled in the 1930s.

From 1938 to 1952 public buses linked Kawhia and Raglan.

== Education ==
Makomako School was just above the junction of Makomako Road and the Te Mata-Kawhia Road. It was open from 26 October 1925 (with an initial roll of 31 girls and 16 boys) to 1981, or 1983. Makomako and the area north of it are now in the catchment area for Te Mata School, though the school buses only reach to Te Papatapu Road.

From 1899 to 1904 there was a school at Raoraokauere mission station.

<text>East Acton is a London Underground station in East Acton in London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The station is on the Central line, between White City and North Acton stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. Wormwood Scrubs, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, Wormwood Scrubs prison and Imperial College Hammersmith branch are accessible from the station.

==Location==
The station is located on Erconwald Street and is near the A40 Western Avenue connected via Old Oak Common Lane, from the centre of East Acton. Wormwood Scrubs, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs and Imperial College Hammersmith branch are accessible from the station.

==History==

In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) proposal to construct the Ealing &amp; Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Railway (E&amp;SBR) so that it would connect its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush was approved by Parliament. Construction had not started and in 1911, the Central London Railway (CLR, now part of the Central line) and GWR agreed running powers for CLR services to continue from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Ealing Broadway using the GWR route. The CLR request for a short extension from Wood Lane to connect to the E&amp;SBR tracks gained parliamentary approval on 18 August 1911 under the &quot;Central London Railway Act, 1911&quot;. The GWR constructed the new E&amp;SBR line. Electrification of the track did not begin until after the end of the First World War. When complete, CLR services started on 1920 where East Acton was opened as the only intermediate station.

Since the CLR was exclusively a passenger service, two extra dedicated tracks for the GWR&#x27;s freight trains were opened in 1938, but were closed in 1964. The trackbed of these rails is now overgrown with vegetation, visible immediately to the north of the station.

===Improvements and closures===
The tracks at East Acton were replaced in 2005 which saw a partial closure of the line from West Ruislip or Ealing Broadway to White City between 13 and 14 August 2005. In 2007, the station was refurbished by Metronet.

From August 2021, the eastbound platform was rebuilt. During the works eastbound Central line trains (towards central London) and all Night Tube trains did not stop at East Acton. Originally planned to last five months until December 2021, it was discovered that structural elements required full replacement rather than repair and the platforms did not reopen until 19 September 2022.

==Services and connections==
===Services===
East Acton is served by the Central line between North Acton and White City. To the east, the two tracks change direction to continue to White City.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*9 tph eastbound to Epping
*3 tph eastbound to Loughton
*6 tph eastbound to Hainault via Newbury Park
*3 tph eastbound to Woodford via Hainault
*9 tph westbound to West Ruislip
*3 tph westbound to Northolt
*9 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway

Night Tube services also serve the station, with a frequency of 3 tph in both directions.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 7, 70, 72, 95, 228, 260, 272 and 283, and Night Bus route N7 serve the station.

<doc id="1185476" wikidata="Q2081020" url="?curid=1185476" title="Neatsfoot oil">
<text>Neatsfoot oil is a yellow oil rendered and purified from the shin bones and feet (but not the hooves) of cattle. &quot;Neat&quot; in the oil&#x27;s name comes from an Old English word for cattle. Neatsfoot oil is used as a conditioning, softening and preservative agent for leather. In the 18th century, it was also used medicinally as a topical application for dry scaly skin conditions.

In spite of its name, &quot;prime neatsfoot oil&quot; (or &quot;neatsfoot oil compound&quot;) is a blend of actual neatsfoot oil and non-animal oils, generally mineral or other petroleum-based oils.

== Characteristics ==
Fat from warm-blooded animals normally has a high melting point, becoming hard when cool, but neatsfoot oil remains liquid at room temperature. This is because the relatively slender legs and feet of animals such as cattle are adapted to tolerate and maintain much lower temperatures than that of the body core, using countercurrent heat exchange in the legs between warm arterial and cooler venous blood. Other body fat would become stiff at these temperatures. This characteristic of neatsfoot oil allows it to soak easily into leather.

Modern neatsfoot oil is still made from cattle-based products, and is sometimes criticized for a tendency to oxidize and therefore contribute to the deterioration of leather. This formulation does darken leather, particularly lighter shades. If mineral oil or other petroleum-based material is added, the product may be called &quot;neatsfoot oil compound&quot;. Some brands have also been shown to be adulterated with rapeseed oil, soya oil, and other oils. The addition of mineral oils may lead to more rapid decay of non-synthetic stitching or speed breakdown of the leather itself.

==Manufacture==
The lower legs of slaughtered cattle (less the hooves) are boiled, skin and all. The fat that is released (as an oil) is skimmed off, filtered, and pressed. The first pressing is the highest grade; the second produces both a lower grade and a solid press cake or stearin product used, among other things, to make soap.

== Uses ==
Neatsfoot oil is used to soften, condition, and preserve a number of leather products, including baseball gloves and horse tack, including saddles and harnesses. It is being displaced by synthetic products in certain applications. 

Like other leather dressings, neatsfoot oil can oxidize with time and contribute to embrittling, especially on historical objects. It also may leave an oily residue that can attract dust.

Neatsfoot oil of the highest grade is used as a lubricant. It is used in metalworking industries as a cutting fluid for aluminium. For machining, tapping and drilling aluminium, it is superior to kerosene and various water-based cutting fluids. 

Neatsfoot oil is often used to oil sign-writers&#x27; brushes that have been used in oil-based paint, as this oil is non drying and can be easily washed out with solvent at any time. Oiling the brushes reduces the buildup of pigment in the ferrule, the metal part that many brushes have to hold the hairs in place.

<doc id="1185479" wikidata="Q155833" url="?curid=1185479" title="Nerium">
<text>Nerium oleander ( ), commonly known as oleander or rosebay, is a shrub or small tree cultivated worldwide in temperate and subtropical areas as an ornamental and landscaping plant. It is the only species currently classified in the genus Nerium, belonging to subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. It is so widely cultivated that no precise region of origin has been identified, though it is usually associated with the Mediterranean Basin.

Nerium grows to tall. It is most commonly grown in its natural shrub form, but can be trained into a small tree with a single trunk. It is tolerant to both drought and inundation, but not to prolonged frost. White, pink or red five-lobed flowers grow in clusters year-round, peaking during the summer. The fruit is a long narrow pair of follicles, which splits open at maturity to release numerous downy seeds.

Nerium is a poisonous plant but its bitterness renders it unpalatable to humans and most animals, so poisoning cases are rare and the general risk for human mortality is low. Ingestion of larger amounts may cause nausea, vomiting, excess salivation, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and irregular heart rhythm. Prolonged contact with sap may cause skin irritation, eye inflammation and dermatitis.

==Description==

Oleander grows to tall, with erect stems that splay outward as they mature; first-year stems have a glaucous bloom, while mature stems have a grayish bark. The leaves are in pairs or whorls of three, thick and leathery, dark-green, narrow lanceolate, long and broad, and with an entire margin filled with minute reticulate venation web typical of eudicots. The leaves are light green and very glossy when young, maturing to a dull dark green.

The flowers grow in clusters at the end of each branch; they are white, pink to red, diameter, with a deeply 5-lobed fringed corolla round the central corolla tube. They are often, but not always, sweet-scented. The fruit is a long narrow pair of follicles long, which splits open at maturity to release numerous downy seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Nerium oleander&quot; is the only species currently classified in the genus Nerium. It belongs to (and gives its name to) the small tribe Nerieae of subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. The genera most closely related thus include the equally ornamental (and equally toxic) &quot;Adenium&quot; and &quot;Strophanthus&quot; - both of which contain (like oleander) potent cardiac glycosides that have led to their use as arrow poisons in Africa. The three remaining genera &quot;Alafia&quot; , &quot;Farquharia&quot; and &quot;Isonema&quot; are less well-known in cultivation.

*&quot;Oleander indica&quot; 
*&quot;Oleander vulgaris&quot; 
=== Etymology ===
The taxonomic name &quot;Nerium oleander&quot; was first assigned by Linnaeus in 1753. The genus name &quot;Nerium&quot; is the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek name for the plant &quot;nẽrion&quot; (νήριον), which is in turn derived from the Greek for water, &quot;nẽros&quot; (νηρός), because of the natural habitat of the oleander along rivers and streams.

The origins of the species name are disputed. The word &quot;oleander&quot; appears as far back as the first century AD, when the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides cited it as one of the terms used by the Romans for the plant. Merriam-Webster believes the word is a Medieval Latin corruption of Late Latin names for the plant: &quot;arodandrum&quot; or &quot;lorandrum&quot;, or more plausibly &quot;rhododendron&quot; (another Ancient Greek name for the plant), with the addition of &quot;olea&quot; because of the superficial resemblance to the olive tree (&quot;Olea europea&quot;) Another theory posited is that &quot;oleander&quot; is the Latinized form of a Greek compound noun: &quot;οllyo&quot; (ὀλλύω) &#x27;I kill&#x27;, and the Greek noun for man, &quot;aner&quot;, genitive &quot;andros&quot; (ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός). ascribed to oleander&#x27;s toxicity to humans.

The etymological association of &quot;oleander&quot; with the bay laurel has continued into the modern day: in France the plant is known as &quot;laurier rose&quot;, while the Spanish term, &quot;Adelfa&quot;, is the descendant of the original Ancient Greek name for both the bay laurel and the oleander, &quot;daphne&quot;, which subsequently passed into Arabic usage and thence to Spain.

The ancient city of Volubilis in Morocco may have taken its name from the Berber name &quot;alili&quot; or &quot;oualilt&quot; for the flower.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Nerium oleander&quot; is either native or naturalized to a broad area spanning from Northwest Africa and Iberian and Italian Peninsula eastward through the Mediterranean region and warmer areas of the Black Sea region, Arabian Peninsula, southern Asia, and as far east as Yunnan in southern parts of China. It typically occurs around stream beds in river valleys, where it can alternatively tolerate long seasons of drought and inundation from winter rains. &quot;N. oleander&quot; is planted in many subtropical and tropical areas of the world.

On the East Coast of the US, it grows as far north as Virginia Beach, while in California and Texas miles of oleander shrubs are planted on median strips. There are estimated to be 25 million oleanders planted along highways and roadsides throughout the state of California. Because of its durability, oleander was planted prolifically on Galveston Island in Texas after the disastrous Hurricane of 1900. They are so prolific that Galveston is known as the &#x27;Oleander City&#x27;; an annual oleander festival is hosted every spring. Moody Gardens in Galveston hosts the propagation program for the International Oleander Society, which promotes the cultivation of oleanders. New varieties are hybridized and grown on the Moody Gardens grounds, encompassing every named variety.

Beyond the traditional Mediterranean and subtropical range of oleander, the plant can also be cultivated in mild oceanic climates with the appropriate precautions. It is grown without protection in warmer areas in Switzerland, southern and western Germany and southern England and can reach great sizes in London and to a lesser extent in Paris due to the urban heat island effect. This is also the case with North American cities in the Pacific Northwest like Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver. Plants may suffer damage or die back in such marginal climates during severe winter cold but will rebound from the roots.

==Ecology==
Some invertebrates are known to be unaffected by oleander toxins, and feed on the plants. Caterpillars of the polka-dot wasp moth (&quot;Syntomeida epilais&quot;) feed specifically on oleanders and survive by eating only the pulp surrounding the leaf-veins, avoiding the fibers. Larvae of the common crow butterfly (&quot;Euploea core&quot;) and oleander hawk-moth (&quot;Daphnis nerii&quot;) also feed on oleanders, and they retain or modify toxins, making them unpalatable to potential predators such as birds, but not to other invertebrates such as spiders and wasps.

The flowers require insect visits to set seed, and seem to be pollinated through a deception mechanism. The showy corolla acts as a potent advertisement to attract pollinators from a distance, but the flowers are nectarless and offer no reward to their visitors. They therefore receive very few visits, as typical of many rewardless flower species. Fears of honey contamination with toxic oleander nectar are therefore unsubstantiated.

===Leaf scorch===

A bacterial disease known as (&quot;Xylella fastidiosa&quot; subspecies &quot;sandyi&quot;) has become a serious threat to the shrub since it was first noticed in Palm Springs, California, in 1992. The disease has since devastated hundreds of thousands of shrubs mainly in Southern California, but also on a smaller scale in Arizona, Nevada and Texas. The culprit is a bacterium which is spread via insects (the glassy-winged sharpshooter primarily) which feed on the tissue of oleanders and spread the bacteria. This inhibits the circulation of water in the tissue of the plant, causing individual branches to die until the entire plant is consumed.

Symptoms of leaf scorch infection may be slow to manifest themselves, but it becomes evident when parts of otherwise healthy oleanders begin to yellow and wither, as if scorched by heat or fire. Die-back may cease during winter dormancy, but the disease flares up in summer heat while the shrub is actively growing, which allows the bacteria to spread through the xylem of the plant. As such it can be difficult to identify at first because gardeners may mistake the symptoms for those of drought stress or nutrient deficiency.

Pruning out affected parts can slow the progression of the disease but not eliminate it. This malaise can continue for several years until the plant completely dies—there is no known cure. The best method for preventing further spread of the disease is to prune infected oleanders to the ground immediately after the infection is noticed.

The responsible pathogen was identified as the subspecies &quot;sandyi&quot; by Purcell &quot;et al.&quot;, 1999.

== Cultivation ==
===History===

&quot;Nerium oleander&quot; has a history of cultivation going back millennia, especially amongst the great ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean Basin. Some scholars believe it to be the &quot;rhodon&quot; (rose), also called the &#x27;Rose of Jericho&#x27;, mentioned in apocryphal writings (Ecclesiasticus XXIV, 13) dating back to between 450 and 180 BC.

The ancient Greeks had several names for the plant, including &quot;rhododaphne&quot;, &quot;nerion&quot;, &quot;rhododendron&quot; and &quot;rhodon&quot;. Pliny confirmed that the Romans had no Latin word for the plant, but used the Greek terms instead. Pedanius Dioscorides states in his 1st century AD pharmacopeia &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; that the Romans used the Greek &quot;rhododendron&quot; but also the Latin &quot;Oleander&quot; and &quot;Laurorosa&quot;. The Egyptians apparently called it &quot;scinphe&quot;, the North Africans &quot;rhodedaphane&quot;, and the Lucanians (a southern Italic people) &quot;icmane&quot;.

Both Pliny and Dioscorides stated that oleander was an effective antidote to venomous snake bites if mixed with rue and drunk. However, both rue and oleander are poisonous themselves, and consuming them after a venomous snake bite can accelerate the rate of mortality and increase fatalities.

A 2014 article in the medical journal &quot;Perspectives in Biology and Medicine&quot; posited that oleander was the substance used to induce hallucinations in the Pythia, the female priestess of Apollo, also known as the Oracle of Delphi in Ancient Greece. According to this theory, the symptoms of the Pythia&#x27;s trances (&quot;enthusiasmos&quot;) correspond to either inhaling the smoke of or chewing small amounts of oleander leaves, often called by the generic term &quot;laurel&quot; in Ancient Greece, which led to confusion with the bay laurel that ancient authors cite.

In his book &quot;Enquiries into Plants&quot; of circa 300 BC, Theophrastus described (among plants that affect the mind) a shrub he called &quot;onotheras&quot;, which modern editors render oleander: &quot;the root of &quot;onotheras&quot; [oleander] administered in wine&quot;, he alleges, has a beneficial effect on mood:

The root of &quot;onotheras&quot; [oleander] administered in wine makes the temper gentler and more cheerful. The plant has a leaf like that of the almond, but smaller, and the flower is red like a rose. The plant itself (which loves hilly country) forms a large bush; the root is red and large, and, if this is dried, it gives off a fragrance like wine.

In another mention, of &quot;wild bay&quot; (&quot;Daphne agria&quot;), Theophrastus appears to intend the same shrub.

Oleander was a very popular ornamental shrub in Roman peristyle gardens; it is one of the flora most frequently depicted on murals in Pompeii and elsewhere in Italy. These murals include the famous garden scene from the House of Livia at Prima Porta outside Rome, and those from the House of the Wedding of Alexander and the Marine Venus in Pompeii.

Carbonized fragments of oleander wood have been identified at the Villa Poppaea in Oplontis, likewise buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. They were found to have been planted in a decorative arrangement with citron trees (&quot;Citrus medica&quot;) alongside the villa&#x27;s swimming pool.

Herbaria of oleander varieties are compiled and held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and at Moody Gardens in Galveston, Texas.

=== Ornamental gardening ===

Oleander is a vigorous grower in warm subtropical regions, where it is extensively used as an ornamental plant in parks, along roadsides and in private gardens. It is most commonly grown in its natural shrub form, but can be trained into a small tree with a single trunk. Hardy versions like white, red and pink oleander will tolerate occasional light frost down to , though the leaves may be damaged. The toxicity of oleander renders it deer-resistant and its large size makes for a good windbreak – as such it is frequently planted as a hedge along property lines and in agricultural settings.

The plant is tolerant of poor soils, intense heat, salt spray, and sustained drought – although it will flower and grow more vigorously with regular water. Although it does not require pruning to thrive and bloom, oleander can become unruly with age and older branches tend to become gangly, with new growth emerging from the base. For this reason gardeners are advised to prune mature shrubs in the autumn to shape and induce lush new growth and flowering for the following spring. Unless they wish to harvest the seeds, many gardeners choose to prune away the seedpods that form on spent flower clusters, which are a drain on energy. Propagation can be made from cuttings, where they can readily root after being placed in water or in rich organic potting material, like compost.

In Mediterranean climates oleanders can be expected to bloom from April through October, with the heaviest bloom usually occurring between May and June. Free-flowering varieties like &#x27;Petite Salmon&#x27; or &#x27;Mont Blanc&#x27; require no period of rest and can flower continuously throughout the year if the weather remains warm.

In cold winter climates, oleander is a popular summer potted plant readily available at most nurseries. They require frequent heavy watering and fertilizing as compared to being planted in the ground, but oleander is nonetheless an ideal flowering shrub for patios and other spaces with hot sunshine. During the winter they should be moved indoors, ideally into an unheated greenhouse or basement where they can be allowed to go dormant. Once they are dormant they require little light and only occasional watering. Placing them in a space with central heating and poor air flow can make them susceptible to a variety of pests – aphids, mealybugs, oleander scale, whitefly and spider mites.

==== Colors and varieties ====
Oleander flowers are showy, profuse, and often fragrant, which makes them very attractive in many contexts. Over 400 cultivars have been named, with several additional flower colors not found in wild plants having been selected, including yellow, peach and salmon. Many cultivars, like &#x27;Hawaii&#x27; or &#x27;Turner&#x27;s Carnival&#x27;, are multi-colored, with brilliant striped corollas. The solid whites, reds and a variety of pinks are the most common. Double flowered cultivars like &#x27;Mrs. Isadore Dyer&#x27; (deep pink), &#x27;Mathilde Ferrier&#x27; (yellow) or &#x27;Mont Blanc&#x27; (white) are enjoyed for their large, rose-like blooms and strong fragrance. There is also a variegated form, &#x27;Variegata&#x27;, featuring leaves striped in yellow and white. Several dwarf cultivars have also been developed, offering a more compact form and size for small spaces. These include &#x27;Little Red&#x27;, &#x27;Petite White&#x27;, &#x27;Petite Pink&#x27; and &#x27;Petite Salmon&#x27;, which grow to about at maturity.

== Toxicity ==
Oleander is a poisonous plant because of toxic compounds it contains, especially when consumed in large amounts. Among these compounds are oleandrin and oleandrigenin, known as cardiac glycosides, which are known to have a narrow therapeutic index and are toxic when ingested. Side effects after ingestion are weakness, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach pain, and death. 

Toxicity studies of animals concluded that birds and rodents were observed to be relatively insensitive to the administered oleander cardiac glycosides. Other mammals, however, such as dogs and humans, are relatively sensitive to the effects of cardiac glycosides and the clinical manifestations of &quot;glycoside intoxication&quot;.

It is also hazardous to animals such as sheep, horses, cattle, and other grazing animals, with as little as 100 g being enough to kill an adult horse. Plant clippings are especially dangerous to horses, as they are sweet. In July 2009, several horses were poisoned in this manner from the leaves of the plant. Symptoms of a poisoned horse include severe diarrhea and abnormal heartbeat. This is aptly reflected in the plant&#x27;s Sanskrit name &quot;aśvamāra&quot; (अश्वमार), a compound of &quot;aśva&quot; &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;māra&quot; &quot;killing&quot;.

In reviewing oleander toxicity cases seen in-hospital, Lanford and Boor concluded that, except for children who might be at greater risk, &quot;the human mortality associated with oleander ingestion is generally very low, even in cases of moderate intentional consumption (suicide attempts).&quot; In 2000, a rare instance of death from oleander poisoning occurred when two toddlers adopted from an orphanage ate the leaves from a neighbor&#x27;s shrub in El Segundo, California. Because oleander is extremely bitter, officials speculated that the toddlers had developed a condition caused by malnutrition, pica, which causes people to eat otherwise inedible material.

=== Effects of poisoning ===
Ingestion of this plant can affect the gastrointestinal system, the heart, and the central nervous system. The main effect of cardiotoxic glycosides is positive inotropy. Glycosides bind to the sarcolemma transmembrane ATP of cardiac muscle cells and compete with K+ ions, inactivating the enzyme. This results in an accumulation of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cardiac muscle cells, leading to stronger and faster heart contractions. Moreover, the increased amount of extracellular K+ ions may lead to lethal hyperkalemia. Therefore, clinical features of oleander poisoning are similar to digoxin toxicity and include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting due to stimulation of the area postrema of the medulla oblongata, neuropsychic disorders, and pathological motor manifestations. Cardiotoxic glycosides are also responsible for stimulating the vagus nerve (leading to sinus bradycardia) and the phrenic nerve (leading to hyperventilation), and lethal brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including asystole and ventricular fibrillation. Oleander poisoning can also result in blurred vision, and vision disturbances, including halos appearing around objects. Oleander sap can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergic reactions characterized by dermatitis.

The severity of the intoxication can vary based on the quantity ingested and an individual&#x27;s physiological response, as well as the time of symptom onset after oleander ingestion: they can rapidly occur after drinking teas prepared with oleander leaves or roots or develop more slowly due to the ingestion of unprepared plant parts.

=== Treatment ===

Poisoning and reactions to oleander plants are evident quickly, requiring immediate medical care in suspected or known poisonings of both humans and animals. Induced vomiting and gastric lavage are protective measures to reduce absorption of the toxic compounds. Activated carbon may also be administered to help absorb any remaining toxins. Further medical attention may be required depending on the severity of the poisoning and symptoms. Temporary cardiac pacing will be required in many cases (usually for a few days) until the toxin is excreted.

Digoxin immune fab is the best way to cure an oleander poisoning if inducing vomiting has no or minimal success, although it is usually used only for life-threatening conditions due to side effects.

Drying of plant materials does not eliminate the toxins. There is a wide range of toxins and secondary compounds within oleander, and care should be taken around this plant due to its toxic nature. Different names for oleander are used around the world in different locations, so, when encountering a plant with this appearance, regardless of the name used for it, one should exercise great care and caution to avoid ingestion of any part of the plant, including its sap and dried leaves or twigs. The dried or fresh branches should not be used for spearing food, for preparing a cooking fire, or as a food skewer. Many of the oleander relatives, such as the desert rose (&quot;Adenium obesum&quot;) found in East Africa, have similar leaves and flowers and are equally toxic.

== Research ==
Drugs derived from &quot;N. oleander&quot; have been investigated as a treatment for cancer, but have failed to demonstrate clinical utility. According to the American Cancer Society, the trials conducted so far have produced no evidence of benefit, while they did cause adverse side effects.

==Culture==

=== Oracle of Delphi ===
In a research study done by Haralampos V. Harissis, he claims that the laurel the Pythia is commonly depicted with is actually an oleander plant, and the poisonous plant and its subsequent hallucinations are the source of the oracle&#x27;s mystical power and subsequent prophecies. Many of the symptoms that primary sources such as Plutarch and Democritus report align with results of oleander poisoning. Harissis also provides evidence claiming that the word laurel may have been used to describe an oleander leaf.

=== Folklore ===
The toxicity of the plant makes it the center of an urban legend documented on several continents and over more than a century. Often told as a true and local event, typically an entire family, or in other tellings a group of scouts, succumbs after consuming hot dogs or other food roasted over a campfire using oleander sticks. Some variants tell of this happening to Napoleon&#x27;s or Alexander the Great&#x27;s soldiers.

There is an ancient account mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, who described a region in Pontus in Turkey where the honey was poisoned from bees having pollinated poisonous flowers, with the honey left as a poisonous trap for an invading army. The flowers have sometimes been mis-translated as oleander, but oleander flowers are nectarless and therefore cannot transmit any toxins via nectar. The actual flower referenced by Pliny was either Azalea or &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, which is still used in Turkey to produce a hallucinogenic honey.

Oleander is the official flower of the city of Hiroshima, having been the first to bloom following the atomic bombing of the city in 1945.

=== In painting ===
Oleander was part of subject matter of paintings by famous artists including:
* Gustav Klimt, who painted &quot;Two Girls with an Oleander&quot; between 1890 and 1892.
* Vincent van Gogh painted his famous &quot;Oleanders&quot; in Arles in 1888. Van Gogh found the flowers &quot;joyous&quot; and &quot;life-affirming&quot; because of their inexhaustible blooms and vigour.
* Anglo-Dutch artist Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema incorporated oleanders into his classically inspired paintings, including &quot;An Oleander&quot; (1882), &quot;Courtship&quot;, &quot;Under the Roof of Blue Ionian Weather&quot; and &quot;A Roman Flower Market&quot; (1868).
* &quot;The Terrace at Méric (Oleanders)&quot;, an 1867 Impressionist painting by Frédéric Bazille.

=== In literature, film and music ===
* Janet Fitch&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;White Oleander&quot; is centered around a young Southern California girl&#x27;s experiences growing up in foster care after her mother is imprisoned for poisoning an ex-boyfriend with the plant. The book was adapted into a 2002 film of the same name starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Alison Lohman.
* In the 17th century AD Farsi-language book the &quot;Jahangirnama&quot;, the Mughal emperor Jahangir passes a stream overgrowing with oleanders along its banks. He orders the nobles in his train to adorn their turbans with oleander blossoms, creating a &quot;field of flowers&quot; on their heads.
* Steely Dan&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;My Old School&quot; contains the line &quot;Oleanders growing outside her door, soon they&#x27;re gonna be in bloom up in Annandale&quot; in the second verse. It has been theorized that this reference is either a metaphor for a harmful relationship, or marijuana, which is the subcontext of the song.

<doc id="1185486" wikidata="Q838734" url="?curid=1185486" title="Kawhia Harbour">
<text>Kawhia Harbour () is one of three large natural inlets in the Tasman Sea coast of the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located to the south of Raglan Harbour, Ruapuke and Aotea Harbour, 40 kilometres southwest of Hamilton. Kawhia is part of the Ōtorohanga District and is in the King Country. It has a high-tide area of and a low-tide area of . Te Motu Island is located in the harbour.

The settlement of Kawhia is located on the northern coast of the inlet, and was an important port in early colonial New Zealand. The area of Kawhia comprises and is the town block that was owned by the New Zealand Government. The government bought it from the Europeans in 1880 &quot;not from the original Māori owners, but from a European who claimed ownership in payment of money owed by another European&quot;.

== History and culture ==

===Early history===

Kawhia Harbour is the southernmost location where kauri trees historically grew.

Kawhia is known in Māori lore as the final resting-place of the ancestral waka (canoe) &quot;Tainui&quot;. Soon after arrival, captain Hoturoa made it first priority to establish a whare wananga (sacred school of learning) which was named Ahurei. Ahurei is situated at the summit of the sacred hill behind Kawhia’s seaside marae – Maketu Marae. The harbour area was the birthplace of the prominent Māori warrior chief Te Rauparaha of the Ngāti Toa tribe, who lived in the area until the 1820s, when he, and his tribe along with Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Koata migrated southwards.

Tainui was buried at the base of Ahurei by Hoturoa himself, and other members of the iwi. Hoturoa marked out the waka with two limestone pillars, which he blessed. Firstly, there is &quot;Hani (Hani-a-te-waewae-i-kimi-atu) which is on the higher ground and marked the prow of the canoe&quot;. Marking the stern of the canoe, Hoturoa placed the symbol of Puna, the spirit-goddess of that creation story. &quot;In full it is named Puna-whakatupu-tangata, and represents female fertility, the spring or source of humanity&quot;. It is said that a pure woman who touches this stone will be given the gift of a child, and become pregnant. There have been cases of women using Puna when they have had difficulty conceiving a child.

===Marae===

Maketu Marae is located next to Kawhia Harbour. The main meeting house of the marae, Auau ki te Rangi, is named after Hoturoa’s father, who was a high chief (ariki) and was built and opened in 1962.

The eldest and most prestigious meeting house that was first built on Maketu Marae is Te Ruruhi (the Old Lady) which was used as the dining hall until 1986. It was replaced by a two-storey dining hall, Te Tini O Tainui, to cater for the large numbers that visit for occasions such as annual poukai, tangi and hui. The marae is affiliated to Waikato through the hapū of Ngāti Mahuta, with connections to Ngāti Apakura, Ngāti Hikairo, and Ngāti Te Wehi.

Six other marae are also based at or near Kawhia Harbour:
* Mōkai Kainga Marae and Ko Te Mōkai meeting house is a meeting place for the Ngāti Maniapoto hapū of Apakura and Hikairo, and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Apakura.
* Mokoroa Marae and Ngā Roimata meeting house is a meeting place for the Waikato hapū of Ngati Kiriwai.
* Ōkapu or Oakapu Marae and Te Kotahitanga o Ngāti Te Wehi meeting house is a meeting place for the Waikato hapū of Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Te Wehi.
* Te Māhoe Marae is a meeting ground for the Ngāti Maniapoto hapū of Peehi, Te Kanawa, Te Urupare and Uekaha.
* Waipapa Marae and Ngā Tai Whakarongorua and Takuhiahia meeting houses are a meeting place for the Ngāti Maniapoto hapū of Hikairo, and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Hikairo and Ngāti Puhiawe.
*Rākaunui Marae and Moana Kahakore meeting house is on Ngati Tamainu (Waikato) land, the hapu of whichu are Ngāti Te Kiriwai, Ngati Huiarangi, Ngati Te Kanawa, and Ngati Mahuta). It also affiliates to Ngāti Ngutu, Ngāti Paretekawa of Maniapoto, and Ngāti Apakura.

In October 2020, the Government committed $196,684 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Ōkapu Marae, creating 16 jobs.

=== European history ===

The Kawhia Harbour area was important to the kauri gum trade of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, as it was the southernmost area where the gum could be found.

The Kawhia Settler and Raglan Advertiser was established in May 1901 by William Murray Thompson and Thomas Elliott Wilson, who also ran the Bruce Herald, Waimate Times, Egmont Settler (later briefly part of Taranaki Central Press at Stratford) and the Mangaweka Settler. From 1909 Edward Henry Schnackenberg, whose father was a missionary here from 1858 to 1864, owned the paper, until it closed in April 1936.

In January 2018, the health board issued a statement that there was no additional risk from tuberculosis in Kawhia after reports of three possible cases.

<doc id="1185497" wikidata="Q973774" url="?curid=1185497" title="Connie Mack IV">
<text>Cornelius Harvey McGillicuddy IV (born August 12, 1967), known popularly as Connie Mack IV, is an American politician and lobbyist. He is the former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2005 to 2013. A Republican, he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012, losing to Democrat Bill Nelson. He is the son of former Republican U.S. Senator Connie Mack III and the great-grandson of baseball manager Connie Mack.

==Early life, education, and family==
Mack was born in Fort Myers, Florida, the son of former U.S. Senator Connie Mack III and cancer prevention advocate Ludie Priscilla (née Hobbs). His father represented the district from 1983 to 1989 (when it was numbered as the 13th District), before serving two terms in the U.S. Senate.

Through his father, Mack is the great-grandson of Cornelius McGillicuddy (&quot;Connie Mack&quot;), the manager and owner of baseball&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame; the great-grandson of Morris Sheppard, U.S. Senator and Representative from Texas; and the great-great-grandson of John Levi Sheppard, a U.S. Representative from Texas.

In June 1988, Mack earned his Associate of Arts from Santa Fe Community College and In 1993, Mack earned his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Florida. After college, Mack became a marketing executive, working as a consultant to promote the restaurant chain Hooters.

==Florida House of Representatives==
In 2000, incumbent Republican State Representative Debby Sanderson decided to retire to run for a seat in the Florida Senate. Mack decided to run for the open seat in the Fort Lauderdale–based 91st House District. He defeated Democratic nominee Kevin Rader 56%–44%. In 2002, he won re-election with 79% of the vote.

Mack was Chairman of the Committee on State Administration, and in his second term he became the Deputy Majority Leader.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2003, incumbent Republican Congressman Porter Goss announced his intention to retire in order to serve as Director of the CIA. That October, Mack resigned from the Florida Legislature and moved back to his hometown of Fort Myers to run for his father&#x27;s old seat. Had he not resigned his state house seat, he would have been unable to vote for himself in the primary or general election in the 14th District, as the Florida Constitution requires state legislators to be residents of the district they represent. Mack stated, &quot;The people of the 14th District deserve to be represented in Washington by someone who shares our mainstream conservative Republican values in the mold of my father and Congressman Porter Goss&quot;. He narrowly won a four-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—with a plurality of 36% of the vote, defeating more experienced challengers State Representative Carole Green and Lee County Commissioner Andy Coy. He won the general election with 68% of the vote.

Mack consistently won re-election without serious difficulty, with his closest bid in 2008, when he won 59% in a three-way election.

===Tenure===
Mack is a vocal supporter of cutting federal spending and lower taxes. He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Additionally, he is a co-sponsor of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget and was one of the most outspoken opponents of federal bailouts. Mack has also been a prominent advocate for greater congressional oversight of government surveillance. He voted against George W. Bush&#x27;s domestic eavesdropping program in 2006 and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Reform in 2007.

Mack was an outspoken critic of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, as well as one of the most vocal opponents of the Latin American television network teleSUR. He is also a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mack helped secure over $81 million to expand Interstate 75 in Southwest Florida, a project of significant concern to the region.

Unlike many members of Congress, Mack has been a vigorous and outspoken defender of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia
** Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere (Chairman)
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
** Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service and Labor Policy
** Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency and Financial Management (Vice Chair)
** Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending

==2012 U.S. Senate election==

Early in the election cycle, Mack was considered a potential candidate against incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in the 2012 Senate election. However, he declined to run on March 25, 2011, citing family and his work in the House of Representatives. On October 26, 2011, it was announced Mack had changed his mind and that he would seek the Republican nomination because he felt no one in the current field was able to defeat Nelson. His opponent in the primary was former Representative Dave Weldon, whom Mack defeated, winning 58% of the vote. Mack then lost to Nelson by over one million votes.

== Electoral history ==
















==Post-congressional career==
In 2013, Mack was hired as a partner at lobbying firm Liberty Partners Group, where his father was a chairman emeritus. Following his unsuccessful bid for the Senate, Mack founded two lobbying and consulting firms, Mack Strategies and Liberty International Group. In March 2014, he registered to become a lobbyist for American Task Force Argentina. As of September 2014, he was an executive vice president of public relations firm Levick as well as a registered lobbyist for Levick, Doral Financial and Las Vegas Sands. Mack considered entering Florida&#x27;s 19th congressional district special election in 2014 to replace Trey Radel but, in January 2014, officially declined to enter the race.

=== International lobbying ===
Mack has also worked extensively as a lobbyist for the government of Hungary. In December 2020, Mack joined Platinum Advisors DC to lobby in support of increased humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia. In 2017, he was accused of holding a &quot;sham hearing&quot; in the U.S. Capitol on behalf of a Ukrainian television studio.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Mack was involved in a bar fight with professional baseball player Ron Gant in Georgia. Mack suffered a broken ankle in the fight but a jury ultimately found that Gant was not liable for Mack&#x27;s injuries.

Mack and Ann Galluzzo were married in 1996 and divorced in 2006. They have a son named Connie Mack V and a daughter named Addison Mack.

In 2007, while representing his Florida district in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mack married then-U.S. Representative from California Mary Bono (R-CA), former wife of Glenn Baxley and widow of Sonny Bono. They were the third married couple to serve in the House of Representatives simultaneously. Mack and Bono divorced in 2013. He married Jennifer Key, an international development expert, in 2018. They have a son named William Arthur McGillicuddy.

<doc id="1185498" wikidata="Q898412" url="?curid=1185498" title="Fugacity">
<text>In thermodynamics, the fugacity of a real gas is an effective partial pressure which replaces the mechanical partial pressure in an accurate computation of chemical equilibrium. It is equal to the pressure of an ideal gas which has the same temperature and molar Gibbs free energy as the real gas.

Fugacities are determined experimentally or estimated from various models such as a Van der Waals gas that are closer to reality than an ideal gas. The real gas pressure and fugacity are related through the dimensionless fugacity coefficient
formula_1

For an ideal gas, fugacity and pressure are equal, and so . Taken at the same temperature and pressure, the difference between the molar Gibbs free energies of a real gas and the corresponding ideal gas is equal to .

The fugacity is closely related to the thermodynamic activity. For a gas, the activity is simply the fugacity divided by a reference pressure to give a dimensionless quantity. This reference pressure is called the standard state and normally chosen as 1 atmosphere or 1 bar.

Accurate calculations of chemical equilibrium for real gases should use the fugacity rather than the pressure. The thermodynamic condition for chemical equilibrium is that the total chemical potential of reactants is equal to that of products. If the chemical potential of each gas is expressed as a function of fugacity, the equilibrium condition may be transformed into the familiar reaction quotient form (or law of mass action) except that the pressures are replaced by fugacities.

For a condensed phase (liquid or solid) in equilibrium with its vapor phase, the chemical potential is equal to that of the vapor, and therefore the fugacity is equal to the fugacity of the vapor. This fugacity is approximately equal to the vapor pressure when the vapor pressure is not too high.

==Pure substance==
Fugacity is closely related to the chemical potential . In a pure substance, is equal to the Gibbs energy for a mole of the substance, and
formula_2
where and are the temperature and pressure, is the volume per mole and is the entropy per mole.

===Gas===
For an ideal gas the equation of state can be written as 
formula_3
where is the ideal gas constant. The differential change of the chemical potential between two states of slightly different pressures but equal temperature (i.e., ) is given by
formula_4where ln p is the natural logarithm of p.

For real gases the equation of state will depart from the simpler one, and the result above derived for an ideal gas will only be a good approximation provided that (a) the typical size of the molecule is negligible compared to the average distance between the individual molecules, and (b) 
the short range behavior of the inter-molecular potential can be neglected, i.e., when the molecules can be considered to rebound elastically off each other during molecular collisions. In other words, real gases behave like ideal gases at low pressures and high temperatures. At moderately high pressures, attractive interactions between molecules reduce the pressure compared to the ideal gas law; and at very high pressures, the sizes of the molecules are no longer negligible and repulsive forces between molecules increases the pressure. At low temperatures, molecules are more likely to stick together instead of rebounding elastically.

The ideal gas law can still be used to describe the behavior of a real gas if the pressure is replaced by a &quot;fugacity&quot; , defined so that
formula_5
and
formula_6
That is, at low pressures is the same as the pressure, so it has the same units as pressure. The ratio
formula_7
is called the &quot;fugacity coefficient&quot;.

If a reference state is denoted by a zero superscript, then integrating the equation for the chemical potential gives
formula_8
Note this can also be expressed with formula_9, a dimensionless quantity, called the &quot;activity&quot;.

Numerical example: Nitrogen gas (N2) at 0 °C and a pressure of atmospheres (atm) has a fugacity of  atm. This means that the molar Gibbs energy of real nitrogen at a pressure of 100 atm is equal to the molar Gibbs energy of nitrogen as an ideal gas at . The fugacity coefficient is .

The contribution of nonideality to the molar Gibbs energy of a real gas is equal to . For nitrogen at 100 atm, , which is less than the ideal value because of intermolecular attractive forces. Finally, the activity is just without units.

=== Condensed phase ===

The fugacity of a condensed phase (liquid or solid) is defined the same way as for a gas:
formula_10
and
formula_11
It is difficult to measure fugacity in a condensed phase directly; but if the condensed phase is &quot;saturated&quot; (in equilibrium with the vapor phase), the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal (). Combined with the above definition, this implies that 
formula_12

When calculating the fugacity of the compressed phase, one can generally assume the volume is constant. At constant temperature, the change in fugacity as the pressure goes from the saturation press to is
formula_13
This fraction is known as the Poynting factor. Using , where is the fugacity coefficient,
formula_14
This equation allows the fugacity to be calculated using tabulated values for saturated vapor pressure. Often the pressure is low enough for the vapor phase to be considered an ideal gas, so the fugacity coefficient is approximately equal to 1.

Unless pressures are very high, the Poynting factor is usually small and the exponential term is near 1. Frequently, the fugacity of the pure liquid is used as a reference state when defining and using mixture activity coefficients.

==Mixture==
The fugacity is most useful in mixtures. It does not add any new information compared to the chemical potential, but it has computational advantages. As the molar fraction of a component goes to zero, the chemical potential diverges but the fugacity goes to zero. In addition, there are natural reference states for fugacity (for example, an ideal gas makes a natural reference state for gas mixtures since the fugacity and pressure converge at low pressure).

===Gases===
In a mixture of gases, the fugacity of each component has a similar definition, with partial molar quantities instead of molar quantities (e.g., instead of and instead of ):
formula_15
and
formula_16
where is the partial pressure of component . The partial pressures obey Dalton&#x27;s law:
formula_17
where is the total pressure and is the mole fraction of the component (so the partial pressures add up to the total pressure). The fugacities commonly obey a similar law called the Lewis and Randall rule:
formula_18
where is the fugacity that component would have if the entire gas had that composition at the same temperature and pressure. Both laws are expressions of an assumption that the gases behave independently.

===Liquids===
In a liquid mixture, the fugacity of each component is equal to that of a vapor component in equilibrium with the liquid. In an ideal solution, the fugacities obey the Lewis-Randall rule:
formula_19
where is the mole fraction in the liquid and is the fugacity of the pure liquid phase. This is a good approximation when the component molecules have similar size, shape and polarity.

In a dilute solution with two components, the component with the larger molar fraction (the solvent) may still obey Raoult&#x27;s law even if the other component (the solute) has different properties. That is because its molecules experience essentially the same environment that they do in the absence of the solute. By contrast, each solute molecule is surrounded by solvent molecules, so it obeys a different law known as Henry&#x27;s law. By Henry&#x27;s law, the fugacity of the solute is proportional to its concentration. The constant of proportionality (a measured Henry&#x27;s constant) depends on whether the concentration is represented by the mole fraction, molality or molarity.

==Temperature and pressure dependence==
The pressure dependence of fugacity (at constant temperature) is given by
formula_20
and is always positive.

The temperature dependence at constant pressure is
formula_21
where is the change in molar enthalpy as the gas expands, liquid vaporizes, or solid sublimates into a vacuum. Also, if the pressure is , then
formula_22
Since the temperature and entropy are positive, decreases with increasing temperature.

==Measurement==
The fugacity can be deduced from measurements of volume as a function of pressure at constant temperature. In that case,
formula_23
This integral can also be calculated using an equation of state.

The integral can be recast in an alternative form using the compressibility factor
formula_24
Then
formula_25
This is useful because of the theorem of corresponding states: If the pressure and temperature at the critical point of the gas are and , we can define reduced properties and . Then, to a good approximation, most gases have the same value of for the same reduced temperature and pressure. However, in geochemical applications, this principle ceases to be accurate at pressures where metamorphism occurs.

For a gas obeying the van der Waals equation, the explicit formula for the fugacity coefficient is
formula_26
This formula is based on the molar volume. Since the pressure and the molar volume are related through the equation of state; a typical procedure would be to choose a volume, calculate the corresponding pressure, and then evaluate the right-hand side of the equation.

==History==
The word &quot;fugacity&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;fugere&quot;, to flee. In the sense of an &quot;escaping tendency&quot;, it was introduced to thermodynamics in 1901 by the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis and popularized in an influential textbook by Lewis and Merle Randall, &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances&quot;, in 1923. The &quot;escaping tendency&quot; referred to the flow of matter between phases and played a similar role to that of temperature in heat flow.

At the time of Lewis&#x27; 1901 paper, physical chemistry was primarily based on inexact gas pressure laws, involving vapor pressures and partial pressures. By replacing these gas pressures with fugacity, Lewis preserved these laws’ mathematical simplicity while accounting for real-world deviations. Historians argue that Lewis, a young scientist aware of Josiah Willard Gibbs’ rigorous but abstract thermodynamics (including chemical potential), sought to reform the prevailing experimental framework with exact equations that retained practical utility. Although Lewis’ 1901 paper omitted Gibbs’ formalism entirely, his later works explicitly linked fugacity to chemical potential.

<doc id="1185500" wikidata="Q3544209" url="?curid=1185500" title="USS Loggerhead">
<text>USS &quot;Loggerhead&quot; (SS-374/AGSS-374), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the loggerhead, &quot;Caretta caretta&quot;, a very large, carnivorous sea turtle common in the warmer parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.

&quot;Loggerhead&quot; (SS-374) was laid down on 1 April 1944 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc.; launched 13 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Barbara Fox; and commissioned on 9 February 1945.

&quot;Loggerhead&quot; emerged from the Manitowoc River into Lake Michigan on 1 March 1945 and headed via Chicago to Lockport, Ill., where she entered a floating drydock and was towed down the Mississippi River. She arrived at New Orleans 7 March and departed 5 days later transiting the Panama Canal and arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 April.

&quot;Loggerhead&quot;&#x27;s first war patrol started 15 May when she departed Hawaii and headed via Saipan for the Luzon Straits and the South China Sea. Patrolling along the east coast of Hainan Island, she sighted an enemy hospital ship 11 June and allowed it to pass unharmed. Three days later, &quot;Loggerhead&quot; bombarded a suspected radar installation at Gap Rock south of Hong Kong, causing severe damage to the tower.

Much time was devoted to lifeguard duty during this patrol. Changing patrol areas and briefly stopping at Subic Bay 1 July for fuel, the submarine headed for an assigned lifeguard station south of Hong Kong. She stopped numerous native boats, questioned their crews, and learned that the Japanese were commandeering all native boats in the ports which they controlled.

On 13 July the submarine fired five torpedoes at enemy ships in Semarang Roadstead. The next day, the submarine headed for Australia, transiting Lombok Straits between Bali and Lombok Island during daylight on 14 July. While &quot;Loggerhead&quot; passed between these islands, the enemy shore batteries surprised her with hot fire. Evading the bursts of the Japanese shells through skillful maneuvers, &quot;Loggerhead&quot; escaped undamaged. She arrived at Fremantle on 19 July.

The end of hostilities on 15 August found &quot;Loggerhead&quot; two days out of Fremantle heading for the Gulf of Siam on her second war patrol. She put in Subic Bay on 22 August, departed for the United States 31 August via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Francisco 22 September 1945. &quot;Loggerhead&quot; was decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard 16 June 1946 and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

In 1960 she was assigned as a US Naval Reserve Training Ship and towed to Portland, Oregon. In December 1962 she was reclassified an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-374, and she continued to serve as a reserve training submarine in Portland until 30 June 1967 when she was relieved by auxiliary submarine . Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the same date, &quot;Loggerhead&quot; was sold for scrap in early 1969.

<doc id="1185505" wikidata="Q7833701" url="?curid=1185505" title="Violence against transgender people">
<text>Violence against transgender people includes emotional, physical, sexual, or verbal violence targeted towards transgender people. The term has also been applied to hate speech directed at transgender people and at depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them. Trans and non-binary gender adolescents can experience bashing in the form of bullying and harassment. When compared to their cisgender peers, trans and non-binary gender youth are at increased risk for victimisation and substance abuse.

Institutional discrimination against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia is a common occurrence for trans people. Hate crimes against trans people are common, and &quot;in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.&quot; Protections against violence for transgender people vary by jurisdiction. Due to continued violence and murder of transgender people, communities have observed Transgender Day of Remembrance since 1999.

== Differentiation from gay bashing ==

Unlike gay bashing, anti-trans violence is committed because of the target&#x27;s actual or perceived gender identity or gender expression, not sexual orientation.
At least since the Stonewall riots in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities. However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation (&quot;gay-bashing&quot;). Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research. One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them. However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as having a common cause.

In the murder case of Gwen Araujo, the perpetrators accused of hate crimes against her tried to use a trans panic defense, an extension of the gay panic defense. The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans panic defense. One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one&#x27;s repressed homosexuality).

== Laws covering gender identity ==
===International===
The United Nations adopted their Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights. There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration &quot;without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status&quot;. 
* Article 5 states that &quot;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;
* Article 7 states that &quot;[a]ll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination&quot;. 
* Article 9 bans &quot;arbitrary arrest, detention or exile&quot; (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that &quot;[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&quot;

=== Pakistan ===
Transgender rights are legally protected by the law of Pakistan via the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 which prohibits discrimination and violence against trans people in the country. 

===United States===

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Utah, Washington, and Washington, D.C.).

The Matthew Shepard Act expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices. Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines. This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.

== By country ==

=== Americas ===

==== United States ====

In the late 2000s in Seattle&#x27;s gay village of Capitol Hill, there was evidence of an increase in incidents of violence against trans people.

=====&#x27;Bathroom bills&#x27; to enforce gendered bathroom use=====


Bathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity. There have been a number of bills proposed in the United States intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate. Some of these bills are justified with the rationale of protecting cisgender women from violent acts committed by cisgender men entering their facilities under the pretense of identifying as transgender women, although there is no evidence thus far of any instances of this.

Some transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using gender-neutral bathrooms, but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely. Using bathrooms that are incongruent with the gender one presents as breaks social norms while following laws, and one study found that cisgender people report discomfort at the incongruous appearance between someone&#x27;s gender presentation and the bathroom they&#x27;re in even when the bathroom matches their assigned sex. 

=====Harassment of transgender people in bathrooms=====

Transgender people are more likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people than vice versa. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including &quot;denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault.&quot; An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra said she heard the &quot;voice of a man&quot; from a locked stall in the women&#x27;s restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman. This kind of tactic can result in public outing of a transgender person&#x27;s current or former gender identity.

One survey of transgender populations conducted in Washington, DC, by the group &quot;DC Trans Coalition&quot;, &quot;found that 70 percent of survey respondents report experiencing verbal harassment, assault, and being denied access to public toilets.&quot; It also found that &quot;54 percent of all respondents reported having some sort of physical problem from trying to avoid using public toilets, such as dehydration, kidney infections, and urinary tract infections&quot; making access to safe restrooms a public health issue.

On 23 February 2020, a restaurant patron in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico made a police report that a transgender woman had entered the women&#x27;s bathroom. Police arrived at the restaurant and spoke to the transgender woman. Someone filmed the police interaction and posted the video to social media. Later that day, the transgender woman—Alexa Negrón Luciano, also known as Neulisa Luciano Ruiz—was murdered.

=== Asia ===

==== India ====

In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false WhatsApp rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.

==== Pakistan ====

Despite having legal protections, trans people in Pakistan continue to be targets of violence. Between 2015 and September 2020, 68 transgender people were killed in Pakistan, and 1,500 were sexually assaulted in multiple incidents. In 2018, transgender people reportedly experienced 479 violence incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In 2019, Amnesty International published a report indicated Shama, a transgender journalist, was raped by nine men in one of Pakistan&#x27;s cities, Peshawar.

In September 2020, a prominent transgender activist Gul Panra, was shot six times. Nayyab Ali was allegedly sexually assaulted and attacked by acid as a result of her being transgender.

===Europe===

Reports of hate-motivated violence against LGBTQ+ people increased from 11 percent in 2019 to 14 percent in 2023. Violence against transgender people in Europe is significantly more prevalent than that against other members of the continent&#x27;s LGBTQ+ community.

==== United Kingdom ====

Hate crimes against transgender people in England, Scotland and Wales, as recorded by police, increased 81% from the 2016–17 fiscal year (1,073 crimes) to the 2018–19 fiscal year (1,944 crimes).

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all. Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, as predators or as thieves. A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of Chelsea Manning, a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to WikiLeaks. A Fox News story on Manning&#x27;s transition was introduced with the Aerosmith song &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, while host Gretchen Carlson referred to Chelsea by her deadname, mocking &quot;The New York Times&quot; for &quot;helping him&quot; by using Manning&#x27;s preferred gender pronoun. The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her using her deadname so as &quot;to avoid confusion&quot; until a court mandated her correct gender pronouns.

==Trans health==
According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.

===Mental health===

Transgender people experience greater mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical health disparities (e.g., cardiovascular disease). From The 2015 National Transgender Survey Report out of 27,715 respondents &quot;forty-eight percent (48%) have seriously thought about killing themselves in the past year, compared to 4% of the U.S. population, and 82% have had serious thoughts about killing themselves at some point in their life.&quot; Trans people also have a higher rate of suicide attempts than the population as a whole. In 2013, 2.2% of U.S. adults had attempted suicide while 41% of trans people had attempted suicide at some point in their life in 2011. The rate of attempted suicide in transgender individuals increased to 51% for those bullied or harassed in school, 55% for those who recently lost a job due to bias, and 61% and 64% for those who were victims of physical and sexual assault, respectively.
Low self-esteem in transgender people has been linked to being at high-risk for HIV transmission. In 2008, the rate of HIV in transgender women in North America was 27.7%.

===Access to healthcare===
In the 2010 and 2011 NTDSRs, 19% of the people surveyed reported having been refused medical care due to their gender identity and 50% reported lack of provider knowledge of transgender health needs.
Under the Affordable Care Act, it is illegal for any health program receiving federal funding to discriminate based on gender identity. Discrimination includes refusal to admit, treat or provide any services that are available for other patients; subjection of patients to intrusive examination; harass or refuse to respond to harassment by other staff or patients; refusal to provide support services; obligation to participate in conversion therapy; and any sort of interference in the pursuit of health care rights.

===Racial disparities===

Race has been shown to compound manifestations of existing discrimination on the basis of gender identity.
Black trans women have the highest suicide rate of any other group in the United States, at almost half attempting in their lives, while cisgender black women attempt suicide at a rate of 1.7% on average. 
Trans students of color face higher rates of harassment and violence in schools. American Indian transgender students face the highest rates of sexual assault in school at 24%, followed by multiracial (18%), Asian (17%), and black (15%) students. White transgender students face a 9% rate of sexual assault in K–12.
Black trans women have a higher rate of HIV infection than other groups, with a 30.8–56.3% rate, versus 27.7% of MTF transgender people on average.

====Police and incarceration====

In the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 22% of respondents who had interacted with the police reported harassment due to bias. 20% reported denial of equal services. 48% reported being uncomfortable asking for police assistance. Respondents who had served time in jail reported a higher rate of harassment by officers than by others in jail. For all respondents, 7% reported being held in a jail cell solely due to gender identity expression, while this number was 41% for black and 21% for Latino trans respondents. 
Transgender people have reported being refused medical care, particularly hormone therapy, in prison, with black trans people and American Indian trans people with the highest reporting rates.

<doc id="1185517" wikidata="Q777476" url="?curid=1185517" title="Joey Maxim">
<text>Giuseppe Antonio Berardinelli (March 28, 1922 – June 2, 2001) was an American professional boxer. He was the World Light Heavyweight Champion from 1950 to 1952. He took the ring-name Joey Maxim from the Maxim gun, the world&#x27;s first self-acting machine gun, based on his ability to rapidly throw a large number of left jabs.

== Early life ==
Maxim was born and raised in Collinwood, a neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Maxim learned to box at a very young age. Following a successful amateur career, during which he won the Golden Gloves, he turned professional in 1940. Maxim boxed fairly regularly at exhibitions during the war years while serving as a military police officer at Miami Beach, Florida.

====Maxim becomes world champion====

It is somewhat surprising that Maxim had to wait so long for a world title shot, he was 28 and had already fought 87 times as a professional, considering his undoubted ability. His chance came on January 24, 1950, against British boxer Freddie Mills, who was making his first defense, at London&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Centre. Maxim, very much the underdog against the popular Englishman, won the fight by knockout in the 10th round. After the fight three of Mills&#x27;s teeth were found embedded in Maxim&#x27;s left glove, Mills never fought again.

Maxim&#x27;s next major fight was on May 30, 1951, when he made a bid for Ezzard Charles&#x27;s world heavyweight title. Maxim was unsuccessful, losing on points.

====June 25, 1952: Joey Maxim vs. Sugar Ray Robinson====
The most famous fight of Maxim&#x27;s career was on June 25, 1952, when he made his second defense of his world light heavyweight crown, against Sugar Ray Robinson at Yankee Stadium. The fight had originally been scheduled for June 23, but was postponed due to torrential rain. By the time the fight took place New York City was in the midst of a record heat wave.

During the fight Robinson built up a large points lead over the champion, although Maxim began to come on later in the fight. Robinson gradually succumbed to hyperthermia and Maxim&#x27;s harder punches. He collapsed to the canvas at the end of the 13th round, but managed to stagger back to his corner. However, Robinson failed to answer the bell at the start of the 14th, even though he only had to remain on his feet to win the fight and Maxim won by a technical knockout. This was the only time that Robinson was stopped in his 200 fight career.

By this time the original referee, Ruby Goldstein, had himself been forced to retire from the fight after collapsing into the ropes complaining that he could no longer continue. This meant that a substitute referee, Ray Miller, had to be called out to finish the fight. Goldstein and Robinson were not the only people who had to be stretchered from the stadium: several dozen spectators also collapsed during the fight. Between them, the two fighters lost over 20 pounds in weight during the fight.

===Late career===
Despite winning, the Robinson fight took a heavy toll on Maxim. He lost his world title six months later to the veteran Archie Moore. Following this loss Maxim, formerly one of the division&#x27;s most active fighters, fought only 14 fights in the remaining 6 years of his career. These fights included two rematches with &quot;The Old Mongoose&quot; Archie Moore, both of which Maxim lost. Maxim retired in 1958 after losing six consecutive fights.

Maxim retired with a record of 82 wins (21 by KO), 29 losses, and 4 draws; in his 115 fight career, he was knocked out only once. During his career he defeated such legendary figures as Jersey Joe Walcott, Jimmy Bivins, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Floyd Patterson.

==Life after boxing==
After his retirement Maxim spent time as a stand-up comic, restaurateur, and taxi driver. He also served as a greeter at hotels and casinos located in Las Vegas.

He appeared in Herschell Gordon Lewis&#x27;s 1963 nudie-cutie &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bares&quot; as himself, playing a nightclub owner. The movie was billed as the &quot;first nudist musical.&quot; He was prominently featured on the movie poster, with the blurb:

&quot;It&#x27;s me...Joey Maxim, the former world&#x27;s light heavyweight champion! I&#x27;m one of the stars! My first screen appearance.&quot;

The role did not lead to any more motion picture work, though he did appear as an extra in the 1999 film &quot;Play It to the Bone&quot;.

He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1994.

Maxim&#x27;s wife Michelina, with whom he had two daughters, died in 1977.

In February 2001, Maxim suffered a stroke. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 2, 2001. In addition to his daughters, he was survived by his mother, Henrietta Berardinelli, who was 97 years old (died at 101 in 2006), and six great-grandchildren.

<doc id="1185519" wikidata="Q3218843" url="?curid=1185519" title="Price controls">
<text>Price controls are restrictions set in place and enforced by governments, on the prices that can be charged for goods and services in a market. The intent behind implementing such controls can stem from the desire to maintain affordability of goods even during shortages, and to slow inflation, or alternatively to ensure a minimum income for providers of certain goods or to try to achieve a living wage. There are two primary forms of price control: a price ceiling, the maximum price that can be charged; and a price floor, the minimum price that can be charged. A well-known example of a price ceiling is rent control, which limits the increases that a landlord is permitted by government to charge for rent. A widely used price floor is minimum wage (wages are the price of labor). Historically, price controls have often been imposed as part of a larger incomes policy package also employing wage controls and other regulatory elements.

Although price controls are routinely used by governments, Western economists generally agree that consumer price controls do not accomplish what they intend to in market economies, and many economists instead recommend such controls should be avoided; however, since the credibility revolution started in the 1990s, minimum wages have found strong support among some economists.

==History==

The Roman Emperor Diocletian tried to set maximum prices for all commodities in the late 3rd century AD but with little success. In the early 14th century, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji instituted several market reforms, which included price-fixing for a wide range of goods, including grains, cloth, slaves and animals. However, a few months after his death, these measures were revoked by his son Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah. During the French Revolution, the Law of the Maximum set price limits on the sale of food and other staples. Within Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries, after the price revolution, a permanent regulation on the price of wheat (called &quot;tasa del trigo&quot;) was established. This intervention was discussed by theologians and jurists of this time.

Governments in planned economies typically control prices on most or all goods but have not sustained high economic performance and have been almost entirely replaced by mixed economies. Price controls have also been used in modern times in less-planned economies, such as rent control. During World War I, the United States Food Administration enforced price controls on food. Price controls were also imposed in the US and Nazi Germany during World War II.

===Postwar===

Wage controls have been tried in many countries to reduce inflation, seldom with success. Since inflation can be caused by both aggregate supply or demand, wage controls can fail as a result of supply shocks or excessive stimulus during times of high sovereign debt (increases to the Monetary Aggregate System M2). 

====United Kingdom====

The National Board for Prices and Incomes was created by the government of Harold Wilson in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices. The Prices and Incomes Act 1966 c. 33 affected UK labour law, regarding wage levels and price policies. It allowed the government to begin a process to scrutinise rising levels of wages (then around 8% per year) by initiating reports and inquiries and ultimately giving orders for a standstill. The objective was to control inflation. It proved unpopular after the 1960s.

====United States====

In the United States, price controls have been enacted several times. The first time price controls were enacted nationally was in 1906 as a part of the Hepburn Act. In World War I the War Industries Board was established to set priorities, fix prices, and standardize products to support the war efforts of the United States. During the 1930s, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) created the National Recovery Administration, that set prices and created codes of &quot;fair practices&quot;. In May 1935, the Supreme Court held that the mandatory codes section of NIRA were unconstitutional, in the court case of &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot;. In 1971, President Richard Nixon issued Executive Order 11615 (pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970), imposing a 90-day freeze on wages and prices. The constitutionality of this action was challenged and upheld in the case of &quot;Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally&quot;.

The individual states have sometimes chosen to implement their own control policies. In the 1860s, several midwestern states of the United States, namely Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted a series of laws called the Granger Laws, primarily to regulate rising fare prices of railroad and grain elevator companies. The state of Hawaii briefly introduced a cap on the wholesale price of gasoline (the Gas Cap Law) in an effort to fight &quot;price gouging&quot; in that state in 2005. Because it was widely seen as too soft and ineffective, it was repealed shortly thereafter.

====Venezuela====

According to Girish Gupta from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, price controls have created a scarcity of basic goods and made black markets flourish under President Nicolás Maduro.

====India====

In India, the government first enacted price controls in 2013 for the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO). This order gave the local regulatory body and the Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority the power to set ceiling prices on the National List of Essential medicines.

====Sri Lanka====

In Sri Lanka, the Consumer Affairs Authority has the power to set the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for goods specified by the government as essential commodities. In 2021 the Sri Lankan government enacted price controls on several essential items resulting in shortages.

==Price floor==


A price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product, good, commodity, or service. A price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price in order to be effective. The equilibrium price, commonly called the &quot;market price&quot;, is the price where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the (equilibrium) values of economic variables will not change, often described as the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal (in a perfectly competitive market). Governments use price floors to keep certain prices from going too low. Two common price floors are minimum wage laws and supply management in Canadian agriculture. Other price floors include regulated US airfares prior to 1978 and minimum price per-drink laws for alcohol. Since the credibility revolution starting in the 1990s, minimum wages have often found strong support among economists.

Advantages of a price floor are:
* May motivate producers to produce more.
* May prevent the fluctuation of prices of agricultural products.
* May reduce the over-exploitation of producers.
* May reduce poverty and increase productivity among employees (in minimum wages)

Disadvantages of a price floor are:
* Supply may exceed demand.
* Resources may be wasted.
* The government may be forced to buy the excess supply or it may be discarded (e.g., in an agricultural context).

==Price ceiling==
A related government intervention to price floor, which is also a price control, is the price ceiling; it sets the maximum price that can legally be charged for a good or service, with a common example being rent control. A price ceiling is a price control, or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product, commodity, or service. Governments use price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation, in the event of an investment bubble, or in the event of monopoly ownership of a product, all of which can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing, leading to shortages.

Further problems can occur if a government sets unrealistic price ceilings, causing business failures, stock crashes, or even economic crises. In fully unregulated market economies, price ceilings do not exist. While price ceilings are often imposed by governments, there are also price ceilings that are implemented by non-governmental organizations such as companies, such as the practice of resale price maintenance. With resale price maintenance, a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer&#x27;s product at certain prices (resale price maintenance), at or below a price ceiling (maximum resale price maintenance) or at or above a price floor.

==Criticism==

The primary criticism leveled against the price ceiling type of price controls is that by keeping prices artificially low, demand is increased to the point where supply cannot keep up, leading to shortages in the price-controlled product. For example, Lactantius wrote that Diocletian &quot;by various taxes, he had made all things exceedingly expensive, attempted by a law to limit their prices. Then much blood [of merchants] was shed for trifles, men were afraid to offer anything for sale, and the scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever. Until, in the end, the [price limit] law, after having proved destructive to many people, was from mere necessity abolished.&quot;

As with Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Maximum Prices, shortages lead to black markets where prices for the same good exceed those of an uncontrolled market. Furthermore, once controls are removed, prices will immediately increase, which can temporarily shock the economic system. Black markets flourish in most countries during wartime. States that are engaged in total war or other large-scale, extended wars often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as food, gasoline, rubber, metal, etc., typically through rationing. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The rationing and price controls enforced in many countries during World War II encouraged widespread black market activity. One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the Ministry of Food than actually happened. Another in Britain was supplies from the US, intended only for use in US army bases on British land, but leaked into the local native British black market.

A classic example of how price controls cause shortages was during the Arab oil embargo between October 19, 1973, and March 17, 1974. Long lines of cars and trucks quickly appeared at retail gas stations in the U.S. and some stations closed because of a shortage of fuel at the low price set by the U.S. Cost of Living Council. The fixed price was below what the market would otherwise bear and, as a result, the inventory disappeared. It made no difference whether prices were voluntarily or involuntarily posted below the market clearing price. Scarcity resulted in either case. Price controls fail to achieve their proximate aim, which is to reduce prices paid by retail consumers, but such controls do manage to reduce supply. Nobel Memorial Prize winner Milton Friedman said, &quot;We economists don&#x27;t know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can&#x27;t sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you&#x27;ll have a tomato shortage. It&#x27;s the same with oil or gas.&quot;

U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, enacting Nixon&#x27;s &quot;New Economic Policy&quot;, lifted price controls that had begun in 1971 (part of the &quot;Nixon Shock&quot;). This lifting of price controls resulted in a rapid increase in prices. Price freezes were re-established five months later. Stagflation was eventually ended in the United States when the Federal Reserve under chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to unusually high levels. This successfully ended high inflation but caused a recession that ended in the early 1980s.
