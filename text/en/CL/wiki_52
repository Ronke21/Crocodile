<text>Radiosurgery is surgery using radiation, that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of tissue using ionizing radiation rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat cancer. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as &quot;a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest&quot;.

In stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), the word &quot;stereotactic&quot; refers to a three-dimensional coordinate system that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient&#x27;s diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) when used outside the central nervous system (CNS).

==History==
Stereotactic radiosurgery was first developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small targets in the brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation was made in the early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Additional units were installed in the 1980s all with 201 cobalt-60 sources.

In parallel to these developments, a similar approach was designed for a linear particle accelerator or Linac. Installation of the first 4 MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory led to the development of a 6 MeV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956. Linac units quickly became favored devices for conventional fractionated radiotherapy but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated Linac radiosurgery became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in February 1986.

===21st century===
Technological improvements in medical imaging and computing have led to increased clinical adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery and have broadened its scope in the 21st century. The localization accuracy and precision that are implicit in the word &quot;stereotactic&quot; remain of utmost importance for radiosurgical interventions and are significantly improved via image-guidance technologies such as the N-localizer and Sturm-Pastyr localizer that were originally developed for stereotactic surgery.

In the 21st century the original concept of radiosurgery expanded to include treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, without the need for a surgical incision. Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy the mechanism to achieve treatment is subtly different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications. Stereotactic radiosurgery has a greater emphasis on delivering precise, high doses to small areas, to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue. The same principle is followed in conventional radiotherapy although lower dose rates spread over larger areas are more likely to be used (for example as in VMAT treatments). Fractionated radiotherapy relies more heavily on the different radiosensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.

Today, both Gamma Knife and Linac radiosurgery programs are commercially available worldwide. While the Gamma Knife is dedicated to radiosurgery, many Linacs are built for conventional fractionated radiotherapy and require additional technology and expertise to become dedicated radiosurgery tools. There is not a clear difference in efficacy between these different approaches. The major manufacturers, Varian and Elekta offer dedicated radiosurgery Linacs as well as machines designed for conventional treatment with radiosurgery capabilities. Systems designed to complement conventional Linacs with beam-shaping technology, treatment planning, and image-guidance tools to provide. An example of a dedicated radiosurgery Linac is the CyberKnife, a compact Linac mounted onto a robotic arm that moves around the patient and irradiates the tumor from a large set of fixed positions, thereby mimicking the Gamma Knife concept.

==Mechanism of action==

The fundamental principle of radiosurgery is that of selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are damaging to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from the water in the cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell&#x27;s death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one joule of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the sievert, a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.
==Clinical applications==
When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).

===Brain and spine===
Radiosurgery is performed by a multidisciplinary team of neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists and medical physicists to operate and maintain highly sophisticated, highly precise and complex instruments, including medical linear accelerators, the Gamma Knife unit and the Cyberknife unit. The highly precise irradiation of targets within the brain and spine is planned using information from medical images that are obtained via computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography.

Radiosurgery is indicated primarily for the therapy of tumors, vascular lesions and functional disorders. Significant clinical judgment must be used with this technique and considerations must include lesion type, pathology if available, size, location and age and general health of the patient. General contraindications to radiosurgery include excessively large size of the target lesion, or lesions too numerous for practical treatment. Patients can be treated within one to five days as outpatients. By comparison, the average hospital stay for a craniotomy (conventional neurosurgery, requiring the opening of the skull) is about 15 days. The radiosurgery outcome may not be evident until months after the treatment. Since radiosurgery does not remove the tumor but inactivates it biologically, lack of growth of the lesion is normally considered to be treatment success. General indications for radiosurgery include many kinds of brain tumors, such as acoustic neuromas, germinomas, meningiomas, metastases, trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous malformations, and skull base tumors, among others. 

Stereotatic radiosurgery of the spinal metastasis is efficient in controlling pain in up to 90% of the cases and ensures stability of the tumours on imaging evaluation in 95% of the cases, and is more efficient for spinal metastasis involving one or two segments. Meanwhile, conventional external beam radiotherapy is more suitable for multiple spinal involvement.

=== Combination therapy ===
SRS may be administered alone or in combination with other therapies. For brain metastases, these treatment options include whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgery, and systemic therapies. However, a recent systematic review found no difference in the affects on overall survival or deaths due to brain metastases when comparing SRS treatment alone to SRS plus WBRT treatment or WBRT alone.

===Other bodily organs===
Expansion of stereotactic radiotherapy to other lesions is increasing, and includes liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.

==Risks==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of radiosurgery, due in large part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for stereotactic radiosurgery. In the U.S. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

This is evidence that immunotherapy may be useful for treatment of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy.

== Types of radiation source ==
The selection of the proper kind of radiation and device depends on many factors including lesion type, size, and location in relation to critical structures. Data suggest that similar clinical outcomes are possible with all of the various techniques. More important than the device used are issues regarding indications for treatment, total dose delivered, fractionation schedule and conformity of the treatment plan.

=== Gamma Knife ===

A Gamma Knife (also known as the Leksell Gamma Knife) is used to treat brain tumors by administering high-intensity gamma radiation therapy in a manner that concentrates the radiation over a small volume. The device was invented in 1967 at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, by Lars Leksell, Romanian-born neurosurgeon Ladislau Steiner, and radiobiologist Börje Larsson from Uppsala University, Sweden.

A Gamma Knife typically contains 201 cobalt-60 sources of approximately 30 curies each (1.1 TBq), placed in a hemispheric array in a heavily shielded assembly. The device aims gamma radiation through a target point in the patient&#x27;s brain. The patient wears a specialized helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull, so that the brain tumor remains stationary at the target point of the gamma rays. An ablative dose of radiation is thereby sent through the tumor in one treatment session, while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.

Gamma Knife therapy, like all radiosurgery, uses doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is able to accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery has proven effective for patients with benign or malignant brain tumors up to in size, vascular malformations such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), pain, and other functional problems. For treatment of trigeminal neuralgia the procedure may be used repeatedly on patients.

Acute complications following Gamma Knife radiosurgery are rare, and complications are related to the condition being treated.

=== Linear accelerator-based therapies ===
A linear accelerator (linac) produces x-rays from the impact of accelerated electrons striking a high &quot;z&quot; target, usually tungsten. The process is also referred to as &quot;x-ray therapy&quot; or &quot;photon therapy.&quot; The emission head, or &quot;gantry&quot;, is mechanically rotated around the patient in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the &quot;couch&quot;, can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of the movements of the gantry and of the couch allow the computerized planning of the volume of tissue that is going to be irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6 MeV are commonly used for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40 mm in 5 mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. Linacs were capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3 mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.

The first such systems were developed by John R. Adler, a Stanford University professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Russell and Peter Schonberg at Schonberg Research, and commercialized under the brand name CyberKnife.

=== Proton beam therapy ===
Protons may also be used in radiosurgery in a procedure called Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) or proton therapy. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200 MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient&#x27;s body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, since most of the proton&#x27;s energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the &quot;depth charge effect&quot; by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic chiasm or brainstem. The development of &quot;intensity modulated&quot; techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.

 there was no evidence that proton beam therapy is better than any other types of treatment in most cases, except for a &quot;handful of rare pediatric cancers&quot;. Critics, responding to the increasing number of very expensive PBT installations, spoke of a &quot;medical arms race&quot; and &quot;crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy&quot;.

<doc id="1172105" wikidata="Q885788" url="?curid=1172105" title="Blue Mound State Park">
<text>Blue Mound State Park is a state park in Wisconsin, United States, located atop the largest hill in the southern half of the state, near the village of Blue Mounds. The park features a pair of observation towers affording views of the Wisconsin River valley and Baraboo Range to the north, the mounds, buttes, and rolling forests of the Driftless Area to the south and west, and the young glacial plains and city of Madison to the east.

==Geology==
West Blue Mound (elev. ), the park&#x27;s namesake, rises approximately above the Military Ridge. However, when viewed from several miles to the north or south, the apparent local relief can be , as the highest point of the top of the mound sits almost exactly above the Wisconsin River at Arena, 10 miles to the north. This makes West Blue Mound the most prominent peak in the state of Wisconsin. The mountain, as most of the other large mounds of the Driftless Area, is an outlier of Niagara dolomitic limestone. It is a monadnock, having been created through centuries of erosion, with the harder dolomite being more weather-resistant than the other surrounding rock of the region.

==Activities and amenities==
The park contains a large open field, a swimming pool (the only one in a Wisconsin state park), shelters, campsites, and many miles of trails for hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. There is a nature center by the picnic area with natural history exhibits. Naturalists offer programs in the summer. The Military Ridge State Trail, which follows the natural east-west contour of the ridgeline from Fitchburg to Dodgeville, abuts on the southern edge of the park.

The park is used as the finish line for the Horribly Hilly Hundreds bicycle challenge ride. In Chicago&#x27;s bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the park would have contained the finish line for the road cycling race.

==Friends of Blue Mound State Park==
A volunteer group, the Friends of Blue Mound State Park, is a group of volunteers working to benefit the park by enhancing and preserving its natural resources, while offering activities and projects that improve the park guests&#x27; visits. The Friends play a key role in many special events, including the annual Candlelight Ski, annual campout, trail construction and interpretive presentations.

<text>Thyagaraja Aradhana is an annual &quot;aradhana&quot; (a Sanskrit term meaning act of glorifying God or a person) of Telugu saint composer Tyagaraja. The music festival is observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, primarily in Tiruvaiyaru in Thanjavur district of Tamilnadu, the place where Tyagaraja attained Jeeva Samadhi. The aradhana is observed on Pushya Bahula Panchami day when the saint attained Jeeva samadhi, where the musicians render the saint&#x27;s Pancharatna Kritis.

==History==
The &quot;aradhana&quot; (Ceremony of Adoration) is held every year on the anniversary of the demise of the saint. This is on Pushya Bahula Panchami day (the fifth day of the waning moon in the Hindu lunar month of &quot;Pushya&quot;). The &quot;Aradhana&quot; is conducted by the Sri Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha and is held in the precincts of the &quot;samadhi&quot; (memorial) of the saint located at Thiruvaiyaru village, Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India.

The Aradhana in its present format is not even a hundred years old. Thyagaraja died in 1847. A few days before his death, he had formally renounced everything and become a sanyasi. When he passed on, his mortal remains were buried on the banks of the river Kaveri and a small memorial was built at the site. His disciples returned to their respective villages and observed his death anniversary at their own homes. The memorial soon fell into neglect and had become quite dilapidated by 1903, when two of the last surviving students to have been taught by Tyagaraja happened to make a nostalgic visit to the site. These were the elderly and eminent musicians Umayalpuram Krishna Bhagavatar and Sundara Bhagavatar. They were dismayed by the neglect and dilapidation; indeed, they had to search for the memorial in the wild foliage of the riverbank. They arranged for the renovation of the &quot;samadhi&quot; and decided to commemorate the &quot;tithi&quot; or death anniversary of their &quot;guru&quot; every year at the Samadhi itself.

From the following year, efforts were made by musical stalwarts to observe the death anniversary regularly at Thiruvayyaru, and to use the occasion as an opportunity for his followers to converge and interact with each other. In 1905, a lavish ceremony, complete with feeding of the poor and worship at the memorial as per Vedic tenets, was celebrated. While Umayalpuram Krishna Bhagavatar and Sundara Bhagavatar were the moving force behind the renovations and celebrations, the brothers Thillaisthanam Narasimha Bhagavatar and Thillaisthanam Panju Bhagavatar were the main financiers and organizers. By the following year, the brothers had fallen out with each other. From 1906 onwards, each began conducting a parallel Aradhana. Various musicians also began aligned themselves with one or the other brother and two rival factions came into being. The group (and the &quot;aradhana&quot; celebration) conducted by Narasimha Bhagavatar came to be called the &quot;Periya Katchi&quot; (&quot;senior party,&quot; since he was the elder) and that of Panju Bhat became known as the &quot;Chinna Katchi.&quot; With the passing of the Tillaisthanam brothers, the Periya Katchi came under the control of the ace violinist Malaikottai Govindasami Pillai, and the Chinna Katchi under that of Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, the noted Harikatha exponent. Gradually, a convention emerged whereby the Chinna Katchi&#x27;s celebrations began five days before the Aradhana and concluded on the Aradhana day, while the Periya Katchi&#x27;s celebration began on Aradhana day and continued for four days after that. Both groups organised music performances and feeding of the poor and so the public was the real beneficiary during the nine days. On one point, both groups were united. They did not allow women to perform during the Aradhana. In those days, the only women who sang or danced in public were the &quot;devadasi&quot; or temple performers. Another point in common between the two groups was that they did not permit nadaswaram performances.

Bangalore Nagarathnamma was precisely such a temple performer, and one of the most famous professional concert artistes of her era. Nagarathnamma, who was then residing in Madras, was an ardent devotee of Thyagaraja and an aficionado of his music. Indeed, the soulful rendition of his &quot;kritis&quot; had been the mainstay of her career throughout her life, and she considered that she owed her considerable wealth to his grace. In 1921, the aged and childless lady decided to dedicate her life&#x27;s earnings to preserving Thyagaraja&#x27;s legacy and perpetuating his memory. In 1925, she began the construction of a temple enclosing the memorial. According to some sources, she purchased the land on which the grave stood, whereas according to other sources, that land was &quot;panchayat&quot; riverside land (village common land), and her construction was illegal, but tolerated by local residents due to its pious intentions. Nagarathnamma also had an idol of Tyagaraja sculpted and installed in front of the memorial. The consecration of the temple took place in early 1926. The two rival groups, while not interfering with all this, refused to let Nagarathnamma perform her music, or even &quot;Harikatha,&quot; within the temple which she herself had had constructed. They cited several instances from Thyagaraja&#x27;s songs where he had complained about women in general.

Undeterred, Nagarathnammal began a third front which conducted its own music programs at the rear of the shrine. This third event featured many women artistes, and perhaps for that very reason, it began eating into the public popularity of the events hosted by the two Katchis. The doughty lady also filed suits in the local courts demanding the prevention of the Katchis from entering the temple, claiming that it belonged to her by right. She lost the case, but the hours of worship were laid down by the courts, dividing the Aradhana day equally between the two Katchis and her own group.

Matters continued this way till 1940, when SY Krishnaswami, ICS, convinced the groups to unite and it was in 1941 that the Aradhana as we know it was first conducted. Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar selected the five pancharatnas as being best suited for group rendering, so that a common homage by all musicians became possible. This idea was adopted and the choral rendition of the five songs was made an integral feature of the Aradhana. Before 1941, the three separate events had all been in the nature of music festivals, with no restriction regarding which of Thyagaraja&#x27;s songs could be performed. It was only in 1941, when the three events were merged into one, that the convention of group singing of the five &quot;pancharatna kritis&quot; was decided upon.

Bangalore Nagarathnammal spent the rest of her days in Thiruvayyaru and bequeathed all her wealth to the Thyagaraja memorial, with the stipulation that women be allowed to pay their homage without any hindrance. When she died in 1952, she was buried close to Thyagaraja&#x27;s memorial and a statue was erected on the spot. The statue directly gazes on Thyagaraja&#x27;s memorial.

A huge complex is now under construction at Thiruvaiyaru at this site to accommodate the large audience that come to the concert in ever-increasing numbers every year.

<doc id="1172114" wikidata="Q2035798" url="?curid=1172114" title="Ithaca Chasma">
<text>Ithaca Chasma is a valley (graben) of Saturn&#x27;s moon Tethys, named after the island of Ithaca, in Greece. It is up to wide, deep and long, running approximately three-quarters of the way around Tethys&#x27; circumference, making it one of the longer valleys in the Solar System. Ithaca Chasma is approximately concentric with Odysseus crater.

Ithaca Chasma may have originated when the global salt water ocean inside Tethys froze. This would have caused the surface to crack in order to accommodate the resulting increase in volume. Another hypothesis is that Ithaca Chasma is the outermost ring of the Odysseus impact basin; however the chasma is from 4 to 0.4 billion years old, making it slightly older than Odysseus.

== Discovery ==
Ithaca Chasma was discovered by Voyager 1 spacecraft on 12 November 1980 during its flyby of Saturn. However its full extent was realized only in 1981 after the Voyager 2 flyby. It was named after the island of Ithaca, in Greece.

== Geology ==
Ithaca Chasma is a giant trough system about 3 km deep and approximately confined to a great circle running through the poles of Tethys. It is approximately concentric with Odysseus impact crater—a pole of Ithaca Chasma lies only approximately 20° from it.

The chasma has a rather complex structure consisting of two narrow branches towards the south. Its exterior walls are made of multiple sub-parallel scarps and terraces. At some places the chasma has a rim standing as high as 0.5 km about the surrounding cratered plains. Its width varies from only a few kilometers at some places to more than 100 km.

The age of Ithaca Chasma is estimated to be either 4.0 or 0.4–3.3 billion years depending on chosen impact chronology. The crater counts indicate that the chasma is slightly older than Odysseus crater but much younger than the cratered plains.

== Origin ==
There are two basic hypothesis as to how Ithaca Chasma formed. One of them is that it formed as Tethys&#x27; internal global liquid salt water ocean solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking its surface to accommodate the extra volume within. Earlier craters made before Tethys solidified were probably all erased by geological activity before then.

Tethys&#x27; global subsurface ocean may have resulted from a 2:3 orbital resonance between this moon and Dione early in the Solar System&#x27;s history. The resonance would have led to orbital eccentricity and tidal heating that may have warmed Tethys&#x27; interior enough to form the ocean. Subsequent freezing of the internal ocean after the moons escaped from the resonance may have generated the extensional stresses that created Ithaca Chasma.

An alternative hypothesis is that it was formed at the same time as the large crater Odysseus which lies near a pole of the Ithaca Chasma. When the impact that created Odysseus occurred, the shockwave may have traveled through Tethys and produced a circumcircular fracture analogous to outer ring graben of multiring impact basins. However, age determination based on crater counts in high resolution Cassini images showed that Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus, making the impact hypothesis unlikely.

<text>Captain Black is the fictional nemesis of Captain Scarlet and the primary, recurring Mysteron agent in the 1960s British Supermarionation television series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and its 2005 animated remake, &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;.

&quot;Black&quot; is a codename; in the original series, the character&#x27;s real name is never revealed (although in tie-ins he is named as Conrad Turner), while in the remake the character&#x27;s tombstone indicates that his real name is Conrad Lefkon. The character&#x27;s transformation from human to Mysteron agent occurs on Mars in the first episode of each series (&quot;The Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Instrument of Destruction, Part 1&quot;).

==Depiction in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;==
===Development===
The puppet was sculpted by Christine Glanville. Originally Black was to have been killed off at the end of &quot;The Mysterons&quot;, but this idea was abandoned after Glanville altered the puppet to show that the character was under Mysteron control. According to Glanville: &quot;Once I&#x27;d painted him up to look gaunt and pallid, Gerry [Anderson] took one look and decided to keep him on as a regular.&quot;

In a 1986 interview in which he discussed his approach to writing for the series, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; script editor Tony Barwick drew parallels between the premise and characters of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and those of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; – suggesting, for example, that the Spectrum Organisation could be compared to International Rescue and that Black was similar to The Hood, the main recurring villain in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Prior to &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;″ official premiere in September 1967, Black had been referenced several times by the Century 21 comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot; in strips documenting the aftermath of the fateful &quot;Zero-X&quot; mission and the structure of the Spectrum Organisation.

===Character biography===
In 2068, Black is seconded to command the &quot;Zero-X&quot; spacecraft for a crewed mission to Mars, assigned with investigating anomalous radio signals detected by the Spectrum Organisation. Previously, Earth was aware only of the existence of rock snakes on the planet (as seen in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;); consequently, Black is alarmed to discover a fully-developed alien city on the Martian plains. When the inhabitants – a collective, intangible, artificial intelligence calling itself &quot;the Mysterons&quot; – rotate scanning apparatus towards the Martian Exploration Vehicle (MEV), Black misinterprets the attempt at peaceful first contact as preparations for an attack; believing the Mysterons to be hostile, he orders his subordinates to fire on and destroy the settlement. After using their power of &quot;reversing matter&quot; to reconstruct their city, the Mysterons condemn humanity&#x27;s unwarranted aggression and declare a retributive &quot;&quot; against Earth – the first act of which will be the assassination of the World President. As the aliens go on to state that &quot;one of you will be under our control&quot;, Black undergoes a dramatic change of appearance as he sits in the cockpit of the MEV, his expression hardening and his face becoming pale – thus, he is transformed into the primary instrument of the Mysterons&#x27; campaign of vengeance. After &quot;Zero-X&quot; returns to Earth, Black disappears.

The exact nature of Black compared to other Mysteron agents is never explicitly stated in the series. Interpretations differ: Chris Bentley states that Black is killed on Mars and replaced with an indestructible Mysteron doppelganger, while according to Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett, the unique manner of his corruption suggests that unlike the Mysterons&#x27; other victims, he was not killed and duplicated but remains alive, albeit under Mysteron control.

Through Black, the Mysterons relay instructions to their reconstructed intermediaries, while compelling him to undertake acts of murder and terrorism through their deep, disembodied voice (in which Black now also speaks). Black&#x27;s unique position is of clear importance to the Mysteron cause and thus elevates him above any of their other agents. This is evident in the episode &quot;Manhunt&quot;; after becoming a radiation hotspot through accidental exposure, he can then be tracked by Spectrum. Capturing Symphony Angel while evading their ground forces, he deliberately subjects her to radiation inside an atomic centre, but does not kill her and allows her to escape. Spectrum officers give chase to the Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle that they believe contains Black, but is in fact being driven (badly) by Symphony. His ruse a success, Black decontaminates himself and makes his escape. Captain Blue&#x27;s surprised remark of &quot;So he &quot;is&quot; alive!&quot; when he sees security camera footage of Captain Black implies that until then they thought he was dead. In various episodes, like &quot;The Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Point 783&quot;, he demonstrates the ability to filter out his voice while speaking so only other Mysteron agents can hear him.

According to text features in the comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot; and related publications, Black was born Conrad Turner in Manchester, England (though until his corruption at the start of &quot;The Mysterons&quot;, he speaks with a North American accent) and was orphaned at seven months as a result of a brief nuclear war. He was raised by distant relatives who provided little emotional support, causing him to be cold and reclusive during his adolescence. At 15, he entered Manchester Technical Academy (a chapter of the Northern University), and graduated with diplomas in physics, space navigation and international law; he then went into the Northern University and received diplomas in science and technology, all this done in three years. He joined the Royal Air Force and served in the British Civil War at the age of 18. After the country was admitted to the World Government, he achieved renown for his work in the World Army and Air Force, and later as a &quot;Fireball XL3&quot; pilot in the World Space Patrol. He was Spectrum&#x27;s first agent, and oversaw the construction of Cloudbase during the 2060s.

In the episode &quot;Treble Cross&quot;, an air force test pilot unexpectedly survives an assassination attempt by the Mysterons and aids Spectrum in another effort to apprehend Black. However, he is not deceived when the human pilot poses as his own Mysteron duplicate and evades Spectrum for a second time; Captain Blue infers that the Mysterons have equipped him with a &quot;sixth sense&quot; to warn him of danger. If under threat of imminent capture, Black is able to teleport away from danger – an action demonstrated in the episodes &quot;The Heart of New York&quot;, &quot;Model Spy&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot;.

The character is seen to wear his Spectrum uniform only in the pilot episode and in the secondary opening sequence for all episodes thereafter (in which he is shown to be standing symbolically in a moonlit graveyard). On all other occasions, he is wearing civilian clothing – typically black trousers, a black zip-up jacket and an orange sweater. This is presumably so the other Spectrum personnel cannot contact him therefore making him more inconspicuous, harder to pinpoint and aid in his elusiveness. However, he is shown wearing his uniform in various comic stories where there is no immediate demand for secrecy or when his mission would benefit from it, such as when the Mysterons took control of a robot production facility or when Black tried to manipulate an amnesic Scarlet into helping in an attack on a major conference being held to justify Spectrum&#x27;s funding.

==Depiction in &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;==

In the first episode of the remake series, Black&#x27;s encounter with the Mysterons on Mars kills him outright. After being buried on Earth, he is resurrected by the Mysterons, breaking out of his grave and thereafter acting as their agent.

There are several differences between the original Black and the version seen in the remake. For example, his surname is Lefkon (as shown on his gravestone in the first episode, &quot;Instrument of Destruction, Part 1&quot;). The voice of the new Black is the same as before Mysteronisation, save when the Mysterons assume direct control over his body. Before Mysteronisation, he is portrayed as a sympathetic character, and was in a relationship with Destiny Angel. Unlike his rash and entirely unprovoked attack on the Mysteron city in the original series, here it is given some justification by the fact that scanning equipment on board the MEV explicitly identifies the Mysteron probe as a weapon. By contrast, after his Mysteronisation he is an almost stereotypical villain, taking pleasure in the acts of murder that he commits; in one episode, he leaves Captain Scarlet chained up next to a doomsday device, complete with digital countdown. However, on some occasions (for example, in the episode &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;) Scarlet is able to educe Black&#x27;s original personality, nearly to the point of breaking the Mysterons&#x27; conditioning.

In &quot;Dominion&quot;, the series finale, Black is knocked unconscious while attempting to destroy a nuclear facility. On recovering, he claims to have been liberated from Mysteron control, and asks Scarlet to return with him to Mars to launch an attack on the Mysteron city. Although the attack is successful, the Mysterons re-assert control over Black. The final image of the series is of Black watching Scarlet&#x27;s departing spacecraft, then turning about and walking into the distance; two green rings envelop him, and Black vanishes.

According to promotional materials, Conrad Lefkon was born in Brooklyn, New York and was the son of a local crime lord, and joined the army to escape from the &quot;family business&quot;. However, in the series he speaks in an English accent, the inverse of the original show.

==Reception==
With reference to the original &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, Morgan Jeffery of website Digital Spy refers to Captain Black as being one of the series&#x27; &quot;most memorable elements&quot;, adding that the character&#x27;s Mysteronised appearance and voice &quot;were absolutely terrifying as a child. His presence, plus the high level of on-screen violence, made &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; a heady cocktail for a young, petrified viewer.&quot; Eamonn McCusker of website The Digital Fix states that Black&#x27;s vengefulness &quot;knew no limits&quot;, noting that in one episode (&quot;The Heart of New York&quot;) the character kills a gang of human bank robbers posing as Mysteron reconstructions because their &quot;impersonation [...] had aroused his ire.&quot; In contrast, Geoff Willmetts of Sfcrowsnest writes that some of Black&#x27;s actions seem &quot;humane and even against his orders&quot;, pointing out that in the episode &quot;Manhunt&quot; he abducts Symphony Angel only to spare her life and release her: &quot;Considering how easily Captain Black murdered other people to reach his masters&#x27; aims, this would seem out of character.&quot;

The character&#x27;s name has also drawn comment for its colour symbolism. In a 1976 essay titled &quot;Racism in the English Language&quot;, Robert B. Moore cited &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; as an example of black-and-white dualism, pointing out that while the character who leads the heroic Spectrum Organisation has the codename &quot;Colonel &quot;White&quot;&quot;, the malevolent Mysterons use an agent called &quot;Captain &quot;Black&quot;&quot;. Moore presented this as an example of how &quot;symbolism of white as positive and black as negative is pervasive in our culture.&quot; Daniel O&#x27;Brien, author of &quot;SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World&quot;, states that Black&#x27;s characterisation as a villain is &quot;to no one&#x27;s great surprise&quot;. When the series was repeated on BBC2 in the early 1990s, some commentators interpreted this colour opposition as having racist undertones. Gerry Anderson rejected this argument and pointed out that the series features heroic non-white characters in the form of Lieutenant Green, Melody Angel and Harmony Angel. Around this time, various newspapers reported that the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) had filed a complaint against the BBC over the alleged racism of the names; the story was repetition of a baseless rumour started by a freelance reporter and was rejected by the CRE in its annual report. On black-and-white dualism, Guyanese actor Cy Grant, who voiced Lieutenant Green and praised the series for its multiculturalism, commented that &quot;the &#x27;darkness&#x27; of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift — the struggle of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27; — of the Western world as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and light are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift.&quot;

Black has also been interpreted as part of a supposed religious allegory in the series. Grant and other commentators have compared Cloudbase (Spectrum&#x27;s airborne headquarters, protected by a fighter squadron codenamed &quot;the Angels&quot;) to Heaven, Colonel White (the head of Spectrum) to God, and the resurrected Captain Scarlet (White&#x27;s top agent) to the Son of God; Black, a Spectrum officer-turned-Mysteron agent, is viewed as either an analogue of the Devil (a fallen angel) or a Judas figure in league with the &quot;satanic&quot; Mysterons of the planet Mars (which Grant likens to Hades). Anderson denied that any of this symbolism was intentional.

<text>Arthur H. Robinson (January 5, 1915 – October 10, 2004) was an American geographer and cartographer, who was professor in the Geography Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1947 until he retired in 1980. He was a prolific writer and influential philosopher on cartography, and one of his most notable accomplishments is the Robinson projection of 1961.

==Biography==
Arthur H. Robinson was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to American parents, James Howard Robinson and Elizabeth (Peavey) Robinson. He lived in Great Britain while he was young, and received his post-secondary education in the United States. His undergraduate work was done at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, obtaining a B.A. degree in 1936. During his undergraduate work he became especially interested in cartography, and received some practice drawing maps for faculty textbooks while earning a master&#x27;s degree in geography from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1938, and he earned his Ph.D. degree from Ohio State University in 1947. While at Ohio State, Robinson worked to solve problems in the Map communication model.

During World War II, Robinson served as director of the map division of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). In 1941, when Robinson joined OSS, there were no cartographers as we know them today. Robinson engaged geographers with some interest in mapping and the group developed their techniques on the job. Led by Robinson, the OSS cartographers designed a massive 50-inch globe for President Franklin Roosevelt, which became known as &quot;The President&#x27;s Globe.&quot; A copy of the globe was given to Winston Churchill as a gift and a third globe was provided for the use of George Marshall and Henry Stimson. While serving with the OSS, Robinson oversaw the creation of 5,000 hand-drawn maps and attended the Allied conferences at Quebec and Cairo in 1943 and in 1944, he served as chief U.S. map officer. For his efforts Robinson received the Legion of Merit from the United States Army in 1946.

In 1947 Robinson subsequently joined the geography department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he spent his career in academia and research. Robinson sought to establish cartography as a recognized discipline and ultimately the university granted both undergraduate and master&#x27;s degrees in cartography. The Wisconsin cartography program has conferred more than 100 masters and 20 doctoral degrees, and many of the doctoral recipients created respected cartography programs at other universities. Today the map library at the University of Wisconsin–Madison is named in his honor.

Robinson served as president of the International Cartographic Association (1972–76), and as vice president and president of the Association of American Geographers. He was awarded the Carl Mannerfelt Gold Medal by the International Cartographic Association in 1980.

==Personal life==
Robinson married Mary Elizabeth Coffin (1910–-1992), daughter of John R. Coffin and Bessie Morris Coffin, on December 23, 1938, in Franklin County, Ohio. They had two children, a son and a daughter. After the death of his first wife, Robinson remarried in 1993. His second wife was Martha Elizabeth Rodabaugh Phillips (1914–2010), a widow, with whom he had attended school in Oxford, Ohio.

==Work==
Robinson was a prolific writer and influential philosopher on cartography: According to Robinson, “the aim of cartographic design is to present the geographical data in such a fashion that the map, as a whole, appears as an integrated unit and so that each item included is clear, legible, and neither more nor less prominent than it should be.” Like Richard Edes Harrison, another successful wartime cartographer, Robinson warned against the dangers of blindly accepting conventions in map design, such as always putting north at the top of the map. Robinson wrote that neither logic nor educational value required placing north at the top of the map.
* In &quot;The Look of Maps&quot; (1952) which was based on his doctoral research, Robinson urged cartographers to consider the function of a map as an integral part of the design process.
* In the text &quot;In The Nature of Maps&quot; (1976), Robinson and co-author Barbara Bartz Petchenik created the term map percipient, a map user who interacts with a map in a discerning way and not merely as a casual observer. The authors stressed that &quot;... the nature of the map as an image and the manner in which it functions as a communication device between the cartographer and percipient need much deeper consideration and analysis than they have yet received.&quot;
* Robinson also co-authored a widely used textbook, &quot;Elements of Cartography&quot;, the sixth and last edition of which was published in 1995.

===Robinson projection===

One of Robinson&#x27;s most notable accomplishments is the Robinson projection. In 1961, Rand McNally asked Robinson to choose a projection for use as a world map that, among other criteria, was uninterrupted, had limited distortion, and was pleasing to the eye of general viewers. Robinson could not find a projection that satisfied the criteria, so Rand McNally commissioned him to design one.

Robinson proceeded through an iterative process to create a pseudo-cylindrical projection that intends to strike a compromise between distortions in areas and in distances, in order to attain a more natural visualization. The projection has been widely used since its introduction. In 1988, National Geographic adopted it for their world maps but replaced it in 1998 with the Winkel tripel projection.

<doc id="1172126" wikidata="Q11057232" url="?curid=1172126" title="Land of Dreams (Randy Newman album)">
<text>Land of Dreams is the eighth studio album by Randy Newman. Released in 1988, the album features vignettes of his childhood in New Orleans.

==Reception==
It placed 10th in the 1988 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll. &quot;Whether or not [&#x27;Dixie Flyer&#x27; and &#x27;New Orleans&#x27;] are simple autobiography, they&#x27;re presented as such,&quot; wrote Greil Marcus, &quot;and for a man who&#x27;s always sung as a character actor, it&#x27;s a shock&quot;. While &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; was the name of the train line mentioned in the lyrics, &quot;Dixie&quot; was also the nickname of Adele &quot;Dixie&quot; Fuchs/Fox, Randy Newman&#x27;s mother, who, as the song describes, came from a southern Jewish family.

==Chart performance==
The album&#x27;s single &quot;It&#x27;s Money That Matters&quot; rose to the top of the Mainstream Rock chart for two weeks (and peaked at No. 60 on the Hot 100), to become Newman&#x27;s only number one hit on any U.S. chart; it features Mark Knopfler on guitar. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the song &quot;Something Special&quot; was closing title music for the 1987 MGM production &quot;Overboard&quot; starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and was also featured in the trailer of the film &quot;Awakenings&quot;, for which Newman also wrote the music, and the piano bridge from the song &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; would subsequently often be utilized as break or filler music, most notably on the &quot;Car Talk&quot; radio program. The song &quot;Falling in Love&quot; features in the credits to the 1989 Tom Selleck film &quot;Her Alibi&quot; and was used as the opening theme of the short-lived 1990 ABC sitcom, &quot;The Marshall Chronicles&quot;.

<text>Feng Kang (; September 9, 1920 – August 17, 1993) was a Chinese mathematician. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980. After his death, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Feng Kang Prize in 1994 to reward young Chinese researchers who made outstanding contributions to computational mathematics.

==Early life and education==
Feng was born in Nanjing, China and spent his childhood in Suzhou, Jiangsu. He studied at Suzhou High School. In 1939 he was admitted to Department of Electrical Engineering of the National Central University (Nanjing University). Two years later he transferred to the Department of Physics where he studied until his graduation in 1944. He became interested in mathematics and studied it at the university.

==Career==
After graduation, he contracted spinal tuberculosis and continued to learn mathematics by himself at home. Later in 1946 he went to teach mathematics at Tsinghua University. In 1951 he was appointed as assistant professor at Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 1951 to 1953 he worked at Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow, under the supervision of Professor Lev Pontryagin. In 1957 he was elected as an associate professor at Institute of Computer Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he began his work on computational mathematics and became the founder and leader of computational mathematics and scientific computing in China. In 1978 he was appointed as the first Director of the newly founded Computing Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences until 1987 when he became the Honorary Director.

==Contributions==

Feng contributed to several fields in mathematics. Before 1957 he mainly worked on pure mathematics, specially on topological groups, Lie groups and generalized function theory. From 1957 he began studying applied mathematics and computational mathematics. He made a series of discoveries in computational mathematics.

In the later 1950s and early 1960s, based on the computations of dam constructions, Feng proposed a systematic numerical technique for solving partial differential equations. The method was called the &quot;Finite difference method based on variation principles&quot; (). This method was also independently invented in the West, and is more widely known as the finite element method. It is now considered that the invention of the finite element method is a milestone of computational mathematics.

In the 1970s Feng developed embedding theories in discontinuous finite element space, and generalized classical theory on elliptic partial differential equations to various dimensional combinations, which provided a mathematical foundation for elastic composite structures. He also worked on reducing elliptic PDEs to boundary integral equations, which led to the development of the natural boundary element method, now regarded as one of three main boundary element methods. Since 1978 he had given lectures and seminars on finite elements and natural boundary elements in more than ten universities and institutes in France, Italy, Japan and United States.

From 1984 Feng changed his research field from elliptic PDEs to dynamical systems such as Hamiltonian systems and wave equations. He proposed symplectic algorithms for Hamiltonian systems. Such algorithms preserve the symplectic geometric structure of Hamiltonian systems. He led a research group which worked on symplectic algorithms for solving Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite dimensions, and also on dynamical systems with Lie algebraic structures, such as contact systems and source-free systems. Since these algorithms make use of the corresponding geometry and the underlying Lie algebras and Lie groups, they are superior to conventional algorithms in long term tracking and qualitative simulation in many practical applications, such as celestial mechanics and molecular dynamics.

<doc id="1172152" wikidata="Q1088671" url="?curid=1172152" title="Chrysler Europe">
<text>Chrysler Europe was the American automotive company Chrysler&#x27;s operations in Europe from 1967 through 1978. It was formed from the merger of the French Simca, British Rootes and Spanish Barreiros companies. In 1978, Chrysler divested these operations to PSA Peugeot Citroën.

PSA rebadged the former Chrysler and Simca models with the revived Talbot marque, but abandoned the brand for passenger cars in 1987, although it continued on commercial vehicles until 1994.

Among the remaining Chrysler Europe assets still in existence are the former Simca factory in Poissy, the former Barreiros plant in the Madrid suburb Villaverde, which both serve as major Stellantis assembly plants, and the Rootes Group research and development complex in Whitley, Coventry, which is now the headquarters of Jaguar Land Rover.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Chrysler Corporation had never had much success outside North America, contrasting with Ford&#x27;s worldwide reach and General Motors&#x27; success with its Opel, Vauxhall, Bedford and Holden brands. Chrysler first established an interest in the French-based Simca in 1958, buying 15% of the company&#x27;s stock from Ford. In 1963, Chrysler increased their stake to a controlling 63% by purchasing further stock from Fiat.

Chrysler acquired a 35% share of the Spanish Barreiros in 1963, and it became part of Chrysler Europe in 1969. Barreiros was renamed Chrysler España, S.A. in 1970. Also in 1963, Chrysler acquired the Greek company FARCO (founded in 1961 by the Kontogouris brothers to produce the Farmobil), which it renamed Chrysler Hellas S.A. after the acquisition. However, production there ended in 1967 without much success.

After failing to acquire an interest in the British-based Leyland Motors in 1962, Chrysler bought a 30% share in Rootes Group in 1964. Rootes was formally taken over by Chrysler following purchase of the remaining shares in 1967.

In 1970, Rootes was formally named &quot;Chrysler (UK) Ltd.&quot; and Simca became &quot;Chrysler (France)&quot;, with the Hillman marque finally being replaced by Chrysler on the UK market in 1976 and Simca surviving until after the PSA takeover in 1979.

=== Branding ===
Although the original marques were retained at first, from 1976 British-built cars were badged as &#x27;Chryslers&#x27;, while the Simca badge appeared on French versions, though with the Chrysler pentastar, in some markets the cars were sold as Chrysler-Simca. Chrysler used the Dodge marque on commercial vehicles produced by both Simca and Rootes (Commer and Karrier, but in addition using rebadging to sell vehicles overseas under the Fargo and DeSoto brands). In addition, in some countries, such as Spain, the Dodge and Simca marques would be used for other vehicles, mostly Spanish-designed (ex-Barreiros) trucks and buses and locally-built versions of US-market vehicles or local versions of Simca cars.

The company systematically retired the previous marques from Rootes, including Hillman, Humber, Singer and Sunbeam in favour of the Chrysler name. The Simca brand was retained in its native France, but the Simca vehicles themselves were usually branded as either Chrysler-Simca or simply Chrysler outside France. In 1969, Chrysler Europe closed a deal with French engineering group Matra Automobiles to jointly develop Matra sports cars and subsequently sell them through the Simca dealer network (as Matra-Simca). Following the introduction of the 1970 Avenger, Chrysler showed little investment or interest in the technologically conservative Rootes line-up, concentrating instead on the advanced front wheel drive Simca models instead.

===Decline and sale to Peugeot===

Confused branding resulted from trying to concurrently sell the mismatched pairing of the Simca and Rootes product families, contrasting heavily with the fortunes of arch rivals Ford and General Motors – who had both successfully managed to weave together their previously independent British and German subsidiaries. Chrysler Europe profits failed to materialize, although Simca on its own had been consistently profitable during its tenure under Chrysler ownership. It was the ailing former Rootes Group operations which were to prove to be the ultimate downfall of the company. Chrysler was already in serious financial trouble back home in America, and were on the brink of bankruptcy. The company&#x27;s incoming CEO, Lee Iacocca, had shown little interest in the European market from the outset (just as he had done during his period in charge of Ford), and wasted no time in wielding the axe almost immediately.

In 1978, Chrysler Europe was sold for a nominal US$1 () to PSA Peugeot Citroën, who took on the liability for its huge debts as well as its factories and product line, with the former Chrysler models in Britain and Simca models in France both using the revived Talbot marque from August 1979.

The Linwood factory in Scotland was closed by Peugeot in 1981 after just 18 years in use, marking the end of Avenger and Sunbeam production. The Sunbeam was replaced by the Peugeot 104 derived, French-built Talbot Samba, but the demise of the Avenger left the Horizon as the only car of its size in the Talbot range. The Alpine spawned a saloon version, the Solara, in 1980, filling the gap left in the range by the demise of the Hunter, and recognising that there was still a high demand for traditional family saloons.

But by 1987, the French giant had scrapped the Talbot marque on passenger cars due to falling sales – though retaining it for commercial vehicles until 1992. The car designed to succeed the Horizon became the Peugeot 309 on its launch at the end of 1985, and in 1983, Peugeot sold the shares in Matra Automobiles it had inherited when it acquired Chrysler Europe back to Matra and a Chrysler-initiated design of an MPV to Renault, where the design lived on as the Renault Espace. Production of the Samba and Alpine/Solara finished in May 1986, while the Horizon remained in production in Spain and Finland until 1987; French and British production had finished during 1985 when the Peugeot 309 went into production. American versions of this car were produced until 1990.

Peugeot took little interest in heavy commercial vehicles and the production of former British and Spanish Dodge models passed to Renault Trucks. The Rootes factory in Dunstable, England ceased manufacture of trucks, ending with the Renault Midliner in the mid-1990s. In 2009, the staff of Renault Trucks, part of the Volvo Group since 2001, relocated from the former Rootes site to a new building. The former factory has since been demolished.

Chrysler, on the other hand, retained the design rights to the Avenger and those of the US-version Horizon. Peugeot was therefore compelled to retain the Chrysler &quot;Pentastar&quot; badge on the Avenger, whilst allowing Chrysler to sell the design along with its entire operations in Argentina to Volkswagen which continued production until 1991 under the Volkswagen 1500 name. 
For the New Zealand market, the Avenger kept the Chrysler branding for 1980 after being rebranded elsewhere. 
Meanwhile, European sales of the Avenger ended in 1981. The American version of the Horizon continued to be produced in the United States as the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni until 1990, three years after the last European model was made.

The former Simca and Rootes assembly plants in Poissy and Ryton-on-Dunsmore, respectively, continued under the ownership of Peugeot, but Rootes&#x27; Linwood plant in Scotland was a casualty of the takeover – closing its doors in 1981. The former Rootes Ryton plant was closed in December 2006, with the production of the Peugeot 206 (made there since the summer of 1998) moved to Slovakia. Since 1985, it had also produced Peugeot&#x27;s 309, 405 and 306 ranges. It has since been demolished to make way for new factories. The former Rootes research and development site in Whitley was sold to Jaguar in 1986, and continues as the headquarters of Jaguar Land Rover to the present day. The former Simca site in Poissy has also thrived, and is now one Peugeot&#x27;s most important assembly plants.

Decades after the sale, in 2021 Peugeot and Chrysler (the latter of which became part of Fiat in 2009 after another financial crisis led to its bankruptcy) fell under the same corporate umbrella when the now-Groupe PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to form Stellantis, which has once again seen Peugeot branded vehicles produced in the United Kingdom (this time in a Vauxhall plant - thanks to PSA&#x27;s earlier purchase of General Motors Europe), and European designs marketed through Chrysler&#x27;s distribution channels in the United States.

===Cars===
CKD assembly of various American Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler models took place at Chrysler&#x27;s own Rotterdam factory until its closure in 1970, and Barreiros (later part of Chrysler Europe) assembled the Dodge Dart in Villaverde (Madrid) from 1965 to 1970, followed under Chrysler ownership by the revised Dodge 3700 (1970–77). In Switzerland AMAG had also assembled various American Chrysler and Dodge models between 1948 and 1972, the most popular model being the Chrysler Valiant. None of these models sold in large quantities because even &#x27;compact&#x27; American cars of that period were too large and fuel-thirsty to sell well in the European market.

Inherited Rootes and Simca car models still in production beyond 1967 were:
* Hillman Imp (1963–76) and its various badge-engineered derivatives: the Hillman Husky, Singer Chamois/Imp/Sport, Sunbeam Imp/Stiletto and Commer Imp van
* Hillman Hunter (1966–76) and its derivatives: the Hillman Minx, Humber Sceptre, Singer Gazelle/Vogue and Sunbeam Vogue. Later rebadged as the Chrysler Hunter (1976–79).
* Sunbeam Rapier/Alpine coupé (1967–76)
* Sunbeam Alpine roadster (1959–68)
* Simca 1000 (1961–78)
* Simca 1000 Coupé/1200S (1962–71)
* Simca 1100/1200/1204 (1962–82, vans to 1985). Van and pick-up versions were rebadged as Dodges for the British market 1976–79, and all models were badged as Talbots for Britain after 1979.
* Simca 1301/1501 (1963–75)

The first new European Chrysler was the large Chrysler 180 range (1970–82), including the 160 and 2 Litre. The 180 was the result of combining two projects that were previously being developed independently by Rootes and Simca as successors to their largest models (the Humber Hawk/Super Snipe and Simca Vedette, which had been discontinued in 1967 and 1961 respectively). This was the flagship model in the Chrysler Europe range, and it was the first European designed model to use the Chrysler name, which it was intended to establish as a premium marque above Simca and Humber. The 180 was intended to rival the likes of Audi 100 and Ford Granada during the 1970s, although unlike its competitors it was only available with 4-cylinder engines and lacked a prestige image. It was initially built in France, but due to disappointing sales its assembly was transferred to Spain as a successor to the Dodge 3700 in a market where protectionist trade policies guaranteed it some domestic sales. From 1977, the 180 was sold as a &#x27;Chrysler-Simca&#x27; in most European markets (except Britain), and after the sale of Chrysler Europe to PSA it was rebadged again as a Talbot.

Also launched in 1970 was the Hillman Avenger (1970-81), a medium-sized family car which fitted between the Imp and the Hunter in Chrysler&#x27;s British range. The model sold well in Britain but was less successful in export markets, where it was sold under a variety of names including Sunbeam/Sunbeam Avenger/Chrysler Sunbeam (Europe) and Plymouth Cricket (North America). The Avenger was originally assembled at the Ryton plant (displacing the Hunter to Linwood), but a mid-life facelift in 1976 coincided with Avenger assembly moving to Linwood as the Chrysler Avenger. from 1979 it was renamed the Talbot Avenger following the sale of Chrysler Europe to PSA.

The British car designer Roy Axe, who originally started his career with Rootes, was responsible for unifying the designs of the new European range starting with the Simca 1307 (1975–86) family hatchback, which was sold in the UK as the Chrysler Alpine. The new pan-European model was assembled in France, Spain and Britain, and was voted European Car of the Year for 1976. Other influential designers who worked for the company in the 1970s and had a significant impact in car design in the 1980s were Geoff Matthews, Peter Horbury and Fergus Pollock. From this &#x27;70s period, two outstanding projects were the Matra P18 prototype, which would later be developed into the MK1 Renault Espace and the Matra Rancho, which influenced the styling of the 1989 Land Rover Discovery.

The 1307/Alpine was a five-door hatchback with front-wheel drive, in a market sector which was still almost exclusively populated by rear-wheel drive saloons like the Ford Cortina/Taunus and Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier. Therefore, although the new 1307 replaced the conventional Simca 1301 model, in the UK Chrysler decided to keep the Hillman Hunter (a rear-wheel drive range of saloons and estates) in limited production as a traditional alternative to the Alpine. Introduction of the Alpine in 1976 required a complicated reorganisation of Chrysler&#x27;s British assembly operations, with the Alpine replacing the Avenger at Ryton, Avenger assembly moving to Linwood replacing the Imp, Hunter, Sceptre and Rapier, and the residual Hunter assembly moving to a CKD operation in Ireland. The Avenger and Hunter were both facelifted at this time and re-badged as Chryslers. Production of the Chrysler Hunter finished in 1979 just after Peugeot took over, although the tooling was subsequently sold to Iran as the Paykan, which was built until 2005.

To replace the small Hillman Imp at the under-utilised Linwood plant, the British Government provided grants for the development of the Chrysler Sunbeam (1977–81), a three-door supermini hatchback based on a shortened Avenger floorplan. In contrast to the advanced Alpine the Sunbeam was rear-wheel drive and therefore somewhat dated compared to contemporary superminis such as the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo, and it was rarely seen outside the UK. It was renamed the Talbot Sunbeam in 1979.

The Matra Rancho (1977–84) was a leisure activity vehicle version of the Simca 1100 developed by the French automotive engineering firm Matra Automobiles in partnership with Chrysler Europe. Although a low-volume niche model based on an ageing car, it proved to be a sales success and can be viewed as a very early example of what would now be classified as a crossover vehicle.

The last new model launched before the demise of Chrysler Europe was the Chrysler Horizon (1978–87), which was also sold as the Chrysler-Simca Horizon and soon renamed the Talbot Horizon in 1979. Like the larger Alpine, the Horizon was another pan-European model built simultaneously in France, Spain and the UK (Ryton, from 1980), and it also won the European Car of the Year Award for 1979. The Horizon was a five-door front-wheel drive hatchback similar in concept to the Volkswagen Golf. Chrysler continued to make its own versions of the Horizon in its American factories after withdrawing from Europe, and production continued there until 1990.

Although the preceding Simca 1100 was front-wheel drive, at the time the Horizon was launched many comparable cars were still sold as rear-wheel drive saloons, so the Chrysler/Talbot Avenger was kept in production alongside to cater for more traditional buyers.

Prior to the sale of Chrysler Europe to Peugeot in 1978, Chrysler had begun development of a large flagship saloon as a replacement for the slow-selling 180/2 Litre range, to compete with cars like the Ford Granada and raise the image of the Chrysler brand. This car would eventually be launched in 1980 as the Talbot Tagora under Peugeot&#x27;s ownership. However this model was not a strong seller either, and finished production after just three years and less than 20,000 sales.

Peugeot added a saloon version of the Alpine - the Talbot Solara (1980–86) - to the former Chrysler range, and also made use of its own Peugeot 104 underpinnings to develop the Talbot Samba (1981–86) supermini as the Sunbeam&#x27;s replacement. However, thereafter there would be no new Talbot models. The rear-drive Talbot Sunbeam and Avenger and were axed when the Linwood plant closed in 1981. Peugeot continued production of the Talbot Samba, Alpine and Solara until 1986, and the Horizon until 1987, but then phased out the Talbot brand in favour of expanding its own brand by producing new Peugeot models in the former Rootes factory near Coventry and the former Simca plant at Poissy.

===Vans and Trucks===
Chrysler had developed its own line of British-built trucks which were assembled at its Kew (London) factory until 1967, when the former Chrysler and Rootes commercial vehicle ranges were merged, with production consolidated at the former Rootes plant at Dunstable. Chrysler also inherited a separate truck range from Barreiros in Spain.

The naming of Chrysler Europe&#x27;s commercial vehicles was particularly complicated due to the proliferation of badge-engineering. Chrysler&#x27;s own range of British trucks were sold as Dodges (or Dodge Kew, to differentiate from American models) in Britain, but in some export markets they were badged DeSoto or Fargo. Rootes principal commercial vehicle brand was Commer, but the Karrier name was also used, especially for lighter trucks and for vehicles sold to municipal customers. After Chrysler acquired Rootes, some former Commer models became available as Dodges and Fargos, while the Dodge 500 also became available as a Commer. Outside France, the van and pick-up derivatives of the Simca 1100 were also marketed under the Dodge brand. From 1976 all of the commercial vehicles were marketed as Dodges, apart from a few municipal vehicles which were still branded as Karriers. After sale of the commercial vehicle operations to Renault the Dodge name continued to be used until 1987, when the remaining Dodge models were re-branded as Renaults.

Excluding badge-engineered derivatives, Chrysler Europe&#x27;s British-built commercial vehicle range comprised:

* Commer 1500/Dodge SpaceVan (1960–83), van/minibus/pickup/chassis-cab
* Commer/Dodge Walk-Thru (1961–79), delivery van/chassis-cab
* Dodge 50 (1979–92), successor to Walk-Thru (launched after sale of Chrysler Europe)
* Karrier Bantam, light truck
* Commer V-series/Karrier Gamecock, light/medium truck
* Commer C-series, medium truck
* Commer Commando/Dodge 100 (1970–89), successor to previous Karrier/Commer light/medium trucks
* Dodge 500/K-series, medium/heavy truck

The Spanish-built heavy truck range inherited from Barreiros were rebranded Dodge 300 in the 1970s, and continued in production until re-branded as Renaults in the 1980s.

==Locations==

Chrysler UK had several plants in Coventry, including the Ryton assembly plant, the Stoke Aldermoor engine plant, the design, engineering and development site at Whitley and Hills Precision, the plastics factory in Canterbury Street, as well as the vehicle manufacturing plant at Linwood in Scotland.

<doc id="1172155" wikidata="Q1174530" url="?curid=1172155" title="David Gelston">
<text>David Gelston (July 4, 1744 – August 21, 1828) was an American merchant and politician.

==Early life==
Gelston was born on July 4, 1744, in Bridgehampton in Suffolk County on Long Island in what was then the Province of New York. He was a son of Deacon Maltby Gelston and Mary (née Jones) Gelston. His maternal grandparents were Dr. Thomas Jones and Margaret (née Livingston) Jones (a daughter of Philip Livingston).

==Career==
As the American Revolution approached, Gelston became politically active. He signed the Articles of Association in 1774, agreeing to avoid British imports, even though this hurt his own business. He represented Suffolk County in the New York Provincial Congress of 1775 to 1777, as well as the 1777 New York State Constitutional Convention that debated and enacted the first constitution of the State of New York. He was a Democratic-Republican and he worked closely with Aaron Burr.

He was a member from Suffolk County of the New York State Assembly from 1777 to 1785. During his last term, he was Speaker. As speaker, he took a leading role in reconciling the differences between Tory and Whig factions. He oversaw the repeal of all the laws that had imposed civil and legal penalties on Tories.

In 1787, he removed to New York City, and from 1787 to 1801, was Surrogate of New York County. In 1789, the State Assembly appointed him a delegate to the last session of the Continental Congress. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1791 to 1794, and from 1798 to 1802.

In 1801, Gelston was appointed Collector of the Port of New York by President Thomas Jefferson, and held that post until 1821 when he retired.

==Personal life==
Gelston was married to Pheobe Mitchell (1753–1836). Together, they were the parents of:

* Pheobe Gelston (1771–1836), who married Nicoll Floyd, the son of William Floyd.
* Maltby Gelston (1772–1860), who was a member of the New York State Assembly and who served as president of the Bank of the Manhattan Company.

It was during 1792, that Charles Willson Peale was commissioned by Gelston, a notable American during the time, to paint a &quot;head size&quot; portrait of Gelston as well as a companion piece of his wife and daughter. This painting is currently displayed at the La Salle Art Museum.

Gelston died on August 21, 1828, in New York City. He was buried in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in New York.

<doc id="1172160" wikidata="Q1386456" url="?curid=1172160" title="John Tate (boxer)">
<text>John Tate (January 29, 1955 – April 9, 1998) was an American professional boxer, and held the WBA heavyweight championship from 1979 to 1980. As an amateur he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He scored notable victories over future Heavyweight Champion Gerrie Coetzee as well as beating number three ranked heavyweight Kallie Knoetze in 1979 and knocking out contender Bernardo Mercado and fringe contender Duane Bobick. 

==Amateur career==
&quot;Big John&quot; Tate (named due to his height) captured a bronze medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, losing to Olympic boxing legend Teófilo Stevenson in a semifinal bout.

===1976 Olympic results===

*Round of 16: Defeated Andrzej Biegalski (Poland) by decision, 5–0
*Quarterfinal: Defeated Peter Hussing (West Germany) by decision, 3–2
*Semifinal: Lost to Teófilo Stevenson (Cuba) KO round 1 (was awarded bronze medal)

Tate lost in the finals of the 1975 National Golden Gloves to Emory Chapman. He lost in the quarterfinals the next year in a split decision to Michael Dokes. He avenged his loss to Dokes in the Olympic Trials by decision, and beat 1976 National AAU Champion Marvin Stinson to advance to the Olympic team. He also beat future heavyweight champion Greg Page by two close decisions, one in the quarterfinals of the 1975 National Golden Gloves tournament.

Tate met his future trainer, Ace Miller, during an amateur tournament in Knoxville, Tennessee. Tate and Miller worked together through 1983.

==Professional career==
Tate turned pro in 1977 and scored a series of high-profile wins, knocking out highly ranked contenders Duane Bobick, Bernardo Mercado, and Kallie Knoetze. He captured the vacant WBA title on October 20, 1979, by defeating Gerrie Coetzee by decision, succeeding Muhammad Ali, who had relinquished the title that summer. Tate&#x27;s fights with Knoetze and Coetzee were held in Apartheid South Africa, the latter before 80,000 fans.

Tate lost the title to Mike Weaver in his first defence just five months later. Tate was well ahead on all scorecards going into the 15th and final round when the big hitting Weaver landed a left hook punch to the chin that left the champion twitching unconscious on the canvas for several minutes.

Tate came back from the loss on June 20, 1980, against up and coming Trevor Berbick. This was on the undercard of the legendary fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Durán. The former champion started well, but tired throughout the bruising battle and was defeated by Berbick early in the 9th round—being knocked out by a punch that caught him on the back of the head and left him unconscious.

Tate was in the frame to challenge Larry Holmes for the heavyweight title in 1984, but the fight fell apart due to injury. Tate boxed on and off for the remainder of the 1980s but was often grossly overweight. He weighed in at an astonishing prior to losing a points decision to journeyman Noel Quarless in London, in his final fight in 1988. Tate&#x27;s professional career record was 34–3, with 23 wins by knockout.

==Unsanctioned Bouts==
In 1994 Tate had three unsanctioned fights. The Welshman David Pearce knocked him out in the third of those fights.

==Outside the ring==
Tate&#x27;s life after his championship reign was brief and troubled, suffering from a cocaine addiction during the 1980s, being convicted on petty theft and assault charges, serving time in prison, and at times panhandling on the streets of Knoxville, Tennessee. He was rumored to have ballooned to over in his post-fighting years.

==Death==
On April 9, 1998, Tate died of injuries sustained following a one-car automobile accident. It was determined that he suffered a massive stroke, caused by a brain tumor, while driving. The pickup truck crashed into a utility pole. Two other passengers were not seriously injured.

<text>A biaxial nematic is a spatially homogeneous liquid crystal with three distinct optical axes. This is to be contrasted to a simple nematic, which has a single preferred axis, around which the system is rotationally symmetric. The symmetry group of a biaxial nematic is formula_1 i.e. that of a rectangular right parallelepiped, having 3 orthogonal formula_2 axes and three orthogonal mirror planes. In a frame co-aligned with optical axes the second rank order parameter tensor, the so-called Q tensor of a biaxial nematic has the form 
:formula_3

where formula_4 is the standard nematic scalar order parameter and formula_5 is a measure of the biaxiality. 

The first report of a thermotropic biaxial nematic appeared in 2004 based on a boomerang shaped oxadiazole bent-core mesogen. The biaxial nematic phase for this particular compound only occurs at temperatures around 200 °C and is preceded by as yet unidentified smectic phases.

It is also found that this material can segregate into chiral domains of opposite handedness. For this to happen the boomerang shaped molecules adopt a helical superstructure.

In one azo bent-core mesogen a thermal transition is found from a uniaxial Nu to a biaxial nematic Nb mesophase, as predicted by theory and simulation. This transition is observed on heating from the Nu phase with Polarizing optical microscopy as a change in Schlieren texture and increased light transmittance and from x-ray diffraction as the splitting of the nematic reflection. The transition is a second order transition with low energy content and therefore not observed in differential scanning calorimetry. The positional order parameter for the uniaxial nematic phase is 0.75 to 1.5 times the mesogen length and for the biaxial nematic phase 2 to 3.3 times the mesogen length.

Another strategy towards biaxial nematics is the use of mixtures of classical rodlike mesogens and disklike discotic mesogens. The biaxial nematic phase is expected to be located below the minimum in the rod-disk phase diagram. In one study a miscible system of rods and disks is actually found although the biaxial nematic phase remains elusive.

<text>The stratum basale (basal layer, sometimes referred to as stratum germinativum) is the deepest layer of the five layers of the epidermis, the external covering of skin in mammals.

The stratum basale is a single layer of columnar or cuboidal basal cells. The cells are attached to each other and to the overlying stratum spinosum cells by desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. The nucleus is large, ovoid and occupies most of the cell. Some basal cells can act like stem cells with the ability to divide and produce new cells, and these are sometimes called basal keratinocyte stem cells. Others serve to anchor the epidermis glabrous skin (hairless), and hyper-proliferative epidermis (from a skin disease).

They divide to form the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum, which migrate superficially. Other types of cells found within the stratum basale are melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) and Merkel cells (touch receptors).

==Clinical significance==
Basal-cell carcinomas (basal-cell cancers), account for around 80 per cent of all skin cancers. Not all basal-cell cancers originate in the basal cells but they are so named because the cancer cells resemble basal cells when seen under a microscope.

In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying papillary layer of the dermis, resulting in the formation of the ridges on the fingers. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do not change with the growth and aging processes.

<doc id="1172170" wikidata="Q296160" url="?curid=1172170" title="Association for Supply Chain Management">
<text>The Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) is a not-for-profit international educational organization offering certification programs, training tools, and networking opportunities to increase workplace performance. Formed in 1957, it was originally known as the &quot;American Production and Inventory Control Society&quot; or APICS. The mission of the organization is to advance end-to-end supply chain management. APICS merged with the Supply Chain Council in 2014, and the American Society of Transportation and Logistics in 2015. In 2018, APICS renamed itself ASCM. 

==History==

In 1957, 20 production control managers from various industries formed the American Production and Inventory Control Society. The organization later became an international association known as APICS. The organization offers certification programs, training tools, and networking opportunities for the purpose of increasing workplace performance in supply chain.

The Supply Chain Council (SCC) merged into APICS on 5 August 2014. APICS also merged with the American Society of Transportation and Logistics (AST&amp;L) in 2015. The organization renamed itself the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) in 2018 but retains APICS as a brand within the organization. 

=== The historical Supply Chain Council ===
The Supply Chain Council (SCC) was formed in 1996 as an independent non-profit organization by industry research firm AMR Research (AMR) and consulting firm Pitiglio, Rabin, Todd and McGrath (PRTM), with membership made up of a variety of industries, including manufacturing, service, distribution, and retailing. The Council&#x27;s original mission was to define a common language to describe and model supply chains. SCC developed the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model for supply chain management. The original framework for the SCOR model was developed by AMR and PRTM and vetted with industry-leading companies including Intel, IBM, Rockwell Semiconductor, and Procter and Gamble. The original model was designed to describe supply chains in four basic processes: Plan, Source, Make, and Deliver. The Return process was added later to accommodate remanufacturing industries and e-commerce. The Enable process was added last to support managing and improving various aspects of supply chain operations.

==Certifications==
ASCM offers several professional designations: CPIM, CSCP, CLTD, and CTSC. Additional certificate programs have been created, including the Supply Chain Procurement Certificate, the Supply Chain Warehousing Certificate, the Supply Chain Planning Certificate, the Supply Chain Technology Certificate, and the Supply Chain Resilience Certificate.

===CPIM===
The APICS Certified in Production and Inventory Management, or APICS CPIM, designation is a professional certification offered by ASCM. The program was founded in 1973. Since its inception, more than 100,000 people have earned the APICS CPIM designation. APICS CPIM designees learn terminology, concepts, and strategies related to demand management, procurement and supplier planning, material requirements planning, capacity requirements planning, sales and operations planning, master scheduling, performance measurements, supplier relationships, quality control, and continuous improvement.

ASCM now offers the APICS Certified in Planning and Inventory Management (CPIM) designation, which places a greater focus on planning than production. 

===CSCP===
The APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional, or APICS CSCP, designation demonstrates professional knowledge and organizational skills for developing more streamlined operations. Since its launch in 2006, more than 30,000 professionals in 100 countries have earned the CSCP designation.

===CLTD===
The APICS Certified in Logistics, Transportation and Distribution, or APICS CLTD, designation demonstrates in-depth knowledge of a range of supply chain logistics topics. More than 1,000 professionals have earned their CLTDs since the program launched in 2016.

===CTSC===
The APICS Certified in Transformation for Supply Chain, or CTSC, program leverages components of globally recognized industry standards, including the ASCM SCOR Digital Standard (DS), Enterprise Standards for Sustainability, and the Digital Capabilities Model (DCM) to help individuals transform their organization&#x27;s supply chain
=== SRM ===
The Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) certificate program is self-paced and offers several trainings from supplier relationship management to propelling continuous movement through the supply chain. The program is geared towards all levels of professionals working in the management of supply chain and procurement.

==Publications==
ASCM has moved to a digital content publishing strategy. Published articles can be found on ASCM.org or as part of a members-only benefit through its online Supply Chain Knowledge Center platform.

ASCM also owns the &quot;Journal of Operations Management&quot; and the &quot;Transportation Journal&quot;, published through Wiley Publishing.

ASCM also publishes the Supply Chain Dictionary. The 17th edition includes 5,328 terms and definitions, 483 of which are new terms compiled by industry.

&quot;SCM Now&quot; was previously the official print publication of the organization which was also formerly called &quot;APICS&quot; magazine.

<doc id="1172172" wikidata="Q2001596" url="?curid=1172172" title="Singer Motors">
<text>Singer Motors Limited was a British motor vehicle manufacturing business, originally a bicycle manufacturer founded as Singer &amp; Co by George Singer, in 1874 in Coventry, England. Singer &amp; Co&#x27;s bicycle manufacture continued. From 1901 George Singer&#x27;s Singer Motor Co made cars and commercial vehicles.

Singer Motor Co was the first motor manufacturer to make a small economy car that was a replica of a large car, showing a small car was a practical proposition. It was much more sturdily built than otherwise similar cyclecars. With its four-cylinder ten horsepower engine the Singer Ten was launched at the 1912 Cycle and Motor Cycle Show at Olympia. William Rootes, a Singer apprentice at the time of its development and consummate car-salesman, contracted to buy 50, the entire first year&#x27;s supply. It became a best-seller. Ultimately, Singer&#x27;s business was acquired by his Rootes Group in 1956, which continued the brand until 1970, a few years following Rootes&#x27; acquisition by the American Chrysler corporation.

==History==

===Bicycles===
George Singer began his bicycle-making business in Coventry in 1874.
At the time, he was foreman of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company, from which he resigned. He was joined in the business by J. E. Stringer, his brother-in-law. It appears Singer was inspired to produce a bicycle safer than the Ordinary (penny-farthing) type standard at the time, by cyclist George Dominy. Singer did not alter the large front and small rear wheel design of the Ordinary, but by raking the front forks (a first) did make it safer. He patented the design on 24 October 1878.

He followed this with an 1879 model having a large rear wheel and small front wheels which could be folded aside. and in 1885 with a tricycle, rear wheels driven by chain, which also featured a handbrake (designed by Singer and his associate, R. H. Lea) on the rear axle.

In about 1888, Singer introduced the Rational, a diamond-framed model with wheels the same size, each about diameter. It also offered removable handlebars and removable rear wheel. While safer, its performance suffered. Nevertheless, it proved popular with cycle tourers.

In 1895, Singer Cycle faced a £600,000 &quot;floatation by that egregious company promoter&quot; Terah Hooley, but survived. It also weathered an industry slump in 1898 that wiped out many British bicycle makers.

Singer Cycle Company began producing motor cars in 1901.

===Engines, three-wheelers and motorcycles===
Singer Cycle began motor vehicle production in 1901, purchasing the manufacturing rights to the Perks &amp; Birch Motor Wheel, a one-cylinder engine contained in a spoked aluminium wheel, known as a motorwheel. It was a four-stroke designed by former Beeston employees Edwin Perks and Frank Birch. A unique feature was that the engine, fuel tank, carburettor and low-tension magneto were all housed in a two-sided cast alloy spoked wheel. It was probably the first motor bicycle to be provided with magneto ignition. It was perhaps the only motorcycle engine of its era with reliable ignition. These were fitted to bicycles. The design was used by Singer &amp; Co in the rear wheel and then the front wheel of a trike.

In 1904, he developed a range of more conventional motorcycles which included 346 cc two strokes and, from 1911, side-valve models of 299 cc and 535 cc. In 1913 Singer &amp; Co offered an open-frame ladies model.

Singer &amp; Co stopped building motorcycles at the outbreak of the First World War.

===Motorcycle racing===
In 1909, Singer &amp; Co built a series of racers and roadsters and entered several bikes in races, including the Isle of Man Senior TT in 1914. George E. Stanley broke the one-hour record at Brooklands race track on a Singer motorcycle in 1912, becoming the first ever rider of a 350 cc motorcycle to cover over in an hour.

===Motor cars===

Singer&#x27;s first tricar was the Tri-Voiturette. It was powered by a engine, and offered in two models, the No. 1 (passenger facing backward) and Mo. 2 (passenger facing forward); both fitted the passenger seat well behind the rear axle.

At the 1902 Cordingly Show, at the Islington Agricultural Hall, Singer showed two commercial variants of the Tri-Voiturette, the Motor Carrier, one for tradesmen, one for dairymen.

The Tri-Voiturette was replaced by another tricar, which had two front wheels and a driven rear, more horsepower, and a coachbuilt body, but with the passenger now in front of the driver.

Muriel Hind drove a Singer Tricar in the 1906 Land&#x27;s End to John O&#x27;Groats Trial, with aviation pioneer Hilda Hewlett as her passenger and mechanic. She also drove a tricar in the twenty four hour London to Edinburgh Trial, again with a female passenger, making good time in torrential rain.

The first Singer-designed car was the 4-cylinder 2.4-litre 12/14 of 1906. The engine was bought in from Aster.

Singer made their first four-wheel car in 1905. It was designed by Scottish engineer Alexander Craig and was a variant of a design he had done for Lea-Francis having a 2-cylinder engine.

The Craig engine was replaced in 1906 by White &amp; Poppe engines in Singer&#x27;s two light car models. These were a twin and a 12/14 four-cylinder. These were joined by a White &amp; Poppe-engined Doctor&#x27;s Brougham and two Auster-powered tourers, a 12/14 and a 20/22.

For 1907, the Lea-Francis design was dropped and a range of two-, three- and four-cylinder models was launched, using White and Poppe engines. The Aster engined models were dropped in 1909 and a new range of larger cars introduced. All cars were now White and Poppe powered.

Singer experimented with a cyclecar, powered by a transversely-mounted aircooled engine in 1911–12. Instead, the company built a light car, the Ten, which debuted in 1912 with a four-cylinder engine; its main drawback was a three-speed transmission built into the rear axle. The Ten was the company&#x27;s first big seller. The same year, two years after George Singer&#x27;s death, the &quot;bicycle wheel&quot; radiator emblem was deleted. That year&#x27;s primary product was a 16/20, powered by a White &amp; Poppe engine.

The use of their own power plants spread through the range until by the outbreak of the First World War all models except the low-volume 3.3-litre 20 hp were so equipped.

The Ten&#x27;s performance attracted interest from former racing cyclist Lionel Martin, who bought a copy right off Singer&#x27;s stand at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show. Martin gave the car a thorough going-over, improving the engine&#x27;s power and raising the top speed from . Martin set up shop in Henniker Mews, Kensington, England, tuning the four-cylinder cars, and did a robust business. This was aided by the motor racing success of Martin&#x27;s own improved Ten, in particular at the Aston Clinton hillclimb. The Ten would also be sold by William Rootes, former Singer apprentice turned dealer.

On 11 July 1914, Beatrice Blore drove a Singer Ten car up the cable track (with a gradient of 1 in 3 in places) of the Great Orme, in Llandudno, North Wales, becoming the first woman to drive up the steep and challenging headland. She was six months pregnant at the time and the drive was a publicity stunt developed by her partner George Wilkin Browne to help sell the cars at his Llandudno garage, North Wales Silver Motors. The cars were advertised for sale for £195.

Production was suspended for the First World War, then resumed afterward. Except for detail changes, the engine remained the same until the Ten ended production in 1923; the chassis was redesigned in 1921. The two-seater was priced at £395.

In 1921, Singer purchased motorcycle and cyclecar maker Coventry Premier, selling a four-wheeler of their design, powered by a water-cooled V-twin, for £250, under that name until 1924. The engine was changed to a four-cylinder Singer in 1922, but the car ceased production in 1923.

In 1922, Singer&#x27;s first six-cylinder was a of , with a dated fixed head. This new 15 used a chassis very similar to the 10&#x27;s, and had one interesting feature, a retractable luggage rack. In 1924, the 15 was offered with a Weymann fabric body. Sales of the 15 were &quot;modest&quot;.

The 10&#x27;s engine was converted to overhead valves in 1923 and monobloc, while the next year, the Ten also got a Weymann body option.

The new 10/26 replaced the older 10 in 1924. it offered a engine and modernized styling. It was offered in several models, from the £195 four-seat Popular to the £295 Saloon Limousine Del Luxe.

At the 1926 London Motor Show, the company debuted the Junior, powered by a OHV . Priced from £148 10s as a four-seat tourer, it had only rear-wheel brakes to start. A racing 10 set the Brooklands lap record in 1921 at . Meanwhile, the 10/26 became the -engined Senior, joined by the new Six, powered by a inline six based on the 10/26&#x27;s and four-wheel servo-assisted brakes from Clayton Dewandre. The same year, Singer took over Calcott Brothers.

In the 1920s, Singer sales climbed steadily, By 1928, Singer was Britain&#x27;s third largest car maker after Austin and Morris. Singer, restricted by a built-in site, acquired other companies for factory space. In 1926, they made 9,000 cars. In 1929, with seven factories and 8,000 employees, they produced 28,000 cars, though having just 15% they trailed far behind Austin and Morris which shared 60% of the market. Hampered by their new acquisitions, the cost of new machinery and a moving assembly line in their latest acquisition, Singer&#x27;s offerings were eclipsed by new models from Austin, Morris, and Hillman; from 1932, these were joined by the new Ford Model Y.

The Senior would be redesigned in 1928, with capacity increased to and an additional crankshaft main bearing added (up from two to three). And, like the Junior and Six, the track was increased. One other model was a fabric-bodied convertible saloon, the Sun.

The redesign left Singer with a few hundred older chassis, which the company bodied and sold as Deliverys, at £180.

Toward the end of the year, a privateer ran a two-seat Junior up Porlock Hill one hundred times in fifteen hours, which moved Singer to rename that model the Porlock.

In 1929, a 2+2 on the Junior chassis appeared, and the Senior disappeared, while the Six gained a sidevalve. This was joined by a Super Six, with a OHV and four-speed manual transmission. This was, said &quot;The Autocar&quot;, &quot;the most impressive Singer yet&quot;

The Junior of 1931, with styling resembling the top-priced saloon and a &quot;waterfall&quot; grille, which lent the car its common name. The range continued in a very complex manner using developments of the ohc Junior engine, with an , the Ten, the sidevalve 12/6, the sidevalve 18/6 (now ), and the OHV Silent-Six (now ). At the top of the price range was the £480 Charles Frederick ‘C F’ Beauvais-designed Kaye Don saloon, built on the Silent-Six platform. Hydraulic brakes were standard, except for the Kaye Don, which relied on servo-boosted Dewandre brakes. A sliding sunshine roof was also available.

In 1932, Leo J. Shorter became chief engineer (by 1940, technical director). He and two other designers created the new Sports Nine Sports, which made its debut at the London Motor Show that same year; it featured a two-bearing crankshaft engine of 972cc, which gave the car its name. Owing to manufacturing difficulties of the new bodywork, the &quot;9&quot; engine was fitted to a number of Junior chassis&#x27; as a stopgap until the production cars were ready, which gave rise to the incredibly rare &quot;Junior-Nine&quot;. The production numbers are unknown, and only 8 are known to have survived. And in 1933, The Nine was joined by a new six-cylinder, a 1.5 Horsepower six-cylinder, and a 2-Liter six-cylinder, while the Junior was dropped and the new sidevalve-engined 12 displaced the Ten. The Sports Nine was &quot;an immediate success&quot; among trials racers, and Singer entered a specially-prepared version at Le Mans, which led to the Nine being commonly called the Le Mans. Singer earned an &quot;excellent reputation&quot; in racing before three works Nines appeared at the 1935 Ulster Tourist Trophy, where all three wrecked, all from the same cause (steering failure) and all, incredibly, at the same spot. All the drivers literally walked away unscathed, but Singer&#x27;s reputation in racing was beyond repair.

In summer 1934, the Eleven was launched and was very innovative in its class by including the clutch-less &quot;Fluidrive&quot; Fluid coupling and Independent front suspension, and was also offered with &quot;aerodynamic&quot; Airstream coachwork; the name was given independent of the Chrysler.

Independent front suspension was added to the Nine in 1935, while the larger models got Fluidrive transmissions. The new two litre Sixteen debuted that year as well, also with IFS. The Nine became the Bantam in 1935, which also debuted at the London Motor Show; it was a close copy of the Ford Model Y (a popular subject for copying), with two-bearing crankshafts and a engine; this, and its high £127 pricetag, made it uncompetitive. It had a two-bearing crankshaft and was the first Singer with a synchromesh gearbox, albeit with only three forward gears. Continuing decline in sales led to financial trouble, and Singer attempted to cut costs, such as by switching back to mechanical brakes on the Nine in 1939.

In May 1936, W. E. Bullock, who had been managing director from 1919 together with his son, general manager from 1931, resigned following criticism from the shareholders at their annual general meeting. No longer viable, Singer &amp; Co Limited was dissolved in December 1936 and what had been its business was transferred to a new company, Singer Motors Limited.

In 1938, the three-bearing OHC engine of was introduced, the three speed gearbox only had synchro between 2nd and top.

====Singer Motors Limited====

From 1938 to 1955, Singer Motors Ltd supplied new OHC engines (a few 9HP, a 10HP and numerous 12 HPs plus 4-speed gearboxes) for fitment to HRG Engineering Company&#x27;s sports cars at Tolworth, Surrey - these replaced the 1.5 litre Meadows engines fitted to earlier cars.

After the Second World War, the new Roadster and the Ten and Twelve saloons all returned to production with little change. In 1948, Singer&#x27;s first streamlined car appeared, the SM1500 (designed by Technical Director Shorter), which featured coil spring IFS. and a separate chassis, still using the SOHC 1500cc engin; It was, however, expensive, at £799, and hopes it would save the company proved in vain.

The SM1500 was given a traditional radiator grille and renamed the Hunter in 1954; the high-priced Hunter was equally in vain. (Though specified with an optional HRG-designed DOHC engine, this was likely never sold.) In the December 2011 edition of &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;, a 1954 SM1500 was compared to an MG TD, finding the Singer the superior roadster.

==Rootes Group==
By 1955, the business was in financial difficulties and the Rootes Brothers bought it the following year. They had first handled Singer sales just before the First World War. The Singer brand was absorbed into their Rootes Group which had been an enthusiastic exponent of badge engineering since the early 1930s. The next Singer car, the Gazelle, was a more up-market Hillman Minx. which retained the pre-war designed Singer OHV engine for the I and II versions until 1958, when the IIA was given the Minx pushrod engine. The Vogue, which ran alongside the Minx/Gazelle from 1961, was based on the Hillman Super Minx with differing front end styling and more luxurious trim.

After 1958, all Singer products were mere badge-engineered models.

By 1970, Rootes were themselves struggling financially. They had been acquired by the American Chrysler corporation, and founder (by then Sir) William Rootes had died in 1964. In April 1970, as part of a rationalisation process, the last Singer rolled off the assembly line, almost 100 years after George Singer built the first cycle. The last car to carry the Singer name was an upmarket version of the rear engined Hillman Imp called the Chamois. With the take over of Rootes by Chrysler begun in 1964 and completed in 1967, many of the brands were set to vanish and use of the Singer name ended in 1970. The site of the Singer factory in Coventry is now occupied by Singer Hall, a hall of residence for Coventry University.

<doc id="1172173" wikidata="Q698949" url="?curid=1172173" title="Sink the Bismarck!">
<text>Sink the Bismarck! is a 1960 black-and-white CinemaScope British war film based on the 1959 book &quot;The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck&quot; by C. S. Forester. It stars Kenneth More and Dana Wynter and was directed by Lewis Gilbert. To date, it is the only film made that deals directly with the operations, chase and sinking of the battleship by the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Although war films were common in the 1960s, &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was seen as something of an anomaly, with much of its time devoted to the &quot;unsung back-room planners as much as on the combatants themselves&quot;. Its historical accuracy, in particular, met with much praise despite a number of inconsistencies.

&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was the inspiration for Johnny Horton&#x27;s highly popular 1960 song, &quot;Sink the Bismarck&quot;,
credited by &quot;Variety&quot; with boosting the film&#x27;s American gross alone by an estimated half a million dollars.

The film had its Royal World Premiere in the presence of the Duke of Edinburgh at the Odeon Leicester Square on 11 February 1960.
==Plot==

In February 1939, Nazi Germany&#x27;s most powerful battleship, , is launched, beginning a new era of German sea power. In May 1941, British naval intelligence discovers &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser are about to sail into the North Atlantic to attack Allied convoys. From an underground war room in London, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More) coordinates the hunt for the dreaded &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The two German warships encounter and in the Denmark Strait, and the four warships engage in a deadly gun battle.

The battle results in the annihilation and violent disintegration of the &quot;Hood&quot;, shocking combatants on both sides. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; is alone and is fired on by the two German ships. She manages to inflict damage on &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s&quot; bow, but &quot;Bismarck&quot; returns fire, destroying the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;&#x27; bridge. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; emits a smoke screen behind which to retreat. &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; also retreat, but they are shadowed by the cruisers HMS &quot;Suffolk&quot; and HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; using radar. On hearing of the loss of the &quot;Hood&quot;, Winston Churchill issues the order to &quot;sink the &quot;Bismarck&quot;&quot;. Later, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; breaks away and heads towards the port of Brest, in occupied France, while &quot;Bismarck&quot; turns and fires at the British cruisers to provide cover as she escapes. The attack forces the cruisers to retreat. An air assault from the carrier damages &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s&quot; fuel tanks, but the vessel is otherwise largely undamaged.

Back at London&#x27;s operations headquarters, Captain Shepard gambles that Admiral Gunther Lütjens, the Fleet Commander aboard &quot;Bismarck&quot;, has ordered a return to friendly waters where U-boats and air cover will make it impossible to attack. He plans to intercept and attack the German vessel before she reaches safety. Shepard commits a disproportionately large force to the search, and his wager pays off when &quot;Bismarck&quot; is located steaming toward the French coast. British forces have a narrow time window in which to destroy or slow their prey before German support and their own diminishing fuel supplies will preclude further attacks. Swordfish torpedo planes from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; have two chances. The first fails when the pilots misidentify as &quot;Bismarck&quot;, but thankfully their new magnetic torpedo detonators are faulty, with most exploding as soon as they hit the sea. Returning to the carrier and changing to conventional contact exploders, their second attack, this time on the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, is successful. One torpedo causes only minor damage; but a catastrophic second hit near the stern jams the German battleship&#x27;s rudder.

Unable to repair the rudder, &quot;Bismarck&quot; steams in circles. During the night two British destroyers attack the crippled battleship with torpedoes. One hits, but &quot;Bismarck&quot; returns fire, sinking the destroyer HMS &quot;Solent&quot;. The main force of British ships, including battleships and , find &quot;Bismarck&quot; the next day and rain shells upon her. Lütjens insists that German forces will arrive to save them, but he is killed when a shell strikes &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s bridge. The remaining bridge officers are killed and the crew abandon their sinking ship. On board &quot;King George V,&quot; Admiral John Tovey orders the newly joined cruiser to finish &quot;Bismarck&quot; off. The cruiser fires torpedoes at the German battleship, causing the vessel to sink faster than her crew can escape. The captain of &quot;King George V&quot;, Wilfrid Patterson, lowers his head as &quot;Bismarck&quot; disappears beneath the waves. Admiral Tovey orders &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; to pick up survivors, finally saying tersely: &quot;Well, gentlemen, let&#x27;s go home.&quot;

==Development==
===Scripting===
C. S. Forester reportedly wrote the story as a screen treatment for 20th Century-Fox before even writing the book.

Writer Edmund H. North worked closely with Forester&#x27;s story, compressing events and time lines to make the plot taut. Along with the director, he decided to use a documentary-style technique, switching back-and-forth from a fairly insular war room to action taking place on remote battleships. The action is made more realistic when the human element of men in a game of wits and nerves is involved. The use of Edward R. Murrow reprising his wartime broadcasts from London also lends an air of authenticity and near-documentary feel. Lewis Gilbert said it was a &quot;very well written script&quot; one of the few in his career that he barely altered. &quot;It was more like a detective story,&quot; said Gilbert.

Gilbert was offered the film by John Brabourne. They decided to shoot the film in black and white in order to intercut it with newsreel footage and to make it seem more authentic.

The film credits identify the actual Director of Operations as Capt. R. A. B. Edwards and &quot;Capt. Shepard&quot; as fictional. The Shepard-Davis interplay added human interest to the storyline. In a similar manner, the battle between British and German forces is also recreated as a human drama, with Admiral Lütjens pitted against Captain Shepard in a &quot;psychological chess match&quot;.

===Casting===
Lewis Gilbert suggested Kenneth More for the lead, with whom he had worked several times before. Dana Wynter was under contract to 20th Century-Fox.

==Production==
===Ships involved===
&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was made in 1960, as the last major Second World War fleet units were being retired. Producer John Brabourne was able to use his influence as son-in-law of Lord Mountbatten, then Chief of the Defence Staff, to obtain the full co-operation of the Admiralty. The soon-to-be-scrapped battleship provided some footage of a capital ship&#x27;s 15-inch gun turrets in action, and was used for scenes set on board HMS &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, &quot;King George V&quot;, and &quot;Bismarck&quot; herself. The cruiser , now preserved in London, was used to depict the cruisers involved in &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s pursuit, including , &quot;Suffolk&quot;, &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;. A in reserve was used as the set for &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s destruction, and one of her tall raked funnels is glimpsed in the final scenes.

The aircraft carrier is briefly shown as herself, despite the postwar addition of a large angled flight deck and a massive Type 984 &quot;searchlight&quot; radar; the same ship is also used to depict HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; sailing from Gibraltar. All flying from both carriers was filmed aboard – clearly marked with her postwar pennant number R06 – and three surviving Fairey Swordfish aircraft were restored, of which two were flown from her flight deck. These three aircraft now form the core of the Royal Navy Historic Flight. A 2010 article in &quot;Aeroplane&quot; identifies the Swordfish flown in the production: &quot;LS326&quot;, carrying its true serial, was marked as &quot;5A&quot; of 825 Naval Air Squadron, while &quot;NF389&quot; was marked as &quot;LS423&quot; / &quot;5B&quot;. The same actor plays the leader of the Swordfish attack from HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; (in reality, Lt Cdr Eugene Esmonde VC, DSO), and also the pilot from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; who later fired the torpedo which crippled &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s steering gear (in reality Lt John Moffat RNR).

The destroyers used to depict the torpedo night attacks were the , representing the flagship of &quot;Captain (D), of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla&quot; (in reality, Captain Vian in ) and the , representing the fictitious which &quot;Bismarck&quot; destroys in the film. Their pennant numbers can be made out quite clearly, although they are reversed because of the film&#x27;s convention that British ships should move from left to right on the screen and German ships &quot;vice versa&quot;. These were the last classes of destroyer built during the war, and the last to have the classic War Emergency Programme destroyers&#x27; outline. HMS &quot;Cavalier&quot; remained in service until 1972, the last RN destroyer to have served in the Second World War, and is now preserved at Chatham Dockyard to commemorate all these vessels, but the newer and larger HMS &quot;Hogue&quot; was broken up shortly after the film was completed, following a collision off Ceylon with the Indian cruiser (formerly ).

The large models of the major warships &quot;Bismarck&quot;, HMS &quot;Hood&quot;, HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, HMS &quot;King George V&quot;, HMS &quot;Rodney&quot; and the s, are generally accurate, although HMS &quot;Hood&quot; is depicted in a slightly earlier configuration than that which actually blew up. The use of models in a studio tank was intercut with wartime footage and staged sequences using available full-size warships. &quot;Bismarck&quot; anti-aircraft guns, however, are represented by stock footage of British QF 2-pounder naval guns.

==Reception==
===Critical===
For the most part, the historical accuracy in &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was praised by critics, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling it a &quot;first-rate film re-creation of a thrilling historical event&quot;. A contemporary &quot;The New York Times&quot; review by A. H. Weiler, likewise championed its realism in saying &quot;a viewer could not ask for greater authenticity&quot;. However, it went on to criticise both the acting and the constant scene changes &quot;from Admiralty plotting rooms to the bridges of the ships at sea&quot;, claiming that this lessened the &quot;over-all effectiveness&quot; of both scenes. &quot;Film4&quot; praised its cinematography, noting that it &quot;very realistically re-enacted scenes in the War Room of the Admiralty&quot; as well as &quot;excellently filmed episodes using miniature models&quot;.

During the postwar period, war films were one staple of the British film industry, with &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; an exemplar, sharing the &quot;common themes, actors ... visual style and ideological messages&quot; of the genre. British magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot; viewed &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; positively, stating that &quot;this fine film fully captures the tensions, dangers and complexities of battle by concentrating on the unsung back-room planners as much as on the combatants themselves&quot; while also praising More&#x27;s performance. Attention was drawn to the ways in which it deviated from other war films of the period, specifically commenting on how &quot;there is a respect for the enemy that is missing in many previous flag-wavers&quot;. The film was given a four-star rating.

Gilbert&#x27;s continual forays into events that shaped the British war experience mirrored his own background as a wartime filmmaker. His films merged historical episodes and the role of the individual, with &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; characterised as having an &quot;emotional punch, not least because Gilbert&#x27;s direction relentlessly focuses on the human dimension amidst the history&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was well received by the public and, according to &quot;Kine Weekly&quot;, it was the second most popular film released in Great Britain in 1960 (after &quot;Doctor in Love&quot;). The film replicated the success of other British war-themed productions in the decade that also received healthy box office, including &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955) and &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956). Unlike most British war films &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was a surprise hit in North America. Gilbert was surprised by the film&#x27;s popularity in the USA as &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; had flopped in that country, and that had a strong personal story which &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; did not. And the battle did not involve the USA at all. (This led to Gilbert turning down the offer of a significant percentage of the profits in &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; which he later regretted. In 1996 he said he was still receiving some money from it.) 
The film was More&#x27;s most successful picture in the US.

The Johnny Horton song &quot;Sink the Bismarck&quot;, which reached No. 3 on both the US pop and country charts, was not an original movie tie-in and did not appear in the film, but was instrumental in introducing the film to an American audience. In addition to its airplay and chart success, Horton&#x27;s song was used in the American promotional trailer. &quot;Variety&quot; estimated half a million of the gross could be attributed to the success of the song.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; was made before 1975, when the British code-breaking at Bletchley Park was declassified, so it did not reveal that Shepard&#x27;s hunches about the movements of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; were supported by intelligence. Direction finding and traffic analysis showed that on 25 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; stopped talking to Wilhelmshaven and resumed with Paris, and Shepard committed to the belief that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was headed for the French coast. The radio switch from Wilhelmshaven to Paris might have been caused by &quot;Bismarck&quot; crossing the line between southern Greenland and the northern Hebrides, which placed her under Group West instead of Group North. Nonetheless, Shepard&#x27;s hunch was proved correct when, by good luck, a Luftwaffe Enigma transmission was intercepted and decoded at Bletchley Park, revealing that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was headed for Brest to repair an oil leak. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s Enigma code had been broken early in the war, unlike the German naval Enigma code, which was only broken later and was subject only to traffic analysis during the &quot;Bismarck&quot; pursuit. Damage during her battle with HMS &quot;Hood&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; caused flooding that put &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s bow barely above sea level. Oil slicks caused by hits from HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; were apparent. In the film, &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s bow remains at its normal height above sea level.
Some minor errors involve the visual appearance of &quot;Bismarck&quot;. When a spy in Kristiansand, Norway, sees &quot;Bismarck&quot; arrive in Norwegian waters (sailing from the east), the ship is shown sailing from right to left (from the west). &quot;Bismarck&quot; has no apparent camouflage but in fact, the ship still had striped &quot;Baltic camouflage&quot; along her sides, which was removed shortly before she headed out to sea. Also, the photo-reconnaissance Spitfire that photographs &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; in a fjord is shown as two different versions, each with different canopies.

&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; simplifies the movements of HMS &quot;Hood&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in the battle. The film shows an early order to turn to allow the British ships to fire full broadsides. In reality, they sought to close the distance first, presenting smaller targets to the German ships but using only their forward gun turrets which reduced their firepower advantage by eight big guns, while &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; were firing full broadsides of all their main guns. The film does not show that HMS &quot;Hood&quot; mistook heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; for &quot;Bismarck&quot;, at first firing at the wrong ship before correcting her fire. Only in her final moments did HMS &quot;Hood&quot; begin a turn to fire a broadside on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. HMS &quot;Hood&quot; was hit during this turn and she exploded. The turn presented &quot;Hood&quot;″s deck armour at an angle more vulnerable to shell penetration and has been cited as a possible cause for the explosion and her subsequent destruction, an issue the film does not cover. HMS &quot;Hood&quot; is shown firing to port while the &quot;Bismarck&quot; is shown firing to starboard; in fact it was the other way around.

In one scene, Lütjens speculates that after &quot;Bismarck&quot; has undergone repair in Brest, the two German battleships based there, and , could join &quot;Bismarck&quot; in raiding Allied shipping. There is no record of such a discussion at that time, although it would have been possible for &quot;Bismarck&quot; to sortie with the two battleships if &quot;Bismarck&quot; had reached the port.

Another historical deviation was made in depicting the night engagement between British destroyers and &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The film portrayal shows three British hits by torpedoes, while the British destroyer HMS &quot;Solent&quot; is hit and destroyed by &quot;Bismarck&quot;. There was no destroyer named &quot;Solent&quot; and no successful torpedo attack, although S-class submarine did exist during the war as a submarine operating in the Eastern Fleet in 1944. On 26 May, a Royal Navy destroyer squadron, led by Captain (later Admiral) Philip Vian in , did exchange gunfire during unsuccessful torpedo attacks, with &quot;Bismarck&quot; inflicting minor damage to the destroyers. The heroic action of the attached Polish destroyer (ex N-class HMS &quot;Nerissa&quot;) was not depicted, although she sailed straight for &quot;Bismarck&quot;, signalling &quot;I am a Pole&quot; as she went, but none of her shots found their mark.

The aircraft that finally located &quot;Bismarck&quot; after she escaped detection by HMS &quot;Suffolk&quot; and HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; is correctly shown as a Catalina, but the fact that it was piloted by an American Naval Reserve officer, Ensign Leonard Smith, could not be revealed until long after the war, since the United States was neutral at the time of the engagement. The attacks by Fleet Air Arm Swordfish show some aircraft being shot down; no Swordfish was lost to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s guns and all were recovered. However, from HMS &quot;Victorious&quot;″s air raid, two Fairey Fulmar escort fighters ran out of fuel and ditched. Three fliers were picked up from a rubber boat.

&quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; also does not show controversial events after &quot;Bismarck&quot; sank, including &#x27;s quick departure after rescuing only 110 survivors, because the British suspected that a German U-boat was in the area and withdrew.

Perhaps the most significant historical error is that the film places the British naval intelligence operation in the Admiralty, Whitehall, London. The actual centre of intelligence operations during the Battle of the Atlantic and the pursuit of &quot;Bismarck&quot; was at Derby House, Liverpool.

===Portrayal of Günther Lütjens===
The film has been criticised for its portrayal of German Admiral Günther Lütjens, who is portrayed as a stereotypical committed Nazi, crazed in his undaunted belief that &quot;Bismarck&quot; is unsinkable. In reality, Lütjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of antisemitic crimes during Kristallnacht. He is portrayed as saying &quot;Never forget that you are Nazis&quot;, but the term &quot;Nazi&quot; was a short form pejorative term used by Germans to refer to the full name &quot;Nationalsozialisten&quot; (&quot;National Socialists&quot;) that has become the common name used in English to refer to the ideology and its followers. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler visited &quot;Bismarck&quot; before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute. He was pessimistic of the chances of success of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s mission and realised that it would be a daunting task.

The film shows Lütjens ordering Captain Ernst Lindemann to open fire on HMS &quot;Hood&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. In reality, Lütjens ordered Lindemann to avoid engaging HMS &quot;Hood&quot;; Lindemann refused and ordered the ship&#x27;s guns to open fire.

==Other productions==
A revival of interest in the &quot;Bismarck&quot; was reflected in numerous publications that followed the film, as well as a variety of scale models that were produced. When the 1989 expedition by Dr. Robert Ballard to locate and photograph the remains of the battleship proved to be successful, further attention was directed to the story of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. A number of documentaries have also been produced including the Channel 4 miniseries &quot;Battle of Hood and Bismarck&quot; (2002) and &quot;Hunt for the Bismarck&quot; aired in 2007 on the History Channel network worldwide.

<doc id="1172181" wikidata="Q381255" url="?curid=1172181" title="American nationalism">
<text>American nationalism is a form of civic, ethnic, cultural or economic influences found in the United States. Essentially, it indicates the aspects that characterize and distinguish the United States as an autonomous political community. The term often explains efforts to reinforce its national identity and self-determination within its national and international affairs.

All four forms of nationalism have found expression throughout the United States&#x27; history, depending on the historical period. The first Naturalization Act of 1790 passed by Congress and President George Washington defined American identity and citizenship on racial lines, declaring that only &quot;free white men of good character&quot; could become citizens, and denying citizenship to enslaved black people and anyone of non-European stock; thus it was a form of ethnic nationalism. Some American scholars have argued that the United States government institutionalized a civic nationalism founded upon legal and rational concepts of citizenship, being based on common language and cultural traditions, and that the Founding Fathers of the United States established the country upon liberal and individualist principles.

== History ==
===Colonial===
The United States traces its origins to the Thirteen Colonies founded by Britain in the 17th and early 18th century. Residents identified with Britain until the mid-18th century when the first sense of being &quot;American&quot; emerged. The Albany Plan proposed a union between the colonies in 1754. Although unsuccessful, it served as a reference for future discussions of independence.

===American Revolution===
Soon afterward, the colonies faced several common grievances over acts passed by the British Parliament, including taxation without representation. Americans were in general agreement that only their own colonial legislatures—and not Parliament in London—could pass internal taxes. Parliament vigorously insisted otherwise and no compromise was found. The London government punished Boston for the Boston Tea Party, and the Thirteen Colonies united and formed the Continental Congress, which lasted from 1774 to 1789. Fighting broke out in 1775 and the sentiment swung to independence in early 1776, influenced significantly by the appeal to American nationalism by Thomas Paine. His pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; was a runaway best seller in 1776, read aloud in taverns and coffee houses. Congress unanimously issued a Declaration of Independence announcing a new nation of independent states had formed, the United States of America. American Patriots won the American Revolutionary War and received generous peace terms from Britain in 1783. The minority of Loyalists (loyal to King George III) could remain or leave, but about 80% remained and became full American citizens. Frequent parades along with new rituals and ceremonies—and a new flag—provided popular occasions for expressing a spirit of American nationalism.

The new nation operated under the very weak national government set up by the Articles of Confederation, and most Americans prioritized their state over the nation. Nationalists led by George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison had Congress call a constitutional convention in 1787. It produced the Constitution for a strong national government which was debated in every state and unanimously adopted. It went into effect in 1789 as the first modern constitutional liberal democracy based on the consent of the governed, with Washington as the first President.

===Westward Expansion===
In an 1858 speech, future President Abraham Lincoln alluded to a form of American civic nationalism originating from the tenets of the Declaration of Independence as a force for national unity in the United States, stating that it was a method for uniting diverse peoples of different ethnic ancestries into a common nationality:
=== American Civil War ===
White Southerners increasingly felt alienated—they saw themselves as becoming second-class citizens as aggressive anti-slavery Northerners tried to end their ability to enslave people to the fast-growing western territories. They questioned whether their loyalty to the nation trumped their commitment to their state and their way of life since it was so intimately bound up with slavery and whether they could enslave people. A sense of Southern nationalism was starting to emerge; however, it was rudimentary as late as 1860 when the election of Lincoln was a signal for most of the slave states in the South to secede and form a new nation. The Confederate government insisted the nationalism was real and imposed increasing burdens on the population in the name of independence and nationalism. The fierce combat record of the Confederates demonstrates their commitment to the death for independence. The government and army refused to compromise and were militarily overwhelmed in 1865. By the 1890s, the white South felt vindicated through its belief in the newly constructed memory of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The North came to accept or at least tolerate racial segregation and disfranchisement of black voters in the South. The spirit of American nationalism had returned to Dixie.

===Reconstruction, Gilded Age and Progressive Era===
The North&#x27;s triumph in the American Civil War marked a significant transition in American national identity. The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment settled the fundamental question of national identity, such as the criteria for becoming a citizen of the United States. Everyone born in the territorial boundaries of the United States or those areas and subject to its jurisdiction was an American citizen, regardless of ethnicity or social status (indigenous people on reservations became citizens in 1924, while indigenous people off reservations had always been citizens).

In the early 20th century, one of the highest-profile advocates for American nationalism was Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt&#x27;s policies both at home and abroad, which came to be known as the New Nationalism, included an element of a strong national identity. He insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a &quot;hyphenated American&quot; who juggled multiple loyalties.

With a fast-growing industrial economy, immigrants were welcome from Europe, Canada, Mexico, and Cuba, and millions came. Becoming a full citizen was easy, requiring the completion of paperwork over five years.  However, new Asian arrivals were not welcome. The U.S. imposed restrictions on most Chinese immigrants in the 1880s and informal restrictions on most Japanese in 1907. By 1924, it was difficult for any Asian to enter the United States, but children born in the United States to Asian parents were full citizens. The restrictions were ended on the Chinese in the 1940s and on other Asians in 1965.
===World Wars and interwar period===
After the United States entered World War I, nationalism surged. Americans enlisted in the military en masse, motivated by propaganda and war films. There was very little resistance to conscription.

By the First World War, many native-born Protestants were skeptical of recent immigrants to the United States, who were often Catholic or Jewish and spoke languages other than English in their daily lives. There was a strong belief among many in favor of &quot;one hundred percent Americanism&quot;, in contrast to &quot;hyphenated Americanism&quot;. This was exemplified by the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in 1915 and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1910s and 20s.  In the early- to-mid 20th century, public school education became compulsory in many jurisdictions, with parochial schools being restricted or outlawed. The school day typically began with the Pledge of Allegiance. It was in this milieu that the Immigration Act of 1924 was passed to regulate immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. However, during this period, citizenship was also extended to Native Americans, both on- and off-reservation, for the first time.

World War II led to unprecedented nationalism in the United States. After the 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, many Americans enlisted in the military. During the war, much of American life centered on contributing to the war effort, mainly through volunteer efforts, entry into the labor force, rationing, price controls, and income saving. Citizens willingly accepted these sacrifices out of a sense of nationalism, feeling they were for the greater good. Even members of anti-war groups like the pacifist churches, anti-war movement, and conscientious objectors abandoned their pacifism for the sake of the war, feeling that World War II was a just war.

===Cold War===
Following World War II and beginning with the Cold War, the United States emerged as a world superpower and abandoned its traditional policy of isolationism in favor of interventionism. With this, nationalism took on a new form in the U.S., as Americans began to view their country as a world police with the ultimate goal of eradicating communism from the world. This nationalist fervor was fueled by US involvement in the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and many other conflicts.

===Modern era===
The September 11 attacks of 2001 led to a wave of nationalist expression in the United States. The start of the war on terror was accompanied by a rise in military enlistment that included not only lower-income Americans but also middle-class and upper-class citizens. This nationalism continued long into the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War.

==Contemporary United States==
Nationalism and Americanism remain topics in the modern United States. Political scientist Paul McCartney, for instance, argues that as a nation defined by a creed and sense of mission, Americans tend to equate their interests with those of humanity, which informs their global posture. In some instances, it may be considered a form of ethnocentrism and American exceptionalism.

Due to the distinctive circumstances involved throughout history in American politics, its nationalism has developed concerning loyalty to a set of liberal, universal political ideals and perceived accountability to propagate those principles globally. Acknowledging the conception of the United States as accountable for spreading liberal change and promoting democracy throughout the world&#x27;s politics and governance has defined practically all of American foreign policy. Therefore, democracy promotion is not just another measure of foreign policy, but it is instead the fundamental characteristic of their national identity and political determination.

==Varieties of American nationalism==
In a 2016 paper in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, &quot;Varieties of American Popular Nationalism&quot;, sociologists Bart Bonikowski and Paul DiMaggio report on research findings supporting the existence of at least four kinds of American nationalists, including, groups which range from the smallest to the largest: (1) the disengaged, (2) creedal or civic nationalists, (3) ardent nationalists, and (4) restrictive nationalists.

Bonikowski and Dimaggio&#x27;s analysis of these four groups found that &quot;ardent nationalists&quot; made up about 24% of their study, and they comprised the largest of the two groups Bonikowski and Dimaggio consider &quot;extreme&quot;. Members of this group closely identified with the United States, were very proud of their country and strongly associated themselves with factors of national hubris. They felt that a &quot;true American&quot; must speak English and live in the U.S. for most of their life. Fewer, but 75%, believe that a &quot;true American&quot; must be a Christian, and 86% believe a &quot;true American&quot; must be born in the country. Further, ardent nationalists thought that Jews, Muslims, agnostics and naturalized citizens were something less than genuinely American. The second class, Bonikowski and DiMaggio considered &quot;extreme&quot;, was the smallest of the four classes because its members comprised 17% of their respondents. &quot;The disengaged&quot; showed low pride in the government institutions, and they did not fully identify with the United States. Their lack of pride extended to American democracy, American history, political equality in the U.S., and the country&#x27;s political influence. This group was the least nationalistic of all of the four groups which they identified.
The two remaining classes were less homogeneous in their responses than the ardent nationalists and disengaged were. &quot;Restrictive nationalists&quot; had low levels of pride in America and its institutions, but they defined a &quot;true American&quot; in ways that were markedly &quot;exclusionary&quot;. This group was the largest of the four because its members comprised 38% of the study&#x27;s respondents. While their levels of national identification and pride were moderate, they espoused beliefs that caused them to hold restrictive definitions of &quot;true Americans&quot;; for instance, their definitions excluded non-Christians.&quot;

The final group to be identified was &quot;creedal nationalists&quot; (also known as civic nationalists), whose members made up 22% of the study&#x27;s respondents who were studied. This group believed in liberal values, was proud of the United States, and its members held the fewest restrictions on who could be considered a true American. They closely identified with their country, which they felt &quot;very close&quot; to, and were proud of its achievements. Bonikowski and Dimaggio dubbed the group &quot;creedal&quot; because their beliefs most closely approximated the precepts of what is widely considered the American creed.

As part of their findings, the authors report that the connection between big money, religious belief, and national identity is significant. The belief that being a Christian is an integral part of what it means to be a &quot;true American&quot; is the most significant factor which separates the creedal nationalists and the disengaged from the restrictive and ardent nationalists. They also determined that their groupings cut across partisan boundaries, and they also help to explain what they perceive is the recent success of populist, nativist, and racist rhetoric in American politics.

According to a 2021 &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; study by Bart Bonikowski, Yuval Feinstein, and Sean Bock, competing understandings of American nationhood had emerged in the United States in the prior two decades. They find, &quot;nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood.&quot;

===Cultural nationalism===

Cultural nationalism has historically been an integral element of American nationalism. Such cultural nationalists form group allegiances based on a common cultural heritage rather than race or political party. This heritage may include culture (Culture of the United States), language (English language), religion (Christianity), history (History of the United States), ideology (Democracy), and symbols (National symbols of the United States). Cultural nationalism is distinct from ethnic nationalism, in which race and ethnicity are emphasized over culture and language.

Nationalism gained a cultural character beginning in the late 18th century. Multiple historical ideas have shaped modern cultural nationalism in the U.S., including the concept of the nation state, the fusion of nationalism and religion into religious nationalism, and identity politics.

===Civic nationalism===

American nationalism sometimes takes the form of Civic nationalism, a liberal form of nationalism based on values such as freedom, equality, and individual rights. Civic nationalists view nationhood as a political identity. They argue that liberal democratic principles and loyalty define a civic nation. Membership is open to every citizen, regardless of culture, ethnicity, or language, as long as they believe in these values.

===Trumpism===
President Donald Trump was described as a nationalist, and he embraced the term himself. Several officials within his administration were described as representing a &quot;nationalist wing&quot; within the federal government, including former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller, Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro, former Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka, Special Assistant to the President Julia Hahn, former Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communications Michael Anton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

In a February 2017 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, journalist Uri Friedman described &quot;populist economic nationalist&quot; as a new nationalist movement &quot;modeled on the &#x27;populism&#x27; of the 19th-century U.S. President Andrew Jackson&quot; which was introduced in Trump&#x27;s remarks to the Republican National Convention in a speech written by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Miller had adopted Senator Jeff Sessions&#x27; form of &quot;nation-state populism&quot; while working as his aide. By September 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; journalist Greg Sargent observed that &quot;Trump&#x27;s nationalism&quot; as &quot;defined&quot; by Bannon, Breitbart, Miller and &quot;the rest of the &#x27;populist economic nationalist&#x27; contingent around Trump&quot; was beginning to have wavering support among Trump voters. Some Republican members of Congress were also described as nationalists during the Trump era, such as Representative Steve King, Representative Matt Gaetz, Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Josh Hawley.
During the Trump era, commonly identified American nationalist political commentators included Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, Lou Dobbs, Alex Jones, Charlie Kirk, 
Laura Ingraham, Candace Owens, Michael Savage, Tucker Carlson, Mike Cernovich, and Nick Fuentes.

<text>The War Department was the United Kingdom government department responsible for the supply of equipment to the armed forces of the United Kingdom and the pursuance of military activity. In 1857, it became the War Office. Within the War Office, the name &#x27;War Department&#x27; remained in use to describe the military transport services of the War Department Fleet and the War Department Railways.

==History==

In 1794, the position of Secretary of State for War was created. The Secretary&#x27;s department was at first unofficially known as the War Department. Colonial affairs were later added and it became the Colony Department. After the outbreak of war with revolutionary France it became Colony and War Department and on the restoration of peace in 1815 the Colonial Department. In February 1855, the offices of the Secretary of State for War, and Secretary at War were merged and the new department and became the War Department once again until 1857 when it became the War Office. In 1964, the department became the Ministry of Defence.

==War Department Railways==
One aspect of the War Department&#x27;s work was the supply of locomotives and rolling stock for use on railways in the United Kingdom, other parts of the British Empire, and in theatres of conflict.

In World War I, the War Department ran the War Department Light Railways which were a system of narrow gauge trench railways used for the supply of ammunition and stores, the transport of troops and the evacuation of the wounded.

In World War II, large numbers of steam locomotives were produced, as well as some diesel locomotives, of varying gauges to suit the area of planned operation. After the end of the war, these locomotives were largely disposed of to various railways around the world, though some were retained for peacetime use on UK military railways. Of those that were sold, examples of three types ended up as part of the British Railways fleet (where they were often referred to as &#x27;Austerity&#x27; locos):
* Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST, BR numbers 68006–68080
* WD Austerity Class 8F 2-8-0, BR numbers 90000–90732
* WD Austerity Class 8F 2-10-0, BR numbers 90750–90774

<doc id="1172186" wikidata="Q1088785" url="?curid=1172186" title="Chrysler Sunbeam">
<text>The Chrysler Sunbeam is a small supermini three-door hatchback manufactured by Chrysler Europe at the former Rootes Group factory in Linwood in Scotland, from 1977 to 1981. The Sunbeam&#x27;s development was funded by a UK Government grant with the aim of keeping the Linwood plant running, and the small car was based on the larger Hillman Avenger, also manufactured there. After the takeover of Chrysler&#x27;s European operations by PSA, the model was renamed Talbot Sunbeam and continued in production until 1981. A Talbot Sunbeam Lotus version was successful in rallying and won the World Rally Championship manufacturers&#x27; title for Talbot in 1981.

== Background ==
In the mid-1970s, the British automotive industry was in crisis, marred by bad management, frequent strikes and decreasing competitiveness compared to the increasingly successful French and Japanese automakers. It took its toll on Chrysler UK, which was the name given to the former Rootes Group after its takeover by the American-based Chrysler Corporation. In particular, the Linwood facility was generating losses due to many reasons, including underutilised capacity.

In 1975, the infamous Ryder Report led to the effective nationalisation of Chrysler UK&#x27;s major competitor, British Leyland. Chrysler management decided that the company should therefore also benefit from state aid, and pressed the government for it by threatening to close the UK operations. The government agreed to a state grant reported at £55,000,000 to fund the development of a small car, to be developed in Chrysler&#x27;s UK facilities and manufactured in Linwood.

== Development ==
The development of the new car started in January 1976, under the codename &quot;Project R424&quot;. The technical side was the responsibility of the engineering team in Ryton, while the styling was the responsibility of Chrysler&#x27;s Whitley design studio in Coventry, led by Roy Axe (who left the UK for Chrysler&#x27;s headquarters in the US before the car was launched). Many constraints, such as a very tight schedule, low budget and the need to use as many British components as possible, led to the decision to use the rear-wheel drive Hillman Avenger as the base for the new vehicle, rather than the more trendy front-wheel drive constructions of Chrysler&#x27;s French subsidiary, Simca. The Sunbeam was, unlike the larger Horizon and Alpine models which were launched by Chrysler in the mid to late 1970s, never sold in France as a Simca. Although it was targeted at the supermini size class, the Sunbeam&#x27;s Avenger underpinnings meant that it was slightly larger than its intended rivals, and overlapped with the Horizon model. For this reason, the Sunbeam was only available as a three-door derivative.

Basing the car on the Avenger&#x27;s platform allowed for the car not only to use as many existing components as possible, but also to put it in production in Linwood quickly and at minimal investment. The Avenger&#x27;s wheelbase was shortened by , and some modifications were made to accommodate the 928 cc Coventry Climax-derived engine, an enlarged version of the 875cc unit used in the rear-engined Hillman Imp, also made in Linwood. Other than that, most components were identical to those of the Avenger. The car took its steering wheel and instrument pod from Chrysler&#x27;s recently launched award-winning Simca 1307/Chrysler Alpine.

On the outside, with the exception of the doors, which were straight from the two-door Avenger, the R424 was given an all-new body, styled very much in line with Chrysler&#x27;s new, angular &quot;international&quot; style, conceived by Axe, which was first presented with the debut of the 1975 Simca 1307/Chrysler Alpine, and was later also represented by the 1977 Simca/Chrysler Horizon (&quot;Project C2&quot;). This ensured that the R424 fitted in well with the new Chrysler lineup and came across as fairly modern. Nevertheless, a constraint in the development process took its toll on the initial look of the car - as the C2&#x27;s (Horizon&#x27;s) headlamps were not available at the planned launch time of the R424, the small car was given the lamps of the pre-facelift Hillman Avenger, which required the characteristic recessed mounting in the front fascia. The GLS version had a vinyl roof as standard.

There was only one body style for the Sunbeam, that of a three-door hatchback. The car was literally a hatchback, with the rear hatch formed out of a single piece of glass as seen previously on the Hillman Imp. This required a high rear sill, which, while increasing structural rigidity made the loading and unloading of luggage rather difficult. Although it was a good looking car with clean modern lines, the tricky luggage compartment and the lack of alternative bodystyles - the reasoning being that the Avenger range already offered saloon and estate variants - ultimately compromised the car&#x27;s appeal in the UK market. The Sunbeam&#x27;s main competitor in the UK, the Vauxhall Chevette was produced in different body styles, two- and four-door saloons and an estate, catering to a broader range of customers.

On the interior side, the &quot;GL&quot; version was the first car to sport printed &quot;melded&quot; fabric from Cambrelle on its seats. These have been considered similar to the Avenger in their comfort.

Until the R424&#x27;s launch, most Chrysler UK products were sold in export markets under the Sunbeam brand of the former Rootes portfolio. Chrysler, however, was striving to cut down on the Rootes brand palette (which at that time existed solely by means of badge engineering) and introduce a pan-European image using the Chrysler brand as the only one for the whole range. The result was naming the car, &quot;Chrysler Sunbeam&quot;, and the Sunbeam brand was discontinued, with the remaining Rootes Group models also rebranded as Chryslers in 1976.

== Launch ==
After a remarkably short development period of 19 months, the Chrysler Sunbeam was launched on July 23, 1977, to a positive reception by the British automotive press. An advertising campaign featured Petula Clark singing &quot;...put a Chrysler Sunbeam in your life.&quot; There were initially three engine sizes; 0.9, 1.3 and 1.6 litres, and three trim levels available - base &quot;LS&quot;, better-equipped &quot;GL&quot; and the most expensive &quot;S&quot;. To reduce in-house competition, the more basic versions of the two-door Avengers were dropped at the same time in the UK market, and the Chrysler Horizon was only available in five-door form. The Sunbeam sold well, but was not a runaway success.

In spite of the ability to keep the UK business afloat, Chrysler was still making losses both in Europe and at home, and, facing the possibility of complete bankruptcy, decided to sell Chrysler Europe to PSA. The French company took control of the former Chrysler Europe effective January 1, 1979, and in the course of the year announced all former Chrysler Europe products would be rebranded to Talbots starting August 1, 1979. The Sunbeam was simply rebadged in the strictest sense of the word, with the Chrysler badge on the bonnet replaced by one that read &quot;Talbot&quot;, but retaining its grille with a prominent Chrysler pentastar until 1981.

== Sunbeam Ti and Sunbeam Lotus ==
In order to boost the Sunbeam&#x27;s image, a &quot;hot hatch&quot; version of the Sunbeam was launched at the 1978 British International Motor Show and Paris Motor Show, called &quot;Sunbeam Ti&quot;. On sale in the UK from June 1979 priced at £3,779, it was based on the former Avenger Tiger (the name hailing back to the Sunbeam Tiger), a sporty version of the Avenger. The 1.6-litre (1,598cc) engine fitted to the Sunbeam with twin Weber carburetors delivered . It featured sporty two-tone paint and body kit, and was very sport-oriented, being stripped of equipment that would have compromised its performance (and image). It proved quite popular with reviewers and enthusiasts, and helped to emphasize the advantages of the Sunbeam&#x27;s rear-wheel drive against more trendy (and spacious) front-wheel drive rivals.
Chrysler had also commissioned the sports car manufacturer and engineering company Lotus to develop a strict rally version of the Sunbeam. The resulting &quot;Sunbeam Lotus&quot; was based on the Sunbeam 1.6 GLS, but fitted with stiffer suspension, a larger anti-roll bar and a larger transmission tunnel. The drivetrain comprised an enlarged, 2,172 cc, version of the Lotus 1973 cc Type 907 engine, a 16V slant four engine (the Sunbeam version being the Type 911, along with a ZF gearbox, both mounted in the car at Ludham Airfield, close to the Lotus facility in Hethel, Norfolk, where the almost-complete cars were shipped from Linwood. Final inspection, in turn, took place in Stoke, Coventry. In road trim, the type 911 engine produced at 5,750rpm and of torque at 4,500rpm. In rallying trim this was increased to .

The Sunbeam Lotus was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in April 1979, but the road-going version of the rally car was not ready for deliveries to the public until after the rebranding, and thus became the &quot;Talbot Sunbeam Lotus&quot;. At first these were produced in a scheme of black with silver side stripes, although later models were additionally available in an alternative scheme of Moonstone Blue with silver stripes. The car saw not only enthusiastic press reviews, but also much success in the World Rally Championship - in 1980, Henri Toivonen won the 29th Lombard RAC Rally in one, and, in 1981, the Sunbeam Lotus brought the entire manufacturer&#x27;s championship to Talbot.

Six Sunbeam Lotuses were acquired by Greater Manchester Police for their Traffic Area Support Services (TASS) unit in 1980 in a bid to combat car crime across Greater Manchester, operating alongside the Ford Capris being used by GMP at the time. The six cars were modified to appear as regular Talbot Sunbeams, being painted in regular Talbot colours and having exterior Lotus badging removed while also being equipped with a Britax magnetic blue light, two-tone siren horns, police warning signage on the tailgate lid and a VHF police radio. Throughout their service during the 1980s, five of the six Sunbeam Lotuses were operated interchangeably across various parts of Greater Manchester, often deployed in high-speed stolen vehicle pursuits and also issued with a total of three registration plates and corresponding tax discs each to operate more discreetly. The Sunbeams, alongside the TASS unit, were eventually replaced by the Tactical Vehicle Crime Unit&#x27;s Ford Escort XR3is and Ford Sierra RS Cosworths in the late 1980s.

== Talbot era ==
After the takeover, PSA decided that keeping Linwood running would remain unprofitable in the long run and that the facility would have to be closed. This would also mean the end of the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines. The Sunbeam also overlapped in size with the Simca-based Chrysler Horizon, while the Avenger upon which it was based overlapped with the Peugeot 305, both of which were launched in 1977 and were newer, front wheel drive designs. The decision was quite reasonable, given the advanced age of the former and the fact that the &quot;C2-short&quot;, in development, was to be launched. Even though the C2-short programme was eventually scrapped, PSA did prepare their own version, the Talbot Samba (based on PSA&#x27;s own front-wheel drive supermini, the Peugeot 104). The Samba was launched in 1981, signalling the time the Sunbeam would take its final bow.

Even though the end was looming, the Sunbeam was afforded a facelift for its final 1981 model year, finally gaining flush headlamps along with an entire new front end, featuring the Talbot logo in lieu of the pentastar, which made it look completely in line with the new Talbot lineup. Until the time production ended, about 200,000 Sunbeams were made.

<doc id="1172192" wikidata="Q1636194" url="?curid=1172192" title="Humber Limited">
<text>Humber Limited was a British manufacturer of bicycles, motorcycles, and cars, incorporated and listed on the stock exchange in 1887. It took the name &quot;Humber &amp; Co Limited&quot; because of the high reputation of the products of one of the constituent businesses that had belonged to Thomas Humber. A financial reconstruction in 1899 transferred its business to Humber Limited.

From an interest in motor vehicles beginning in 1896, the motor division became much more important than the cycle division and the cycle trade marks were sold to Raleigh in 1932. The motorcycles were withdrawn from sale during the depression of the 1930s.

Humber is now a dormant marque for automobiles as well as cycles. Following their involvement in Humber through Hillman in 1928 the Rootes brothers acquired 60 per cent of Humber&#x27;s ordinary capital, sufficient for a controlling interest. The two Rootes brothers joined the Humber board in 1932 and began to make Humber the holding company for vehicle manufacturing members of what became their Rootes Group.

By 1960 annual production was around 200,000 vehicles. Previous insistence on Rootes family control, however, may have led to under-capitalisation of the business. Building a brand new car, the Hillman Imp, proved beyond Humber and Rootes Group resources and their businesses were bought by the Chrysler Corporation in 1967.

==History==

===1887–1918===
;Cycle industry

The cycle industry was consolidating in the late 1880s and partners Thomas Humber and fledgling company promoter T Harrison Lambert sold their Humber cycles business to investors who added a number of other substantial cycle manufacturers and then floated the new combine on the stock exchange. Such was the public&#x27;s recognition of Humber products and their high quality and reliability the whole new organisation was named Humber &amp; Co Limited though Humber&#x27;s was not the largest component. Thomas Humber agreed to manage the whole enterprise with its works in Coventry and Wolverhampton as well as Beeston. He retired in 1892 at the end of his 5-year contract.

Humber expanded into Europe and in 1896 their subsidiary, Humber (France), joined with La Société des Vélocipedes Clément and La Société des Cycles Gladiator obtaining stock exchange listings in order to form &quot;one of the largest Cycle monopolies in Europe&quot; and with the intention of improving the position of Humber (France). The directors expressed the greatest interest in the new industry of motor carriages and cycles for which extensive works were to be erected by the monopoly at Levallois Perret. At the time of the flotation prospective investors were told that agencies were already established in all principal towns in France, and the cities: St Petersburg, Copenhagen, Milan, Athens, Brussels, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Buenos Ayres, Santiago, Constantinople, Algiers, Sfax, Tunis, Alexandria, Saigon, Hong Kong, Port Said and throughout the whole of South America. The chairman of the new monopoly was chairman of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co and another director was the manager of Dunlop (France). Negotiations between the parties were completed by Ernest Terah Hooley.

The ambitious new monopoly was not successful, disputes between the partners dragged through the English courts until the turn of the century. A severe economic recession in 1899 then brought about a financial reconstruction and the incorporation of a new company, Humber Limited, to continue the existing business.
;Motorcycles

Humber experimented with motorcycles from their early days, and in 1899 Bert Yates won the first track race for motorcycles in Coventry on a Humber motorcycle. Later models switched to using Minerva engines, but production ceased in 1906 as there was insufficient space at the factory. Motorcycle manufacture resumed in 1908 when the new Stoke factory opened, and the new range were exhibited in 1908 at the annual Stanley show. Humber produced many new models of motorcycle in the pre-war years, but production of motorcycles ceased during the First World War.

;Motor tricycles
In 1899 Humber produced a motorised tricycle at their Beeston works with a De Dion Bouton engine of 1.75 hp or optionally 2.25 hp. This had electric ignition (early De Dion Bouton engines used hot tube ignition), and was capable of . The price in December 1899 was £84. This tricycle was based on the De Dion-Bouton tricycle and built under licence.

;First series production cars
In 1896 Humber built a prototype and nine production motorcars in their new Coventry premises. In November 1896 a car was exhibited at the Stanley Cycle Show in London. They are claimed to be the first series production cars made in England.

At Humber &amp; Company&#x27;s next general meeting in 1897 the managing director said they had received many letters asking if they would produce a motorised vehicle, and that they had in fact been working on this project for two years, but had delayed production until they found a suitably reliable engine. Having now found an engine they were gearing up for production.

The first Humber car was produced in 1898 and was a three-wheeled tricar of the &#x27;sociable&#x27; type powered by a single cylinder Turrell engine. Their first conventional four-wheeled car appeared in 1901. Cars went into production in Beeston near Nottingham as well as Stoke, Coventry but to separate designs. Just as with bicycles Beeston Humber products retained their high quality image. The Beeston works closed in 1908 on the opening of the new works at Stoke. 

Humber&#x27;s profit went from £16,500 in 1905 to £106,500 the next year and £154,400 in 1907.

On 12 March 1908 the new works was officially opened at Stoke, then just outside the city of Coventry. New buildings covered 13.5 acres and allowed for the employment of 5,000 hands. The new works was designed to be capable of producing 150 cars and 1,500 cycles per week. Another financial reconstruction was made in 1909. In 1911 they took over the Centaur Cycle Company.

By this time a wide range of cars was produced from the 998cc Humberette to several six-cylinder 6-litre models. In 1913 Humber was second only to Wolseley as the largest manufacturer of cars in the United Kingdom. Revived by the war Humber produced motorcycles and bicycles for the War Office as well as cars.

===1919–1939===
There were postwar slumps in the early 1920s and in addition the public were moving from pedal cycles to motorcycles as well as to cars. Rover, Singer, Swift, Triumph and Riley all gave up their manufacture of cycles.

====Humber acquisitions====
In 1925 Humber moved into the production of commercial vehicles with the purchase of Commer.

In the year to 1928 Humber&#x27;s chairman was obliged to report a loss for the second year running. Commer Cars&#x27; turnover was substantially increased but Commer did not return to profit. The bicycle business improved but motorcycles did not. Humber cars, the product being as the chairman put it of a distinctive class, were more influenced by conditions than were mass-produced vehicles. Humber he described as one of the oldest and best known higher grade cars.
;Before Rootes

The chairman, Stanley Brotherhood, told a special meeting of shareholders of the exceedingly good performance of one of the 14-40 cars driven by J W Fitzwilliam and his brother who had just returned from traversing 4,500 miles in central Europe including the worst roads in the Balkans. He then reported the &quot;drastic redesign&quot; of Humber&#x27;s cars which together with improved appearance and performance and revised prices were expected to improve the products&#x27; performance in the marketplace.

Mention of the drastic redesign at that special meeting was followed by another meeting to discuss the amalgamation of Humber and its partly-owned subsidiary Hillman Motor Car Company. Hillman, the chairman explained, made one of the most popular medium priced cars and would provide a suitable partner to the distinctive Humber products. Shareholders were unanimous that the amalgamation should go ahead on the proposed terms.

In 1929 Hillman, under the control of the Rootes brothers, was amalgamated with Humber—the combine was not under the control of the Rootes brothers—but William Rootes&#x27; marketing skills had been immediately brought into play when Rootes Limited had been appointed &quot;World Exporters&quot;. In December 1929 reviewing the 1929 year the chairman told shareholders Humber had now introduced three new models named: 16-50, for the 1928 Motor Show, Snipe and a seven-seater Pullman both for the October 1929 Motor Show. For the time being the 9-28 and 20-65 hp models would continue but at a reduced price.
;After Rootes
Later Michael Sedgwick would describe the events of this era as &quot;a levelling process comparable to the fate of Wolseley&quot; (&#x27;s 1920s cars). Out, he said, went uncertain braking, the i.o.e. engine and superbly finished coachwork, the new cars were pure Rootes with Bendix brakes, downdraught carburettors, &quot;silent third&quot; gearboxes with central gear lever and hydraulic shock absorbers. The 16 hp car could cope with the Humber Snipe bodywork only with a low final drive ratio. The other cars also became slightly bigger Hillmans with different engines and a longer wheelbase. A Humber Twelve was introduced that looked like a Hillman Minx with a painted spare wheel cover and hinged quarter lights. There was attractive work by independent coachbuilders on the Twelve chassis. The Vogue sports saloon may or may not have been designed by couturier Captain Molyneux. The Twelve&#x27;s engine was bored out to 75 mm and powered Hillman&#x27;s Fourteen and even Sunbeam-Talbot&#x27;s postwar 90. By the outbreak of war in 1939 the quite fast big-engined Super Snipe with hydraulic brakes was selling well and one model became the Army&#x27;s famous second world war staff car.
===1939–1945===
The Ryton on Dunsmore plant which closed at the end of 2006 had originated in 1939 as one of the so-called shadow factories: the Ryton plant was originally built to produce aero engines. At Speke, Liverpool, another shadow factory opened in April 1939 assembled bombers. Armoured cars, scout cars and staff cars were made in the existing factories along with much other war material 

General Montgomery, Commander of the British and Allied forces in Northern Africa during the Desert war of World War II, had two specially built Humber Super Snipe four door open tourers made with larger front wings or guards, mine proof floors, special fittings and long range fuel tanks. Two cars were built for him and used in the Africa campaign against General Rommel, who used a Horch open staff car. Montgomery&#x27;s Humbers were known as &#x27;Old Faithful&#x27; and the &#x27;Victory Car&#x27;. Both cars still exist in museums in England and are a testament to the high engineering and manufacturing standards of Humber and Rootes Ltd. The victory car drove Montgomery and Churchill through the streets of London during the VE parades at the end of the war.

===Military vehicles===
====Annual vehicle production====
* 1929-30— 9,000 vehicles
* 1933-34—20,000
* 1937-39—41,000
* 1946-47—42,000
* 1949-50—90,000

===1945–1967===
In the postwar era, Humber&#x27;s mainstay products included the four-cylinder Hawk and six-cylinder Super Snipe. Being a choice of businessmen and officialdom alike, Humbers gained a reputation for well appointed interiors and solid quality. The Hawk and the Super Snipe went through various designs, though all had a &quot;transatlantic&quot; influence.
::Annual output, 200,000 vehicles
In 1960 Rootes was the world&#x27;s twelfth largest motor corporation by volume, its annual output nearly 200,000 cars, vans and trucks. They employed some 20,000 people. The group had six million square feet (557,000m2) of manufacturing space and owned nine assembly plants outside Britain. They were involved in car hire, hire purchase and driving schools and even made air conditioners. There were about one thousand dealers in the UK. The two Rootes brothers remained in control of their group from their adjoining suites of offices in Devonshire House, Piccadilly. The ground floor Rootes showroom on Piccadilly is now an Audi showroom.

Imp and Chrysler

The success of BMC&#x27;s Mini made Rootes speed the development of their own small car. A new assembly plant was planned but government was obliging major employers to build new plants where there was surplus labour. Jaguar solved their expansion problem by buying Daimler and its Coventry plant with experienced workforce but Rootes selected a greenfield site by Pressed Steel body works near Glasgow airport in Scotland, at Linwood near Paisley.
The new factory was officially opened in May 1963 and the new rear-engined Hillman Imp went on sale the next day but there were difficulties with industrial relations and, soon, the Imp&#x27;s reliability. The Imp&#x27;s heavy development expenses and slackening sales to USA brought about losses for the Rootes group in both 1962 and 1963.

In February 1964 the owners of the minority holdings in Humber Limited (and Tilling-Stevens and Singer Motors) sold their holdings to Rootes Motors Limited taking in exchange shares in Rootes Motors. Humber and its two subsidiaries now became wholly owned subsidiaries of Rootes Motors Limited.

A last major activity of, by then, Lord Rootes, was to open sale negotiations with Chrysler Corporation. He died in December 1964. Chrysler took control in 1967.

===1967–1976===

The last of the traditional large Humbers, the series VA Super Snipe (fitted with twin Stromberg CD 100 Carburettors) were sold in 1968, when Chrysler ended production. Several V8 models had been in pre-production at this time, but were never publicly sold. Several of these test examples survive today.

Humber&#x27;s and Rootes&#x27; last new car was the second generation of Humber Sceptre, a variant of their Rootes Arrow model. The marque was shelved in 1976 when all Hillmans became badged Chryslers.

The Hillman Hunter (another Arrow model) badged Chrysler until production ceased in 1979 when Chrysler&#x27;s European division was sold to Peugeot and the marque renamed Talbot. The Talbot marque was abandoned at the end of 1986 on passenger cars, although it was continued on vans for six years afterwards.

===After 1976===
In 1986, there was a private initiative to rekindle Humber as a manufacturer of upmarket premium vehicles, employing the recently closed truck and tractor manufacturing facility at Bathgate, in Scotland. This factory had been opened by BMC in 1961, to manufacture their light trucks and tractors. The original plan had been to expand their Longbridge plant for this purpose. The trucks were later marketed as Leyland ‘Redline’

The unused company name of Humber, continued to be still maintained and registered by the new owner Peugeot. A different company, the Humber Motor Company Limited, was therefore incorporated and registered as a means of pursuing this manufacturing proposal. This proposal was vetoed by the local Bathgate councillors. They preferred the idea of a huge “Sales Mall” development on the site in Bathgate, rather than support an initiative that would have involved continued manufacturing employment in the area. The new retail idea was itself turned down by Edinburgh and Glasgow councils. Regrettably, all the Bathgate factory buildings were eventually flattened, and the site was ironically, subsequently, used merely as a distribution centre for a number of other automotive manufacturers.

Humber Motor Company Limited Limited was registered as a Scottish company in August 1986 then dissolved July 2007; &#x27;Humber Motor Company Limited&#x27; was registered in England in June 2007.

Four of Humber Motor Company Limited’s registered trademarks (Sceptre, Hawk, Super Snipe, Snipe) were renewed with the Intellectual Property Office (IPO). The Humber name and logo are also registered trademarks

There is a continuing interest in Humber and the vehicles that it produced. There are very active web-pages frequented by the fans of, and owners of, Humber vehicles.

==Surviving cars==

There is a thriving club, and many of these upmarket cars survive today from before the 1930s.

Until 2020, the world&#x27;s largest collection of the Rootes brothers&#x27; Humber cars (built after 1930) could be viewed at the Marshalls Post-Vintage Humber Car Museum in Hull. It included 21 Humber cars dating from 1932 to 1970 on permanent display, plus 24 unrestored cars. The museum has now closed for good and many of the cars have been sold off.

==Aviation==
Humber produced a number of aircraft and aero-engines in the years before the First World War. In 1909 the company signed a contract to build 40 copies of the Blériot XI monoplane, powered by their own three-cylinder engine, and four aircraft were exhibited at the Aero Show at Olympia in 1910.

During the First World War Humber built the BR1 and BR2 engines designed for Humber by W O Bentley and more engines were built in different factories in Coventry for the Air Ministry during the Second World War.

<text>Christian Erland Harald von Koenigsegg (born July 2, 1972) is a Swedish automotive engineer and entrepreneur. He is a descendant of the House and lineage of the Koenigsegg, a noble family from Germany. He is the founder and CEO of the Swedish high-performance automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg Automotive.

In 1994, Koenigsegg launched the &quot;Koenigsegg project&quot;, which eventually became Koenigsegg Automotive. Together with designer David Crafoord, Koenigsegg created a design concept following his original sketches. The first prototype enabled the foundation of Koenigsegg Automotive. Koenigsegg and his wife, Halldora, are leading the company.

==Early life==
Christian von Koenigsegg is the son of Jesko von Koenigsegg, CEO of JK Energiteknik, and fashionista Brita Aasa. The von Koenigsegg lineage is attested from CE 1171 and originates in Swabia, in the Holy Roman Empire, where his ancestors were knights (see Königsegg for details). The current logo of Koenigsegg Automotive is based on the Königsegg familial coat of arms.
Koenigsegg grew up in Stockholm, and spent a year in high school in Danderyd before enrolling at Lundsbergs boarding school, and then studied economics at the Scandinavian School of Brussels. He showed an interest in cars from an early age, starting at the age of five when he watched the stop-motion film &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot;, about a bicycle builder who built a racing car, &quot;&quot;. When he was six years old, he drove a go-kart for the first time, and he vividly recalls this as &quot;one of the best days of his life&quot;.

== Koenigsegg Automotive ==

Christian von Koenigsegg founded Koenigsegg Automotive AB in 1994 in hopes of producing a &quot;world-class&quot; sports car. This company was financed initially with money from Christian&#x27;s previous business ventures. He also received $200,000 from the Swedish technical development board. Christian&#x27;s father became an early investor and financed the operation for over 3 years. Halldora von Koenigsegg became involved in 2000 as the COO.

<doc id="1172205" wikidata="Q15242536" url="?curid=1172205" title="Liverpool Playhouse">
<text>The Liverpool Playhouse is a theatre in Williamson Square in the city of Liverpool, England. It originated in 1866 as a music hall, and in 1911 developed into a repertory theatre. As such it nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses, some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. Architectural changes have been made to the building over the years, the latest being in 1968 when a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. In 1999 a trust was formed, joining the management of the Playhouse with that of the Everyman Theatre.

==History==
The present theatre on the site was designed by Edward Davies, and opened in 1866. It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall. The present theatre was originally named the Star Music Hall. In 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties. The theatre was improved in 1898 by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer, and electricity was installed. In 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established, with Basil Dean as its &quot;controller and producer&quot;. The company could not afford to build a new theatre, and bought the Star Theatre for £28,000 ). This made it the first repertory in Britain to own the freehold of a theatre. The company spent a further £4,000 () on redesigning and modernising the theatre. The auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead, the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture. The theatre was for many years managed by Maud Carpenter, while Ronald Settle was Musical Director from 1945 to 1971. The theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre, and in 1916 renamed again, as the Liverpool Playhouse. Minor structural alterations were made to the theatre in 1961 and in 1966. In 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop. In the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation. In 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened. It is managed jointly with the Everyman Theatre by Liverpool City Council.

==Artistes==
From 1922 to 1944 the director of the theatre and the repertory company was William Armstrong. According to &quot;The Times&quot;:

Other future stars who learned their craft at the Playhouse under Armstrong included Michael Redgrave, Rex Harrison and Robert Flemyng. Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence worked with the company as child actors. Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include Lilian Braithwaite, Cecil Parker, John Gregson, Clive Brook, C. Aubrey Smith, Richard Burton, Patricia Routledge, Anthony Hopkins, and Richard Briers.

==Architecture==
===Older section===
The exterior of the older part of the theatre is stuccoed, and it has a slate roof. Its entrance front faces Williamson Square. It has seven bays and is in three storeys. The central three bays project forward and are surmounted by a broken pediment. On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances, separated by pillars, which lead to a recessed porch. Over each entrance is an architrave containing a fanlight. The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side, over which are three blind round windows. In the middle storey, the bays are separated by pilasters. The three central bays each have a balustrade and a window with a tympanum containing a roundel. Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a cornice, and a round window above it. Along the top storey are oculi between panelled pilasters. On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a cupola on a short Tuscan colonnade. Inside the older part of the theatre are two balconies supported by cast iron columns. The interior is decorated in Greek Revival style.

===Newer section===
The newer section is constructed in concrete, and largely faced by glass. On the ground floor are entrance doors. Above this, the building is based around three cylinders. The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys. It is cantilevered from a central column. To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder. Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.

===Assessment and critique===
The theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, having been designated on 14 March 1975. In its description, the list quotes the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; of 1968 which says of the older section that it is &quot;significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date&quot;, and of the newer section that it is &quot;a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining Victorian façade&quot;. In the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series the architectural historians Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner say of the newer section that it is &quot;a spectacular composition&quot; which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer&quot;.

<doc id="1172212" wikidata="Q1468959" url="?curid=1172212" title="Hillman Husky">
<text>The Hillman Husky was a line of British passenger vehicles manufactured between 1954 and 1970 by Hillman.

==Original Hillman Husky (&quot;Mark 1&quot;)==

The first (or &quot;Mark 1&quot;) Hillman Husky, introduced in 1954, was a small estate car based on the contemporary &quot;Mark VIII&quot; Hillman Minx. The two-door Husky entered the range alongside an existing Minx estate car, which had a longer wheelbase. The Husky was not a hatchback, having instead a single side-hinged rear door. While the new Mark VIII Minx DeLuxe saloon, convertible and &quot;Californian&quot; hardtop used a new OHV engine, the Husky continued to use the older sidevalve engine with single Zenith carburettor which it shared with the Minx &quot;Special&quot; saloon and estate. Unlike the Minx with its column change, the gear lever for the Husky was floor mounted.

There were individual seats in front and a bench seat in the rear which would fold flat to increase load area. The trim material was leathercloth. Both the heater and radio were optional extras. The car was available in blue, grey, green or sand paint (1954 colours).

42,000 of this Husky were sold until the model was replaced in 1958 (a year after the &quot;parent&quot; Minx was itself replaced).

&quot;The Motor&quot; magazine tested a Husky in 1954 and found it to have a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 24.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £564 including taxes.

==&quot;Audax Series&quot; Hillman Husky==
===Series I===
In 1958 the new &quot;Series I&quot; Husky was introduced. It followed the same formula as its predecessor, but was based on the new &quot;Audax&quot; or &quot;Series&quot; Hillman Minx. This time the engine was the new Minx&#x27;s 1390 cc overhead-valve unit but de-rated to an output of . As before, there was also a four-door &quot;Minx estate&quot;, and the Husky had two doors (plus the side-hinged rear door) and a shorter wheelbase (by ). It was, however, longer than its predecessor.

Again Commer sold a panel van version of the same vehicle as the Commer Cob.

===Series II===
A &quot;Series II&quot; Husky followed in 1960 with a four-speed gearbox, slightly lowered roof, a deeper windscreen, and altered seats. The engine compression ratio was raised to 8:1 and the carburettor changed to a Zenith 30 VIG type.

Testing the Husky in 1960, &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0- of 26.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £674 including taxes.

===Series III===
The final iteration of the &quot;Audax&quot; Hillman Husky, the &quot;Series III&quot;, made its debut in 1963, along with a face-lift for the whole Minx range (and its badge-engineered derivatives). The face-lift bodywork changes were applied to the Husky, but the reduction in wheel size from to , which was applied to the saloons, was not applied to the Husky in order to maintain its ground clearance. In addition, whilst the contemporary Series V Minx got front disc brakes, the Husky continued with four-wheel drum brakes. While the 1390 cc engine continued to be used in most markets, for the USA the Husky adopted the engine used in the contemporary Minx Series V.

From 1964 the Husky gained an all-synchromesh gearbox and changes to the clutch and suspension. Production of the Series III ended in 1965.

==Hillman Imp van derivative==
No further Huskies were made until a new model based on the Hillman Imp appeared in April 1967. This new Husky shared the Imp&#x27;s rear-mounted overhead camshaft engine, and had slightly better performance than the Imp, being approximately lighter. The same engine was also adopted by the Bond 875.

Like the earlier van version, the &quot;Imp estate&quot; was based on the two-door car, with the roof raised by 4 inches (100 mm) to provide a large carrying space above the engine bay, giving the car a square boxy look. The unusually flat roof was reinforced with stiffening ribs and supported on the inside of the vehicle with &quot;synthetic foam noise-deadening material&quot;. When compared to the Commer badged panel van from which it derived, the Husky body also had extra stiffening at the rear window apertures.

Loading access was by a vertical top-hinged rear tailgate with the bottom of the opening level with the floor, making it easy to load without stooping down. Sliding windows gave ventilation and a view out from the rear bench seat. The top part of the back seat squab folded forward forming a useful horizontal loading platform with a ribbed rubber surface, and of capacity. To take the increased load, this was the first Hillman derivative to have radial-ply tyres. It also had uprated rear shock absorbers and rear springs were fitted along with a strengthened rear suspension. These gave the Husky more sporty handling than the standard Imp, and looked surprising when this tall vehicle went quickly round a corner with very little roll.

Once more Commer sold a commercial version of the same car, the van version which was launched in 1965 and had the engine in low-compression form.

The last Husky was built in 1970, at which point Chrysler Europe, new owners of Rootes, engaged in a major rationalisation of their products.

<doc id="1172222" wikidata="Q17100543" url="?curid=1172222" title="Singer Gazelle">
<text>The Singer Gazelle name has been applied to two generations of motor cars from the British manufacturer Singer. It was positioned between the basic Hillman range and the more sporting Sunbeam versions.

==Gazelle I and II==
The Gazelle was the first Singer to be produced following the take-over of the Singer company by the Rootes Group in 1956 and was a version of the mainstream Hillman Minx differing mainly in retaining the Singer overhead cam engine. Externally the only significant difference was a restyled nose based around a traditional Singer grille. The new car was announced in late September 1956.

The body style followed by the Gazelle between 1956 and 1967 came to be known as the &quot;Audax&quot; body, with significant input from the US based Loewy design organisation, highly regarded at the time partly on account of Loewy&#x27;s input to several iconic Studebaker designs.

The Gazelle was initially offered in saloon and convertible body styles. The Gazelle Series II, offered from autumn 1957, was also available as an estate car, and had optional overdrive and larger fuel tank.

The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs while at the rear was a live axle and half elliptic leaf springs. The steering gear used a worm and nut system.

As standard, the car had a bench front seat but individual seats were available as an option. To allow for the bench seat, the handbrake lever was between the seat and the door.

The convertible version had a two position hood where it could be either completely lowered or rolled back to just behind the front seats described as the &quot;coupé de ville&quot; position. All side windows could be completely lowered. To compensate for the loss of body rigidity by the removal of the roof, extra cross bracing was fitted under the car.

A car with overdrive was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1957. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 24.8 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1016 including taxes of £332. This included the optional overdrive, heater and radio.
==Gazelle IIA to IIIC==
The Gazelle II was re-designated as the IIA in 1958. The standard Hillman pushrod overhead valve engine replaced the Singer overhead cam unit. The new engine was more powerful, developing 56 bhp against 49 bhp.

In line with Rootes Group policy, the car kept getting small upgrades each with a new designation. In September 1958 the Gazelle, now re-designated III, received better seats, enhanced at the front by a folding central arm rest. A new two-tone paint became available with this upgrade.

The IIIA, introduced September 1959, gained small tail fins and a larger windscreen. The engine was upgraded with twin Solex carburettors replacing the single Solex, distinguishing it from the Minx, and lifting output to 60 bhp. Home market cars got a floor gear change and as well as overdrive, Smith&#x27;s Easidrive automatic transmission also became an option.

Autocar Magazine carried out a Used Car Test, No.214 in their famous series, on a Singer Gazelle III first registered on 2 January 1961. What is not made clear is whether this was a Gazelle IIIb or an earlier Gazelle IIIa model, fitted with the twin carburettors. In comparison with the new Gazelle IIIb tested on 17 March 1961, it reached 0-60 mph in 23.9secs,compared with the used car at only 19.9secs. A 4sec saving. The standing quarter mile was also covered in 21.3sec. compared with 22.2 for the new IIIb model.

The IIIB, launched September 1960, reverted to a single carburettor which improved fuel consumption and facilitated servicing &quot;in remoter territories&quot;. The IIIB also received a new back axle featuring a hypoid bevel in place of the former model&#x27;s spiral bevel.

The IIIC, launched July 1961, was fitted with a larger engine of 1592 cc developing 53 bhp. The convertible was discontinued in February 1962 followed by the estate car in March 1962.

A Series III convertible with the 1494 cc engine was tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1959. It was recorded as having a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 21.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,003 including taxes of £295. This included the optional overdrive. The convertible cost £67 more than the saloon.

==Gazelle IV==
In July 1961 the Rootes Group released the new Singer Vogue, using the body of what was intended to be the Gazelle IV. As a consequence, the Gazelle IV designation was not used.

==Gazelle V==
The Gazelle V was introduced in August 1963, following the Hillman Minx update. It had an updated body with longer rear doors and no longer having a wrap-around rear window.

The front brakes became discs and from 1964 it gained a new gearbox with synchromesh on first gear. The optional Borg Warner automatic got a floor mounted selector lever.

==Gazelle VI==
The Gazelle VI, which was introduced in 1965, was the last of the &quot;Audax&quot; Gazelles. The engine was all new, with a five-bearing crankshaft and capacity of 1725 cc at first developing 65 bhp but this was later reduced to 59 bhp.

The grille, now rectangular instead of the traditional Singer oval shape, was no longer attached to the opening bonnet but remained fixed to the front panels on opening.
==Gazelle VII==

The Gazelle VII was introduced in 1967 as one of numerous models in the Rootes Arrow range. It was offered only as a 4 door saloon. Initially available only with automatic transmission and a 1725cc engine, subsequently a manual transmission variant with the 1496 cc engine was introduced. Production ceased in 1970, the last example produced also being the last Singer to be built. 
==Australian production==
===Singer Gazelle===
The Singer Gazelle was also produced in Australia from 1957 to 1961 by Rootes Australia. It was offered in Sports Saloon, Station Wagon and Estate Van models.

===Hillman Gazelle===

Following the purchase of Rootes Australia in 1965, Chrysler Australia produced a variant of the Gazelle VI as the Hillman Gazelle.

<doc id="1172224" wikidata="Q623053" url="?curid=1172224" title="Humber Sceptre">
<text>The Humber Sceptre is an automobile which was produced in the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1976 by Humber.

==MK I (1963 to 1965)==

The Humber Sceptre MK I, introduced in 1963, was a luxury car based on the Hillman Super Minx. It featured a unique roof, glass and upper/rear bodywork not shared with the Super Minx or the related Singer Vogue. The Sceptre was originally intended as a four-door replacement for the Sunbeam Rapier, but was launched as a Humber, while the Rapier continued in production with little modification until 1967. This resulted in the Sceptre&#x27;s more sporty character compared to traditional Humbers. The Sceptre was positioned at the top of the mid-range Rootes Group cars, above the Hillman Super Minx and Singer Vogue. It featured similar twin headlight styling to the Vogue and a more powerful version of the Minx engine. The high level of equipment included disc front brakes, overdrive, screen washers, reversing lamp, rev counter and a full range of instruments. Automatic transmission was made available later. A MK IA was introduced in 1964. Whilst the Super Minx and Vogue received revised six light styling in 1964, the Sceptre body continued unchanged until 1965 when it was replaced by the MK II. Production of the MK I and IA models totalled 17,011 units.
==MK II (1965 to 1967)==

The Sceptre MK II, introduced in 1965, featured revised front end styling and a twin carburettor version of the engine. It was produced until 1967. Production of the MK II totalled 11,983 units.

The Mk II series of the Humber Sceptre was a capable car with performance figures recorded by Motor magazine, published in the edition dated 16 April 1966, Maximum 94.8 mph (mean), 0-60 mph 12.5secs, with a standing quarter-mile of 19.5secs.

==MK III (1967 to 1976)==
The Sceptre MK III, introduced in 1967, was a derivative of the Rootes Arrow design and was the best-appointed version of this model offered by Rootes. It continued Humber&#x27;s tradition of building luxury cars and featured wood-veneer fascia, complete instrumentation, adjustable steering column, vinyl roof and extra brightwork on the wheel arches and rear panel. The MK III had a more powerful version of the engine with twin carburettors giving . The manual-gearbox model featured either the D-type or the later J-type Laycock De Normanville overdrive, with the J-type fitted from chassis numbers L3 onwards starting in July 1972. As with all models in the Arrow range, an automatic gearbox was an option. A closer ratio G-type gearbox was fitted to later Sceptres, using the J-type overdrive. An estate car variant of the Sceptre was introduced at the London Motor Show in October 1974. It featured a built-in roof rack and a carpeted loading floor protected by metal strips and illuminated by an additional interior light. Washer and wiper were provided for the rear window, a rare feature on UK-market estate cars of the time.

The Sceptre was discontinued in September 1976, along with the Humber and Hillman marque names. From that time, all models in the Chrysler UK range were branded as Chryslers. Production of the MK III totaled 43,951 units.

==Use of the Sceptre name by Peugeot==
The name &quot;Sceptre&quot; reappeared in 1990 for some SRi versions of the Peugeot 205, 405 and 605. Peugeot had bought Chrysler&#x27;s European operations (which also included French carmaker Simca) in 1978 and rebranded the whole European Chrysler range under the Talbot marque.

<doc id="1172227" wikidata="Q1472978" url="?curid=1172227" title="Sunbeam Rapier">
<text>The Sunbeam Rapier is an automobile produced by Rootes Group from 1955 until 1976, in two different generations, the &quot;Series&quot; cars (which underwent several revisions) and the later (1967–76) fastback shape, part of the &quot;Arrow&quot; range.

The first generation Rapier was the first of the &quot;Audax&quot; range of light cars produced by the Rootes Group, in this instance as part of their Sunbeam marque. Announced at the London Motor Show in October 1955, it preceded its Hillman Minx and Singer Gazelle counterparts which were not introduced until 1956.

A four-seat, two-door hardtop coupé – designated Series I with the introduction of the Series II in 1958 – it was different from the Sunbeam Mark III, the car it would eventually replace. Although designed &quot;in house&quot; by the Rootes Group, it was inspired, via the Raymond Loewy design organisation, by the new-generation Studebaker coupés of 1953.

==Series I==
The styling of the Series I Rapier was undertaken by the design firm of Raymond Loewy Associates and showed a great deal of influence of Raymond Loewy&#x27;s 1953 Studebaker Starliner and subsequent Hawk (itself an acclaimed design). Announced in October 1955 for the Motor Show and available in a range of two-tone colour schemes typical of the period, it had a steering column gear change, Two-tone Kangaroo leather trim and a Laycock de Normanville overdrive as standard fittings. Vinyl trim was an option in the UK and standard in certain export territories. Rapier bodies were built by Pressed Steel, shipped to Thrupp &amp; Maberly in north London where they were painted and trimmed, then shipped again to the Rootes assembly plant at Ryton-on-Dunsmore near Coventry where the engines, transmission and running gear were fitted. This complex situation persisted until late 1963 when the Series IV was introduced.

The Rapier&#x27;s engine was essentially the same as that fitted to the Hillman Minx but with a raised compression ratio (8:1 instead of 7:1), a Zenith DIF 36 carburettor and revised inlet and exhaust manifolds. In this form it developed at 5000 rpm. A column change, 4-speed transmission with overdrive on third and top was included in the price as a standard feature.

From October 1956, directly as a result of experience gained in international rallying by Rootes&#x27; competition department, the Rapier was fitted with the updated R67 engine on which the Stromberg carburettor was replaced by twin Zenith 36 WIP carburettors on a new inlet manifold. This engine produced at 5000 rpm, the effect of which was to reduce the Rapier&#x27;s 0- time by almost 1 second and increase its top speed by .

British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; tested a Series I twin carburettor saloon in 1957, recording a top speed of and acceleration from 0– in 20.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £1043 including taxes of £348.

In competition, a Rapier driven by Peter Harper finished in fifth place in the 1958 Monte Carlo Rally.

In total, 7,477 units were produced of this initial version of the Sunbeam Rapier. It was discontinued in 1958 on the introduction of the Series II.
==Series II==
The Sunbeam Rapier Series II was announced on 6 February 1958, available in hardtop and convertible forms. Rootes arranged for nine of the new cars to be in Monte Carlo for the press to try at the end of the 1958 Monte Carlo Rally.

The traditional Sunbeam radiator grille was reintroduced, albeit shortened and widened and the spaces at its sides were filled with horizontal side grilles. The two-tone lower body colour scheme of the Series I was discontinued in favour of a broad full length flash in the same colour as the roof, but the most obvious change was the appearance on the rear wings of pronounced fins.

The interior of the Series II was little changed from that of the Series I, except that a floor gear change replaced the column change, a modification, developed on the works Series I rally cars. To keep costs down, the leather upholstery, standard on the Series I, was discontinued in favour of vinyl and overdrive became an extra cost option.

An improvement in the Series II though, was its more powerful engine. Referred to as the Rallymaster, it had an increased capacity of . The capacity increase combined with a higher compression ratio of 8.5:1 and larger inlet and exhaust valves to raise the power output to at 5,200 rpm. &quot;Autocar&quot; quoted the top speed as with a 0- time of 20.2 seconds. Also as a direct result of competition experience, the Series II was fitted with larger front brakes and a recirculating ball steering box instead of the worm and nut box of the Series I.

The Series II was discontinued in favour of the Series III in 1959 after 15,151 units (hardtop and convertible) had been built.
==Series III==
The Series III was introduced in September 1959.

Rootes made subtle changes to the car&#x27;s body which individually were insignificant but when combined, considerably altered its appearance. For example, the number of horizontal bars in each of the side grilles was increased from three to four and the boot lid acquired an oblong number plate recess and surround in place of the square one of the earlier cars. The most striking change was the redesigned side flash, now narrower and lower down the side of the car with the Rapier script on its rear end. The most subtle change, however, was a reduction in thickness of the windscreen pillars and a lowering of the scuttle line to give a 20% increase in windscreen area.

Inside the Series III the changes were more evident. Rootes stylists completely redesigned the seats and interior panels and specified that they be trimmed in single colour vinyl with contrasting piping. For the first time, deep pile carpets were fitted as standard in the foot-wells (previous versions had rubber mats). The steering wheel, control knobs and switches were in black plastic instead of beige. The dashboard, instead of being, as in the earlier cars, padded metal and plastic, was covered in burr walnut veneer surmounted by a padded crash roll fitted with black-faced British Jaeger instruments.

Mechanically, the Series III benefited from the design of the Sunbeam Alpine sports car with which it shared its engine. Although the engine&#x27;s displacement was still , it was fitted with a new eight-port aluminium cylinder head with an increased compression ratio and redesigned valves, and used a new, sportier camshaft. The twin Zenith carburettors from the Series II remained but were mounted on a new water heated inlet manifold. The result of these changes was a power increase of 5 bhp to at 5400 rpm.

Gearbox changes included higher second, third and top gear ratios, and a reduced angle of gear lever movement to make for shorter lever travel and snappier changes. New front disc brakes significantly improved the Rapier&#x27;s braking capability and widened its front track to give greater stability and improved road-holding.

A saloon with overdrive was tested by British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1960 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 16.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1045 including taxes. 
The Series III, of which 15,368 units were built (hardtop and convertible) gave way to the Series IIIA in April 1961.
==Series IIIA==
In 1961 the Series IIIA was announced with the Series II Sunbeam Alpine engine.
Externally and internally the Series IIIA was identical to the Series III. The improvements were directed solely at improving the durability of the car. To this end, engine capacity was increased and a stiffer crankshaft fitted. To increase reliability, the crankshaft incorporated larger diameter connecting rod bearings which called for modifications to the connecting rods and gudgeon pins. Modified oil and water pumps completed the engine changes. As a result, power output increased from to at 5,100 rpm and torque increased from at 3500 rpm to at 3,900 rpm.
In addition, the Series IIIA included many detail changes such as an increased diameter front anti-roll bar which greatly improved roadholding, a redesigned clutch bell housing, a revised clutch assembly with nine pressure springs instead of six and a redesigned air cleaner assembly. Inside the car a fresh-air heater, hitherto available only at extra cost, became a standard fitting. All of these changes combined to make the Series IIIA subtly different from its predecessor and to give the Sunbeam Rapier a new lease of life in the showroom. 

Maximum speed for the Series IIIA was lower than the Series III at . It also took longer than the Series III to get to (19.3 seconds) but its engine was far more durable.

In mid 1963, the Series IIIA convertible was discontinued but the hardtop soldiered on until October 1963 when it was replaced by the Series IV. When production of the Series IIIA ceased, 17,354 units had been built.
==Series IV==

Late in 1963, Rootes were set to discontinue the Rapier. It was no longer the mainstay of the competitions department because Rootes had directed its motor sport effort towards the Hillman Imp and the Sunbeam Tiger. In fact a totally new Series IV Rapier had been designed, prototypes built and testing completed, and then the Rootes Group changed its focus. The proposed &#x27;Series IV&#x27; became the Mark I Humber Sceptre and the old Series IIIA Rapier was redesigned, hopefully to give it a new lease of life as a touring saloon rather than a sports coupé.
The most obvious difference was the change to road wheels in common with the rest of Rootes&#x27; light car range. This meant that the stainless steel wheel trims of earlier Rapiers were replaced by Rootes corporate hub caps and rim finishers. At the front, the car was redesigned to make it look more up-to-date. A new bonnet made the front look lower and flatter and the front wings were modified to accept extensions housing alloy side grilles and sidelights with amber turn indicators. The traditional Sunbeam grille, already stylised for the Series II, was further modified to give a lower, more square shape with a pronounced convex profile. New headlamp rims were fitted, in fact Sunbeam Alpine items but chromed for the Rapier, and a new front bumper using the same shape and profile as the rest of the Light Car range. At the back, a new full width number plate plinth appeared with a new Light Car range bumper. To give a more open look from the side, the frames were removed from the side windows. Finally, small badges fitted at the bottom of each front wing and on the boot lid proclaimed each car to be a &quot;Series IV&quot;.

Inside, a new dash, still in walnut veneer, but with the glove box raised into the dash itself allowed the inclusion of a proper storage shelf on each side of the car. Instrumentation and controls were much as before except that the heater switches and ashtray were now housed in a console in front of the gear lever. To aid driver comfort, an adjustable steering column was fitted along with new front seats which allowed more fore and aft adjustment and for the first time, included backrest adjustment.

In common with the rest of the light car range, the Rapier&#x27;s front suspension was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A brake servo became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new diaphragm clutch and new clutch master cylinder brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.

The engine from the Series IIIA was unchanged but the twin Zenith carburettors finally gave way to a single twin-choke Solex 32PAIA in the interests of serviceability. The effect of the new carburettor was to increase power to and torque to at 3,500 rpm.

In October 1964, along with the rest of the light car range, the Series IV received the new Rootes all synchromesh gearbox, a change which coincided with the introduction of a new computerised chassis numbering system.

The &quot;Motor&quot; road test of April 1964 gave the Series IV Rapier&#x27;s maximum speed as and its 0- time as 17 seconds.

When production of the Series IV ceased in 1965, 9700 units had been built.

==Series V==

Pending completion of the new Fastback Rapier, Rootes released one more update of the Sunbeam Rapier. In September 1965 they introduced the Series V version which looked exactly like the Series IV inside and out except for badges on wings and boot which now said &quot;1725&quot;, revealing a re-developed engine.

Rootes redesigned the Rapier&#x27;s four-cylinder engine to increase the capacity, with a new five main bearing crankshaft, making the unit stronger and smoother. This engine would be developed for many subsequent models. In the Series V Rapier the engine developed at 5,500 rpm.

To further update the car, they changed its polarity from positive to negative earth and fitted an alternator in place of the dynamo. They also devised a new twin pipe exhaust system so that the new engine could breathe more easily.

The effect of these changes was to increase the Rapier&#x27;s maximum speed to and reduce its time from rest to to 14.1 seconds. However, for all its improvements, the Series V just did not sell. By the time it was discontinued in June 1967, only 3,759 units had been built, making it the rarest of all the &quot;Series&quot; Sunbeam Rapiers.
==Sunbeam Rapier Fastback coupé==

By 1967 Rootes&#x27; &quot;Arrow&quot; range was ready. As well as the Hillman Hunter, the range also included a new generation of Sunbeam Rapiers, with fastback coupé bodies and a sporty image. Like the earlier Series I to Series V models, it was a two-door pillarless hardtop.

The Arrow Rapier – or Fastback, as it came to be known – launched in October 1967, was a four-seat coupé based on the chassis of the Hillman Hunter Estate. Although the Rapier used the tail lamps and rear valance from the Hunter Estate, the rest of its superstructure was unique.

The Rapier used the Rootes four-cylinder, five-bearing engine, which was tilted slightly to the right to enable a lower bonnet line, in common with the other Arrow models. With its twin Stromberg 150CD carburettors the engine produced at 5200 rpm. Overdrive was standard with the manual gearbox, and Borg-Warner automatic transmission was an optional extra.

The Fastback Rapier continued almost unchanged until 1976, when it was discontinued without a replacement. During its lifetime it formed the basis for the more powerful Sunbeam Rapier H120, introduced in October 1968 and identifiable by its boot-lid spoiler and polished sill covers: it shared its Holbay Engineering-tuned engine (with twin Weber carburettors) with the Hillman Hunter GLS. The Rapier was also the basis for the slightly cheaper but similarly bodied, single-carburettor Sunbeam Alpine Fastback introduced in October 1969. Rapier running gear (though not the estate chassis) was also used in the Humber Sceptre MkIII, Hillman GT and Hillman Hunter GT models from the Arrow range.

Between 1967 and 1969, the Rapier was built at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, but from 1969 until its demise in 1976, it was built at Rootes&#x27; Hillman Imp factory at Linwood in Scotland. In all, 46,204 units were built (including Rapier, H120 and Alpine versions).

Maximum speed of the Rapier was and it could reach from rest in 12.8 seconds.

In the United States, the Rapier was marketed as the Sunbeam Alpine GT.

===Sunbeam Alpine Fastback coupé===

The Sunbeam Alpine Fastback, introduced in October 1969, was essentially a Rapier with a simplified specification, developed to fill a gap in the Arrow range above the Singer Vogue. It used the same engine as the Hillman Hunter which, fitted with a single Stromberg 150CD carburettor, developed at 5500 rpm. Transmission options included overdrive on cars with a manual gearbox or a Borg-Warner automatic transmission.

The Alpine, though well equipped, was less sporty in style than the Rapier. It had a wooden dashboard with fewer instruments, instead of the Rapier&#x27;s cowled plastic one, and wood instead of metal on the transmission tunnel. There were also different wheel trims, no aluminium sill finishers (nor the polished ones of the H120) and no vinyl trim on its C-pillars. Above all at £1086 in the UK it was significantly (for the time) cheaper than the £1200 Rapier.

Maximum speed of the Alpine was and it could reach from rest in 14.6 seconds.

The Fastback Alpine was discontinued in 1975, before the Rapier and H120.
===Sunbeam Rapier H120===

To produce a faster version of the Fastback Rapier, Rootes developed the H120. Based on the Rapier, the H120 had a more powerful version of the engine specially developed by Holbay Engineering. It produced (gross) at 5,200 rpm ,163nm at 4000rpm and was fitted with a special cylinder head, high lift camshaft, tuned length four-branch exhaust manifold, special distributor and twin Weber 40DCOE carburetters. The H120 had a close ratio gearbox, a heavy duty overdrive, and a high ratio rear axle.
To add to its sporty image, the H120 had wider Rostyle wheels, broad side flashes, polished sill covers, a matt black radiator grille and a new boot lid incorporating a faired-in spoiler. To further distinguish the model from others in the range, it had H120 badges on the front wings and in the centre of the grille.

Maximum speed of the H120 was and it could reach from standstill in 11.1 seconds.

The H120 was discontinued with the Fastback Rapier in 1976.

<text>Aftermath was a super hero comic book imprint published by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing. A of Josh Blaylock, the new imprint aimed to establish a new, accessible, continuity-free universe that could later be expanded into a series of multi-media franchises. The imprint drew inspirations from comic book superheroes, as well pulp fiction, various cult genres and modern-day pop culture.

Aftermath premiered in 2004 with four comic book titles (in order of debut): &quot;Defex&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot;, the &quot;Blade of Kumori&quot;, and &quot;Infantry&quot;. Each title was based on a concept conceived by Josh Blaylock, who provided the basic outline and the loose framework which connected those titles. Each creative team was given considerably leeway to develop those concepts as they saw fit. For the initial arc, the idea of the shared universe was deemphasized in favor of giving each title its own identity.

By spring 2005, it became clear that sales were not large enough to support the line. Josh Blaylock canceled all titles with the intention of relaunching Aftermath Universe as a single title that would involve characters from all prior titles and introduce new characters (in essence, an imprint-wide crossover). However, after looking at sales figures, Devil Due&#x27;s staff came to the conclusion that any attempt to revive the line would not be financially viable. As of this writing, there has been no effort to revive the Aftermath Universe.

Due to the abruptness of the initial cancellation, only Defex and Breakdown were able to finish their initial story arc. Blade of Kumori and Infantry were cancelled after five and four issues, respectively.

<doc id="1172230" wikidata="Q429406" url="?curid=1172230" title="Saponification value">
<text>Saponification value or saponification number (SV or SN) represents the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) required to saponify one gram of fat under the conditions specified. It is a measure of the average molecular weight (or chain length) of all the fatty acids present in the sample in form of triglycerides. The higher the saponification value, the lower the fatty acids average length, the lighter the mean molecular weight of triglycerides and vice versa. Practically, fats or oils with high saponification value (such as coconut and palm oil) are more suitable for soap making.

== Determination ==
To determine saponification value, the sample is treated with an excess of alkali (usually an ethanolic solution of potassium hydroxide) for half an hour under reflux. The KOH is consumed by reaction with triglycerides, which consume three equivalents of base. Diglycerides consume two equivalents of KOH. Monoglycerides and free fatty acids, as well as other esters such as lactones, consume one equivalent of base. At the end of the reaction the quantity of KOH is determined by titration using standard solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Key to the method is the use of phenolphthalein indicator, which indicates the consumption of strong base (KOH) by the acid, not the weak base (potassium carboxylates). The SV (mg KOH/ g of sample) is calculated as following:
 &lt;/math&gt;|1}}

:where:
:formula_1 is the volume of HCl solution used for the blank run, in mL;
:formula_2 is the volume of HCl solution used for the tested sample, in mL;
:formula_3 is the molarity of HCl solution, in mol / L;
: is the molecular weight of KOH, in g / mol;
:formula_4 is the weight of sample, in g.

For example, standard methods for determination of SV of vegetable and animal fats are as follows:
The SV can also be calculated from the fatty acid composition as determined by gas chromatography (AOCS Cd 3a-94).

Handmade soap makers who aim for bar soap use sodium hydroxide (NaOH), commonly known as lye, rather than KOH (caustic potash) which produces soft paste, gel or liquid soaps. In order to calculate the lye amount needed to make bar soap, KOH values of SV can be converted to NaOH values by dividing KOH values by the ratio of the molecular weights of KOH and NaOH (1.403).

== Calculation of average molecular weight of fats and oils ==
The theoretical SV of a pure triglyceride molecule can be calculated by the following equation (where MW is its molecular weight):
:where: 
:3 is the number of fatty acids residues per triglyceride
:1000 is the conversion factor for milligrams to grams
:56.1 is the molar mass of KOH.
:38.049 is the molecular mass of glycerol backbone

For instance, triolein, a triglyceride occurring in many fats and oils, has three oleic acid residues esterified to a molecule of glycerol with a total MW of 885.4 (g / mol). Therefore, its SV equals 190 mg KOH / g sample. In comparison, trilaurin with three shorter fatty acid residues (lauric acid) has a MW of 639 and an SV of 263.

As it can be seen from equation (2), the SV of a given fat is inversely proportional to its molecular weight. Actually, as fats and oils contain a mix of different triglycerides species, the average MW can be calculated according to the following relation:

This means that coconut oil with an abundance of medium chain fatty acids (mainly lauric acid) contain more fatty acids per unit of weight than, for example, olive oil (mainly oleic acid). Consequently, more ester saponifiable functions were present per g of coconut oil, which means more KOH is required to saponify the same amount of matter, and thus a higher SV. The calculated molecular weight (Eq. 3) is not applicable to fats and oils containing high amounts of unsaponifiable material, free fatty acids (&gt; 0.1%), or mono- and diacylglycerols (&gt; 0.1%).

== Unsaponifiables ==

Unsaponifiables are components of a fatty substance (oil, fat, wax) that fail to form soaps when treated with alkali and remain insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. For instance, typical soybean oil contains, by weight, 1.5 – 2.5% of unsaponifiable matter. Unsaponifiables include nonvolatile components : alkanes, sterols, triterpenes, fatty alcohols, tocopherols and carotenoids as well as those that mainly result from the saponification of fatty esters (sterols esters, wax esters, tocopherols esters, ...). This fraction may also contain environmental contaminants and residues of plasticizers, pesticides, mineral oil hydrocarbons and aromatics.

Unsaponifiable constituents are an important consideration when selecting oil mixtures for the manufacture of soaps. Unsaponifiables can be beneficial to a soap formula because they may have properties such as moisturization, conditioning, antioxidant, texturing etc. On the other hand, when proportion of unsaponifiables is too high (&gt; 3%), or the specific unsaponifiables present do not provide significant benefits, a defective or inferior soap product can result. For example, shark oil is not suitable for soap making as it may contain more than 10% of unsaponifiable matter.

For edible oils, the tolerated limit of unsaponifiable matter is 1.5% (olive, refined soybean), while inferior quality crude or pomace oil could reach 3%.

Determination of unsaponifiables involves a saponification step of the sample followed by extraction of the unsaponifiable using an organic solvent (i.e. diethyl ether). Official methods for animal and vegetable fats and oils are described by ASTM D1065 - 18, ISO 3596: 2000 or 18609: 2000, AOCS method Ca 6a-40.

<text>Then Play On is the third studio album by the British blues rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 19 September 1969. It was the first of their original albums to feature Danny Kirwan (although two tracks recorded with him were included on the compilation album &quot;The Pious Bird of Good Omen&quot; released earlier in 1969) and the last with Peter Green. Although still an official band member at the time, Jeremy Spencer did not feature on the album apart from &quot;a couple of piano things&quot; (according to Mick Fleetwood in &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 1990). The album offered a broader stylistic range than the straightforward electric blues of the group&#x27;s first two albums, displaying elements of folk rock, hard rock, art rock and psychedelia. The album reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the band&#x27;s fourth Top 20 LP in a row, as well as their third album to reach the Top 10. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Then Play On&quot;, is taken from the opening line of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;—&quot;If music be the food of love, play on&quot;.

&quot;Then Play On&quot; is Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s first release with Reprise Records after being lured away from Blue Horizon and a one-off single with Immediate Records. The label would be the band&#x27;s home until their self-titled 1975 album, after which they signed to Reprise&#x27;s parent company Warner Records. The initial US release of the album omitted two tracks that were previously issued on the American compilation album &quot;English Rose&quot;, while the second US pressing further abridged the tracklist with the addition of the hit single &quot;Oh Well&quot;. The original CD compiled all the songs from the two US LP versions, both of which omitted the &quot;English Rose&quot; tracks that are on the original UK version. In August 2013, a remastered edition of the album was reissued on vinyl and CD. This version includes all the tracks from all previous versions of the album, with the original 1969 UK track listing as the main album and both parts of &quot;Oh Well&quot;, as well as the 1970 non-album single &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)&quot; and its B-side &quot;World in Harmony&quot;, as bonus tracks.

==Background==
Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s previous albums had been recorded live in the studio and adhered strictly to the blues formula. For the recording of &quot;Then Play On&quot;, editing and overdubbing techniques were used extensively for the first time. Fleetwood was adamant about veering away from material that was strictly blues-oriented and told Samuel Graham in a 1978 interview that &quot;we didn&#x27;t have an exact concept of what we were going to do, but we knew what we weren&#x27;t going to do, and that was put out another record of Jeremy singing Elmore James.

Jeremy Spencer attended some of the studio sessions and attempted to record a few things for &quot;Then Play On&quot;, but none of his contributions appeared on any of the album&#x27;s original tracks. Fleetwood said that the band was &quot;stylistically two bands in one&quot; at the time; this was reflected in their live setlists, which consisted of conventional blues compositions and rock-and-roll covers with Spencer onstage and another portion of the show without Spencer primarily dedicated to extended jams. Green was opposed to the idea of including disparate styles on &quot;Then Play On&quot;, so the original plan was to release an EP of Spencer compositions to coincide with the album, but the EP was not commercially issued until 1998, when the tracks were included on the band&#x27;s 1998 compilation album, &quot;The Vaudeville Years&quot;. In a 1989 interview with &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, John McVie labeled this EP as his favorite material he ever recorded with Fleetwood Mac.

Green and Spencer also considered the idea of recording a concept album – &quot;an orchestral-choral LP&quot; – about the life of Jesus Christ, although the album never materialised. Instead, Spencer released a solo album in 1970 with the members of Fleetwood Mac as his backing band. Spencer later said in a 2012 interview that he had only discussed this idea with Green &quot;in passing&quot; and that the project was never seriously pursued.

==Recording==
Green, the de facto band leader at the time, delegated half of the songwriting to bandmate Danny Kirwan. Music journalist Anthony Bozza remarked that Green &quot;was a very generous band leader in every single way. And Peter gave Danny all of that freedom. You just don’t hear about things like that&quot;. Several of Kirwan&#x27;s tracks, including &quot;One Sunny Day&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot;, and &quot;Coming Your Way&quot;, were originally recorded on 6 October 1968. At the time, &quot;Coming Your Way&quot; carried the working title &quot;Going My Way&quot;. These songs were later re-recorded and remixed for &quot;Then Play On&quot;, with sessions for &quot;Coming Your Way&quot; and &quot;Although The Sun is Shining&quot; beginning in April 1969. Christine McVie, who at the time was known by her maiden name Christine Perfect, played piano on &quot;Coming Your Way&quot;. Kirwan played all of the guitar parts on &quot;Coming Your Way&quot;, &quot;My Dream&quot; and &quot;Although the Sunshine is Shining&quot; as Green wanted him become more independent and proficient in the recording studio.

Much of the album&#x27;s mixing was conducted by Green and Martin Birch, who served as the album&#x27;s audio engineer. When the two were working on the two Madge jams, Birch employed panning on the guitar tracks to create the impression of a &quot;guitar duel&quot; between Green and Kirwan. Birch recalled that Green would frequently come into the recording studio with a demo he had recorded at home on his Revox. Once Birch understood the general feel of the song, the rest of the band would record the basic tracks. He said that the other members would then leave the studio, leaving himself and Green to work on the song until all of the parts were recorded. He would then repeat the same process with Kirwan and alternate between the two songwriters until the album was complete.

The band began to embrace jamming in their live performances around the time &quot;Then Play On&quot; was developed. Three of the tracks on the album, including &quot;Underway&quot;, &quot;Searching for Madge&quot;, and &quot;Fighting for Madge&quot;, were compiled by Green from several hours of studio jam sessions. Green told Gianluca Tramontana of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in a 2001 interview that &quot;Underway&quot; was a free-form composition that was created collectively by the band through jamming, adding that &quot;it was what I used to play before I had my problems.&quot; The full 16 minute version of the jam was later included on &quot;The Vaudeville Years&quot;. &quot;Searching for Madge&quot; was pieced together with five snippets of tape from an extended jam session.

&quot;Before the Beginning&quot;, a Green composition, was first developed in January 1969 during the recording sessions that later produced the band&#x27;s &quot;Man of the World&quot; single. At the time, &quot;Before the Beginning&quot; was titled &quot;Blues in B flat minor&quot; and lacked the vocals found on the &quot;Then Play On&quot; recording. Green had expressed interest in recording many of the instruments on the album himself, including bass guitar and drums. He played percussion on a few tracks, including some timpani parts. Green wrote &quot;Closing My Eyes&quot; during a time of spiritual awakening and was reading extensively about the Bible. &quot;[It] was written around the time I had such a great faith in Jesus that I felt I was walking and talking with God. I wanted to tell people about it, but they turned it round and tried to shatter my dreams.&quot;

==Release==
In the United States &quot;One Sunny Day&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot; were not included on the album, as they had already been included on the compilation album &quot;English Rose&quot;. &quot;Then Play On&quot; was quickly followed by the non-album single &quot;Oh Well&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Oh Well&quot; was not initially released as a single in the US, as the band&#x27;s then-manager Clifford Davis felt album track &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; would be a better choice for US single release, although the song did not chart despite Davis&#x27; expectations that it would be commercially successful. After the failure of &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot;, &quot;Oh Well&quot; was chosen as the next single for the US market. &quot;Oh Well&quot; fared much better than &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; and became band&#x27;s first song to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Davis had also recorded a cover of Green&#x27;s &quot;Before the Beginning&quot; with members of Fleetwood Mac serving as his backing band. The recording was adorned with orchestral overdubs and coupled with a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Man of the World&quot;, both of which were released in October.

On January 1970, &quot;Then Play On&quot; was reissued in the US, this time with &quot;Oh Well&quot; in place of &quot;When You Say&quot; and &quot;My Dream&quot;. The 2013 remastered CD has the original UK album as tracks 1 to 14 with parts 1 and 2 of &quot;Oh Well&quot;, the 1970 non-album single &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)&quot; and its B-side &quot;World in Harmony&quot; as tracks 15 to 18.

Spencer expressed disappointment with the album, saying that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t complete&quot; and &quot;lacked humour.&quot; However, Fleetwood called &quot;Then Play On&quot; his favourite Fleetwood Mac album. Green was also pleased with the album, saying that he &quot;loved every minute of it. There is nothing I feel I could have done better.&quot; However, he believed that the band made a mistake in producing the album themselves and said that they &quot;should have kept Mike Vernon&quot;, who had produced the band&#x27;s first two albums. Vernon agreed with Green&#x27;s assessment and said that he felt &quot;disappointed&quot; with the album due to his belief that it sounded too &quot;synthetic&quot;.

==Artwork==
The painting used for the album cover artwork is a mural by the English artist Maxwell Armfield. The painting was featured in the February 1917 edition of &quot;The Countryside&quot; magazine, which noted that the mural was originally designed for the dining room of a London mansion. According to Christine McVie, the painting belonged to Fleetwood&#x27;s sister.

==Reception==
Contemporary reception of the album was mixed. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, John Morthland said Fleetwood Mac had fallen &quot;flat on their faces&quot;, and later dismissed the album as mostly &quot;nondescript ramblings&quot;. On the other hand, Robert Christgau was more positive. He described the album&#x27;s mixing of &quot;easy ballads and Latin rhythms with the hard stuff&quot; as &quot;odd&quot; but &quot;very good&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the album, saying that it would &quot;enhance&quot; the Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s reputation and &quot;surprise anyone who thinks of them as a straight, bashing blues band.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; characterised &quot;Then Play On&quot; as &quot;an interesting, progressive LP&quot; that &quot;may not please their blues fans.&quot; 
However, more recent reviews of the album are highly positive; &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; labeling the album as a &quot;cool, blues-based stew&quot; and considered it the second best Fleetwood Mac album. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described &quot;Then Play On&quot; as a &quot;musically expansive, soft edged, psychedelic blues odyssey&quot;. Clark Collins of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine gave the album five stars out of five, and described &quot;Oh Well&quot; as an &quot;epic blues-pop workout&quot;.

==Track listing==

=== Alternate track listings ===
Original US LP, September 1969

The two songs (&quot;One Sunny Day&quot; &amp; &quot;Without You&quot;) deleted from the US version of the LP had already appeared on the US compilation &quot;English Rose&quot;, and &quot;Underway&quot; was shortened by about 15 seconds.

Revised US LP, January 1970

When the double-sided single &quot;Oh Well (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot; (released November 1969) became a hit, the US LP was re-released in January 1970 with a revised running order to include &quot;Oh Well&quot;, dropping Danny Kirwan&#x27;s &quot;When You Say&quot; and &quot;My Dream&quot; to make room for it. The two parts of &quot;Oh Well&quot; differ widely, the first being hard rock, the latter a meditative instrumental, on which Green played cello.

Other changes include putting the two edits from the &quot;Madge&quot; jams back-to-back, fading down between them. The giggle that previously linked &quot;My Dream&quot; to &quot;Like Crying&quot; ended up, in the previous edit, following the end of &quot;Fighting for Madge&quot; instead. Madge, the press were told at the time, was a female fan of the group.

===Unreleased bonus EP: &quot;The Milton Schlitz Show&quot;===
The original intention was to include a bonus EP in the &quot;Then Play On&quot; album. The EP was to be compensation for the fact that Jeremy Spencer barely appeared on the album. The EP consisted of Spencer&#x27;s parodies of doo wop (&quot;Ricky Dee and the Angels&quot;), Alexis Korner, country blues (&quot;Texas Slim&quot;), acid rock (&quot;The Orange Electric Squares&quot;), and John Mayall (&quot;Man of Action&quot;). It was finally released on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;The Vaudeville Years&quot; compilation in 1998.

<doc id="1172239" wikidata="Q6548667" url="?curid=1172239" title="Lim Chu Kang">
<text>Lim Chu Kang is a planning area located in the northwestern part of the North Region of Singapore, bordering the Western Water Catchment to the west and south, Sungei Kadut to the east and the Straits of Johor to the north.

==History==
Lim Chu Kang Village was founded by Neo Ao Tiew (; 1884 - 1975), a Chinese immigrant from Fujian who was the sheriff of the village. &quot;Lim&quot; was taken from Lim Chwee Chian who was the kangchu, or leader, of the area. The village is on the banks of the Sungei Kranji and was controlled by the Lim clan. Neo Tiew also set up a primary school and health centre in the village. Neo Tiew Road is named after him. The area was originally noted for its numerous pepper and gambier plantations. Later there were rubber plantations, e.g. Namazie-Cashin rubber estates.

===Japanese occupation of Singapore===
Lim Chu Kang was one of the locations where the Imperial Japanese Army first landed on the north-western coastline on 8 February 1942 during the Invasion of Singapore of the World War II, catching the defending 22nd Brigade Australian soldiers by surprise. The battle was fought over the night between the Imperial Japanese Army and Australian soldiers, which saw some 360 Australian soldiers killed despite having inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese soldiers.

===Ama Keng Village===
Ama Keng Village (亞媽宮村) was one of the three villages in the Lim Chu Kang, together with Neo Tiew and Sungei Gedong. It takes its name from the Mazu, the goddess of the sea in 1900. In the 1950s, the government developed the bustling farming site to serve as the main food production centre. In 1980s, residents of the Ama Keng were resettled and all eventually moved out to Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang and Yew Tee. After the last resident left, on 10 April 2002, the SAF took possession of the entire Ama Keng for military training use. On 27 September 2012, an SAF serviceman died during training in the camp. After the removal of the military training area in Tengah by 2016, it became the largest training ground for the Lim Chu Kang and Keat Hong camps.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Ama Keng was well-served by shops, a police station as well as a maternity and child welfare centre. All these were closed down by 1990. The Ama Keng English School was founded in 1951 and was moved to Choa Chu Kang in 1990 and renamed to South View Primary School. The old school building became a workers&#x27; quarters and military training ground.

===Neo Tiew===
Neo Tiew is named after Neo Ao Tiew (梁後宙, a prominent Chinese businessman. Neo is credited with the development of the Lim Chu Kang area, where he built roads, houses and a seaport. He was also the founder and sheriff of Lim Chu Kang Village. In 1967, the British colonial government named a 3.5km stretch of road &quot;Neo Tiew Road&quot; or &quot;Neo Tiew Lane&quot; in recognition of his contributions to the area.

On 17 February 2011, most parts of Neo Tiew became a military training area.

===Sungei Gedong===
In the 1960s, Sungei Gedong Road was lined with shophouses and cinemas. A major plan by the government to move residents into HDB flats have seen the decline of the small town. A small HDB estate which was opposite Lim Chu Kang Road was built in the early 1980s, but had been cleared by the late 1990s and expanded the Sungei Gedong Camp&#x27;s military training area in 2000s.

On 11 July 2001, SAF took possession of the entire Sungei Gedong for military training area.

===Lim Chu Kang Bus Terminal===
In the 1980s, Lim Chu Kang Road End Bus Terminal was served by Services 172 (to Shenton Way Bus Terminal and later shortened to loop at Jalan Anak Bukit) and 206 (to Jurong Bus Interchange and later amended to Boon Lay Bus Interchange.)

On 3 January 1993, route 172 was amended to Boon Lay Interchange. On 18 July 1993, new service 175 was introduced from Lim Chu Kang to Upper Bukit Timah Road (Loop) replacing route 206 which was withdrawn. In 2005 service 175 was shortened to Bukit Panjang, amended to loop at the Lim Chu Kang Road End and renumbered service 975. The bus stop is renamed as Police Coast Guard.

===BBC Far Eastern Relay Station===
In 1978 the BBC Far Eastern Relay Station began broadcasting radio programmes addressing the largest audiences in Asia of the BBC World Service from Kranji. Closure of the site was announced in July 2023.

==Today==
Today, Lim Chu Kang is still largely rural and is located in close proximity with the Western Water Catchment. Lim Chu Kang is served by two main roads known as Lim Chu Kang Road and Old Choa Chu Kang Road. As this area is still undeveloped, its land use primarily consists of military training areas, agriculture, farms, the only remaining cemeteries in Singapore (due to exhumations in others to make way for new developments) and a major cinerarium. There are also side-roads, like Jalan Sungei Poyan, Lim Chu Kang Road Track 11/13 and Jalan Bahtera.

The area will not be used for residential purposes in the near future or in the Land Use Plan 2030. Rather, it will largely retain its agricultural and military value. The 62 farms in the western part of Lim Chu Kang are being cleared progressively from April 2020 and completing in December 2022, to make way for military training areas.

Various types of farms where sustainable agriculture is practiced such as vegetable, goat and crocodile farms give city dwellers an insight on nature. It has also been an increasingly popular exploration for tourists in recent years, due in part to its close proximity to the Kranji MRT station.

===Ama Keng Chinese Temple===
The Ama Keng Chinese Temple (亞媽宮) in Lim Chu Kang was built in 1900 to worship Mazu, the holy mother, a goddess of peace and happiness. &quot;Ama&quot; means &quot;grandmother&quot; in Teochew and Hokkien, and &quot;keng&quot; means &quot;temple&quot;. The &quot;incense ashes&quot; of this temple were brought in from Wak Hai Cheng Bio Temple (粵海清廟), the oldest Teochew temple in Singapore. The first temple was made of attap. The temple was renovated in 1943 with a zinc roof and timber. In 1965, it was redeveloped with a tiled roof, and the renovations cost S$16,000. The temple holds wayang performances a few times a year. In the late 1980s, the government acquired the temple&#x27;s land for military purposes. The temple committee, residents and devotees attempted to petition against the acquisition without success, and the temple was eventually demolished.

===Lim Chu Kang Rural Centre===
In 1979, a Housing Development Board estate was constructed in Neo Tiew. In addition to public housing units, a wet market and an old playground were also constructed in this estate. In 2002, the entire estate was sold back to the government in an en-bloc sale; its residents moved to newly built housing units in Jurong West. The remains of the old housing estate are currently used by the Singapore Armed Forces for their Fighting in Built-Up Areas (FIBUA) training from 2004, which has restricted access and only accessible from the Sungei Gedong Camp (TRMC) Operations Room. In 2012, the site was used for the shooting of a war scene in the film, &quot;Ah Boys to Men&quot;.

<text>&quot;&quot; (, ) is the national anthem of Kenya.

==History==
&quot;Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu&quot;&#x27;s lyrics were originally written in Kiswahili, the national language of Kenya. The commission responsible for its creation included five members and was headed by the Kenya Music Adviser. The anthem was based on a traditional tune sung by Pokomo mothers to their children.

&quot;Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu&quot; is notable for being one of the first national anthems to be specifically commissioned. It was written by the Kenyan Anthem Commission in 1963 to serve as the state anthem after independence from the United Kingdom. The lyrics was intended to express the deepest convictions and highest aspirations of the people.

<doc id="1172241" wikidata="Q4081244" url="?curid=1172241" title="Vilnius BASIC">
<text>Vilnius BASIC, sometimes known as BK BASIC, is a dialect of the BASIC programming language running on the Elektronika BK-0010-01/BK-0011M and UKNC computers. It was developed at Vilnius University, located in Lithuania which was a republic of the Soviet Union at the time.

In contrast to most microcomputer dialects of BASIC of the era, which were interpreters, Vilnius BASIC was a compile and go language that compiled the source when the user entered the codice_1 command. It was otherwise similar to GW-BASIC and MSX BASIC in style and most features, although it lacked some of the multimedia commands found in MSX. One oddity was that it did not allow more than one statement on a single line, a feature normally implemented using the colon. It also lacked the ability to open more than one data file at a time.

Only the UKNC version had a full-screen editor, versions of the 0010 series machines used a line editor. Machine-dependent features, like graphics operators, parameters, and codice_2 addresses were also different among the machines.

==Description==
===Program editing===
In contrast to most BASIC dialects of the era, Vilnius BASIC was a compile and go system, not an interpreter. When the user types , the compiler reads the code and produces a threaded code executable that it then ran. Nevertheless, this detail was largely invisible to the user, as the system still allowed statements to be typed in without a line number for direct (immediate) mode, or with a number for indirect mode in which case the new line was added to the program or replaced the same-numbered line if it already existed.

By the late 1970s, most microcomputer dialects offered a full-screen editor, in which the user can use the cursor keys to move around the program and type changes into any visible line of code. The Electronica systems were emulating an PDP-11, machines that had been built in the era before cursor-addressable computer terminals were widely available and thus retain the older line editor style. In these systems, a prompt is displayed that allows the user to type in one line of code, or recall a previously typed line and then edit it in-place.

===Commands and statements===
The list of keywords supported in Vilnius can be separated into two groups, those that can only be used in direct mode, and those that can be direct or indirect.

The former, known as commands, included the common . load and save programs to cassette tape. turned on automatic line number entry, renumbered the lines in the current program, and deleted ranges of lines using the same &quot;to&quot; format as LIST, for instance, would delete everything from the start of the program up to an including line 200.

Vilnius&#x27; primitives were similar to other BASICs of the era, and supported most of the elementary statements like . In contrast to most dialects, Vilnius did not allow more than one statement per line.

===Numeric variables, operators and functions===
As with most dialects, variable names had to start with a letter and could be followed by more letters or digits. Variable names could be any length, but only the first two characters were stored or matched, meaning that typing followed would result in a single variable in memory known as PR with the value 5.

Vilnius BASIC had four basic data types, strings, single and double-precision floating point numbers, and integers. Unless otherwise denoted, variables were assumed to be double-precision, stored in eight bytes and providing about 17 digits of precision. For comparison, most MS dialects used a 5-byte format for floating point. If was suffixed to the variable name, the value was stored in single-precision using four bytes with about 7 digits of precision. specified an integer, using a single 16-bit word to store values between -32768 and +32767. If a value with more precision was assigned to a variable with less, any excess was simply discarded; will result in A% having the value 1.

Numeric constants in the source code could also be specified as a particular type using the same indicators; would store the constant as an integer, or stores a single-precision value 0.05, and or stores the same value in the default double-precision format. Vilnius also had the additional ability to allow numeric constants to be typed in as strings of binary, octal or hexadecimal characters, by prefixing the string with and a single letter indicating the type, B, O, H. For instance, would convert the hexadecimal string H9A8B to the equivalent decimal value 39563 and store that in A.

Operators for numerical values included adding for integer division and for the remainder. Thus returns 2, while returns 1. Numeric functions include the standard . It also included the operator, which is similar to but always truncates toward zero so that returns -1 instead of -2 like INT.

In addition to PEEK and POKE, which returned 16-bit values, the system also offered , which were similar but applied a bit mask to the values to allow individual bits to be set or cleared. cleared the screen. System functions include which returned the amount of free memory, and which moved to the given column. worked in a similar fashion to TAB, but moved the cursor to the given X,Y location.

===Strings===
Suffixing a variable with indicated it was a string. String functions include the common . The function makes copies of a given pattern string so that will produce a string of 17 X&#x27;s. Only one manipulation function is included, , which works as in MS, but can also be used to replace characters in an existing string, will replace the first letter of A$ with Y. returns the current key pressed on the keyboard, if any. was used for string concatenation, as in most dialects.

The functions returned a string encoding the value passed in. For instance produces FF, while produces 0000000011111111.

===Graphics additions===
The Electronica systems included computer graphics support, and Vilnius BASIC included a number of statements to work with graphics. One interesting feature of this system was that X,Y coordinates were written in parens. The system remembered the last specified point, and new locations could be indicated with the , for instance, if the last draw command was at (100,100), one could turn the pixel at (105,105) to color 3 with . There were five color values, 0 through 3.

In addition to , one could draw lines from-to using a pair of coordinates separated by a minus sign, similar to the LIST command, for instance . In its simplest form, took an X,Y pair for the center, a radius, and a color, . It could also plot arcs from given start and end angles in radians, , and could &quot;compress&quot; the vertical axis to produce an ellipse, . performed a flood fill starting at (100,100), filling with color 3 and moving outward until it saw color 1.

Finally, there was the multi-purpose command. This took a string which encoded a series of drawing steps that could produce a complex shape in a single line of code. The four cardinal directions were indicated with U, D, L and R (up, down, left, right). The 45-degree angles were, moving clockwise, E (up-right), F, G and H (up-left). For instance, would produce a square with sides 20 pixels long starting at the last drawn position. In addition to directions, the M command could be used to specify explicit coordinates, like &quot;M100,120&quot;, which did not require the parens. C changes the color, B moves without drawing a line, and N resets the coordinates to what they were before the DRAW command.

There is a single graphics function, , which returns the number of the color of that location on the screen.

==Example program==

 1 CLS 
 2 FOR X%=30% TO 1% STEP -2% 
 3 ? AT(X%,1%);&quot;*&quot; 
 4 ? AT(X%,20%);&quot;*&quot; 
 5 NEXT X% 

This program clears the screen, creates a loop based on integer values, and then uses the command to move the cursor alternately between Y values 1 and 20, printing (using the short form for PRINT, ?) an asterix at both locations. The result is a series of 30 asterixes in two horizontal lines.

<text>Blackbaud, Inc. is a cloud computing provider that supports nonprofits, foundations, corporations, education institutions, healthcare organizations, religious organizations, and individual change agents. Its products focus on fundraising, website management, CRM, analytics, financial management, ticketing, and education administration.

Blackbaud&#x27;s flagship product is a fundraising SQL database software, Raiser&#x27;s Edge. Revenue from the sale of Raiser&#x27;s Edge and related services accounted for thirty percent of Blackbaud&#x27;s total revenue in 2012. Other products and services include Blackbaud Enterprise CRM, Altru, Financial Edge, Education Edge, Blackbaud NetCommunity, , Luminate Online, Luminate CRM, Friends Asking Friends. In addition, Blackbaud offers consultancy services to nonprofit organizations.

Blackbaud was founded in 1981 by Anthony Bakker. The company is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Blackbaud went to a remote-first approach for employees in 2021, closing all of its regional offices while keeping its Charleston headquarters.

Mike Gianoni is Blackbaud&#x27;s CEO.

==History==
Blackbaud&#x27;s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City. By 1982, Bakker&#x27;s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker, and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems. Bakker&#x27;s new company was headquartered in New York City. Blackbaud&#x27;s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools. The company&#x27;s flagship product, The Raiser&#x27;s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.

The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, with the help of a $750,000 business loan. Of the company&#x27;s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud&#x27;s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.

In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95. This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996. During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud&#x27;s &quot;chief challenger&quot;, Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana. Blackbaud&#x27;s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.

Blackbaud began using value-added resellers in 1998, which further expanded the company&#x27;s customer base. In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud. Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.

Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO. Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft&#x27;s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.

Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates in 2006. The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007. Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions, while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits. Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired , an online donor management tool.

Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008. In 2012, the company acquired Convio.

In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year. Anthony Boor became Blackbaud&#x27;s interim CEO in August 2013. Boor joined Blackbaud as the company&#x27;s chief financial officer in 2011. He was credited with leading Blackbaud&#x27;s acquisition of Convio.

Mike Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud in November 2013.

Blackbaud acquired MicroEdge in 2014 for $160 million. MicroEdge was a software provider to foundations, with about 2,000 customers.

In October 2017, Blackbaud completed a £95m, about $127.4 million, purchase of JustGiving.

In April 2018, Blackbaud acquired Reeher, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based predictive modeling platform for colleges and universities, for $40 million.

In January 2019, Blackbaud acquired YourCause, a software as a service (SaaS) provider focused on increasing corporate giving and volunteering for nonprofits and causes.

=== Cyber attack ===
In May 2020, Blackbaud fell victim to a cyber attack. Customer data was stolen, and Blackbaud paid the criminals a ransom in exchange for &quot;credible confirmation&quot; that the stolen data was deleted. Over 100 customers were affected, including at least twenty universities and charities based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands and Canada. Blackbaud externally disclosed the incident in July 2020, weeks after the company learned about the attack. Blackbaud received criticism for paying the hackers&#x27; ransom and its delay in disclosing the attack, as large data breaches must be reported to data authorities within 72 hours of learning about an incident under European General Data Protection Regulations. In a September 29, 2020 Form 8-K filing, Blackbaud CFO Tony Boor admitted, contrary to earlier claims, that customer &quot;bank account information, social security numbers, usernames and/or passwords&quot; were compromised.

In their quarterly filing to the SEC in August 2020, the company failed to disclose that donor bank account information and Social Security numbers had been accessed by the attacker. In March 2023, the SEC fined Blackbaud $3 million for this omission.

In October 2023, Blackbaud settled claims arising from the 2020 ransomware attack with 49 US states (excluding California) and the District of Columbia for $49.5M. The agreement also mandates enhanced breach notification processes, extra cybersecurity training, improved encryption, and external compliance evaluations.

In February 2024, the FTC announced a settlement with Blackbaud to improve its data handling, including establishing a data retention policy and deleting unneeded personal information, and to update its data protection practices.

Blackbaud faces class actions from clients in South Carolina and Massachusetts.

==Products==
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with Customer Relationship Management (CRM), marketing campaigns, fundraising, finance and accounting, and analytics. The company has three CRM offerings: The Raiser&#x27;s Edge NXT, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM. Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company&#x27;s lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks. Luminate is Blackbaud&#x27;s offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com. Financial Edge NXT is Blackbaud&#x27;s cloud based fund accounting system designed to integrate seamlessly with The Raiser&#x27;s Edge NXT fundraising CRM, manage financial reporting/budgeting, monitor and track grant/program success, and support fundraising efforts. In 2022, Blackbaud added Prospect Insights with Raiser&#x27;s Edge NXT for better fundraising tools in targeting specific donors.

==Philanthropy==
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service. The company&#x27;s Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice. In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters. Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs. The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.

<doc id="1172250" wikidata="Q1924477" url="?curid=1172250" title="Dalston Kingsland railway station">
<text>Dalston Kingsland is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground, located on the western side of Kingsland High Street in the Dalston area of the London Borough of Hackney. Situated in Travelcard Zone 2, the station straddles the boundary with the London Borough of Islington, with part of the platforms falling within Islington. The station is located opposite Ridley Road Market. Ticket barriers are in operation.

&quot;Kingsland railway station&quot; was opened on the site in 1850. It was closed and replaced by Dalston Junction station, approximately walk away, in 1865. The current station was opened by British Rail in 1983. There is now an official out-of-station interchange with Dalston Junction, which is served by the Windrush line of the London Overground.

==History==
A station was first opened on the site on 9 November 1850 by the North London Railway. It closed on 1 November 1865 when an extension was built to Broad Street in the City of London and a triangular junction was installed which joined the existing tracks to the east and west of the station. A new Dalston Junction station was opened at the southern tip of the junction and it replaced Kingsland station. The station was rebuilt and reopened on 16 May 1983 as part of the Crosstown Linkline service. The station replaced Dalston Junction when it closed in 1986, along with the rest of the line to Broad Street.

==Present day==
Dalston Junction reopened on 27 April 2010 on the London Overground East London line extension, with interchange permitted between it and Dalston Kingsland. The western curve of the junction was relaid for the East London line going to Highbury &amp; Islington station; the site of the eastern curve is covered by the car park of Kingsland shopping centre.

As part of TfL&#x27;s Overground improvement programme, plans have been approved to redevelop the station. Aside from increasing the number of entry and exit gates, the changes are largely cosmetic and do not make any provision for step-free access.

Plans have been approved to redevelop the &quot;Peacocks&quot; building immediately adjacent to the station into a 15-storey tower block.

==Services==
As part of the programme to introduce four-car trains on the London Overground network, the North London line between and closed in February 2010, reopening on 1 June 2010. The closure was to enable the installation of a new signalling system and the extension of 30 platforms. Engineering work continued until May 2011, during which reduced services operated and Sunday services were suspended.

Typical off-peak frequency at the station is four trains per hour westbound to via , and ; four trains per hour westbound to Clapham Junction; and eight trains per hour eastbound to . However, service intervals vary from about seven minutes during peak times to 30 minutes on Sundays

At Dalston Kingsland station the North London line (NLL) was powered by both 25 kV overhead AC and 750 V third-rail DC systems and was the change-over point between current collection by pantographs and by shoes for passenger trains that are dual-system Class 378 electric multiple units (EMUs). For reliability, time-saving, and as part of the NLL upgrade, the third rail has now been removed and overhead cables power the North London line between Stratford and Acton Central.

In August 2002 a potentially serious railway accident was avoided near Dalston Kingsland when a passenger train was inadvertently diverted on to the goods line during emergency signalling. When the passenger train was reversing to its correct path a following goods train almost ran into it.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 67, 76, 149, 243 and 488 serve the station.

<doc id="1172256" wikidata="Q1376060" url="?curid=1172256" title="Snow Country">
<text>is a novel by the Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata. The novel is considered a classic work of Japanese literature and was among the three novels the Nobel Committee cited in 1968, when Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Writing process ==
Gwenn Boardman Petersen uses &quot;Snow Country&quot; as an example of how Kawabata often composed his works. While writing that Japanese novelists often publish &quot;their works in serial form and under various titles&quot; she observes Kawabata is &quot;further noted for his habit of rewriting, adding segments, and making changes in titles and content alike.&quot; The first segment, titled appeared in January 1935. Kawabata later wrote that he could not finish his manuscript by the submission deadline of this literary journal, and decided to keep writing and submit a second version of this segment, titled to the general-interest magazine several days later.

Kawabata continued to write about the characters, and five more segments were published over the next years: and appeared in the journal in the November and December 1935 issues; appeared in August 1936; in October 1936; and was published in May 1937. He combined these segments into a &quot;complete&quot; &quot;Snow Country&quot;, making numerous changes to the texts as they appeared in the journals, which was published in June 1937.

Kawabata restarted work on the novel after a three-year break, again adding new chapters and again publishing in two separate journals, in 1940 and 1941. He re-wrote the last two sections, merging them into a single piece, published in a journal in 1946. Another additional piece arrived in 1947. Finally, in 1948, the novel reached its final form, an integration of nine separately published works.

Kawabata himself visited the Yuzawa and worked on the novel there. The room in the hotel where he was staying is preserved as a museum.

Kawabata again returned to &quot;Snow Country&quot; near the end of his life. A few months before his death in 1972, he wrote an abbreviated version of the work, which he titled &quot;Gleanings from Snow Country&quot;, that shortened the novel to a few spare pages, a length that placed it among his Palm-of-the-Hand Stories, a form to which Kawabata devoted particular attention for more than 50 years. An English translation of &quot;Gleanings from Snow Country&quot; was published in 1988 by J. Martin Holman, in the collection &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot;.

== Plot ==
&quot;Snow Country&quot; is a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha that takes place in the remote hot spring (&quot;onsen&quot;) town of Yuzawa. (Kawabata did not mention the name of the town in his novel.)

The novel opens with the protagonist of the novel, Shimamura, riding a train to a remote onsen town. Shimamura is a rich, married man, who inherited his wealth, and a self-professed ballet expert (although he has never seen one in person). During the train ride, he observes a young woman (who is later revealed as Yoko) caring for a sickly man (named Yukio). He observes the woman through a reflection in the train window, and is particularly enthralled by her eyes, as well as the sound of her voice.

Shimamura&#x27;s purpose for going to the onsen is meeting a young woman, Komako, with whom he had a brief encounter during his previous stay. Although she wasn&#x27;t employed as a geisha during his first stay, her situation is changed during his second visit. Shimamura is attracted to the young geisha, although his affection proves to be inconsistent and uncertain over time. However, Komako falls in love with Shimamura, which goes against the geisha tradition of meeting the customers&#x27; demands without any emotional attachment. Throughout their conversations, a number of things about Komako&#x27;s life is revealed: her becoming a geisha to pay for Yukio&#x27;s hospital bills, their rumored engagement, Komako and Yukio&#x27;s strained relationship, how she came to live with Yukio and his mother, and her life as a full-time geisha.

The climax of the novel happens during one of Komako&#x27;s visits to Shimamura&#x27;s room at the onsen inn. During their conversation, Shimamura calls her a &quot;good woman&quot;, instead of a &quot;good girl&quot;. This change of wording used to describe Komako reveals that the two of them could never be together, while Komako&#x27;s hopes of a better and happier life with Shimamura remain just a delusion.

At the very end of the novel, a fire occurs in the town warehouse, which was at the time being used as a cinema. Shimamura and Komako come to observe the fire, and see Yoko falling lifelessly from the warehouse balcony. Komako carries Yoko&#x27;s body away from the burning warehouse, while Shimamura slinks back, observing the night sky.

==Major themes==
===The modern and traditional===
Snow Country was written during a period of Japanese militarism, and a number of modern inventions can be seen in the novel, which include a train, a snowplow, and an electric avalanche warning system. Kawabata saw no conflict between the modern and the traditional, but saw modern inventions as part of the traditional Japan. This can be seen in the train scene, at the very beginning of the novel, during which the protagonist observes the beautiful eyes of the female passenger. The electric light of the train thus facilitates traditional aesthetic expression. Various modern inventions are treated as a normal part of life in the rustic onsen town.

===Beauty===
This novel, like others Kawabata wrote, vividly depicts the psychic cost of aesthetic appreciation, as well as its effect on minds susceptible to beauty. The protagonist of the novel is often taken out of the real world and into the dream world of his own mind after witnessing beauty. Furthermore, this beauty makes him oblivious to the world around him (e.g., after observing Yoko&#x27;s eyes in the train or seeing the Milky Way during the fire at the end of the novel). This beauty often leads to Shimamura acting cold or cruel, as when he calls Komako a &quot;good woman&quot; after observing her in the moonlight.

The depictions of beauty in the novel also include an element of sadness: loneliness in the beauty of nature, sadness in Yoko&#x27;s beautiful voice, wasted beauty of Komako, as well as the wasted effort in an act of love.

== Reception ==
Edward Seidensticker, noted scholar of Japanese literature whose English translation of the novel was published in 1956, described the work as &quot;perhaps Kawabata&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot; According to him, the novel reminds one of haiku, both for its many delicate contrapuntal touches and its use of brief scenes to tell a larger story. 

&quot;Snow Country&quot; received favorable reviews both at time of its publishing, and over the following years. The Times stated: &quot;He has fashioned an idyll out of unpromising material,&quot; while Eileen Fraser of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; said of &quot;Mr. Kawabata&#x27;s beautifully economical novel,&quot; &quot;This is a finely written book, excellently translated.&quot; Jason Cowley has called &quot;Snow Country&quot; &quot;...perhaps his finest work.&quot;

<text>Lucinda Margaret Grealy (June 3, 1963 – December 18, 2002) was an Irish-American poet and memoirist who wrote &quot;Autobiography of a Face&quot; in 1994. This critically acclaimed book describes her childhood and early adolescent experience with cancer of the jaw, which left her with some facial disfigurement. In a 1994 interview with Charlie Rose conducted right before she rose to the height of her fame, Grealy stated that she considered her book to be primarily about the issue of &quot;identity.&quot;

==Life==
Grealy was born in Dublin, Ireland, and her family moved to the United States in April 1967, settling in Spring Valley, New York. She was diagnosed at age 9 with a rare form of cancer called Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma. Treatment for this often fatal cancer (Grealy reports an estimated 5% survival rate using therapies available at the time of her diagnosis) led to the removal of her jawbone, and over the following years she had many facial reconstructive surgeries. In her memoir, &quot;Autobiography of a Face&quot;, Grealy describes her life from the time of her diagnosis and how she weathered the cruelty of schoolmates and others, suffering taunts and stares from strangers.

At 18, Grealy entered Sarah Lawrence College where she made her first real friends and nurtured her love of poetry. She graduated in 1985 and went on to study at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. In Iowa she lived with fellow writer Ann Patchett. Their friendship is the subject of Patchett&#x27;s 2004 memoir &quot;Truth &amp; Beauty: A Friendship&quot;.

In 1991, she was awarded a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, where she completed her memoir. In 1995, the book won Grealy a Whiting Award, given to young writers of exceptional talent.

She published a collection of essays in 2000, &quot;As Seen on TV: Provocations&quot;. She taught writing at Bennington College and New School University.

Following her final reconstructive surgery, Grealy became dependent upon her prescribed painkiller, OxyContin, as she had earlier with codeine. She died of a heroin overdose on December 18, 2002, in New York City, at age 39.

Her sister, Suellen Grealy, was opposed to Ann Patchett&#x27;s timing in publishing &quot;Truth and Beauty&quot;. While she claims that Patchett and the book&#x27;s publisher HarperCollins stole the Grealy family&#x27;s right to grieve privately, she acknowledges that &quot;Ann was a far better &#x27;sister&#x27; to Lucy than I could ever have been&quot;.

==Awards==
* 1995 Whiting Award
Lucy Grealy won several prizes for her poetry, among them the Sonora Review Prize, the London TLS poetry prize and two Academy of American Poets awards.

==Works==
* &quot;Everyday Alibis&quot;, a chapbook of poems
** (Renamed British edition of &quot;Autobiography of a Face&quot;)

<doc id="1172271" wikidata="Q700133" url="?curid=1172271" title="Südwestrundfunk">
<text>(; ), shortened to SWR (), is a regional public broadcasting corporation serving the southwest of Germany, specifically the federal states of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. The corporation has main offices in three cities: Stuttgart, Baden-Baden and Mainz, with the director&#x27;s office being in Stuttgart. It is a part of the ARD consortium.

It broadcasts on two television channels and six radio channels, with its main television and radio office in Baden-Baden and regional offices in Stuttgart and Mainz. It is the second largest broadcasting organization in Germany behind WDR. SWR, with a coverage of 55,600 km2 (21,500 sq. mi.), and an audience reach estimated to be 14.7 million. SWR employs 3,700 people in its various offices and facilities.

==History==
SWR was established on 1 January 1998 through the merger of &quot;Süddeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (SDR, Southern German Broadcasting), formerly headquartered in Stuttgart, and &quot;Südwestfunk&quot; (SWF, South West Radio), formerly headquartered in Baden-Baden. The new corporation began broadcasting on 1 September 1998. Its predecessor organizations, SDR and SWF, were formally dissolved at 24:00 on 30 September 1998, SWR legally succeeding them with effect from 0:00 on 1 October 1998.

The existence of two public broadcasting corporations in southwest Germany was a legacy of the Allied occupation of Germany after the Second World War. The French Military Government established SWF as the sole public broadcaster in their occupation zone. This area was later divided into the states of South Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Rhineland-Palatinate. The American Military Government established SDR in Württemberg-Baden. When Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Württemberg-Baden merged to form Baden-Württemberg in 1952, the corporations were not merged, although SDR and SWF operated several joint services.

The two corporations had intended to merge in 1990, but the merger was pushed back by the reunification process.

Several channel mergers and changes took effect from 1 September 1998:
* SWF 1 and SDR 1 became SWR1 Baden-Württemberg and SWR1 Rheinland-Pfalz: regional programmes for their respective states (Länder)
* S 2 Kultur became SWR2
* SWF3 and SDR 3 became the pop station SWR3
* S 4 Baden-Württemberg became SWR4 Baden-Württemberg
* SWF 4 Rheinland-Pfalz became SWR4 Rheinland-Pfalz
* DASDING was unchanged and continued broadcasting
* The television channel Südwest 3 became Südwest BW and Südwest RP, and today transmits as SWR Fernsehen

A radio news channel, SWR cont.ra, was added in July 2002. This was relaunched with a new programme format on 9 January 2012 as SWRinfo. It was relaunched again as SWR Aktuell on 6 February 2017.

== Finances ==

Licensing fees required for radio and TV sets are €17.50 per month, as of 1 April 2015. These fees are not collected directly by the SWR but by the ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice that is a common organisation of ARD, its members, ZDF and Deutschlandradio.

In 2016, the SWR received over from these fees, out of nearly collected in total that year.

<doc id="1172273" wikidata="Q4070853" url="?curid=1172273" title="Architecture of Ireland">
<text>The architecture of [[Ireland]] is one of the most visible features in the Irish countryside – with remains from all eras since the Stone Age abounding. Ireland is famous for its ruined and intact Norman and Anglo-Irish castles, small whitewashed thatched cottages and Georgian urban buildings. What are unaccountably somewhat less famous are the still complete Palladian and Rococo country houses which can be favourably compared to anything similar in northern Europe, and the country&#x27;s many Gothic and neo-Gothic cathedrals and buildings.

Despite the oft-times significant British and wider European influence, the fashion and trends of architecture have been adapted to suit the peculiarities of the particular location. Variations of stone (particularly limestone, granite and sandstone), lime mortar, wood, sod, cob and straw are prevalent materials in traditional Irish architecture. 

==Pre-Christian Ireland==

Grange stone circle is the largest such megalithic construction in Ireland. The earliest date from the Neolithic or late Stone Age. Megalithic tombs are relatively common, with court graves or court tombs being the oldest, some dating back to around 3500 BC. Such tombs consisted of a long chamber, with a large open area (or court) at the entrance. This &quot;court&quot; was generally marked out with standing stones, with the rest of the structure also built in stone.

Passage tombs consisted of a central burial chamber, with a long passageway to the entrance. Again, standing stones were often used for the walls, with slabs of stone over the roof. Newgrange in particular is more interesting in that the inner chamber uses corbelling to span the roof. The chamber and passageway were usually contained in an earthen mound, with the chamber at the centre (Newgrange is again notable in having exterior stonework on the mound). Other notable passage graves are Knowth and Dowth, also in the Boyne Valley near Drogheda.

From some time beginning around the Iron Age, Ireland has thousands of ring forts, or &quot;raths&quot;. These consist of an earthen embankment around a central enclosure, sometimes sited on a raised mound. In some cases, a souterrain (tunnel) forms part of the structure. These were built also as hill forts depending on the local terrain, or indeed promontory forts. Dún Aengus on the Aran Islands one of the best examples of these forts, which may have been occupied at various times, even in the mediaeval era.

==Early Christian Ireland==

One feature not usually found outside Ireland is the round tower, such as that at Clonmacnoise in County Offaly or the one on Devenish Island near Enniskillen in County Fermanagh. These were usually built within the monasteries that sprang up all over the island, as the country became the &quot;land of saints and scholars&quot;. They were possibly defensive in nature, serving as lookout posts and a place of refuge during an attack (the door to such structures was usually quite high off the ground). Viking raids on Ireland&#x27;s shores and monasteries were relatively common. St. Cronan&#x27;s Church in Tuamgraney, County Clare, a pre-Romanesque church which dates from the 10th century, is the oldest church in continuous use in both Ireland and Great Britain. 

Eventually, some Vikings settled permanently in Ireland, and the main cities were established by the Vikings. Although no buildings from that era are now intact, some street arrangements have their origins in the original Viking layouts. Remains of Viking dwellings have been discovered in many locations, but notably at Wood Quay in Dublin, King John&#x27;s Castle in Limerick and near Waterford (where what is thought to be the original settlement at Waterford has been uncovered in 2004 during construction of the city&#x27;s ring road).

==Medieval Ireland==

After early stone remains, the next most visible features in the Irish countryside are the innumerable castle remains, tower houses and intact castles. Apart from well-known and restored castles such as Bunratty Castle, many unknown remains (particularly of tower houses) exist next to newer farmhouses, or again, simply in fields. Carrickfergus Castle, built by John de Courcy in 1177, as his headquarters after his invasion of Ulster, is the most perfectly preserved Norman castle on the island. The castle at Cahir is also a particularly well-preserved example.

Many fine churches in Ireland were also built during this time, such as St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral in Kilkenny and St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Limerick. Most common was the Romanesque style, as seen at Cormac&#x27;s Chapel on the Rock of Cashel, and at Clonfert Cathedral in Galway. It was the Normans who brought the Gothic style to Ireland, with such buildings as Christ Church and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Dublin.

Some of Ireland&#x27;s main cities were built up and fortified before and during the mediaeval period. Limerick remained a walled city until the 18th century, while Derry&#x27;s medieval walls still stand today. Such features as King John&#x27;s Castle were built as major fortifications.

Cork and Galway flourished as sea ports, with the establishment of extensive quays in those cities, as well as Limerick and Dublin. Many ancillary buildings were built, such as granaries, storehouses, and early administrative buildings such as custom houses, tholsels and market houses. Some were replaced, rebuilt or removed – many remaining port facilities date from more recent centuries.

==The Restoration and after==
In the decades after the Stuart Restoration, English Baroque architectural styles, including Queen Anne style architecture, were popular in Ireland. This was epitomised by the buildings designed by Sir William Robinson between the 1670s and early 1700s, most notably the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and Marsh&#x27;s Library. Also notable was Thomas Burgh (1670–1730), the architect of Trinity College Library (1712), Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital (1719) and the Royal Barracks (1702). 

In the early 18th century classical Palladian architecture swept through Ireland, the driving force behind this new fashion was the Irish architect Edward Lovett Pearce. Pearce, born in County Meath in 1699, had studied architecture in Italy, before returning in 1725 to Ireland to oversee, and later, almost, co-design Ireland&#x27;s first Palladian mansion Castletown House.

Castletown house was a milestone in Irish architecture, designed originally by the Italian Alessandro Galilei, circa 1717, in the manner of an Italian town palazzo, for Ireland&#x27;s most influential man, the politician Speaker William Conolly, it set a new standard and fashion in Irish architecture. The original architect had returned to Italy before the first stone was laid, subsequently the Irish Pearce was responsible not only for the construction, but modification and improvement to the original plan. From the mid-1720s onwards almost every sizeable building, in Ireland, was cast in the Palladian mould.
Through Castletown and his later work, including the Irish Houses of Parliament, Pearce had firmly established many of the Italian architectural concepts in Ireland. Following Pearce&#x27;s death in 1733, his protégé Richard Cassels (also known as Richard Castle) was to design many of Ireland&#x27;s finest buildings in a similar, if not more robust, form of Palladian. Many fine country houses were built in the Palladian style around the country by the rich Ascendancy in Ireland. Some, such as Leinster House, designed by Sir William Chamber and Russborough House (&quot;illustrated above&quot;), were among the finest examples of Palladian architecture. Palladianism in Ireland often differed from that elsewhere in Europe because of the ornate rococo interiors, often with stucco by Robert West and the Lafranchini brothers. Although many of these mansions, such as Pearce and Cassels&#x27; joint design Summerhill House, were destroyed in the numerous Irish rebellions, many examples of this unique marrying of the rococo and Palladian still remain today as unique examples of Irish Palladianism.

Elsewhere in Dublin, George Semple built St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital (1747) and Thomas Cooley the Royal Exchange (1769; now City Hall).

==Georgian Ireland==

In the later half of the 18th century, one of the most important architects in the country was the London-born James Gandon. Gandon came to Ireland in 1781 at the invitation of Lord Carlow and John Beresford, the Irish commissioner of revenue. Gandon&#x27;s buildings in Dublin include the Custom House, the Four Courts, the King&#x27;s Inns and the eastern extension to the Irish parliament building in College Green. By this time the Palladian style had evolved further, and the strict rules of mathematical ratio and axis dictated by Palladio had been all but abandoned. This subsequent evolution is generally referred to as Georgian architecture. It is in this style that large parts of Dublin were rebuilt, causing the city to be referred to as Georgian Dublin.
Francis Johnston was the third great Irish architect of this period. Johnston served as Architect to the Board of Works for a time and was thus responsible for much of the planning of Georgian Dublin. He also left a number of very fine buildings, including St. George&#x27;s Church, Hardwicke Place and the Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix Park. This latter now serves as Áras an Uachtaráin, the official residence of the President of Ireland, and is one possible model for the White House in Washington. Leinster House also claims this distinction, and the Neoclassical Castle Coole in County Fermanagh designed by James Wyatt bears an even greater similarity.
In addition to these large-scale buildings, the defining characteristic of Georgian city planning was terraces, squares of elegant family homes even with parks, one of them being St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, one of Dublin&#x27;s largest parks. In Ireland, many of these became tenements during the course of the 19th century and a significant proportion were demolished as part of various 20th-century slum clearance programmes. However, many squares and terraces survive in both Dublin and Limerick. Of particular interest are Pery Square in the latter city and Merrion Square, one of Dublin&#x27;s most iconic square, in the former. Some smaller towns in Ireland also have Georgian architecture of interest, such as the fine Georgian squares and terraces of Mountmellick, County Laois, and Birr, County Offaly, which is a designated Irish Heritage Town.

Near the end of George III&#x27;s reign, one of Ireland&#x27;s most famous Georgian buildings was completed. The GPO was built in 1814 and located on Dublin&#x27;s main street, O&#x27;Connell Street. Designed by Francis Johnston, the building&#x27;s most striking feature is its hexastyle Ionic portico. Above the building are three statues representing Fidelity, Hibernia and Mercury. The interior is made up largely of a postal hall with a high ceiling. The building has been largely rebuilt since its original construction, mainly due to severe damage incurred in the Easter Rising in 1916.

To enhance the new buildings and cope with larger traffic volumes, the Wide Streets Commission was established in 1757. It bought houses by compulsory purchase to widen streets or to create new ones.

==Victorian period==

During the 19th century, because all of Ireland was a constituent part of the United Kingdom, British architecture continued to influence building styles in Ireland. Many prominent Irish buildings were designed and built in Ireland during this period (1837–1901), including Findlater&#x27;s Church on Parnell Square, the Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Olympia Theatre, the Central Markets in Cork, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the Natural History Museum, and the National Gallery of Ireland. Many of these new buildings were located in the Southside of Dublin in places like Kildare Street and Baggot Street and in the centre of Cork. An important contributor was the notable English architect, Decimus Burton. He remodelled much of Cobh, commissioned by the 5th Viscount Midleton, in the 1840s. He was the designer of Martinstown House in County Kildare. Prior to that he spent almost two decades renovating the vast neglected public areas of Phoenix Park in Dublin and incidentally designing Dublin Zoo.

However, few buildings were built outside the major cities other than a few railway stations in the provincial towns.

During the Victorian period, many new statues were erected in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, Belfast and Cork. These included several rather elegant statues of figures such as Queen Victoria, Daniel O&#x27;Connell and Henry Grattan.
One of Ireland&#x27;s finest Victorian buildings is the cathedral dedicated to St Mary at Killarney; it is built in a Neo-Gothic style known as &#x27;Lancet-arched Gothic&#x27;, so called because the cathedral has many long, slender lancet-shaped windows with acutely pointed arches. The architect was August Pugin, one of the greatest of Victorian architects. The cathedral—begun in 1842, funded by public subscription, and interrupted by the horrors of famine—was finally dedicated in 1855. The design is typical of Irish Gothic; it blends Corinthian and Doric orders and is decorated with Sicilian marble and Caen stone. The cathedral is crowned by a spire of . Pugin&#x27;s work was eminently suited to Ireland. A convert to Roman Catholicism, he believed Gothic architecture to be the only style suitable for religious worship and attacked the earlier Neoclassical architecture as pagan and almost blasphemous. This philosophy embraced by the church in Ireland at the time helped to popularise the Gothic style in Victorian Ireland.

==20th century – present==

In the 20th century, Irish architecture followed the international trend towards modern, sleek and often radical building styles, particularly after Partition and the independence of most of Ireland as the Irish Free State in the early 1920s. Two major exceptions to this were the Royal College of Science for Ireland (now Government Buildings), on Upper Merrion Street in central Dublin, and Parliament Buildings at Stormont in East Belfast, both built in more traditional architectural styles. New building materials and old were utilised in new ways to maximise style, space, light and energy efficiency. 1928 saw the construction of Ireland&#x27;s first all concrete Art Deco church in Turner&#x27;s Cross, Cork. The building was designed by Chicago architect Barry Byrne and met with a cool reception among those more accustomed to traditional designs.

In January 1940, the Art Deco Dublin airport opened, designed by Desmond FitzGerald and the Office of Public Works.

In 1953, one of Ireland&#x27;s most radical buildings, Bus Éireann&#x27;s main Dublin terminal building, better known as Busáras was completed. It was built despite considerable controversy at the time centred on its appearance and high cost(over £1m). Michael Scott, its designer, is now considered one of the most important architects of the twentieth century in Ireland – however the original structure has become dilapidated and dated.

One of the main proponents of modernist and Brutalist architecture in Ireland was Sam Stephenson. Stephenson designed the Civic Offices (1979) and the Central Bank of Ireland (1980), both of which generated considerable controversy at the time of their construction. In the same period, Liam McCormick designed the modernist Met Éireann headquarters in Glasnevin, Dublin (1979).

In 1987, the government started to plan what is now known as the IFSC. The complex today houses over 14,000 office workers. One of the most symbolic structures of modern Irish architecture is the Spire of Dublin. Completed in January 2003, the structure was nominated in 2004 for the prestigious Stirling Prize.

From the 2010s and onwards, several new mid to high-rise buildings have been erected in Dublin, such as Capital Dock, The Exo Building and College Square.

==Vernacular architecture==
The thatched roof cottage and blackhouse have a tradition dating back 9,000 years. Now considered quaint, thatched cottages are often rented out for tourists on holidays. A characteristically exuberant vernacular expression is often found in shopfronts throughout Ireland. Patrick O&#x27;Donovan has observed that in the nineteenth century there was &quot;a brilliant explosion&quot; of domestic architecture borne of the opportunities that plate glass, Art Nouveau and classical and gothic themes all offered up at the time. &quot;In Ireland&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the villages were not the places where people lived, but where they came for supplies and, most regularly, to attend church. Yet the shops did almost everything that the Church could not do, and offered an alternative, perhaps, to the latter&#x27;s solemnity.&quot;

<text>François Marie Tanguy Prigent (; 11 October 1909 – 20 January 1970) was a French Socialist politician who became a resistance fighter during World War II (1939–45). He was Minister of Agriculture from September 1944 to October 1947 and was Minister of Veterans and War Victims from February 1956 to June 1957.

==Early years==

François Tanguy-Prigent was born to a farming family on 11 October 1909 in the small town of Saint-Jean-du-Doigt, in the Finistère department of Brittany. He worked on the land from the age of 12 to 26, when he was elected to the legislature.
He joined the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) in 1926.
He undertook his military service in Paris in 1930–31, and on return became an active SFIO militant. In 1933–34 he played a major role in creation of the Fédération paysanne du Finistère, an agricultural union affiliated with the CNP, of which he became a national director. 

In 1934 Tanguy-Prigent was elected councilor general for the canton of Lanmeur, but was not yet 25 so was unable to take his seat.
He was reelected in March 1935. That year he became municipal councilor and then mayor of Saint-Jean-du-Doigt. He would hold these positions until his death, except during the Vichy France period.

On 3 May 1936 Tanguy-Prigent was elected deputy to the National Assembly for the 1st district of Morlaix in the second round of voting.
He joined the Socialists in the chamber. For the next four years Tanguy-Prigent was particularly involved in agricultural issues. He attended agricultural conferences in Geneva (1937), Prague (1938) and Dresden (1939).
He was strongly opposed to the Munich Agreement, and in May 1940 volunteered to fight with the 31st regiment of dragoons. He was one of the 80 deputies who refused to vote to give full powers to Marshal Pétain on 10 July 1940.

==World War II Resistance==

Tanguy-Prigent returned to farming in Saint-Jean-du-Doigt. 
He was arrested by the Germans from 6–23 September 1940. Tanguy-Prigent opposed the policies of Vichy by all legal means. 
At the same time he joined the Resistance, notably in Libération Nord under the resistance name of &quot;Jacques Le Ru&quot;. 
He narrowly escaped arrest in the summer of 1943 and went into hiding with his wife. He also founded the Resistance Paysanne newspaper. For many months he helped put in place the structure of Armée secrète (the secret army) for the 19 departments in the northwest of France. In summer 1944 he personally fought with the French Forces of the Interior to liberate the Morlaix region. In August that year, he participated in the arrest of peasant populist and former Vichy official Henry Dorgères.

==Later career==

Tanguy-Prigent represented Finistère as a member of the first and second National Constituent Assemblies, and was a deputy for Finistère from 1946 to 1958.
He was named Minister of Agriculture by General Charles de Gaulle, holding office from September 1944 to October 1947. He was Minister of Supplies from November 1945 to January 1946. He dissolved the Vichy regime&#x27;s Peasant Corporation in September 1944, but the unity of agricultural organizations that it had established persisted. He replaced the Corporation with a national union of working farmers rather than landowners, the General Confederation of Agriculture (GCA).
In March 1946 the CGA became the Fédération nationale des syndicats d&#x27;exploitants agricoles (FNSEA). Many of the former Peasant Corporation leaders became leaders of the FNSEA.

Tanguy-Prigent was Minister of Veterans and War Victims from February 1956 to June 1957. He was again deputy for Finistère from 1962 to 1967.

Tanguy-Prigent died on 20 January 1970 in Morlaix.

<text>State aid in the European Union is the name given to a subsidy or any other aid provided by a government that distorts competition. Under European Union competition law, the term has a legal meaning, being any measure that demonstrates any of the characteristics in Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in that if it distorts competition or the free market, it is classified by the European Union as illegal state aid. Measures that fall within the definition of state aid are considered unlawful unless provided under an exemption or notified by the European Commission. In 2019, the EU member states provided state aid corresponding to 0.81% of the bloc&#x27;s GDP.

==EU policy on state aid ==
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Art. 107, para. 1) reads:

&quot;Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.&quot;

This sets out the characteristics of a &quot;state aid&quot; and states that the award of a state aid will be unlawful unless compatible with the common market, which is achieved either by applying a block exemption or notification.

Five cumulative criteria shall be present for a &quot;state aid&quot; to exist:

# &quot;the use of state resources&quot;
# &quot;the measure must confer an advantage to a certain undertaking&quot;
# &quot;the advantage must be selective&quot;
# &quot;the measure must distort competition&quot;
# &quot;affect trade between member states&quot;.

Almost all state aid is awarded under block exemptions. For example, 96% of state aid is awarded under the General Block Exemption Regulation. States can award state aid via notification of the European Commission DG Competition under guidelines such as the Regional Aid Guidelines (RAG), the Climate, Energy, and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG), the Risk Finance Guidelines (RFG), and the Research, Development, and Innovation Framework (RDI).

== History ==
State aid was formally introduced into European Union statute law by the Treaty of Rome, which classified state aid as any state intervention that distorted competition law. The definition was later updated by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in 2007. It stated that any aid given to a company by a state within the EU would generally be incompatible with the EU&#x27;s Common Market. Within the new law under the treaty, the first chapter defines what is not allowed to be done with state aid, and the second chapter defines actions that can be done within legal limits.
&quot;1. Save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.&quot;

The intent of this was that, in order to avoid favouring a certain company or commercial group, an EU member state should not provide support by financial aid, lesser taxation rates, or other means to a party that does normal commercial business. For example, it would be considered illegal state aid by the EU if a government took over an unprofitable company with the sole intent to keep it running at a loss. However, state aid can be approved by the European Commission in individual circumstances but the aid can be reclaimed by the EU if it breaches the treaty.

There are specific exemptions to the treaty&#x27;s provisions with regard to state aid. State aid can be given to parties involved in charity or &quot;to promote culture and heritage conservation&quot;. The treaty also stated that aid given in response to natural disasters would be lawful. An exemption was given to allow Germany to provide aid, provided the aid was used in relation to promoting development in former East German locations affected by the division of Germany after Germany&#x27;s loss in the Second World War.

=== Temporary Framework during the COVID-19 Outbreak ===
In order to allow member states to rapidly respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 20, 2020, the European Commission issued a temporary framework for state aid measures, allowing member states more flexibility in providing direct financial aid and loans beyond the existing possibilities of Article 107. The measures were originally set to expire on December 31, 2020. The measures specifically allowed for:

* Direct grants, advances, or tax advantages with certain ceilings
* Guarantees on loans 
* Subsidised interest rates
* Guarantees and loans that are channelled through banks
* Short-term export-credit insurance

The framework was extended for another year on January 28, 2021, and expanded to double the ceilings for direct aid, the conversion of loans into grants, and the suspension of the list of countries with &quot;marketable risk&quot; for short-term export credit. On November 18, 2021, the EU announced that it would extend the measures for another six months, also introducing investment incentives and solvency support measures. In May 2022, the EU announced that the framework would not be renewed beyond the expiry date of June 30, 2022, although it allowed restructuring of loans into direct grants until June 30, 2023. The EU estimates that a total of 3.2 trillion euros of state aid were granted via the temporary framework.

== Limitations of the EU State Aid ==
The EU jurisdiction is a rare case where specific binding legal provisions were introduced for controlling state aid. These provisions in principle require the commission to authorise all grants of aid, which has proven to be a difficult, if not impossible, task with 27 EU member states. This control may seem unnecessary, as most subsidies (tax breaks) are supposed to &quot;induce new firms to locate in the subsidizing state&quot;. The argument is that since countries are keen to compete for bringing firms into their territory by providing good infrastructure, education, health care, etc., state aid should not differ much (e.g., locational aid). Even though the argument cannot be dismissed &quot;prima facie&quot;, it is based on &quot; the assumption that the lengths of the political and the economic cycles are the same&quot;. This assumption is incorrect since political cycles are much shorter than economic cycles and even under rigorous fiscal disciplines policy-makers keep up the positive incentives to grant an &quot;excessive amount of state aid (in comparison to real advantages)&quot;. Introducing limitations and controlling state aid is necessary to hinder the issuance of excessive state aids, which is especially relevant in the case of the Union that lacks a strict balanced budget constraint and mainly operates with a single currency (the euro). According to Alberto Heimler and Frédéric Jenny, &quot;State aid provisions are a discipline for member states.&quot; However, the Commission may temporarily exempt aids that remedy serious economic disturbances provided the disturbance is narrowly and strictly defined. The European Court of Justice further disciplines the EU member states and enforces the limitation. Introduction of state aid provisions would be beneficial for all countries but governments tend to distance themselves from imposing disciplining devices unless there is an international treaty that does so. For countries that are not part of the EU, aid limitations arise from the World Trade Organization agreements which prohibit subsidies exclusively when they are directed to the distortion of international trade as strictly defined. These agreements also recognize what is known as the actionable subsidies that can be prohibited when the complaining country shows the adverse effect the subsidy has on its interests. In particular, the prohibition may occur when a serious injury is caused on:

* &quot;the importing country&#x27;s domestic industry&quot;
* &quot;rival exporters in a third country trying to compete with a subsidized exporter&quot;
* &quot;exporters trying to compete with subsidized domestic firms&quot;

However, due to the lack of specifications, definitions and in some cases clarifications, the WTO case is highly controversial and more of an exception than a rule. A solution to this would be a more thorough regime somewhat in line with that of the European Union. In that case, the prohibition of state subsidies would occur if the subsidies were anti-competitive and affected international trade.

==United Kingdom&#x27;s Subsidy Control regime==
The EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020 requires the UK to introduce an alternative state subsidy system.

This will be called &quot;Subsidy Control&quot;. The new regime will be based on commitments made in Chapter 3 of the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The UK Government has published guidance to assist public sector organisations comply with the regime and has confirmed it will consult on changes to the regime during 2021.

==Examples==

===Banking Crisis===
In 2008, the British government was granted permission from the European Commission to provide state aid to nationalise Lloyds TSB during the financial crisis of 2007–08. However, the Commission decreed that because Lloyds TSB&#x27;s financial requirements had come about from their takeover of HBOS, in order for the state aid to be legal, they would have to sell part of their business. Lloyds Bank did this by splitting off TSB Bank as a separate company initially owned by them and sold it to Banco de Sabadell in order to stay within the EU&#x27;s rules on state aid.

===Apple taxation case===
In 2016, following a 2-year investigation, the European Commission ruled that Ireland had given tax rulings to Apple Inc that acted as a form of illegal state aid under EU competition law. Apple has been using a customized variation of the &quot;double Irish&quot; tax avoidance system (used by many US multinationals in Ireland). The rulings from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, which enabled the customization, were deemed to be unfair state aid. The Commission stated that as a result, Apple would have to pay €13 billion in Irish taxes (2004–2014), plus interest penalties, to the Irish government. The Irish cabinet stated they would challenge the commission&#x27;s finding of state aid and would appeal against the ruling.

<text>The periodontium () is the specialized tissues that both surround and support the teeth, maintaining them in the maxillary and mandibular bones. Periodontics is the dental specialty that relates specifically to the care and maintenance of these tissues. It provides the support necessary to maintain teeth in function. It consists of four principal components, namely:
* Gingiva (the gums)
* Periodontal ligament (PDL) 
* Cementum
* Alveolar bone proper

Each of these components is distinct in location, architecture, and biochemical properties, which adapt during the life of the structure. For example, as teeth respond to forces or migrate medially, bone resorbs on the pressure side and is added on the tension side. Cementum similarly adapts to wear on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth by apical deposition. The periodontal ligament in itself is an area of high turnover that allows the tooth not only to be suspended in the alveolar bone but also to respond to the forces. Thus, although seemingly static and having functions of their own, all of these components function as a single unit.
The Wnt signaling antagonist Sfrp3/Frzb has been recently discovered as an early developmental marker of the periodontium.

==External forces and the periodontium==

The periodontium exists for the purpose of supporting teeth during their function and it depends on the stimulation it receives from the function for preservation of its structure. Therefore, a constant state of balance always exists between the periodontal structures and the external forces.

Alveolar bone undergoes constant physiologic remodeling in response to external forces, particularly occlusal forces. Bone is removed from areas where it is no longer needed and added to areas where it is needed. The socket wall reflects the responsiveness to the external forces. Osteoblasts and newly formed osteoid line the areas of tension, whereas lines of compression are lined by osteoclasts. The forces also influence the number, density, and alignment of trabeculae inside the bone. The bony trabeculae are aligned in the path of tensile and compressive stresses to provide maximum resistance to occlusal forces with a minimum of bone substance. When forces are increased, the bony trabeculae also increase in number and thickness and bone is added to the external surfaces.

The periodontal ligament depends on stimulation provided by function to preserve its structure. Within physiologic limits the PDL can accommodate increased function by increasing its width. Forces that exceed the adaptive capacity of the periodontium produce injury called &quot;trauma from occlusion&quot;. When occlusal forces are reduced the PDL atrophies, appearing thinned. This phenomenon is called &quot;disuse atrophy&quot;.

<doc id="1172299" wikidata="Q344384" url="?curid=1172299" title="Damon Dash">
<text>Damon Anthony Dash (born May 3, 1971) is an American entrepreneur and record executive. He co-founded Roc-A-Fella Records with Jay-Z and Kareem Burke in 1994, and co-founded the fashion retailer Rocawear with the former in 1999.

==Early life ==
Born in New York City, Dash swept the floors of a local barbershop and sold newspapers in order to buy sneakers and shirts as a teenager. Dash &quot;learned to hustle&quot;, in his own words, from the example of his mother, who died of an asthma attack when he was 15. The same year, Dash was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. &quot;Before I was diagnosed... I went about a month or two just going to the bathroom non-stop and losing weight&quot;, Dash recalled. &quot;Magic Johnson had just been diagnosed with AIDS, so that&#x27;s what I thought I had. I was scared to even go to the doctor. I thought I was going to die.&quot;

== Career ==

Dash served as Jay-Z&#x27;s manager and business partner at Roc-A-Fella Records, and in 1999, he organized a tour for Jay-Z which made $19 million. Their relationship soured as a result of two subsequent events. The first was when Roc-A-Fella Records was purchased by Def Jam Recordings (which had previously only owned half of the company) in 2004, after which Jay-Z agreed to take a job as Def Jam&#x27;s president. Then, in late 2005, Jay-Z bought Dash out of his stake in Rocawear.

In April 2014, it was announced that Dash is involved with Blind Debit, a fingerprint payment application being developed by Dez White.

Dash founded DD172, a media collective which encompasses: &quot;America Nu&quot;, a magazine; VNGRD79, a web design firm; BluRoc Records, a record label division. It also includes an art gallery.

==Personal life==

Dash met R&amp;B singer Aaliyah in New York City in the summer of 2000 through his accountant, and dated her until her death on August 25, 2001, in a plane crash in The Bahamas. Though they were not formally engaged, in interviews given after Aaliyah&#x27;s death, Dash stated that the couple had planned to marry.

In 2005, Dash married fashion designer Rachel Roy, whom he had dated prior to his relationship with Aaliyah. They met when she was working as an intern at Rocawear. Together they have two daughters, Ava Dash (born December 7, 1999) and Tallulah Dash (born May 14, 2008). Following their divorce in 2009, they had a bitter custody battle.

Dash has a son, Dame &quot;Boogie&quot; Dash (born November 28, 1991), with former girlfriend Linda Williams. Boogie stars in the reality television show &quot;Growing Up Hip Hop&quot;. He also has another son, Lucky, born in 2004 with Cindy Morales.

Dash and his fiancée Raquel Horn have a son, Dusko Dash, born on November 14, 2020. 

Dash is a first cousin of the actress Stacey Dash.

==Legal issues ==
In 2012, rapper Curren$y sued Dash for $1.5 million for releasing his music without permission. Dash&#x27;s attorney released a statement that Dash released the music on fair grounds.

In 2014, Dash was ordered to pay Linda Williams, the mother of his son Boogie, $50,000 for causing her to be prosecuted on harassment charges in 2009.

In April 2015, Dash&#x27;s ex-wife, Rachel Roy, accused him of domestic abuse and filed for a restraining order. Roy was awarded sole custody of their daughters. The court granted Roy and her daughters with a three-year restraining order against Dash. Days later, Dash filed a $2.5 million claim against Roy in asserted damage for allegedly mishandling their joint fashion business, Royale Etenia.

In 2018, Dash settled a suit he filed against director Lee Daniels requesting $5 million to recoup a $2 million investment with interest. Lee had received financial support from Dash early in his career, and reportedly failed to repay him despite his subsequent success.

In November 2019, Dash was arrested for failing to pay more than $400,000 in child support. Dash was in New York City for an unrelated Federal Court appearance when he was arrested for two warrants. The first warrant was issued in April 2015 in the Supreme Court in New York County case of Cindy Morales; he owed $62,553 since 2012. The second warrant was issued in March 2019 in the Bronx Family Court case of Rachel Roy. He was ordered to pay her $341,991 and $25,000 for attorney fees in 2015. Dash reportedly paid more than $1 million to be released.

<doc id="1172302" wikidata="Q263765" url="?curid=1172302" title="Betsy Palmer">
<text>Betsy Palmer (born Patricia Betsy Hrunek; November 1, 1926 – May 29, 2015) was an American actress known for her many film and Broadway roles, television guest-starring appearances, as a panelist on the game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, and later for playing the antagonist and mother of Jason Voorhees, Pamela Voorhees, in the first &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film (1980).

==Early life==
Palmer was born Patricia Betsy Hrunek on November 1, 1926, in East Chicago, Indiana, the daughter of Marie (née Love), an adoptee, who launched the East Chicago Business College before she married, and Vincent Rudolph Hrunek (1894-1969), an industrial chemist who immigrated from Czechoslovakia, and became a stay-at-home father. She performed in school plays all through childhood, graduated from East Chicago&#x27;s Roosevelt High School in 1944, then attended East Chicago Business College. After graduation, she worked as a stenographer and secretary for the car foreman on the RIP track of the B&amp;O Railroad. She hated it, she said, because she was shut off from people. Some time after Palmer took an aptitude test at the Chicago YWCA, which indicated a flair for the arts, her father brought a coworker home for dinner, a former New York actor who recommended she study with David Itkin. Working days and commuting to night classes from East Chicago, she graduated from the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University).

==Acting career==
Palmer began working in summer stock in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, then in winter stock at the Woodstock Opera House in Woodstock, Illinois, with Paul Newman, and then summer stock in Chicago with Imogene Coca. Having saved $400, she told her parents she was changing her name to Betsy Palmer and moving to New York City with Sasha Igler, who had a job in advertising. 

Palmer got her first television acting job in 1951 when she joined the cast of the 15-minute weekday television soap opera &quot;Miss Susan&quot;, which was produced in Philadelphia, and all actors traveled each day from New York City by train. She was &quot;discovered&quot; for this role by Norman Lessing while attending a party in the apartment of actor Frank Sutton, who was married to Toby Igler, the sister of Palmer&#x27;s roommate, Sasha Igler. She had been in Manhattan less than one week. 

A life member of the Actors Studio, Palmer&#x27;s stage work included a tour of &quot;South Pacific&quot; (as Nellie Forbush) and a summer-stock season in the title role in &quot;Maggie&quot;, the 1953 musical adaptation of &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; by William Roy and Hugh Thomas.

In 1953, she created the role of Virginia in the original teleplay version of Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Marty&quot;. Also in 1953, she appeared in a Studio One television broadcast of &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; with Jackie Cooper and others. She became a familiar face on television as a news reporter on &quot;Today&quot; in 1958 (the &quot;Today&quot; Girl), and a long-running regular panelist on the quiz show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. She joined the show&#x27;s original run, replacing Faye Emerson in 1958 and remaining until the show&#x27;s finale in 1967. She did not reprise her role in any of the various revivals of the show. Palmer was the last surviving member of the &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; first version&#x27;s cast.

Palmer appeared as Kitty Carter in &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; (1955), starring Tyrone Power and Maureen O&#x27;Hara. She also played nurse Lt. Ann Girard (the main female character) in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955), starring with Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, James Cagney, and William Powell. In the same year, she played Carol Lee Phillips in &quot;Queen Bee&quot;, which starred Joan Crawford.

Palmer starred alongside Anthony Perkins and Fonda again in the Paramount production of &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957).

In 1958, she played undercover agent Phyllis Carter/Lynn Stuart in the film &quot;The True Story of Lynn Stuart&quot;, co-starring Jack Lord and featuring Kim Spalding as her husband, Ralph Carter.

Palmer appeared in seven Broadway shows. All the original productions had short runs, but she replaced other actresses in long-run shows, notably Lauren Bacall in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; in 1967, and Ellen Burstyn in &quot;Same Time Next Year&quot; in 1977. In 1976, Palmer was the actress whom Tennessee Williams chose to embody the frustrated lead, Alma Winemiller, in his &quot;The Eccentricities of a Nightingale.&quot;

Palmer&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz stopped working on the highway to her home in Connecticut after a performance in New York City. To replace her car, her daughter suggested the Volkswagen Scirocco at a cost of $10,000. The offer of $1,000 a day for ten days work on location at a Boy Scout camp in New Jersey was a reason for taking a role in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. Her initial reaction to the experience was &quot;What a piece of shit! Nobody is ever going to see this thing.&quot; Despite her distaste for the film, she reluctantly consented to a cameo appearance in &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;. She ultimately came to accept and celebrate her participation in the franchise, eventually commenting &quot;I was dumb, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; is an excellent film.&quot; Palmer was asked to reprise her role as Mrs. Voorhees in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; in 2003 and agreed to return, but she ultimately turned down the role after being offered a surprisingly low salary.

In 1982, Palmer created the role of Suzanne Becker on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns.&quot; From 1989 to 1990, the actress appeared on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Bullock, the aunt of Valene Ewing (played by series star Joan Van Ark). Palmer acted in a Mayfield Dinner Theatre production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1997.

In 2002, Palmer provided the voice of the title character, the ghost of a witch, for the horror film &quot;Bell Witch: The Movie&quot;, released in 2007.

In 2005, at around 79 years old, she appeared as Trudie Tredwell in the horror short &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;, and in 2007, at 81, as the older version of the title character in &quot;Waltzing Anna&quot;.

Palmer appeared in the 2006 documentary, &quot;Betsy Palmer: Scream Queen Legend&quot;, as part of the publicity for the 2007 release of &quot;Bell Witch: The Movie&quot;.

==Personal life==
Palmer dated James Dean; the two met while working on an episode of &quot;Studio One&quot; television series. 

Palmer married Vincent J. Merendino, an obstetrician-gynecologist, in 1954, whom she met in New York on a blind date. They divorced in 1971 after 17 years. She had one daughter, Melissa.

==Death==
Palmer died of natural causes on May 29, 2015, at a hospice care center in Danbury, Connecticut. She was 88.

<doc id="1172310" wikidata="Q3433343" url="?curid=1172310" title="Ritualism in the Church of England">
<text>Ritualism, in the history of Christianity, refers to an emphasis on the rituals and liturgical ceremonies of the Church, specifically the Christian practice of Holy Communion.

In the Anglican church in the 19th century, the role of ritual became a contentious matter. The debate over this topic was also associated with struggles between the High Church and Low Church movements.
==Definition==
In Anglicanism, the term &quot;ritualist&quot; is often used to describe the revival of the second generation Oxford Movement/Anglo-Catholic/High Church, which sought to reintroduce a range of Roman Catholic liturgical practices to the Church of England. Ritualism is also seen as a controversial term (i.e., rejected by some of those to whom ritualism is applied).

===Common arguments===
Arguments about ritualism in the Church of England were often shaped by opposing (and often unannounced) attitudes towards the concept of and the nature of the authority of the Bible for Christians.

====For====
Those who support the ritualist outlook in the Church of England have often argued that the adoption of key elements of Roman Catholic ritual would:

* Give liturgical expression to the ecclesiological belief that the Church of England is more Catholic than Protestant;
* Give liturgical expression to a belief in the Real Presence and concomitantly that the Eucharist is the most important act of church worship and should be the norm;
* Be the most effective vehicle for giving expression to the worship of heaven as described in the Book of Revelation in which the use of white robes and incense in a setting of considerable beauty is described;
* Be a liturgical expression of the story in the book of Gospel of Matthew of the response of the Magi to the birth of Jesus who brought the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh as an act of adoration;
* Enable worshippers to use all of their senses in order to worship with the whole person and not just the mind;
* Be incarnational by placing emphasis on liturgical action and physical objects. Those in favour of ritualism argue that it draws attention to the importance that Christians should attach to the belief that, in Jesus, &quot;the Word became flesh&quot; (John 1). Those things are part of what God makes and saves and are not repudiated by him;
* Be the most effective form of worship for cultures that are either highly visual or have low literacy rates;
* Be an expression of the human response to God that calls on humans to offer their best in worship as a way of expressing the value (&quot;worth&quot;) that they place on God. Worship is, etymologically, &quot;worth-ship&quot;.

====Against====

Those who oppose ritualism in the Church of England have generally argued that it:

* Promotes idolatry by encouraging worshippers to focus on ritual objects and actions rather than the things they are meant to symbolize;
* Constitutes an attempt to wrest the Church of England from its Protestant identity;
* Constitutes a downgrading of the significance of preaching and biblical exposition in regular Christian worship;
* Encourages an idolatrous attitude to the Eucharist because ritualism is predicated on a belief in the Real Presence;
* Uses excessive elaborations in worship that cannot be justified on the basis of the descriptions of worship in the gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, or the Epistles in the New Testament. The robes used in the worship of heaven described in the Book of Revelation are plain white;
* Undermines a key Protestant belief that no human actions, even worship that has been precisely and carefully offered, can be of any value when it comes to being justified in the eyes of God: worship should be an unfussy, obedient, penitent, grateful, and spontaneously joyful response to the experience of being saved by faith alone in Jesus. Ritual and tradition are merely human inventions;
* Has often impeded the understanding of the gospel by wrapping up Christian worship in indecipherable symbolic acts;
* Is not beautiful as proponents claim but rather gaudy and distracting from contemplative worship.

==Ritualist controversies in the 19th century==
===Origins===

The development of ritualism in the Church of England was mainly associated with what is commonly called &quot;second generation&quot; Anglo-Catholicism (i.e., the Oxford Movement as developed after 1845 when John Henry Newman abandoned the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic). Some scholars argued that it was almost inevitable that some of the leaders of Anglo-Catholicism would turn their attention to questions of liturgy and ritual and started to champion the use of practices and forms of worship more commonly associated with Roman Catholicism. However, there was only limited enthusiasm amongst ritualists to introduce the widespread use of Latin in the liturgy, which was the norm in the Roman Catholic Church before Vatican II.
The leaders of the first generation of the Anglo-Catholic revival or Oxford Movement (i.e., Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Keble) had been primarily concerned with theological and ecclesiological questions and had little concern with questions of ritual. They championed the view that the fundamental identity of the Church of England was Catholic rather than Protestant. They argued that Anglicans were bound by obedience to use the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. &quot;Tract 3&quot; of the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot; series had strenuously argued against any revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, viewing its use as a matter of absolute obligation. Even &quot;Tract 90&quot;, which analyzed the 39 Articles, was more concerned with the theological dimension of the issue. It gave little attention to the question of altering current liturgical practice in the Church of England.

The ecclesiological questions gave rise to an interest in giving liturgical expression to the theological conviction that the Church of England had sustained a fundamentally Catholic character after the English Reformation. In some circles, the shift of focus to the question of liturgy proved as provocative as had been the theological assertions of the first generation of Anglo-Catholicism.

The clearest illustration of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical questions is to be found in Pusey&#x27;s attitude towards ritualism. Pusey, the only pre-eminent first-generation leader of Anglo-Catholicism to survive into the second generation, had no sympathy with the preoccupation with ritual. However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.

===Early controversies in the 19th century===
====&quot;Bells and smells&quot;: the controversial ritual practices====
From the 1850s to the 1890s, several liturgical practices espoused by many ritualists led to some occasional and intense local controversies, some of which led to prosecutions (most notably as a result of the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874). Those considered most important by adherents of the Catholic movement were known as the &quot;six points&quot;:
* the use of Eucharistic vestments such as the chasuble, stole, alb and maniple
* the use of a thurible and incense
* the use of &quot;lights&quot; (especially the practice of putting six candles on the high altar)
* the use of unleavened (wafer) bread in communion
* eastward facing celebration of the Eucharist (when the priest celebrates facing the altar from the same side as the people (i.e., the priest faces east with the people instead of standing at the &quot;north side&quot; of the &quot;table&quot; placed in the chancel or body of the church, as required by the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;))
* the mixing of sacramental wine with water

Other contentious practices included:
* the use of Catholic terminology such as describing the Eucharist as the &quot;Mass&quot;
* the use of bells at the elevation of the host
* making the sign of the cross
* the use of liturgical processions
* the decoration of churches with statues of saints, pictures of religious scenes, and icons
* the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the practice of the invocation of the saints
* the practice of Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament
* the use of the words of Benedictus at the end of the Sanctus in the eucharistic prayer
* the use of the words of the Agnus Dei in the Eucharist

In regards to the &quot;north side&quot; celebration, at the time of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would celebrate the Mass standing at the front of the altar. Beginning with the rubrics of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI published in 1552, and through the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (which prevailed for almost 300 years), the priest is directed to stand &quot;at the north syde of the Table.&quot; This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would be sitting in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel (facing a congregation seated in the nave). The last option copies the practice of the Early Church when the celebrant stood before a small stone or marble table, usually rectangular, facing the nave.

The ritualist movement (see Cambridge Camden Society) also played a substantial role in promoting:
* the restoration of chancels in parish churches; and
* the use of robed choirs seated in the chancel accompanied by a pipe organ rather than by a Church band and seated in a west gallery at the back of the church.
The prosecution and conviction of Arthur Tooth in 1876, Sidney Faithorn Green in 1879, and Richard William Enraght in 1880, illustrate the controversies caused by these liturgical practices. The prosecutions, which were often instigated by the Church Association, gave considerable impetus to the foundation and work of the English Church Union. The Society of the Holy Cross (SSC) played a crucial role in championing and developing the use of elements of proscribed Catholic ritual in Anglicanism.

====Perception of ritualism as a threat to English identity====
For many who opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend what they saw as the fundamentally Protestant identity of the Church of England. This was also not just a matter of an ecclesiological argument; for many, there was a sense that Catholic worship was somehow &quot;un-English&quot;. Catholicism was deeply associated with cultural identities that historically had been treated with suspicion by many English people, especially the Spanish, French, and Irish.

For an ideological defense of this position, it was argued that English identity was closely linked with England&#x27;s history as a Protestant country that, after the Reformation, had played a key role in opposing Catholic powers in Continental Europe, especially Spain and then France. In the minds of such people, Protestantism was inextricably identified with anti-despotic values and Catholicism with autocracy that, in the religious arena, hid behind the &quot;disguise&quot; of complicated rituals whose meaning deliberately lacked transparency. The opposition to ritualism, therefore, had a deeply cultural and symbolic significance that extended far beyond purely theological concerns.

Ritualists themselves were often eager to try and present the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the ritual they championed by predominantly keeping English as the language of the liturgy and reconstructing Anglo-Catholicism as a recovery of pre-Reformation Catholic forms that were specifically English; a revival of interest in the Sarum Rite (the pre-Reformation Catholic liturgy of Salisbury) was sparked off by the Ritualist movement. This tendency was also often expressed as the revival in the use of the pre-Reformation Gothic forms rather than the Baroque, the latter of which was more closely linked in the minds of many with specifically continental and Counter Reformation forms.

====Ritualism and Christian socialism====
Although ritualism had an aesthetic and ideological appeal for many in the cultural elite, as well as a cognate relationship with the Gothic Revival, the idea that it was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically conservative and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (i.e., Viscount Halifax and the 4th Marquess of Bath). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist clergy themselves, many of whom inevitably operated in some of the most deprived communities in England, resulted in them becoming politically radicalized, with some becoming ardent Christian socialists.

====Anti-ritualism and &quot;muscular Christianity&quot;====
In the spectrum of hostility that it aroused, ritualism also provoked in some of its opponents a reaction that saw its theatricality and its aestheticism as symptoms of &quot;effeminacy&quot;. A typical charge was that ritualistic clergy were &quot;man milliners&quot;, who were more concerned with lace and brocade than doctrine. Adverse reaction to this played a significant role in the evolution of the Broad and Low Church enthusiasm for muscular Christianity.

===Ritualism and outreach to the unchurched urban poor===
One of the key ideological justifications used by many of the early ritualists, apart from the fact that it was a symbolic way of affirming their belief in the essentially Catholic nature of Anglicanism, was the argument that it provided a particularly effective medium for bringing Christianity to the poorest &quot;slum parishes&quot; of the Church of England.

It was argued that ritual and aesthetically impressive liturgy did not only provide a powerful contrast to the drabness of the lives of the poor, but its emphasis on symbol and action rather than word was a more effective medium for spreading Christian faith in areas with poor literacy rates than the highly cerebral and logocentric worship that focused on the Book of Common Prayer. This argument may have had some merits, but, very often, the respect that the most successful ritualists often gained in the highly impoverished communities they went to serve was based on the fact that they had expressed a genuine pastoral concern for the poor amongst whom they lived.

The argument for ritualism in Anglicanism was also based on the analogy of the success of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the highly impoverished Irish migrant communities in the urban areas of England. It was argued by some that ritual played a key role in the growth of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the poor. However, the use of ritual probably played little more than a subsidiary role in the success of the Catholic Church in this area. Instead, its success was probably largely due to a special cultural identity that many Irish migrants felt with the Roman Catholic Church as one of the few institutions that they encountered in diaspora that was also a feature of life in their homeland.

===Legacy of the controversies===
The ritualists&#x27; use of vestments and wafer bread have become widespread, even normative, in the Church of England for much of the 20th century.

Although many members of the Church of England today still feel uncomfortable or skeptical about certain &#x27;Catholic&#x27; or &#x27;Romish&#x27; liturgical practices, they would be astonished to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar, having the mixed cup, making the sign of the Cross over the congregation, and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots and lead to the prosecution and imprisonment priests, such as the prosecution of Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln, between 1888 and 1890. The lasting legacy is that the Ritualists won; the current liturgical style in its various manifestations in almost all Anglican parishes worldwide is much closer to the way Mass was celebrated 500 years ago even in Low Church and &#x27;mid-range&#x27; parishes.

<text>John Lewis Gervais (1741–1798) was an American planter and statesman from South Carolina. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783.

==Life and career==
John was born in Hanover, Germany where his parents were French Huguenot refugees in 1741. He emigrated to South Carolina, arriving in Charleston in 1764. He started in the mercantile business, but soon expanded his interests to include a plantation.

Gervais first served in the revolutionary Provincial Congress in 1775. He was a member of the state&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; from 1775 to 1781. Under the new state government, he was elected to South Carolina&#x27;s Senate in 1781 and 1782.

The legislature sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1782 and 1783. On 10 September 1782, he voted for a motion that the secretary for foreign affairs be directed to obtain returns of slaves and property carried off by the enemy during the war, such information to be used in negotiating a peace. In April 1783, he was a member of a committee to which were referred letters from U.S. representatives abroad, and on 15 April of that year favored instructing the commander-in-chief to arrange with the commander of the British forces for receiving possession of the posts in the United States that were occupied by British troops.

He came home in 1784, and was returned to the State Senate. In 1786, Senator Gervais led the efforts in the legislature to establish a new state capital. The result was the founding of Columbia, South Carolina.

He died in Charleston on 18 August 1798 and is buried in St. Phillip&#x27;s Churchyard there.

<text>The 1st Panzer-Division (short: 1. Pz.Div. , English: 1st Tank Division) was an armoured division in the German Army during World War II.

The division was one of the original three tank divisions established by Germany in 1935. It took part in pre-war occupations of Austria and Czechoslovakia and the invasions of Poland in 1939 and Belgium and France in 1940. From 1941 to 1945, it fought on the Eastern Front, except for a period in 1943 when it was sent for refitting to France and Greece. At the end of the war, the division surrendered to US forces in Bavaria.

==History==
The 1st Panzer Division was formed on 15 October 1935 from the 3rd Cavalry Division, and was headquartered in Weimar. It was one of three tank divisions created at the time, the other two being the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Division. Earlier in the year, Germany had renounced the Treaty of Versailles, which had forbidden the country, among other things, from having tank forces, a treaty Germany had violated almost from the start by secretly developing tanks and operating a covert tank school in the Soviet Union.

Initially, the division consisted of two panzer regiments organized into a brigade, a motorized infantry brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, a divisional artillery regiment, and supporting ancillary formations. The division was equipped with the light Panzer I and Panzer II tanks, with the very first pre-production versions of the more powerful Panzer III Ausf A. arriving by November 1937 for testing, and the first examples of the Panzer IV Ausf. A being delivered from around the same time, and by June 1938 by the latest. While the Pz I saw service in large numbers in Poland in 1939, the division was still using its Panzer II&#x27;s in 1941.

In 1938, the division participated in the Anschluss of Austria and the occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938 and the subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. In September 1939, the 1st Panzer Division took part in the invasion of Poland, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw after eight days. After Warsaw the division was moved to support the 18th Infantry Division before returning to Germany in November 1939, after the Polish surrender.
In May 1940, the 1st Panzer Division was part of the invasion of France, Luxembourg and Belgium. It took part in the battles of Sedan and Dunkirk before swinging south to participate in the attack on the Weygand Line. It advanced towards the Swiss border and occupied Belfort before the surrender of France. During the battle of France, the division suffered relatively low casualties, having just under 500 men killed in action.

The 1st Panzer Division remained in France until September 1940, when it was moved to East Prussia. It supplied a substantial number of units to the new 16th and 18th Panzer Divisions. From 22 June 1941, it took part of Operation Barbarossa, crossing the former German-Lithuanian frontier as part of the Army Group North and the 4th Panzer Group. The division was involved in heavy fighting and, by mid-August, had only 44, of the 155 tanks it had started out with less than two month earlier, left in serviceable condition. It continued to advance towards Leningrad until early October when it was transferred to the Army Group Centre to take part in the advance on Moscow. The division advanced within on Moscow before being forced to retreat during the Soviet counterattack.

The division was part of the defence of the Rzhev Salient during early 1942, initially being very short on tanks and fighting predominantly as infantry until being resupplied during spring. The 1st Panzer Division was engaged in the defence of the supply lines of the 9th Army in the centre of the Eastern Front. It suffered heavy casualties during the defence against repeated Soviet attacks in the Winter of 1942–43 before eventually being transferred back to France in January 1943 for refitting. After months in northern France, the division was sent to occupied Greece in June 1943 because of the perceived threat of an Allied landing there. Instead, the landing took place in Sicily and the division participated in the disarming of Italian forces in Greece when the former defected from the Axis in September 1943. The 1st Panzer Division was brought up to full strength again in October when it received a substantial number of Panther tanks and returned to the Eastern Front again shortly thereafter.

On 20 November 1943, the 1st Panzer Division possessed 140 operational tanks, making it the second-best equipped armored divisions, behind only 1st SS Panzer Division with 155 tanks.

The 1st Panzer Division was engaged in the southern sector of the Eastern Front to serve alternately within the 1st and 4th Panzer Army as an emergency force. It was constantly thrown from crisis location to crisis location as the German front lines retreated, taking part in battles at Kiev, Zhitomir and Cherkassy. The latter battle saw the division attempting to break through to the cauldron but falling just short. By March 1944, the division had been reduced to just over 25 percent of its nominal strength. Retreating further westwards, the division was part of the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket and, from there, took part in the defence of eastern Poland and Hungary. It was engaged in defensive operations around Lake Balaton and took part in the unsuccessful attempt to break through to the Siege of Budapest and once more suffered heavy losses.

The final month of the Second World War saw the division engaged in the defence of Styria. From there, it retreated westwards to surrender to US forces rather than Soviet ones, successfully crossing the demarcation line between the two. It surrendered on 8 May 1945 in southern Bavaria and most of its soldiers were released from captivity soon after.

<doc id="1172330" wikidata="Q2825720" url="?curid=1172330" title="Afel Bocoum">
<text>Afel Bocoum (born 1955) is a musician from Mali, noted as a singer and guitarist. He began his career as a member of Ali Farka Touré&#x27;s group ASCO, and Toure is often regarded as his mentor. Both men come from the town of Niafunke on the River Niger, and are members of the Sonrai people. Bocoum is an agricultural advisor by profession.

==Musical style==
His group, Alkibar (the name means &#x27;messenger of the great river&#x27; in Sonrai) consists of two acoustic guitars, a njarka (a one-string fiddle), a njurkle (a kind of lute), calabash and djembe percussion, and two female singers as well as male singers in the choruses. Bocoum is the lead vocalist. Bocoum uses music as a medium of communication, commenting on contemporary Malian society, e.g., &quot;if you betray one woman, you betray all women&quot; (Yarabitala), &quot;we live in a crazy world with no respect; tomorrow we&#x27;ll be judged by our children&quot; (Salamm aleikum), &quot;parents, do not force your daughters to marry; a home will never flourish without true love&quot; (Mali woymoyo).

Most of his singing is done in Sonrai, his native language, but also in Tamasheq (the language of the Tuareg) and in Fulfulde (the language of the Fula people). Bocoum&#x27;s father was a musician and was noted locally for his ability to play the njarka and njurkel, which he employed to play music at weddings. Bocoum used to accompany his father to the weddings and there learnt the songs of the se galarare style of music. He retained his preference for acoustic over electric guitar, and the use of traditional instruments. As well as the Malian musicians he grew up with, Bocoum cites Jorge Ben Jor, Mamadou Doumbia, Salif Keita, John Lee Hooker, and Mongo Santamaría as his musical influences.

==Career history==
In 1968, at the age of thirteen, he joined the group of guitarist Ali Farka Touré and singer Harber Maiga as an apprentice. It was Maiga who taught Bocoum to sing and to write songs until his death on 23 March 1983. Bocoum&#x27;s first solo performance came in 1968 at a musical competition in Mopti. He was well received by the public. In 1972 he performed in front of 3000 people at Mali&#x27;s second in Bamako, which was held every two years from 1970 to 1990, when Musa Traore was overthrown. The Bambara people were dominant in Malian affairs at that time and because of his Sonrai ethnicity, Bocoum was only awarded second prize.

He left the Niafunke group in 1975 when he won a scholarship to an agricultural college in M&#x27;Pessoba, near Koutiala in the southeast of the country. After three years of study he began working in Djenné, before returning to his home town, and the group, in 1980. In 1982 he was invited to join the Orchestre Diaba Regional from Timbuktu. In the early 1980s he formed Alkibar, and influenced by his knowledge of agriculture, used their music to communicate with people about water and irrigation.

His debut album, &quot;Alkibar&quot;, was recorded in an abandoned school near Niafunke over the course of six days - the same session and location where the Ali Farka Touré&#x27;s &quot;Niafunke&quot; was recorded. In fact, Ali Farka and Bocoum appeared on each other&#x27;s albums. Bocoum and Ali Farka&#x27;s record producer believed that transporting the group to a recording studio overseas would diminish the quality of the music.

In 2002 Bocoum collaborated with the Blur singer Damon Albarn on the successful &quot;Mali Music&quot; album, and the two played together in concerts in London and Denmark.

In 2005, Bocoum composed the music and starred in the movie Kennis voor het leven.

In 2006, Afel Bocoum and his band, Alkibar, released their second full-length album &quot;Niger&quot; on the Belgian label Contre-Jour. The sounds of &quot;Niger&quot; rely heavily on the traditional instruments njarka and njurkel, which give this collection of new materials a more traditional, and distinctively different quality from their excellent Western debut, &quot;Alkibar&quot;. &quot;Niger&quot; opens with a heartfelt and stirring tribute to his late mentor, Ali Farka Touré.

There is a curiosity about a visit made by Afel Bocoum in 2001 in Brazil. On this visit, Bocoum said his name &quot;Afel&quot; was like &quot;Affection&quot;, showing what he felt for all Brazilians. 
Today, after 10 years many Brazilians use the word &quot;Afel&quot; to symbolize &quot;Affection&quot;.

As of 2011, Afel is touring as part of the second iteration of Acoustic Africa.

<text>Alpine Skiing at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] consisted of ten alpine skiing events. The speed events were held at Hakuba and the technical events at Shiga Kogen. There were a number of race postponements due to weather; the events began on 10 February and ended on 21 February.

==Medal summary==
Nine nations won medals in alpine skiing, with Austria winning the most with eleven (3 gold, 4 silver, 4 bronze). Katja Seizinger led the individual medal table, with two gold medals and a bronze, while Hermann Maier was the most successful male skier, with two gold medals. Zali Steggall&#x27;s bronze medal was the first individual medal at the Winter Olympics for Australia.

<doc id="1172333" wikidata="Q1425185" url="?curid=1172333" title="Hairy leukoplakia">
<text>Hairy leukoplakia is a white patch on the side of the tongue with a corrugated or hairy appearance. It is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and occurs usually in persons who are immunocompromised, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The white lesion, which cannot be scraped off, is benign and does not require any treatment, although its appearance may have diagnostic and prognostic implications for the underlying condition.

Depending upon what definition of leukoplakia is used, hairy leukoplakia is sometimes considered a subtype of leukoplakia, or a distinct diagnosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are no symptoms associated with the lesion itself, although many and varied symptoms and signs may be associated with the underlying cause of immunosuppression. The lesion is a white patch, which almost exclusively occurs on the lateral surfaces of the tongue, although rarely it may occur on the buccal mucosa, soft palate, pharynx or esophagus. The lesion may grow to involve the dorsal surface of the tongue. The texture is vertically corrugated (&quot;hairy&quot;) or thickly furrowed and shaggy in appearance.

==Causes==
The white appearance is created by hyperkeratosis (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia. The causative agent implicated is Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). After the primary EBV infection has been overcome, the virus will persist for the rest of the host&#x27;s life and &quot;hides&quot; from the immune system by latent infection of B lymphocytes. The virus also causes lytic infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled lytic infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.

==Diagnosis==
The white lesion cannot be wiped away, unlike some other common oral white lesions, e.g. pseudomembranous candidiasis, and this may aid in the diagnosis. Diagnosis of OHL is mainly clinical, but can be supported by proof of EBV in the lesion (achieved by in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, Southern blotting, or electron microscopy) and HIV serotesting. When clinical appearance alone is used to diagnose OHL, there is a false positive rate of 17% compared to more objective methods. The appearance of OHL in a person who is known to be infected with HIV does not usually require further diagnostic tests as the association is well known. OHL in persons with no known cause of immunocompromise usually triggers investigations to look for an underlying cause. If tissue biopsy is carried out, the histopathologic appearance is of hyperplastic and parakeratinized epithelium, with &quot;balloon cells&quot; (lightly staining cells) in the upper stratum spinosum and &quot;nuclear beading&quot; in the superficial layers (scattered cells with peripheral margination of chromatin and clear nuclei, created by displacement of chromatin to the peripheral nucleus by EBV replication). Candida usually is seen growing in the parakeratin layer, but there are no normal inflammatory reactions to this in the tissues. There is no dysplasia (OHL is not a premalignant lesion).

===Classification===
In a classification of the oral lesions in HIV disease, OHL is grouped as &quot;lesions strongly associated with HIV infection&quot; (group I). It could also be classed as an opportunistic, viral disease. Hairy leukoplakia occurs on the tongue and has a similar name to hairy tongue, but these are separate conditions with different causes.

==Treatment==
Treatment is not necessary since the lesion is benign, however, the person may have aesthetic concerns about the appearance. The condition often resolves rapidly with high dose acyclovir or desiclovir but recurs once this therapy is stopped, or as the underlying immunocompromise worsens. Topical use of podophyllum resin or retinoids has also been reported to produce temporary remission.

Antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine may be effective in producing a significant regression of OHL. Recurrence of the lesion may also signify that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is becoming ineffective.

==Prognosis==
The oral lesion itself is benign and self-limiting, however this may not necessarily be the case for the underlying cause of immunocompromise. For instance, OHL with HIV/AIDS is a predictor of bad prognosis, (i.e. severe immunosuppression and advanced disease).

==Epidemiology==
Hairy leukoplakia is one of the most common oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS, along with oral candidiasis. It is the most common HIV/AIDS related condition caused by EBV, although EBV associated lymphomas may also occur. OHL mainly occurs in adult males, less commonly in adult females and rarely in children. The incidence rises as the CD4 count falls, and the appearance of OHL may signify progression of HIV to AIDS. A study from 2001 reported a significant decrease in the incidence of some oral manifestations of AIDS (including OHL and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis), which was attributed to the use of HAART, whilst the incidence of other HIV-associated oral lesions did not alter significantly.

==History==
Oral hairy leukoplakia was discovered by Deborah Greenspan and John S. Greenspan, and in 1985 they identified a connection between it and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Oral hairy leukoplakia was first described by Greenspan &quot;et al.&quot; in 1984, a few years after the start of the AIDS epidemic. A link with OHL was not initially reported as scientific understanding of HIV/AIDS was just beginning to develop at that time. It was subsequently thought to occur only in HIV-infected, homosexual males, however, this is now known to not always be the case.

==Research directions==
It has been suggested that OHL be renamed according to its causative factor as “EBV leucoplakia”.

<doc id="1172337" wikidata="Q407694" url="?curid=1172337" title="Air Nostrum">
<text>Air Nostrum (doing business as Iberia Regional) is a Spanish regional airline based in Valencia.

An affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance, it operates 91 domestic and international routes to 51 destinations, and charter flights. Its main base is Valencia Airport, with hubs at Barcelona–El Prat Airport and Madrid–Barajas Airport.

Limited operations are also carried out on behalf of Brussels Airlines, replacing related wet-lease specialist airline CityJet, having begun in late 2018. Air Nostrum is also a part owner of Iryo, a Spanish high-speed rail service which began operating in November 2022.

In October 2023, it was announced that Air Nostrum had completed its merger with CityJet. Furthermore, it was reported that its current shareholders would have controlling interest (80%) of the entity created from the merger, Strategic Alliance of Regional Airlines (SARA).

==History==

The airline was established on 23 May 1994 and started operations on 15 December. It used to offer a comprehensive meal service on all scheduled flights.

In early 2008, the airline eliminated its &#x27;regional business class&#x27; cabin. The cabin is now split into separate business and economy sections along the lines of other major airlines. Economy passengers can purchase drinks and snacks from an onboard menu.

On February 7, 2012, Air Nostrum presented an ERE (a legal form of workforce reduction and redundancies) that will affect its 1,800 workers for two years, due to the increase in fuel prices and the drop in income. It is estimated that during the two years, 15 Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft will be grounded and most of its routes will be abandoned at a loss.

On March 31, 2014, the airline announced the entry into the company&#x27;s capital of a group of Valencian businessmen with the participation of the then CEO of the company, Carlos Bertomeu, as well as Antonio Pellicer and José Remohí, owners of the IVI, with an estimated capital of 25 million euros, divided between capital and debt.

In September 2017, it filed an application to operate high speed rail services from Madrid Atocha to Gare de Montpellier-Saint-Roch in Southern France from 5 October 2018 with AVE Class 100 trains leased from Renfe Operadora.

On 17 July 2018, Air Nostrum and CityJet of Ireland announced they would merge to form the largest regional airline in Europe, however will remain as separate brands. The merger was completed in 2023.

In June 2022, it was announced that Air Nostrum had placed a reservation on ten Hybrid Air Vehicles Airlander 10 airships. Introduction to service is scheduled for 2026. In August 2023, Air Nostrum doubled their reservation from ten to twenty HAV Airlander 10 aircraft.

==Fleet==

As of January 2025, the Air Nostrum fleet consists of the following aircraft:

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 17 January 2003, an Air Nostrum Fokker 50 overran the runway at Melilla Airport and crashed into the perimeter fence resulting in the aircraft splitting into two major parts. Nine passengers were injured.
*On 24 January 2006, Air Nostrum flight IB 8665 from Valladolid made a belly landing at Barcelona El Prat Airport. Two of the forty passengers sustained minor injuries while disembarking from the aircraft, a Bombardier CRJ200 with registration EC-IBM. The cause was determined by the Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil to be pilot error.

<doc id="1172362" wikidata="Q173284" url="?curid=1172362" title="Clay Regazzoni">
<text>Gianclaudio Giuseppe&quot;Clay&quot;Regazzoni (; 5 September 1939 – 15 December 2006) was a Swiss racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Regazzoni was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won five Grands Prix across 11 seasons.

Regazzoni competed in Formula One for 11 seasons, winning five Grands Prix. His first win was the Italian Grand Prix at Monza in his debut season, driving for Ferrari. He remained with the Italian team until . After a single season with BRM, Regazzoni returned to Ferrari for a further three years from (where he was the runner-up to Emerson Fittipaldi) to . After finally leaving Ferrari at the end of 1976, Regazzoni joined the Ensign and Shadow teams, before moving to Williams in , where he took the British team&#x27;s first ever Grand Prix victory, the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

Regazzoni was replaced by Carlos Reutemann at Williams for 1980 and moved back to Ensign. Following an accident at the 1980 United States Grand Prix West, he was left paralyzed from the waist down, ending his career in Formula One. Regazzoni did not stop racing, and he competed in the Paris–Dakar rally and Sebring 12 Hours using a hand-controlled car during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1996, Regazzoni became a commentator for Italian TV. He was known as a hard-charging racer. Jody Scheckter stated that if &quot;he&#x27;d been a cowboy he&#x27;d have been the one in the black hat&quot;. Regazzoni died in a car accident in Italy on 15 December 2006.

==Personal and early life==
Gianclaudio Regazzoni was born in Mendrisio, Switzerland, on 5 September 1939, a few days after the start of the Second World War. Regazzoni grew up in Porza, in the Canton of Ticino, part of the Italian speaking region of Switzerland. He was married to Maria Pia, with whom he had two children: Alessia and Gian Maria.

==Racing career==

===Pre-Formula One===

====Early racing and Formula Three====
Regazzoni first started competing in car races in 1963, at the comparatively late age of 24. Many of his early motorsport experiences were across the border in Italy, Switzerland having banned motor racing following the horrific accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race. His first outings were in his own Austin-Healey Sprite, with which he took two podium finishes from only his first three races. This instant success encouraged Regazzoni to move up to a Mini Cooper for the 1964 club racing season.

1965 saw Clay Regazzoni behind the wheel of an open-wheeled car for the first time, as he entered the European Formula Three championship with a Brabham. This first season brought moderate success, and improving form during 1966 (this time driving a De Tomaso) brought him to the attention of ambitious Italian constructor Tecno. Tecno offered Regazzoni the use of one of their F3 chassis for 1967, where his reliable, fast performances earned him the offer of a works Tecno drive in Formula Two for the following year. Despite this, Regazzoni continued to drive in Formula Three events during 1968 and, not for the last time, was lucky to survive a major accident. Exiting the chicane during the Monaco Grand Prix Formula 3 support race, Regazzoni lost control of his car and collided heavily with the crash barrier. The diminutive size of the Formula 3 machine allowed it to pass under the rail, the sharp metal edge of the Armco slicing across the top of the open cockpit. Regazzoni managed to duck down low enough in the driving seat for the rail to pass above him, missing his head by a tiny margin. The car eventually came to a halt when the roll hoop, behind Regazzoni&#x27;s head and significantly lower than the top of his helmet, wedged itself underneath the barrier.

====Formula Two====
In Formula Two, Regazzoni had found the ideal partner in Tecno. His hard-charging style perfectly matched the forward-thinking Tecno ambitions, and Regazzoni quickly developed a reputation as a tough competitor. Regazzoni was implicated in the death of young British driver Chris Lambert at the 1968 Formula Two Dutch Grand Prix. Some observers accused Regazzoni, who was running well up the field, of deliberately running Lambert&#x27;s Brabham off the track while lapping him. Lambert lost control and crashed into a bridge. Even though Regazzoni had been fully exonerated at the subsequent inquest, rumours persisted for many years afterwards. Lambert&#x27;s father pursued a private action against Regazzoni, which dragged on for five years before finally being abandoned. Regazzoni remained with Tecno throughout his three years in Formula Two, although he drove most of the 1969 season for the Ferrari Formula Two team. In 1970, they took the European Formula Two Championship together.

====Sports car racing====

As well as single seater racing, Regazzoni participated in sports car racing, including the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans where he and Arturo Merzario raced a Ferrari 512S. However, the pair retired after completing only 38 laps. This would prove to be Regazzoni&#x27;s only appearance at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, although he tested for the 1972 event.

For the following two years, Regazzoni was a permanent fixture in Ferrari&#x27;s sports car racing squad. With the new 312B-based 312P cars underneath him, Regazzoni regularly ran at or near the front of the field. Regularly partnered with Jacky Ickx, the pairing took second place in the BOAC 1000 km at Brands Hatch in 1971, and won the first heat during the Imola 500 km. Regazzoni also won the Kyalami 9 Hours race, this time in partnership with Brian Redman. Further successes followed in 1972, with second places at the 1000 km Buenos Aires, partnered again by Redman, and the prestigious Spa 1000 km race. The high point of the season came when the Regazzoni/Ickx partnership won the Monza 1000 km race.

With his departure from Ferrari in 1973, Regazzoni&#x27;s sports car results dried up. His uncompetitive Alfa Romeo 33 TT was thoroughly outclassed by the Ferrari and Matra opposition. At the end of 1973 Ferrari withdrew from sports car racing, and Regazzoni&#x27;s move to rejoin the Ferrari Formula One team in 1974 effectively ended his sports car career, as he could not then race for other manufacturers.

===Formula One===
====1970–72: Ferrari====

During the early races of the 1970 Formula One season Ferrari only entered one car, for Belgian Jacky Ickx, but at the fourth round in Belgium, the team decided to run a second car to try out some younger drivers. Italian Ignazio Giunti was given the second seat in Belgium, where he finished fourth, while Regazzoni took his place at the following round in the Netherlands, also finishing fourth. Giunti was back in the seat for the following Grand Prix in France, but finished fourteenth, three laps behind the winner and eventual 1970 World Champion Jochen Rindt.

Regazzoni was back in the Ferrari for the British Grand Prix, where he finished fourth again, but this time Regazzoni kept the race seat. Four podium finishes followed for Regazzoni during the final six rounds of the 1970 season, including a win at Monza, Ferrari&#x27;s home race. However, the race was overshadowed by the death of Championship leader Rindt, during qualifying for the race. A first pole position, at the final round in Mexico, capped a hugely successful first season in the top formula. Regazzoni finished third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 33 points, 12  points behind posthumous World Champion Rindt.

Following the death of Giunti at a sports car event during the winter of 1971, Ferrari opted for Ickx and Regazzoni for the 1971 Formula One season. Prior to the start of the European legs of the Formula One World Championship, Regazzoni won the prestigious Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, beating Jackie Stewart into second place. Despite this early promise, the Ferrari 312B and B2 proved to be inferior to the Stewart/Tyrrell 003 combination. Regazzoni only managed three podium finishes during the season, as well as a pole position at the British Grand Prix. The Swiss finished seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship that year, 49 points behind World Champion Jackie Stewart.

Further disappointment for Regazzoni followed in 1972, with only a single podium finish, in Germany, although he scored two points more than the previous season. Regazzoni again finished seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 46 points behind World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi.

====1973: BRM====
Regazzoni opted to leave Ferrari in 1973, in favour of Marlboro-sponsored BRM for what was reported as &quot;an astronomical fee&quot;. Here he joined young driver Niki Lauda, and the two became firm friends. After a huge crash during the South African Grand Prix, he was pulled from the blazing wreckage by Mike Hailwood, who was later awarded the George Medal for his heroism in saving Regazzoni&#x27;s life. It proved to be an unsuccessful year for Regazzoni, despite a pole position in the 1973 Argentine Grand Prix season opener. He was reported to have become disillusioned with &quot;uncompetitive machinery&quot; as he scored just two points during the entire season, his worst points haul from a full season in Formula One. He achieved a lowly 17th place in the championship.

====1974–76: Back to Ferrari====

Ferrari had a big personnel shake-up at the start of 1974, after Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was hired to run the Italian team. Both Regazzoni and, on Regazzoni&#x27;s recommendation, Lauda were picked up by Ferrari. Regazzoni was soon back on the podium. Seven podium finishes, including a win in Germany, his first since his debut season win at Monza four years earlier, as well as a pole position at Nivelles, allowed Regazzoni to outscore the up-and-coming Lauda. Entering the last race of the season, in the USA Regazzoni was well in contention for the title, and only needed to finish ahead of rival, Emerson Fittipaldi, to take the crown. Regazzoni suffered handling problems during the race due to a defective shock absorber and could finish only 11th after two pit stops. He finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, his career-best, just three points behind Fittipaldi.

Ferrari retained Lauda and Regazzoni&#x27;s services for 1975 and the pair took six victories between them: five for Lauda, and one for Regazzoni at the 1975 Italian Grand Prix. Regazzoni also won his home Grand Prix, the non-championship Swiss Grand Prix, the only Swiss driver to have done so. Ferrari secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship, and Lauda won the first of his three World titles. Regazzoni finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 25 points.
1976 would prove to be the start of Regazzoni&#x27;s downward slide in Formula One. Despite a promising start of the season, with a dominating win from pole position at the inaugural Long Beach Grand Prix, and a further three podium finishes, Ferrari entered a period of internal turmoil following Lauda&#x27;s accident at the Nürburgring. Following Lauda&#x27;s loss of the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the very last race of the season in Japan, Ferrari elected to replace the Swiss with Carlos Reutemann despite Lauda&#x27;s protest. The Argentine never got on with Lauda as well as Regazzoni did. When he left Ferrari, Regazzoni was the longest serving Ferrari driver with 73 races with the team. The record would hold for 12 years until Michele Alboreto broke it at the 1988 Hungarian Grand Prix.

====1977: Ensign====
Following his release from Ferrari, Regazzoni opted for a move to the Ensign team. His move to such a small team surprised some, but Regazzoni opted for the small outfit in preference to an offer from Bernie Ecclestone to drive for Brabham, as he preferred &quot;to race with nice people&quot;. His season with Ensign, despite managing a points finish on his debut in Argentina, was not successful. Regazzoni finished in the points only a further two times, and ended the season with a total of five points. In May Regazzoni participated in the Indianapolis 500 driving a McLaren-Offenhauser for Theodore Racing. He crashed heavily in practice but managed to qualify. He finished in 30th place after a fuel cell gave out during his first pit stop.

====1978: Shadow====
Regazzoni moved to Shadow in 1978, as a replacement for Alan Jones who had left to join Williams. Only two points scoring finishes followed for Regazzoni and he finished the season 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 60 points behind World Champion Mario Andretti.

====1979: Williams====

Frank Williams gave Regazzoni his final drive in a competitive car alongside Alan Jones. The Williams FW07 proved to be very competitive, especially in the final part of the season, with FW07s winning all but two of the final seven races of the 1979 calendar. The first win was for Regazzoni, at Silverstone, the first of over 100 victories for the Williams Grand Prix team. In deference to the team&#x27;s Saudi sponsors, he celebrated on the podium with Lilt. However, despite his achievement, once again he was replaced by Carlos Reutemann at the end of the season. At the Italian Grand Prix, motorsport journalist Nigel Roebuck asked Regazzoni why he continued to drive at the age of 40, with no prospect of a competitive seat. Regazzoni replied, &quot;I love [Formula One], and most of all I love to drive racing cars. So why should I stop when I feel this way?&quot;. At the end of the year he was invited to compete in the 1980 International Race of Champions, the last active Formula One driver, alongside Mario Andretti, to do so.

====1980: Back with Ensign====
Lacking an offer for a competitive drive in 1980, Regazzoni re-joined Ensign. His season came to an abrupt end only four races into the year. He crashed during the 1980 United States Grand Prix West, held at Long Beach, when the brake pedal of his Ensign failed at the end of a long, high-speed straight travelling at approximately 280 km/h. Ricardo Zunino&#x27;s retired Brabham was parked on the escape road. Regazzoni later recalled, &quot;I hit Zunino&#x27;s car, then bounced into the barrier. For about 10 minutes I lost consciousness. Then I remember terrible pain in my hips...&quot; The crash left Regazzoni paralyzed from the waist down, ending his competitive career. On recovery, Regazzoni sued the race organisers, claiming their safety procedures were sub-standard. However, the race organisers demonstrated that the procedures were adequate and won the case.

===After Formula One===
After this accident, Regazzoni became known for his activities in helping disabled people get equal opportunities in life and society. Despite his disability, Regazzoni was determined to live as full a life as possible. Regazzoni won back his racing licence and became one of the first disabled drivers to participate in high-level motorsports. Although his injuries made a Formula One return impossible, Regazzoni raced with some success in rally raids (e.g. the Dakar Rally) and sportscars (e.g. the 12 Hours of Sebring). These achievements paved the way for the wider acceptance of disabled persons in motoring and motorsports. Regazzoni&#x27;s last competitive race was in 1990, although he was occasionally offered test drives in racing cars during the 1990s. In 1994, he returned to the Long Beach Grand Prix (at that point an IndyCar race) to compete as a Pro in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race.
An account of his life can be found in his autobiography &quot;È questione di cuore&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s a Matter of Heart&quot;) published in the mid-1980s. His post-Formula One career occasionally saw him as a commentator for Swiss and Italian television. A second book about his experience at the Dakar Rally, &quot;E la corsa continua&quot; (&quot;And the race goes on&quot;) was published in 1988. He once commented to Niki Lauda, his ten years younger teammate, that &quot;if you drive as tensed up as you behave yourself towards women, you will never become great.&quot;

==Death==
On 15 December 2006, Regazzoni was killed when the Chrysler Voyager he was driving hit the rear of a lorry on the Italian A1 motorway, near Parma. Crash investigators estimate that he was travelling at approximately 100 km/h at the time and, despite early speculation, an autopsy specifically excluded a heart attack from being responsible for Regazzoni&#x27;s loss of control. His funeral was held on 23 December, in Lugano, and was attended by Niki Lauda, Arturo Merzario. Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, and Peter Sauber, among many luminaries from the Formula One world.

==Portrayal in media==
In the 2013 Ron Howard film &quot;Rush&quot;, which depicts the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the 1976 Formula One season, he is portrayed by Pierfrancesco Favino.

<doc id="1172365" wikidata="Q1020192" url="?curid=1172365" title="Uitenhage">
<text>Uitenhage ( ; ), officially renamed Kariega, is a South African town in the Eastern Cape Province. It is well known for the Volkswagen factory located there, which is the biggest car factory on the African continent. Along with the city of Port Elizabeth and the small town of Despatch, it forms the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality.

==History==

Uitenhage was founded on 25 April 1804 by &quot;landdrost&quot; (district magistrate) Jacob Glen Cuyler and named in honour of the Cape&#x27;s Commissioner-General Jacob Abraham Uitenhage de Mist by the Dutch Cape Colony governor, Jan Willem Janssens. Uitenhage formed part of the district of Graaff Reinet (shortly after its short-lived secession).

The Cape Colony received a degree of independence when &quot;Responsible Government&quot; was declared in 1872. In 1875, the Cape government of John Molteno took over the rudimentary Uitenhage railway site, incorporated it into the Cape Government Railways (CGR), and began construction of the lines connecting Uitenhage to Port Elizabeth and the Southern African interior. Two years later in 1877, Uitenhage was declared a municipality.

Nearly a hundred years later, as part of the Republic of South Africa, Uitenhage became a centre for resistance against apartheid. In 1985, police opened fire on a funeral procession in Uitenhage, killing a number of unarmed people, in an event that became notorious as an example of police oppression in South Africa under apartheid.

In 2001 it was incorporated with Port Elizabeth and Despatch into the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality. On 23 February 2021, Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa approved and gazetted the decision to rename Uitenhage to Kariega along with the neighbouring city of Port Elizabeth, which was renamed Gqeberha.

==Geography==

Kariega is situated on the banks of the Swartkops River, approximately 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) north-west of Gqeberha. Kariega, along with the city of Gqeberha, the neighbouring town of Despatch, the adjoining township of KwaNobuhle and surrounding areas, form the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality.

Kariega also lies at the start of the Mohair Route which leads along Route 75 towards Graaff-Reinet (the centre for mohair farming in South Africa), 228 kilometres to the northwest via Jansenville on Route 75.

==Industries==

Kariega is known for the large industries situated there. The largest of these industries are the Volkswagen of South Africa and Goodyear factories. An automotive supplier park, Alexander Park Industrial, has also been created directly next to the Volkswagen factory, thus allowing automotive component manufacturers to construct their manufacturing plants close by. Other industries of note are the food processing giant, Sovereign Foods, located in Kruisrivier industrial area and The Nelson Mandela Bay Logistics Park which hosts several other industries, including Fauricia. These industries are heavily interlinked.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===
The R75 highway, also known as Route 75, bypasses Kariega to the east, heading north–south from Graaff-Reinet to Gqeberha with interchanges at the M19, M6, R334 and Graaff-Reinet Road. The R334 connects Kariega with Coega to the east and with KwaNobuhle and the R102 (near Van Stadens Pass) to the south-west.

The town is also intersected by metropolitan routes such as the M6 (Caledon Street; Union Avenue) to Despatch in the east, the M10 (Durban Street; Algoa Road) to Bethelsdorp in the south-west, the M19 (Botha Street) to Despatch and the M22 (Marconi Street; Mel Brooks Avenue) to KwaNobuhle in the south. 

The main streets through the CBD, known as Uitenhage Central, include Cuyler Street, Caledon Street in Upper Central and Durban Street in Lower Central.

Drostdy — In 1804, the Cape colonial government assigned the shield of Jacob Abraham Uitenhage de Mist&#x27;s arms to the new Uitenhage drostdy. The arms were &quot;Sable, a cross moline Argent&quot;, i.e. a silver cross moline on a black shield. An anchor was placed behind the shield. The British authorities discontinued the drostdy seals in 1814, and replaced them with the royal coat of arms.

Municipality — In 1881, the Uitenhage municipal council adopted the De Mist arms, complete with a crest consisting of a cross moline issuing from a gold coronet. The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in September 1956 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in June 1994.

Divisional council — The Uitenhage divisional council (the local authority for the rural areas outside the town) assumed a coat of arms in 1968. The arms were granted by the provincial administrator in August 1968 and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in June 1972.

On the arms were stated: &quot;Or, a triple crowned tree Vert, the trunk entwined with the Batavian tricolour; on a chief wavy Sable a cross moline between dexter a pickaxe and hammer in saltire, handles downwards and sinister two scrolls in saltire, Argent.&quot; In layman&#x27;s terms, the design was a golden shield displaying, from top to bottom, a crossed pickaxe and hammer, a cross moline and two crossed scrolls on a black horizontal strip with a wavy edge, and a triple-crowned tree with a Batavian Republic flag wrapped around it.

The crest was an elephant, and the motto &quot;Per laborem ad honorem&quot;.

<text>Bugles are a corn snack produced by General Mills and Tom&#x27;s Snacks (under license from General Mills).
==History==
Bugles were developed by a food engineer, Verne E. Weiss of Plymouth, Minnesota. Bugles were test-marketed in 1965 and introduced nationally in early 1966 as one of several new General Mills snacks, including flower-shaped Daisys [&quot;sic&quot;]; wheel-shaped Pizza Spins; tube-shaped Whistles; cheddar cheese-flavored Buttons; and bow-shaped, popcorn-flavored Bows, all of which were discontinued in the 1970s.

From the time of their creation in the 1960s, General Mills&#x27; Bugles were manufactured at a plant in West Chicago, Illinois, until that plant&#x27;s closure in 2017. Bugles and the other snacks were also produced in Lancaster, Ohio, starting in 1981. It is now a Ralston Foods Plant part of Con-Agra. 

==Ingredients and varieties==
General Mills Bugles are fried in coconut oil, which contributes to their being significantly higher in medium-chain triglyceride saturated fat than similar snack foods, which are typically fried in soybean or other vegetable oils. Bugles contain no hydrogenated oils.

The ingredients of Original Bugles are degermed yellow corn meal, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking soda, and BHT. Ingredients for all variations of Bugles are listed on the General Mills website.

Bugles produced under the Tom&#x27;s Snacks label no longer use coconut oil, but rather &quot;vegetable oil (contains one or more of the following: canola oil, corn oil, or sunflower oil).&quot;

They have been available in the following flavors: Original, Nacho Cheese, Salt &amp; Vinegar, Sour Cream &amp; Onion, Ranch, Chili Cheese, Salsa, Smokin&#x27; BBQ, Churros, Southwest Ranch, Sweet and Salty Chocolate Peanut Butter, Sweet and Salty Caramel, Cheddar, Ketchup, Coriander, Cookies and Cream, Hot Buffalo, Shrimp, Jalapeño Cheddar, Hot &amp; Spicy, and Hot &amp; Spicy BBQ (exclusively manufactured by Tom&#x27;s). In addition to original flavors, the brand has also had crossover flavors like with Hidden Valley Ranch and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 

Bugles are so-named because of their &quot;horn&quot; or bugle shape.

==International sales==
As of November 2014, Bugles were sold as Bugles in the United States, Canada, China, Denmark, Iraq, The Netherlands, and several more countries in Central America and the Caribbean.

Bugles were discontinued in Canada in early 2010 due to a decrease in customer demand, but were soon brought back in November 2011 due to a renew in demand. On November 14, 2022, the official Bugles Twitter account confirmed that their products were again no longer available in Canada. In the United Kingdom, Bugles were available in the early 2000s and manufactured by Golden Wonder. They were discontinued after several years, but were brought back in 2016, and are now manufactured by Walkers.

<text>Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães (18 October 1836 – 22 January 1891) was a Brazilian military officer and political thinker. Primarily a positivist, influenced heavily by Auguste Comte, he was the founder of the positivist movement in Brazil (Sociedade Positivista do Brasil, &quot;Brazilian Positivist Society&quot;), and later this led to his republican views. He left the Brazilian Positivist Society because of internal disagreements, but remained an ardent pupil of Comte until the end of his life.

Benjamin Constant was born in Niterói. He had a difficult childhood and attempted suicide at the age of 12. He served in the Paraguayan War, and had a large family. He felt underpaid and unhappy as a soldier. An intellectual at heart, he was a great supporter of Comte&#x27;s Religion of Humanity.

His republican views led him to found the Clube Militar (or Military Club), with Deodoro da Fonseca, in May 1887. It was based in the Praia Vermelha Military School, and, shortly before his death, helped to organize a coup to overthrew Emperor Pedro II and establish a republic.

The Brazilian town of Benjamin Constant, Amazonas, near the Amazon River and the Peruvian border, was named after him.

He was considered &quot;the founder of the Republic&quot; in the Constitution of 1891, having died earlier the same year in Rio de Janeiro, aged 54.

<doc id="1172386" wikidata="Q863438" url="?curid=1172386" title="The Valley of Fear">
<text>The Valley of Fear is the fourth and final Sherlock Holmes novel by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle. It is loosely based on the Molly Maguires and Pinkerton agent James McParland. The story was first published in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; between September 1914 and May 1915. The first book edition was copyrighted in 1914, and it was first published by George H. Doran Company in New York on 27 February 1915, and illustrated by Arthur I. Keller.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes receives a cipher message from Fred Porlock, a pseudonymous agent of Professor Moriarty. Holmes deciphers the message as a warning of a nefarious plot against one Douglas, a country gentleman residing at Birlstone House. Some minutes later, Inspector MacDonald arrives at 221B Baker Street with news that Douglas was murdered the night before. MacDonald, Holmes, and Watson travel to Birlstone House to investigate. 

Birlstone House is surrounded by a shallow moat, which the murderer appears to have crossed as they fled the crime scene. After interviewing Cecil Barker, a frequent guest at Birlstone House, and the man who discovered the body, they agree that suicide is out of the question and that someone from outside the house committed the murder. Barker explains that Douglas married after arriving in England five years earlier. Barker believes a secret society of men pursued Douglas, and that he retreated to rural England out of fear for his life. Mrs. Douglas said her husband mentioned something called &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;. Holmes learns that the housekeeper heard a sound, as if of a door slamming, half an hour before the alarm; Holmes believes that this sound was the fatal shot. 

Local detective White Mason and Inspector MacDonald track a bicycle found on the grounds of the house to an American staying at a guest house. The American appears to be the murderer, but there is no sign of him. Holmes asks MacDonald to write to Barker, telling him that the police intend to search the moat the next day. That night, they lie in wait outside Birlstone Manor and see Barker fish the clothes of the missing American out of the moat. Barker refuses to explain the situation. At that moment, Douglas appears, alive and well. He hands Watson a written account called &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, which explains why he feared for his life. 

Douglas explains that he had spotted an enemy of his, Ted Baldwin, in the area and expected an attack. When Baldwin attempted to shoot Douglas in his study, Douglas grabbed the gun and, in the struggle, Baldwin was shot in the face. With Barker&#x27;s help, Douglas dressed the man in his clothes to confuse his enemies. He then hid himself in the old priest hole at Birlstone.

The main narrative pauses to explain Douglas&#x27; past in America. Douglas&#x27; real name was Birdy Edwards and he had been a Pinkerton detective in Chicago. Working for the Pinkertons, Edwards had travelled to Vermissa Valley to infiltrate a corrupt coal miner&#x27;s trade union, secretly a cover for a murderous gang. After Edwards brought the gang to justice, the criminals attempted to kill him. Hounded, Douglas ran to England, where he met and married his second wife. 

Holmes urges Douglas to leave England. Douglas takes this advice, but, shortly after, Holmes learns from Barker that Douglas was lost overboard on the ship to Africa. Holmes believes Moriarty was responsible for ending Douglas&#x27; life and he swears to bring Moriarty down.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; was first serialised in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; from September 1914 to May 1915. In the &quot;Strand&quot;, it was published with thirty-one illustrations by Frank Wiles. In the United States, the novel was serialized from September to November 1914 in Associated Sunday Magazine supplements to various newspapers around the country.

&quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; was first published in book form by George H. Doran Company in New York on 27 February 1915, after the serialisation was completed in the United States but before it had finished in the &quot;Strand&quot;. The first British book edition was published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. on 3 June 1915. Like the first Holmes novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; has two parts. The first part is titled &quot;The Tragedy of Birlstone&quot;, and the second is titled &quot;The Scowrers&quot;. The novel concludes with a short epilogue.

==Structure and themes==
Doyle crafted &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; as &quot;two parts and a coda&quot;. The novel has a number of major themes, including &quot;problems of ethical ambiguity&quot;, and attempts to comment seriously on terrorist activity as profiled by American union struggles. Critics have shown how the American union struggles deal with similar issues in the contemporary political situation in Ireland.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
Several films have adapted the book, among them:
* &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; (1916), a silent film starring H.A. Saintsbury and Booth Conway.
* &quot;The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1935), a British film starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Ian Fleming as Watson.
* &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace&quot; (1962), although intended to be an adaptation of &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, only minor elements of the story remained in the final film. 
* &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Valley of Fear&quot; (1983), an animated film starring Peter O&#x27;Toole as the voice of Holmes.

===Television===
*&quot;The Case of the Pennsylvania Gun&quot; (1954), an episode of the television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1954–1955) starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion-Crawford as Watson.
*&quot;La valle della paura&quot;, episodes 1-2-3 of the Italian television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1968) starring Nando Gazzolo as Holmes and Gianni Bonagura as Watson.

Despite the opening credits saying the episode is inspired by &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, there is actually no connection between the two.
*An episode of the puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; was loosely based on the story.
*&quot;The Final Problem&quot; (2017), the final episode of the 4th series of the BBC series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, makes a reference to Moriarty&#x27;s brother being a station master, albeit switching the original role of railway station master for a broadcast station master.

<text>Blanchard is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the southwestern limb. It lies to the south-southwest of the crater Arrhenius, and northwest of Pilâtre. Further to the south is the rugged terrain to the north of the walled plain Hausen.

This crater was named after French aeronaut Jean-Pierre Blanchard by the IAU in 1991. It was previously known as Arrhenius P.

The rim of Blanchard is worn and rounded, with a slight elongation along a northeastern direction. There is a break in the northwest rim. The two crater formations have nearly merged, and share the same interior floor. The remainder of the rim has several other breaks caused by impacts, particularly along the southeastern rim. The interior floor, although somewhat rough, does not contain a central peak or notable features.

This crater lies within the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

<doc id="1172394" wikidata="Q460138" url="?curid=1172394" title="The Dawn Patrol (1930 film)">
<text>The Dawn Patrol is a 1930 American pre-Code World War I film starring Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. It was directed by Howard Hawks, a former World War I flight instructor, who even flew in the film as a German pilot in an uncredited role. &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Story for John Monk Saunders, an American writer said to have been haunted by his inability to get into combat as a flyer with the U.S. Air Service. It was subsequently remade in 1938 with the same title, and the original was then renamed Flight Commander and released later as part of the Warner Bros. film catalog.
==Plot==
During World War I, the pilots of an RFC squadron deal with the stress of combat primarily through nightly bouts of heavy drinking. The two aces of the squadron&#x27;s &quot;A Flight&quot;, Courtney and Scott, have come to hate the commanding officer, Brand, blaming him for sending new recruits directly into combat in inferior aircraft.

Unknown to them, Brand has been arguing continually with higher command to allow practice time for the new pilots, but command is desperate to maintain air superiority and orders them into combat as soon as they arrive. Brand is so disliked by the two he cannot even easily join the men for the nightly partying, drinking alone and clearly breaking under the strain. The tension grows worse when an elite &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; squadron led by &quot;von Richter&quot; takes up position just across the front lines from them.

After losing several of the squadron&#x27;s veteran pilots, the ranks become increasingly made up of new recruits who have no chance against the German veterans. Von Richter issues a taunt that Courtney and Scott answer by attacking the Germans&#x27; airdrome in defiance of orders from Brand not to go up against them. Brand gets revenge when he is recalled to headquarters and Courtney is made squadron commander. Courtney quickly learns the misery that Brand endured when four patrols a day are ordered and his pleas not to send green men are ignored.

Scott and Courtney have a falling out when Scott&#x27;s younger brother, one of the new replacements, is immediately ordered on a mission. He is killed flying the dawn patrol. Brand returns with orders for what amounts to a suicide mission far behind enemy lines. Courtney is forbidden to fly the mission, so Scott angrily volunteers. Courtney gets him drunk and flies off in his stead. He shoots down von Richter returning from the successful mission, but is killed by another German pilot. Scott becomes squadron commander and reads orders to his new replacements.

==Cast==
* Richard Barthelmess as Dick Courtney
* Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Douglas Scott
* Neil Hamilton as Major Brand
* Frank McHugh as Flaherty
* Clyde Cook as Bott
* James Finlayson as Field Sergeant
* Gardner James as Ralph Hollister
* William Janney as Gordon Scott
* Edmund Breon as Lieutenant Phipps

==Production==
===Casting===
Although Ronald Colman was originally to be cast as the lead actor in &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, Barthelmess was offered by the studio. Paramount Publix Corp. loaned Actor Neil Hamilton and writer Seton I. Miller for the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in February 1930, with exteriors shot at the Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys, Newhall, and Sherwood Forrest in Southern California.

In the midst of production, the studio was sued by Howard Hughes, through the Caddo Company and the Gainsborough Corporation. The suit alleged that &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; plagiarized his &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930) production, also in production. The lawsuit resulted in &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; being rushed through post-production in order to be in theaters before Hughes&#x27; competing film. In late 1930, Warner Bros., owners of First National Pictures, won the suit. Another contentious issue later arose when both Howard Hawks and John Monk Saunders claimed ownership of the original idea behind the film. Hawks claimed he based the film on his own recollections while Saunders insisted that the screenplay was derived from the interviews of other veterans of World War I. In a deposition, Saunders said it was based on stories from pilots known by himself (during his time as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford) and by writer Irvin S. Cobb.|

===Aircraft===
Hawks attempted to create a realistic atmosphere, and assembled a variety of contemporary aircraft in a film squadron to shoot the flying scenes for &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;. He primarily used rebuilt Nieuport 28s as the aircraft for the British squadron, and Travel Air 4000s (reconfigured for films and popularly known as &quot;Wichita Fokkers&quot;) for German fighters. Neither was truly representative of the 1915 era that was portrayed. Other aircraft in his small fleet included Standard J-1s for shots of entire squadrons, some of which were blown up in explosions, and Waterman–Boeing C biplanes for German aircraft destroyed in crashes.

The scene in which Scott takes off with Courtney clinging to the wing switches to a shot of a Travel Air 4U Speedwing fitted with a round cowl over its Comet engine to resemble the Nieuports. Stunt pilots included Leo Nomis, Rupert Symes Macalister, Frank Tomick and Roy Wilson. Several Thomas-Morse S-4 aircraft were used in the 1930 film. The S-4 was an American built fighter aircraft that did not see combat in World War I. Plentiful in 1930, the S-4s were becoming rare by the time the 1938 film was produced, hence the re-use of aircraft sequences from the original film. Some in-flight scenes with principal actors were staged with aircraft hoisted up by wires to a height of 25 feet. Stage hands then rocked the aircraft to simulate flight, but when one of the wires snapped, on screen, Barthelmess appeared startled, unaware that an accident had occurred, and simply thought the swaying aircraft was part of the scene.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $1,061,000 domestically and $563,000 internationally, making it the studio&#x27;s third biggest hit of the year after &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot; and &quot;Sally&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Studio brass was extremely reluctant to back the release because Hawks had insisted on realistic dialogue that was at odds with the dramatic tone that executives had demanded. Nonetheless, &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; was an &quot;instant success&quot;, one of the studio&#x27;s most profitable films that year. Later critical reviews noted that the &quot;anti-war&quot; message was more prevalent in the original film, although due to the re-titling of &quot;Flight Commander&quot;, the film is often not as well known as its 1938 remake. The flying sequences, one of the hallmarks of the film, were vividly shot and were easily integrated into the later remake.

===Awards and honors===
Despite the controversy over the origin of the screenplay for &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, in 1931, Saunders won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay.

==Preservation status==
When the Warner Bros. film catalog was sold, &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; aired on television and from Associated Artists Productions, in its retitled form, as &quot;Flight Commander&quot;. The original title frames were discarded and the redrawn titles are on all known prints of the film.

==Remake==

The film was remade in 1938 as a vehicle for Errol Flynn, replacing Barthelmess in the lead, rather than reissuing the original as planned. David Niven took Fairbanks, Jr.&#x27;s role and Basil Rathbone was cast in the role played by Neil Hamilton. 
Much of the flying sequences from the 1930 film, with several of the close-ups of the fighter aircraft, were re-use for the 1938 movie, so as to save expense without having to search for or build new World War I era aircraft, but also due to the original sequences being expertly shot by Ernest Haller and Elmer Dyer. All of the film of the munitions depot explosions were also edited into the remake with no changes. When the 1938 version was released, the 1930 film was retitled &quot;Flight Commander&quot;, Saunder&#x27;s original title for the project, to differentiate it from its 1938 remake.

==In popular culture==
A novelization of the 1930 film, also titled &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, was written by Guy Fowler and published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1930. Warner Bros. also released two Looney Tunes cartoons parodying this film. Bosko appeared in &quot;Dumb Patrol&quot; (1931) and 33 years later, in 1964, Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam appeared in a second cartoon spoof that was also called &quot;Dumb Patrol&quot;.

<doc id="1172398" wikidata="Q1286957" url="?curid=1172398" title="Myslovitz">
<text>Myslovitz is a Polish rock band. The band take their name from their industrial hometown of Mysłowice in the Upper Silesia region of southern Poland.

==Band history==
Guitarist and vocalist Artur Rojek started the band in 1992 as &quot;The Freshmen&quot;, taking the initial name from the 1990 film &quot;The Freshman&quot;, starring Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick, indicating a fascination with cinema that would become a characteristic feature throughout the band&#x27;s career. In 1994 they changed their name to Myslovitz. The band&#x27;s early phase was characterised by a somewhat debonair punk attitude, as Rojek admits:
:&quot;I started Myslovitz in 1992. I was twenty then and I had no idea how to make good music. Surely, I was a big fan of a few British groups (Ride, Stone Roses, My Bloody Valentine, Housemartins) but I couldn&#x27;t play the guitar at all. After several months of rehearsals […] I decided that I should cover the holes in my musical education by […] chaos (the bigger the better).&quot; 

Even so, they soon caught the media&#x27;s attention, winning several important competitions for young musicians. This enabled them to make their first professional recordings in the studio of Radio Lodz. In 1994, Myslovitz were signed by MJM Music Pl and recorded their self-titled debut album with British producer Ian Harris, who had previously worked for, amongst others, Joy Division, New Order, and The Exploited. Upon its release in 1995, the album received euphoric reviews and was declared &quot;Debut of the Year&quot; by several music magazines. Some critics compared it to Oasis, who were at the peak of their popularity at that time.

In 1996, Myslovitz were joined by a third guitarist and keyboarder, Przemek Myszor, and released the second album &quot;Sun Machine&quot; on Sony Music Polska. The album spawned two somewhat beatlesque airplay hits - &quot;Z twarzą Marilyn Monroe&quot; (&quot;With a Face Like…&quot;) and &quot;Peggy Brown&quot;, the latter being a cover version of a fellow Mysłowice rock band, with lyrics originally by the Irish &quot;national bard&quot; Turlough O&#x27;Carolan (in a translation by the Polish lyricist and translator Ernest Bryll).

The following year, the third album &quot;Z rozmyślań przy śniadaniu&quot; (&quot;From meditations over breakfast&quot;) was released, displaying a tendency towards a more &quot;polished&quot; sound and more introspective lyrics. Also, Myslovitz&#x27;s now typical fascination with cinema began to take centre stage with numerous allusions and hints in the lyrics and track titles, and a certain &quot;cinematic&quot; atmosphere in the music itself.

The band&#x27;s interest in cinema also showed in their contributions to soundtracks. In 1998, they recorded the unconventional track &quot;To nie był film&quot; (&quot;That was no film&quot;) for the Polish movie &quot;Młode wilki ½&quot; (&quot;Young Wolves ½&quot;). The lyrics referred to a wave of violent crimes committed by juvenile delinquents, which was controversially discussed in Polish mass media in the mid-1990s. The explicit depiction of violence in the lyrics and the accompanying video clip (which later won a Fryderyk award as &quot;Video of the Year&quot;) caused further controversy and led Polish broadcasting networks to boycott both the song and the clip.

Also in 1998, Myslovitz had their first appearances abroad with shows in Sweden, Germany, and the United States.

The final breakthrough for the band came in 1999 with their fourth album entitled &quot;Miłość w czasach popkultury&quot; (&quot;Love in The Time of Pop Culture&quot;), which went platinum (i.e. 150,000 copies sold) soon and has by now achieved &quot;double platinum&quot; status in Poland. The single &quot;Długość dzwięku samotności&quot; (&quot;[The Length of the] Sound of Solitude&quot;) became the biggest hit for the band so far.

In 2000 Myslovitz again contributed to soundtracks, writing and recording the song &quot;Polowanie na wielbłąda&quot; (&quot;Camel Hunting&quot;) for the movie &quot;The Big Animal&quot; (&quot;Duże zwierzę&quot;) by the legendary Polish actor and director Jerzy Stuhr, and the single plus another two (previously unreleased) tracks to director Waldemar Szarek&#x27;s movie &quot;That&#x27;s Us&quot; (&quot;To my&quot;). In 2003 Myslovitz continued their cooperation with Stuhr, creating not only the title song for his movie &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Weather&quot;, but also appearing in walk-on roles - as neophyte monks.

In 2002, the follow-up to &quot;Miłość…&quot;, entitled &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot; appeared; the title being an allusion to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s classic screen version of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Strikingly, the melancholic elements took over almost completely, with both music and (sometimes sarcastic) lyrics creating an overall downcast mood. Nonetheless, the album sold even more copies than its predecessor had in the same amount of time, with the singles &quot;Acidland&quot; and &quot;Sprzedawcy marzeń&quot; (&quot;Dreamsellers&quot;) repeating the success of &quot;Długość…&quot; three years earlier.

The reason for the new material&#x27;s popularity, as some critics surmised, was that its atmosphere closely conformed to a presumed resignative-recessive mood within Polish society at large - which guitarist Przemek Myszor seemed to confirm in an interview for the &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot;: &quot;&quot;For us, the Korova Milky Bar&quot; [from Kubrick&#x27;s &#x27;A Clockwork Orange&#x27;] &quot;is a place where something different may happen to your mind. It&#x27;s a place like today&#x27;s Poland. You know, Poland is a place where very strange things happen to your mind. It&#x27;s a country full of crisis and everything around you is very sad, very dark, very fucked. There is an economic crisis here. People don&#x27;t have money, politics are fucked. The lyrics on our record are sad because of this. We sing a lot about being in a strange state of mind&quot; .&quot;

With &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot;, Myslovitz appeared at several festivals throughout Europe, including the big, traditional German festival for Alternative acts (&quot;Bizarre&quot;) and the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival. Also, they supported Iggy Pop and the Simple Minds on their European tours that year. Also, they received an MTV Europe Music Awards in Barcelona for &quot;Best Polish Act&quot;, having been nominated twice in previous years.

In November 2002 Myslovitz signed a new contract with EMI&#x27;s Polish outlet Pomaton. The first album to be released on the new label was an English-language re-recording of &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot;, which was released in 27 countries (including Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Spain, Russia, Turkey and South Africa). In addition to the &quot;Korova…&quot; material, this version also included English versions of older tracks. 
&quot;Długość dzwięku samotności&quot; now became a single as &quot;The Sound of Solitude&quot;&#x27; (an earlier English version, somewhat awkwardly but more correctly entitled &quot;The Length of The Solitude Sound&quot;, had been a Polish b-side). A video clip for this song was directed Janusz Kamiński, the Polish Hollywood cinematographer who had won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography with &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and had declined an offer from Martin Scorsese in order to work with Myslovitz. Kaminski declares himself a &quot;fan&quot; of Myslovitz, saying &quot;&quot;I only work for Spielberg and Myslovitz […] Money is not a factor in this. What one doesn&#x27;t do for one&#x27;s idols!&quot; &quot; The clip got frequent plays on MTV Europe and the album received positive reviews in the European music press, particularly in Germany. However, radio airplay was sporadic and largely limited to Alternative programmes (such as John Peel in the UK), as a consequence, Myslovitz so far failed to enter the upper reaches of the charts outside Poland.

Also in 2003, Myslovitz performed with Travis and Skin (of Skunk Anansie fame) on &quot;The Road to Edinburgh&quot;, where they received another MTV Europe Music Award for &quot;Best Polish Act&quot;.

The same year, Sony Music domestically released an obligatory end-of-contract compilation album, entitled &quot;The Best of&quot;. The lead single &quot;Kraków&quot; was an older song re-recorded with 1970s Polish folk rock stars Marek Grechuta and Anawa.

In the summer of 2004 Myslovitz were touring Europe again, starting with a concert for the German public radio and television broadcaster WDR on the eve of EU enlargement. Apart from headlining smaller venues and playing festival slots (including the largest Swiss open-air event in St. Gallen, they again opened for Iggy Pop &amp; The Stooges on their European dates, as well as for The Corrs in the UK and mainland Europe.

In December 2004, EMI released Myslovitz&#x27;s most recent album entitled &quot;Skalary, mieczyki, neonki&quot; (&quot;Angelfish, swordtails, neon tetras&quot;) - an out-of-schedule release with outtakes from the &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot; recording sessions; longform, psychedelic-experimental and downbeat instrumental soundscapes took center stage. &quot;Skalary…&quot; earned Myslovitz comparisons to Radiohead and Pink Floyd.

At the time, the band had finished recording of their new album &quot;Happiness Is Easy&quot;; it was released in May 2006.

Myslovitz&#x27;s success arguably contributed to a revitalisation of the Polish alternative rock scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which spawned bands such as &quot;eM&quot;, &quot;Kombajn do zbierania kur po wioskach&quot;, and &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;.

In April 2012, frontman and co-founder Artur Rojek left the band after twenty years to pursue a solo career and continue work as creative director for the annual OFF Festival. Rojek was replaced by singer Michał Kowalonek, who left the band in 2018 (exactly six years to the day of Rojek&#x27;s departure ).

==Myslovitz and Mysłowice==
Myslovitz follow the tradition of 1970s American rock acts who took their names from their places of origin, such as Chicago or Boston. When choosing their name, the band seemed to be inspired by an ambiguous relationship towards their hometown which they felt to be rather provincial. In a review of &quot;The Best of…&quot;, the liberal Catholic weekly &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; stated that &quot;coming from Mysłowice, the band entered the new, wonderful world of show business with a small-town complex&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; (see above), Guitarist Przemek Myszor called Mysłowice &quot;&quot;depressing&quot; […] like all small towns are. In Poland there are few big towns. And by big town I mean where there is culture. You know, towns that have big clubs. We still live in Mysłowice, but this is a city to die in, not to live. Our region of Poland, in the south, is very industrial, coal mining, hard industry&quot;&quot; .
For statements like these, Myslovitz were sometimes chided for fouling their own nest; paradoxically, however, they even helped to sanitize the city&#x27;s image. Says the music journalist Leszek Gnoiński (author of the &quot;standard work&quot; &quot;Encyklopedia Polskiego Rocka&quot;): &quot;Mysłowice is a city of some 100,000 people. Until the early 90s, it was known, at best, for its coalmines - until these five guys with guitars turned the mining town into a place that could be located on any map of Poland.&quot; Myslovitz&#x27;s impact was one factor which stimulated the development of a local music scene. By now, with bands such as &quot;Negatyw&quot; and &quot;Supermusic&quot;, a lively Alternative rock and hip hop culture is flourishing in Mysłowice. Far away from Warsaw as the centre of the commercial Polish entertainment industry, it even benefits from its image as being peripheral, obscure, and non-commercial - not totally unlike the British Madchester phenomenon in the 1980s and early 1990s.

==Awards==
*Apart from numerous accolades awarded by Polish music magazines and radio stations, Myslovitz received the weekly &quot;Polityka&quot;&#x27;s prestigious &quot;Paszport&quot; in the category &quot;Pop/Rock/Entertainment&quot; in 1999; in 2000 the Polish &quot;Playboy&quot; declared &quot;Długość Dzwięku Samotności&quot; and Myslovitz &quot;Song of The Year&quot; and &quot;Band of The Year&quot; respectively, whereas the Polish issue of &quot;Elle&quot; declared them the &quot;most stylish stars in music&quot;.
*Myslovitz were frequently nominated for Fryderyks (the Polish equivalent of the BRIT Award or the Grammy) in various categories. In total, they received seven Fryderyk awards - in 1998 for &quot;Music Video of The Year&quot; (for &quot;To nie był film&quot;/&quot;It wasn&#x27;t a movie&quot; - see above), in 1999 for &quot;Band of The Year&quot; and &quot;Rock Album of The Year&quot; (for &quot;Długość Dzwięku Samotności&quot;/&quot;Length of the sound of solitude&quot;), in 2000 for &quot;Song of The Year&quot; (for &quot;Chłopcy&quot;/&quot;(Town) Boys&quot;) and &quot;Video of The Year&quot; (for &quot;Dla Ciebie&quot;/&quot;For You&quot;), and in 2003 for &quot;Album of The Year (for &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot;).
*After two nominations in previous years, Myslovitz were declared &quot;Best Polish Act&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2002 and again in 2003.
*On January 23, 2005, as part of the European Commission&#x27;s &quot;Border Breakers&quot; award ceremony held at MIDEM 2005 in Cannes, Myslovitz received the &quot;European Breakthrough&quot; award for &quot;Korova Milky Bar&quot; as the best-selling album out of the ten new EU member states.

==Discography==
===Studio albums===
*The official album charts of Poland did not begin until late 2000, meaning chart positions for albums released before then, may not reflect their true popularity. Their debut album charted in 2010, 15 years after its release.

<doc id="1172401" wikidata="Q3492034" url="?curid=1172401" title="List of ZX Spectrum clones">
<text>The following is a list of clones of Sinclair Research&#x27;s ZX Spectrum home computer. This list includes both official clones (from Timex Corporation) and many unofficial clones, most of which were produced in Eastern Bloc countries. The list does not include computers which require additional hardware or software to become ZX-compatible. 
Many software emulators can fully or partially emulate some clones as well.

== Official ==
The only official clones of the Spectrum were made by Timex. There were three models developed, only two of which were released:

=== Timex Sinclair 2068 ===

The Timex Sinclair 2068 or T/S 2068 (also known as TC 2068 or UK 2086) was a significantly more sophisticated machine than the original Spectrum. The most notable changes were the addition of a cartridge port, an AY-3-8912 sound chip, and an improved ULA giving access to better graphics modes. The T/S 2068 was produced for consumers in the United States, while very similar machines were marketed in Portugal and Poland as the Timex Computer 2068 (TC 2068) and Unipolbrit Komputer 2086 (UK 2086) respectively. A small number of TC 2068s were also sold in Poland.

=== Timex Computer 2048 ===

The Timex Computer 2048 or TC 2048 was a similar machine to the Spectrum 48K, but with the improved ULA from the TC 2068 (allowing access to the improved graphics modes), Kempston joystick port, and composite video output. Marketed only in Portugal and Poland.
=== Timex Sinclair 2048 ===

The Timex Sinclair 2048 or T/S 2048 was a never-released variant of the T/S 2068 with 16 KB of RAM.

=== Inves Spectrum + ===
A clone of the ZX Spectrum+ developed by Investrónica in Spain in 1986, the Inves Spectrum + was based on the work developed by the company on the ZX Spectrum 128. Released just after Amstrad bought Sinclair Research Ltd, it looked much like a regular ZX Spectrum+, but all the internal components were redesigned. As the ROM was also modified, it has compatibility problems with some games – notably Bombjack, Commando, and Top Gun. A Kempston joystick port was fitted on the rear of the machine.

Due to Invéstronica being the distributor of Sinclair&#x27;s products in Spain, and because Amstrad already had its own exclusive distributor in Spain (Indescomp, later bought by Amstrad itself), Amstrad sued Investrónica in 1987 to cease sales of the computer. The court agreed with Amstrad, but the decision was not issued until 1991, when the computer was discontinued, as the 8-bit computer market in Spain was succeeded by 16-bit computers.

===Decibels dB Spectrum+===
The Decibels dB Spectrum+ was an official clone of the ZX Spectrum+ for the Indian market, introduced in 1988 by Decibels Electronics Limited, selling over 50000 units and achieving an 80% market share. 
== Unofficial ==

=== British ===

==== Harlequin ====
A British clone of the 48K ZX Spectrum, Harlequin was designed and developed by Chris Smith, to aid the reverse engineering of the ZX Spectrum custom ULA chip, and its research documentation. Completed in 2008, it is the first 100% timing compatible clone. Until 2012/13 the Harlequin existed only as a breadboard prototype, but recently, José Leandro Martínez, Ingo Truppel, and others produced a limited number of PCB versions as an exact board replacement for an actual ZX Spectrum.

===Czech &amp; Czechoslovak ===

==== Bobo64 ====
The Bobo64 was an advanced Czech computer compatible with the ZX Spectrum, developed by Václav Daněček between 1986 and 1987. It has many enhancements over the original ZX Spectrum, including 256×256 graphics with attributes per 8 x 1 pixels, and 512 x 256 graphics. Unlike other Czechoslovak home-made ZX Spectrum clones, the Bobo64 gained some popularity, and was built by dozens of enthusiasts.

==== Didaktik series ====

The Didaktik was a series of home computers produced by Didaktik in Skalica, in the former Czechoslovakia.

The first model compatible with the ZX Spectrum was the Didaktik Gama, based on the U880 or Zilog Z80 processors and the original ULA chip. It was produced in three variants between 1987 and 1989. The Gama has a built-in 8255 chip (used for the Kempston joystick, and also as a printer port) and 80 KB RAM, adding an alternative memory bank from the address 32768 to 65535.

The Gama was followed by the cheaper Didaktik M (first variant released in 1990; the second in 1991). The model M had a modernised case, Sinclair and Kempston Joystick ports, and a keyboard with cursors and reset key. The design, however, was of lower quality than the Gama. Its screen aspect ratio and display timing are different from the original ZX Spectrum because the M uses a different ULA chip, compatible with the Belarusian clone Baltik. It ran at 4 MHz. The final model was the Didaktik Kompakt (1991) which integrated all previous M hardware with a 3.5″ floppy disk drive.

Unlike previous versions, the Didaktik 192K was an amateur project, partly combining the hardware of the Didaktik Gama and the ZX Spectrum 128K.

==== Krišpín ====
The Krišpín was a czechoslovakian clone of the ZX Spectrum, developed by František Kubiš at 1984, a student of EF SVŠT (Electrotechnical Faculty of Slovak Technical University) Bratislava. The ULA was designed using discrete 74xx ICs, which resulted in the screen part of RAM being synchronised perfectly, without CPU blocking. 

==== MISTRUM ==== 
Another Czechoslovakian clone of the 48K ZX Spectrum, the MISTRUM, was supplied in kit form. The ROM was modified to include letters with Czech diacritic marks. An article on how to build a Mistrum was published in the Czechoslovak amateur radio magazine &quot;Amatérské Radio&quot; 1/89.
==== Nucleon ====
The Nucleon was a Czech clone of the Pentagon 512K, made by CSS Electronics.

==== Sparrow 48K ====
The Sparrow 48K is the first modern clone of the ZX Spectrum designed to replace the original motherboard in standard and Spectrum+ case. Production commenced in 2013. In addition to the use of the original ULA chip, this clone was heavily modernised, replacing part of the larger glue logic with one CPLD chip, the entire main memory with one SRAM chip, and all 8 video memory chips with a second SRAM. The TV modulator has been dropped in favour of a video signal, and the PSU was changed and improved. The Sparrow also offers a larger ROM, which can be increased by 16 KB via a switch or a jumper. The successor is the Sparrow SX, with software ROM switching and RTC.

==== HT 3080C ====
The HT 3080C was a Hungarian ZX Spectrum clone made by Híradástechnikai Szövetkezet (Telecommunication Technology Cooperative), and released in 1986. It was the third computer from the company. The two first computers (HT 1080Z and HT 2080Z) were clones of the TRS-80, and were unsuccessful because of the poor graphics features and high price. They were both school computers.

In 1986, Hungarian school computers were required to meet two criteria: produce high resolution graphics, and support letters with Hungarian diacritic marks. The HT 3080C was produced to satisfy both these criteria, and was also designed to be compatible with the previous HT machines, with the option of switching between TRS-80 and ZX Spectrum mode. It had a graphics resolution of 256 x 192 (the ZX Spectrum standard) and an AY-chip for sound (for compatibility with previous HT machines).

It featured a 32 KB ROM, 64 KB RAM, and (uniquely) a Commodore serial port which enabled the connection of peripherals for the C64 (e.g. the 1541 floppy disk drive).

==== Elwro 800 Junior ====

The Elwro 800 Junior was Polish clone of the ZX Spectrum produced by ELWRO for use in schools. It ran a special version of CP/M called CP/J. The computer had a full size keyboard, and even a paper/document holder. The reason for the latter is that the machine shares the same case as the Elwirka electronic keyboard, which had provisions for holding sheet music. Peripherals were attached to the computer using a mix of DIN and D-subminiature connectors.

ELWRO had developed a local area network protocol called JUNET (JUnior NETwork) for use with the machines which operated on a basis not unlike MIDI, in which one DIN cable was used to receive data, and another to send it. In this manner, the teacher was able to monitor what all the students in the class were doing on their computers.

The updated Elwro 804 Junior PC had an internal 3.5″ disk drive.

===Portuguese===

==== IODO ====

The IODO (Issue One Dot One) was created in Portugal by Consultório da Paula (now PSiTech) in 09/01/2019. It is a clone of the original 16 KB ZX Spectrum issue one, and it&#x27;s on display on LOAD ZX museum in Cantanhede, Portugal.

==== CIP series ====
The CIP are Romanian ZX Spectrum clones made by Intreprinderea Electronica. CIP stands for Calculator pentru Instruire Personala (&quot;Computer for Personal Education&quot;). The ROM is original Sinclair, but has been modified to display &#x27;BASIC S&#x27; in place of the standard Sinclair copyright message. Only one set of 8 x 1-bit 64 KB RAM modules is present.

The initial version, CIP-02, had a low quality 2 KB EEPROM with a propensity for fast data loss, and BASIC had to be loaded from tape. CIP-03 was a version of the EEPROM designed to work with the 3 data densities on the tape at speeds up to 3 times higher than the original, and the 2K ROM was also capable of loading and saving at those speeds, using the whole 64K as storage. The top data density was often hit and miss; very good magnetic tape had to be used, and a special monophonic cassette recorder could be bought separately for best results. Produced from 1988 to 1993 it was a common clone in Romania, with about 15,000 units produced. CIP-04 was a ZX Spectrum +3 clone with a built-in floppy disk drive and 256 KB RAM.
==== Felix HC series ====
Felix HC are a series of ZX Spectrum clones manufactured in Romania from 1985 to 1994 by ICE Felix. The HC designation stands for Home Computer, and for the first four models in the series, the number indicates the year of first manufacture. Models in the series were: HC 85, HC 88, HC 90, HC 91, HC91+ (HC128), HC 2000 and HC386.

The earliest version (HC 85) closely resembled the Spectrum, with a built-in BASIC interpreter, Z80A processor, 48 KB RAM, tape, and TV interfaces. It was used in schools/universities, and as a personal computer.

An optional Interface 1 expansion was available for the HC 85, HC 90, and HC 91. It was functionally similar to the ZX Interface 1, but instead of Microdrives it supported single-density or double-density floppy disks.

The HC 90 had a redesigned circuit board supporting fewer, larger memory chips; it was functionally equivalent to the HC 85.

The HC 91 had a modified keyboard with 50 keys instead of 40. It had 64 KB RAM, and extra circuitry which provided CP/M support if the Interface 1 expansion was also present.

The HC 2000 (manufactured from 1992 to 1994) had a built-in 3.5-inch 720 KB floppy disk drive, and 64 KB RAM. It could be used both as a Spectrum clone with added disk functionality (only 48 KB RAM available) or in CP/M mode, giving access to the full 64 KB memory. Essentially, it consolidated the HC 91, Interface 1, and floppy disk drive into a single case.

The last model to be made in the Z80 line was the HC91+. It was a ZX Spectrum 128K clone in a HC91 case and keyboard, and had some compatibility problems. For the first time, the AY-8910 sound chip was offered as an add-on service, and was soldered on the board by factory technicians. Demoscene demos had problems running multi-colour effects, and displaying sound VU meter-like effects, through lack of data in the AY chip.

It is the first (and only, as of 2022) clone with 100% hardware and display timings aligned with a digital video and sound output (incl. HDMI). It uses a genuine (faster) Z80 CPU switchable from 3.5 MHz up to 20 MHz, which can be overclocked to 30 MHz, or changed for a T80 core at higher speed. Other logic circuitry is integrated in the Alchitry AU and AU+ FPGA modules, attachable to the eLeMeNt&#x27;s motherboard.

The eLeMeNt ZX combines 48K, 128K, +2, +2A, and many Russian memory models, including four Pentagon (computer) and several other Russian models, and the most popular interfaces, such as: K-Mouse; TurboSound FM; Sound Interface Device (SID); enhanced Covox and Soundrive; DivMMC; Z-Controller; Timex and advanced HiRes 512×192 with attributes and planar-based and chunky HGFX graphics modes; ULA+ and indexed true colour palettes; USB mouse and keyboard; 2 interchangeable SD card slots; 3 joystick slots, supporting 2-button Kempston and 8-button Sega controllers; USB serial connection with PC through a standard USB-A cable. The eLeMeNt features the original ZX bus (1x external, 2x internal), a USB-A serial connection and a rich internal pinout expansion for other modern peripherals.

The eLeMeNt has 2 MB of RAM, which is upgradeable to 4 MB. The ROM system supports 16K to 64 KB ROMs, plus SetUp (BIOS) ROM, Rescue ROM, and the latest version of the modern FAT and POSIX-API based filesystem: esxDOS.

==== Humble 48 ====
A spanish clone, introduced in 2017.

==== Karabas 128, Pro ====
The Karabas-128 is a ZX Spectrum 128k clone developed by Andy Karpov, based on CPLD Altera EPM7128STC100. The Karabas Pro is FPGA based clone with FDD and HDD controllers.

==== N-Go ====
A clone of the ZX Spectrum Next.

==== SAM Coupé ====

SAM Coupé was an advanced 8-bit computer from 1989, compatible with the ZX Spectrum 48K. The design of the disk-drive hardware was based on the MG PlusD interface. SAM BASIC was very similar to the BetaBasic, and was developed by the same author. The Coupé was considered the successor to the ZX Spectrum in the late &#x27;80s.

==== Sizif ====
The Sizif is a ZX Spectrum CPLD-based clone for rubber case, developed by Eugene Lozovoy.

==== Speccy 2010 ====
The Speccy2010 is FPGA development board by Martin Bórik, built for the implementation of various gaming computers, originally focused on ZX Spectrum and its clones.

==== Sprinter ====
==== Superfo (ZX mini, ZX Max, ZX Spider, ZX Nuvo) ====
These are ZX Spectrum clones by Don &quot;Superfo&quot;.

==== ZX Badaloc ====
ZX Badaloc was the very first CPLD/FPGA advanced ZX Spectrum clone.

==== ZX-Evolution (Ts-Conf and Baseconf) ====
A Spectrum-compatible computer with improved hardware specifications and using modern peripherals. In addition to the basic core (Baseconf), it also has extended core named TS-Conf, which supports sprites, other extended video modes and have original memory manager.

==== ZX Prism ====
The ZX Prism is a proposal for a modern ZX Spectrum clone.

==== ZX-Uno(+) ====
The ZX-Uno is based on a FPGA board focused on replicating ZX Spectrum computer models. It has a similar size to the Raspberry Pi and fit into a RasPi case.

=== Multi-platform computers with ZX-Spectrum core ===

==== DivGMX ====
A ZX Spectrum interface that can also work as a standalone computer.

==== ReVerSE ====
Several projects by mvvproject.

==== ZX DOS+ ====
ZX DOS is the continuation of the ZX-Uno project. A 1 MB version of the ZXDOS was released in 2020 that is compatible with the SpecNext core.

<text>WPXH-TV (channel 44) is a television station licensed to Hoover, Alabama, United States, serving the Birmingham area as an affiliate of Ion Television. The station is owned by Inyo Broadcast Holdings, and maintains offices on Golden Crest Drive in Birmingham and a transmitter atop Red Mountain, near the city&#x27;s southern edge.

==History==
===As a satellite of WTTO and WDBB===
The station traces its creation to issues involving independent station WDBB (channel 17) in Tuscaloosa, which was looking to increase its profile in central Alabama. When that station signed on in October 1984, at a time when cable television still did not have much penetration in the region, WDBB faced problems in trying to improve its coverage throughout the central part of the state, as its signal was nowhere near strong enough to cover the northern half of the market, particularly areas to the northeast of Birmingham proper. Although WDBB&#x27;s founding owner, Dubose Broadcasting, invested heavily in the station and acquired a strong inventory of syndicated programming, the signal&#x27;s inability to reach most of central Alabama put WDBB at a severe disadvantage against the area&#x27;s other major independent, WTTO (channel 21) in Birmingham, which had early on established itself as one of the strongest independent stations in the Deep South and the United States as a whole.

DuBose found a solution when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded the company a construction permit to launch a television station in Gadsden on UHF channel 44. That station signed on in April 1986 as WNAL-TV, originally operating as a full-time satellite station for the northern half of the market—specifically, areas to the east of downtown Birmingham—that could not receive the WDBB signal. Shortly before WNAL signed on, DuBose reached an agreement with the Fox Broadcasting Company to become the network&#x27;s charter affiliate for central Alabama after WTTO turned down an offer to join the network. WDBB further strengthened its hand by using its forthcoming status as a network affiliate to make a concerted effort to improve its reach in Birmingham by applying to transfer its city of license to Bessemer, southwest of Birmingham, which allowed it to build a new transmitter tower located closer to Birmingham that would provide a much stronger signal in the western portion of the city.

WDBB and WNAL became a Fox charter affiliate when the network officially launched on October 9, 1986. As was the case with other Fox stations during the network&#x27;s early years, channels 17 and 44 continued to program as &quot;de facto&quot; independent stations as the late-night talk show &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; was the network&#x27;s only program initially; when Fox debuted its prime time schedule in April 1987, the network only carried evening programming on weekends, and would not carry seven nights a week of programming until June 1993. Until Fox began airing programming on a nightly basis, WDBB and WNAL aired movies (and later, syndicated programs) at 7 p.m. on nights when the network was not scheduled to air any programming.

Despite covering roughly half of central Alabama over-the-air and the two stations maintaining a relatively strong program lineup, the signal of WDBB did not provide better than Grade B coverage (at best) within Birmingham proper. Due to the eastward location of its transmitter tower, WNAL&#x27;s signal did not penetrate well into Birmingham either, only reaching as far west as extreme eastern Jefferson County. In addition, several major cable providers in the Birmingham market, including in Jefferson and Shelby counties, refused to carry the station for this reason. Ultimately, WDBB/WNAL was not profitable. After all efforts to increase the stations&#x27; cable coverage failed, Fox signed an agreement to make WTTO its new Birmingham affiliate and moved its programming to channel 21 in January 1991.

Soon afterward, DuBose reached an agreement with Abry Communications in which WDBB and WNAL would convert into semi-satellites of WTTO and begin simulcasting its programming for the vast majority of their broadcast day, with separate syndicated programming airing during the three hours that the stations continued to program themselves. As part of the deal, WDBB/WNAL merged its stronger inventory of programming onto WTTO&#x27;s schedule, with the local rights to some classic sitcoms on its schedule that it could not retain or move elsewhere on the schedule being sold to WABM (channel 68) in Birmingham, which converted into a general entertainment independent around the same time the WTTO/WDBB/WNAL simulcasting arrangement went into place. The station subsequently began identifying as &quot;Fox 21&quot;, using the channel allocation of WTTO as a universal brand for it and its repeaters. The combination of WTTO, WDBB and WNAL provided a strong combined signal throughout the central third of Alabama that was comparable to those of ABC affiliate WBRC-TV (channel 6) and NBC affiliate WVTM-TV (channel 13). In 1993, Abry had purchased WDBB and WNAL outright and converted both stations into full-time satellite stations of WTTO, resulting in the removal of local programming on the former two stations.

By 1994, the WTTO/WDBB/WNAL combination had become one of the highest-rated Fox affiliates in the country, and managed to overtake then-underperforming CBS affiliate WBMG (channel 42, now WIAT) as the third-highest-rated television station in central Alabama. Late that year, both WDBB and WNAL began airing separate programming during the daytime and late evening hours, consisting of syndicated sitcoms, drama and animated series that WTTO did not hold the rights to broadcast as well as local newscasts. That same year, the Hunt Valley, Maryland–based Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired WTTO, WDBB and WNAL when it merged with Abry Communications, which also assumed a local marketing agreement with WABM (a deal signed the previous year when WABM was sold to a locally based group). In 1995, WNAL was purchased by Fant Broadcasting, but continued to simulcast WTTO&#x27;s programming through a time brokerage agreement.

===As a CBS affiliate===
In March 1994, Great American Communications agreed to sell WBRC to New World Communications, as part of a deal that also involved three of the former group&#x27;s other television stations (WDAF-TV in Kansas City, KSAZ-TV in Phoenix and WGHP in High Point, North Carolina). Subsequently, three weeks later, New World agreed to purchase WVTM and three other stations (KTVI in St. Louis, KDFW in Dallas, and KTBC in Austin, Texas) from Argyle Television Holdings. New World was now faced with the prospect of having to divest as many as three of the acquired stations as the FCC forbade broadcasting companies from owning two commercial television stations in the same market, and restricted them from owning more than twelve stations nationwide (the concurrent acquisitions of the Argyle and Citicasters stations put New World three stations over the national television ownership cap).

On May 23, 1994, six months after the network signed a deal with the National Football League (NFL) to acquire the rights to the National Football Conference television package, New World signed an affiliation agreement with Fox to switch twelve of its television stations—six that New World had already owned and eight that the company was in the process of acquiring through the Argyle and Citicasters deals, including WBRC—to the network, once their existing affiliation contracts with CBS, NBC or ABC expired. Although WTTO was one of Fox&#x27;s strongest affiliates at the time, the network saw the opportunity to affiliate with WBRC because it had been the highest-rated station in the Birmingham market for most of its history.

Seeing a chance to solve its ownership conflicts in Birmingham, New World reached an agreement with Citicasters to sell WBRC (as well as WGHP) directly to the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station group, Fox Television Stations, in return for $130 million in promissory notes; New World would also establish an outside trust company that would operate channel 6 until the sale was completed.

Even though the sale would be finalized on July 24, 1995, Fox Television Stations could not convert WBRC into a Fox owned-and-operated station in the short term as the station&#x27;s affiliation agreement with ABC was not set to expire until August 31, 1996. While this put WBRC in the rare position of being owned by the O&amp;O group of one network while still affiliated with another, it also gave ABC enough time to find a replacement affiliate in Birmingham; this was also instrumental in causing a complicated series of affiliation changes involving six central Alabama stations. In November 1995, as part of its $20 million purchase of CBS affiliate WCFT-TV (channel 33, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WSES) in Tuscaloosa from Federal Broadcasting, Allbritton Communications signed a deal with Fant Broadcasting to assume operational responsibilities and provide programming to WNAL-TV under a local marketing agreement. Allbritton backed out of the LMA proposal with Fant in January 1996, and instead signed a deal with Osborne Communications Corporation to acquire the non-license assets of CBS affiliate WJSU-TV (channel 40, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WGWW) in Anniston under an LMA. The Allbritton deals served as the catalyst for an affiliation agreement between ABC and Allbritton in April 1996 that renewed or established new affiliation deals with the group&#x27;s seven television stations.

ABC and Allbritton reached a precursor agreement to that affiliation deal two months prior, after it declined an offer by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair&#x27;s notification to the network that the station had no intention of starting a news department and wanted to only carry its prime time and news programming led ABC to turn down an offer to affiliate with WTTO (which, along with WNAL and WDBB, was set to lose its Fox affiliation to WBRC). Under that deal, Allbritton agreed to make WCFT and WJSU the new Central Alabama affiliates of ABC, with WJSU initially intending to act as the satellite station to WCFT (Allbritton would subsequently purchase low-power independent station W58CK (channel 58, now WBMA-LD) in Birmingham to allow the two others to be counted in Nielsen ratings reports for that market). In January 1996, WNAL-TV became a secondary affiliate of The WB; it carried WB programming on tape delay on Sunday and Wednesday nights after Fox network programming. Fant Broadcasting subsequently approached CBS about switching to the network, and in February 1996, reached a deal to make WNAL-TV the network&#x27;s new affiliate for northeastern Alabama.

On September 1, 1996, when WBRC officially became a Fox owned-and-operated station and W58CK, WCFT and WJSU became ABC affiliates, WNAL officially discontinued its part-time simulcast of WTTO (which, along with WDBB, became independent stations); WCFT and WJSU ceded the CBS programming rights in central Alabama to WNAL, which became the CBS affiliate for the Anniston–Gadsden market, and WBMG, which had recently upgraded its transmitter to provide a much stronger full-power signal throughout much of the central third of the state. Channel 44&#x27;s switch left Central Alabama without a WB affiliate until WTTO/WDBB switched to the network in January 1997.

===Sale to Paxson Communications===
In September 1996, shortly after it became a CBS affiliate, Fant Broadcasting sold WNAL-TV to Paxson Communications (now Ion Media), which initially intended to shift it to its infomercial-focused Infomall TV Network (inTV). However, Paxson continued to operate the station as a CBS affiliate after the sale was completed, as its affiliation contract with CBS did not expire until April 1999.

On January 13, 1998, the station changed its call letters to WPXH in preparation of becoming the Birmingham market&#x27;s charter owned-and-operated station of Pax TV (later i: Independent Television, now Ion Television), though it would continue to honor the CBS affiliation contract in full even after the network&#x27;s debut on August 31, 1998. That year, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a tower near Inland Lake, south of Oneonta in Blount County.

In September 1998, Nielsen merged the Tuscaloosa and Anniston–Gadsden markets back into the Birmingham market as a result of the consolidation of WCFT, WJSU, and WBMA-LP into Birmingham&#x27;s ABC affiliate two years earlier, which expanded the designated market area to encompass nearly the entire width of the state, stretching from the Alabama–Georgia state line westward to the Mississippi–Alabama border. The move benefited all of the major Birmingham stations as it increased their available viewership in the three cities and resulted in the newly expanded market&#x27;s placement in Nielsen&#x27;s national market rankings jumping by twelve spots from 51st to 39th place.

WPXH officially disaffiliated from CBS on April 30, 1999, with Paxson deciding to hold out on converting the station to its network for a few months. The CBS affiliation rights for Central Alabama were then ceded exclusively to WIAT, which became the network&#x27;s sole affiliate for the enlarged Birmingham market. The station finally began to carry Pax TV on August 1, 1999.

In the late 2010s, what was now Ion Media applied to change WPXH&#x27;s physical channel from 45 to 33 as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation, along with moving its transmitter from Oneonta and into Birmingham proper, broadcasting from the Red Mountain site just south of town where the market&#x27;s other television stations originate. With the change, it would no longer have any signal serving Gadsden. WPXH-TV&#x27;s city of license was thus moved to the Birmingham suburb of Hoover. The new transmitter was activated early in 2020, centralizing channel 44 as a Birmingham area station once and for all.

==Newscasts==

Unlike other former independent stations and Fox affiliates that joined a Big Three network displaced due to Fox&#x27;s affiliation deals with longtime major network stations, WPXH-TV (as WNAL-TV) did not invest in its own news department after it was affiliated with CBS in September 1996. Instead of local news programming, WNAL opted to air religious programming on weekday mornings before &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; (as well as the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;) and at 10 p.m., and syndicated comedy and drama series at 5 and 6 p.m. In February 1998, the station entered into a news share agreement with Birmingham CBS affiliate WIAT (which temporarily shut down its news department the month prior, as part of a reboot of its news department in an effort to increase the persistently low ratings of its news programming), in which it would simulcast that station&#x27;s nightly 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts; the WIAT news simulcasts were dropped in May 1999, when channel 44 became an independent station.

In September 2001, as a Pax TV owned-and-operated station, WPXH entered into a news share agreement with WVTM-TV as part of an overall corporate management agreement between Paxson Communications and NBC. Under the agreement, WPXH-TV began airing rebroadcasts of WVTM&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts on a half-hour tape delay (at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m.) each Monday through Friday night. The newscasts were discontinued after the 10 p.m. news rebroadcast on June 30, 2005, as Paxson had decided to end the news share agreements for its owned-and-operated stations upon Pax&#x27;s rebranding as i: Independent Television.

The station ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 44, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 45, using virtual channel 44.

As it opted to become a participant of the Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act amendment in the DTV Delay Act, for two weeks after the transition date until June 26, 2009, WPXH-TV continued to provide programming on its analog signal to air a loop of public service announcements informing viewers on the digital transition.

<text>The Shahab-1 (, meaning &quot;Meteor-1&quot;) was the foundation of the short-range Iranian missile program. During the Iran–Iraq War, Iran purchased R-17 Elbrus missiles from Libya, Syria and North Korea (Hwasong-5). It is a close copy of Hwasong-5 (R-17).

Iran began making the Shahab-1 sometime between 1985 and 1988. Iran&#x27;s Shahab-1 is a short-range ballistic missile derived from the Scud-B, and has a maximum range of 300 km (185 miles).

Iran employed Shahab 1s extensively during the 1990s and early 2000s against Mujahidin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) camps in Iraq.

==Variants==
Shahab is the name of a class of Iranian missiles, service time of &quot;c.&quot; 1987–present, which comes in six variants: Shahab-1, Shahab-2, Shahab-3, Shahab-4, Shahab-5, and Shahab-6.

<doc id="1172427" wikidata="Q1283371" url="?curid=1172427" title="Maneuver warfare">
<text>Maneuver warfare, or manoeuvre warfare, is a military strategy which emphasizes movement, initiative and surprise to achieve a position of advantage. Maneuver seeks to inflict losses indirectly by envelopment, encirclement and disruption, while minimizing the need to engage in frontal combat. In contrast to attrition warfare where strength tends to be applied against strength, maneuver warfare attempts to apply strength against weakness in order to accomplish the mission.

Maneuver warfare, the use of initiative, originality and the unexpected, combined with a ruthless determination to succeed, seeks to avoid opponents&#x27; strengths while exploiting their weaknesses and attacking their critical vulnerabilities and is the conceptual opposite of attrition warfare. Rather than seeking victory by applying superior force and mass to achieve physical destruction, maneuver uses preemption, deception, dislocation, and disruption to destroy the enemy&#x27;s will and ability to fight.

Historically, maneuver warfare was stressed by small militaries, more cohesive, better trained, or more technologically advanced than attrition warfare counterparts. The term &quot;tactical maneuver&quot; is used by maneuver warfare theorists to refer to movement by forces to gain &quot;advantageous position relative to the enemy,&quot; as opposed to its use in the phrase &quot;maneuver warfare.&quot;

The idea of using rapid movement to keep an enemy off balance is as old as war itself. However, advanced technology, such as the development of cavalry and mechanized vehicles, has led to an increased interest in the concepts of maneuver warfare and in its role on modern battlefields.

== Concepts ==

Although most battles between established armies have historically been fought based on attrition warfare strategies, many military doctrines and cultures are based on replete historical examples of maneuver warfare.

The view on attrition warfare involves moving masses of men and materiel against enemy strongpoints, with the emphasis on the destruction of the enemy&#x27;s physical assets, success as measured by enemy combatants killed, equipment and infrastructure destroyed, and territory taken or occupied. Attrition warfare tends to use rigidly-centralized command structures that require little or no creativity or initiative from lower-level leadership (also called top-down or &quot;command push&quot; tactics).

Conventional warfare doctrine identifies a spectrum with attrition warfare and maneuver warfare on opposite ends. In attrition warfare, the enemy is seen as a collection of targets to be found and destroyed. It exploits maneuver to bring to bear firepower to destroy enemy forces. Maneuver warfare, on the other hand, exploits firepower and attrition on key elements of opposing forces.

Maneuver warfare suggest that strategic movement can bring the defeat of an opposing force more efficiently than simply contacting and destroying enemy forces until they can no longer fight. Instead, in maneuver warfare, the destruction of certain enemy targets, such as command and control centers, logistical bases, or fire support assets, is combined with isolation of enemy forces and the exploitation by movement of enemy weaknesses.

Bypassing and cutting off enemy strongpoints often results in the collapse of that strongpoint even where the physical damage is minimal, such as the Maginot Line. Firepower, primarily used to destroy as many enemy forces as possible in attrition warfare, is used to suppress or destroy enemy positions at breakthrough points during maneuver warfare. Infiltration tactics, conventionally or with special forces, may be used extensively to cause chaos and confusion behind enemy lines.

The retired officer and military theory author Robert Leonhard summarizes maneuver warfare theory as &quot;preempt, dislocate, and disrupt&quot; the enemy as alternatives to the destruction of enemy mass through attrition warfare.

Since tempo and initiative are so critical to the success of maneuver warfare, command structures tend to be more decentralized with more tactical freedom given to lower-level unit leaders. Decentralized command structures allows &quot;on the ground&quot; unit leaders but still works within the guidelines of the commander&#x27;s overall vision, to exploit enemy weaknesses as they become evident, which is also called &quot;recon-pull&quot; tactics or directive control.

The war theorist Martin van Creveld identifies six main elements of maneuver warfare:
* Tempo: as illustrated by John Boyd&#x27;s OODA loop.
* &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; (&#x27;focal point&#x27;): the center of effort, or striking the enemy at the right place at the right time. According to van Creveld, ideally, a spot that is both vital and weakly defended.
* Surprise: Leaving the enemy unable to counter an action is central to any maneuver, and may be achieved by their remaining unaware for as long as possible
* Combined arms: the use of multiple means by which to attack the enemy creates an opportunity cost to any reaction. Should the enemy counter against one form of attack, they may leave themselves vulnerable to another. Additionally, different forms of attack may support each other through concurrent action (ex: Infantry supporting armor in such a way that the infantry has more available firepower, and the armor has protection from ambush)
* Flexibility: a military must be well rounded, self-contained and redundant. By maintaining different avenues of attack, either in method, movement, or any other factor, alternatives are always available, and opportunities can always be seized
* Decentralized command: rapidly changing situations may outpace the orders of a centralized command, leaving personnel with instructions that no longer apply. Lower levels of command must understand overall intent so as to adapt to a changing environment.

==History==
===Early examples===

For most of history, armies were slower than a marching soldier, making it possible for opposing armies to march around each other as long as they wished. Supply conditions often decided where and when the battle would finally start. Prehistorically, that began to change with the domestication of the horse, the invention of chariots, and increasing military use of cavalry. It had two major uses: to attack and use its momentum to break infantry formations and to use the advantage of speed to cut communications and isolate formations for later defeat in detail.

The retreat of the center of the Athenian and Platean citizen-soldiers (Hoplites) at the battle of Marathon against the forces of Datis in 490 BC, and subsequent pincer movements by Athenian forces on the flanks, used a similar tactic. The intention was to bring the Persian core forces forward—Persian and Saka axemen. The Hoplite flanks would then drive off their opposite numbers and enveloped the Persian center. Before the battle, Datis had re-embarked his cavalry—to which the hoplite formations had little real defense—which substantially weakened his position.

Khalid&#x27;s invasion of Roman Syria in July 634—by invading Syria from an unexpected direction, the Syrian Desert—is another example of taking enemy defenses by surprise. While the Byzantine army held the Muslim forces in southern Syria and had expected reinforcement from the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, Khalid, who was in Iraq, marched through the Syrian desert and entered northern Syria, completely taking the Byzantines by surprise and cutting off their communications with northern Syria.

=== Mongol use ===

The Mongol emperor Genghis Khan used a military system of maneuver warfare that focused on rapid, decisive maneuver, utilizing the skill and endurance of his Mongol horsemen. He used operational maneuver, command and control, deception, and precise battlefield tactics which were vastly superior to those of his opponents in China, Russia, Persia, and Eastern Europe and defeated virtually every enemy army that he faced.

An example of his usage of maneuver warfare was the defeat and annexation of the Khwarazmian Empire between 1219 and 1221 CE, which wielded an army nearly three times the Mongol army, in just a few months of fighting. The Mongol army&#x27;s constant movement and maneuvering tied down the Khwarazmian forces, denying them the ability to gain the initiative as well as shocked and demoralized the Khwarazmian Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad as well as his army, thus ending the campaign before the Shah could bring to bear his much larger numbers.

=== Napoleon&#x27;s use ===

Similar strategies are also possible using suitably trained infantry. Napoleon I used preemptive movements of cavalry and fast infantry to interrupt the initial deployment of enemy forces. This allowed his forces to attack where and when he wanted, enabling force concentration, possibly in combination with advantage of terrain. It disabled effective coordination of enemy forces, even when they were superior in numbers. That was effective tactically and strategically.

During his time as a general and indeed his power base to become the head of France, Napoleon&#x27;s reputation was based on a powerful and fluent campaign in northern Italy, opposing the numerically superior Austrians. He cited Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne as one major source of his strategy.

He trained a normal, if rather undisciplined, French Army of Italy into moving faster than most thought possible. That was partially because his army lived off the land and had no big logistical &quot;tail.&quot; Both his ability to move huge armies to give battle where he wanted and the style of his choice would become legendary, and he was seen as undefeatable, even against larger and superior forces.

Napoleon also arranged his forces into what would be known in the present as &quot;battle groups&quot; of combined arms formations to allow faster reaction time to enemy action. That strategy is an important quality in supporting the effectiveness of maneuver warfare and was used again by Carl von Clausewitz.

Napoleon&#x27;s principal strategy was to move fast to engage before the enemy had time to organize, to engage lightly while moving to turn the flank that defended the main resupply route, to envelop and deploy blocking forces to prevent reinforcement, and to defeat those contained in the envelopment in detail. All of those activities imply faster movement than the enemy as well as faster reaction times to enemy activities.

His use of fast mass marches to gain strategic advantage, cavalry probes, and screens to hide his movements; deliberate movement to gain psychological advantage by isolating forces from one another; and their headquarters are all hallmarks of maneuver warfare. One of his major concerns was the relatively slow speed of infantry movement relative to the cavalry.

It was that and subsequent defeats that caused a major doctrinal reevaluation by the Prussians under Clausewitz of the revealed power of maneuver warfare. The results of that review were seen in the Franco-Prussian War.

===Mechanization===

In the mid-19th century, various forms of mechanized transport were introduced, starting with trains running on steam power. That resulted in significant logistic improvements. Opposing armies were no longer limited in speed by the pace of march. Some train-borne maneuvering took place during the American Civil War in the 1860s, but the sizes of the armies involved meant that the system could provide only limited support. Armored trains were among the first armored fighting vehicles employed by mankind.

During the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussians, knowing that the French could field a larger army than theirs, made a plan that required speed by surrounding the French strongpoints and destroying or bypassing them; it was called the &quot;Kesselschlacht&quot;, or &#x27;cauldron battle&#x27;. The remainder of the army could advance unopposed to take important objectives. If war was declared, Prussia could quickly mobilize and invade, destroy French field forces, and win before the French army could fully react. That tactic was used to devastating effect in 1870 since Prussian forces surrounded and defeated French forces, captured Napoleon III and besieged Paris. The Germans&#x27; battle plans for World War I were similar. Germany attempted to repeat the &quot;knock-out blow&quot; against the French armies in the Schlieffen Plan. However, technology evolved significantly in the preceding four decades; both the machine gun and more powerful artillery shifted the balance of power toward the defense. All combatants were desperate to get the front moving again, but that proved to be difficult.

Germany introduced new tactics with infiltration and stormtrooper &quot;shock troops&quot; toward the end of World War I to bypass resistance. Russian general Aleksei Brusilov used similar tactics in 1916 on the Eastern Front during the Brusilov Offensive.

The introduction of fully armored tanks, in a series of increasingly successful operations, presented a way out of the deadlock of attrition and trench warfare, but World War I ended before the British would field thousands of tanks to be put in a large-scale offense. Fuller had proposed Plan 1919 to use tanks to break through the lines and then to wreak havoc on the German lines of supply and communication.

During the interwar period, the British developed ideas for fully-mechanized all-arms warfare with the Experimental Mechanized Force. The Germans reviewed their doctrine and revised their approach by expanding on infiltration tactics and amplifying them with motor transport. Heinz Guderian was a leading proponent of armored combat. The German military stressed several key elements: versatile tanks combined with mobile infantry and artillery, close air support, rapid movement and concentration of forces (&quot;Schwerpunkt&quot;), and aggressive independent local initiative. All was strictly coordinated by radio and contributed to new tactics during the Battle of France in 1940. Theories in Germany about armored warfare have some similarities with interwar theories of British officers J.F.C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart, which the British army failed to embrace and understand fully.

There are similarities between blitzkrieg and the Soviet concept of &quot;deep battle,&quot; which the Soviets used to great effect in 1944 and continued to use as a doctrine during the Cold War.

=== Soviet deep battle ===
In the Soviet Union during the 1920s and the 1930s, the concept of &quot;deep battle&quot; was developed and integrated into the Red Army field regulations doctrine by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. That led to the creation of cavalry mechanised groups during World War II and to operational maneuver groups during the Cold War.

===US Marine Corps doctrine===
According to the US Marine Corps, one key concept of maneuver warfare is that maneuver is traditionally thought of as a spatial concept, the use of maneuver to gain positional advantage. The US Marine concept of maneuver, however, is a &quot;warfighting philosophy that seeks to shatter the enemy&#x27;s cohesion through a variety of rapid, focused, and unexpected actions which create a turbulent and rapidly deteriorating situation with which the enemy cannot cope.&quot;

The US Marine manual goes on to say: &quot;This is not to imply that firepower is unimportant. On the contrary, firepower is central to maneuver warfare. Nor do we mean to imply that we will pass up the opportunity to physically destroy the enemy. We will concentrate fires and forces at decisive points to destroy enemy elements when the opportunity presents itself and when it fits our larger purposes.&quot;

The possibility of a massive Soviet offensive in Western Europe led to the creation of the US Army&#x27;s AirLand battle doctrine. Though far from focusing on maneuver, it emphasized using combined arms to disrupt an enemy&#x27;s plan by striking through their depth and was seen as moving toward maneuver warfare in comparison to the earlier active defense concept. The AirLand doctrine was seen by Martin van Creveld as &quot;arguably a half way house between maneuver and attrition&quot;.

===British air maneuver doctrine===
The British Joint Forces are limited to consider &quot;air assault&quot; or &quot;airmobile&quot; operations in their 2016 publication &quot;Joint Doctrine Note on Air Manoeuvre&quot;.

===Limitations in a modern context===
A key requirement for success in maneuver warfare is up-to-date accurate intelligence on the disposition of key enemy command, support, and combat units. In operations whose intelligence is either inaccurate, unavailable, or unreliable, the successful implementation of strategies based on maneuver warfare can become problematic. When faced with a maneuverable opponent capable of redeploying key forces quickly and discreetly or when tempered, the capacity of maneuver warfare strategies to deliver victory becomes more challenging.

The 2006 Lebanon War is an example of such shortcomings being exposed. Despite overwhelming firepower and complete air superiority, Israeli forces were unable to deliver a decisive blow to the command structure of Hezbollah or to degrade its effective capacity to operate. Although inflicting heavy damage, Israel was unable to locate and destroy Hezbollah&#x27;s diluted force dispositions or to neutralize key command centers. Therefore, it did not meet its war aims. The insurgency in Iraq also demonstrates that a military victory over an opponent&#x27;s conventional forces does not automatically translate into a political victory.

Some military theorists such as William Lind and Colonel Thomas X. Hammes propose to overcome the shortcomings of maneuver warfare with the concept of what they call fourth generation warfare. For example, Lieutenant-Colonel S.P. Myers writes that &quot;maneuver is more a philosophical approach to campaign design and execution than an arrangement of tactical engagements&quot;. Myers goes on to write that maneuver warfare can evolve and that &quot;maneuverist approach in campaign design and execution remains relevant and effective as a counter-insurgency strategy at the operational level in contemporary operations.&quot;

In the early stages of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia&#x27;s advances were stalled by Ukraine&#x27;s widespread deployment of man-portable anti-tank missiles. The scholar Seth Jones argued that Russia was forced to abandon maneuver warfare after an inept failure to apply combined arms, forcing a transition to a war of attrition. Ukrainian forces attempted to use maneuver warfare during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive but their advances became stalled due to Russian prepared defenses in the form of minefields and trenches. Later in the war, Ukrainian forces used maneuver warfare more effectively during the start of the 2024 Kursk Oblast incursion where Russian forces initially struggled to repel the attack. However, that advance later stalled. According to Michael Kofman &quot;Russian forces do far better when they&#x27;re operating with prepared defense, fixed lines, more on positional warfare.&quot;

<text>Brunner is a lunar impact crater that is located along the eastern limb of the Moon, to the southeast of the Mare Smythii. At this location the crater is viewed from the edge, and so it is not possible to see much detail from the Earth. The visibility of this formation is also affected by libration. The crater lies to the southwest of the walled plain Hirayama, and to the east of the elongated crater Houtermans.

The rim of Brunner is well-defined and nearly circular, although there is a slight outward bulge and a depressed wall along the north. The interior of the crater is rugged and irregular, with a central ridge formation at the midpoint. There is also a ring-like formation on the floor that is concentric with the inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brunner.

<text>William Turnbull (died 3 September 1454) was a Scottish politician and bishop, credited with founding Jedburgh Grammar School and the University of Glasgow. He served as the Bishop of Glasgow, from 1448 to 1454 and was the first Chancellor of the University of Glasgow.

==Biography==
He came from Bedrule in the Scottish Borders, where a plaque in the local church is erected in his memory.

He studied arts at the University of St Andrews (1419), canon law at the University of Leuven, and went on to study at the University of Pavia, Italy, for a doctorate in canon law (1439).

Upon his return to Scotland, he befriended King James II and became Keeper of the Privy Seal (1440–1448) and &quot;Royal Secretary&quot; (1441–1442). In 1447 he was appointed Bishop of Dunkeld, then a year later Bishop of Glasgow which he held until his death in 1454.

On 28 October 1447, John Pigott, the manorial lord, presented Ven William Turnbull, &quot;Bishop of Dunkeld,&quot; to the Rectory of Abington Pigotts, in the Diocese of Ely.

During his time as Bishop, he pursued the formation of a university in Glasgow with the encouragement of King James. On 7 January 1451, Pope Nicholas V issued a papal bull decreeing the foundation of the University of Glasgow, which started classes in the Glasgow Cathedral buildings, with Turnbull as the first chancellor. Turnbull is credited with founding Jedburgh Grammar School at Jedburgh Abbey.

Turnbull High School in Bishopbriggs is named after him, as is Turnbull Hall, the Catholic Chaplaincy at the University of Glasgow.

<text>The German People&#x27;s Union (, DVU, also &quot;Liste D&quot;) was a right-wing nationalist political party in Germany. It was founded by publisher Gerhard Frey as an informal association in 1971 and established as a party in 1987. In 2011, it merged with the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).

The party never reached the five-percent minimum in federal elections that is generally necessary to enter the Bundestag. The DVU won seats in several state parliaments.

The party, throughout its history, was financially completely dependent on Frey, something that caused it to be dubbed &quot;Frey&#x27;s Party&quot;.

==History==
The DVU was formed as an association, not a party, by Gerhard Frey and twelve others, former members of other right-wing organisations or conservative parties as well as from various groups in the Federation of Expellees. In the early years, before the organisation became a party in 1987, it was predominantly active in propagating revisionist views about the Holocaust and Germany&#x27;s role in World War II, predominately through Frey&#x27;s media empire and his &quot;National Zeitung.

With the decline of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany, the NPD, from 1969 onward, the German People&#x27;s Union became a new home for many former supporters of this party. The DVU, however, stayed away from party politics and instead organised protest marches against the German government&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, the rapprochement with Poland and Eastern Europe. It formed a number of action committees:
*&quot;Volksbewegung für Generalamnestie&quot; (1979) – People&#x27;s Movement for General Amnesty 
*&quot;Initiative für Ausländerbegrenzung&quot; (1980) – Initiative for the limitation of foreigners 
*&quot;Aktion deutsches Radio und Fernsehen&quot; (1981) – German action for radio and television
*&quot;Ehrenbund Rudel - Gemeinschaft zum Schutz der Frontsoldaten&quot; (1983) – Honour federation Rudel – Community for the protection of the front soldiers (named after Hans-Ulrich Rudel and established during a memorial service after the latter&#x27;s death)
*&quot;Deutschen Schutzbund für Volk und Kultur&quot; – German Protective Association for People and Culture
*&quot;Aktion Oder-Neiße&quot; - Action Oder-Neisse

Membership in the DVU fluctuated in the following years but stood at 12,000 by 1986, making it the largest registered far-right organisation in Germany at the time. On 5 March 1987, the association became a party with the help of a large number of former NPD officials, something Frey had started planning the year before. Initially the party was called &quot;Deutsche Volksliste&quot;, which soon changed to &quot;Deutsche Volksunion-Liste D&quot; and, in 1991, just &quot;Deutsche Volksunion&quot;.

Frey&#x27;s official reason for forming a party at the time was his disappointment with the German conservative-liberal Federal Government in regards to foreigners, security and policy towards East Germany. The new party formed an alliance with the NPD, generally agreeing not to compete with each other in elections. The DVU was financially well-off, courtesy of Frey&#x27;s personal wealth, but lacked election expertise, while the NPD had the latter but was financially weak.

In September 1987, the DVU became the first far-right party in Germany in 20 years to win a seat in a state parliament when it entered the Parliament of Bremen, courtesy to winning 5.4 percent of the votes in Bremerhaven. Despite missing the five percent cut off in Bremen overall, gaining only 3.41 percent of the vote in the city-state, the special provisions in Bremen allowed for a party to enter parliament if it passed the five percent mark in one of the two parts of the state. Frey had spent more money on the Bremen campaign than the major party in the state combined and benefited from targeting protest voters.

Karl Heinz Sendbühler, a high-ranking member of the NPD, stated in 1989 that, with Frey&#x27;s money, the charisma of Franz Schönhuber, leader of The Republicans at the time, and the NPD organisation, no German parliament would be safe from such an alliance. However, the personal dislike between Schönhuber and Frey made such an alliance impossible, with Frey accusing Schönhuber of being in league with the German conservatives while the latter called Frey a trader of devotional articles.

Frey continued to spend heavily on elections, investing DM 17 million on the 1989 European Parliament election, but winning only 1.6 percent of the votes in Germany, compared to 7.1 percent for their right-wing competitors, The Republicans (REP). Despite this financial and political defeat, the DVU expanded its membership to 25,000 by 1989, and won six seats in the Parliament of Bremen in 1991, becoming the third-largest party there. In the following year it won 6.3 percent in the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein but failed to win seats in the Hamburg state election in September 1993, where competition between the DVU and REP kept both out of parliament.

By 1994, the DVU was in a financially difficult situation while also experiencing a breakdown of relations with the NPD. A short-term alliance with the REP did not last and it was unable to compete in elections for a time. The DVU membership declined and it lost its seats in the Bremen election of 1995, despite spending DM 2 million on the campaign. After losing its seats in Schleswig-Holstein the following year it achieved a better result in Hamburg in 1997, gaining 4,97 percent of the votes, just 190 votes short of earning seats in the state parliament.

Frey attempted to form alliances with the other two major far-right and right-wing parties in Germany but was rebuffed by the REP as being too extremist and by the NPD as being too moderate and business-orientated. In 1998 the DVU achieved its greatest election success, winning 12.8 percent, 16 seats, in Saxony-Anhalt, and a quarter of all votes of the young voters aged 18 to 25. However, by the following year, the DVU fraction was split by infighting and a number of the party&#x27;s members of parliament left the DVU.

The final years of the party saw it lose a substantial number of members and the aging of the remainder. By the time of its merger with the NPD in 2010 the party had just 3,000 members, half the number the NPD had.

In 2004, the DVU entered a non-competition agreement with the NPD for the state elections in Brandenburg and Saxony. Both parties passed the five-percent threshold in their respective states. The DVU reached 6.1 percent in the Brandenburg state elections, and the NPD won 9.2 percent in the Saxony state elections. After this relatively successful election, the parties formed an electoral alliance for the 2005 federal elections. The joint NPD-DVU slate, which ran under the NPD&#x27;s ballot line, won 1.6 percent of the total votes nationally.

In 2009, party founder Frey did not run for reelection as chairman and was replaced by Matthias Faust. In 2010, a referendum of party members approved a merger of the DVU and the NPD. Several state sections of the DVU objected to the merger and achieved a preliminary injunction from the Landgericht Munich based on irregularities during the referendum. On May 26, 2012, these objections were withdrawn and the DVU was declared defunct. Several branches and individuals objected to the perceived links between the NPD and Nazism and instead joined with the smaller party the Republicans, who were considered more moderate. This was especially true in North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria, where the Republicans were traditionally strongest. Some other individuals formed a new party called Die Rechte (meaning &quot;the Right&quot;).

==Assessment==
The party was, from the start, under observation by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, who declared the party&#x27;s policies to be in violation of the German constitution. The DVU was classified as xenophobic, nationalistic, historical revisionist and as a protest party against the alleged failure of the mainstream political parties.

DVU candidates in state elections rarely made appearances, remaining in the background. Instead of election rallies, the party invested in posters and flyers, targeting protest voters. Candidates for state elections were hand-picked by Frey after private interviews, and not elected by the party.

Because of Frey&#x27;s authoritarian leadership, the DVU was often dubbed the &quot;Frey Party&quot; and its financial dependence on Frey ensured that independent party activities were impossible. DVU fractions in state parliaments soon fractured because of Frey&#x27;s overreaching control and the party soon folded after Frey stepped down in 2009. &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, after the party&#x27;s success in the 1998 Saxony-Anhalt state elections, described the DVU as &quot;less a political party than the dangerous plaything of a millionaire&quot;, without any real party structure. At the time, Frey&#x27;s personal fortune was estimated to be in excess of DM 500 million.

<text>Elbridge Gerry (December 6, 1813 – April 10, 1886) was an American lawyer, who served as a U.S. Congressman from Maine from 1849 to 1851.

==Biography==
Gerry was born on December 6, 1813, in Waterford, Massachusetts (now in Maine); he was the son of Peter and Mary &quot;Polly&quot; (Cutler) Gerry. He attended Bridgton Academy, and studied law with Judge Stephen Emery (who also served as Maine&#x27;s Attorney General). Gerry was admitted to the bar in 1839 and established a practice in Waterford.

Gerry&#x27;s father served in the Maine House of Representatives and in local offices including selectman and town meeting moderator. Gerry also served in local offices in Waterford, including town clerk (1842-1843), and town meeting moderator (1847, 1852).

He was clerk of the Maine House of Representatives in 1840, and was appointed a United States commissioner in bankruptcy in 1841. From 1842 to 1845 he was prosecuting attorney for Oxford County. In 1846 he served in the Maine House of Representatives, including holding the post of Speaker &quot;Pro tempore&quot; during the absence of Speaker Ebenezer Knowlton.

He was elected to a single term in Congress as a Democrat in 1848, and served from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1851. He did not run for reelection in 1850, and moved to Portland to continue the practice of law.

He died in Portland on April 10, 1886, and was buried at Portland&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

==Family==
In 1849, Gerry married Anna St. Clair Jenness, the daughter of Richard and Caroline Jenness of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. They were the parents of three children: Alice, Elbridge, and Elizabeth.

Alice Gerry (1850-1921) was the wife of Arthur Melville Patterson of Baltimore, Maryland. After his death, she married John Stewart, the grandson of David Stewart. After her 1913 divorce, she married Francis B. Griswold.

Elbridge Gerry (1853-1907) graduated from Bowdoin College and Harvard Law School. He practiced law in Maine and New York City before accepting appointment as vice consul in Le Havre, France, in 1885. He remained in Europe after resigning in 1887, and died in Siena, Italy.

Elizabeth Jenness Gerry (1852-1912), was the wife of Greek diplomat Constantin Pangiris.

==Note==
Many sources indicate that Elbridge Gerry (1813-1886) was the grandson of Elbridge Gerry (1744-1814). This seems to be in error; the ancestry of Elbridge Gerry (1813-1886) can be traced to his father Peter (1776-1847); Peter&#x27;s father Nathaniel Gerry (or Geary) (1733-1791); Nathaniel&#x27;s father Thomas; Nathaniel&#x27;s grandfather, also named Thomas; and Nathaniel&#x27;s great-grandfather Thomas Gery (or Gary).
