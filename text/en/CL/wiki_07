<text>The Royal Netherlands Army (, KL) is the land branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces. Though the Royal Netherlands Army was raised on 9 January 1814, its origins date back to 1572, when the was raised making the Dutch standing army one of the oldest in the world. It fought in the Napoleonic Wars, World War II, the Indonesian War of Independence and the Korean War, as well as served with NATO on the Cold War frontiers in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1990s.

Since 1990, the army has been sent into the Iraq War (from 2003) and into the War in Afghanistan, as well as deployed in several United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping missions (notably with UNIFIL in Lebanon, UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina and MINUSMA in Mali).

The tasks of the Royal Netherlands Army are laid out in the Constitution of the Netherlands: defend the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including the Dutch Caribbean) and all of its allies, protect and advance the international legal order and to support the (local) government in law enforcement, disaster relief and humanitarian aid, both nationally and internationally. The supreme authority over the Armed Forces of the Netherlands is exercised by the government (consisting of the King and the cabinet ministers); there is thus no constitutional supreme commander. However, army personnel do swear allegiance to the Dutch monarch.

Dutch army doctrine strongly emphasises international co-operation. The Netherlands are a founding member of, and strong contributor to NATO, while closely co-operating with fellow member states during European Union-led missions as well. Moreover, the successful Dutch-German military co-operation is seen as a harbinger of European defence integration, facing fewer linguistic and cultural issues than the comparable Franco-German Brigade. In 2014, the 11 Airmobile Brigade was integrated into the Rapid Forces Division; in 2016, the Dutch-German 414 Tank Battalion was integrated into the 43rd Mechanised Brigade, which was in turn integrated into the 1st Panzer Division. In 2023, the final brigade of the Royal Netherlands Army, the 13th Light Brigade, was integrated into the 10th Panzer Division of the German Bundeswehr.

Additionally, the German Air Defence Missile Group 61 () was integrated into the Dutch Joint Ground-based Air Defence Command in 2018.

==History==
===Origins===

The Royal Netherlands Army was raised on 9 January 1814, but its origins date back to the founding of the (the Army of the Dutch States) in 1572: the creation of one of the first modern standing armies. Under the command of famous commanders such as Maurice of Orange and William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg, the army developed widely.

The Dutch States Army of the Dutch Republic saw action in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Dano-Swedish War, the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, as well as the French Revolutionary Wars.

===French period (1795–1814)===
With the French conquest of the Netherlands, the was replaced by the army of the Batavian Republic in 1795, which in turn was replaced by the army of the Kingdom of Holland in 1806. This army fought beside the French, to repel the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799 and to wage several campaigns in Germany, Austria, and Spain between 1800 and 1810; particularly notable were the engagements of the Horse Artillery (Korps Rijdende Artillerie) at the Battle of Friedland in 1807, the capture of the city of Stralsund in 1807 and 1809, and the participation of the Dutch brigade in the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1810. The independent army was disbanded in 1810, when Napoleon decided to integrate the Netherlands into France (&quot;&quot;): Dutch military units became part of the (the present-day French 126th Infantry Regiment has Dutch origins). Dutch military elements participated in the disastrous French invasion of Russia in 1812, and the actions of the Pontonniers company under Captain Benthien at the Berezina River (Battle of Berezina) are especially noteworthy. New research points out that, contrary to long-held belief, around half of the Dutch contingent of the Grande Armée survived the Russian Campaign.

===Kingdom of the Netherlands (1814–1914)===
In 1814, a year after the return of William I of the Netherlands to Scheveningen and the Orangist uprising against Napoleonic rule, an independent Dutch army was reformed by the new Kingdom of the United Netherlands. Several militias of the Dutch States Army were integrated into this newly formed Netherlands Mobile Army, and it became an integral part of the allied army during the Hundred Days campaign that culminated in the Battle of Waterloo. Units such as Baron Chassé&#x27;s were essential to securing victory for the allied army. The army was involved in various conflicts since 1814, including the Waterloo campaign (1815) and different colonial wars (1825–1925).

During the Belgian Revolution, from 1830 to 1832, the army was deployed to restore order in the southern provinces. After initial Dutch military success and widespread Belgian defeat during battles of the Ten Days&#x27; Campaign, the Belgian rebels appealed to France for military support. The severely outnumbered Dutch troops were forced to retreat when the French agreed to send reinforcements.

===World wars (1914–1945)===

The Netherlands continued the policy of neutrality during World War I. This stance arose partly from a strict policy of neutrality in international affairs that started in 1830 with the secession of Belgium. Dutch neutrality was not guaranteed by the major powers in Europe however, nor was it a part of the Dutch constitution. The country&#x27;s neutrality was based on the belief that its strategic position between the German Empire, German-occupied Belgium, and the British guaranteed its safety. The Dutch military strategy was aimed exclusively at defence and rested to a large extent on the Dutch Water Line, a defensive ring of rivers and lowland surrounding the core Dutch region of Holland, that could be inundated.

At the beginning of the Second World War, the I Corps was the force strategic reserve and was located in the Vesting Holland, around The Hague, Leiden, Haarlem and in the Westland. The German invasion posed a complete surprise for the army command and shocked the Dutch population. While the Royal Netherlands Army initially managed to slow down the German advance and fought back in intense battles, such as the Battle for The Hague, the Battle of Rotterdam and the Battle of the Afsluitdijk, the devastating German bombing of Rotterdam and the threat of bombing the city of Utrecht forced the Dutch supreme command to capitulate.

The Royal Netherlands army was disbanded during the German occupation, however army personnel continued the battle against the German occupiers during the war. Army resistance began to rise again with the formation of the Princess Irene Brigade and No. 2 (Dutch) Troop (predecessor to the Korps Commandotroepen) as part of the Free Dutch Forces in exile, and with army personnel active in the Dutch resistance. In the East, the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army was defeated by the Japanese in 1942; few elements managed to escape. Today&#x27;s army grew out of the wartime force, starting with the liberation of parts of the Netherlands in 1944; the Dutch had plans to contribute a 200,000 strong army to the defeat of Germany and Japan.

===Decolonisation and Cold War (1945–1991)===
====Dutch East Indies====
Between 1945 and 1949, the Royal Netherlands Army, which originally used mainly war volunteers but later was heavily dependent on conscripts, was deployed to the Dutch East Indies during the Indonesian War of Independence. To restore Dutch authority in the Dutch East Indies, the expeditionary land force First Division &quot;7 December&quot; was established in 1946. Approximately 25,000 volunteers and 95,000 conscripts were deployed to the East during the conflict, 4,751 servicemen were killed.

====Cold War====

During the Korean War, 4,748 members of the army, the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Netherlands Marine Corps formed the and were dispatched to East Asia to fight against the troops of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and North Korea. 122 soldiers were killed in action, 3 soldiers went missing in action.
The I (Netherlands) Corps stood watch alongside its NATO allies in Germany during the Cold War. The corps consisted of three divisions during the 1980s, the 1st, 4th, and 5th (reserve) divisions. It was part of the NATO Northern Army Group. The corps&#x27;s war assignment, as formulated by Commander, Northern Army Group (COMNORTHAG), would be to:

*Assume responsibility for its corps sector and relieve 1st German Corps forces as soon as possible.
*Fight the covering force battle in accordance with COMNORTHAG&#x27;s concept of operations.
*In the main defensive battle: (1) hold and destroy the forces of the enemy&#x27;s leading armies conventionally as far east as possible, maintaining cohesion with 1 (GE) Corps; (2) in the event of a major penetration affecting 1 (NL) Corps sector, be prepared to hold the area between the roads A7 and B3 and to conduct a counterattack according to COMNORTHAG&#x27;s concept of operations.
*Maintain cohesion with LANDJUT and secure NORTHAG&#x27;s left flank in the Forward Combat Zone.

Dutch army troops have deployed to Lebanon as part of an international protection force since 1979 War in Lebanon, 1979–1985 UNIFIL. Of the 9,084 soldiers who served in Lebanon, 9 soldiers were killed in action.

===Recent history (1991–present)===
The Fall of the Iron Curtain and the ensuing end of the Cold War has had a significant impact on the Dutch armed forces as a whole, but on the army in particular. Mandatory conscription was suspended and surplus equipment deemed unnecessary was sold. An airmobile brigade was formed and co-operation with allied countries, Germany in particular, was intensified. The I (NL) Corps was reduced to the First Division &quot;7 December&quot; in 1995, which became part of the newly established I. German/Dutch Corps, and consequently the division headquarters itself was disbanded. In addition, the army increasingly concentrated on peace-keeping and peace-enforcing operations and has been involved in several operations in the former Yugoslavia (1991–present), but also in Cambodia (1992–1994), Haiti (1995–1996), Cyprus (1998–1999), Eritrea and Ethiopia (2001), and most recent in Iraq (2003–2005), Afghanistan (2002–present), Chad (2008–2009) and Mali (2014–2019).

As mentioned, peace dividend was collected throughout the 1990s, 2000s and early 2010s resulting in a dramatic downsizing in both budget and size. Of a total of 445 Leopard 2 MBTs originally purchased, 114 tanks and 1 turret were sold to Austria, 100 to Canada, 57 to Norway, 1 driver training tank and 10 turrets to Germany and 38 to Portugal (1 driver training tank). On 8 April 2011, the Dutch Ministry of Defense dissolved the last tank unit and sold the remaining Leopard tanks due another series of large budget cuts while also dismissing 6,000 servicemen and women. On 18 May 2011, the last Leopard 2 fired the final shot at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area. In 2014, the Dutch defence budget hit a new low, 7.4 billion euros (1.09% of GDP), resulting in the combat readiness of both personnel and equipment being subpar. The negative trend was broken from 2015 onwards due to a perceived shifting international security situation. The attitude towards defence changed, mainly caused by increasing tensions with Russia (caused by the downing of the MH17 flight and the annexation of Crimea) and the rise of the Islamic State, resulting in the defence budget seeing an increase of over 50 percent between 2014 and 2020, amounting to 11.04 billion euros (1.35% of GDP) in 2020. In September 2024 it was announced that the Netherlands will acquire new tanks.

====Bosnia====
Dutch army personnel was deployed to Bosnia between 1994 and 1995 to, as part of the UN peace force UNPROFOR, to restrain the escalating ethnic violence of the Bosnian War. Three infantry battalion (known as Dutchbats) of the, at the time, recently established 11 Air Assault Brigade were sequentially deployed to guard the United Nations Safe Areas of any possible threats. This mission became infamous following the Siege of Srebrenica and the ensuing Srebrenica massacre. Bosnian Serb troops under the command of general Ratko Mladic, sentenced to life imprisonment on accounts of participating in genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in 2017, invaded the enclave of Srebrenica and subsequently deported and massacred a large share of the present Bosniak men and boys.

====Iraq====
A contingent of 1,345 troops (comprising Army and Dutch Marines, supported by Royal Netherlands Air Force helicopters) was deployed to Iraq in 2003, based at Camp Smitty near As Samawah (Southern Iraq) with responsibility for the Muthanna Province, as part of the Multinational force in Iraq. On 1 June 2004, the Dutch government renewed their stay through 2005. The Netherlands pulled its troops out of Iraq in March 2005, leaving half a dozen liaison officers until late 2005. The Netherlands lost two soldiers in separate attacks.

From 2015 until the spring of 2018, Dutch special operations forces (KCT and NLMARSOF) deployed advice and assist (A&amp;A) teams to northern Iraq in co-operation with the Belgian Special Forces Group. During this deployment, they provided support to Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi Army forces before, during and after operations in the battle against ISIL, as part of the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. The Netherlands currently deploy approximately 60 troops to Iraq.

====Afghanistan====
Between 2001 and 2003, a reinforced army company was deployed to Afghanistan to provide support in maintaining public order, and providing security in and around the capital Kabul. In addition, military assistance was provided to the Afghan National Army and to local security troops. The troops were deployed under the command of NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force mission.

Between 2006 and 2010, the Netherlands deployed personnel to southern Afghanistan. Together with the Australian armed forces, Dutch forces were assigned the province of Uruzgan as their area of operations. In mid-2006, Dutch special forces of the Korps Commandotroepen as part of the Deployment Task Force successfully deployed to Tarin Kowt to lay the ground for the increasing numbers of engineers who were due to build a base there. By August 2006 the Netherlands had deployed the majority of 1,400 troops to Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan at Multi National Base Tarin Kot (Kamp Holland) in Tarin Kowt (1,200) and Kamp Hadrian in Deh Rahwod (200). PzH 2000 self-propelled artillery pieces were deployed and used in combat for the first time. The Dutch forces operated under the command of the ISAF Task Force Uruzgan and were involved in some of the more intensive combat operations in southern Afghanistan, including Operation Medusa and the Battle of Chora. On 18 April 2008, the second day of his command, the son of the Commander of the Royal Netherlands Army Lieutenant-general Peter van Uhm, Lieutenant Dennis van Uhm, was one of two servicemen killed by a road side explosion. As of 1 September 2008, the Netherlands had a total of 1,770 troops in Afghanistan excluding special forces troops. In total, 25 Dutch servicemen were killed in action during the deployment. All Dutch troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan by August 2010.

Since 2015, 160 Dutch troops from the Korps Commandotroepen (rotated with NLMARSOF) and multiple support elements are deployed to the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif as part of NATO&#x27;s Resolute Support Mission. Dutch troops co-operate with personnel of the German Kommando Spezialkräfte as part of the German-Dutch lead Special Operations Advisory Team (SOAT). The SOAT provides advice and assistance during operations to an Afghan police tactical unit, the Afghan Territorial Force-888 (ATF-888). The SOAT has been granted authority to deploy in the entirety of Afghanistan.

====Mali====

Special forces of the Korps Commandotroepen have been deployed to Mali since 2014 as part of the UN-mission MINUSMA. The primary task of the Dutch forces has been to gather intelligence concerning local Islamist groups and to protect the people of Mali against radical Islamist groups. Since 2016, personnel of 11th Airmobile Brigade and 13th Light Brigade have been included in rotations. On 6 July 2016, two servicemen of 11 Airmobile Brigade were killed during a mortar firing exercise, a third serviceman was severely wounded. The incident lead to the resignation of the minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and Chief of Defence Tom Middendorp after a critical report by the Dutch Safety Board found that the safety-standards were subpar. The Netherlands have ended their troop contribution to the peacekeeping mission in May 2019 to send troops to Afghanistan instead.

====Lithuania====
The cabinet of the Netherlands announced in 2016 that the Netherlands would contribute troops to the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence mission in Lithuania to protect and reassure countries on NATO&#x27;s eastern flank—Baltic countries and Poland in particular—of their security following increased political tensions sparked by the Russo-Ukrainian War. The Dutch contribution currently equates to approximately 270 troops, integrated into a multinatinational battle group that is headed by Germany. Each rotation is composed of armoured infantry companies equipped with CV9035NL IFVs and Boxer AFVs, or artillery batteries equipped with PzH 2000NL self-propelled howitzers.

==Structure==
The core fighting element of the army consists of three brigades: 11 Airmobile Brigade, 13 Light Brigade and 43 Mechanised Brigade. The number of full-time professional personnel is 21,225, in addition to around 4,046 reservists. The Royal Netherlands Army is a volunteer force; compulsory military service has not been abolished but has been suspended. The other three services, (the Royal Netherlands Navy, Royal Netherlands Air Force and Royal Marechaussee), are fully volunteer forces as well.
* Land Forces Headquarters, in Utrecht
** 11 Airmobile Brigade, in Schaarsbergen
** 13 Light Brigade, in Oirschot
** 43 Mechanised Brigade, in Havelte
** Korps Commandotroepen, in Roosendaal
** 1 (GE/NL) Corps, in Münster (Germany)
** Joint Ground-based Air Defence Command, in Vredepeel
** Operational Support Command Land, in Apeldoorn
** Army Materiel Logistic Command, in Utrecht
** Education and Training Command, in Amersfoort

== Traditions ==
Besides the hierarchical organisation, the Royal Netherlands Army upholds a traditional organisation in which a distinction exists between arms of services. This organisation is purely ceremonial. Generally speaking, combat and combat support units are organised in arms, and support units are organised in services. There are two exceptions: the Engineers and the Signals Service.

The arms and services can in turn be further divided into one, or multiple regiments. These administrative organisations safeguard the traditions of the operational units. Before the Second World War, regiments were merely given a number, with the exception of the and regiments. Since the 1950s however, the regiments were given a historical name. The function of a regiment is strictly ceremonial, and is intended to increase &quot;esprit de corps&quot;.

=== Arms ===
The Royal Netherlands Army consists of the following arms, and subsequent regiments and corps:

==== Infantry ====
Each infantry regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army consists of a single battalion. The current order of battle includes a total of seven infantry battalions – of these, two are classed as foot guards and the remainder as line infantry.

The staff support companies of 11 Airmobile Brigade, 13 Light Brigade and 43 Mechanised Brigade are part of the , the and , respectively.

====Cavalry====
The cavalry arm currently consists of two active regiments – the and the . One has responsibility for the army&#x27;s active reconnaissance units, while the other has been formed as the parent regiment for units equipped with main battle tanks (MBTs).

Prior to 2012, the army also included full armoured regiments equipped with MBTs. One of these, the , was disbanded in 2007 due to budget cuts. The other two, the (former 1st Hussar Regiment) and the (former 2nd Hussar Regiment) were disbanded, along with the army&#x27;s full armoured capability, in 2012 as a result of further cuts to the Dutch defence budget.

In 2016, a German armoured unit, 414 Panzer Battalion, was attached to the Dutch 43 Mechanised Brigade, at the same time becoming a combined German-Dutch unit, with one of the three tank companies and part of the staff and support companies manned with Dutch troops.

===Services===
The services () consist of the logistical service, which comprises four regiments, and four stand-alone support services. The Royal Netherlands Army consists of the following services and regiments:

==Uniforms==
The Royal Netherlands Army uniform has multiple categories, ranging from ceremonial uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. In addition, the (special) service dress uniform and mess dress uniform can both be worn in a tropics colourway.

There are four main uniform categories:
; Combat uniform
The combat uniform () is the day-to-day combat uniform, known as (GVT M93) and consists of a Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) jacket and trousers with additional items such as thermals and waterproofs that can be worn underneath. Army combat uniforms are fitted with a distinctive unit insignia on the right arm, while the Dutch flag and the wearer&#x27;s regiment or corps are worn on the left arm. To optimise the effectiveness of the uniform, multiple camouflage patterns are in use:
* Woodland: Further developed version of the British Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) camouflage pattern. Optimised for use in wooded terrain in Western Europe and the standard pattern for personnel in the Netherlands.
* Desert: Increasing amount of deployments in desert like environments, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, lead to the implementation of the Desert combat uniform. The desert combat uniform uses the regular combat uniform, while using the American Desert Camouflage Pattern.
* Jungle: The jungle combat uniform utilises the regular combat uniform, in a five-coloured camouflage pattern which is optimised for deployments in tropical environments. The jungle uniform is often used by personnel undergoing jungle training, and units stationed in the Dutch Caribbean.
* MultiCam: Since the regular combat uniform no longer always qualifies for contemporary operations, personnel deploying to foreign countries is provided with interim combat uniforms in the MultiCam camouflage pattern. In addition, the Korps Commandotroepen has implemented uniforms in MultiCam as their standard uniform since 2017. Regular units use the interim uniforms until combat clothing in the newly developed Netherlands Fractal Pattern is distributed, between 2020 and 2022.

; Service dress uniform
The service dress uniform () is used for everyday office, barracks and non-field duty purposes. The uniform was designed by the famous couturier Frans Molenaar and entered service in 2000. It consists of trousers, a jacket, dress shirt, neck tie and headgear (beret, peaked cap or side cap), in a gray-green fabric. The special dress uniform () is worn for certain formal occasions. It consists of the garments of the service dress uniform, differing by the white dress shirt, black neck tie, white gloves, decorations worn in Prussian arrangement, while officers wear an orange sash around the waist.

; Mess dress uniform
The mess dress uniform () is worn during formal occasions, such as a dinner or a ball and consists of a black smoking, complemented with a peaked cap and miniature medals.

; Full dress uniform
Each regiment and corps within the army has its own full dress uniform (), which is a traditional uniform that is worn during ceremonies and special occasions.

==Military bands==

In past eras, music was used as a means of communication on the battlefield, and today military music retains an important role during military ceremonies such as enlistments and changes of command, and national events such as and the annual Remembrance of the Dead ceremony on 4 May. In addition, military bands provide the musical accompaniment during the presentation of letters of credence. Currently, there are four active military bands and fanfare orchestras within the Royal Netherlands Army:
* Royal Military Band &quot;Johan Willem Friso&quot;
* National Reserve Corps Fanfare Brass
* Regimental Fanfare Orchestra of the Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles&#x27; Guards 
* Fanfare Orchestra &quot;Bereden Wapens&quot; of the RNA Cavalry

==Colours and standards==

All regiments and corps are granted a colour () or standard (), including (since 2002) the artillery corps, which at the time was a breach with tradition. The colours and standards form the embodiment of the history and character of the respective regiment or corps. The standards are smaller in size because of a historical reason: horseback units would often struggle with the large sized poles of the regular colours, and therefore chose to wield a shorter version. To this day, the mounted units of the Royal Netherland Army, such as cavalry, field artillery and horse artillery, use the smaller sized standards. The Royal Marechaussee, which used to be a mounted unit of the Royal Netherlands Army, owns a standard as well.

In contrast to the functional use of colours and standards in the past, during which they served as landmarks on the battlefield, their contemporary role has been greatly reduced. Nonetheless, they continue to play an important role during various military ceremonies. For example, soldiers swear the oath of enlistment while holding the respective colour or standard. Moreover, the colours and standards constitute an important connection between military units and the Royal House of the Netherlands. Only the sovereign can grant a military unit a colour or standard, therefore the royal cypher of the monarch that granted the regiment its (original) colour is displayed. In addition, the colours and standards are often inscribed with (historical) battle honours. By prominently displaying them, the aim is to add to the &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, uphold the collective memory and serve as inspiration for future actions of the respective unit.

==Ranks and insignia==

The ranks of the Royal Netherlands were established by royal decree of Queen Juliana in 1956. Each regiment and corps has a distinctive cap badge and beret. Many units also call soldiers of different ranks by different names, for example a NATO OR-1 private is called a hussar () in cavalry regiments and a cannoneer () in artillery units.

===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
=== Royal Insignia ===
The Rank insignia worn by the Monarch of the Netherlands when wearing Royal Netherlands Army uniform.
== Equipment ==
=== Infantry ===
The Royal Netherlands Army&#x27;s basic weapon is the Colt C7NLD or Colt C8NLD assault rifle, produced by Colt Canada (formerly Diemaco). The weapons received an extensive update in 2009: the rifle&#x27;s black furniture was replaced by dark earth furniture. New parts include a new retracting stock, the Diemaco IUR with RIS rails for mounting flashlights and laser systems, and a vertical foregrip with built-in bipod; the thermold plastic magazines have now become brown in color. The ELCAN sighting system has also disappeared in favour of the Swedish made Aimpoint CompM4 red dot sight. In addition, the weapon can be enhanced further using the Picatinny rail with attachments such as the Heckler &amp; Koch UGL under-barrel grenade launcher. Special operations forces of the Korps Commandotroepen choose to use modified HK416 assault rifles and HK417 designated marksman rifles. The standard secondary weapon across all branches of the Armed forces of the Netherlands is the Austrian-made Glock 17 pistol.

Sniper groups () are equipped with HK417, Accuracy International Arctic Warfare Magnum, its successor Accuracy International AXMC, and Barrett M82 sniper rifles. Support fire is provided by the FN Minimi light machine gun (LMG), the FN MAG general purpose machine gun (GPMG), FN M2 QCB heavy machine gun (HMG) and the H&amp;K GMG automatic grenade launcher, while indirect fire support is provided by M6 60mm or L16 81mm mortars.

=== Armor ===
The army&#x27;s main battle tank is the Leopard 2A6. These MBT&#x27;s have been leased from the German army. The Swedish-made CV90 (designated as CV9035NL) is the infantry fighting vehicle of the army, supported on the battlefield by Boxer MRAV armoured fighting vehicles. Reconnaissance units use the light armoured Fennek reconnaissance vehicle.

In early September 2024 the new Dutch government announced that it would buy at least 46 (excl. 6 options) of the new Leopard 2A8 MBT&#x27;s for a full Tank Battalion. These tanks would operate alongside the leased Leopard 2A6 MBT&#x27;s from Germany. The last government also wanted to buy new tanks, but their defense budget didn&#x27;t allow it, but now with the new government the defense budget was risen to at least 2% of GDP. 

=== Artillery and air defence ===
The Fire Support Command currently operates two artillery systems: three batteries equipped with Pantserhouwitser 2000NL self-propelled howitzers and one battery equipped with 120mm Rayé Tracté heavy mortars. Air defence is provided by the modernised MIM-104 Patriot long-range air defence system operated by the Joint Ground-based Air Defence Command. Both the PAC-2 surface-to-air missile and PAC-3 anti-ballistic missile are in use. In addition, army personnel operate NASAMS 2 medium-range surface-to-air missiles, Fennek Stinger Weapon Platforms, and Hensoldt radar systems. These systems are operated combinedly in the Army Ground Based Air Defence System (AGBADS).

=== (Protected) mobility ===
For environments that require protection against Small Arms and Light Weapons and improvised explosive devices, the army uses the Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle. The Ministry of Defence has recently placed an order for 1,175 new medium multirole protected vehicles, the Iveco Medium Tactical Vehicle. The newly developed vehicles are due to commence entering service in early 2023. Multiple versions of the Mercedes-Benz Geländewagen are in use across the army, including light armoured combat versions such as the G280 CDI. The Volkswagen Amarok has replaced a large portion of the Mercedes-Benz fleet that was used for day-to-day utility work and peace time operations. Special operations forces (SOF) operate the Dutch-made Defenture VECTOR which is tailor-made for special operations.

=== Engineers and utility ===
Engineer regiments employ several specialist engineering vehicles based on Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks such as the Buffel armoured recovery vehicle, the Leguaan armoured vehicle-launched bridge and the Kodiak combat engineering vehicle. The army employs a variety of (logistical) utility vehicles, including four-, six-, ten- and fifteen-tonne trucks, mainly produced by DAF and Scania. Electronic warfare and CBRN defence units operate the TPz Fuchs armoured personnel carrier. In addition, during operations that require a high degree of mobility, army personnel have access to Luchtmobiel Speciaal Voertuig, KTM motorcycles and Suzuki quads.

=== Unmanned vehicles ===
Multiple types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are operational within the army. This includes the Black Hornet Nano, AeroVironment RQ-11B DDL Raven, Boeing Insitu ScanEagle, AeroVironment Wasp III, AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma and Boeing Insitu RQ-21 Blackjack UAVs. A large share of UAVs are operated by the 107 Aerial Systems Battery of the Joint ISTAR Command. In addition, the Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) unit of 13 Light Brigade experiments with and operates various unmanned ground vehicles, including the THeMIS produced by Milrem Robotics and the Mission Master of Rheinmetall.

<doc id="1154872" wikidata="Q7810696" url="?curid=1154872" title="Tlahuelpuchi">
<text>Belief in the bloodsucker Tlahuelpuchi is prominent in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala, with deep roots amongst the indigenous Nahua culture of the region.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;tlahuelpuchi&quot; derives from the Nahuatl &quot;tlāhuihpochtli&quot; (plural &quot;tlātlāhuihpochtin&quot;), a compound of &quot;tlāhuia&quot;, &quot;to light up or illuminate&quot; and &quot;pōchtli&quot;, which can mean &quot;haze&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;southern&quot; or &quot;youth&quot; (as in compounds like &quot;tēlpōchtli&quot;, young man). As a result, &quot;tlahuelpuchi&quot; may mean &quot;glowing haze&quot; or &quot;illuminated youth&quot;.

==Description==

The tlahuelpuchi is a type of vampire or witch that lives with its human family. It is able to shape shift and sucks the blood of infants at night. It has a kind of glowing aura when shape shifted. Tlahuelpuchi are born with their curse and cannot avoid it. They first learn of what they are sometime around puberty. Most tlahuelpuchi are female and the female tlahuelpuchi are more powerful than males. The tlahuelpuchi have a form of society. Typically they each have their own territories. They also have a pact with shamans and other supernatural creatures; a shaman won&#x27;t turn in a suspected tlahuelpuchi. The typical sign that a victim was killed by the tlahuelpuchi are bruises on their upper body. The Tlahuelpuchi largely feeds on children, though it can kill others.

==Powers==

Tlahuelpuchi are able to change form by detaching their body from their legs (which are left in the house of the witch). They then go hunting, usually in the form of some bird like a turkey or a vulture. The tlahuelpuchi has to perform a ritual before she can enter the house of a victim. The tlahuelpuchi must fly over the house in the shape of a cross from north to south, east to west.

==Weaknesses==

Tlahuelpuchi must feast on blood at least once a month or they die. Their victim of choice is an infant. There is no way to detect a tlahuelpuchi except by catching them in the act. Their family protects them out of shame and because if a family member is responsible for the death of a tlahuelpuchi the curse will be passed down to them. The curse cannot be lifted, and if a tlahuelpuchi is identified, they must be killed on the spot. Garlic, onions and metal repel the tlahuelpuchi.

<text>Nicholas Eveleigh ( – April 16, 1791) was an American planter and political leader who was a delegate to the Continental Congress for South Carolina in 1781 and 1782.

==Early life==
Eveleigh was born in Charleston, Province of South Carolina about 1748. He and his parents moved to Bristol, England around 1755. He remained there until 1774, although he conducted some business related to family property from London. Then he returned to South Carolina where he made his home for the rest of his life.

==Career==
In the Revolutionary War, Eveleigh first joined the 2nd South Carolina Regiment as a captain on June 17, 1775. After he participated in the defense of Fort Moultrie on June 28, 1776, he was promoted to colonel. He later served as the deputy Adjutant General for the Continental Army for South Carolina and Georgia. He resigned on August 24, 1778.

Eveleigh was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1781. Later that year, they sent him as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. In 1782, he returned home and served as a member of the State&#x27;s Council (later called the state senate) in 1783. He left public service for a time, and worked to improve his plantation.

On September 11, 1789 Eveleigh became the first Comptroller of the United States Treasury, under President George Washington.

==Personal life==
Eveleigh and his wife, Mary, had no children. She survived him and later remarried, to become the second wife of widower Edward Rutledge.

==Death==
Eveleigh died in office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 16, 1791. Washington appointed Oliver Wolcott Jr. to replace him.

<text>William Martin Sveinson (July 7, 1946 – December 17, 2020) was a Canadian professional poker player and politician. Sveinson served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in Saskatchewan. He was first elected under the Conservatives in 1982 and represented the riding of Regina North West.

Sveinson crossed the floor in 1983 and was, for a time, the only Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, but he was ousted from the party in 1985 as a result of apparent disagreements between Sveinson and Ralph Goodale (then leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal party) over legislative questioning tactics.

Oral questions during question period were a tactic used by opposition members to question the government. An oversight allowed Sveinson to continue with his oral questioning preventing an orderly closure to question period thus stopping the business of the house. The rules allowed question period to continue indefinitely. The purpose was to force the government to settle with constituents who had financial promises from the provincial government unfulfilled.

Sveinson continued to sit as an independent MLA until he joined the Western Canada Concept Party of Saskatchewan in 1986. The WCC had no members in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan at that time. The WCC advocated the separation from Canada of the four western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba).

He subsequently convinced Progressive Conservative MLA, Lloyd Hampton to join him in Opposition. This gave the WCC two seats in the legislature, enough to receive official party standing, and therefore a research budget paid for by the Legislature. Official party status gave the two members research funding to provide effective opposition. Subsequently, the rules were changed to prevent future use of this tactic.

The WCC was split over whether to accept the two new members: the party leader supported accepting them, while the party president was opposed. After a few months, Sveinson and Hampton were expelled from the party.

His political tenure ended with the 1986 provincial election. Sveinson died on December 17, 2020.

He also produced &quot;Triśaṣṭi-śalākā-puruṣacarita&quot; (“Deeds of the 63 Illustrious Men”), a Sanskrit epic poem on the history of important figures of Jainism. Later when he was consecrated as ācārya, his name was changed to Hemacandra.

==Early life==
Hemacandra was born in Dhandhuka, in present-day Gujarat, on Kartika Sud Purnima (the full moon day of Kārtika month). His year of birth differs according to sources but 1088 is generally accepted. His father, Cāciga was a Moḍha Bania. His mother, Pāhini, was a Jaina. Hemacandra&#x27;s birth name was Caṅgadeva. In his childhood, the Jaina monk Devacandra Sūri visited Dhandhuka and was impressed by the young Hemacandra&#x27;s intellect. His mother and maternal uncle concurred with Devachandra, in opposition to his father, that Hemacandra be a disciple of his. Devachandra took Hemacandra to Khambhat, where Hemacandra was placed under the care of the local governor Udayana. Cāciga came to Udayana&#x27;s place to take his son back, but was so overwhelmed by the kind treatment he received, that he decided to willingly leave his son with Devachandra.

Some years later, Hemacandra was initiated a Jaina monk on Magha Śukla Chaturthī (4th day of the bright half of Magha month) and was given a new name, Somacandra. Udayana helped Devacandra Suri in the ceremony. He was trained in religious discourse, philosophy, logic and grammar and became well versed in Jaina and non–Jaina scriptures. At the age of 21, he was ordained an acārya of the Śvētāmbara school of Jainism at Nagaur in present-day Rajasthan. At this time, he was named Hemacandra Suri.

==Hemacandra and Siddharaja==

At the time, Gujarat was ruled by the Chaulukya dynasty from Aṇahilavāda (Patan). It is not certain when Hemacandra visited Patan for the first time. As Jain monks are mendicants for eight months and stay at one place during Chaturmas, the four monsoon months, he started living at Patan during these periods and produced the majority of his works there.

Probably around 1125, he was introduced to Jayasiṃha Siddharāja (fl. 1092–1141) and soon rose to prominence in the Caulukya royal court. According to the &quot;Prabhavakacarita&quot; of Prabhācandra, the earliest biography of Hemacandra, Jayasiṃha spotted Hemacandra while passing through the streets of his capital. The king was impressed with an impromptu verse uttered by the young monk.

In 1135, when Siddharāa conquered Malwa, he brought the wmanuscripts f Bhoja from Dhaā aalong with other things. One day Siddhraaāa came across the manuscript of &quot;SarasvatiīKanṇṭaāharanṃ&quot; (also known as the &quot;Lakshana Prakash&quot;), a treatise on Sanskrit grammar. He was so impressed by it that he told the scholars in his court to produce a grammar that was as easy and lucid. Hemacandra requested Siddharaāa to find the eight best grammatical treatises from Kashmir. He studied them and produced a new grammar work in the style of Pāṇini&#x27;s &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot;. He named his work &quot;Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana&quot; after himself and the king. Siddharaāa was so pleased with the work that he ordered it to be placed on the back of an elephant and paraded through the streets of AnṇaiīwdvāḍaPatan. Hemacandra also composed the &quot;Dvyasśaya Kāvya&quot;, an epic on the history of the Chaulukya dynasty, to illustrate his grammar.

==Hemacandra and Kumārapāla==

According to the &quot;Prabhācandra&quot;, there was an incident where Siddharāja wanted to kill his nephew Kumarāpala because it was prophesied that the kingdom would meet its demise at Kumarapāla&#x27;s hands. Hemacandra hid Kumarapāla under a pile of manuscripts to save him. However, such motifs are common in Indian folk literature, so it is unlikely it was an actual historical event. Also, many sources differ on Siddharāja&#x27;s motives.

Hemacandra became the advisor to Kumārapāla. During Kumarapala&#x27;s reign, Gujarat became a center of culture. Using the Jaina approach of &quot;Anekantavada&quot;, Hemacandra is said to have displayed a broad-minded attitude, which pleased Kumārapāla. Kumārapāla was a Shaiva and ordered the rebuilding of Somnath at Prabhas Patan. Some Hindu saints who were jealous of Hemacandra&#x27;s rising popularity with the Kumārapāla complained that Hemacandra was a very arrogant person, that he did not respect the vedic deities and that he refused to bow down to Hindu God Shiva. When called upon to visit the temple on the inauguration with Kumārapāla, Hemacandra readily bowed before the lingam but said:

Ultimately, the king became a devoted follower of Hemacandra and a champion of Jainism.

Starting in 1121, Hemacandra was involved in the construction of the Jain temple at Taranga. His influence on Kumārapāla resulted in Jainism becoming the official religion of Gujarat and animal slaughter was banned in the state. The tradition of animal sacrifice in the name of religion was completely uprooted in Gujarat. As a result, even almost 900 years after Hemacandra, Gujarat still continues to be a predominantly lacto-vegetarian state, despite having an extensive coastline.

==Death==
He announced about his death six months in advance and fasted in his last days, a Jaina practice called &quot;sallekhana&quot;. He died at Aṇahilavāḍa Patan. The year of death differs according to sources but 1173 is generally accepted.

==Works==

A prodigious writer, Hemacandra wrote grammars of Sanskrit and Prakrit, poetry, prosody, lexicons, texts on science and logic and many branches of Indian philosophy.

===Jain philosophy===

His systematic exposition of the Jain path in the Yogaśāstra and its auto-commentary is a very influential text in Jain thought. According to Olle Quarnström it is &quot;the most comprehensive treatise on Śvetāmbara Jainism known to us&quot;.

===Grammar===

The &quot;Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāśana&quot; includes six languages: Sanskrit, the &quot;standard&quot; Prakrit (virtually Mahārāṣṭrī Prākrit), Śaurasenī, Māgadhī, Paiśācī, the otherwise-unattested Cūlikāpaiśācī and Apabhraṃśa (virtually Gurjar Apabhraṃśa, prevalent in the area of Gujarat and Rajasthan at that time and the precursor of Gujarati language). He gave a detailed grammar of Apabhraṃśa and also illustrated it with the folk literature of the time for better understanding. It is the only known Apabhraṃśa grammar. He wrote the grammar in form of rules, with 8 Adhyayas (Chapters) and its auto-commentraries namely – &quot;Tattvaprakāśikā Bṛhadvṛtti&quot; with &quot;Śabdamahārṇava Nyāsa&quot; in one year. Jayasimha Siddharaja had installed the grammar work in Patan&#x27;s (historically Aṇahilavāḍa) state library. Many copies were made of it, and many schemes were announced for the study of the grammar. Scholars like Kākala Kāyastha were invited to teach it. Moreover, an annual public examination was organized on the day of Jñāna-pañcamī. Kielhorn regards this as best grammar of Indian middle ages.

===Politics===
In 1125, he became an adviser to Kumārapāla and wrote the &quot;Arhannīti&quot;, a work on politics from a Jain perspective.

===Poetry and Poetics===
To illustrate the grammar, he produced the epic poetry &quot;Dvyāśraya Kāvya&quot; on the history of Chaulukya dynasty. It is an important source of history of region of the time. The epic poem &quot;Triṣaṣṭi-śalākā-puruṣa-caritam&quot; or &quot;Lives of Sixty-Three Great Men&quot; is a hagiographical treatment of the twenty four Tīrthaṅkaras and other important persons instrumental in defining the Jain philosophical position, collectively called the &quot;śalākāpuruṣa&quot;, their asceticism and eventual liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth, as well as the legendary spread of the Jaina influence. It still serves as the standard synthesis of source material for the early history of Jainism. The appendix to this work, the &quot;Pariśiṣṭaparvan&quot; or &quot;Sthavirāvalīcarita&quot;, contains accounts of the ācārya tradition starting from Jambūsvāmī. It has been translated into English as &quot;The Lives of the Jain Elders&quot;. In the test, Hemachandra accepts the polyandry of Draupadi and further suggests that Draupadī was Nāgaśrī in one of her previous lives and had poisoned a Jaina monk. Therefore, she had to suffer in hell and animal incarnations for several lives before being born as woman who later became a Jaina nun. After her death, she was reborn as Draupadī and was married to five Pāṇḍavas. 

His &quot;Kāvyānuśāsana&quot; follows the model of Kashmiri rhetorician Mammaṭa&#x27;s &quot;Kāvya-Prakāśa&quot;. He has authored a commentary called &quot;Alaṅkāracūḍāmaṇi&quot; and annotation called &quot;Viveka&quot;. He has quoted other scholars like Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta in his works. 

=== Lexicography ===
&quot;Abhidhānacintāmaṇi&quot; is a &quot;Saṃskṛta&quot; lexicon while &quot;Anekārthakoṣa&quot; is a lexicon of words bearing multiple meanings. &quot;Deśīnāmamālā&quot; is the lexicon of local or non-Sanskrit origin. &quot;Nighaṇṭu Śeṣa&quot; is a botanical lexicon.

===Prosody===
He composed the &quot;Chandonuśāsana&quot;, a work on prosody, with commentary.

===Mathematics===

Hemacandra, following the earlier Gopala, described the Fibonacci sequence in around 1150, about fifty years before Fibonacci (1202). He was considering the number of cadences of length &quot;n&quot;, and showed that these could be formed by adding a short syllable to a cadence of length &quot;n&quot; − 1, or a long syllable to one of &quot;n&quot; − 2. This recursion relation &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1) + &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 2) is what defines the Fibonacci sequence.

He () studied the rhythms of Sanskrit poetry. Syllables in Sanskrit are either long or short. Long syllables have twice the length of short syllables. The question he asked is How many rhythm patterns with a given total length can be formed from short and long syllables?
For example, how many patterns have the length of five short syllables (i.e. five &quot;beats&quot;)? There are eight: SSSSS, SSSL, SSLS, SLSS, LSSS, SLL, LSL, LLS. As rhythm patterns, these are xxxxx, xxxx., xxx.x, xx.xx, x.xxx, xx.x., x.xx., x.x.x 

===Other works===
His other works include a commentary in rhetoric work called &quot;Pramana-Mīmāṃsā (&quot;a work on logic and epistemology), &quot;Vitaraga-Stotra&quot; (praise of Jina).

<text>Carlos Manuel Hermosillo Goytortúa (born 24 August 1964) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is also known as &quot;El Grandote de Cerro Azul&quot; (&quot;The big tall one from Cerro Azul&quot;). He is the fifth all-time leading scorer of the Mexico national team with 34 goals.

==Career==
Hermosillo started his club career with América during the 1983–84 season. He spent most of his club career in his native Mexico, also playing for Monterrey, Cruz Azul, Necaxa, Atlante, and Chivas. Carlos&#x27; best two seasons as a player were in 1994–95 and 1995–96, when he scored 35 and 36 goals respectively for Cruz Azul.

Hermosillo made two stints of career football outside Mexico: Belgium&#x27;s Standard Liège in 1989–90 and Major League Soccer&#x27;s Los Angeles Galaxy in 1998–99. For Galaxy, he scored 14 goals and 15 assists in two regular seasons, adding five goals and an assist in the playoffs.

On 17 August 1986, he sparked an all-out war with Guadalajara&#x27;s Fernando Quirarte that included others from either side; he was suspended for 12 games.

Hermosillo was once the all-time goalscoring leader for the national team with 34 goals in official matches and 35 goals in all matches (90 caps between 1984 and 1997). He played in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, in which he could not use his favoured no. 27 jersey due to FIFA&#x27;s numbering rules for official competitions.

Since 1 December 2006, Carlos Hermosillo was named the minister of Mexico national sporting policy, &quot;Comisión Nacional del Deporte&quot; (National Commission for Sports). President Felipe Calderón included him in cabinet-level matters.

With an 18-year career with eight different clubs, Hermosillo retired. He last played with Guadalajara in 2001. He had a retirement game playing with Cruz Azul, his favorite team before professional play was Cruz Azul, also he won a championship with Cruz Azul in 1997.

<doc id="1154922" wikidata="Q6266982" url="?curid=1154922" title="Johnny Johnson (musical)">
<text>Johnny Johnson is a musical with a book and lyrics by Paul Green and music by Kurt Weill. It premiered in 1936 on Broadway.

Based on Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s 1921–1923 satiric novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;, the musical focuses on a naive and idealistic young man who, despite his pacifist views, leaves his sweetheart Minny Belle Tompkins to fight in Europe in World War I. He first tries to stop the war after meeting a young German sniper of the same name, who believes that the soldiers must unite. However, the commanders of the allied forces intend to use the discontent with the war among the German soldiers as a perfect time to advance in the war. Johnny then manages to bring the skirmish to a temporary halt by incapacitating a meeting of the generals with laughing gas, but once they recover they promptly reinstate the war, resulting in hundreds of thousands of fatalities. Meanwhile, Johnny finds himself committed to an for ten years. He returns home to discover Minny Belle has married a capitalist, and he settles down as a toymaker who will create anything except tin soldiers, his personal gesture of peace in an increasingly warlike society.

The musical was written and composed by Green and Weill during the summer of 1936 in a rented old house located in Nichols, Connecticut near the summer rehearsal headquarters of the Group Theatre at Pine Brook Country Club. Its title was inspired by the fact the name appeared on United States casualty rolls more often than any other.

==Productions and background==

Weill was asked to develop the project by the socially conscious Group Theatre, but much of his music was scrapped when original director Harold Clurman was replaced by Lee Strasberg, who opted to emphasize text over music. The Broadway production opened on November 19, 1936, at the 44th Street Theatre, where it ran for 68 performances. The cast included Russell Collins as Johnny and Phoebe Brand as Minny Belle, with Luther Adler, Morris Carnovsky, Lee J. Cobb, Curt Conway, John Garfield, Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis, and Sandy Meisner in supporting roles. It was the runner-up for Best American Play from the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award.

A 1956 production was presented Off-Broadway at the Little Carnegie Playhouse at Carnegie Hall. It was directed by Stella Adler and starred among others James Broderick as Johnny Johnson and Gene Saks as the Mad Psychiatrist. It ran from October 21, 1956, through October 28. Samuel Matlowsky was the musical director and conducted the 1956 record album which had none of the cast from the Stella Adler production.

After 10 previews, a revival directed by José Quintero and choreographed by Bertram Ross opened on April 11, 1971, at the Edison Theatre, where it closed after one performance. The cast included Ralph Williams as Johnny and Alice Cannon as Minny Belle.

The British premiere was staged by actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company in the &quot;Not the RSC Again&quot; festival at the Almeida Theatre, London in the Summer of 1986. There were no more than two performances of &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;, which was directed by Paul Marcus. The title role was taken by Graham Turner with Beverley Klein as Minny Belle. Other roles were played by Martin Milman, Clive Mantle, Tina Marian, Michael McNally, Keith Osborne, Geraldine Wright, Patrick Bailey, David Summer and Andrew Yeats. Musical director was John Owen Edwards.

In 2009, a concert-staging was mounted in London by the Discovering Lost Musicals Charitable Trust, with Max Gold in the title role.

The ReGroup Theatre Company staged two sold-out staged readings that were directed by Estelle Parsons at the 47th St Theatre, in New York on December 12, 2011. Johnny was played by Pete McElligott, and his performances was named one of the 10 memorable performances of 2011 by &quot;Backstage&quot;.

==Recordings==
A November 1956 studio recording (&quot;MGM Records&quot; MGM E 3447, later released on Heliodor, Polydor, and online at ArkivMusik.com) has Burgess Meredith as Johnny, Evelyn Lear as Minny Belle, and Hiram Sherman as the Mad Psychiatrist; smaller roles are taken by Jane Connell, Lotte Lenya, and Thomas Stewart, and the conductor is Samuel Matlowsky.

A November 1996 recording (Erato 0630-17870-2) offers Donald Wilkinson as Johnny, Ellen Santaniello as Minny Belle, and Paul Guttry as the Mad Psychiatrist; Joel Cohen conducts.

<text>Gruppe SPUR was an artistic collaboration formed by the German painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm, and Hans-Peter Zimmer, and the sculptor Lothar Fischer in 1957. They published a journal of the same name &quot;Spur&quot;.

&quot;Spur&quot; was subject to prosecution and was convicted &quot;in the name of moral order&quot;.

The Spur group joined and collaborated with the Situationist International, a restricted group of international revolutionaries, between 1959 and 1961. After a series of core divergences during 1960–1, the Spur members were officially excluded from the SI on February 10, 1962. The events that led to the exclusion were: during the Fourth SI Conference in London (December 1960), in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, Spur group disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a revolutionary proletariat; the accusation that their activities were based on a &quot;systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses&quot;; the fact that at least one Spur member, Lothar Fischer, and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to get success in the art market; and the betrayal of a common agreement on the Spur and SI publications. The exclusion was the recognition that the Spur group&#x27;s &quot;principles, methods and goals&quot; were significantly in contrast with those of the SI. This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of Judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to the Spur group, calling it the only significant artistic group in Germany since WW2, and at the level of the avant-gardes in other countries.

The SPUR artists met first at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich in Munich, Germany. They formed the group in 1957, which lasted until 1965.

==Censorship, police, and juridical persecutions==
Guy Debord remarked that while between 1920 and 1933 &quot;Germany incontestably had the highest rank in the elaboration of art and, more generally, the culture of our era&quot;, from the post-war era to 1960, &quot;Germany has been characterized by a total cultural void and by the dullest conformism&quot;. The Spur journal was a flourishing exception to such void and conformism, as it was, for the first time in decades, an artistic group that manifested a certain freedom of investigation, and as an &quot;extremely worrisome symptom&quot;, this group was almost immediately the object of police and juridical persecutions.
Helmet Sturim, Dieter Kunzelmann, Heimrad Prem and H.P. Zimmer each received 5 months in prison.
Debord noted that Western Europe and the Scandinavian countries, had another level of intellectual tolerance, that such a trial was, at that moment, unthinkable in Paris or Copenhagen. That clumsy affair had already harmed the reputation of the Federal German Republic. Debord asserted that the pretext by which the Spur group was brought to trial, was &quot;to make the Spur group, and all those who wish to pursue the same route, succumb to the ambient conformism.&quot; Debord ridiculed that trial to the prosecutions of Baudelaire and Flaubert for pornography and immorality in the 19th century France:

==Relations with the Situationist International==
The Spur group collaborated with the Situationist International, a restricted group of international revolutionaries, between 1959 and 1961, when the Spur members joined the SI. After a series of core divergences during 1960–1, the Spur members were officially excluded from the SI on February 10, 1962. After this, despite the two organizations having a &quot;sufficiently large objective opposition between their respective principles, methods, and goals,&quot; Guy Debord expressed esteem to Spur, considering it the highest expression of German art and culture of post WW2. However, after the exclusion and split, the two groups remained distinct and separated, and each was only responsible for its autonomous actions.

The first contact with Situationist International happened through Asger Jorn. Jorn, one of the most prominent members of the SI, discovered the SPUR-paintings at a gallery managed by art dealer Otto Van de Loo. Later on, the Spur members come to join and became members of the Situationist International, forming the majority of the members of the German section of the SI.

A major point of divergence came up from the Spur group during The Fourth SI Conference in London (December 1960). The discussion of a report by Attila Kotányi, leads to posing the question: &quot;To what extent is the SI a political movement?&quot; Various responses state that the SI is political, but not in the ordinary sense. The discussion becomes somewhat confusing. Debord proposes, to bring out the opinion of the Conference, that each person responds in writing to a questionnaire asking if he considers that there are &quot;forces in the society that the SI can count on? What forces? In what conditions?&quot; This questionnaire is agreed upon and filled out. When, a day later, the Spur members present a joint response to the questionnaire, in which they reject the concept of a proletarian revolution, it generates a sharp debate:

This position was critiqued by Debord, Nash, Kotányi, and Jorn. The majority of the S.I. seems to be against it, and the Spur members are asked to formalize their position so it can be brought to a vote. But, when the Spur group returned from their deliberation, they retract the preceding declaration. Debord starts to suspect that the Spur members were not understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas and that they were instead using the SI to get success in the art market. As a consequence, during the Fifth SI Conference held in Gothenburg, Sweden, 28–30 August 1961, Asger Jorn (signing himself as &quot;George Keller&quot;) proposed to unify the S.I. publications in the various countries (including &quot;Spur&quot;) as a single journal, to be translated in four editions in English, French, German and Swedish. The reaction of the Spur members to this proposal was mentioned in the conference report:

Despite Spur&#x27;s agreement to add Attila Kotányi and Jacqueline de Jong to the editorial committee of Spur, the following issue #7 was printed five months later without Kotányi and de Jong&#x27;s knowledge. Issue #7 featured considerable divergences with the SI ideas, marking a distinct regression from the preceding #5 and #6 issues. These events led the following month, February 1962, to the exclusion from the SI of those responsible.

The arguments for the exclusion, declared in a letter on February 10, 1962, were that &quot;fractional activity of this group is based on a systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses&quot;, that they were using the Situationists to succeed on the art market and that to achieve this they had &quot;perfectly disregarded the discipline of the S.I.&quot;. On the accusation of using the SI to &quot;arrive&quot; as artists, Spur member Dieter Kunzelmann admitted that it applied for sure to Lothar Fischer, but rejected that it was true for the other Spur members present at the Fifth SI Conference in Gothenburg.

<doc id="1154931" wikidata="Q189236" url="?curid=1154931" title="Velletri">
<text>Velletri (; ; ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Rome, approximately 40 km to the southeast of the city centre, located in the Alban Hills, in the region of Lazio, central Italy. Neighbouring communes are Rocca di Papa, Lariano, Cisterna di Latina, Artena, Aprilia, Nemi, Genzano di Roma, and Lanuvio. Its motto is: (&#x27;Liberty of pope and empire is given to me&#x27;).

Velletri was an ancient city of the Volsci tribe. Legendarily it came into conflict with the Romans during the reign of Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome; then again in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, during the early Roman Republic. Velletri was also the home of the Octavii, the paternal family of the first Roman Emperor Augustus. In the Middle Ages, it was one of the few &quot;free cities&quot; in Lazio and central Italy. It was the site of two historic battles in 1744 and 1849. During the Second World War, it was at the centre of fierce fighting between the Germans and the allies in 1944 after the Anglo-American landing at Anzio.

Today, Velletri is home to a circuit court and a prison, in addition to several colleges and high schools. It is the terminus of the Rome-Velletri railway, inaugurated by Pius IX in 1863, and is one of the centers the Via Appia Nuova (modern Appian Way) passes through.

==Physical geography==

===Territory===
The territory of Velletri stretches between two distinct areas. The northern part is situated on the southern foothills of the Colli Albani range and was geologically formed about 150,000 years ago, after the collapse of the Volcano Laziale (caldera). On the other hand, the southern boundary forms around Pontine Marshes, whose reclamation started at the time of Pope Pius VI and was accomplished during the regime of Benito Mussolini.

According to the classification given by the Geological Survey of Italy, much of the territory consists of ground-type LPS, or paleosols, the rest is mainly composed of soils lp, lapilli, argillificate, Mafic, and leucite analcimizzata. 
The Seismic classification of Velletri&#x27;s territory is Zone 2 (medium-high seismicity).

===Hydrography===
The territory of Velletri collects water run off from many streams. These streams, most of them torrential in character or small in scale, are known as &quot;fossi&quot;. Main &quot;fossi&quot; include: 
*&quot;Fosso Minella&quot; at the edge of the municipal area to Genzano di Roma, near the Velletri &quot;frazione&quot; of Sant&#x27;Eurosia. This stream originates from Monte Spina, elevation above sea level, in the territory of Nemi, with the name of Acqua Lucia. It is named after the Minella bridge on State Road 7, Via Appia Nuova and originates at above sea level, at the foot of Colle degli Olmi. Minella also runs parallel to the fosso delle Tre Armi, which then connects to it.
*&quot;Fossa Sant&#x27;Eurosia&quot;, originating from Colle degli Olmi; it goes through the village of the same name, located at above sea level.
*&quot;Fossa Paganica&quot;, which originates from springs on Colle Caldaro (467 m), and on Colle Tondo (596 m).
*&quot;Fosso di Ponte Veloce&quot;, which arises from Colle Tondo, on Maschio dell&#x27;Artemisio (812 m) and in the Faccialone forest (615 m). This watercourse near Villa Borgia, superseded the old town of Velletri, changes name to Fossa Farina near the iron bridge of the Roma-Velletri railway.
*&quot;Fossa Anatolia&quot;: originating from Colle Bello (600 m), it flows at the foot of old town Velletri, until it joins the Fossa Farina.

Other water sources include the &quot;Acqua de Ferrari&quot;, at , underlying Monte de Ferrari ( above sea level) at Rocca di Papa, from which is part of the municipal water supply.

===Topography===
The old town&#x27;s altitude is substantially uniform from the elevation of Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi at 339 m above sea level, the square of the Trivium at above sea level, and Napoletana at above sea level. The area west of the walled city is a bit higher at San Lorenzo reaching above sea level. The remainder of the territory to the south and west is basically flat except for small hills that do not exceed above sea level.

===Climate===
The climate of Velletri is mild, due to the Tyrrhenian Sea not being far, and to the protection offered by the Alban Hills and Mount Artemisio in the north. The climate is very rainy, with an annual average of precipitation, making it the rainiest city of Lazio and one of the most rainy cities in Italy. Humid currents from the southwest facing the Mont Artemisio condense all the rain on Velletri, leaving clouds restricted to the northern side of the Colli Albani. It snows rarely.

==Etymology==
The Latin term for &quot;swamp&quot; was &quot;Velia&quot;, corresponding to the Greek &quot;ουελια&quot; ( &quot;Velia&quot;). From this root came the place name Velestrom, the place next to a swamp or marsh, was probably used by Volsci to call old Velletri. The Romans named it after the same city Velitrae, hence the Greek &quot;Ουελιτραι&quot; (&quot;Ouelitrai&quot;), &quot;Ουελιτρα&quot; (&quot;Ouelitra&quot;) or &quot;Βελιτρα&quot; (&quot;Belitra&quot;).

In the Middle Ages, at least six naming variants (Velletrum, Veletrum, Veletra, Velitrum, Bellitro, Villitria) are attested by various official acts until the 11th century. Until the 18th century, Velletri survived as parallel forms of Blitri and Belitri.

==History==
===Ancient===
During his reign (642–617 BC), Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome, came into conflict with the Volsci because the latter plundered Roman territory. He besieged the Velitrae, which was a Volscian town. The elders of the town surrendered and promised &quot;to make good the damage they had done&quot; and &quot;agreed to deliver up the guilty to be punished&quot;. Ancus Marcius &quot;concluded a treaty of peace and friendship&quot;.

In 494 BC, a war between Rome and the Volsci broke out. The Roman consul Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus was sent to fight the Volsci. He defeated them and &quot; pursued their enemies beyond it to Velitrae, where vanquished and victors burst into the city in one body. More blood was shed there, in the promiscuous slaughter of all sorts of people, than had been in the battle itself. A very few were granted quarter, having come without arms and given themselves up.&quot; The Volsci &quot;were deprived of the Veliternian land; colonists were sent from [Rome] to Velitrae and a colony was planted&quot;. In 492 BC, while the Volsci were affected by an epidemic, &quot;the Romans increased the number of colonists at Velitrae and sent out a new colony to Norba, in the mountains, as a stronghold for the Pomptine country&quot;, which was a Volscian area near Velitrae. According to Diodorus Siculus, &quot;the Romans increased the number of colonists in the city known as Velitrae&quot; in 404 BC.

In 385 BC, during another war between Rome and the Volsci, the Roman colonists from Circeii and Velitrae provided a contingent which fought alongside the Volsci. The Romans found out about this because there were men from Velitrae among the prisoners they captured in a battle they won against the Volsci. They were sent to Rome and questioned. This &quot;in no uncertain terms laid bare the defection of their respective peoples&quot;. The colonists sent envoys to Rome &quot;to clear themselves of the charge of joining in the Volscian war and to ask for the release of the captives, that they might punish them in accordance with their own laws&quot;. Their request was denied. They received a rebuke and an order to leave the city. In 382 BC two of the military tribunes with consular power for that year, Spurius and Lucius Papirius, marched on Velitrae. They won a battle near the town in which &quot;auxiliaries from Praeneste almost outnumbered the colonists&quot;. The enemy took refuge in the city and the tribunes &quot;abstained from attacking the place; they were not certain of succeeding, nor did they think it right to aim at the extermination of the colony&quot;.

In 380 BC the Romans stormed Velitrae and then moved on to fight other enemies. In 370 BC the colonists of Velitrae made several incursions into Roman territory and also besieged Tusculum. The Romans drove them form Tusculum and besieged Velitrae. The siege lasted until 367 BC when Marcus Furius Camillus, after defeating a force of Gauls which had encamped near Rome, captured the town, which surrendered without a struggle.

In 340 BC the Latin cities federated in the Latin League, which had been an ally of the Romans, rebelled in what had been called the Latin War (340-338 BC). They were joined by the Campanians, the Volsci and the Roman colonies of Signa and Velitrae. After two years of fighting Rome defeated the rebels. Velitrae was punished harshly. Her walls were demolished. Her senators were exiled beyond the River Tiber (that, is, they were interned in a foreign land; the Tiber was the border between Latium and Etruria). It was decreed that if a Veliternian senator crossed this river, &quot;his redemption should be set at a thousand pounds of bronze, and that he who had captured him might not release his prisoner from bondage until the fine was paid&quot;. The town was repopulated with colonists who were settled on the lands of the senators.

Livy recorded that in 332 BC new Roman citizens were assessed in the census of that year and registered into two new Roman tribes (local administrative districts where Roman citizens were registered). These two new Roman tribes were the Maecia and Scaptia. According to Cornell and Oakley, Velitrae and Lanuvium were incorporated into the Scaptia and Maecia respectively, thus obtaining Roman citizenship.

During the Roman period, several patricians built several villas in Velitrae. Inscriptions recorded that the city had a basilica, an amphitheater and a theater. Livy noted that the city had the shrines of the gods Apollo and Sangus. Velitrae was also a noted center for wine production. Suetonius wrote: &quot;There are many indications that the Octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at Velitrae; for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called Octavian, but an altar was shown there besides, consecrated by an Octavius. This man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town ...&quot; This was the family of Rome&#x27;s first emperor, Augustus. Augustus was born at the Ox Head, a small property on the Palatine Hill in Rome, but spent his childhood in Velitrae. Suetonius wrote that &quot;A small room like a pantry is shown to this day as the emperor&#x27;s nursery in his grandfather&#x27;s country-house near Velitrae, and the opinion prevails in the neighbourhood that he was actually born there.&quot;

===Medieval===
Velletri began to decline after it was sacked by Alaric the Goth in 410 CE. It was the seat of a bishopric and, in the following century, it became an imperial city after the Byzantine reconquest of Italy. The first information about Velletri in the Middle Ages is dated 465 by Adeodato, the bishop of the city. Between the 5th and 6th century, the Veliterna diocese became increasingly important. In 592, Pope Gregory I brought together the Diocese of Tres Tabernae in Velletri. 
In the 10th century, Velletri fell under the rule of the Counts of Tusculum (981). The entire area of the Alban Hills and the Monti Prenestini was dominated by the Counts of Tusculum, including the fortress of Lariano next to Velletri. In 1084, Robert Guiscard marched against Rome and passed through Velletri, meeting resistance from residents, who were rewarded by the Pope in 1101, with a Breve that gave very broad boundaries to the Veliterna community.
In the 13th century, Velletri was administered in the form of a republic. It was governed by the Great Council, composed of consuls, who were then replaced by a council of novemviri (nine men), a mayor with supervisory functions, constables who were military leaders, and a podestà who had judicial duties.

Pope Alexander IV (1254–1261), former bishop of Velletri, ordered during his pontificate to bring the relics of Velletri holy martyrs Pontian and Eleuterio to be preserved in the crypt beneath the cathedral. In 1342, Nicola Caetani besieged Velletri. However, the city resisted until the arrival of reinforcements from Rome. In exchange for this help, the city had to undergo the appointment of a mayor appointed by Rome. This kind of vassalage lasted until 1374 when, following an agreement, the Podestà would be elected every six months. The first four times the choice would be directly ratified by the Romans. In 1353 the Trivium Tower was opened. It was a symbol of the city of Velletri.
In 1408, Ladislaus of Naples occupied Velletri during his attempt to conquer the Papal States. In 1434, during the struggle against the Colonna and Savelli families, Pope Eugene IV razed the castle of Lariano with the assistance of 800 Velletrani soldiers. The land of Castellana was granted to Velletri, and remained merged with Velletri until 1967. On April 21, 1482, during the Salt War between Pope Sixtus IV and Ferdinand of Aragon 500 Velletrani soldiers, 250 of whom were considered to be among the best Italian archers, fought with the papal army of Roberto Malatesta in the Battle of Campomorto, in a marshy area next to the territory Velletri, now in the town of Aprilia. The Pope won and the Velletrani were rewarded for their faithfulness by the Holy See.

In 1512, Velletri was still an independent City-state. The city government was administered by the &quot;Priora&quot;, which had replaced the &quot;novemviri&quot;. In November 1526, a contingent from Velletri sent by Pope Clement VII contributed to the rainge the castle of Marino, a fiefdom of the Colonna family, who at the time were enemies of the Pope and allies of Spain. Following this, Ascanio Colonna, the lord of Marino, sacked Rome of May 7, 1527. The Pope was imprisoned in (Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo), forcing Velletri to pay 15,000 crowns in municipal lands, 12,600 crowns in installments, and provide more than 6,000 rubbia lime and 15,000 tiles to repair the damage done to Marino. Mercenaries of the Colonnas took up lots in Velletri. 
In 1589, Pope Sixtus V dissolved the civilian government, but Pope Gregory XIV ordered the reunification of the two powers (papal and civilian) in 1591, thus sealing the definitive end of the free municipality.

===Modern===
In the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the troops of the Spanish-Nepolitan Bourbons won the Battle of Velletri, fought against Austrian Habsburgs in Velletri and its surroundings.

After the French Revolution, Velletri rebelled and it was proclaimed a Republic. Later it changed sides and 900 of its citizens resisted in Castel Gandolfo the siege by Joachim Murat. The Republic lasted until 1814.

Garibaldi won a battle with the Bourbon Neapolitan force at Velletri, but the victory was short-lived as the Roman Republic was overwhelmed soon after this.

A telegraph line reached Velletri in 1856. In 1866, Pope Pius IX opened the Roma-Velletri railway, the third rail of the Papal States and one of the first in Italy. This helped the growth of the town even after the transition to the Kingdom of Italy.

In 1913, the Tramvie dei Castelli Romani tram line reached Velletri, connecting it directly to Rome and the rest of the Castelli Romani area until 1953. In 1927, the fascist regime instituted the National Grape and Wine Festival, which is still celebrated today in October.

in the last days of May 1944 Velletri was at the center of the conflict which followed the Anglo-American landing at Anzio (22 January 1944) during the Second World War. While the Gustav Line at Cassino and the Hitler Line at Pontecorvo were falling to the enemy the Germans created a third fortified line, the Caesar Line, which stretched between Torvaianica, Lanuvio, Velletri, Artena, and Valmontone. The First Division paratroopers of the Wehrmacht was stationed at Velletri. The U.S. General Mark Wayne Clark ordered the May 25 offensive against the Caesar line facing strong resistance. The 36th U.S. Infantry Division commanded by General Fred Walker spotted a flaw in the German defenses on Mount Artemisio between Velletri and Valmontone. Between 30 and 31 May 1944, the 142nd and 143rd regiments penetrated the German defenses at Monte Artemisio, and on June 1 Velletri fell, followed the next day by Valmontone and on 3 June by Lanuvio and Castelli Romani. Velletri and its most important monuments were virtually destroyed; the Tower of the Trivium at the Palazzo Comunale and Palazzo Ginnetti were never rebuilt. Despite the evacuation order of German military authorities, there were civilian casualties.

The rebuilding of Velletri continued despite a devolution in 1967 granted independent municipal status to Lariano. The Suburbicarian See of Velletri-Segni was created. New schools and cultural centers were built. The new seat of the Tribunal, the Cadets Battalion NCO of the Carabinieri, the Regiment of Cadets Brigadier Marshals, and new prison were established.

In 2000, the new library called Biblioteca Comunale Augusto Tersenghi was inaugurated. here were also the opening of the Teatro di Terra (1995), the reopening of the Ugo Tognazzi Theater and the restoration of the Civic Archaeological Museum and of the Diocesan Museum.

On 14 June 2001, Mario Pepe of the Chamber of Deputies presented a bill on the establishment of the province of the Castelli Romani with Velletri as its capital . In the proposal the following municipalities would be part of the new province: Albano Laziale, Anzio, Ardea, Ariccia, Artena, Carpineto Romano, Castel Gandolfo, Cave, Colleferro, Colonna, Gavignano, Genazzano, Genzano di Roma, Grottaferrata, Lanuvio, Lariano, Marino, Monte Compatri, Montelanico, Monte Porzio Catone, Nemi, Nettuno, Olevano Romano, Palestrina, Pomezia, Rocca di Papa, Rocca Priora, San Cesareo, San Vito Romano, Valmontone, Velletri, and Zagarolo. Velletri was chosen as the provincial capital because of its central position, which confirmed &quot;the role and the strategic importance of Velletri&quot;. The budget allocated to the province, once established, was 460 million lire. On 23 September 2007, Pope Benedict XVI, who as Cardinal Bishop had the title of Velletri-Segni, visited Velletri celebrating a Mass in Piazza San Clemente.

===Fortifications===

When Velletri was a Volscian town it was surrounded by massive walls. However, they were razed to the ground in 338 BC as a punishment after the final Roman conquest of the city. The walls were not rebuilt until the Middle Ages. 
In the Middle Ages, Velletri was surrounded by mighty castle walls which originally had six gates: &quot;Porta Fura, Porta del Pontone, Porta Santa Martina (o Portella), Porta Lucia, Porta Romana, and Porta Napoletana&quot;. In the 16th century, the city strengthened the walls by closing certain gates and keeping only three of them: &quot;Porta Lucia, Porta Napoletana, and Porta Romana&quot;. They were:

*&quot;Porta Napoletana&quot;, which was built in 1511 by laborers from Lombardy. It has survived virtually unscathed to this day and now houses the local branch of the AIS (Italian Sommelier Association).
*&quot;Porta Romana&quot; was rebuilt in 1573 to a design by Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola, near the bastions of the town. However, during extension works on the Appian Way, the gate was destroyed and was replaced by the &quot;blocco di Porta Romana&quot;, a customs post, and then the current Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi.

The War Memorial, designed by Emanuele Cannigia was inaugurated on June 2, 1927, in before King Victor Emmanuel III. It is located in a corner of Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi.

===Archaeological sites===
The Oreste Nardini Civic Archeological Museum of Velletri, has noteworthy works from protohistoric to the medieval period. The existence of a Roman amphitheatre in Velitrae is attested to by a curve in area adjacent to the Town Hall and an inscription found in the 1565.

The &quot;bronze sheets of Velletri&quot; were found within the structure of the Church of the St. Francis in 1784, and are kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.

The site of the Villa degli Ottavi, sub-urban residence of the gens Octavia and Augustus, the only Roman villa it the Velletri area, was identified outside the village of San Cesareo. Carefully excavated, the site shows evidence of a 15.05 x 13.20 m three-nave Roman cistern of the republican period. It is unique because it had pointed arches, and a mosaic. The area currently is private property. Another Roman cistern was discovered in 1982 along the ancient route of the Appian Way in Capanna Murata.

It is distinguished from neighboring dialects of the Castelli Romani area and the Roman dialect because it is more akin to the &quot;Central-Northern Lazian&quot; and &quot;Neapolitan&quot; dialect. The Veliterno dialect, is often unintelligible for those who do not normally speak Italian. It is characterized by a predominance of the vowel &quot;o&quot; and Neapolitan expressions such as &quot;nanny&quot; for a father, &quot;am dead&quot; for dead.

<doc id="1154940" wikidata="Q4725619" url="?curid=1154940" title="Sprat">
<text>Sprat is the common name applied to a group of forage fish belonging to the genus &quot;Sprattus&quot; in the family Clupeidae. The term also is applied to a number of other small sprat-like forage fish (&quot;Clupeoides&quot;, &quot;Clupeonella&quot;, &quot;Corica&quot;, &quot;Ehirava&quot;, &quot;Hyperlophus&quot;, &quot;Microthrissa&quot;, &quot;Nannothrissa&quot;, &quot;Platanichthys&quot;, &quot;Ramnogaster&quot;, &quot;Rhinosardinia&quot;, and &quot;Stolothrissa&quot;). Like most forage fishes, sprats are highly active, small, oily fish. They travel in large schools with other fish and swim continuously throughout the day.

They are recognized for their nutritional value, as they contain high levels of polyunsaturated fats, considered beneficial to the human diet. They are eaten in many places around the world. Sprats are sometimes passed off as other fish; products sold as having been prepared from anchovies (since the 19th century) and others sold as sardines sometimes are prepared from sprats, as the authentic ones once were less accessible. They are known for their smooth flavour and are easy to mistake for baby sardines.

==Species==
===True sprats===
True sprats belong to the genus &quot;Sprattus&quot; in the family Clupeidae. The five species are:


===Other sprats===
The term also is commonly applied to a number of other small sprat-like forage fish that share characteristics of the true sprat. Apart from the true sprats, FishBase lists another 48 species whose common names ends with &quot;sprat&quot;. Some examples are:

==Characteristics==
The average length of time from fertilization to hatching is about 15 days, with environmental factors playing a major role in the size and overall success of the sprat. The development of young larval sprat and reproductive success of the sprat have been largely influenced by environmental factors. Some of these factors affecting the sprat can be seen in the Baltic Sea, where specific gravity, water temperature, depth, and other such factors play a role in their success.

In recent decades the number of sprat has fluctuated, due primarily to availability of zooplankton, a common food source, and also from overall changes in Clupeidae total abundance. Although the overall survival rates of the sprat decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there has been a subsequent increase. Recent studies suggesting a progression in the reproductive success of the sprat acknowledge that a significant increase in spawning stock biomass occurred. One of the main concerns for reproductive success for the sprat include exceedingly cold winters, as cold temperatures, especially in the Baltic Sea, have been known to affect the development of sprat eggs and larvae.

The metabolic rate of the sprat is highly influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature. Several related fish, such as the Atlantic herring (&quot;C. harengus&quot;), have much lower metabolic rates than that of the sprat. Some of the difference may be due to size differences among the related species, but the most important reason for high levels of metabolism for the sprat is their exceedingly high level of activity throughout the day.

==Distribution==
Fish of the different species of sprat are found in various parts of the world including New Zealand, Australia, and parts of Europe. By far, the most highly studied location where sprat, most commonly &quot;Sprattus sprattus&quot;, reside is the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. The Baltic Sea provides the sprat with a highly diverse environment, with spatial and temporal potential allowing for successful reproduction.

One of the most well-known locations in the Baltic Sea where they forage for their food is the Bornholm Basin, in the southern portion of the Baltic Sea. Although the Baltic Sea has undergone several ecological changes during the last two decades, the sprat has dramatically increased in population. One of the environmental changes that has occurred in the Baltic Sea since the 1980s includes a decrease in water salinity, due to a lack of inflow from the North Sea that contains high saline and oxygen content.

==Ecology==
In the Baltic Sea, cod, herring, and sprat are considered the most important species. Cod is the top predator, while the herring and sprat primarily are recognized as prey. This has been proven by many studies that analyze the stomach contents of such fish, often finding contents that immediately signify predation among the species. Although cod primarily feed on adult sprat, sprat tend to feed on cod before the cod have been fully developed. The sprat tends to prey on the cod eggs and larvae. Furthermore, sprat and herring are considered highly competitive for the same resources that are available to them. This is most present in the vertical migration of the two species in the Baltic Sea, where they compete for the limited zooplankton that is available and necessary for their survival.

Sprats are highly selective in their diet and are strict zooplanktivores that do not change their diet as their size increases, like some herring, but include only zooplankton in their diet. They eat various species of zooplankton in accordance to changes in the environment, as temperature and other such factors affect the availability of their food.

During autumn, sprats tend to have a diet high in &quot;Temora longicornis&quot; and &quot;Bosmina maritime&quot;. During the winter, their diet includes &quot;Pesudocalanus elongates&quot;. &quot;Pseudocalanus&quot; is genus of the order Calanoida and subclass Copepoda that is important to the predation and diet of fish in the Baltic Sea.

In both autumn and winter, a tendency exists for sprats to avoid eating &quot;Acartia&quot; spp., because they tend to be very small in size and have a high escape response to predators such as the herring and sprat. Although &quot;Acartia&quot; spp. may be present in large numbers, they also tend to dwell more toward the surface of the water, whereas the sprats, especially during the day, tend to dwell in deeper waters.

==Fisheries==

==As food==

In Northern Europe, European sprats are commonly smoked and preserved in oil, which retains a strong, smoky flavor.

Sprat, if smoked, is considered to be one of the foods highest in purine content.

Sprats contain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They are present in amounts comparable to Atlantic salmon, and up to seven times higher in EPA and DHA than common fresh fillets of gilt-head bream. The sprats contain about 1.43 g/100 g of these polyunsaturated fatty acids that have been found to help prevent mental, neural, and cardiovascular diseases.

<doc id="1154951" wikidata="Q1343584" url="?curid=1154951" title="Earth–Moon–Earth communication">
<text>Earth–Moon–Earth communication (EME), also known as Moon bounce, is a radio communications technique that relies on the propagation of radio waves from an Earth-based transmitter directed via reflection from the surface of the Moon back to an Earth-based receiver.

== History ==

The use of the Moon as a passive communications satellite was proposed by W.J. Bray of the British General Post Office in 1940. It was calculated that with the available microwave transmission powers and low-noise receivers, it would be possible to beam microwave signals up from Earth and reflect them off the Moon. It was thought that at least one voice channel would be possible.

Radar reflections off the moon were received and recognized as such in 1943 during German experiments with radio measurement equipment, as reported by Dr. Ing. W. Stepp in &quot;Der Seewart&quot; magazine. Stepp noted a &quot;perturbation&quot;, which &quot;appeared, had a duration of several impulses, and larger impulse strength than the strongest nearby targets. It didn&#x27;t appear until about two seconds after switching on the transmitter and disappeared (pulsatingly) correspondingly later after switching it off. But the rest of the echo image appeared and disappeared at the instance of switching the transmitter on/off. The &#x27;perturbation&#x27; only occurred when the antenna was aimed to the east, and it disappeared immediately upon a major change of direction, but reappeared only about two seconds after rotating back to the original direction. Apparently we had detected the rising moon behind the clouds with the equipment. It explained the gradual disappearance of the impulses by the reflecting body slowly moving out of the strongly focussed, horizontally aimed beam, as it rises above the horizon.&quot;

It was not until the close of World War II, however, that techniques specifically intended for the purpose of bouncing radar waves off the moon to demonstrate their potential use in defense, communication, and radar astronomy were developed. The first successful attempt was carried out at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, on January 10, 1946, by a group code-named Project Diana, headed by John H. DeWitt. It was followed less than a month later, on February 6, 1946, by a second successful attempt, by a Hungarian group led by Zoltán Bay. The Communication Moon Relay project that followed led to more practical uses, including a teletype link between the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and United States Navy headquarters in Washington, D.C. In the days before communications satellites, a link free of the of ionospheric propagation was revolutionary.

The development of communication satellites in the 1960s made this technique obsolete. However, radio amateurs took up EME communication as a hobby; the first amateur radio moonbounce communication took place in 1953, and amateurs worldwide still use the technique. Composer Pauline Oliveros used moonbounce in her 1987 work &quot;Echoes from the Moon,&quot; and in 2024 German musician Hainbach experimented with moonbounce and created an audio plug-in to reproduce the effect.

== Current EME communications ==
Amateur radio (ham) operators utilize EME for two-way communications. EME presents significant challenges to amateur operators interested in weak signal communication. EME provides the longest communications path any two stations on Earth can use.

Amateur frequency bands from 50 MHz to 47 GHz have been used successfully, but most EME communications are on the 2 meter, 70-centimeter, or 23-centimeter bands. Common modulation modes are continuous wave with Morse code, digital (JT65) and when the link budgets allow, voice.

Recent advances in digital signal processing have allowed EME contacts, admittedly with low data rate, to take place with powers in the order of 100 watts and a single Yagi–Uda antenna.

World Moon Bounce Day, June 29, 2009, was created by Echoes of Apollo and celebrated worldwide as an event preceding the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. A highlight of the celebrations was an interview via the Moon with Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, who was also part of the backup crew for Apollo 11. The University of Tasmania in Australia with their 26-meter (85&#x27;) dish were able to bounce a data signal off the surface of the Moon which was received by a large dish in the Netherlands, Dwingeloo Radio Observatory. The data signal was successfully resolved back to data setting a world record for the lowest power data signal returned from the Moon with a transmit power of 3 milliwatts, about 1,000th of the power of a flashlight lamp. The second World Moon Bounce Day was April 17, 2010, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Apollo 13 mission.

In October 2009 media artist Daniela de Paulis proposed to the CAMRAS radio amateur association based at the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory to use Moon bounce for a live image transmission performance. As a result of her proposal, in December 2009 CAMRAS radio operator Jan van Muijlwijk and radio operator Daniel Gautchi made the first image transmission via the Moon using the open source software MMSSTV. De Paulis called the innovative technology &quot;Visual Moonbounce&quot; and since 2010 she has been using it in several of her art projects, including the live performance called OPTICKS, during which digital images are sent to the Moon and back in real time and projected live.

== Echo delay and time spread ==

Radio waves propagate in vacuum at the speed of light &quot;c&quot;, exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Propagation time to the Moon and back ranges from 2.4 to 2.7 seconds, with an average of 2.56 seconds (the average distance from Earth to the Moon is 384,400 km).

The Moon is nearly spherical, and its radius corresponds to about 5.8 milliseconds of wave travel time. The trailing parts of an echo, reflected from irregular surface features near the edge of the lunar disk, are delayed from the leading edge by as much as twice this value.

Most of the Moon&#x27;s surface appears relatively smooth at the typical microwave wavelengths used for amateur EME. Most amateurs do EME contacts below 6 GHz, and differences in the moon&#x27;s reflectivity are somewhat hard to discern above 1 GHz.
Lunar reflections are by nature quasi-specular (like those from a shiny ball bearing). The power useful for communication is mostly reflected from a small region near the center of the disk. The effective time spread of an echo amounts to no more than 0.1 ms.

Antenna polarization for EME stations must consider that reflection from a smooth surface preserves linear polarization but reverses the sense of circular polarizations.

At shorter wavelengths the lunar surface appears increasingly rough, so reflections at 10 GHz and above contain a significant diffuse component as well as a quasi-specular component. The diffuse component is depolarized, and can be viewed as a source of low level system noise. Significant portions of the diffused component arise from regions farther out toward the lunar rim. The median time spread can then be as much as several milliseconds. In all practical cases, however, time spreading is small enough that it does not cause significant smearing of CW keying or intersymbol interference in the slowly keyed modulations commonly used for digital EME. The diffused component may appear as significant noise at higher message data rates.

EME time spreading does have one very significant effect. Signal components reflected from different parts of the lunar surface travel different distances and arrive at Earth with random phase relationships. As the relative geometry of the transmitting station, receiving station and reflecting lunar surface changes, signal components sometimes add and sometimes cancel, depending on their phase relationship, creating large amplitude fluctuations in the received signal. These &quot;libration fading&quot; amplitude variations are well correlated over the coherence bandwidth (typically a few kHz). The libration fading components are related to the time spread of reflected signals.

* JT65A, JT65B, Q65

== Other factors influencing EME communications ==

Doppler effect at 144 MHz band is 300 Hz at moonrise or moonset. The doppler offset reduces to around zero when the Moon is overhead. At other frequencies other doppler offsets will exist. At moonrise, returned signals will be shifted approximately 300 Hz higher in frequency. As the Moon traverses the sky to a point due south or due north, the Doppler effect approaches zero. By Moonset, they are shifted 300 Hz lower. Doppler effects cause many problems when tuning into, and locking onto, signals from the Moon.

Polarization effects can reduce the strength of received signals. One component is the geometrical alignment of the transmitting and receiving antennas. Many antennas produce a preferred plane of polarization. Transmitting and receiving station antennas may not be aligned from the perspective of an observer on the moon. This component is fixed by the alignment of the antennas and stations may include a facility to rotate antennas to adjust polarization. Another component is Faraday rotation on the Earth-Moon-Earth path. The plane of polarization of radio waves rotates as they pass through ionized layers of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower VHF frequencies and becomes less significant at 1296 MHz and above. Some of the polarization mismatch loss can be reduced by using a larger antenna array (more Yagi elements or a larger dish).

<text>West End theatre is mainstream professional theatre staged in the large theatres in and near the West End of London. Along with New York City&#x27;s Broadway theatre, West End theatre represents the highest level of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world. Seeing a West End show is a common tourist activity in London. Prominent screen actors, British and international alike, frequently appear on the London stage.

There are approximately 40 theatres in the West End, with the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, opened in May 1663, the oldest theatre in London. The Savoy Theatre—built as a showcase for the popular series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan—was entirely lit by electricity in 1881.

The Society of London Theatre (SOLT) announced that 2018 was a record year for the capital&#x27;s theatre industry with attendances topping 15.5 million for the first time since the organisation began collecting audience data in 1986. Box office revenues exceeded £765 million. While attendance in 2019 was down 1.4% compared to the previous year, box office revenues reached a record £799 million. In 2023, audiences reached a record 17.1 million.

The majority of West End theatres are owned by the ATG Entertainment, Delfont Mackintosh Theatres, Nimax Theatres, LW Theatres, and the Nederlander Organization.

==History==

Theatre in London flourished after the English Reformation. The first permanent public playhouse, known as The Theatre, was constructed in 1576 in Shoreditch by James Burbage. It was soon joined by The Curtain. Both are known to have been used by William Shakespeare&#x27;s company. In 1599, the timber from The Theatre was moved to Southwark, where it was used in building the Globe Theatre in a new theatre district formed beyond the controls of the City corporation. Regarding theatre as sinful, these theatres were closed in 1642 due to the Puritans who would later influence the interregnum of 1649. On 24 January 1643, the actors protested against the ban by writing a pamphlet titled &quot;The Actors remonstrance or complaint for the silencing of their profession, and banishment from their severall play-houses&quot;.

After the Restoration (1660), Puritan legislation was declared null and void, and theatre (among other arts) exploded. Two companies were licensed to perform, the Duke&#x27;s Company and the King&#x27;s Company. Performances were held in converted buildings, such as Lisle&#x27;s Tennis Court. The first West End theatre, known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street, was designed by Thomas Killigrew and built on the site of the present Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It opened on 7 May 1663 and was destroyed by a fire nine years later. It was replaced by a new structure designed by Christopher Wren and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. One of the first actresses on the stage, Nell Gwyn became a star of restoration comedy.

Outside the West End, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre opened in Islington on 3 June 1683. Taking its name from founder Richard Sadler and monastic springs that were discovered on the property, it operated as a &quot;Musick House&quot;, with performances of opera; as it was not licensed for plays. In the West End, the Theatre Royal Haymarket opened on 29 December 1720 on a site slightly north of its current location, and the Royal Opera House opened in Covent Garden on 7 December 1732. John Gay&#x27;s ballad opera &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; ran for 62 performances in 1728, and held the record for London&#x27;s longest run for nearly a century. It has been called &quot;the most popular play of the eighteenth century.&quot; Another musical show, &quot;Tom and Jerry, or Life in London&quot; (1821), was the first London production to reach 100 consecutive performances. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;&#x27;s combination of a tour of London interspersed with song and dance, gave rise to numerous similar, loosely constructed entertainments, and &quot;planted the seeds for later musical comedy and revue&quot;.

The Patent theatre companies retained their duopoly on drama well into the 19th century, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments. By the early 19th century, however, music hall entertainments became popular, and presenters found a loophole in the restrictions on non-patent theatres in the genre of melodrama. Melodrama did not break the Patent Acts, as it was accompanied by music. Initially, these entertainments were presented in large halls, attached to public houses, but purpose-built theatres began to appear in the East End, such as the Pavilion Theatre in Whitechapel. The comic theatrical genre the harlequinade was also popular among London audiences. Its most famous performer, Joseph Grimaldi, best known for developing the modern day white-face clown, made his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780.
The West End theatre district became established with the opening of many small theatres and halls, including the Adelphi in The Strand on 17 November 1806. South of the River Thames, the Old Vic, Waterloo Road, opened on 11 May 1818. The expansion of the West End theatre district gained pace with the Theatres Act 1843, which relaxed the conditions for the performance of plays, and The Strand gained another venue when the Vaudeville opened on 16 April 1870. The next few decades saw the opening of many new theatres in the West End. The Adelphi hosted &quot;A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future&quot; in 1844, a play adapted from the novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens—who came to several stage rehearsals during which he made suggestions—with his book published weeks earlier in December 1843.

The Criterion Theatre opened on Piccadilly Circus on 21 March 1874, and in 1881, two more houses appeared: the Savoy Theatre in The Strand, built by Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte specifically to showcase the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, opened in October (the first theatre and public building to be lit by electric lights, with &quot;The Times&quot; recording, &quot;the success of the new mode of illumination was complete, and its importance for the development of scenic art can scarcely be overrated&quot;), and five days later the Comedy Theatre opened as the Royal Comedy Theatre on Panton Street in Leicester Square. It abbreviated its name three years later. On 23 December 1886, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (the first major production of the &quot;Alice&quot; books) debuted at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Its author Lewis Carroll was involved in the stage adaptation, and he attended a performance seven days later. The Palace Theatre opened in 1891. Opened in 1892, the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre debuted J. M. Barrie&#x27;s play, &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, on 27 December 1904.

One of the most popular playwrights in London in the 1890s, Oscar Wilde, premiered his second comedy, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;, at Haymarket Theatre in 1893. The subject of widespread public and media interest, Lillie Langtry (an associate of Wilde) made her West End debut in the comedy &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; in 1881. In 1878, Ellen Terry joined Henry Irving&#x27;s company as his leading lady, and for more than the next two decades she was considered the leading Shakespearean and comic actress in Britain. Opened in 1903, the New Theatre debuted &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in 1905, a play that introduced a heroic figure with an alter ego into the public consciousness. The theatre was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in 2006 after the playwright Noël Coward. Constructed in 1897, Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre hosted a number of premieres, including George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; in 1914. The theatre building boom continued until about the First World War.

In 1930, Laurence Olivier had his first important West End success in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;. A number of other actors made their West End debut prior to the Second World War, including John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison; the latter&#x27;s performance in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s 1936 comedy &quot;French Without Tears&quot; at the Criterion Theatre established him a leading light comedian. During the 1950s and 1960s, many plays were produced in theatre clubs, to evade the censorship then exercised by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. The Theatres Act 1968 finally abolished censorship of the stage in the United Kingdom.

==Theatreland==

&quot;Theatreland&quot;, London&#x27;s main theatre district, contains approximately 40 venues and is located in and near the heart of the West End of London. It is traditionally defined by the Strand to the south, Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, and Kingsway to the east. However, a few other nearby theatres are also considered &quot;West End&quot; despite being outside the area proper; an example is The Apollo Victoria Theatre, in Westminster. Prominent theatre streets include Drury Lane, Shaftesbury Avenue and the Strand. The works staged are predominantly musicals, classic and modern straight plays, and comedy performances.

Many theatres in the West End are of late Victorian or Edwardian construction and are privately owned. Many are architecturally impressive, and the largest and best maintained feature grand neo-classical, Romanesque, or Victorian façades and luxurious, detailed interior design and decoration. Theatre names, such as Empire, Lyceum, Palladium, Alhambra and Hippodrome, emphasised a grandeur of scale.
However, owing to the age of the buildings, leg room is often cramped, and audience facilities such as bars and toilets are often much smaller than in modern theatres. The protected status of the buildings and their confined urban locations, combined with financial constraints, make it very difficult to make substantial improvements to the level of comfort offered. In 2003, the Theatres Trust estimated that an investment of £250 million over the following 15 years was required for modernisation, and stated that 60% of theatres had seats from which the stage was not fully visible. 
Starting in 2004, there were several incidents of falling plasterwork, or performances being cancelled because of urgent building repairs being required. These events culminated in the partial collapse of the ceiling of the Apollo Theatre in December 2013. Of these earlier incidents, only one led to people being hurt, but at the Apollo 76 people needed medical treatment for their injuries. A number of West End theatres have undergone refurbishments, including the Victoria Palace Theatre following the run of &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; in 2016. The Dominion Theatre refurbishment was completed in 2017 with the unveiling of a new double-sided LED screen, the largest and highest resolution projecting screen on the exterior of a West End theatre.

In 2012, gross sales of £529,787,692 were up 0.27% and attendances also increased 0.56% to 13,992,773-year-on-year. In 2013, sales again rose this time by 11% to £585,506,455, with attendances rising to 14,587,276. This was despite slightly fewer performances occurring in 2013.

On 16 March 2020, following government advice due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all theatres in the West End were closed until further notice. Theatres in London were allowed to re-open (with social distancing) on 17 May 2021, with full capacity permitted from 19 July. Opening in October 2022, @sohoplace is the first new West End theatre in 50 years.

==Long-running shows==
The length of West End shows depends on ticket sales. The longest-running musical in West End history is &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, produced by Cameron Mackintosh, which has been running in London since October 1985. It overtook Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot;, which closed in 2002 after running for 8,949 performances and 21 years, as the longest-running West End musical of all time on 9 October 2006. Other long-runners include Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera,&quot; Willy Russell&#x27;s &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, and Abba jukebox musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; which have also subsequently overtaken &quot;Cats&quot;. However, the non-musical Agatha Christie play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; is the longest-running production in the world, and has been performed continuously since 1952.

Running since 2011, &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;, an adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Matilda,&quot; won a then-record seven Olivier Awards in 2012. Running since 2016, &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, a two-part play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by J. K. Rowling, won a record-breaking nine Olivier Awards in 2017.

===Upcoming productions===

The following shows are confirmed as future West End productions. The theatre in which they will run is either not yet known or currently occupied by another show.

==London&#x27;s non-commercial theatres==
The term &quot;West End theatre&quot; is generally used to refer specifically to commercial productions in Theatreland. However, the leading non-commercial theatres in London enjoy great artistic prestige. These include the National Theatre, the Barbican Centre, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe (including the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse), the Old Vic, Royal Court Theatre, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, and the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre. These theatres stage a high proportion of straight drama, Shakespeare, other classic plays and premieres of new plays by leading playwrights—for example David Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Pravda&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins which was described by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as &quot;one of the biggest hits in the history of the National Theatre.&quot; Successful productions from the non-commercial theatres sometimes transfer to one of the commercial West End houses for an extended run.

The Royal Opera House is widely regarded as one of the greatest opera houses in the world, comparable with the Palais Garnier and La Scala. Commonly known simply as Covent Garden due to its location, it is home to the Royal Opera, Royal Ballet and a resident symphony orchestra, and hosts guest performances from other leading opera, ballet and performance companies from around the world. In 1735 its first season of operas, by George Frideric Handel, began and many of his English oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres here.

Likewise, the London Coliseum is the resident home to the English National Opera. The theatre is also the London base for performances by the English National Ballet, who perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour. The Peacock Theatre is located on the edge of the Theatreland area. Now owned by the London School of Economics and Political Science, it is used in the evenings for dance performances by Sadler&#x27;s Wells, who manage the theatre on behalf of the school.

==Other London theatres==

There are a great number of stage productions in London outside the West End. Much of this is known as fringe theatre (referred to as Off West End) which is the equivalent of off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway theatre in New York City. Among these are the Menier Chocolate Factory, Bush Theatre and the Donmar Warehouse. Fringe venues range from well-equipped small theatres to rooms above pubs, and the performances range from classic plays, to cabaret, to plays in the languages of London&#x27;s ethnic minorities. The performers range from emerging young professionals to amateurs. Productions at the Donmar included the 1980 play &quot;Educating Rita&quot; which starred Julie Walters in the title role before she reprised the role in the 1983 film.

There are many theatres located throughout Greater London, such as the Lyric Hammersmith, Theatre Royal Stratford East, Rose Theatre, Kingston, New Wimbledon Theatre, the Rudolph Steiner Theatre in Westminster, the Ashcroft Theatre in Croydon, Secombe Theatre in Sutton, the Churchill Theatre in Bromley and the Hackney Empire in Hackney.

The theatre at the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster) in Regent Street saw the first public demonstration of &quot;Pepper&#x27;s ghost&quot;—a method of projecting the illusion of a ghost into a theatre (named after its developer John Henry Pepper)—during an 1862 Christmas Eve theatrical production of the Charles Dickens novel, &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot;, which caused a sensation among those in attendance.

London theatres outside the West End also played an important role in the early history of drama schools. In 1833, actress Frances Maria Kelly managed the Royal Strand Theatre in Westminster where she funded and operated a dramatic school, the earliest record of a drama school in England. In 1840, she financed the Royalty Theatre in Soho which opened as Miss Kelly&#x27;s Theatre and Dramatic School.

==Awards==
There are a number of annual awards for outstanding achievements in London theatre:
* Laurence Olivier Awards
* &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards
* WhatsOnStage Awards
* Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Awards
* Ian Charleson Awards
* National Dance Awards
* West End Frame Awards

<doc id="1154954" wikidata="Q1424307" url="?curid=1154954" title="Lady in the Dark">
<text>Lady in the Dark is a musical with music by Kurt Weill, lyrics by Ira Gershwin and book and direction by Moss Hart. It was produced by Sam Harris. The protagonist, Liza Elliott, is the unhappy editor of a fashion magazine who is undergoing psychoanalysis. The musical ran on Broadway in 1941, and in the United Kingdom in 1981. A film version was released in 1944, and a live television special followed in 1954.

==Structure==
&quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; has an unusual structure for a work of musical theatre. The play is divided into dialogue scenes portraying the life of the protagonist, Liza Elliott, and dream sequences portraying her fantasies and nightmares. The musical score is confined to the dream sequences, each of which takes the form of a mini-operetta; unlike a typical book musical, no songs are performed during the real-life scenes.

==Story==
Liza Elliott finds herself constantly plagued by indecision in her professional and personal life. She is courted by two men, the already-married publisher Kendall Nesbitt who is trying to divorce his wife for Liza, and the film star Randy Curtis, and cannot decide whom to choose. When she begins seeing a psychologist, she delves into her dreams and memories of her unhappy childhood, and is haunted by the melody of a song she cannot recall. In one dream, she believes she is being put on trial for her indecision in a circus setting, with her marketing manager Charley Johnson acting as prosecutor, Kendall as chief witness, and Randy as her defense attorney, in which she defends her refusal to make up her mind (&quot;The Saga of Jenny&quot;). She eventually comes to realize that the root of her trauma is having been repeatedly rejected in her youth due to her plain appearance; as she makes this breakthrough, she remembers the mysterious song (&quot;My Ship&quot;). She realizes that Kendall and Randy both relate to her only on a superficial level, and finds true partnership with Charley, who sees her as an equal.

==Background==
Originally beginning as a solo effort, &quot;I Am Listening&quot; by Moss Hart about a successful woman who is under the care of a psychiatrist. Late developed into a work involving Kurt Weill with a change in title. 

The musical&#x27;s theme of psychoanalysis is said to be based on Hart&#x27;s own experiences with psychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg. Except for the final song, all the music in the play is heard in three extended dream sequences: the Glamour Dream, the Wedding Dream, and the Circus Dream, which, to some extent, become three small operettas integrated into a straight play. The final song, &quot;My Ship&quot;, functions as a leitmotif for Liza&#x27;s insecurity: as each dream commences, a snippet of the tune is heard, as it is a haunting melody which Liza recognizes but cannot name, or sing with words, until her anxiety is resolved.

==Productions==
The musical opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon) on January 23, 1941 and closed on May 30, 1942 after 467 performances. Direction was by Hart, produced by Sam H. Harris, with musical staging by Hassard Short, who also was the production designer, and choreography by Albertina Rasch. The original cast included Gertrude Lawrence in the role of Liza Elliott, alongside Danny Kaye, Bert Lytell, Victor Mature, Donald Randolph, Margaret Dale, Davis Cunningham and Macdonald Carey.

Kaye&#x27;s performance as fashion photographer Russell Paxton, and particularly his consistently showstopping performance of the patter song &quot;Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)&quot; in which he dashes through the names of 50 Russian composers in 39 seconds, made him a star. The musical went on an eight city tour for 160 performances, and also played on the West Coast, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, for 56 performances. The show then ran at The Broadway Theatre from February 27 through May 15, 1943, for 83 performances. Gertrude Lawrence reprised her role as Liza Elliott in all venues.

==Subsequent productions==
&quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; premiered in the United Kingdom on December 9, 1981, at the Nottingham Playhouse, Nottingham. American actor Celeste Holm starred; it was her British debut. Kendall Nesbitt was Jeremy Hawk, Robert Swales played Randy Curtis and Kenneth Nelson appeared as Russell Paxton. The show was produced by Crispin Thomas and musical director was Tony Britten. Jane Wenham was assistant director. 

A New York City Center Encores! semi-staged concert was produced in New York in May 1994 with Christine Ebersole.

The musical opened on the West End at the Royal National Theatre, London, on March 11, running through August 2, 1997, directed by Francesca Zambello and starring Maria Friedman. The production received the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Musical.

A production was staged by Boston Academy of Music in 2000 starring mezzo-soprano Delores Ziegler, and by Philadelphia&#x27;s Prince Music Theatre in the autumn of 2001, with Andrea Marcovicci as Liza Elliott.

A production by MasterVoices, directed and conducted by Ted Sperling, choreographed by Doug Varone, and starring Victoria Clark as Liza Elliott took place at New York City Center on April 25, 26, and 27, 2019. This production featured MasterVoices&#x27; 120 singers, the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s, and Doug Varone and Dancers. Amy Irving played Dr. Brooks and Victoria Clark played Liza Elliot.

A production was staged in China at Beijing’s Century Theatre in April 2003, directed by Jennifer Schwerin, conducted by Nicholas Michael Smith and produced by Nancy Fraser, Andrew Andreasen and Jiang Shan. Marsha Mercant performed the role of Liza Elliot and Michael Sterling performed the role of the Ringmaster.

==Adaptations==
The 1944 film version starred Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. The film cut most of the Weill/Gershwin songs, though &quot;The Saga of Jenny&quot; and &quot;Girl of the Moment&quot; remained, and part of &quot;This Is New&quot; is played by a nightclub band in the background. &quot;My Ship&quot; was heard as background music, but never sung, even though the music was constantly referred to in the story. Kaye&#x27;s role went to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Mad Russian,&quot; the slightly taller Mischa Auer.

&quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; was adapted for the radio on multiple occasions. Gertrude Lawrence twice reprised her leading stage role for a one-hour adaptation on &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot;; on October 19, 1947, and on March 5, 1950. On January 29, 1945, Ginger Rogers, who played Liza in the film version, starred with Ray Milland in a one-hour adaptation for &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on CBS Radio. On February 16, 1953 Judy Garland starred in a second &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; adaptation alongside John Lund.

The musical was broadcast on NBC Television on September 25, 1954, as part of an irregularly scheduled series under the umbrella title &quot;Max Liebman Presents&quot;. Ann Sothern played Liza, and Carleton Carpenter played Russell. A cast recording of the TV special was released on Sepia.

==Recordings==
Although recordings of individual songs were made, no attempt was made to record the entire score until 1963, when Lehman Engel produced a stereo studio recording for Columbia, starring Risë Stevens, Roger White, and Adolph Green. This recording was reissued as a Masterworks Heritage CD, MHK 62869. The reissue also includes five 1941 mono recordings of songs (including &quot;Tschaikowsky&quot;) sung by Danny Kaye. According to the liner notes, the maximum playing time of an LP did not permit including everything, and some cuts were made (not specified, but mostly in the number of verses or repeats).

The Royal National Theatre revival in 1997 led to the first complete recording of the score (TER/JAY).

A telecast from February 11, 1981 &quot;Musical Comedy Tonight II&quot; presented Danny Kaye (from the original cast), Lynn Redgrave, and others reenacting the circus scene from the original production of &quot;Lady in the Dark,&quot; including Kaye&#x27;s hit song &quot;Tchaikovsky&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Life Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;with its unique blend of serious drama, musical comedy and pageantry, &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; is a grand-scale smash hit.&quot;

<doc id="1154964" wikidata="Q1605686" url="?curid=1154964" title="Henri-Pierre Roché">
<text>Henri-Pierre Roché (28 May 1879 – 9 April 1959) was a French author who was involved with the artistic avant-garde in Paris and the Dada movement.

Late in life, Roché published two novels. The first was &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; (1953), a semi-autobiographical work published when he was 74. His second novel, &quot;Deux Anglaises et le continent&quot; (Two English Girls, 1956), also was inspired by his life. Both were adapted as films by the director François Truffaut, in 1962 and 1971 respectively. The popularity of the film &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; brought renewed attention to Roché&#x27;s novels and life.

== Biography ==
Roché was born in Paris, France. In 1898, he was an art student at the Académie Julian.

Roché became a journalist as well as an art collector and dealer. At the turn of the 20th century, he became close friends with young European artists in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, including Manuel Ortiz de Zárate and Marie Vassilieff; and from Montmartre, Max Jacob and Pablo Picasso. He was at home in the world of artists, collectors and gallerists. In November 1905, he introduced the Americans Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo to Picasso.

Leo Stein described Roché as &quot;a tall man with an inquiring eye under an inquisitive forehead, wanted to know something more about everything. He was a born liaison officer, who knew everybody and wanted everybody to know everybody else.&quot; Gertrude, in chapter 3 of her &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, described Roché in much the same terms. She particularly appreciated his having read her &quot;Three Lives&quot; and early recognition of her value as a writer.

Roché was also a friend of Francis Picabia, Constantin Brâncuși and Marcel Duchamp. Following his discharge from the French army, Roché and Duchamp traveled to New York City in 1916. There, they worked with Beatrice Wood to create &quot;The Blind Man&quot; and &quot;Rongwrong&quot;, two magazines that were among the early manifestations in the United States of the Dada art movement.

Roché became the chief advisor to the American art collector John Quinn in 1917 and made many acquisitions for him from 1917 to 1924.

Known for his womanizing, Roché married twice, first to Germaine Bonnard (1927–1948; separated 1933), then to Denise Renard (1948–1959). He had no children with Bonnard. His only child, a son with Renard, Jean-Claude Roche, was born in 1931.

==Later years and writing==
In his later years, he wrote and published two successful novels. His first novel, &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; (1952), was published when he was 74. His second novel, also inspired by his life, was &quot;Deux Anglaises et le continent&quot; (Two English Girls, 1956). Both novels, although written by a man who was quite advanced in age, express a vitality and freshness not often seen in French romantic stories of the time.

The French film director François Truffaut came across a copy of &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; secondhand. He located Roché and befriended the writer in his final years. Roché died in 1959 in Sèvres, Hauts-de-Seine. Truffaut was so impressed by Roché&#x27;s two novels that he adapted each of them as films. Truffaut&#x27;s first adaptation, &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; (1962), was followed by the earliest English translation of the novel as a Panther paperback published in Great Britain in 1963. Truffaut&#x27;s version of &quot;Deux Anglaises et le continent&quot; was released with the trivially different title &quot;Les Deux Anglaises et le continent&quot; in 1971 (&quot;Two English Girls&quot; or &quot;Anne and Muriel&quot; in anglophone markets). The opening credits of the second film roll over images of the novel&#x27;s cover (Gallimard edition) and internal pages with Truffaut&#x27;s annotations, in homage to Roché and emphasising the film&#x27;s debt to its source.

&quot;Jules et Jim&quot; was inspired by the love triangle involving Roché, the German writer Franz Hessel (who translated Marcel Proust into German, as the character Jules did) and Helen Grund, who married Hessel. It is not based on the triangle involving Roché, Beatrice Wood and Marcel Duchamp, as sometimes suggested in Wood&#x27;s later years. Roché did, however, allude to the Roché-Wood-Duchamp triangle in his unfinished novel, &quot;Victor&quot;. Beatrice Wood herself saw little resemblance between &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; and her relationship with Roché and Duchamp, writing in her 1985 autobiography, &quot;IShock Myself&quot;:

<text>Thomas Clarke Rye (June 2, 1863September 12, 1953) was an American politician who served as the 32nd governor of Tennessee from 1915 to 1919. An ardent supporter of prohibition of alcoholic beverages, he helped reunify the state&#x27;s Democratic Party, which had been divided over the 
issue for nearly a decade. Rye is perhaps best remembered for enacting the &quot;Ouster Law,&quot; which was aimed at curbing the power of political boss E. H. Crump.

==Early life==
Rye was born in Benton County, Tennessee, the son of Wayne Rye, a merchant, and Elizabeth (Atchison) Rye. He was educated at local schools, and read law under his uncle, Colonel Tom Morris, in nearby Charlotte, Tennessee. In 1884, after his admission to the bar, he moved to Camden, Tennessee, to practice law. During the 1890s, he served as circuit master of Camden&#x27;s chancery court, and worked for several years as a pension agent in Washington, D. C. In 1902, Rye moved to Paris, Tennessee, where he established a law partnership with W.W. Farquard.

Rye served as District Attorney for the Thirteenth Judicial District from 1910 to 1914. He quickly gained a reputation as the state&#x27;s most &quot;stringent&quot; law enforcement agent, and was described as a &quot;terror to the bootleggers and dispensers of whisky.&quot;

==Governor==

In the early 1910s, the state Democratic Party was divided over the issue of prohibition. One faction, known as the &quot;Independent Democrats,&quot; wanted the state&#x27;s Four Mile Law (which banned the sale of liquor within four miles of any school) to apply statewide, while the other faction, known as the &quot;Regular Democrats,&quot; wanted the state&#x27;s larger cities to be exempt from the law. In 1910, the Independent Democrats fled the party and formed a coalition, known as the &quot;Fusionists,&quot; with Republicans, helping to elect Governor Ben W. Hooper.

At its May convention in 1914, the Democratic Party added statewide prohibition to the party&#x27;s platform, all but ending the rift between Regular and Independent Democratics. Rye, well known among supporters of prohibition, received the endorsements of Senator Luke Lea and former Governor Malcolm R. Patterson, and was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate. With the party once again unified, Rye defeated Hooper 137,656 votes to 116,667. Hooper accused Memphis political boss E.H. Crump of fixing the vote in Shelby County, but no investigation was launched.

During his first term, Rye enacted the so-called &quot;Ouster Law,&quot; which allowed for the removal of public officials for incompetence or unwillingness to enforce the law. This law was aimed primarily at Crump, who as Mayor of Memphis had refused to enforce prohibition in the city. The state attorney general filed a suit removing Crump in October 1915. When the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the action, the Rye administration proceeded to purge any official who refused to enforce prohibition, among them District Attorney Newton Estes and Judge Jesse Edgington of Memphis, as well as several officials in Nashville (including Mayor Hilary Howse) and Knoxville.

Rye&#x27;s administration created the State Highway Department (the modern Tennessee Department of Transportation) in 1915. He signed legislation requiring automobile registration, and implemented a state highway tax to match federal funding. In April 1915, Rye attended a meeting of the Dixie Highway Association, where he helped set the route of the Dixie Highway, an early tourist road connecting the Midwestern states with Florida.

In March 1915, Rye signed legislation chartering Tennessee Polytechnic Institute (modern Tennessee Technological University) in Cookeville. During his tenure, he expanded the state&#x27;s Board of Education, and implemented a tax to support schools.

In the governor&#x27;s race of 1916, Republicans nominated John W. Overall, a U.S. marshal from Liberty, Tennessee. Rye defeated Overall by a vote of 146,758 to 117,817.

During Rye&#x27;s second term, the United States entered World War I. Over 80,000 Tennesseans entered the United States Armed Forces, and more of them were deployed overseas than ever before in Tennessee history. The number of Tennesseans was the most ever serving actively in the military up to that time except for the number serving in Confederate forces during the Civil War.

In 1917, Rye enacted legislation that implemented a primary for selecting candidates for state offices from the Democratic and Republican parties (candidates were previously selected by delegates at party conventions). The debate over primaries had divided the Democratic Party since the 1910 elections.

==Later life==

At the end of his second term, Rye did not seek reelection. He instead ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by John K. Shields. Shields, who had been elected to the seat by the state legislature prior to the passage of the 17th Amendment (which established direct election of senators), had angered President Woodrow Wilson by opposing the League of Nations, and Wilson threatened to endorse Rye. Senator Kenneth McKellar convinced the president to withhold his endorsement in return for Shields&#x27; support for the League, however, and Shields defeated Rye for the nomination.

After losing the Senate nomination, Rye returned to Paris to practice law. In 1922, he was appointed chancellor (judge) of the state&#x27;s Eighth Judicial District. He remained in this position for nearly two decades.

Rye died in Paris on September 12, 1953, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Maplewood Cemetery. At the time of his death, he became the second longest-lived governor in Tennessee history at the age of 90 years and 3 months. Governor John I. Cox was the longest at 90 years, 9 months. In April 2018, Winfield Dunn (b. July 1927) broke Cox&#x27;s longevity record and as of July 2019, has surpassed his 92nd birthday, and now Rye is the third longest-lived governor in state history.

==Family==

Rye was descended from Irish immigrants. He married Bettie Arnold in 1887. They had a daughter, Nell, and a son, Paul.

<text>André Hébuterne (3 September 1894 – 30 June 1992 in Paris) was a French painter.

==Early life==
Born in Meaux, in the Seine-et-Marne département of France, Hébuterne moved with his family to Paris, where as a young man he began to pursue a career in art. He introduced his younger sister, Jeanne (1898–1920) to the artistic community in the Montparnasse Quarter, where she eventually became the partner of Modigliani. Following his sister&#x27;s suicide, and the death of their parents, Hébuterne was given legal possession of Jeanne&#x27;s personal papers and artwork. Her drawings and paintings were kept private until his widow allowed public access to them.

==Career==
Hébuterne had limited success as an artist but made etchings that appeared in a 1948 reprint of a Gargantua book based on the François Rabelais creation.

<text>Manuel Ortiz de Zárate Pinto (October 9, 1887 – October 28, 1946) was a Chilean painter, born in Italy and raised in Chile. He was active from 1902 to 1945, in Paris and in Italy.

== Biography ==
Born as Manuel Revuelta Ortiz de Zárate Pinto in Como, Italy. He came from an old Castilian family from Province of Ávila, the son of composer, Eleodoro Ortiz de Zárate and of Matilde Pinto Benavente. He was the younger brother of painter, Julio Ortiz de Zárate. He was four years old when the family moved back to Chile. He went on to study painting with Pedro Lira, before entering the Escuela de Bellas Artes (Academy of Fine Arts) in Santiago.

At age 15, he fled home and stowed away on a ship to Italy. He studied painting in Rome, before being drawn to the burgeoning art scene in France, he made his way to Paris. There, he became part of the growing gathering of artists in the Montparnasse Quarter, making friends with Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Léonard Foujita, and some of the other future greats of the art world.

Manuel Ortiz de Zárate studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, developing his modernist skills in the painting of still lifes and landscapes. In 1916, he became Picasso&#x27;s art assistant. Between 1920 until 1940, Ortiz de Zárate showed his work at the Salon d’Automne, an annual art exhibition in Paris, France. Together with Camilo Mori and other artists from Chile, Manuel Ortiz de Zárate helped found the Grupo Montparnasse. During World War II, he remained in France despite the German occupation. After the war, he went to the United States where he died in 1946 in Los Angeles, California.

His daughter Laure Ortiz de Zárate was a costume designer and her first husband was the American abstract painter, John Ferren from 1932 until 1938; her second husband was the Russian-born production designer Eugène Lourié from 1941 until 1991.

<doc id="1154994" wikidata="Q72415" url="?curid=1154994" title="LPX (form factor)">
<text>LPX (short for Low Profile eXtension), originally developed by Western Digital, was a loosely defined motherboard format (form factor) widely used from 1987 to the late 1990s.

There was never any official LPX specification, but the design normally featured a motherboard with the main I/O ports mounted on the back (something that was later adopted by the ATX form factor), and a riser card in the center of the motherboard, on which the PCI and ISA slots were mounted. This layout was first used on IBM&#x27;s PS/2 Model 30 personal computer, which Western Digital used as the basis for the creation of LPX. Due to the lack of standardized specification, riser cards were seldom compatible from one motherboard design to another, much less one manufacturer to another. The internal PSU connector was of the same type used in the AT form factor.

One of the more successful features to come out of the LPX specification was its use of more compact power supplies, which later became widely used on Baby AT and even full size AT cases. Because LPX form factor power supplies became ubiquitous in most computer cases prior to the ATX standard, it was not unusual for manufacturers to refer to them as &quot;AT&quot; power supplies (or occasionally as &quot;PS/2&quot; power supplies due to its use by the IBM PS/2), even though the actual AT and Baby AT power supply form factors were larger in size. The LPX form factor power supply eventually formed the basis for the ATX form factor power supply, which is the same width and height.

The specification was very popular in the early-mid 1990s, and briefly displaced the AT form factor as the most commonly used. However, the release of the Pentium II in 1997 highlighted the flaws of the format, as a good airflow was important in Pentium II systems, owing to the relatively high heat dispersal requirements of the processor. LPX systems suffered a restricted airflow due to the centrally placed riser cards. The introduction of the AGP format further complicated matters, as the design not only increased the pin count on riser cards, but it limited most cards to one AGP, one PCI and one ISA slot, which was too restrictive for most users. Some lower-quality LPX boards didn&#x27;t even feature a real AGP slot, but simply used a physical AGP slot and connected it to the PCI bus. This was seldom noticed however, as many &quot;AGP&quot; graphics cards of the time were in fact PCI cards internally, and did not take advantage of the features offered by AGP.

LPX was phased out around 1998. NLX was the intended successor, though many manufacturers chose MicroATX or proprietary motherboard formats instead.

<text>The Hotel Negresco is a hotel and site of the restaurant &quot;Le Chantecler&quot;, located on the Promenade des Anglais on the Baie des Anges in Nice, France. It was named after Henri Negresco (1868–1920), who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the times, when the Negresco opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean Sea.

== History ==
Henri Negresco, born Alexandru Negrescu, was the son of an innkeeper. He was educated in Romania and began his professional career as a confectioner at the renowned Casa Capșa in Bucharest. At the age of 25—though some earlier sources suggest 15, which seems unlikely given that he completed military service in Romania and there is photographic evidence of him in Bucharest at an older age—Negresco left Romania. He first moved to Paris and later settled on the French Riviera, where he found considerable success. 

As director of the Municipal Casino in Nice, he had the idea to build a sumptuous hotel of quality that would attract the wealthiest of clients. After arranging the financing, he hired the great architect of the &quot;café society&quot; Édouard-Jean Niermans to design the hotel and its now famous pink dome. The spectacular Baccarat 16,309-crystal chandelier in the Negresco&#x27;s Royal Lounge was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II, who due to the October Revolution was unable to take delivery.

Contrary to popular belief, the large window of the Royal Lounge – listed as an Historical Monument – is not the work of Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel never worked at the Negresco; instead it is entirely the work of Edouard-Jean Niermans.

Henri Negresco faced a downturn in his affairs when World War I broke out two years after he opened for business. His hotel was converted to a hospital. By the end of the war, the number of wealthy visitors to the Riviera had dropped off to the point that the hotel was in severe financial difficulty. Seized by creditors, the Negresco was sold to a Belgian company. Henri Negresco died a few years later in Paris at the age of 52.

February 28, 1948, Suzy Delair sang &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot; in this hotel during the first Nice Jazz Festival. Louis Armstrong was present and loved the song. June 26, 1950, he recorded the American version of the song (English lyrics by Jerry Seelen) in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra. When it was released, the disc was a worldwide success and the song was then performed by the greatest international singers.

Over the years, the hotel had its ups and downs, and in 1957, it was sold to the Augier family. Madame reinvigorated the hotel with luxurious decorations and furnishings, including an outstanding art collection and rooms with mink bedspreads. She also popularised it with celebrities; Elton John featured it in the video for his song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot;, and she told Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, that purchasing it would be beyond his means.

Noted for its doormen dressed in the manner of the staff in 18th-century elite bourgeois households, complete with red-plumed postilion hats, the hotel also offers gourmet dining at the Regency-style &quot;Le Chantecler&quot; restaurant. Le Chantecler has two stars in the Guide Michelin and 15/20 in Gault Millau. It has previously been under the leadership of famous chefs such as Bruno Turbot and Alain Llorca, who left to take over the equally fabled Moulin de Mougins. The restaurant interior is decorated with gobelins and roccoco furniture in untraditional colourings such as pink, lime, lemon, and cerulean.

In 2003, the Hotel Negresco was listed by the government of France as a National Historic Building and is a member of Leading Hotels of the World. In total, the Hotel Negresco has a total of 119 guest rooms plus 22 suites.

==In contemporary times==
The fifth floor of the hotel is for &quot;VVIP&quot; guests, which stands for &quot;very, very important persons&quot;. The hotel has a private beach, which is located across the street from the facility.

In the wake of the 2016 Nice truck attack, the hotel&#x27;s main hall was used to triage wounded civilians.

The hotel hosted the opening ceremony of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on November 20, 2023.

<text>Edward Paul Jones (born October 5, 1950) is an American novelist and short story writer. He became popular for writing about the African-American experience in the United States, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the International Dublin Literary Award for &quot;The Known World&quot; (2003). 

Journalist Neely Tucker described Jones in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;arguably the greatest fiction writer the nation&#x27;s capital has ever produced&quot;. According to biographer Diane Brady of &quot;Fortune&quot;, Jones has been recognized &quot;as one of the finest writers of his generation&quot;. He has been a professor of creative writing at the University of Virginia, George Mason University, the University of Maryland, and Princeton University. In 2010, Jones became a professor of literature at George Washington University, where he was previously the Wang Visiting Professor in Contemporary English Literature.

== Early life and education ==
Jones was born in Washington, D.C., where he was raised in poor all-black neighborhoods. When he was two years old, his father, a Jamaican immigrant, left the family. Jones&#x27;s mother, Jeanette M. Jones, had been pregnant at the time with a third child, Jones&#x27; sister Eunice, who eventually died of lung cancer in 1973. Jones&#x27; only brother Joseph was born mentally disabled. The family resided in a series of impoverished shacks and tenements northwest of D.C.&#x27;s center, ultimately moving place-to-place 18 times in 18 years. 

Jones was recognized for talents in mathematics and literature as a child. At the age of five, Jones was sent to a Catholic school, where his performance enabled him to skip a grade, but his mother could not afford the tuition and withdrew him. He spent his early education at Walker-Jones Elementary School, Shaw Junior High School, then finally at the local Cardozo High School, where he performed well academically. Jones graduated as an honors student in English, although he had to sign his own report cards as his mother was illiterate.

In the fall of 1968, Jones enrolled into the College of the Holy Cross with the initial intent to study mathematics. He wrote for the school newspaper, &quot;The Crusader&quot;, and was a member of the college&#x27;s Black Student Union along with classmates Clarence Thomas, Ted Wells, and Ed Jenkins. After taking a nineteenth-century novel class at the college, Jones found a passion for writing. He graduated from Holy Cross with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in English in 1972.

In 1979, Jones entered the University of Virginia to pursue graduate studies in creative writing, receiving a Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in 1981.

== Career ==
His first book, &quot;Lost in the City&quot; (1992), is a collection of short stories about the African-American working class in 20th-century Washington, D.C. In the early stories are some who are like first-generation immigrants, as they have come to the city as part of the Great Migration from the rural South.

His second book, &quot;The Known World&quot;, was set in a fictional Virginia county and had a protagonist who was a Black planter and slaveholder. It won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 2005 International Dublin Literary Award.

Jones&#x27;s third book, &quot;All Aunt Hagar&#x27;s Children&quot;, was published in 2006. Like &quot;Lost in the City&quot;, it is a collection of short stories that deal with African Americans, mostly in Washington, D.C. Several of the stories had been previously published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. The stories in the book take up the lives of ancillary characters in &quot;Lost in the City&quot;. In 2007, it was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, which was won by Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;Everyman&quot;.

The stories of Jones&#x27; first and third book are connected. As Wyatt Mason wrote in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 2006:

The fourteen stories of &quot;All Aunt Hagar&#x27;s Children&quot; revisit not merely the city of Washington but the fourteen stories of &quot;Lost in the City&quot;. Each new story—and many of them, in their completeness, feel like fully realized little novels—is connected in the same sequence, as if umbilically, to the corresponding story in the first book. Literature is, of course, littered with sequels—its Rabbits and Bechs; its Zuckermans and Kepeshes—but this is not, in the main, Jones’s idea of a reprise. Each revisitation provides a different kind of interplay between the two collections.

Neely Tucker wrote in 2009:

In the spring and fall semesters of 2009, Jones was a visiting professor of creative writing at the George Washington University. In fall 2010 he joined the English department faculty to teach creative writing.

<text>The Drainie-Taylor Biography Prize was a Canadian literary award, presented by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada to a work judged as the year&#x27;s best work of biography, autobiography or personal memoir by a Canadian writer.

Created in 1998, the award was named in honour of Nathan A. Taylor, one of the country&#x27;s leading entertainment impresarios, and actor John Drainie. Writer and actor Claire Drainie Taylor, the award&#x27;s benefactor, was married to Drainie from 1942 until his death in 1966, and was subsequently married to Taylor until his death in 2004.

The first award was presented in November 1999. For the remainder of the award&#x27;s existence, however, the award was presented in the spring of the year following the year in which the eligible works were published. The final award was presented in March 2006 to honor works published in 2005.

The award was discontinued after 2006, in favour of an expanded prize package for the Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

<doc id="1155020" wikidata="Q7968402" url="?curid=1155020" title="War Crimes Act of 1996">
<text>The War Crimes Act of 1996 is a United States federal statute that defines a war crime to include a &quot;grave breach of the Geneva Conventions&quot;, specifically noting that &quot;grave breach&quot; should have the meaning defined in any convention (related to the laws of war) to which the United States is a party. The definition of &quot;grave breach&quot; in some of the Geneva Conventions have text that extend additional protections, but all the Conventions share the following text in common: &quot;... committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health.&quot;

The law applies if either the victim or the perpetrator is a national of the United States or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The penalty may be life imprisonment or death. The death penalty is only invoked if the conduct resulted in the death of one or more victims.

The Act was passed with overwhelming majorities by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

==Legislative history==
The law criminalized breaches of the Geneva Conventions so that the United States could prosecute war criminals, specifically North Vietnamese soldiers who imprisoned and tortured U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War. The Department of Defense &quot;fully support[ed] the purposes of the bill,&quot; recommending that it be expanded to include a longer list of war crimes. Because the United States generally followed the Conventions, the military recommended making breaches by U.S. military personnel war crimes as well &quot;because doing so set a high standard for others to follow.&quot; The bill passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House, showing that it was entirely uncontroversial at the time.

Ten years later, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to the War on Terrorism, with the unstated implication that any interrogation technique that violated Common Article 3 constituted war crimes. The possibility that American officials and military personnel could be prosecuted for war crimes for committing the &quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment&quot; prohibited by the Conventions led to a series of proposals to make such actions legal in certain circumstances, which resulted in the Military Commissions Act of 2006.

==Potential application==
White House officials were concerned that they and other U.S. officials could be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act of 1996 for the U.S. treatment of detainees after the September 11 attacks for violations of the Geneva Conventions. In a January 2002 memorandum to the president, then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales authored a controversial memo that explored whether Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants captured during the war in Afghanistan and held in detention facilities around the world, including Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing Common Article 3&#x27;s protections to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He concluded that Common Article 3 was outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He described as &quot;quaint&quot; the provisions that require providing captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants &quot;commissary privileges, scrip, athletic uniforms, and scientific instruments&quot;. He also argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Conventions would be applied. He also argued that undefined language in the Geneva Conventions, such as &quot;outrages upon personal dignity&quot; and &quot;inhuman treatment&quot;, could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if mistreatment was discovered.

The adoption of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 marked grave abuses of Common Article 3 to only include torture, cruel or inhumane treatment, murder, mutilation or maiming, intentionally causing serious bodily harm, rape, sexual assault or abuse, and the taking of hostages, thereby limiting the scope of the original law.

On December 6th, 2023, the first charges under this law were unsealed by the Department of Justice in a press conference by Attorney General Merrick Garland. The charges are against four Russian soldiers. The charges are based around a case as a result of the Russo-Ukrainian War, in which an American citizen living in Ukraine was detained by Russian soldiers for a period of 10 days in April 2022, during which he was allegedly tortured. However, the American government has no means to arrest the people charged.

<text>Civil awards and decorations are awarded to civilians for distinguished service or for eminence in a field of endeavour. Military personnel might also be eligible for services of a non-military nature. There are various forms of civil awards and decorations, including the following.

*Orders of chivalry, usually in several classes, for distinguished service to the government, the community, society or humanity. One example that is non-military in nature would be the British Order of St Michael and St George. Other orders may contain both military and civil divisions, such as the Order of the British Empire.
*State orders that are not orders of chivalry, for service to the government, the community, society or humanity. An example would be the Order of Canada, or certain Orders of the Russian Federation.
*Awards and decorations for service to the government or for eminence in a field of endeavour. Examples are the American Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service.
*Awards and decorations for bravery of civilians (including law enforcement and firefighting personnel). Examples would be the British George Cross, and the American Lifesaving Medal.
*Awards and decorations for distinguished service in law enforcement, firefighting and other services.
*Awards and decorations for long service in government, law enforcement, firefighting and other services.
*Awards and decorations that are international in nature, such as the United Nations Public Service Awards, the Nobel Prize, and Olympic medals.

On everyday occasions, only miniature insignia, often in the form of a circular rosette, are normally worn.

<text>The Journey Prize (officially called The Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada McClelland &amp; Stewart Journey Prize) is a Canadian literary award, presented annually by McClelland and Stewart and the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada for the best short stories published by an emerging writer in a Canadian literary magazine. The award was endowed by James A. Michener, who donated the Canadian royalty earnings from his 1988 novel &quot;Journey&quot;.

From the award&#x27;s inception until 2023, a single story was named the winner and received , making it the largest monetary award given in Canada to an up-and-coming writer for a short story or excerpt from a fiction work-in-progress. Since 2023, the award no longer select a single prize winners, and instead all of the 10 writers whose stories are selected for inclusion in the anthology are considered equal winners of the award and receive $1,000 each in prize money.

The prize&#x27;s winner in 2000, Timothy Taylor, was the first writer ever to have three stories nominated for the award in the same year.

The Journey Prize also publishes an annual anthology of the year&#x27;s longlisted short stories. Two writers, Andrew MacDonald and David Bergen, have both had a record four total stories selected for inclusion in the annual anthology.

In 2020, the Journey Prize committee announced that the upcoming award would be a special edition devoted exclusively to Black Canadian writers, considering stories published in multiple years. Although the initial report was that the special Black Canadian edition of the award would be presented in 2021 for stories published in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the organizers instead paused the award for 2021 and 2022, and presented a special Black Canadian award in early 2023 to honour works published since 2020.

In 2024, the 25th anniversary of the awards was marked with a special retrospective anthology, edited by Alexander MacLeod and Souvankham Thammavongsa, compiling selected winning and nominated stories from throughout the history of the awards.

<doc id="1155046" wikidata="Q1179850" url="?curid=1155046" title="De Dion-Bouton">
<text>De Dion-Bouton was a French automobile manufacturer and railcar manufacturer, which operated from 1883 to 1953. The company was founded by the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion, Georges Bouton, and Bouton&#x27;s brother-in-law Charles Trépardoux.

== Steam cars ==
The company was formed in 1883 after de Dion saw a toy locomotive in a store window in 1881 and asked the toymakers to build another. Engineers Bouton and Trépardoux had been eking out a living with scientific toys at a shop in the Passage de Léon, near the rue de la Chapelle in Paris. Trépardoux had long dreamed of building a steam car, but neither he nor Bouton could afford it.

De Dion, already inspired by steam in the form of railway locomotives, and with ample money, agreed to back them, and Trépardoux et Cie was formed in Paris in 1883. That became the De Dion-Bouton automobile company, the world&#x27;s largest automobile manufacturer for a time, well known for the quality, reliability, and durability of their vehicles.

Before 1883 was over, the company had set up shop in larger premises in the Passage de Léon, Paris, tried and dropped steam engines for boats, and produced a steam car. With the boiler and engine mounted at the front, driving the front wheels by belts and steering with the rear, it burned to the ground on trials. A second, &quot;La Marquise&quot;, was built the next year, with a more conventional steering and rear-wheel drive, capable of seating four.

The &quot;Marquis&quot; de Dion entered one of them in an 1887 trial, &quot;Europe&#x27;s first motoring competition&quot;, the brainchild of one M. Fossier of cycling magazine &quot;Le Vélocipède&quot;. Evidently, the promotion was insufficient, because De Dion was the sole entrant. It completed the course, with de Dion at the tiller, and was clocked at . That figure must be viewed with considerable care, because the first official land speed record, set in 1898, was . The vehicle survives, is in road-worthy condition, and has been a regular entry in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

Following that singular success, the company offered steam tricycles, with boilers between the front wheels and two-cylinder engines. They were built in small numbers, and were evidently a favorite of young playboys. They were later joined by a larger tractor, able to pull trailers (sometimes called a &quot;steam drag&quot;). That larger vehicle introduced the so-called De Dion or &quot;dead&quot; axle. An axle beam carried the weight of the vehicle with the non-weight-bearing driveshafts or drive chains articulated separately alongside it.

On 22 July 1894, during the Paris–Rouen race, it averaged over the 126 km (78 mi) route, but was disqualified because it needed both a driver and a stoker.

Two more cars were made in 1885, followed by a series of lightweight two-cylinder tricars which, from 1892, had Michelin pneumatic tyres. In 1893, steam tractors were introduced which were designed to tow horse-drawn carriages for passengers or freight (sometimes called &quot;steam drags&quot;) which used an innovative axle design that became known as the De Dion tube, where the location and drive function of the axle are separated.

The company manufactured steam buses and trucks until 1904. Trépardoux, a staunch supporter of steam, resigned in 1894 as the company turned to internal combustion vehicles. However, the steam car remained in production more or less unchanged for ten years more.

==Internal combustion engines==

=== Tricycles ===

By 1889, de Dion was becoming convinced the future lay in the internal combustion engine, and the company had built a ten-cylinder two-row rotary engine. After Trépardoux resigned in 1894, the company became &quot;De Dion, Bouton et Compagnie&quot;. For 1895, Bouton created a new one-cylinder engine with trembler coil ignition. Proving troublesome at its designed speed of 900 rpm (throwing bearings and running rough), when Bouton increased the revs, the problems vanished. In trials, it achieved an unprecedented 3500 rpm, and was usually run at 2,000 rpm, a limit imposed by its atmospheric valves and surface carburettor. Inlet and exhaust valves were overhead, and a flywheel was fitted to each end of the crankshaft.

This engine was fitted behind the rear axle of a tricycle frame bought from Decauville, fitted with the new Michelin pneumatic tires. It showed superb performance, and went on the market in 1896 with the engine enlarged to 1¼ CV (horsepower) (932 W) , with 1¾ CV (1.3 kW) in 1897. By the time production of the &quot;petite voiture&quot; tricar stopped in 1901, it had 2¾ CV (2 kW), while racers had as much as 8 CV (6 kW).

In 1898, Louis Renault had a De Dion-Bouton modified with fixed drive shaft and ring and pinion gear, making &quot;perhaps the first hot rod in history&quot;.

=== Four wheelers ===
The same year, the tricar was joined by a four-wheeler and in 1900 by a &quot;vis a vis&quot; &quot;voiturette&quot;, the Model D, with its 3¾ CV (2.8 kW) single-cylinder engine under the seat and drive to the rear wheels through a two-speed gearbox. This curious design had the passenger facing the driver, who sat in the rear seat. The &quot;voiturette&quot; had one inestimable advantage: the expanding clutches of the gearbox were operated by a lever on the steering column. The Model D was developed through Models E, G, I, and J, with 6 CV (4.5 kW) by 1902, when the 8 CV (6 kW) Model K rear-entry phaeton appeared, with front-end styling resembling the contemporary Renault. Until World War I, De Dion-Boutons had an unusual decelerator pedal which reduced engine speed and ultimately applied a transmission brake. In 1902, the Model O introduced three speeds, which was standard for all De Dion-Boutons in 1904.

A small number of electric cars were also made in 1901.

=== Engine supplier to automobile manufacturers ===
De Dion-Bouton supplied engines to vehicle manufacturers such as Hanzer and Société Parisienne who mounted a unit directly on the front axle of their front-wheel-drive voiturette the &#x27;Viktoria Combination&#x27;.

== Engine supplier to motor bicycle builders ==
The De Dion-Bouton engine is considered the first high-speed lightweight internal combustion engine. It was licensed to more than 150 manufacturers and was a popular choice among assemblers of motor bicycles. The small, lightweight four-cycle engine used a battery and coil ignition that was less trouble than hot tube ignition. The bore of and stroke of gave the engine an output of . It was used on many pioneering motor bicycles, and was widely copied by makers including US Brands Indian and Harley-Davidson.

== American De Dion ==
In 1900, the De Dion-Bouton Motorette Company began manufacturing De Dion-Bouton automobiles under license in Brooklyn, New York. A small quantity of American De Dion Motorettes were made. They had either two-seater vis-a-vis or closed coachwork, and were powered by a American-made engines.

The venture was in operation for only one year, and the cars gained a reputation for unreliability during that time. Representatives of De Dion in the United States claimed that the licensee had violated the contract and advertised for a new licensee.

== Expansion ==

In 1900, De Dion-Bouton was the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing 400 cars and 3,200 engines. The company soon began producing engines and licenses for other automobile companies, with an estimate of 150 makes using them. Production was so great, that it proved impossible to test every engine. If one failed on the bench, it was simply disassembled. Every engine was being made by hand because the assembly line had not yet been introduced. By 1904, some 40,000 engines had been supplied across Europe. That year, De Dion-Bouton&#x27;s factory at Quai National (now Quai de Dion-Bouton), Puteaux, employed 1,300 people and produced more than 2,000 cars, all hand-made.

The engine moved to the front in 1903 in the Populaire, which had a engine, the latter being powerful enough to allow trucks to be added to cars, and by the end of the year, a reverse gear had also appeared. It was joined by the 6 CV (4 kW) 864 cc (52.5 in3) Types N and Q (the latter a low-priced K), the 8 CV (6 kW) R, and their first multi-cylinder model, the two-cylinder 1728 cc (105 in3) 12 CV (8 kW) S, followed in 1904 by the four-cylinder 15 CV (11 kW) Type AD and 24 CV (18 kW) AI. The cars were also becoming more and more conventional in styling, with the radiator moving in front of the engine and the clutch changing from a hand lever to a pedal.

A pair of works 10 CV (7.5 kW) De Dion-Boutons, in the hands of Cormier and Collignon, ran in the 1907 Peking to Paris rally, without success. Bouvier St. Chaffray did no better in the New York to Paris in 1908. That year, De Dion-Bouton peaked as a manufacturer.

The company became the first to make a successful mass-produced V8 engine, a 35 CV (26 kW) CJ in 1910, followed by a 7.8 liter and a 14.7 liter for the U.S., as well as by a Type CN in 1912. (They trailed Ader in racing the 1906 Adams, which used an Antoinette aircraft engine.) This would be the company&#x27;s last innovation.

During World War I, the company made gun parts, armoured vehicles, and aircraft engines, as well as cars and trucks. Between 1913 and 1918, it produced an anti-aircraft weapons system for the French Army, consisting of a Canon de 75 modèle 1897 field gun mounted on a V8-powered De Dion-Bouton truck.

In Dublin, during the Easter Rising of 1916, which began the Irish War of Independence, The O&#x27;Rahilly drove his De Dion Bouton up to the Irish HQ in O&#x27;Connell Street and, discovering that the Rising he had planned and trained soldiers for, and then tried to prevent, was actually happening, he drove it into a barricade, walked into the GPO and said: &quot;I&#x27;ve helped to wind the clock, I&#x27;ve come to hear it strike.&quot; He was killed in a charge against a machine gun nest in Moore Street days later. A famous photograph shows the skeleton of the car in its barricade.

== Postwar stagnation ==
The company stagnated after World War I. The V8 continued to appear until 1923 and, in spite of new models with front-wheel brakes, the factory closed for much of 1927. On reopening, two models were listed, the Type LA, with a four-cylinder overhead valve, aluminium-piston engine, and the Type LB, with a straight-8. The latter was very expensive and sales were few, despite an increase in engine size growth to in 1930. A rumored takeover by Peugeot or Mercedes did not materialize, leading to the end of passenger car production in 1932.

== After World War II ==
Small numbers of commercial vehicles were made until 1950, and the last vehicles to carry the De Dion badge were license-made Land Rovers in the early 1950s. The company name was bought by a motorcycle maker in 1955.

== Railcars ==

De Dion-Bouton built railcars and railcar trailers used on many of the metre gauge railways in France and abroad. The first railcars were produced in the early 1920s, with the Chemin de Fer des Côtes-du-Nord receiving its first vehicles in 1923.

<text>Cricket is a darts game that uses the 
standard 20 number dartboard with the triple and double rings.

==Gameplay==
Cricket is typically played between 2, 3 or 4 players, or teams of players, although the rules do not discount more players. The goal of cricket is to be the first player to open or close all the cricket numbers and have a higher or even point total.

===Cricket numbers===
Cricket uses the numbers 15 to 20 (or sometimes 10 to 20, and less frequently a predetermined selection of numbers) and the bullseye. To open or close a number, it must have been scored three times in any fashion, on one or more turns. Hitting the triple can open or close a number in one throw; a single and the double can open or close it in two throws or three singles can open or close it in three throws. Except in strict variants which count down from 20 to 15, numbers do not have to be opened or closed in any particular order and several numbers can be hit in the same turn. A scoreboard is used to keep track of the hits on all the numbers. Hitting a number once is shown by placing a slash (/) beside the number, second hit by turning the slash to an X, and the third by a circle (O) around the X.

===Scoring===
The object is for a player to hit each number and the bullseye three times. Doubles count as two hits and triples as three. The outer bullseye counts as one and the inner bullseye as two.
The first player to hit a number three times owns that number and it is said to be &quot;opened&quot;. Further hits on the opened number score that number of points (e.g. triple 20 gains 60 points) until the opponent also hits that number three times and &quot;closes&quot; it, then that number is removed from play. The double ring scores double the number&#x27;s value and the triple (inner) ring scores triple the number&#x27;s value. The outer bullseye ring is worth 25 points and the inner circle (or double bull) is worth 50. Once a player has opened or closed all the required numbers and bull and has equal or more points than his opponent, that player wins. Also, if a player scores and does not record it before the next player goes, that score does not count.

Alternatively, cut-throat style scoring can be used, in which case points are undesirable; hitting a number that is opened results in points being given to any other players who do not have that number closed, and the lowest score wins.

===Playing===
To start the game, each player or one player from each team throws one dart. This is known as the &quot;diddle&quot;. The player whose dart lands closest to the center goes first. Generally, if both players&#x27; darts are in the same section of the bullseye, or in the event of a tie, each player throws another dart until there is an obvious winner. During a player&#x27;s turn, the player throws three darts. After the last dart, the player&#x27;s score is totaled. Any number that has not been hit three times (cumulative across all turns) by a player is neither open for that player nor closed (if currently open for the opponent).

====Example game====
* Player 1 opens the game by throwing a triple 20, then a single 20 and a double 18.At the end of Player 1&#x27;s turn the 20 is opened and he has scored 20 points. The 18 will require one more hit to open it.The Score is 20 – 0 (as the player hit an S20 after opening)
* Player 2 throws next and hits a single 20, the triple 20 and a triple 16.At the end of Player 2&#x27;s turn the 20 is closed, but he does not score since player 1 already opened it, and the 16 is opened.The Score is still 20 – 0 (as player 2 closed the 20s and hitting a number that is closed does not score. The player also opened 16)
* Player 1 now tries to open the 18s but hits the S1 and the S4 and the S20.At the end of player 1&#x27;s second turn there is no score change.The Score is still 20 – 0 (As only 15-20 &amp; bull are used in Cricket and 20 was closed by player 2)
* Player 2 throws a triple 16, a single 19, and a double 19.At the end of player 2&#x27;s second turn he has scored 48 points at the 16s and opened the 19s.The Score is 20 – 48.
* Player 2 can continue to score on the 16s and 19s on each of his turns until player 1 closes them.

Play continues until all of the numbers have been opened (or closed) by the higher-scoring player. If one player/team is the only one with open numbers remaining and are also leading in points, the game can be called early as it is impossible for others to catch up.

If a player strikes Triple 13, bar culture dictates the thrower takes a shot of their choice

===Teams===
This game can also be played by teams of 2 or even more persons. In some variations, when played with more than 2 teams, the system of points is replaced by penalty points, also known as cut-throat scoring. With penalty points the points score on every team that has not closed the number and the low point total wins the game.

==Cricket variations==
Multiple variations exist on the standard theme of hitting each number 3 times to close, followed by scoring points on closed numbers until all players have closed a given number. Standard scoring is the norm, but Cut-throat scoring may also be used in all variations where points are used rather than runs.

===Camden Throwdown===
Play is the same as traditional but without scoring after closing a number. The game ends when one player closes all of the numbers listed and that player is then the winner. In this way Camden Throwdown (CT) variations can be applied to most sports and structured activities where more than half of the rules and regulations are thrown out in lieu of a simpler and more streamlined version.

===Scram===
The Scram variation is played with 2 players or teams. As in standard Cricket, Scram can use all the numbers on the board minus the bullseye, the numbers 15 through 20 and the bullseye, or random number selections. Like with most dart games, 3 darts are thrown each turn per player. If teams are used, turns alternate between opposing players, i.e. Team 1, Player 1 -&gt; Team 2, Player 1 -&gt; Team 1, Player 2 -&gt; Team 2, Player 2, etc.

Numbers can be closed in the standard fashion i.e. hitting a single 3 times, hitting a double and a single, hitting a triple, etc. A closing variation, when using only the numbers 1-20, is a single hit on a number closes it out. Standard scoring is used, i.e. a triple 17 is worth 51 points.

Player/Team 1 starts as the &quot;Blocker&quot; and Player/Team 2 as the &quot;Scorer.&quot; The Blocker throws first and attempts to close as many numbers as possible. The Scorer follows and attempts to score as many points as possible, on still open numbers, before the blocker can close all of the numbers. Once all the numbers have been closed, the round ends, and the Scorer tallies their points. The Players/Teams then switch roles and continue, with the new Blocker throwing first. The Player/Team with the most points is the winner.

===Bowlers and Batters===
The Bowlers and Batters variation, also known as English Cricket, uses all the numbers on the board, and is a two player/team game. Based on the bat and ball game of Cricket, one team/player will &quot;bat&quot; while the other &quot;bowls&quot;. The batting side aims to accumulate as many runs as possible before the bowling side takes ten wickets. A bullseye counts as two wickets, the outer bull counts as one. If the batting side consider themselves far enough ahead, they can also declare, as in cricket. The first 40 points of the batter&#x27;s score on each turn is deducted, and the remainder count as runs, so a score of 180 would add 140 runs, whereas a score of 36 would add no runs. As in field cricket, the batter and bowler roles are then switched. The winner is the side which accumulated the most runs before being bowled out.

===Tactics===
Tactics is the UK version of Cricket, and is almost the same as described above in Gameplay. However, Tactics, in addition to 20 through 15 and the bull&#x27;s-eye, also uses Doubles and Triples as separate scoring objectives. Three of each number along with three bulls, three doubles, and three triples are required to complete the game. In addition the first player to close all objectives must have a tied score or better to win.

There are two ways of playing Tactics, &#x27;slop&#x27; and &#x27;strict&#x27;. In Slop Rules Tactics, all doubles and triples count, while in Strict Tactics, only the doubles and triples from 15 through 20 count.

The major tactical difference in game play between Tactics and Cricket is the introduction of Triples and Doubles as objectives. The player is offered a choice as to how these may be applied to his/her score. If 20 has been closed by only one player and that player hits the triple 20, they have the option of taking the 60 points, or applying this as one of their three required &#x27;triple&#x27; hits. If 20 has been closed by both players, but triples have only been closed by one, that player can still use the hit to score 60 points on the triple 20. Depending on your darts, your partners darts, your opponents darts, and the stage of the game, it may be tactical to use the score one way or another. 

Other versions played in Canada and in the USA are similar to the above but using the numbers 20 down through 13 and 20 through 12 respectively.

<text>The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour is a 60-minute package show produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1976 for ABC Saturday mornings. It marked the first new installments of the cowardly canine since 1973, and contained two animated segments: &quot;The Scooby-Doo Show&quot; and &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour&quot; debuted on September 11, 1976. After two months, an additional 30 minutes were added to the hour-long series (to accommodate repeats of the first two CBS seasons of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;), becoming the 90-minute &quot;Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show,&quot; which is how it remained from December 4, 1976 to September 3, 1977.

Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
The entire series was released on DVD as &quot;The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour: The Complete Series&quot; on Tuesday, March 7, 2006 by Warner Home Video (via Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment). However, the episodes contained therein are not the original 1976 broadcast versions (which would have included only one opening and closing credits sequence per episode), but the separate syndicated versions of &quot;The Scooby-Doo Show&quot; and &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;. Some of the original &quot;Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour&quot; bridging sequences from 1976 (the opening to the Dynomutt segment and the original end credits, both featuring Scooby-Doo) were used periodically when &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot; aired as part of the &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot; from spring 1984 to summer 1992 (the 1978 syndicated titles were shown as well).

<text>Thomas LeRoy Collins (March 10, 1909 – March 12, 1991) was an American politician who served as the 33rd governor of Florida from 1955 to 1961. Collins began his governorship after winning a special election in 1954, and was elected to a four-year term in 1956.

Prior to winning election as governor, Collins served several terms in the Florida House of Representatives and Senate. He was the first governor from the South to promote ending segregation. Counseling &quot;progress under law,&quot; he took a moderate course in favor of incremental improvements during the 1950s and 60s and is remembered as a voice in favor of civil rights.

==Early life==
Collins, &quot;an example of the poor boy made good,&quot; was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, son of a &quot;neighborhood grocer&quot;. He attended Leon High School. He went on to attend Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and then the Cumberland School of Law, at that time in Lebanon, Tennessee, where he earned a law degree. In 1932, he married Mary Call Darby, great-granddaughter of Richard K. Call, twice territorial governor of Florida.

==Start of career==
===Political start===
Collins was first elected to public office in 1934, as Leon County&#x27;s representative to the Florida House of Representatives. He continued to serve in the House until 1940, when he was elected to the Florida Senate to fill an unexpired term of the late William Hodges.

In 1941, he purchased The Grove Plantation, the house built by Richard K. Call in Tallahassee across the street from the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Re-elected to the Senate in 1942, Collins resigned to join the military for World War II.

===Military service===
Collins attempted to enlist in 1943, but was rejected by the United States Navy because of his age. In 1944, he was accepted and received his commission as a lieutenant junior grade. He attended officer training first in Hollywood, Florida, and then in Princeton, New Jersey. Originally slated for assignment to a unit that would oversee post-war rebuilding of countries previously held by the Japanese, he began training in the Chinese language in Monterey, California. When the unit was disbanded, Collins was transferred to the Navy&#x27;s judge advocate general corps. He was posted to the 13th Naval District headquarters in Seattle, Washington, where he was assigned as an attorney for Navy boards and courts. Collins was discharged from active duty as a lieutenant in March 1946, and returned to Florida to resume his legal and political career.

===Return to politics===
After the war, in 1946 he was elected again to the Florida Senate. He was re-elected in 1950, serving until 1954. That year a special election was held to fill the remaining two years in the term of Governor Daniel T. McCarty, who had died in office in 1953.

Collins twice received the title of &quot;Most Valuable Senator&quot; (the first time in 1947 by the Capital Press Corps and in 1953 by fellow lawmakers).

==Governorship==
Governor McCarty died on September 28, 1953, just nine months after assuming office, having suffered a debilitating heart attack on February 25. At that time, Florida had no lieutenant governor, and the president of the Florida Senate, Charley Eugene Johns, became acting governor to serve until a special election.

Collins challenged Johns in the 1954 Democratic primary election and won the nomination. Due to the disenfranchisement of most blacks in the South, the Democratic Party dominated regional politics and a primary win nearly guaranteed victory in the general election. Collins was sworn in as governor on January 4, 1955. In 1956, he was reelected to serve a regular four-year term, Collins was the first governor of Florida to serve two consecutive terms.

In the 1956 election, Collins made history by becoming the first governor to win the Democratic nomination without a runoff election, defeating segregationist Sumter de Leon Lowry Jr. and four other Democrats with over 51 percent of the vote. During his term, Collins focused on education, working to strengthen the state&#x27;s school system. In the racial unrest caused by the Civil Rights Movement seeking enforcement of constitutional rights, he took a moderate course, counseling obedience to the law, though gradually, to avoid disruption. The state had minimal disorder compared to other states in the Deep South.

Although he initially condemned the US Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), as did almost all Southern elected officials, he fought with the Florida Legislature to try to prevent them from passing an &quot;interposition&quot; resolution. This indicated the intent of the legislature to &quot;interpose&quot; itself between the citizens of Florida and the United States government to prevent what the legislature contended was an illegal intrusion upon the right of the state by imposing integration.

Collins prevented passage of the resolution the first time by using his power under Section 10 of Article Four of the state constitution to unilaterally adjourn the legislature. After the legislature returned and passed the resolution, Collins could not veto it, because it was not a proposed law but only a resolution expressing the sentiments of the legislature.

When the interposition resolution reached his office, Collins noted on it the following, in his own handwriting:

The document is held by the State Archives of Florida.

In 1955, Collins personally reviewed the case of the Groveland Four, a case that had been unjust to four black men. Two of these men had been murdered during the case, an underage boy was given life in prison, and Walter Irvin was sentenced to death for a rape where there was little to no evidence against him. Collins decided to commute Irvin&#x27;s sentence to life in prison, explaining: &quot;My conscience told me it was a bad case, badly handled, badly tried ... I was asked to take a man&#x27;s life. My conscience would not let me do it.&quot;

Collins became Chairman of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association in 1957.

Collins fell just a few votes short of persuading the first Constitution Revision Commission to send an amendment to voters to abolish capital punishment in the state. He later recalled that he worked for the amendment because every time an execution was carried out under his order, it left him feeling nearly as guilty as the murderers. His two immediate successors, C. Farris Bryant and Haydon Burns, also opposed the death penalty.

===Speech on race relations, March 20, 1960===
Though Collins is now remembered as a voice for civil rights, in his campaign for Florida&#x27;s governorship he had identified as a staunch segregationist who regarded the practice as &quot;part and parcel of our way of life.&quot; Yet biographer Martin Dyckman argues that, in his speeches and statements, Collins never extolled segregation as a virtue, but defended it legalistically. For instance, although he took issue with the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, he acknowledged the court&#x27;s authority. By 1957 Collins was expressing doubts that whites would universally react negatively to integration (though he still criticized the NAACP for &quot;forcing the issue&quot;).

Tensions were mounting in Tallahassee as 1960 neared. Bus boycotts and lunch counter sit-ins were taking place in Tallahassee and across Florida. On March 20, 1960, against the advice of his friends, Collins gave an impassioned speech about his conviction that as governor he represented all the people of Florida, &quot;whether that person is black or white, whether that person is rich or poor, or whether that person is influential or not influential.&quot; He was the first southern governor to speak so frankly in support of the moral necessity of the end of segregation. His speech generated hundreds of responses, mostly positive, from citizens across the state.

Collins&#x27; reputation as a moderate secured him the chairmanship of the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Some historians believed he had a good chance for the vice-presidential nomination, but the party nominated Lyndon Johnson in order to win Texas voters to support the ticket with John F. Kennedy from Boston.

===Presidential and vice-presidential possibilities===
During the 1956 Democratic National Convention, Collins was among contenders for the vice presidential nomination, when presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson II allowed the convention to choose his running-mate. Collins received 29 votes on the first ballot.

Before the 1960 presidential election, Collins was seriously considered as a possible candidate because of his popularity as a Southern governor. He was also acceptable to Northern liberals because of his support for civil rights. But he did not seek the nomination, even in the Florida primary, which went to favorite son candidate Senator George Smathers.

===Chairman of the 1960 Democratic National Convention===

Collins served as chairman of the 1960 Democratic National Convention, which nominated Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts for President and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas for Vice President.

==Post-governorship==
Upon completion of six years as governor, he became president of the National Association of Broadcasters. He resigned this at the request of President Lyndon B. Johnson to become the first Director of the Community Relations Service under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Also by presidential appointment, he became United States Under Secretary of Commerce on July 7, 1965. He resigned this position effective October 1, 1966 to return to Florida to become a partner in a Tampa law firm.

In 1968, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for the United States Senate seat vacated by fellow Democrat George Smathers. However, he lost the general election to Republican U.S. Representative Edward Gurney. Gurney partisans distributed a photograph of Collins walking alongside the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., during the second of the March 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama. The photograph contained no caption or other explanation of why Collins was in Selma. In fact, Collins had not participated in the march, but had shuttled back and forth between the marchers and the Alabama authorities to pursue a compromise to avoid a repeat of the violence perpetrated two days earlier, by state troopers and a deputized county posse, on the county side of the Edmund Pettus Bridge during the &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; march. He conducted these negotiations as a part of his job as head of the Community Relations Service, at the behest of President Lyndon B. Johnson. He succeeded, as the marchers were allowed to cross the bridge, pray, and return to the other side, completing the &quot;Turnaround Tuesday&quot; march.

A death penalty opponent, Collins participated in a protest against execution of John Spenkelink in 1979. This was the first post-Furman involuntary execution in the U.S. and the first in Florida since 1964. The protest was held outside the gubernatorial mansion he had once occupied. (Then-Governor Bob Graham let the execution proceed.)

After Collins&#x27; defeat in the Senate race, he left his law firm in Tampa and returned to &quot;The Grove&quot; in Tallahassee, where he lived until his death from cancer in 1991. He was called &quot;the greatest Governor of Florida&quot; by former governors Reubin Askew, Bob Graham, and Jeb Bush.

==Family==
His son, LeRoy Collins Jr., a retired United States Navy rear admiral, unsuccessfully sought the 2006 Republican nomination for the United States Senate from Florida, losing to Congresswoman Katherine Harris. She was defeated by Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent.

==Legacy and honors==
*On March 19, 1991, a tribute was entered in the official record of the United States House of Representatives by Florida Representatives James Bacchus and Charles E. Bennett
*His papers are held by the University of South Florida, and a road on the university&#x27;s Tampa campus is named after him
*The Leon County Public Library is named after him.

<doc id="1155057" wikidata="Q2514249" url="?curid=1155057" title="Studding sail">
<text>A studding sail, or stun&#x27;sl (pronounced stuns&#x27;l ) is an extra sail on a square rigged vessel for use in fair weather. It is set outside the square sails, using stun&#x27;sl booms which run out along the yards. They came into use some time in the middle of the 17th century and by the beginning of the 19th century were usual on all square rigged sailing vessels. They started to become less common in the last quarter of the 19th century, as the economies of smaller crews and avoidance of damage to the ship&#x27;s gear became more important than a fast voyage.

== History ==

The origins of studding sails are relatively uncertain. The earliest reference is in 1655, but precise information on how these early examples were rigged is unknown. It is not until 1790 that this is available. Some changes in the detail of design and usage occurred over succeeding years.

All ordinary working square-rigged vessels were usually fitted out to set stun&#x27;sls by the start of the 19th century. This started to change in the last quarter of the 19th century. As steamers took over routes and cargoes that needed fast passages, sailing vessels competed by being able to cut costs much more easily. Crew sizes were reduced, so there were fewer experienced hands to set and take in stun&#x27;sls. Any ship which pressed on in rising winds risked breaking a stun&#x27;sl boom or damaging sailsif the owner had all or some of the stun&#x27;sls sent ashore, there was less to break and these repair costs avoided. Clippers on the routes to China continued to race against each other with large crews and full suits of sails (which included stun&#x27;sls) until they also had their trade taken over by steamers in the years following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. As these ships took other routes, most of them had the same economies applied.

== Description ==

A studding sail is an extra sail hoisted alongside a square-rigged sail. It is named from the mast that it is set alongside: top-gallant studding sail, topmast studding sail and lower studding sail. These sails provide extra speed in fine weather.

<text>Marquis Jules Félix Philippe Albert de Dion de Wandonne (; 9 March 185619 August 1946) was a French pioneer of the automobile industry. He invented a steam-powered car and used it to win the world&#x27;s first auto race, but his vehicle was adjudged to be against the rules. He was a co-founder of De Dion-Bouton, the world&#x27;s largest automobile manufacturer for a time, as well as the French sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;.

==His life==

Dion was the heir of a leading French noble family, in 1901 succeeding his father Louis Albert William Joseph de Dion de Wandonne as Count and later Marquis. A &quot;notorious duellist&quot;, he also had a passion for mechanics. He had already built a model steam engine when, in 1881, he saw one in a store window and asked about building another. The engineers, Georges Bouton and his brother-in-law, Charles Trépardoux, had a shop in Léon where they made scientific toys. Needing money for Trépardoux&#x27;s long-time dream of a steam car, they acceded to De Dion&#x27;s request.

During 1883, they formed a partnership which became the De Dion-Bouton automobile company, the world&#x27;s largest automobile manufacturer for a time. They tried marine steam engines, but progressed to a steam car which used belts to drive the front wheels whilst steering with the rear. This was destroyed by fire during trials. In 1884, they built another, &quot;La Marquise&quot;, with steerable front wheels and drive to the rear wheels. As of 2011, it is the world&#x27;s oldest running car, and is capable of carrying four people at up to .

&quot;Comte&quot; de Dion entered one in an 1887 trial, &quot;Europe&#x27;s first motoring competition&quot;, the brainchild of M. Paul Faussier of cycling magazine &quot;Le Vélocipède Illustré&quot;. Evidently, the promotion was insufficient, for the de Dion was the sole entrant, but it completed the course.

The de Dion tube (or &#x27;dead axle&#x27;) was actually invented by steam advocate Trépardoux, just before he resigned because the company was turning to internal combustion.

In 1898, he co-founded the Salon de l&#x27;Automobile (Paris Motor Show).

He died in 1946, age 90, and is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. There is a memorial plaque in the family chapel in Wandonne, south of Audincthun in the Pas-de-Calais.

==Racing career==

Motor racing was started in France as a direct result of the enthusiasm with which the French public embraced the motor car. Manufacturers were enthusiastic due to the possibility of using motor racing as a shop window for their cars. The first motor race took place on 22 July 1894 and was organised by &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, a Parisian newspaper. It was run over the distance between Paris and Rouen. The race was won by de Dion, although he was not awarded the prize for first place as his steam-powered car required a stoker and the judges deemed this outside of their requirements.

==Dreyfus affair and &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;==

The roots of both the Tour de France cycle race and &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;), a daily sporting newspaper, can be traced to the Dreyfus affair and de Dion&#x27;s passionate anti-dreyfusard opinion and actions.

Opinions were heated and there were demonstrations by both sides in the Dreyfus affair. Historian Eugen Weber described an 1899 conflagration at the Auteuil horse-race course in Paris as &quot;an absurd political shindig&quot; when, among other events, de Dion struck the President of France, Émile Loubet, on the head with a walking stick. De Dion served 15 days in jail and was fined 100 French francs, and his behaviour was heavily criticised by &quot;Le Vélo&quot;, the largest daily sports newspaper in France, and its Dreyfusard editor, Pierre Giffard.

As a result, de Dion withdrew all his advertising from the paper, and in 1900, he led a group of wealthy &quot;anti-Dreyfusard&quot; manufacturers, including Édouard Michelin and Adolphe Clément, to start a rival daily sports paper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Vélo&quot;, and compete directly with &quot;Le Vélo&quot;. De Dion and Michelin were also concerned with &quot;Le Vélo&quot; – which reported more than cycling – because its financial backer was one of their commercial rivals, the Darracq company. De Dion believed that &quot;Le Vélo&quot; gave Darracq too much attention and him too little. After a legally enforced change of name to &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, it in turn created the Tour de France race in 1903 to boost falling circulation.

De Dion was an outspoken man who already wrote columns for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;Le Matin&quot; and others. His wealth allowed him to indulge his whims, which also included refounding &quot;Le Nain jaune&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Gnome&quot;), a fortnightly publication which &quot;answers no particular need.&quot;

<doc id="1155076" wikidata="Q2395696" url="?curid=1155076" title="Dynomutt, Dog Wonder">
<text>Dynomutt, Dog Wonder is an American animated television series created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired on ABC from September 11, 1976, to October 1, 1977. The show centers on a Batman-esque superhero, the Blue Falcon, and his assistant, Dynomutt, a bumbling, yet effective robotic dog who can produce a seemingly infinite number of mechanical devices from his body. As with many other animated superheroes of the era, no origins for the characters are ever provided.

&quot;Dynomutt&quot; was originally broadcast as a half-hour segment of &quot;The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour&quot; (1976–77), and a quarter-hour segment of its later expanded form &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics&quot; (1977–78); it would later be rerun and syndicated on its own from 1978 on. The cast of &quot;The Scooby-Doo Show&quot; appeared as recurring characters on &quot;Dynomutt&quot;, assisting the Daring Duo in cracking their crimes. Originally distributed by Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s then-parent company Taft Broadcasting, Warner Bros. Television currently holds the distribution rights to the series.

==Overview==
Millionaire socialite art dealer Radley Crown (voiced by Gary Owens) and his mechanical pet dog Dynomutt (voiced by Frank Welker, who got the inspiration for the voice from the Gertrude and Heathcliff characters of Red Skelton) enjoy leisure time in their base of operations in Big City until alerted by the Falcon Flash. They then immediately dash to the Falcon&#x27;s Lair (situated in Crown&#x27;s penthouse), where they switch to their secret identities, the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, respectively. The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt receive the report via TV screen from the secret GHQ of secret agent F.O.C.U.S. One (voiced by Ron Feinberg), jumps into the Falconcar and speeds into the fray against assorted evildoers.

In a coup similar to the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, the first 10 minutes of &quot;Dynomutt&quot; ends with a cliffhanger wherein the Daring Duo, in the clutches of their foes, are subjected to a perilous fate which is resolved immediately after the commercial. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contains a laugh track created by the studio.

The metallic dog employs a system of miniaturized transistors that allow him to extend his limbs or neck and use them to perform extraordinary feats; however, none of them ever work properly. &quot;B.F.&quot; (as Dynomutt lovingly refers to him) is more Dynomutt&#x27;s victim than his master, forever being hamstrung by the latter&#x27;s insufferably clumsy mechanized mishaps, which often results in the Blue Falcon calling Dynomutt &quot;Dog Blunder&quot;. Nevertheless, Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon, equipped with their arsenal of super gadgetry, manage to get the situation well in hand.

Three episodes had a crossover with &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.

But the show stopped airing on Boomerang due to the re-branding that happened on January 19, 2015, that also removed many other older shows.

==Home media==
All 16 episodes of the first season were released in a DVD set &quot;The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour: The Complete Series&quot; from Warner Home Video.

==Blue Falcon==

===Appearances===
====Television series====
* Gary Owens and Frank Welker reprise their roles of the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt in guest appearances in the &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; episode &quot;Dyno-Might&quot;. The Blue Falcon comes to Dexter when Dynomutt is heavily damaged during their fight with the supervillain, Buzzord (voiced by Rob Paulsen). Though Dexter obliges, Dynomutt destroys his laboratory, leading to Dexter deactivating Dynomutt and creating Dynomutt X-90 (also voiced by Welker), who becomes a fanatical vigilante using excessive and lethal force to deal with minor crimes such as parking violations, jaywalking, and littering. Dexter tries to help the Blue Falcon stop Dynomutt X-90, but after being cornered, Dexter reveals he built Dynomutt X-90 because he deemed the original a goofy idiot sidekick. The Blue Falcon states Dynomutt was not just a goofy idiot sidekick, he was a go-go dog person. He then reactivates the original Dynomutt, who arrives and distracts Dynomutt X-90 enough for Dexter to deactivate him.
* Dynomutt&#x27;s picture made a cameo in an episode of the &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; segment, &quot;Super Secret Secret Squirrel&quot;.
* Owens reprises his role as the Blue Falcon in the &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; episode &quot;Johnny Makeover&quot; wherein he, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and Don Knotts redesign Johnny&#x27;s show in a parody of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;.
* The Blue Falcon appears as a recurring character in the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; TV series and once in the video game of the same title as a Spanish lawyer named Antonio de Rivera Garcia Azul Falcón (voiced by Maurice LaMarche). A similarly Spanish-accented Dynomutt also appeared in the two-part episode &quot;Deadomutt&quot;, voiced by André Sogliuzzo.
* Blue Falcon and Dynomutt appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Ban on the Fun&quot;, voiced by Kevin Shinick and Victor Yerrid.
* Blue Falcon and Dynomutt appeared in the &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; episode &quot;Heart of Evil&quot;, with the Blue Falcon being voiced by Troy Baker while Welker reprised his role of Dynomutt. This series depicts an origin where Radley and his dog Reggie were security guards at Quest Labs. After a robot dragon attacks and injures Reggie&#x27;s organic body, Dr. Benton Quest rebuilds him as a cyborg dog. While Dynomutt retains his personality from the original series, the Blue Falcon is depicted as a gritty and violent vigilante reminiscent of Batman in Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;.
* Dynomutt and Blue Falcon appear in the &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot; episode &quot;Scooby-Doo, Dog Wonder!&quot;, with Blue Falcon voiced by David Kaye impersonating Gary Owens while Frank Welker once again reprising his role as Dynomutt. Velma Dinkley is shown to be a fan of Blue Falcon.
* Dynomutt and Blue Falcon appeared in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; episode &quot;Heroes and Capes&quot;, with Blue Falcon voiced by Rob Riggle. Blue Falcon pretends to be buff due to inflations in his superhero outfit. Dynomutt does not talk.

====Films====
* Blue Falcon and Dynomutt appear in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; crossover direct-to-DVD movie, &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon&quot;, with Welker reprising his role of Dynomutt once more. The duo was redesigned to be a film-within-a-film with two different iterations of the Blue Falcon. Owen Garrison (voiced by Jeff Bennett) was the star of the original TV series, who became embittered by Hollywood for rebooting his show as a dark and gritty movie with actor Brad Adams (voiced by Diedrich Bader) in the lead role as a technology-based Blue Falcon while Dynomutt was reworked into a destructive robot dog. The film&#x27;s main antagonist, Jack Rabble, used the identity of the Blue Falcon&#x27;s arch-enemy, Mr. Hyde, to commit a daring heist. However, he was foiled by Garrison and Scooby-Doo.
* The Blue Falcon and Dynomutt appeared in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film &quot;Scoob!&quot;, with the Blue Falcon voiced by Mark Wahlberg and Dynomutt voiced by Ken Jeong. They were also joined by assistant Dee Dee Skyes and butler Keith. During the movie&#x27;s credits, it is revealed that the Blue Falcon founded the Falcon Force alongside Atom Ant, Captain Caveman, Jabberjaw, and Grape Ape. In the movie, we learn that Radley, the original Blue Falcon, has retired to Palm Beach, Florida, and his son, Brian, has taken up the mantle of the Blue Falcon. But Brian is struggling in the role. Dynomutt is portrayed in the film as being more mature and far more competent than in the early cartoons as a result of an involuntary upgrade given to him by Brian, resulting in Dynomutt being disdainful and mocking Brian frequently and comparing him poorly to his father. Over time, however, Dynomutt&#x27;s attitude toward Brian improves, and by the end of the film he&#x27;s providing Brian with the encouragement that he needs in order to step out of his father&#x27;s shadow.
* Dynomutt and Blue Falcon&#x27;s iterations from the &quot;Scoob!&quot; film also made cameo appearances in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. They are seen as spectators watching the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad.

====Comics====
* From November 1977 to September 1978, Marvel Comics published a bimonthly &quot;Dynomutt&quot; comic book series that lasted for six issues.
* Ongoing series &quot;Cartoon Network Presents&quot; #21 (May 1999) featured a story starring Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon. It was written by Dan Slott with art by Manny Galan and Mike DeCarlo.
* As part of a series of crossovers featuring DC and Hanna-Barbera characters together, DC launched &quot;Super-Sons/Dynomutt Special&quot; #1 in May 2018. The issue was written by Peter Tomasi with art by Fernando Pasarin.

<doc id="1155086" wikidata="Q462062" url="?curid=1155086" title="Iron John">
<text>&quot;Iron John&quot; (also &quot;Iron Hans&quot;; German: &quot;Der Eisenhans&quot;) is a German fairy tale found in the collections of the Brothers Grimm, tale number 136, about an iron-skinned wild man and a prince. The original German title is &quot;Eisenhans&quot;, a compound of &quot;Eisen&quot; &quot;iron&quot; and &quot;Hans&quot; (like English &quot;John&quot;, a common short form of the personal name Johannes). It represents Aarne–Thompson type 502, &quot;The wild man as a helper&quot;.

Most people see the story as a parable about a boy maturing into adulthood. The story also became the basis for the book &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; by Robert Bly which spawned the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement in the early 1990s. The book spent 62 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Origin==
According to the Brothers Grimm, the source of &quot;Eisern Hans&quot;, in their compilation, was tale nr. 17 from Friedmund von Arnim&#x27;s book.

==Synopsis==

Once upon a time, there was a kingdom that was near a great forest that was filled with all types of wild animals. The King sends a huntsman into the forest nearby to hunt a deer and the huntsman never returns. The King sends more men into the forest where they each meet with the same fate. The King sends all his remaining huntsmen out as a group, but again, none return. The king proclaims the woods as dangerous and off-limits to all.

Some years later, a wandering explorer accompanied by a dog hears of these dangerous woods and asks permission to hunt in the forest, claiming that he might be able to discover the fate of the other hunters. The man and his dog are allowed to enter. As they come to a lake in the middle of the forest, the dog is dragged under water by a giant arm. The hunter returns to the forest the next day with a group of men to empty the lake. They find lying down at the bottom of the lake a large and naked wild man with rusted iron-like skin, long shaggy fur all over his body (some versions show him in some article of clothing), and sporting a shaggy beard and hair that are long enough to go down to his knees. They capture him and he is locked in a cage in the courtyard as a curiosity. The king declares that no one is allowed to set the wild man free or they will face the penalty of death.

Years later, the 8-year-old prince is playing with a ball in the courtyard. He accidentally rolls it into the cage where the iron-skinned man picks it up and will only return it if he is set free. He states further that the only key to the cage is hidden beneath the queen&#x27;s pillow.

Though the prince hesitates, he eventually builds up the courage to sneak into his mother&#x27;s room and steal the key. He releases the wild iron-skinned man who reveals his name to be Iron John (or Iron Hans depending on the translation). The prince fears he will be killed for setting Iron John free, so Iron John agrees to take the prince with him into the forest.

Iron John is a powerful being and has many treasures that he guards. He sets the prince to watch over his well, but warns him not to let anything touch it or fall in because it will turn instantly to gold. The prince obeys at first, but begins to play in the well eventually turning all his hair into gold. Disappointed in the boy&#x27;s failure, Iron John sends him away to experience poverty and struggle. Iron John also tells the prince that if he ever needs anything, simply to call the name of Iron John three times.

The prince travels to a distant land and offers his services to its king. Since he is ashamed of his golden hair, he refuses to remove his cap before its king and is sent to assist the gardener.

When war comes to the kingdom, the prince sees his chance to make a name for himself. He calls upon Iron John, who gives him a horse, armor, and a legion of iron warriors to fight alongside him. The prince successfully defends his new homeland, but returns all that he borrowed to Iron John before returning to his former position.

In celebration, the king announces a banquet and offers his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage to any one of the knights who can catch a golden apple that will be thrown into their midst. The king hopes that the mysterious knight who saved the kingdom will show himself for such a prize. Again the prince asks Iron John for help, and again Iron John disguises the prince as the mysterious knight. Though the prince catches the golden apple and escapes, and does so again on two more occasions, he is eventually found out.

After telling his tale to the court, the prince is returned to his former station, marries the princess, and is happily reunited with his parents. Iron John too comes to the wedding. This time, he is seen without his wild man appearance that made him frightening, as his true form is a stately king. Iron John reveals to the prince he was under an enchantment until he found someone worthy and pure of heart to set him free, and in his gratitude he bequeaths all his treasures to the prince.

==Analysis==
===Tale type===
The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 502, &quot;The Wild Man as Helper&quot;.

The oldest variant to be preserved is the Italian &quot;Guerrino and the Savage Man&quot;. In chivalric romance the motif appears in recognizable if rationalized form in &quot;Roswall and Lillian&quot;. This in turn influenced the ballad &quot;The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward&quot;, too closely related not to be derived.

===Related tales===
A more widespread variant, found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, opens with the prince for some reason being the servant of an evil being, where he gains the same gifts, and the tale proceeds as in this variant; one such tale is &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Horse&quot;. These tales are classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 314, &quot;The Goldener&quot;: a youth with golden hair works as the king&#x27;s gardener. In this regard, Germanist , in &quot;Enzyklopädie des Märchens&quot;, suggested that tale type ATU 502 should be treated as an introductory episode, since both types (ATU 502 and ATU 314) &quot;largely&quot; have the same narrative sequence. Also, he noted that the type was marked by the release of the wild man prisoner by the hero. Similarly, German scholar Hans-Jörg Uther noted that type ATU 502 is &quot;often&quot; the first part to ATU 314, &quot;Goldener&quot;.

Another closely related tale is the former tale type AT 532, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; or &quot;Neznaiko&quot; (a sapient horse instructs the hero to play dumb). The former type happens in Hungarian tale &quot;Nemtutka&quot; and Russian tale &quot;Story of Ivan, the Peasant&#x27;s Son&quot;.

These three tale types (ATU 502, ATU 314 and AaTh 532), which refer to a male protagonist expelled from home, are said to be &quot;widespread in Europe&quot;.

==Variants==
Tale type ATU 502 is known throughout Europe, in such variants as &quot;The Hairy Man&quot;. The tale type is said to be common in Russian and Ukraine, but &quot;disseminated&quot; in Western Europe. The type can also be found in India, Indonesia and Turkey.

===Slavic===
According to Germanist , in &quot;Enzyklopädie des Märchens&quot;, the wild man, in Slavic and Eastern European variants, is described as having iron, copper or gold skin.

The tale type is also reported in the East Slavic Folktale Classification () as type SUS 502, : the prince releases a supernatural prisoner his father captured, and is expelled from home; he reaches another kingdom and, through heroics, gets to marry a princess. In addition, according to Jack V. Haney, the story is &quot;known&quot; in Russia since 1786, via printed books, and the supernatural captive is either a bogatyr or a forest spirit.

==== Germany ====
According to Jack Zipes, another literary predecessor to the Grimm&#x27;s tale in German tradition is Christian August Vulpius&#x27;s &quot;Der eiserne Mann, oder: Der Lohn der Gehorsams&quot; (&quot;The Iron Man, or, The Reward of Obedience&quot;).

Germanist collected another German variant, from Gutenberg, titled &quot;Der eiserne Mann&quot; (&quot;The Iron Man&quot;).

Folklorist Franz Xaver von Schönwerth collected in the 19th century a Bavarian variant titled &quot;König Goldhaar&quot; (&quot;King Goldenlocks&quot;). In this tale, a king has a golden-haired son. One day, the king captures a wild man who is made of iron and brings it home in a cage. The young prince accidentally tosses his ball inside the cage, which the wild man promises to return if the boy releases him. The prince fulfills his promise, to the king&#x27;s anger, who orders his son execution. However, the king&#x27;s servants spare the boy and bring the king a poor shepherd&#x27;s little finger as proof of his deed. The prince changes clothes with the shepherd and wanders off to another kingdom, where he finds work as the royal gardener&#x27;s assistant. The prince, in his work as a gardener, arranges bouquets for the princesses, and ties a strand of his golden hair to the youngest&#x27;s. Some time later, the king announces that he shall marry his elder daughter to the one who she gives her bouquet of flowers. The elder marries a prince, and so does the middle one. As for the youngest, she withholds hers until the gardener&#x27;s assistant passes by her. She then gives the youth her bouquet, they marry and she moves out to his hut. Later, the king falls ill, and only the apples of Paradise can cure him. The gardener&#x27;s assistant goes to the woods and meets the wild man again, who gives King Goldenlocks a club and orders him to strike a rock: a passage to a lush garden opens for King Goldenlocks to fetch the apples and rush out of the garden. It happens thus, and King Goldenlocks, the apples in his pocket, goes to a tavern and meets his brothers-in-law, who do not recognize him. King Goldenlocks agrees to let them have the apples, as long as they agree to be marked on their backs with the gallows. Next, the king is still sick, and needs snake&#x27;s milk. King Goldenlocks follows the wild man&#x27;s instructions again and gets the snake&#x27;s milk; he then goes to meet his brothers-in-law again, who take the snake&#x27;s milk in exchange for marking their backs again. Lastly, war breaks out, and the king sends his sons-in-law to protect the kingdom. King Goldenlocks meets the wild man again, who furnishes him with armour, weapons and a horse for him to join the battle. After three campaigns, King Goldenlocks, as a mysterious knights, receives an injury in his feet, which the king, his father-in-law, dresses with a handkerchief. Back to the castle, the king summons everyone for a banquet, and goes to the gardener&#x27;s assistant hut to invite him in person. Once there, he sees his injured foot, and realizes the gardener&#x27;s assistant was the knight at the battlefield. The tale was classified as both type ATU 502, &quot;The Wild Man as a Helper&quot;, and ATU 314, &quot;Goldener&quot;.

==== Austria ====
Author collected a tale from an Upper Austrian source with the title &quot;Der Pechkappenhans&quot; (&quot;The Pitch-Cap Hans&quot;): a prince or count has a young son, who plays with his toy gun in the garden. One day, his father orders his soldiers to capture a mysterious animal that appeared in his garden. He does and places him in a cage in the garden. Some time later, he is playing with his toy gun and shoots it inside the cage. The animal makes an offer: he will return the toy bullet if the boy releases him. The boy agrees and lets him loose. The boy&#x27;s father learns of this and orders him son to be killed for this affront. His guests try to dissuade him, but a valet takes the boy to the woods to fulfill his lord&#x27;s orders. In the woods, an old man appears to the pair, and says he will save the boy&#x27;s life, just as th boy saved his (for he was the animal in the cage). He kills a crocodile, takes its tongue and gives it to the valet, while he takes the boy with him to a hut in the forest. The boy and the old man live together, and the man warns him to not lift a certain lid. One day, while the old man is away, the boy opens up the lid and finds a golden liquid, into which he dips his finger into and tries to clean it in his hair, gilding it. The old man returns and, seeing the boy&#x27;s golden hair colour, realizes he disobeyed his orders. Reluctantly, he expels the boy to the wide world, but gives him a pitch-cap hat to cover his hair, and says he has but to whistle and the old man will come to his aid. The boy wanders off in the world until he reaches another kingdom, where he takes up a job as a shepherd first, then as assistant to the king&#x27;s gardener. The boy, who is eventually called &quot;Pechkappen Hansl&quot;, summons the old man, who gives him a horse to trample the garden. Later, one of the king&#x27;s daughters takes an interest in the lowly gardener, and, in a suitor selection test, throws him a golden apple, signifying her choice of husband. After they marry, the princess moves out to the gardener&#x27;s hut in the palace. Some time later, war breaks out, and the king gives his son-in-law a lame horse. As pitch-cap Hans hides himself, he summons the old man who provides him with another horse, so he can fight to defend his father-in-law&#x27;s kingdom.

==Adaptations==
* A literary version exists with the name &quot;The Forest Man&quot;, where the Wild Man-like character is named &quot;Forest Man&quot;.
* Iron John was featured in &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics&quot; under its Iron Hans alias with Iron Hans voiced by Richard Epcar in the English dub and the other kingdom&#x27;s king voiced by Michael Forest in the English dub. At one point during the English dub, the prince&#x27;s mother the queen called him a giant. In this version, Iron Hans is dressed like a barbarian and put up a fight after emerging from his pond before being subdued, the king of the kingdom that the prince was from is dead, and Iron Hans sends the prince on his way when he let a leaf fall on his lake and the reflection showed that the prince had a fish-like face. The prince does various work for people before becoming a gardener for the local king. After the prince enlists Iron Hans&#x27; help to make an army to protect that kingdom, the prince is granted the princess as his bride and he thanks Iron Hans in his mind. A vision of Iron Hans appears in the sky congratulating the prince for becoming a worthy prince.
* The story is featured as an episode of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Grimm&quot;, in which the tale is twisted into a Terminator-like setting.
* An episode from the fourth season of &quot;Grimm&quot; titled &quot;Iron Hans&quot; is loosely based on the story, and the episode &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;, from the first season, uses a line from it as an opening quote.
* The Iron John tale appears in Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Sings The Blues&quot; (1994) as an allegory for children coming of age.
* Anne Sexton wrote an adaptation as a poem called &quot;Iron Hans&quot; in her collection &quot;Transformations&quot; (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy tales&quot;.
* Alphaville&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Iron John&quot; starts with a sketchy retelling of the first half of the story. The rest is about an opportunistic career in an unspecified profession in a more modern setting.
* Iron John appears in the 2015 American superhero film &quot;Avengers Grimm&quot;, portrayed by Lou Ferrigno.

==Legacy==
In 1991, Robert Bly analyzed the story in &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot;. Bly&#x27;s reading analyzes the story for lessons about masculinity applicable to 20th-century men, and became a major work of the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement.

Tarbell was appointed midshipman on board of USS &quot;Constitution&quot; in the United States Navy on 5 December 1798. Tarbel became an officer in the rank of lieutenant on 25 August 1800.

=== First Barbary War ===
He served in &quot;Constitution&quot; and other ships of the Mediterranean Squadron from 1800 to 1804, at the height of America&#x27;s war with Tripoli. Under Commodore Edward Preble&#x27;s command, he took part in the 1804 blockade of Tripoli and was among those honored by Congress for services rendered during that action.

=== Between the wars ===
On 3 March 1805 Tarbell was promoted to master commandant. In 1808, he married Elizabeth Ann Cassin, who was Commodore John Cassin&#x27;s daughter and Stephen Cassin&#x27;s sister.

After the war, in 1806, Tarbell was appointed master of the Washington Naval Yard. In 1811-1812 (maybe even until 1813), he was commanding the controversial repair of USS &quot;John Adams&quot;.

=== War of 1812 ===
In 1813, Tarbell temporarily was appointed to command USS &quot;Constellation&quot;. He also was the commanding officer of the Gosport gunboat flotilla.

From 19 to 23 June 1813 Tarbell commanded a boat expedition against the British squadron off Craney Island and in the James River. On the 20th his flotilla of fifteen gunboats had a 45-minute engagement with the British frigate &quot;Junon&quot;. The other British frigates joined the engagement forcing the American gunboats to retire. The British and American accounts of this particular engagement differ greatly. On 22 June 1813, Tarbell commanded USS &quot;Constellation&quot; in the battle of Craney Island, which was won by the Americans. He was commended by his superior, Commodore Stephen Cassin, and by the army officers ashore (Lt Col Henry Beatty) for his gallantry and assistance in the defense of Craney Island. On 23 July 1813, James Madison nominated Tarbell for the rank of captain effective 24 July 1813.

== Death and legacy ==
Captain Tarbell died at Norfolk or Washington D.C., on 24 November 1815 and is buried at the Catholic burying ground of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church.

USS &quot;Tarbell&quot; (DD-142) was named for him.

<text>&quot;Female of the Species&quot; is a song by English rock band Space, released as their fourth single and second single proper from their debut album, &quot;Spiders&quot; (1996), on 27 May 1996. The song reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in October 2019. It became the band&#x27;s only charting single in both the United States and Canada.

==About the song==

Written and sung by frontman Tommy Scott in tribute to his late father, who reportedly disliked his son&#x27;s taste of music, &quot;Female of the Species&quot; is a funky, upbeat, Latin-flavoured number with feel-good-sounding vibes and vocals, reminiscent of lounge singers such as Perry Como and Frank Sinatra, combined with keyboardist Franny Griffiths&#x27; trademark sound effects and Scott&#x27;s darkly humorous lyrics. The song borrows to some extent, both thematically and in overall aesthetic, from the Walker Brothers&#x27; theme song for the 1967 film &quot;Deadlier Than the Male&quot;. When the song was performed at later concerts, Scott usually walked into the audience to shake them by the hand.

The song&#x27;s distinctive style and lyrics led to it being used in TV and film. It was the theme song to the UK drama &quot;Cold Feet&quot; and appeared in the 1997 film &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; starring Janeane Garofalo, as well as during the end credits of the popular movie &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (in the so-called &#x27;Fembot Mix&#x27;, available on the Original Soundtrack), and in the &quot;Daria&quot; episode &quot;College Bored&quot;. It gained further popularity in the UK when used in a 1998 advert (with a cameo appearance by Quentin Crisp) for the body spray &quot;Impulse&quot;.

The song&#x27;s name is a reference to the 1911 Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;The Female of the Species&quot;, which has as its refrain: &quot;The female of the species is more deadly than the male.&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;Female of the Species&quot; debuted at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart on 2 June 1996 and reached its peak of number 14 the following week. On 11 October 2019, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) awarded the song a silver certification for sales and streams of over 200,000 units. It became the band&#x27;s only entry on any music chart in the United States and Canada, peaking at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, number four on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 chart, and number 68 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart. In Australia, &quot;Female of the Species&quot; entered the ARIA Singles Chart on 11 May 1997, peaking at number 80 in June.

<doc id="1155117" wikidata="Q4010518" url="?curid=1155117" title="Darboux vector">
<text>In differential geometry, especially the theory of space curves, the Darboux vector is the angular velocity vector of the Frenet frame of a space curve. It is named after Gaston Darboux who discovered it. It is also called angular momentum vector, because it is directly proportional to angular momentum.

In terms of the Frenet-Serret apparatus, the Darboux vector ω can be expressed as
:formula_1
and it has the following symmetrical properties:
:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4
which can be derived from Equation (1) by means of the Frenet-Serret theorem (or vice versa).

Let a rigid object move along a regular curve described parametrically by β(&quot;t&quot;). This object has its own intrinsic coordinate system. As the object moves along the curve, let its intrinsic coordinate system keep itself aligned with the curve&#x27;s Frenet frame. As it does so, the object&#x27;s motion will be described by two vectors: a translation vector, and a rotation vector ω, which is an areal velocity vector: the Darboux vector.

Note that this rotation is kinematic, rather than physical, because usually when a rigid object moves freely in space its rotation is independent of its translation. The exception would be if the object&#x27;s rotation is physically constrained to align itself with the object&#x27;s translation, as is the case with the cart of a roller coaster.

Consider the rigid object moving smoothly along the regular curve. Once the translation is &quot;factored out&quot;, the object is seen to rotate the same way as its Frenet frame. The total rotation of the Frenet frame is the combination of the rotations of each of the three Frenet vectors:
:formula_5

Each Frenet vector moves about an &quot;origin&quot; which is the centre of the rigid object (pick some point within the object and call it its centre). The areal velocity of the tangent vector is:
:formula_6

::formula_7

Likewise,
:formula_8

:formula_9

Now apply the Frenet-Serret theorem to find the areal velocity components:
:formula_10

:formula_11

:formula_12
so that 

:formula_13
as claimed.

The Darboux vector provides a concise way of interpreting curvature &quot;κ&quot; and torsion &quot;τ&quot; geometrically: curvature is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the binormal unit vector, whereas torsion is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the tangent unit vector.

<text>The Government of Amsterdam consists of several territorial and functional forms of local and regional government. The principal form of government is the municipality of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The municipality&#x27;s territory covers the city of Amsterdam as well as a number of small towns. The city of Amsterdam is also part of several functional forms of regional government. These include the Waterschap (&quot;water board&quot;) of Amstel, Gooi en Vecht, which is responsible for water management, and the &quot;Stadsregio&quot; (City Region) of Amsterdam, which has responsibilities in the areas of spatial planning and public transport.

The municipality of Amsterdam borders the municipalities of Diemen, De Ronde Venen, Ouder-Amstel, Amstelveen, Stichtse Vecht, Wijdemeren and Hilversum in the south, Haarlemmermeer in the west, and Zaanstad, Oostzaan, Landsmeer and Waterland in the north.

Weesp has been an urban area of the municipality of Amsterdam since 24 March 2022.

==Municipal government==
The city of Amsterdam is a municipality under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a municipal council (&quot;gemeenteraad&quot;, also known as &#x27;city council&#x27;, the principal legislative authority), a municipal executive board (&quot;college van burgemeester en wethouders&quot;), and a mayor (&quot;burgemeester&quot;). The mayor is both a member of the municipal executive board and an individual authority with a number of statutory responsibilities, mainly in the area of maintaining public order. The municipal council has 45 seats. Its members are elected for a four-year term through citywide elections on the basis of proportional representation. Under the Municipalities Act, the mayor is appointed for a six-year term by the national government upon nomination by the municipal council. The other members of the executive board (&quot;wethouders&quot;, or &#x27;alderpersons&#x27;) are appointed directly by the municipal council, but may be dismissed at any time after a no-confidence vote in the council. Because of this parliamentary system, the alderpersons are not appointed until a governing majority in the council has reached a coalition agreement following council elections.

In July 2010, Eberhard van der Laan (Labour Party) was appointed mayor of Amsterdam by the national government for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam municipal council. After the 2014 municipal council elections, a governing majority of D66, VVD and SP was formed - the first coalition without the Labour Party since World War II. Next to the mayor, the municipal executive board consists of eight &quot;wethouders&quot; (&#x27;alderpersons&#x27;) appointed by the municipal council: four D66 alderpersons, two VVD alderpersons and two SP alderpersons.

===Municipal Government 2006–2010===
After the 2006 municipal elections a coalition was formed between PvdA and GroenLinks, with a majority of 27 out of 45. These elections saw a political landslide throughout the country, with a strong shift to the left, of which Amsterdam was a prime example. The much talked about all-left-wing coalition of PvdA, GroenLinks and SP that polls indicate would become possible after the national elections of 2006 and that was such a political success in Nijmegen had its largest majority in Amsterdam, apart from some small towns. PvdA even needed only three more seats to form a coalition and could thus take its pick, which forced potential coalition partners to give in on a lot of issues. In the case of GroenLinks, this was mostly the policy of preventive searching by the police, which they were opposed to but had to allow.

In total, 24 parties took part in the elections, including 11 new ones, but only 7 got seats.

===Municipal Government 2022–present===

== Mayors ==

The mayor of Amsterdam is the head of the city council. The current mayor is Femke Halsema. The mayors since World War II are:
* (1945–1946)
* Arnold Jan d&#x27;Ailly (1946–1956)
* Gijs van Hall (1956–1967)
* Ivo Samkalden (1967–1977)
* Wim Polak (1977–1983)
* Ed van Thijn (1983–1994)

* Job Cohen (2001–2010)
* Eberhard van der Laan (2010–2017)
* Femke Halsema (2018–)

== Boroughs &amp; urban area ==

Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into 7 boroughs (&quot;stadsdelen&quot; or &#x27;districts&#x27;) and 1 urban area (&quot;stadsgebied&quot;) Weesp. This system was implemented in the 1980s and significantly reformed in 2014. Before 2014, the boroughs were responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. The idea was to bring the government closer to the people. All of these had their own district council (&quot;deelraad&quot;), chosen by a popular election. Local decisions were made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining the whole city (like major infrastructural projects), were delegated to the central city council. As of 2014, the powers of the boroughs have been significantly reduced, although they still have an elected council called &quot;bestuurscommissie&quot; (&#x27;district committee&#x27;). 

On 24 March 2022, the city of Weesp merged with Amsterdam. Thus Weesp became an urban area of the municipality of Amsterdam. Westpoort covers the western harbour area of Amsterdam. This is not a borough, because it has very few inhabitants and it is governed directly by the central municipal council.

<text>USS &quot;Niagara&quot; (APA-87) was a &quot;Gilliam&quot;-class attack transport that served with the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1950.

==History==
&quot;Niagara&quot; was named after Fort Niagara, a fort captured from the British by American forces 28 November 1812; she was the eighth US Navy ship to bear the name. She was laid down 20 November 1944 under Maritime Commission contract by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California; launched 10 February 1945; acquired by the Navy 26 March 1945; and commissioned at San Pedro, California, 29 March 1945.

===World War II===
Following amphibious warfare training out of San Diego, &quot;Niagara&quot; sailed 26 May 1945 with cargo and 887 Marines, whom she landed at Pearl Harbor 1 June. In the following weeks she transported troops, cargo, ammunition, and mail between the various Hawaiian Islands.

She stood out of Pearl Harbor 1 July bound, via the Marshalls and Carolines, for Okinawa, arriving Buckner Bay 5 August. After debarking 903 Army troops and their combat support weapons and cargo, she departed 8 August with 40 officers and 771 men of the 81st Naval Construction Battalion for debarking at Guam in the Marianas. She arrived Apra Harbor on the morning of 15 August, the day of Japan&#x27;s capitulation.

===After hostilities===
&quot;Niagara&quot; transported Navy passengers from Guam to the Philippines, arriving San Pedro Bay 20 August. She then set course for Cebu to embark the Army&#x27;s 164th Regimental Combat Team, sailed 1 September, arrived Yokohama the 8th, and landed her occupation troops. She again headed for the Philippines 16 September to embark men of the Army&#x27;s 305th Infantry, 77th Division, landed at Otaru, Hokkaidō, Japan, 5 October. From there, she carried men of the Navy&#x27;s 128th Construction Battalion to Apra Harbor.

She stood out from Apra Harbor 22 October with an Army signal battalion bound for China. The attack transport reached Tientsin 29 October and sailed 10 November for the Marianas. Joining Operation Magic Carpet, the massive operation to return demobilizing servicemen, she embarked Army troops in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, Marianas; sailed the 20th; and reached San Francisco 4 December.

===Operation Crossroads===
&quot;Niagara&quot; departed San Francisco 20 December for Samar, Philippine Islands, arriving 10 January 1946. While there, she received word that she would participate in the atomic bomb tests of Operation Crossroads as a unit of Joint Task Force 1. She put to sea 3 February to prepare at Pearl Harbor, then sailed to Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls, the location of the tests, arriving 31 May.

A target ship, &quot;Niagara&quot; survived the atomic explosions of 1 and 25 July. She departed Bikini 21 August for and towed the battleship USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) to Kwajalein for tests, and Pearl Harbor en route to San Francisco, arriving 16 September.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Niagara&quot; remained on the west coast until she departed San Diego 7 November, steaming via the Panama Canal to Hampton Roads, Virginia. She arrived Norfolk, Virginia on 2 December and decommissioned there 12 December 1946.

After serving to test the effects of special conventional explosives in the Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Niagara&quot; was sold for scrapping on 5 February 1950 to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1155124" wikidata="Q1743545" url="?curid=1155124" title="Cardston">
<text>Cardston is a town in Alberta, Canada. It was first settled in 1887 by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who travelled from Utah, via the Macleod-Benton Trail, to present-day Alberta in one of the century&#x27;s last wagon migrations. The founder of the town was Charles Ora Card. The combined church and school was completed by January 29 the year following their arrival.

==History==
Cardston was &quot;dry&quot; (alcohol free) for more than a century after the 1915 Alberta liquor plebiscite. In 2023, following a municipal plebiscite in which residents voted narrowly in favour of the measure, the town council voted 5-2 to allow alcohol to be served in restaurants and recreation facilities such as the local golf course. Liquor stores, lounges, nightclubs and other alcohol-primary businesses remain prohibited, and there are no licensed premises in which to use video lottery terminals.

In 1951, 75% of Cardston&#x27;s 3500 residents were members of the LDS Church. It remains at about 80%, as of 2014.

On August 15, 2019, the town was granted a coat of arms by the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

== Geography ==
Cardston is situated in the foothills of southwest Alberta, approximately north from the American state of Montana. On its north side, it borders the Kainai Nation (Blood Tribe) Reserve, one of the largest reserves in North America. to the west of Cardston are the Rocky Mountains of Waterton Lakes National Park. Cardston is southwest of Lethbridge and south of Calgary.

=== Climate ===

Cardston experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). Along with the rest of southern Alberta, Cardston is subject to chinooks, which often bring temperatures in mid-winter well above . This same pattern results in more than 200 days of wind a year.

St. Mary&#x27;s Dam reservoir northeast of Cardston supports water sports in the summer months.

The Cardston Alberta Temple was constructed by Latter-day Saint pioneers from 1913-1923, and was the first temple constructed by the Church outside of the United States. It remained the only temple in Canada until the Toronto Ontario Temple was built in 1990.

The Remington Carriage Museum is the largest collection of horse-drawn vehicles in North America, with more than 250 carriages, wagons and sleighs. The facility features video displays, a fire hall, carriage factory, restoration shop, working stable, carriage rides, carriage rentals, a restaurant, guided tours, and a gift shop.

The Carriage House Theatre was constructed in 1912, and underwent renovations in 1937 and 1992. It seats 350 and hosts films, community theatre and professional summer theatre.

Schools include the Cardston High School, the Cardston Jr. High School (formerly Eastridge Elementary School), and Cardston Elementary School which are all under the Westwind School Division.

Former schools include Leeside (grades 1 and 2 - torn down in the late 1980s to make way for the Remington-Alberta Carriage Centre) and Westside. The building that housed many of the junior high facilities, E.J. Wood School (including the gymnasium near the current high school), Parkland School, and John S. Smith Schools were torn down in 1993 as the junior high moved to the former Eastridge building. The Cardston High School underwent extensive renovations in the early 2000s, including an expansion to its gymnasium, much-improved fitness and weight room facilities, wider hallways, and a new cafeteria.

The &quot;Cardston News&quot; was first published in 1924, and was a weekly until 1925. During 1924–1925, the newspaper was edited and published by Fred Burton. It was later taken over by D.O. Wight, editor and managing director from September 17, 1925 until June 9, 1936. Fred Burton took over as publisher on June 16, 1936. The &quot;Cardston News&quot; was taken over by Gordon F. West On May 7, 1964. The &quot;Cardston Record&quot; began publication on August 6, 1898, and was published weekly until September 1901.

<doc id="1155130" wikidata="Q852921" url="?curid=1155130" title="Reginald Horace Blyth">
<text>Reginald Horace Blyth (3 December 1898 – 28 October 1964) was an English writer and devotee of Japanese culture. He is most famous for his writings on Zen and on haiku poetry.

==Early life==
Blyth was born in Essex, England, the son of a railway clerk. He was the only child of Horace and Henrietta Blyth. He attended Cleveland Road Primary School, in Ilford, then the County High School (later Ilford County High School). In 1916, at the height of World War I, he was imprisoned at Wormwood Scrubs, as a conscientious objector, before working on the Home Office Scheme at Princetown Work Centre in the former and future Dartmoor Prison. After the war he attended the University of London, where he read English and from which he graduated in 1923, with honours.

He adopted a vegetarian lifestyle which he maintained throughout his life. Blyth played the flute, made musical instruments, and taught himself several European languages. He was particularly fond of the music of J.S. Bach. In 1924, he received a teaching certificate from London Day Training College. The same year, he married Anna Bercovitch, a university friend. Some accounts say they moved to India, where he taught for a while until he became unhappy with British colonial rule, but most scholars dismiss this episode, claiming it to have been invented or misunderstood by Blyth&#x27;s mentor Daisetz T. Suzuki.

==Korea (1925–1935)==
In 1925, the Blyths moved to Korea (then under Japanese rule), where Blyth became assistant professor of English at Keijō Imperial University in Keijō (now Seoul). While in Korea, Blyth began to learn Japanese and Chinese, and studied Zen under the master Hanayama Taigi of Myōshin-ji Keijo Betsuin (Seoul). In Korea he started to read D. T. Suzuki&#x27;s books about Zen. In 1933, he informally adopted a Korean student, paying for his studies in Korea and later at London University. His wife parted from him in 1934 and Blyth took one-year absence from the university in 1935, following her to England. After the divorce, Blyth returned to Korea in early 1936, leaving the adopted son with his ex-wife. The adopted son returned after World War II to Korea. In 1947 he was captured by North Korean soldiers; when he returned to the South, he was shot as a traitor by the South Korean army.

==Japan (1936–1964)==
Having returned to Seoul in 1936, Blyth remarried in 1937, to a Japanese woman named Kijima Tomiko, with whom he had two daughters. In 1940 they moved to Kanazawa, Japan, which was D. T. Suzuki&#x27;s home town, and Blyth took a job as an English teacher at the Fourth Higher School (later Kanazawa University).

When Britain declared war on Japan in December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Blyth was interned as a British enemy alien. Although he expressed his sympathy for Japan and sought Japanese nationality, this was denied. During his internment, his extensive library was destroyed in an air raid. In the internment camp in Kobe he finished his first book &quot;Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics&quot; and wrote parts of his books about haiku and senryu. He also met in the camp Robert Aitken, later Roshi of the Diamond Sangha in Honolulu.

After the war, Blyth worked diligently with the authorities, both Japanese and American, to ease the transition to peace. Blyth functioned as to the Japanese Imperial Household, and his close friend, Harold Gould Henderson, was on General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff. Together, they helped draft the declaration , by which Emperor Hirohito declared himself to be a human being, and not divine.

By 1946, Blyth had become Professor of English at Gakushuin University, and became private tutor to the Crown Prince (later emperor) Akihito until the end of his [Blyth&#x27;s] life. He did much to popularise Zen philosophy and Japanese poetry (particularly haiku) in the West. In 1954, he was awarded a doctorate in literature from Tokyo University, and, in 1959, he received the (Order of Merit) Fourth Grade.

Blyth died in 1964, probably of a brain tumour and complications from pneumonia, in the Seiroka Hospital in Tokyo. He was buried in the cemetery of the Shokozan Tokei Soji Zenji Temple in Kamakura, next to his old friend, D. T. Suzuki. Blyth&#x27;s posthumous Buddhist name is Bulaisu Kodo Shoshin Koju.
== Works ==
Blyth produced a series of work on Zen, haiku and , and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature.

He wrote six books on haiku (1949–52, 1963–64) and two books on (1949, 1960), four books on humour in Asian and English literature (1957, 1959(a), 1959(b), 1961), as well as seven books on Zen (1942, 1952, 1960–64; posthumous 1966, 1970). Further publications include studies of English literature (1942, 1957, 1959(b)) and a three-fifths shortened version of &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; by his favourite author Henry David Thoreau, along with an introduction and explanatory notes.

The most significant of his publications was his four-volume Haiku series (1949–52), his &quot;Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics&quot; and his five-volume Zen series.

Nearly all of his books were published in Japan, by Hokuseido Press, Tokyo.

== Work: Zen ==
The actual 5-volume &quot;Zen and Zen Classics&quot; series is a modification by the publishers, caused by the unexpected death of Blyth, of the originally planned 8-volume project, which included a translation of the (Piyenchi), a History of Korean Zen and of Japanese Zen (Dogen, Hakuin etc.) and a renewed edition of his &#x27;Buddhist Sermons on Christian Texts&#x27; as volume 8; (as a result of the modification the already published volume 7 was reprinted as volume 5).

According to D.T. Suzuki, the Zen series should have been &quot;the most complete work on Zen to be presented so far to the English-reading public&quot;.

The first volume presents a general introduction from the Upanishads to Huineng. Volume two and three presents a history of Zen from the Seigen Branch to Nangaku Branch, and volume five contains 25 essays on Zen. In volume four, Blyth translates the (Wumenkuan). Blyth&#x27;s was the third complete translation into English, but the first one which was accompanied by extensive interpretive commentaries on each case.

Blyth&#x27;s early publication &quot;Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics&quot;, published 1942 when he was interned in Japan during World War II, and his Zen and Zen Classics series exerted a significant influence on the Western writers and Zen community, although nearly all of his books were published solely in Japan.

==Work: Haiku and ==
In an autobiographical note, Blyth writes: &quot;By a fortunate chance I then came across haiku, or to speak more exactly , the Way of Haiku, which is the purely poetical (non-emotional, non-intellectual, non-moral, non-aesthetic) life in relation to nature. Next, the biggest bit of luck of all, Zen, through the books of Suzuki Daisetz ... Last but not least there appeared , which might well be dignified by the term , the Way of , for it is an understanding of all things by laughing and smiling at them, and this means forgiving all things, ourselves and God included&quot;. Blyth wrote six books on haiku and two books on , the satirical genre sister of haiku: &quot;In haiku things speak for themselves with the voice of a man, in things do not speak; we speak and speak for ourselves&quot;. Blythe wrote that in the world is &#x27;not seen as God made it&#x27; but &#x27;as man sees it&#x27;; &#x27;to haiku, sex hardly exists; to , it is all pervading ... a great many deal with the subject of the Yoshiwara...&#x27;

After early imagist interest in haiku the genre drew less attention in English, until after World War II, with the appearance of a number of influential volumes about Japanese haiku.

In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of &quot;Haiku&quot;, Blyth&#x27;s four-volume work, haiku was introduced to the post-war Western world. His &quot;Haiku&quot; series (1949–52) was dealing mostly with pre-modern haiku, though included Masaoka Shiki; later followed his two-volume &quot;History of Haiku&quot; (1963–64). Today he is best known as a major interpreter of haiku and to English speakers.

Many contemporary Western writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his Zen-based haiku explanations. These include the San Francisco and Beat Generation writers, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as J. D. Salinger (&quot;...particularly haiku, but , too...can be read with special satisfaction when R. H. Blyth was on them. Blyth is sometimes perilous, naturally, since he&#x27;s a highhanded old poem himself, but he&#x27;s also sublime&quot;), Octavio Paz, and E. E. Cummings. Many members of the international &quot;haiku community&quot; also got their first views of haiku from Blyth&#x27;s books, including American author James W. Hackett (born 1929), Eric Amann, William J. Higginson, Anita Virgil, Jane Reichhold, and Lee Gurga. The French philosopher and semiotician Roland Barthes read 1967 Blyth&#x27;s four-volume set, using it for lectures and seminars on haiku 1979.

Some noted Blyth&#x27;s distaste for haiku on more modern themes, some his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen, a connection largely ignored by modern Japanese poets. Bashō, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realising enlightenment; and classic Japanese haiku poets like Chiyo-ni, Buson, and Issa were Pure Land (Jodo) rather than Zen Buddhists. Some also noted that Blyth did not view haiku by Japanese women favourably, that he downplayed their contribution to the genre, especially during the Bashō era. In the chapter &#x27;Women Haiku Writers&#x27; Blyth writes: &quot;Haiku for women, like Zen for women, - this subject makes us once more think about what haiku are, and a woman is…Women are said to be intuitive, and as they cannot think, we may hope this is so, but intuition…is not enough… [it] is doubtfull... whether women can write haiku&quot;.

Although Blyth did not foresee the appearance of original haiku in languages other than Japanese when he began writing on the topic, and although he founded no school of verse, his works stimulated the writing of haiku in English. At the end of the second volume of his &quot;History of Haiku&quot;, he remarked 1964 that &quot;The latest development in the history of haiku is one which nobody foresaw... the writing of haiku outside Japan, not in the Japanese language.&quot;

<doc id="1155141" wikidata="Q971119" url="?curid=1155141" title="Use of force">
<text>The use of force, in the context of law enforcement, may be defined as, &quot;the amount of effort required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling subject.&quot; Multiple definitions exist according to context and purpose. In practical terms, use of force amounts to any combination of threatened or actual force used for a lawful purpose, e.g. to effect arrest; defend oneself or another person; or to interrupt a crime in progress or prevent an imminent crime. Depending on the jurisdiction, legal rights of this nature might be recognized to varying degrees for both police officers and non-sworn individuals; and may be accessible regardless of citizenship. Canada&#x27;s Criminal Code, for example, provides in section 494 for arrest in certain circumstances by &quot;any one.&quot;

Use of force doctrines can be employed by law enforcement officers and military personnel, who are on guard duty. The aim of such doctrines is to balance the needs of security with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects. Injuries to civilians tend to focus attention on self-defense as a justification and in the event of death, the notion of justifiable homicide.

For the English law on the use of force in crime prevention, see Self-defence in English law. The Australian position on the use of troops for civil policing is set out by Michael Head in &quot;Calling Out the Troops: Disturbing Trends and Unanswered Questions&quot;; compare &quot;Use of Deadly Force by the South African Police Services Re-visited&quot; by Malebo Keebine-Sibanda and Omphemetse Sibanda.

==History==

Use of force dates back to the beginning of established law enforcement, with a fear that officers would abuse their power. Currently in society, this fear still exists and one of the ways to fix this problem, is to require police to wear body cameras, which should be turned on during all interactions with civilians.

==Use of force continuum==
The use of force may be standardized by a Use of Force Continuum, which presents guidelines as to the degree of force appropriate in a given situation. One source identifies five very generalized steps, increasing from least use of force to greatest. This kind of continuum generally has many levels, and officers are instructed to respond with a level of force appropriate to the situation at hand, acknowledging that the officer may move from one part of the continuum to another in a matter of seconds.

==U.S. case law==

===&quot;Graham v. Connor&quot; (1989)===
On November 12, 1984, Graham, who was a diabetic, felt an insulin reaction coming on and rushed to the store with a friend to get some orange juice. When the store was too crowded, he and his friend went to another friend&#x27;s house. In the midst of all this, he was being watched by Officer Connor, of the Charlotte City Police Department police department. While on their way to the friend&#x27;s house, the officer stopped the two of them and called for backup. After several other officers arrived, one of them handcuffed Graham. Eventually, when Connor learned that nothing had happened in the convenience store, the officers drove Graham home and released him. Over the course of the encounter, Graham sustained a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, a bruised forehead and an injured shoulder. In the resulting case, &quot;Graham v. Connor&quot; (1989), the Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Connor acted in good faith, because the use of force must be judged based on its objective reasonableness. In determining the &quot;objective reasonableness&quot; of force, the court set out a series of three factors: &quot;the severity of the crime,&quot; &quot;whether there is an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others,&quot; and &quot;whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or evading&quot;.

===&quot;Tennessee v. Garner&quot; (1985)===
On October 3, 1974, Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright of the Memphis Police Department were called to respond to a possible burglary. When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out &quot;police, halt&quot;, and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being &quot;reasonably sure&quot; that Garner was unarmed. The Supreme Court held, in &quot;Tennessee v. Garner&quot;, that deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others.

=== &quot;Payne v. Pauley&quot; (2003) ===
Payne v. Pauley is a case in the Seventh Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the use of force must be both reasonable and actually necessary to avoid an excessive force complaint.

===&quot;Nelson v. City of Davis&quot; (2004)===
On April 16, 2004, what was supposed to be known as the &quot;biggest party in history&quot; took place at the annual UC Davis picnic. Due to the large number of participants at this party, people began to illegally park their cars. Sgt. John Wilson demanded that officers start to issue parking tickets to the illegally parked cars. Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non-residents to leave the complex. Thirty or forty officers were rounded up with riot gear – including pepper ball guns – to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions were given by the police. Officers began to fire pepper-balls, one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson. The Ninth Circuit held that the use of force was unreasonable and the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity.

=== &quot;Plumhoff v. Rickard&quot; (2014) ===
On July 18, 2014, a West Memphis police officer stopped Donald Rickard for a broken headlight. As the officer talked with Rickard he noticed that there was an indentation in the windshield and that Rickard was acting very erratic. The officer asked Rickard to step out of the vehicle. Rickard at that point fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued, which involved several other officers. Rickard lost control of his vehicle in a parking lot, and officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard. Rickard again tried to flee, hitting several police cruisers and nearly hitting several officers. At this time officers opened fire on Rickard. The officers fired a total of 15 rounds which resulted in the death of both Rickard and his passenger. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of force was justified, because the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force must be based on the situation in which it was used, and not on hindsight.

=== &quot;Kisela v. Hughes&quot; (2018) ===
Andrew Kisela, a Tucson police officer, shot Hughes less than a minute after arriving with other police officers to a report of a woman erratically hacking a tree with a knife. Hughes was in possession of a large kitchen knife, had taken steps towards her roommate, and had refused to drop the knife when repeatedly told to do so. After the shooting, the officers discovered that Hughes had a history of mental illness. All officers stated later that they believed Hughes to be a threat to the roommate. Hughes sued the officer claiming &quot;excessive use of force&quot; in violation of the 4th amendment. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Officer Kisela, and stated that a reasonable officer is not required to foresee judicial decisions &quot;that do not yet exist in instances where the requirements of the Fourth Amendment are far from obvious&quot;.

== U.S. statistics ==
Of the 40 million people in the United States who had face to face contact with the police 1.4%, or 574,000, reported use of force or the threat of use of force being directed at them. About a quarter of the 574,000 incidents involved the police officer pointing the gun at the subject of the incident and 53.5% of the incidents saw the officer using physical force such as kicking, grabbing, and pushing. In addition, 13.7% of those that had force used against them or were threatened with the use of force submitted complaints to the offending officer&#x27;s department. Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.

A report by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; found that 385 Americans were fatally shot by law enforcement officers in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades.

U.S. military personnel on guard duty are given a &quot;use of force briefing&quot; by the sergeant of the guard before being assigned to their post.

==Officer attributes==
===Education===

Studies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education. In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered &quot;reasonable&quot; force. Despite these findings, very little – only 1% – of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces. Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field.

===Experience===
It is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting. These skills tend to be better gained through repeated exposure to law enforcement situations while in the line of work. The results as to whether or not the amount of experience an officer has contributes to the likelihood that they will use force differ among studies.

=== Other characteristics ===
It has not been strongly found that the race, class, gender, age etc. of an officer affects the likelihood that they will use force. Situational factors may come into play.

==== Split-second syndrome ====
Split-second syndrome is an example of how use of force can be situation-based. Well-meaning officers may resort to the use of force too quickly under situations where they must make a rapid decision.

===Police dogs===
A 2020 investigation coordinated by the Marshall Project found evidence of widespread deployment of police dogs in the U.S. as disproportionate force and disproportionately against people of color. A series of 13 linked reports, found more than 150 cases from 2015 to 2020 of K-9 officers improperly using dogs as weapons to catch, bite and injure people. The rate of police K-9 bites in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a majority-Black city of 220,000 residents, averages more than double that of the next-ranked city, Indianapolis, and nearly one-third of the police dog bites are inflicted on teenage men, most of whom are Black. medical researchers found that police dog attacks are &quot;more like shark attacks than nips from a family pet” due to the aggressive training police dogs undergo. Many people bitten were not violent and were not suspected of crimes. Police officers are often shielded from liability, and federal civil rights laws don’t typically cover bystanders who are bitten by mistake. Even when victims can bring cases, lawyers say they struggle because jurors tend to love police dogs.

==Departmental attributes==
Policies on use of force can differ between departments. The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer&#x27;s likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the Rodney King case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to use force, rather than how to use force.

One departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers. In one study body cameras were shown to reduce the use of force by as much as 50%.

== Crime levels ==
At the micro level, violent crime levels in the neighborhood increase the likelihood of law enforcement use of force. In contrast, at the meso level, violent neighborhood crime does not have that much effect on use of force.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to police and any other person from Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which states:

&quot;A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large&quot;.

Use of force may be considered lawful if it was, on the basis of the facts as the accused honestly believed them, necessary and reasonable.

(Further provision about when force is &quot;reasonable&quot; was made by section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.)
==Japan==

In Japan, the use of weapons is the pinnacle of the intensity of the use of force by Japanese police officers. There is no clear-cut provision in the actual law regarding the degree to which the use of force is permissible as a means of arrest, except in the case of the use of weapons. 

Under , police officers may use weapons to apprehend criminals, prevent escape, protect themselves or others, or deter resistance to the execution of official duties. However, the use of weapons is limited to &quot;the extent reasonably necessary in the circumstances,&quot; and, except in the case of self-defense or execution of an arrest warrant, may only be used to arrest or prevent the escape of a criminal for a serious violent crime or a criminal for whom an arrest warrant has been issued, or to deter resistance to the execution of official duties. The use of weapons is limited to the purpose of apprehending or preventing the escape of an offender who has been charged with a serious violent crime or for whom an arrest warrant has been issued, or to restraining a serious violent crime.

This requirement of &quot;to the extent deemed reasonably necessary&quot; clarifies the so-called principle of police proportionality, which is understood to apply to the use of tangible force in general. According to the &quot;Guidelines for the Work and Activities of Police Officers Focusing on the Prevention of Injuries and Accidents&quot; (issued by the Deputy Commissioner of the National Police Agency on May 10, 1962), depending on the ferocity and resistance of the other party, the possible means include &quot;using a baton and arrest techniques,&quot; &quot;drawing a gun,&quot; &quot;holding a gun,&quot; &quot;threatening to shoot,&quot; and &quot;shooting at the other party. The attitude and manner in which they can be used are shown step by step. Although it is understood that a baton and cane do not constitute &quot;weapons&quot; as defined in the Police Duties Execution Law, there are precedents that have held that if they are used in a manner that kills or injures a person beyond their intended use, they are in effect equivalent to the use of weapons.

The following three types of crimes are defined by the National Public Safety Commission&#x27;s Rules on the Use and Handling of Guns by Police Officers and Other Personnel (National Public Safety Commission Rule 7):
*Crimes that cause fear or anxiety in society by threatening to harm the life or body of an unspecified person or many people, or destroy important facilities or equipment: illegal use of explosives and arson of an existing building are listed as examples.
*Crimes that endanger the life or body of a person: murder, assault, etc.
*Crimes that are likely to cause harm to a person&#x27;s life or body and are committed in a manner that is extremely awe-inspiring, such as by carrying a deadly weapon.

When special judicial police personnel such as Japan Coast Guard officers, narcotics officers, or self-defense force soldiers on public security missions use weapons, the Police Duties Execution Law will be applied mutatis mutandis based on the respective laws. In addition, in cases where a vessel is targeted, no matter where the target is, there is a possibility of harm to a person, it is difficult to shoot reliably, and it is difficult for patrol vessels to approach a suspect vessel inadvertently, etc. Taking into consideration the special characteristics of the maritime environment, the Japan Coast Guard Law provides that even if it does not constitute a crime, it is possible to take measures against dangerous acts at sea, such as The Japan Coast Guard Act allows the use of weapons for measures against dangerous acts at sea and for on-site inspections to confirm the identity of vessels, etc., even if they do not fall under the requirements for constituting a crime. These provisions also apply to JSDF soldiers in units ordered to conduct maritime security operations and anti-piracy operations.

<doc id="1155143" wikidata="Q4119802" url="?curid=1155143" title="John 21">
<text>John 21 is the twenty-first and final chapter of the Gospel of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It contains an account of a post-crucifixion appearance in Galilee, which the text describes as the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples. In the course of this chapter, there is a miraculous catch of 153 fish, the confirmation of Peter&#x27;s love for Jesus, a foretelling of Peter&#x27;s death, and a comment about the beloved disciple&#x27;s future. 
== Text ==
The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 25 verses.

===Textual witnesses===
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:
*Papyrus 66 (c. AD 200; extant verses 1–9, 12, 17)
*Papyrus 109 (3rd century; extant verses 18–20, 23–25)
*Codex Vaticanus (325–350)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330–360; complete)
*Papyrus 122 (4th/5th century; extant verses 11–14, 22–24)
*Codex Bezae (c. 400)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400–440)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; complete)
*Papyrus 59 (7th century; extant verses 7, 12–13, 15, 17–20, 23)

== Later addition? ==
=== Scholarly discussions ===
According to Helmut Koester (2000), similar to the &quot;Pericope Adulterae&quot;, , though present in all extant manuscripts, is also widely recognized as a later addition. A redactor is thought by some to have later added some text to the original author&#x27;s work. Arguments in favour of this hypothesis include:
*John 20:30–31 could be &#x27;the original ending of the gospel, which is repeated in an exaggerated version in .&#x27; 20:30–31 summarizes the many signs which Jesus performed for his followers, not all of which could be recorded in the Gospel.
*The Restoration of Peter () emphasises the ecclesiastical leadership of Peter, which may indicate that this addition was intended to take a side in &#x27;a later discussion on competing claims of apostolic authorities&#x27;, especially in , in which Jesus instructs Peter to &#x27;Tend my sheep!&#x27;, meaning to lead the flock (=lay people) as a pastor (literally &#x27;shepherd&#x27;). 
*The part about the disciple whom Jesus loved () &#x27;underlines the authority of the special tradition of this gospel as the report of an eyewitness.&#x27; In particular, 21:24 shows a close resemblance to the earlier comment about the reliability of the eyewitness in . This assertion to the credibility of the gospel, with the claim that it is based on an eyewitness account, seems to be at odds with the climax of the original gospel, where, after Doubting Thomas comes to believe in Jesus&#x27;s resurrection, those who believe &quot;without having seen&quot; are blessed above those who need evidence in order to believe (John 20:24–29).

Scholars opposing a later addition by another author have argued the following:
*No existing manuscript of the Gospel of John omits chapter 21.
*Westcott proposed a theory that the author simply decided to add an additional incident at some time after writing the book, but before final publication. In this view, the redactor and the original author are the same person.
*Donald Guthrie commented: &#x27;It is unlikely that another author wrote this section since there are several points of contact in it with the style and language of previous chapters.&#x27;
*Paul N. Anderson and Ben Witherington III argue that the appendix was added after the disciple whom Jesus loved had died, at which point the gospel reached its final form.

===Manuscript evidence===
The Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece (27th ed.) as well as major translations of the New Testament (e.g. KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV) retain this chapter in their editions as original.

In an essay contributed on behalf of scholars unconvinced of any decisive sense of &quot;originality&quot; to John 21 (published in 2007), Jesuit author Felix Just wrote: &quot;We (unfortunately!) do not possess any ancient manuscript of John that actually ends at .&quot; In other words, ancient manuscripts that contain the end of John 20 also contain text from John 21. So if John 21 is an addition, it was so early (which is not in doubt: part of John 21 appears in P66) and so widespread, that no evidence of the prior form has survived.

&quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; (NA28) and the United Bible Societies (UBS5) provide the critical text for John 21.

In 2006, following the discovery of a 4th-century Sahidic papyrus manuscript (Bodleian MS. Copt.e.150(P)) some scholars speculated that such text may end at 20:31, but this is not conclusive due to its fragmentary state.

== Contents ==
===Breakfast by the Sea of Tiberias (verses 1–14)===
====Verses 1–2====
:&quot;After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.&quot;

:&quot;Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.&quot;
Of these seven disciples, the last two remain unnamed. Ernst Hengstenberg suggests they may have been Andrew and Philip, whereas Heinrich Meyer suggests they were non-apostolic disciples from the wider group of those who followed Jesus.

====Verse 4====
:&quot;But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.&quot;
The setting was in the &quot;early morning&quot;, or at dawn. Alfred Plummer notes that a better translation is &quot;Jesus came and stood on the beach.

====Verse 11====

:&quot;So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.&quot;
Two points about the catch of fish are emphasized here:
# there were 153 large fish in the net. 
# even with so many, the net was not torn. 
Both are the kind of thing that would remain in the mind of a person who had witnessed them firsthand.

The number 153 is the 17th triangular number, as well as the sum of the first five positive factorials, and is associated with the geometric shape known as the &quot;Vesica Piscis&quot; (literally, &quot;bladder of a fish&quot;) or &quot;Mandorla&quot;, which Archimedes, in his &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, referred to in the ratio 153/265 as constituting the &quot;measure of the fish&quot;, being an imperfect representation of 1/. Augustine of Hippo argued the significance of 153 being the sum of the first 17 integers is that 17 represents the combination of divine grace (the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit) and law (the Ten Commandments).

====Verse 14====
:&quot;This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.&quot;
Irish Archbishop John McEvilly suggests the count is based on Jesus&#x27; appearances to his disciples &quot;collectively&quot;.

===Jesus restores Peter (verses 15–19)===

Jesus restores Peter to fellowship after Peter had previously denied him, and tells Peter to feed Jesus&#x27; sheep. This restoration of Peter occurs in verses 21:15–19.

===The Disciple whom Jesus loved (verses 20–23)===

The description of the &quot;beloved disciple&#x27;s&quot; (normally assumed to be John the Apostle) fate is presented as an aside to Peter. Jesus says that it is not Peter&#x27;s concern, even if Jesus should wish that that disciple remain alive until the end of time. The following verse clarifies that Jesus did not say &quot;This disciple will not die&quot;, but that it was not for Peter to know.

The last appearance of the &#x27;Disciple whom Jesus loved&#x27; in this Gospel, together with his first appearance in chapter 1 form a literary &quot;&quot;inclusio&quot; of eyewitness testimony&quot; to privilege this witness (in the Gospel of John 21:24) over Peter&#x27;s, not to denigrate Peter&#x27;s authority, but rather to claim a distinct qualification as an &#x27;ideal witness&#x27; to Christ, because he survives Peter and bears his witness after Peter. Bauckham notes the occurrence of at least two specific words in the narratives of both the first and the last appearance of this disciple: &quot;to follow&quot; (Greek: &quot;) and &quot;to remain/stay&quot; (Greek: &quot;). In the first chapter verse it is stated that &quot;Jesus turned, and seeing them following (&#x27;akolouthountas&#x27;), said to them, &quot;What do you seek?&quot;&quot;, then in verse they &quot;remained (&#x27;emeinan&#x27;) with Him that day&quot;. In John 21, the last appearance of the &#x27;Disciple whom Jesus loved&#x27; is indicated using similar words: in verse it is written that &quot;Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (&#x27;akolouthounta&#x27;)&quot;, then in verse &quot;Jesus said to him [Peter], &quot;If I will that he remain (&#x27;menein&#x27;) till I come, what is that to you?&quot; The appearances are also close to Peter&#x27;s, as the first one, along with Andrew, happened just before Peter&#x27;s, who was then given the name &#x27;Cephas&#x27; (alluding to Peter&#x27;s role after Jesus&#x27; departure), and the last one, just after Jesus&#x27; dialogue with Peter, acknowledging the significance of Peter&#x27;s testimony within &quot;the Petrine&#x27;s &quot;inclusio&quot;&quot;, which is also found in the Gospel of Mark and Luke (see Luke 8 under &quot;The Women who sustained Jesus&quot;).

=== Conclusion (verses 24–25) ===
The chapter and the whole book are closed by two verses referring to the author of the gospel in the third person (&quot;We know that his testimony is true&quot;):

==== Verse 24 ====
:&quot;This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.&quot;

==== Verse 25 ====
:&quot;And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.&quot;

Although ever since the 2nd century some people have taken verse 24 to mean that the author of the Gospel of John himself was the eyewitness (namely the disciple whom Jesus loved), other scholars point out that this verse indicates that the author is someone other than this disciple, because he is speaking about himself in the first person plural (&#x27;we know&#x27;) and the disciple in the third person (&#x27;the disciple... who has written all these things&#x27;). Therefore, the author merely claims to have used an earlier written report, allegedly from this disciple, as a source for writing the Fourth Gospel.

<text>The German Church () in Liverpool is in Bedford Street South/ Canning Street and is part of the German speaking churches of North England.

The North of England German Protestant churches are members of the &quot;Synod of German-speaking Lutheran, Reformed and United Congregations in Great Britain&quot; and come under the care of the overseas department of the Protestant Church in Germany.
Services in German are held twice a month on the first (4:00 pm) and third Sundays (11:00 am).

Regular Groups include a Faith discussion group, Wirral Circle and a Toddler Play Group.

== Origins ==
In the 1840s an English cleric from the Church of England (Anglican Communion) came across a prayer meeting of some Germans in a disused ship on the River Mersey, a man was ordained and ministered to this congregation. Initially it was a German-speaking congregation in the Church of England, later to become affiliated with the Lutheran-Protestant church.

This is the origin of the German Lutheran-Protestant (E.K.D.) congregation in Liverpool. After using many different buildings for worship and education, it built its own structure in 1960.

<doc id="1155151" wikidata="Q7546939" url="?curid=1155151" title="Snailbeach District Railways">
<text>Snailbeach District Railways was a British narrow gauge railway in Shropshire. It was built to carry lead ore from mines in the Stiperstones to Pontesbury where the ore was transshipped to the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Minsterley branch line. Coal from the Pontesford coal mines travelled in the opposite direction. The line ended at Snailbeach, the location of Shropshire&#x27;s largest and richest lead mine, though there had been a plan to extend it further, which would have brought it closer to more lead mines.

== History ==

The railway was incorporated by act of parliament on 5 August 1873 and opened in 1877. It was built with an unusual gauge of . The line was prosperous at first, carrying annually and paying a 3% dividend. However, in 1884, the Tankerville Great Consols Company mine, the largest user of the railway, closed, and tonnage fell to .

In 1905, the Ceirog Granite Company opened a quarry near Habberley, and a branch was built to serve this. An extra locomotive was required, and &quot;Sir Theodore&quot; was borrowed from the gauge Glyn Valley Tramway. However, the slight difference in gauge made this locomotive too wide for the track, and it was returned unused. Instead, a new locomotive, &quot;Dennis&quot;, was bought.

Freight reached a peak in 1909 when were carried, but this proved to be a short-term change in fortune for the railway, and demand dwindled again during World War I. In 1923 it was taken over and re-equipped by Colonel Stephens. Stephens bought two new Baldwin locomotives from the War Department Light Railways.

When the mines closed, the line lost much of its traffic but was rescued by a new traffic flow of stone from Callow Hill Quarry. There was virtually no traffic on the upper part of the line but it remained open as the locomotive shed was at Snailbeach.

In 1947 all three remaining steam locomotives were unusable and the railway was moribund. The locomotives were cut up at Snailbeach in 1950. The lower section was leased by Shropshire County Council who used it to transport road-building materials from Callow Hill Quarry to Pontesbury. When the last steam locomotive failed, loaded wagons were run from the quarry to Pontesbury by gravity, and then, when enough were ready, hauled back using a Fordson tractor straddling the rails. The railway finally closed in 1959, the last railway equipment being scrapped in 1961. The Talyllyn Railway purchased the remaining track.

The quarry remained open but the railway was lifted and, between Callow Hill and the road bridge at Pontesbury, converted into a road. Shropshire County Council ran their lorries along this road and paid rent to the railway company. As lorries became larger the long single-track road from Callow Lane to the quarry became impractical and was closed. A new access road was built in 1998 from the A488 in Pontesbury to the quarry at Callow Hill, when the quarry was extended and deepened. Shropshire County Council sold the quarry to Tarmac plc, in 2003. Quarrying permission existed until 2013. As at late 2006 there was no active work at the quarry and most heavy machinery had been removed.

== Line preservation ==

The railway company was still in existence in 1984 when it was put up for sale (offers in the region of £25,000). The sale included the company records as well as the land. The only parts that were sold were the Callow Hill quarry and the trackbed from the exchange sidings at Pontesbury through to Callow Lane near Minsterley. A small section of land was sold to private purchasers at Snailbeach (near Prospect House and Cottages) and the Crowsnest terminal. A small section near the Plox Green road bridge is owned by Shropshire Council and is said to be lead contaminated due to drainage from the spoil piles. A small parcel of land covering the trackbed on the other side of this bridge is used as a playing field and the Snailbeach Village Hall.

Income was expected from the lease to the county council (lasting until 1997) and from wayleaves for services laid along the old trackbed.

Callow Hill Quarry (2006) is owned by Tarmac plc and largely mothballed. Occasional quarry products are transported only a short distance along the route of the old railway to a public road (A488) leading to Pontesbury.

Some remnants of the railway can still be seen, notably in Snailbeach, where the engine shed has been restored and rails remain in place on the lines leading to the old mines, and a reconstructed hopper wagon is available for inspection.

<text>Eduardo Marturet (born September 19, 1953) is a Venezuelan conductor and composer represented by Tempo Primo. He is the Music Director and Conductor of The Miami Symphony Orchestra (MISO).

== Biography ==
Eduardo Marturet enjoys an active career on three continents. As the Music Director and Conductor of The Miami Symphony Orchestra, he remains deeply involved in the musical life of his native Venezuela and continues to guest conduct actively in Europe. He has made more than 60 CDs that range from a Brahms orchestral cycle to surveys of Latin America&#x27;s greatest orchestral composers.
European orchestras with which he has had an active guest conducting relationship include Berliner Symphoniker, European Community Chamber Orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, RAI Symphony Orchestra, Danish Radio Symphony, Royal Flemish Philarmonique, Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, Gelders Orkest, Bohemian Chamber Philharmonic, Budapest Radio Symphony, Brabant Orkest, and Concertgebouw Chamber Orchestra in Amsterdam. In 2001, he led the Berliner Symphoniker on a 12-concert tour of major South American cities including Caracas, São Paulo, Cordoba, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. A documentary of the tour was broadcast through the region by DirecTV.
Born in Caracas, Marturet studied in Cambridge, England where he became firmly rooted in the European tradition, obtaining a degree in Piano, Percussion, Conducting, and Composition. In 1979, he returned to Venezuela with a permanent position with the Orquesta Filarmónica de Caracas as Associate Conductor and later as Artistic Director to the Orquesta Sinfónica Venezuela, where he served in that position until 1995. Presently, he maintains close contact with the Venezuelan National Youth Orchestra movement, giving advice and support in aid of poor children.
With the opening of the Teresa Carreño Theatre in Caracas in 1984, Marturet became its first Music Director. After three years of bringing challenging and original productions to the stage, he resigned from the Theatre to dedicate himself entirely to an international career, conducting in Italy, Greece, France, Spain, England, Denmark, Holland, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Canada and the United States.
He made his Asian debut with the Seoul Philharmonic in 2003, a year when he also opened the Chorin Summer Festival in Berlin and made his debut with the Buenos Aires Philharmonic in Argentina and the Florida Philharmonic in Miami.

In 2006, he received a Latin Grammy nomination for &quot;Encantamento&quot; in the category of Best Classical Album conducting the Berliner Symphoniker.

Since 2006 he has been the Music Director and Conductor of the Miami Symphony Orchestra, during his 15-year tenure Maestro Marturet has taken MISO into the world-class professional symphony of Miami developing a unique classical-crossover repertoire in alliance with great producers such as Emilio Estefan, Rudy Perez and Burt Bacharach.

In October 2012, he was named one of the “100 most influential latinos in Miami”. The ceremony was performed by Fusionarte Association, Pan-American Foundation and Televisa publishing. This same year, in March, the flag of the United States was flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of Eduardo Marturet, who received the Medal of Merit of the U.S. Congress in recognition for his outstanding and invaluable service to the community.

More recently, in 2019, was included into the Genius 100 Visions Group, “an active and engaged community of 100 exceptionally imaginative and impactful human beings. Genius 100 brings accomplished and compassionate minds together to re-imagine the future - and to implement creative initiatives to improve it.

The organization is inspired by Albert Einstein’s words: “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels,” and it includes world renown luminaries like US Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, architect Frank Gehry, and conductor Zubin Mehta, all great visionaries [who] raise the bar on what is achievable within their fields. Collectively, in collaboration, they can make the impossible possible.

His wife Athina Klioumi is a Greek born actress, fashion model, producer philanthropist that supports The Miami Symphony Orchestra.

<doc id="1155173" wikidata="Q2225316" url="?curid=1155173" title="Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)">
<text>Fred Jones is a fictional character in the American animated series &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, leader of a quartet of teenage mystery solvers and their Great Dane companion, Scooby-Doo. Fred has been primarily voiced by Frank Welker since the character&#x27;s inception in 1969.

==Character description==
In most series, Fred wears a white and/or blue shirt and blue pants. In the original series, Fred wears an orange ascot tie with a blue shirt and white sweater. In the 1990s direct-to-video films, Fred generally wears a light blue shirt. In the 2002 series &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;, Fred&#x27;s outfit was given an update, with his orange ascot being replaced with a blue stripe. He is often shown constructing various Rube Goldberg traps for villains, which Scooby-Doo or Shaggy often set off by mistake, causing the villain to be captured in another way. Fred usually takes the lead in solving mysteries. When searching for clues, Fred and Daphne usually go together with Velma coming along, but sometimes Fred and Daphne pair off, leaving Velma to go with Shaggy and Scooby. Although generally a very nice guy, Fred can be bossy at times forcing Shaggy and Scooby to take part in nabbing the villain despite their fears and/or better judgment.

According to &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, his boyhood nickname was &quot;Pickle&quot;. He was voted &quot;Best Looking&quot; in school and was once part of a performance troupe before he devoted himself to solving mysteries. His drama training helps him get into the minds of the villains the gang faces. Daphne says that whenever they&#x27;re feeling particularly scared, Fred would sing songs from &quot;Show Boat&quot; to soothe them. Fred one day hopes to be a famous mystery writer where he hopes to use all of his talents to the fullest.

In &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, Fred was depicted as being somewhat less intelligent and often believed crazy conspiracy theories and legends such as Bigfoot and mole people and read the magazine &quot;The National Exaggerator&quot;. In each episode, Fred would blame the crime on the neighborhood bully, Red Herring (a play on the idiom red herring). In &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;, the teenage version of Fred is shown to have many interests such as traps, martial arts, wrestling, and weightlifting. In &quot;Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated&quot;, his interests are limited to &quot;traps and solving mysteries&quot;, although later he admits he has feelings and dates Daphne.

==Development==

Fred Jones was inspired by the titular character of the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, as played by Dwayne Hickman. Some network sales presentation art from an early version of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s S-S-Scared?&quot;, featured early designs of Fred with brown hair.

Originally named &quot;Ronnie&quot; when production for &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; began in spring 1969, Fred was named by and after Fred Silverman, who was then head of daytime programming at CBS and a key member of the show&#x27;s development team. Frank Welker, a young comedian and impressionist, was asked by the network to audition for the voice of Fred, although he had originally intended to audition for first Scooby-Doo (whom he eventually did get to voice after Don Messick died in 1997) and later Shaggy (Casey Kasem, who was cast as Shaggy, had originally wanted to voice Fred). Being cast as Fred led to the start of a long, prolific career in voice work for Welker, with &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; being his first voice acting job.

Fred Jones has been given two different first names. In &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo! Haunted Holidays&quot;, he is called Frederick, while in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map&quot;, he is called Fredward.

In a 2012 r/IAmA, Shaggy Rogers actor Matthew Lillard additionally revealed that the original cut of the 2002 &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film had Fred be revealed to be gay (which is why he always wore an ascot tie), and that Freddie Prinze Jr. had portrayed him as such throughout the film.

In the continuity of &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, it was revealed that Fred&#x27;s father Fred Jones Sr. was not, in fact, his biological father, but instead, a man who kidnapped him as a child and raised him as his own son. His biological parents Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves later returned, but Fred continued to use the last name of Jones. In the series finale, when the universe is restarted to where Fred was never raised by Fred Jones Sr., but rather his biological parents, it is never stated what his last name is in a new reality. In &quot;Aloha, Scooby-Doo!&quot;, his middle name is stated to be Herman. While every member of the mystery gang is shown to have a catchphrase they use to express shock or surprise, Fred is the only member without one.

<text>Aleuria aurantia (orange peel fungus) is a widespread ascomycete fungus in the order Pezizales. The bright orange, cup-shaped ascocarps often resemble orange peels strewn on the ground, giving this species its common name.

==Taxonomy==
Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described the orange peel as &quot;Peziza aurantia&quot; in 1800. The specific epithet is the Latin word &quot;aurantia&quot; &quot;orange&quot;. Karl Wilhelm Gottlieb Leopold Fuckel placed it the genus &quot;Aleuria&quot; in 1870.

==Description==
The orange fruiting body is wide, cup-shaped, externally fuzzy, and often misshapen due to crowding from other fruiting bodies. The spores produce a white spore print, and scatter in visible clouds when disturbed.

=== Similar species ===
Similar species include &quot;Acervus epispartius&quot;, &quot;Caloscypha fulgens&quot;, &quot;Sarcoscypha coccinea&quot;, &quot;Sowerbyella rhenana&quot;, and members of the genera &quot;Melastiza&quot;, &quot;Otidea&quot;, &quot;Peziza&quot;, &quot;Pithya&quot;, and &quot;Pulvinula&quot;. Particularly In Europe, &quot;A.&quot;&quot;aurantia&quot; may be confused with species of &quot;Otidea&quot; or &quot;Caloscypha&quot; which are poisonous or of unknown edibility.

==Distribution and habitat==
The orange peel fungus grows throughout North America, from November to March in the West and May to November in the East. It can also be found in south Chile and in Europe. It fruits mainly on bare clay or disturbed soil.

==Uses==
It is generally regarded as edible, though difficult to collect intact and not necessarily choice. It can be served in thin slices and preserved by drying.

<text>Jared Lawrence Hess (born July 18, 1979) and Jerusha Elizabeth Hess ( Demke, born May 12, 1980) are husband-and-wife American filmmakers best known for their work on &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; (2004), &quot;Nacho Libre&quot; (2006) and &quot;Gentlemen Broncos&quot; (2009), all of which they co-wrote and which were directed by Jared (&quot;Nacho Libre&quot; was co-written with Mike White). For their film &quot;Ninety-Five Senses&quot;, they were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short.

They also produced music videos for The Postal Service&#x27;s third single, &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes,&quot; and the Killers Christmas charity single &quot;Boots.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jerusha was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and Jared was born in Glendale, Arizona. Jared attended Manhattan High School in Kansas for two years before transferring to Preston High School in Idaho, from which he graduated in 1997. Many scenes from &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; were filmed there. As a teenager Jared worked in film production with T. C. Christensen.

The Hesses have four children. The family are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Career==
Jared met Jerusha while attending Brigham Young University&#x27;s (BYU) film school. Together they co-wrote the film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, which was produced and edited by their classmate Jeremy Coon.

While at BYU, Jared wrote and directed a student film entitled &quot;Cardboard Only&quot;, which is about a seven-year-old Idaho farm boy who struggles to escape boredom while wearing a cardboard box over his head. While at BYU, Jared also wrote and directed a short film entitled &quot;Peluca&quot;, which became a prototype for &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; and featured much of the same cast and plotline, including Jon Heder as Seth, &quot;super nerd extraordinaire.&quot;

Besides &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; and &quot;Peluca&quot;, Jared has worked as a camera assistant in a number of films and has played minor roles in a few Latter-day Saint comedies. These include &quot;The Singles Ward&quot;, &quot;The R.M.&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice: A Latter-day Comedy.&quot; Their second movie &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;, starring Jack Black, was released on June 16, 2006.

The third major film made by the Hesses, &quot;Gentlemen Broncos&quot;, was released in 2009. It is about a teenager who aspires to be a writer, but after attending a fantasy-writer&#x27;s convention, he finds that his idea has been stolen by an established novelist. The film stars Michael Angarano as the teenager, Jemaine Clement as the established novelist, and Sam Rockwell as the story&#x27;s fictional title character who appears in book-come-to-life sequences.

In 2010, Jared created ads for the Utah State Fair which were run on the radio, but refused on television. The Utah State Fair representatives claimed they refused to run them due to sexual overtones, while Hess claimed the failure to run the ads was because the main actor in them, Markus T. Boddie, was an African-American.

In 2011, Jerusha directed a film adaptation of the book &quot;Austenland&quot;, which was released in 2013. She also co-wrote the screenplay.

Jared and Jerusha Hess are also among the executive producers of the &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; series that aired in 2012. In addition, Jared voiced Don Moser, a returning character originally portrayed by Trevor Snarr in the film.

Jared directed the comedy heist film &quot;Masterminds&quot; (2016).

Jared was among the executive producers for the Fox TV series &quot;Making History&quot;, which premiered in 2017.

In 2019, it was announced that Jared would direct with Lynn Wang an animated musical movie adaptation of &quot;Thelma the Unicorn&quot; for Netflix. Both Jared and Jerusha would write it.

Jared co-directed (with Tyler Measom) a true crime docu-series &quot;Murder Among the Mormons&quot;, which premiered on Netflix on March 3, 2021.

<doc id="1155180" wikidata="Q350330" url="?curid=1155180" title="Erik Magnusson, King of Sweden">
<text>Erik Magnusson (1339 – 20 June 1359), sometimes known as Erik XII, was King of Sweden and lord of Scania in 1344–1359. He was a co-ruler with his father, King Magnus Eriksson, from 1356 until his death in 1359.

==Early life==
Erik was born in early 1339 as the eldest son of King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374) who ruled both Sweden and Norway. When Magnus&#x27; second son, Haakon, was born the following year, Magnus decided to divide the kingdoms between his sons. Erik was designated to succeed his father as King of Sweden, while Haakon would become King of Norway during his father&#x27;s lifetime. Although, by Norwegian law, Erik was the rightful heir to the Norwegian throne, the Norwegian Council of the Realm agreed to this arrangement in 1343. In 6 December 1344, Erik was formally elected King of Sweden at the Stones of Mora.

== Marriage ==
In 1342, Magnus&#x27;s brother-in-law Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg, approached Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV to propose a union between Erik and Beatrix of Bavaria, Louis IV&#x27;s granddaughter. Beatrix&#x27;s parents were Louis I of Brandenburg, the eldest son of Emperor Louis, and Margrete, daughter of King Christopher II of Denmark. The marriage aligned with Magnus&#x27;s strategic interests, as Beatrix&#x27;s dynastic claims could strengthen his position in the ongoing conflicts with Valdemar IV of Denmark. Additionally, the union could also advance Magnus&#x27; ambitions in Estonia, which Valdemar had nominally ceded to Louis as compensation for Margrete&#x27;s unpaid dowry. However, both Emperor Louis IV and Louis of Brandenburg had been excommunicated by the Catholic Church, and Magnus had to petition Pope Clement VI regarding the marriage arrangement, as noted in a letter from the pope to the king in 1347.

The exact date of the wedding is unknown. Beatrix is believed to have been around the same age as Erik, and one of Saint Bridget&#x27;s revelations indicates that the marriage took place while she was still a minor. Some sources suggest that the wedding occurred as early as 1346, but the only certainty is that it took place before 25 October 1356.

== Rebellion and death ==
In 1355, Haakon was declared of age, and after that, he was the sovereign ruler of Norway, although his father&#x27;s influence remained significant. In contrast, Erik held no power while his father continued to reign as King of Sweden.

In 1357, a Swedish rebellion forced King Magnus to share the rule of Sweden with his son Erik, who was allowed domain over most of Scania and Finland. Joint rule of Sweden was established again in 1359 when father and son became reconciled and co-ruled Sweden until Erik&#x27;s death a few months later. Quite soon after his death his wife, Beatrix, died as well. It is generally believed that they both died of the Black Death.

<doc id="1155181" wikidata="Q3878864" url="?curid=1155181" title="Pontesbury">
<text>Pontesbury ( ) is a village and civil parish in Shropshire, and is approximately eight miles southwest of Shrewsbury. In the 2011 census, the village had a population of 1,873 and the parish had a population of 3,227. The village of Minsterley is just over a mile further southwest. The A488 road runs through the village, on its way from Shrewsbury to Bishop&#x27;s Castle. The Rea Brook flows close by to the north with the village itself nestling on the northern edge of the Shropshire Hills AONB. Shropshire Council in their 2015 Place Plan detail the development strategy and refer to Pontesbury and neighbouring Minsterley as towns.

==Local government==
The village is the seat of an extensive civil parish, with its own parish council grouped into five wards, representing the village and outlying areas such as the villages and hamlets of Pontesford, Plealey, Asterley, Cruckton, Cruckmeole, Arscott, Lea Cross, Malehurst etc., as well as Habberley (which was previously a civil parish in its own right until 1967). It hosts an official Pontesbury Parish website.

It is represented on the unitary Shropshire Council and in parliament in the Shrewsbury constituency.

==Housing development==
Several housing developments are reshaping the village, with 86 new homes named Cricketer&#x27;s Meadow, being added at Hall Bank, and 25 homes named Young&#x27;s Piece, built on the site of a former lead smelting area on Minsterley Road. Soil samples taken at the site of Young&#x27;s Piece during the planning application process (since removed) showed lead contamination was in excess of the applicable threshold level/critical concentration. The area was identified as requiring a £1.5M spend to remove lead and arsenic pollution from the ground. An application for outline planning permission has been granted for demolition of The Horseshoes Pub on Minsterley Road to make way for the erection of four houses. The pub occupies the site of an historic lead smelting works and according to the application was designated contaminated land in 2007. An application for 18 houses has been granted off Mount Close. A planning application was submitted in January 2021 for the development of 38 new houses on land opposite the Horseshoes Pub, to be known as Lawrence Park. This application has been granted, having previously been withdrawn and then resubmitted. An environmental geology report found lead concentrations, &#x27;significantly in exceedance of the Generic Acceptance Criterion&#x27;. On 25 August 2022 workers on the Shropshire Homes development uncovered 24 World War II bombs that had previously been safely beneath the plough soil. Because fears that more bombs may remain, work on the site has been halted. The site is listed in the Defence of Britain archive as a defensive location for the 4th Salop Home Guard as a place to attack tanks. These strategic sites often had munitions associated with them. A further application has been made, referred to as phase two, to build an additional four houses on the land between Young&#x27;s Piece and Lawrence Park. No provision will be made for affordable housing, &#x27;due to significant costs associated with the remediation of contamination&#x27;. The land, along with Young&#x27;s Piece and Lawrence Park, formed part of a nineteenth century lead smelting works, resulting in contamination.

==Climate Change==
Pontesbury Climate Emergency Action Group was set up in 2020 with the aim of achieving net zero carbon by 2030. 
Areas currently being focused on include local food and community growing, increasing biodiversity, and encouraging people to use carbon footprint tools to raise awareness. The Parish Council has stated that one of the largest sources of carbon emissions for the council is the new community hub, which was built as part of the Hall Bank development by Shropshire Homes.  The community hub relocated the library and police station from elsewhere in the village.  The Parish Council are now exploring how to reduce its impact.

==Education==
The village is home of a comprehensive school, the Mary Webb School and Science College, named after the local novelist Mary Webb, which serves most of the surrounding villages for pupils age 11–16, on whose premises is the Mary Webb Sports Centre, usable by the public out of school hours. There is also a primary school, on whose premises also meet a pre-school playgroup formed 1990. There is also a nursery school, for children aged 3 months to 4 years, called The Ark, on Hall Bank.

==Other public amenities and services==
Pontesbury is one of the largest villages in Shropshire and so is host to a wide range of local services including independent local shops selling local produce and three public houses (&#x27;The Horseshoes&#x27;, &#x27;The Nag&#x27;s Head&#x27; and &#x27;The Plough&#x27;)

The village also contains a medical practice, dental surgery, post office, police station (under F Division, West Mercia Police), public library, public hall and cemetery.

==Industries and trade==
The village has a long mining history, once linked to Snailbeach and Hanwood via the Minsterley branch line and the Snailbeach District Railways, it supplied local industry with coal, lead, iron and stone. Although the railway tracks are no longer there, the route that it took can still be walked, where some stations and sidings remain. Nearby Poles Coppice, around half-a-mile south of the village, contains two former quarries and is now a countryside recreation area.

==Churches==

In the centre of the village sits St George&#x27;s Church of England parish church, the origins of which can be traced to about 1250 AD but due to the site&#x27;s circular graveyard shape may indicate a much more ancient site of Anglo Saxon or even Celtic origin. The church itself however was largely restored in the 19th century, following the collapse of the mediaeval tower between 1820 and 1825.

The churchyard contains the outdoor parish war memorial. The present Portland stone cross, erected 1963, replaced an earlier elaborate cross by Temple Moore and unveiled in 1921, which bore a crucifix and images of the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and St George and the Dragon but had become dilapidated and was dismantled in 1960.

There are also active Baptist, Methodist and Congregationalist Churches.
The Salvation Army had a barracks in Pontesbury between about 1888–1894.

==Hill==

Nearby is Earl&#x27;s Hill, which is the site of an Iron Age hillfort built around 600 B.C. and making it a Scheduled Ancient Monument and also designated an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) for its wildlife value. It was Shropshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s first nature reserve in 1964. Earl&#x27;s Hill is PreCambrian in origin, being formed approximately 650 million years ago as a result of volcanic activity along the Pontesford-Linley fault.

==Sports==
Local sports clubs include:
*Pontesbury Cricket Club, formed 1875; has 3 hardball teams in Shropshire County Cricket League and one in Shrewsbury Cricket League.
*Pontesbury Bowling Club, formed 1925, both crown green bowls (ground at &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head&quot;: has 3 teams in Wem League and 5 teams in Tanners League) and short mat indoor bowling (meets at Pontesbury Public Hall).
*Pontesbury Football Club, reformed 1987 – plays in Premier Division of the Shrewsbury and District Sunday League.
*Pontesbury Badminton Club, formed 1990.

<text>Saguna brahman ( &#x27;The Absolute with qualities&#x27;; from Sanskrit &quot;&quot; &#x27;with qualities&#x27;, &quot;guṇa&quot; &#x27;quality&#x27;, and &quot;Brahman&quot; &#x27;the Absolute&#x27;) is a concept of ultimate reality in Hinduism, close to the concept of immanence, the manifested divine presence.

==Yoga==
Rājarshi (2001: p. 45) conveys his estimation of the historical synthesis of the School of Yoga (one of the six Āstika schools of Hinduism) which he holds introduces the principle of &quot;Isvara&quot; as Saguna Brahman, to reconcile the extreme views of Vedanta&#x27;s &quot;advandva&quot; and Sankya&#x27;s &quot;dvandva&quot;:
&quot;Introducing the special tattva (principle) called Ishvara by yoga philosophy is a bold attempt to bring reconciliation between the transcendental, nondual monism of vedanta and the pluralistic, dualistic, atheism of sankhya. The composite system of yoga philosophy brings the two doctrines of vedanta and sankya closer to each other and makes them understood as the presentation of the same reality from two different points of view. The nondual approach of vedanta presents the principle of &quot;advandva&quot; (nonduality of the highest truth at the transcendental level.) The dualistic approach of sankhya presents truth of the same reality but at a lower empirical level, rationally analyzing the principle of &quot;dvandva&quot; (duality or pairs of opposites). Whereas, yoga philosophy presents the synthesis of vedanta and sankhya, reconciling at once monism and dualism, the supermundane and the empirical.&quot;

==Vedanta==
According to Dvaita and Vishistadvaita, Brahman is conceived as Saguna Brahman (personal deity) or &quot;Ishvara&quot; (Lord of the universe) with infinite attributes, including form. In Dvaita, Saguna Brahman is distinct from individual souls and the material world. In Vishistadvaita, while Brahman is the supreme reality, the world and souls are its body or modes, making them integral to Brahman. Dvaita and Vishistadvaita considers Saguna Brahman as the ultimate reality and liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;) is attained only by the grace of God. Shankara (Advaita) distinguishes between Saguna Brahman (with qualities) and Nirguna Brahman (without qualities), with Saguna Brahman seen as illusory, and Nirguna Brahman as real.

==Other==
Surya is regarded as Saguna Brahman by Saura (Hinduism), Goddess Shakti (or Parvati, Durga, Kali, Mahalakshmi, or Gayatri) is seen as the Saguna Brahman in Shaktism and Shiva is the Saguna Brahman of Shaivism.

<text>&quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot; is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. Chronologically, it is the first story about Mowgli although it was written after &quot;In the Rukh&quot;, in which Mowgli appears as an old man .

The story first appeared in the January 1894 issue of &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; and was collected as the first story in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; later in 1894 where it is accompanied by the poem &quot;Hunting Song of the Seeonee Pack&quot;. The story also appears in &quot;All the Mowgli Stories&quot;. In 1992 it was published as a separate volume with woodcut illustrations by Christopher Wormell. The text is available on-line from several sources as part of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

The story was adapted as a 25-minute animated television cartoon by Chuck Jones in 1976. Jones also directed adaptations of &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; and &quot;The White Seal&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Father Wolf and Mother Wolf, Raksha, a pair of wolves raising a family of cubs, are furious to learn from Tabaqui the jackal that Shere Khan the lame tiger is hunting in their territory because he might kill men and bring human retribution upon the jungle. When Father Wolf hears something approaching their den, it turns out to be not the tiger, but a naked human baby boy. Raksha decides to adopt the hairless &quot;man-cub&quot;. Her determination is only strengthened by the arrival of Shere Khan, who demands the cub for his meal. The wolves drive off the tiger, and Raksha names him Mowgli, which means frog because of his almost hairless body.

At the wolf pack&#x27;s meeting at Council Rock, Baloo the bear speaks for the man-cub, and Bagheera the black panther buys his life with a freshly killed bull. Baloo and Bagheera undertake the task of educating Mowgli as he grows. Meanwhile, Shere Khan plans to take revenge on the wolf pack by persuading the younger wolves to depose their leader Akela.

When Mowgli is about 11 years old, Bagheera tells him of Shere Khan&#x27;s plan. Mowgli, being human, is the only creature in the jungle that does not fear fire, so he steals a pot of burning coals from a nearby village in order to use it against Shere Khan.

The young wolves prevent Akela from catching his prey, and at that night&#x27;s meeting, Shere Khan demands that Akela be killed and the man-cub given to him. Mowgli, despite being naked and unprotected, relentlessly attacks Shere Khan with a burning branch and drives him and his allies away, but realizes to his sorrow that he must now leave the pack and return to humanity. As he leaves, he vows to return one day and lay Shere Khan&#x27;s hide upon the Council Rock.

==Animated special==

In 1976 &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot; was adapted and directed as a half-hour television animated special of the same name by veteran animator Chuck Jones, with narration and voices by Roddy McDowall, and June Foray as Mother Wolf. Though largely a faithful adaptation of the story, there are some notable changes in Jones&#x27;s version. Differences include expanded roles for Baloo and Tabaqui, and that Shere Khan is a white tiger and there is no reference to his lame leg. Jones also directed adaptations of &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; and &quot;The White Seal&quot;.

<text>Richard Bruce Wright (March 4, 1937 – February 7, 2017) was a Canadian novelist. He was known for his break-through 2001 novel &quot;Clara Callan,&quot; which won three major literary awards in Canada: The Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Governor General&#x27;s Award.

==Early life and education==
Wright was born in Midland, Ontario, to Laverne and Laura (née Thomas). Wright graduated from high school in Midland in 1956, and attended and graduated from Ryerson Polytechnic Institute in the area of radio and TV arts in 1959. He worked briefly within local newspapers and radio stations as a copywriter before becoming an assistant editor for Macmillan Canada in 1960.

== Career ==

=== Debut and success ===
Wright married Phyllis Wright (née Cotton) in 1966 and they have two sons, Christopher Stephen and Richard Andrew. During Wright&#x27;s time at Macmillan, he published his first book, a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Andrew Tolliver&quot; (later retitled &quot;One John A. Too Many&quot;). Wright&#x27;s first full-length novel, &quot;The Weekend Man,&quot; was written in eighteen months while staying at his wife&#x27;s family cottage in Quebec. The novel became a critical success, winning praise for Wright&#x27;s versatility and ability to create believable female characters. In 1970, Wright returned to postsecondary at Trent University, graduating in 1972 with a B.A. in English. In 1976, Wright obtained a position at Ridley College, a private school, teaching English until his retirement.

=== Later career ===
Although nominated for several literary awards, Wright didn&#x27;t gain recognition until 2001 when his novel &quot;Clara Callan&quot; won both the Giller Prize and Governor-General&#x27;s Award. This led to the republication of many of his earlier works. This novel went on to win three of Canada&#x27;s major literary awards: The Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Governor General&#x27;s Award. Wright&#x27;s published works deal with the lives of ordinary people, with a profound balance of depth and sensitivity. Wright had been praised as an author who created believable characters with a voice that must be heard. The reviewer in &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; is just one of many who have praised Wright&#x27;s work, stating that his most recent book, &quot;Mr.Shakespeare&#x27;s Bastard,&quot; is &quot;A masterful novel … [which] confirms his ability to evoke an authentically female sensibility.&quot; The novel has continued to gain recognition and was described by &quot;The Winnipeg Free Press&quot; as a novel that &quot;Draws us swiftly through the pages...&quot; Wright provides a narrative of pure life to his settings and character backgrounds that have continued to give him wide recognition as a Canadian novelist. His novels have been, and continue to be, published all around the world. In 2006, Wright received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Trent University, and in 2007 he became a member of the Order of Canada.

== Later life and death ==
He lived in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he wrote full-time and enjoyed the recreational pastimes of walking, reading and music. Wright died in hospital on the morning of February 7, 2017 as a result of a stroke. He was 79.

<doc id="1155191" wikidata="Q760904" url="?curid=1155191" title="Rizzo the Rat">
<text>Rizzo the Rat is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, created and originally performed by Steve Whitmire until 2016.

He is a fictional rat who appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and numerous films, with a starring role in the 1992 film &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;.

The character is particularly associated with Gonzo the Great, with the two sharing a double act since 1992. Whitmire based the character on Ratso Rizzo in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;.

==Character==
Rizzo is a streetwise and sarcastic rat with a New Jersey accent. He is a self-proclaimed acrophobe. His humor can be risqué, as in the TV series &quot;The Muppets&quot;
where he was given the line, &quot;Is ABC going to be OK with &#x27;Mother Teresa on a stick&#x27;?&quot; To avoid potential difficulty with real-life censors, alternative lines were filmed.

Rizzo&#x27;s family has been mentioned in Muppet media. He has 1,274 brothers and sisters, as told to Gonzo in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;. In 2016, Disney claimed that Rizzo came from a family of pizza makers as part of the backstory of the new PizzeRizzo restaurant at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios.

==History==

Rizzo&#x27;s name is derived from Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s Ratso Rizzo character in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. Steve Whitmire created the character, based on rats he had previously made out of bottles.

Rizzo first appeared in episode 48 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, as one of many rats following Christopher Reeve backstage. He can be seen mugging and reacting to practically every line of dialogue. He remained a scene-stealing background figure through the final season, occasionally performing with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. By the time of &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, Whitmire had been performing Rizzo for around 12 years.

After the series, he appeared in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; as a bellboy in a fleabag London hotel. He has appeared in most later Muppet projects, including &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;. In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, he developed a double act with Gonzo, with director Brian Henson and the crew envisioning Rizzo as &quot;pain-in-the-neck sidekick.&quot; The characters narrate, break the fourth wall, and Rizzo challenges Gonzo&#x27;s claims to be Charles Dickens. The Gonzo and Rizzo partnership was continued in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, with Rizzo again offering a humorous critique of the handling of the story, and in &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;. Along with Kermit and Gonzo, Rizzo gave an audio commentary for the &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; DVD.

Rizzo appears as a background character in the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, without a spoken dialogue, although he is seen singing along during the finale, as well as the scene in which Kermit the Frog addresses a large crowd of Muppets. In &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), and the short feature &quot;Rizzo&#x27;s Biggest Fan&quot; on the Blu-ray release, the character calls for more screentime. Rizzo returned to prominence in the TV series &quot;The Muppets&quot;, where he was on a writing crew with Gonzo and Pepe the King Prawn.

In October 2016, Whitmire was dismissed by The Muppets Studio. Benjamin Diskin voiced baby Rizzo in the animated series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; (2018–2022). No replacement performer for Rizzo has been announced.

<text>Knee Deep in the Hoopla is the debut album by American AOR band Starship, the succeeding musical project to Jefferson Starship. It was released on September 12, 1985, by RCA and Grunt.

The album spawned four singles which all charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: the No. 1 hits &quot;We Built This City&quot; and &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Doesn&#x27;t Matter Tonight&quot; (No. 26) and &quot;Before I Go&quot; (No. 68).

== Background ==
In May 1984, Jefferson Starship released &quot;Nuclear Furniture&quot;. Paul Kantner, one of the band&#x27;s founding members, left shortly after, criticizing the group&#x27;s tilt toward commercial rock. In October, he sought to dissolve the band and sued his former bandmates over the ownership of its name. The lawsuit was settled in March 1985 with the agreement that the &quot;Jefferson Starship&quot; name would be retired by the group in favor of &quot;Starship&quot;, a name now owned by singer Grace Slick and manager Bill Thompson. 

Shortly after the new group&#x27;s creation, David Freiberg (another Jefferson Starship founding member) departed as well. For the band&#x27;s debut album, the lineup was reduced to a quintet consisting of singer Grace Slick, co-lead singer Mickey Thomas, guitarist Craig Chaquico, bassist Pete Sears, and drummer Donny Baldwin.

== Recording and production ==
Peter Wolf, who had worked on &quot;Nuclear Furniture&quot;, was hired to produce &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot;. As the band sought a new, radio relevant sound, Wolf brought novel recording techniques. Among these was the use of the Synclavier, which guitarist Craig Chaquico later described as &quot;cutting edge,&quot; adding that despite the changes, the group did not feel like they were &quot;selling out,&quot; but rather felt like &quot;they were trying to land a man on the moon.&quot; However, short-term member David Freiberg recalled in a 1997 interview that one of the reasons for his departure was that in the studio &quot;nobody in the band was playing anything&quot; as it was all about &quot;producing&quot; and &quot;hot stuff keyboard players.&quot;

For the album, Wolf also sourced material from a wide variety of outside songwriters, which was said to have made the group more &quot;unified and focused&quot;. This was an important change from the old lineup&#x27;s previous albums, as the songs were primarily written by its members. &quot;We Built This City&quot; was the first product from these new recording efforts and the album&#x27;s lead single. Originally written by Bernie Taupin (lyricist known for his work with Elton John) and Martin Page, the track was further developed by Wolf and co-producers Dennis Lambert and Jeremy Smith. The album&#x27;s title was taken from one of the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight&quot;. The second single, &quot;Sara&quot;, was a ballad written by Wolf and his wife, Ina Wolf, and named after Mickey Thomas&#x27; then-wife. Both of these songs reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

The track &quot;Desperate Heart&quot;, written by Michael Bolton and Randy Goodrum, also appeared on Bolton&#x27;s album &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Crazy&quot;, released earlier that year in March. &quot;Rock Myself to Sleep&quot; was written by Katrina and the Waves members Kimberley Rew and Vince de la Cruz and featured additional vocals by Quiet Riot&#x27;s Kevin DuBrow. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Love Rusts&quot;, also written by Page and Taupin, featured additional background vocals by artists like Peter Beckett (from Player), Simon Climie (later of Climie Fisher fame), and Siedah Garrett. The only song on the record written by any of the band&#x27;s members was &quot;Private Room&quot;, penned by vocalist Mickey Thomas and guitarist Craig Chaquico. The music video for the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Tomorrow Doesn&#x27;t Matter Tonight&quot; was directed by Francis Delia (director of the videos for &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;We Built This City&quot;) and shot in a converted warehouse located in downtown Los Angeles. The set was designed by Waldemar Kalinoswky.

Two songs sung by Grace Slick were recorded for but left off the album: Slick&#x27;s own &quot;Do You Remember Me?&quot; (released on &quot;The Best of Grace Slick&quot;) and the Peter Wolf–Jeremy Smith composition &quot;Casualty&quot; (included as a bonus track on the remastered 1999 CD edition of the album). Pete Sears and his wife, Jeannette, wrote a song for the album titled &quot;One More Innocent&quot;, which was rejected due to its political lyrics.

In November 1985, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Slick characterized the sound on the album as &quot;cleaner, more crisp&quot;, while Thomas called it &quot;more current, and more focused.&quot; In September, the publication also wrote that the album had been &quot;tentatively titled &#x27;Another American Dream Goes Berserk&#x27;.&quot;

Reflecting on the creation of &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot;, vocalist Mickey Thomas would later say that:&quot;[with the album] we definitely made a conscious effort to sort of redefine ourselves and say: &#x27;Let’s go in and try to do a completely different approach to music. Let’s use a different method. Let’s try to have a couple of hit singles. Let’s just go for it&#x27;.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; was released on September 10, 1985, through RCA and Grunt. Four singles were released from the album, which all charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart: the No. 1 hits &quot;We Built This City&quot; and &quot;Sara&quot;, the No. 26 hit &quot;Tomorrow Doesn&#x27;t Matter Tonight&quot; (peaked at No. 26), and the No. 68 &quot;Before I Go&quot;. &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA on 27 December 1985.

On 22 September 2023, &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; was reissued as part of the limited-edition &quot;Rhino Reds&quot; series, launched in celebration of Rhino&#x27;s 45th anniversary. The album was pressed on translucent red vinyl at Third Man and mastered by Jeff Powell. This release also included &quot;Casualty&quot; as a bonus track and was accompanied by a bonus 7&quot; single featuring &quot;We Built This City&quot; and &quot;Private Room&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Joseph McCombs of AllMusic retrospectively described &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; as the Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship/Starship project&#x27;s &quot;most overtly commercial effort to date.&quot; He noted that the album&#x27;s songs &quot;are pleasant but lightweight&quot; and that while they &quot;are less than memorable, they are very tuneful and melodic.&quot; McCombs highlighted &quot;Love Rusts&quot; as the standout cut.

On 7 September 1985, &quot;Cashbox&quot; stated that &quot;We Built This City&quot; was a &quot;must-add,&quot; describing it as an &quot;ear-catching&quot; and &quot;bouncy&quot; song that was &quot;dance rock with sharp hooks&quot; for Contemporary hits radio. On September 21, the magazine said that &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; was &quot;rich in commercial potential and musical satisfaction,&quot; observing that it placed emphasis on &quot;melodic, pop songwriting&quot; and the &quot;vocal interplay&quot; of Slick and Thomas. On the same day, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that with the album, the band took their &quot;techno-rock swing&quot; to a &quot;more decisive stance,&quot; describing the makeover as a shift toward the &quot;mainstream &#x27;80s.&quot;

In November 1985, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the album, as a &quot;compendium of strutting pop-rock cliches,&quot; represented everything Jefferson Airplane stood against: &quot;conformity, conservatism and a slavish adherence to formula.&quot; That same month, &quot;People&quot; argued that &quot;although the producers give Starship’s music some punch,&quot; it was like trying to &quot;resuscitate a pork chop&quot;. They considered &quot;We Built This City&quot; a tease &quot;with nice keyboards by Wolf&quot;, and described the rest of the album as &quot;weary hackwork.&quot; Some days later, &quot;Associated Press&quot; writer Larry Kilman described &quot;We Built this City&quot; as a &quot;short and snappy&quot; song that, with a catchy chorus, was made for radio play. He found the album to be &quot;uneven,&quot; noting that &quot;listeners drawn to it by &#x27;We Built the City&#x27; will enjoy &#x27;Hearts of the World&#x27; but little else.&quot; Kilman also singled out &quot;Love Rusts&quot;, calling it the second-best song on the record. In December, Tom Ford of &quot;The Blade&quot; referred to &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot; as the &quot;quagmire of the commercial music market&quot;, describing the songs on it as &quot;flashy and toothless,&quot; and concluding that there was no vision from the people who &quot;should have some.&quot;

In April 1986, &quot;Cashbox&quot; said that &quot;Mickey Thomas&#x27; sensational lead vocal&quot; kept &quot;Tomorrow Doesn&#x27;t Matter Tonight&quot; &quot;aloft with exhilerating sonic flight,&quot; adding that the track, backed by &quot;searing rock guitars and a churning rhythm,&quot; sliced &quot;like a double bladed sword.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;exemplary American AOR of the &#x27;80s, interrupted only by an ethereal bridge.&quot;

<text>Cecil Farris Bryant (July 26, 1914 – March 1, 2002) was an American politician serving as the 34th governor of Florida. He also served on the United States National Security Council as director of the Office of Emergency Planning during the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who also appointed Bryant chair of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.

==Early life and career==

Bryant was born in Ocala, Marion County, Florida, to Charles Cecil Bryant and Lela Margaret (Farris) Bryant. His paternal grandparents, William Robert Bryant and Amy Emma (Lantz) Bryant, moved to Marion County from Missouri in 1890. Lela Margaret Bryant was the daughter of Oscar A. and Marry M. Farris of Ocala and the sister of Ion Farris, who became a prominent Florida legislator and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 1916. His mother hoped Farris would follow her brother into politics and succeed to become the governor of Florida. According to Bryant, on the day he was born, his mother “had my father hold me up and she said, hello, governor.” His mother, Bryant said, was the force behind his decision to enter politics.

After graduating from Ocala High School, Bryant attended Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1931 to 1932. He pledged Alpha Tau Omega (ATO). Bryant later utilized the ATO social network to help his political campaigns and had ATO brothers on his staff as governor. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Florida in Gainesville in 1935 with a business degree. There he was a member of Florida Blue Key, Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity. Bryant continued his education at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he earned a law degree in 1938.

In 1939, unable to find a decent salaried position in a law office, Bryant took a job as an auditor with the office of the Florida comptroller in Tallahassee. It was in Tallahassee that Bryant met his future wife, Julia Burnett. Born on April 26, 1918, in Madison, Florida, Julia was the daughter of Daniel Felix Burnett Jr. and Eunice Lovett Burnett. She attended and graduated from the Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee. Julia was teaching in Tallahassee when she met Farris Bryant. He proposed on their first date; she accepted on their third. They married on September 18, 1940, in Madison and made their home in Ocala. She and Farris had three children, all daughters: Julie, Cecilia, and Adair. Julia played a key role in assisting Farris in his political campaigns and as the first lady of Florida during his governorship. They were married for fifty-six years until her death in 1996.

As the United States prepared for the possibility of war in 1941, Bryant joined the newly formed Florida State Guard. Soon after the United States entered World War II, he volunteered to join the U.S. Navy. In May 1942, Bryant won election to represent Marion County in the Florida House of Representatives. However, he gave up his seat to stay in the Navy. Bryant was commissioned as an ensign and served as a gunnery officer on oil tankers and Liberty ships in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean in 1943. In 1944, he was transferred to serve aboard a destroyer doing convoy escort duty. Bryant later served in the Pacific against the Japanese. He ended his service as a lieutenant in 1945.

==Florida House of Representatives==

When he returned from the war in 1945, Bryant was determined to regain the Florida House seat that he had given up after joining the Navy. He won election in 1946 and served his first session in the Florida Legislature in 1947 (the legislature had biennial sessions). Bryant served in the Florida House for five more sessions; his last session was in 1957. He sponsored, cosponsored, and supported legislation that led to the expansion of the state&#x27;s junior college system, the creation of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, centralization of state purchasing, and the establishment of the Minimum Foundation Program, which ensured that even the poorest school districts could provide a decent, foundational education for children. And he led the effort to establish the Florida Legislative Council, a research body designed to report on the pros and cons of potential legislation while the legislature was out of session. He was conservative on fiscal matters, supporting economy in government. Influenced by his Methodist faith, Bryant was also conservative on many social issues and supported legislation to limit gambling in the state. His legislative prominence led to his election as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 1953. Bryant had fond memories of his time in the Florida House: &quot;I had more fun in those ten years in the political world than I had at any other time.&quot;

== Gubernatorial campaigns ==

=== 1956 ===
After being elected speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Bryant was determined to run for governor in 1956. His opponents in the Democratic primary were the sitting governor, LeRoy Collins, former governor Fuller Warren, and wealthy businessman and former National Guard general Sumter Lowry. Bryant hoped to win based on his legislative experience, his advocacy of responsible and restrained government spending, and his support for revision of the Florida Constitution. Governor Collins ran on a similar platform, and both men appealed to Florida&#x27;s growing business sector. However, the issue of racial integration overshadowed all other issues in the Democratic primary. Governor Collins believed Florida had to follow federal law and accept the US Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that ruled segregation in public education was inherently unequal and its subsequent decision (&quot;Brown II&quot;) that the states must move to implement integration in their public schools. He and Bryant insisted that integration should be through lawful means, not through rebellion and violence. Bryant said the question of integration must be approached &#x27;&quot;with cool heads, clear minds, and a keen concern for the welfare of all Floridians, black and white.&quot;&#x27; Sumter Lowry ran as a staunch defender of segregation and opposed any compromise with integration brought on by the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. He attacked integration as a Communist-backed conspiracy to destroy the white race in America. Lowry accused Collins and Bryant of being soft on segregation and unwilling to defend states&#x27; rights against federal intrusion. Early on in his campaign, Bryant stated that he did not believe Florida was ready for racial integration: &#x27;“In the homes of Negroes we find different intellectual levels, and moral and sanitary standards. Negroes have come very far in these past 100 years but not as far as they will go in their next 100. I feel that it would not be good for two groups with such different standards to be drawn into direct contact.”’ He hoped that by making his position clear on integration he could move on to campaign on the government reform and pro-growth agenda that he preferred to discuss. However, Lowry&#x27;s uncompromising segregationist platform won support among many Florida Democrats, and he soon became the main challenger to Collins, leaving Bryant and Warren behind. Bryant came in third in the primary. Governor Collins went on to win reelection.

=== 1960 ===

Four years after his loss in 1956, Bryant was the clear front runner in the Democratic race for governor in 1960. He recognized that two of the main reasons for his defeat in 1956 were poor fundraising and lack of a statewide campaign organization. By the time he entered the race in 1960, Bryant had the best funded and best organized campaign in the field of ten candidates in the Democratic primary. After garnering the most votes in the initial primary, Bryant faced a runoff against Doyle E. Carlton Jr., the son of former Florida governor Doyle E. Carlton. Integration was the dominant issue of the runoff election. Both candidates supported segregation and opposed further integration of Florida&#x27;s public schools; however, both men emphasized that opposition to integration must be non-violent and orderly. Carlton was an ally of Governor LeRoy Collins, whose willingness to support gradual integration became a liability for Carlton in 1960. Bryant made effective use of television, radio, and newspapers to call into question Carlton&#x27;s support for segregation while at the same time extolling his own experience and expertise as a legislator and government leader, who proposed a reform agenda of constitutional revision, reapportionment, fiscal restraint, and modernization in education and transportation. His campaign slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Bryant,&quot; saturated the airwaves. White opposition to Civil Rights protests in Florida (in Tallahassee) helped him win the election in 1960. When the polls closed on May 24, 1960, Bryant won a convincing victory. He went on to defeat Republican George C. Peterson in November.

== Governorship ==

=== Inauguration ===

C. Farris Bryant took the oath of office on January 3, 1961. In his inaugural address, Governor Bryant called for unity in the state and an end to political factionalism in the Florida Legislature. He said the people of Florida should expect his term of office to be an administration of the highest standards in its work, morality, and achievements. Bryant called for improvement in education, the hiring of the most qualified people for state positions, cleaning out corruption in the State Road Department, reapportionment, more efficient tax collection, and a minimum level of dignified subsistence for all Floridians. Alluding to how he would handle integration, Bryant insisted that his administration would not interfere in issues “best left in the hands of local officials,” and he would “oppose with vigor any efforts by the federal government to usurp the proper and lawful prerogatives of the state.”

=== Roads ===
Bryant believed the state had to invest in infrastructure to handle the needs of its ever-growing population and to encourage more tourism, which would mean more revenue through the sales tax. A supporter of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (then known as the Sunshine State Parkway) since its inception in 1955, Bryant approved a new bond issue to complete the turnpike by extending it from Fort Pierce on the Atlantic to Wildwood in Sumter County in central Florida. The extension was completed in 1964, during the last months of his administration. Other road building initiatives during the Bryant years included the improvement and completion of US Highway 1, running along Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast from the Georgia border to Key West; the extension of I-10 to Lake City and progress on the extension of I-75 north of Lake City to Tampa; the completion of I-4 from the Tampa/St. Petersburg area across the state to Daytona Beach on the Atlantic; and the beginning of construction of the Everglades Parkway or “Alligator Alley” from Naples on the Gulf coast to Fort Lauderdale north of Miami.

=== Cross Florida Barge Canal ===
Since the territorial days, Florida governors had dreamed of building a canal across the state as a way of improving the economy, expanding settlement, and increasing revenue. Governor Bryant had long supported the construction of what became known as the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Plans called for the canal to cut through the peninsula from Palatka on the St. Johns River to Yankeetown on the Gulf of Mexico. Barges would be able to cross the state from Jacksonville to the Gulf and from the Gulf to the Atlantic. Proponents like Bryant believed that the canal would be a major inducement for investment in the state and a further way to meet the growth demands of Florida&#x27;s burgeoning population. During the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy promised that his presidency would fund construction of the canal. President Kennedy requested money from Congress for initial building costs. After the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, Bryant and other canal supporters argued that the canal would be vital to the defense of the United States; shipping could pass safely through the canal without having to go near Cuba and the threat from Soviet submarines and warplanes. The canal, supporters claimed, would be the perfect highway to safely transport rockets and related material to what would become the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s (NASA) Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral.  In June 1961, the governor testified in Congress about the benefits of the canal, including flood control in an area of the state that had seen massive flood damage over the decades. However, it was not until December 1963, during the first month of the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, that federal money started to flow to the canal project. President Johnson wanted to ensure that he would carry Florida in the 1964 presidential election. He was present with Governor Bryant for the groundbreaking ceremony for the canal at Palatka on February 27, 1964. With this promising beginning, it looked like the canal would be realized. Unfortunately for Bryant, by the end of the 1960s, increased concern about the environmental damage the canal posed to the Ocklawaha River and other waterways and the massive cost of the project led to the eventual demise of the canal. Until the end of his life, Bryant defended the canal and believed the failure to complete it was a great loss to the state.

=== Education ===
One of the biggest impacts of the Bryant administration on the state was in the area of education. Bryant created the Committee on Quality Education in 1961. A year later, he launched the First Governors Conference on Higher Education. Outcomes from the recommendation of these committees, other experts, and the governor&#x27;s own study of the issues, resulted in many changes. In primary education, there was improvement in teacher certification, recruitment of instructors, promotion of vocational training, and the use of libraries and guidance services, among other initiatives. The most consequential educational reforms, however, were in higher education. He received legislative support to increase salaries for university faculty, funded more junior colleges, improved continuing education with the Florida Institute for Continuing University Studies, instituted year-round education in Florida&#x27;s state universities, secured funds for the construction of what would become the University of West Florida in Pensacola, realized the finishing and opening of Florida Atlantic University in 1964, pushed for the creation of the future University of Central Florida, and funded several new buildings for existing Florida universities. Bryant funded this massive educational building program through a bond initiative that would raise the funds necessary for long-term building projects while paying off the bond debt through the state tax on utilities.

=== Promoting Florida ===

Governor Bryant devoted much of his time in office to promoting the virtues of visiting, doing business, and living in Florida. As he did during his campaign for governor in 1960, he used radio and television to promote Florida, especially its citrus industry. As governor-elect in December 1960, he led a delegation to South America to encourage mutual investment and tourism between Florida and that continent. In October 1961, he took his family to Europe to vacation and promote Florida tourism. Bryant, an avid pilot and flyer, flew around the state and country to meet with business and governmental leaders to talk about investing in Florida. The governor increased the number of state parks and promoted historical sites such as San Marcos de Apalache south of Tallahassee. He made sure Florida was represented at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Bryant took pride in the fact that NASA used Cape Canaveral as its launch site for manned space missions and pointed to this development as a sign that Florida was leading the nation into space.

=== The Cold War and Cuba ===

Bryant entered the governorship in January 1961, only two years after Fidel Castro&#x27;s revolutionary forces came to power in Cuba. An ardent opponent of Communism and the Soviet Union since his early days in the legislature, Bryant favored a firm national policy against the Soviet-supported Castro government and pushed to implement civil defense measures in case of war between Soviet Union and the United States. As evidence of Soviet military aid to Cuba grew, Governor Bryant called for the United States to do whatever was necessary to end the Castro regime. A month before the Cuban Missile Crisis, he spoke about his support for a military blockade of Cuba and even an invasion of the island. The governor believed that only the downfall of the Cuban government would end the flow of Cuban refugees to Florida—a situation that he constantly asked the Kennedy administration to relieve. At the same time, he worried about the economic impact the Cuban crisis was having on Florida, especially in south Florida in the days following the Cuban Missile Crisis, when he tried to assure Americans and the world that Florida was safe for tourists. During the missile crisis, he fully backed President Kennedy&#x27;s actions towards Cuba and the Soviet missiles; however, in private, he urged the president to invade Cuba and end the Castro regime. Governor Bryant called out the Florida National Guard, including its air arm, to back up the US military presence in Florida, addressed Floridians about the crisis on the radio, and rushed to strengthen civil defense measures. Bryant remained a Cold warrior after the missile crisis, supporting the Johnson and Nixon policies in Vietnam and endorsing an aggressive stand against Communism wherever it was in power. He supported the requirement that all Florida high school students had to pass a course in Americanism versus Communism before graduation. In 1963, Bryant created the Florida Center for Cold War Education, an institute designed to promote patriotism and to educate Floridians on the threats posed by Communist ideas and countries.

=== Segregation and civil rights ===
As a north central Florida politician from a small town, Farris Bryant grew up in a world where whites and blacks were not supposed to question the dominance of whites in a firmly segregated society. As an ambitious politician with a conservative view of life, Bryant, although he never endorsed violence, never questioned the segregation system in public. He, like almost all Florida lawmakers during his time in the Florida Legislature, opposed the &quot;Brown&quot; decision with its federal call for the integration of the nation&#x27;s schools. After seeing the political price his old rival LeRoy Collins paid for his eventual willingness to implement integration in Florida&#x27;s public schools, Bryant, after losing the governor&#x27;s race in 1956, was determined to uphold segregation when he ran for governor in 1960. He led the effort in the Florida House of Representatives to successfully pass an interposition resolution in opposition to the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. However, after winning the 1960 gubernatorial race, he preferred to downplay the race issue. Bryant allowed the integration of Florida&#x27;s public schools begun under Governor Collins to continue.

When it came to calls for integration and civil rights beyond Florida&#x27;s court ordered integration of public schools, Bryant remained opposed to what he said was a threat to law and order. He did not call for the use of state law enforcement in the bloody repression of civil rights demonstrators as seen in some other southern states, preferring to let local authorities deal with protestors and their racist attackers. In the summer of 1961, Freedom Riders drove across Florida from Pensacola to Jacksonville. Governor Bryant ordered the Florida Highway Patrol to make sure that restaurants, rest stops, and bus terminals along the route did not refuse the riders service. If they did not want to provide service, they were supposed to close, but not protest. There were a couple of violent incidents in Tallahassee, but the Freedom Riders’ journey across Florida was mostly untroubled.

As a result of the St. Augustine movement, in the summer of 1963, African American demonstrators, and allies launched sit-in demonstrations at white owned establishments in St. Augustine, Florida, and marched for civil rights. The violent clashes between whites and the demonstrators were eventually contained and died down but resumed in greater force in the spring of 1964, as the state and city planned events celebrating the city&#x27;s upcoming 400th anniversary of its founding in 1965. Local police arrested demonstrators and white militants attacked marchers and hounded blacks going about their daily business. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. called for massive demonstrations in the city. St. Augustine quickly received national attention as the new battlefield in the civil rights struggle. King arrived in the city to direct and support the demonstrators while a number out of state racists, including the notorious Georgia Klansman J. B. Stoner, came to the scene to encourage the racist attackers. Governor Bryant initially failed to stem the violence. He called in too few state troopers to intervene between the demonstrators and their attackers. When he issued an order to ban nighttime demonstrations, federal judge Bryan Simpson overturned the order and placed the blame for the violence on the white counter-protestors. Governor Bryant called for calm and the establishment of a biracial committee to negotiate an end to the violence. He also sent aides to meet with Reverend King to coordinate actions. Although the violence decreased, the crisis in the city did not end until the Civil Rights Act became law in early July 1964.

=== Methodism and morality ===
Governor Bryant&#x27;s commitment to his Christian faith and Methodism informed his decisions on many issues. He and his wife, Julia, were teetotalers, who forbade the serving of alcohol in the Florida Governor&#x27;s Mansion. He opposed legalized gambling, the elimination of prayer and Bible readings in public schools, and the spread of pornography. And although he supported the death penalty, he anguished over the signing of death warrants, calling the process—ten death row inmates were executed during Bryant&#x27;s term—&#x27;“a soul-searching experience.”&#x27;

== Later life and legacy ==

=== Business and law ===
After leaving office, Farris Bryant and the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where Bryant headed the National Life Insurance Company. Bryant later served as president of the Voyager Group insurance corporation. He made investments in banks and other ventures, including television stations. Bryant also maintained his law practice. In 1970, he became a founding partner in the law firm Bryant Miller Olive.

=== Federal offices ===

In March 1966, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Bryant director of the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP). The agency coordinated disaster relief, managed the nation’s civil defense efforts, and maintained reserves of emergency supplies. As director of OEP, Bryant also served on the National Security Council. Bryant, however, was more than a director of a federal agency. President Johnson saw Bryant as his ambassador to the states’ governors. He headed OEP until October 1967.

While Bryant was serving as director of OEP, President Johnson, in February 1967. appointed him chair of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, an agency designed to coordinate actions and resolve problems between federal, state, and local governments. His term as chair ended in October 1969.

=== 1970 Senate campaign ===
In 1970, Bryant entered the race for the U.S. Senate seat long held by retiring senator Spessard Holland. Bryant&#x27;s years of political experience and his high name recognition made him the candidate to beat in the Florida Democratic primary. Although most of the candidates did not want to talk about it, the hot topic of the day was federally mandated school busing to speed up the integration of the nation’s public schools. Bryant and most of the Democratic candidates opposed busing. He called on the states to take public schools out of the jurisdiction of the courts. Bryant won the first primary but had to face state senator Lawton M. Chiles Jr. in the runoff. Chiles pulled an upset victory and went on to defeat his Republican opponent in the November election. The 1970 race was Bryant&#x27;s last run for political office.

=== Last years ===
Bryant’s wife, Julia, died of cancer on September 8, 1996, at age 78. Recalling her loss in 2000, Bryant said. “She and I were one person. To lose her was hell.” After Julia died, Bryant entered a period of deep depression; however, he managed to find joy during his remaining years by spending time with his daughters, grandchildren, and practicing his Methodist faith. Farris Bryant died in Jacksonville on March 1, 2002, age eighty-seven, after suffering a stroke. He wanted to be remembered as the governor who laid the foundation for the modernization of Florida through the following initiatives: his building program for higher education and expansion of the junior college and university systems; increased transportation infrastructure through the completion of the Florida Turnpike and other highway systems; the promotion of business investment and tourism in Florida; and his embrace and promotion of NASA&#x27;s presence in Florida as proof that the growth and modernization of Florida was vital to the state and the nation. Bryant, however, recognized that his support for segregation during his years in the Florida Legislature and as governor would forever be a part of his place in history. While he came to accept civil rights for African Americans as the right thing for Florida and the country, he maintained that true equality would only come when people changed their own minds about race and learned to accept one another as individuals.

In 2000, Bryant created the Farris and Julia Bryant Florida History Preservation Fund Endowment for the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries to preserve Florida history and culture. Collections digitally and physically preserved include the &quot;Papers of C. Farris Bryant&quot; and the &quot;Florida History and Heritage Collections&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The Age of the Mind&quot; is a 2013 documentary film about Bryant&#x27;s policies and their lasting impact on Florida. Focusing on his years as governor, the documentary highlights many contentious episodes during his administration, including the St. Augustine Civil Rights protests, the construction of the Florida Turnpike and Florida Barge Canal, and the Cuban refugee crisis that resulted from the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

<text>Lone Pine is a series of children&#x27;s books written by English author Malcolm Saville.

Although they were written over a 35-year timespan, between 1943 and 1978, the characters only age by a few years in the course of the series. The earlier books evoke visions of an outdoor 1940s and &#x27;50s childhood reminiscent of Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Famous Five&quot; books, in which children are allowed to have adventures, explore strange places and encounter villains without adult supervision. These &quot;Lone Pine&quot; books were illustrated by Bertram Prance (1889-1958). The later books adjust to the mood of the 1960s and &#x27;70s, as the older characters grow into their late teens and new characters join the Lone Pine Club.

Many of the books are set on or around the Long Mynd and Stiperstones hills in south Shropshire, England, but some are based in Sussex (centred on Rye), Dartmoor, the Goathland and Whitby area of Yorkshire and the Southwold and Walberswick area of the Suffolk coast. One book is set in London, the self-explanatory &quot;Lone Pine London&quot;. The books reflect Saville&#x27;s Christianity and moral values, and the phrase &quot;From Loyalty to Love&quot;, which is the Lone Pine Club&#x27;s motto, is a signifier of his beliefs.

==Characters==
The Lone Pine Club&#x27;s members are: David Morton (Captain), Petronella &quot;Peter&quot; Sterling (Vice Captain), Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; and Mary Morton, Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Ingles, Jenny Harman, Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Warrender, Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Warrender and Harriet Sparrow. Macbeth, or &quot;Mackie&quot;, is the Mortons&#x27; Scottish terrier and is present in all books.

<doc id="1155211" wikidata="Q967537" url="?curid=1155211" title="Eugène de Mazenod">
<text>Eugène de Mazenod, OMI (born Charles-Joseph-Eugène de Mazenod; 1 August 1782 – 21 May 1861) was a French aristocrat and Catholic bishop who founded the congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. 

When he was eight years old, Mazenod&#x27;s family fled the French Revolution and left its considerable wealth behind. As refugees in Italy, they were poor and moved from place to place. He returned to France at the age of twenty and later became a priest. Initially focused on rebuilding the Church in France after the Revolution, his mission soon extended, particularly to British North America. Mazenod was appointed Bishop of Marseille in 1837, and Archbishop in 1851.

Mazenod was beatified on 19 October 1975. He was canonized twenty years later on 3 December 1995. The Catholic Church commemorates him with an optional memorial on 21 May, the anniversary of his death.

Three schools are named for him in Australia in the cities of Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne.

==Biography==
===Refugee===
Eugène de Mazenod was born on 1 August 1782 and baptized the following day in the Église de la Madeleine in Aix-en-Provence. His father, Charles Antoine de Mazenod, was one of the Presidents of the Court of Finances, and his mother was Marie Rose Joannis. Eugène began his schooling at the College Bourbon, but it was interrupted by the events of the French Revolution. With the approach of the French revolutionary forces, the family fled to Italy.

Eugène became a boarder at the College of Nobles in Turin (Piedmont), but a move to Venice meant the end to formal schooling. With their money running out, Eugène&#x27;s father sought various employment, none of which were successful. His mother and sister returned to France and eventually seeking a divorce to be able to regain their seized property. Eugène was fortunate to be welcomed by the Zinelli family in Venice. One of their sons, the priest Bartolo Zinelli, took special care of Eugène and saw to his education in the well-provided family library where the young adolescent spent many hours each day. Don Bartolo was a major influence in the human, academic and spiritual development of Eugène.

Once again the French army chased the émigrés from Venice, forcing Eugène and his father and two uncles to seek refuge in Naples for less than a year, and finally to flee to Palermo in Sicily, where Eugène was invited to become part of the household of the Duke and Duchess of Cannizaro as a companion to their two sons. Being part of the high society of Sicily became the opportunity for Eugène to rediscover his noble origins and to live a lavish style of life. He took to himself the title of &#x27;Comte&#x27; (&quot;Count&quot;) de Mazenod, did all the courtly things, and dreamed of a bright future.

===Conversion===
At the age of twenty, Eugène returned to France and lived with his mother in Aix en Provence. Initially he enjoyed all the pleasures of Aix as a rich young nobleman, intent on the pursuit of pleasure and money, and a rich girl who would bring a good dowry. Gradually he became aware of how empty his life was, and began to search for meaning in more regular church involvement, reading and personal study, and charitable work among prisoners. His journey came to a climax on Good Friday, 1807 when he was 25 years old. Looking at the sight of the Cross, he had a religious experience. He recounted the spiritual experience in his retreat journal: Can I forget the bitter tears that the sight of the cross brought streaming from my eyes one Good Friday? Indeed they welled up from the heart, there was no checking them, they were too abundant for me to be able to hide them from those who like myself were assisting at that moving ceremony. I was in a state of mortal sin and it was precisely this that made me grieve…Blessed, a thousand times blessed, that He, this good Father, notwithstanding my unworthiness, lavished on me all the richness of his mercy.

===Priest===
In 1808, he began his studies for the priesthood at the Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris and was ordained a priest at Amiens (Picardy), on 21 December 1811. Since Napoleon had expelled the Sulpician priests from the seminary, Eugène stayed on as a formator for a semester. As a member of the seminary, notwithstanding personal risk, Eugène committed himself to serve and assist Pope Pius VII, who at this time was a prisoner of Emperor Napoleon I at Fontainebleau. In this way he experienced at firsthand the suffering of the post-Revolutionary Church.

On his return to Aix, Father de Mazenod asked not to be assigned to a parish but to dedicate himself fully to evangelising those who were not being reached by the structures of the local church: the poor who spoke only the Provençal language, prisoners, youth and the inhabitants of poor villages who were ignorant of their faith. The goal of his priestly preaching and ministry was always to lead others to develop themselves fully as humans, then as Christians and finally to become saints.

==Founder==
===Oblates of Mary Immaculate===
On 25 January 1816, &quot;impelled by a strong impulse from outside of himself&quot; he invited other priests to join him in his life of total oblation to God and to the most abandoned of Provence. Initially called &quot;Missionaries of Provence&quot;, they dedicated themselves to evangelisation through preaching parish missions in the poor villages, youth and prison ministry. In 1818, a second community was established at the Marian shrine of Notre Dame du Laus. This became the occasion for the missionaries to become a religious congregation, united through vows and the evangelical counsels. Changing their name to Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the group received papal approbation on 17 February 1826.

===Oblate Missions===
In 1841, Bishop Ignace Bourget of Montreal invited the Oblates to Canada. At the same time, there was an outreach to the British Isles, which was the beginning of a history of missionary outreach to the most abandoned peoples in Canada, the United States, Mexico, England, Ireland, Algeria, Southern Africa and Ceylon during the founder&#x27;s lifetime. In 200 years, the zeal spread and took root in the establishment of the Oblates in nearly 70 countries. 
==Bishop==
Having for some while helped his uncle, , the aged Bishop of Marseilles, in the administration of his diocese, Mazenod was called to Rome and, on 14 October 1832, consecrated titular Bishop of Icosium, which in 1837 he exchanged for that of Bishop of Marseilles, a position he held until his death in 1861. During his episcopacy, he commissioned Notre-Dame de la Garde, an ornate Neo-Byzantine basilica on the south side of the old port of Marseille. He favoured the moral teachings of Alphonsus Liguori, whose theological system he was the first to introduce in France, and whose first biography in French he caused to be written by one of the Oblates.

He inspired local priest Joseph-Marie Timon-David to found the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Marseille in 1852.

Though renowned for being outspoken, he was made a Peer of the French Empire. In 1851 Pope Pius IX gave him the pallium.

== Veneration ==

Some forty-five years after his death, the Diocese of Marseille opened a three-year-long investigation for the cause for Bishop de Mazenod&#x27;s canonization. His spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 22 May 1935 and 14 December 1938. On 15 January 1936, the cause was opened by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and he was given the title Servant of God. In May 1970, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints recognized the heroic virtue of his life, and he was proclaimed &quot;venerable&quot;.

Five years later, after the same congregation attributed miracles of healing to Eugène&#x27;s intercession, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI in Rome on 19 October 1975.

In December 1994, the Congregation for Saints approved another miracle attributed to Blessed Eugène&#x27;s intercession. John Paul II celebrated his Mass of canonization in 1995, on 3 December. In his homily at the Mass, celebrated on the First Sunday of Advent, the Pope proclaimed Saint Eugène a &quot;Man of Advent&quot;, saying:

<doc id="1155214" wikidata="Q7044841" url="?curid=1155214" title="No Protection (Starship album)">
<text>No Protection is the second studio album by American rock band Starship. It was released on July 6, 1987, by Grunt Records and RCA Records. The album featured the number-one single &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;, and the top-10 single &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over (&#x27;Til It&#x27;s Over)&quot;, the former of which appears in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Mannequin&quot; and the latter of which was a tune originally performed the previous year by one-time Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band frontman Chris Thompson for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;. Third single &quot;Beat Patrol&quot; was #46 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100.

This was the last album which was released through Grunt Records, and the final Starship album to feature vocalist Grace Slick, who left the band in 1988 and rejoined Jefferson Airplane for their reunion tour and self-titled reunion album, &quot;Jefferson Airplane&quot;, in 1989. The Diane Warren-penned ballad &quot;Set the Night to Music&quot; was covered in 1991 as a duet between R&amp;B singer Roberta Flack and reggae singer Maxi Priest, released as a single from Flack&#x27;s album &quot;Set the Night to Music&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the single &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over (&#x27;Til It&#x27;s Over)&quot; is &quot;a soaring, anthemic rocker with a winning chorus.&quot;

<doc id="1155218" wikidata="Q454603" url="?curid=1155218" title="Jodocus Hondius">
<text>Jodocus Hondius (Latinized version of his Dutch name: &quot;Joost de Hondt&quot;) (17 October 1563 – 12 February 1612) was a Flemish and Dutch engraver and cartographer. He is sometimes called Jodocus Hondius the Elder to distinguish him from his son Jodocus Hondius II. Hondius is best known for his early maps of the New World and Europe, for re-establishing the reputation of the work of Gerard Mercator, and for his portraits of Francis Drake. He inherited and republished the plates of Mercator, thus reviving his legacy, also making sure to include independent revisions to his work. One of the notable figures in the Golden Age of Dutch cartography (c. 1570s–1670s), he helped establish Amsterdam as the center of cartography in Europe in the 17th century.

==Biography==
Hondius was born in Wakken and grew up in Ghent. In his early years he established himself as an engraver, instrument maker and globe maker. In 1584 he moved to London with his sister Jacomina to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. In 1587 in London he married Colette van den Keere (sometimes known as Colette Hondius), daughter of Hendrik, an engraver of metal type, and collaborated with her brother Pieter, also a mapmaker and engraver.
While in England, Hondius was instrumental in publicizing the work of Francis Drake, who had made a circumnavigation of the world in the late 1570s. In particular, in 1589 Hondius produced a now famous map of the bay of New Albion, where Drake briefly established a settlement on the west coast of North America at Drake&#x27;s Cove, California. Hondius is also thought to be the artist of several well-known portraits of Drake that are now in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Also Hondius had engraved charts in the Mariners Mirrour (1588) and the gores for the first English globes, those of Emery Molyneux completed in 1592.

In 1593, accompanied by his wife and Pieter van der Keere, he moved to Amsterdam where he remained until the end of his life. In co-operation with the Amsterdam publisher Cornelis Claesz in 1604 he purchased the plates of Gerard Mercator&#x27;s &quot;Atlas&quot; from Mercator&#x27;s grandson. Mercator&#x27;s work had languished in comparison to the rival &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; by Ortelius. Hondius republished Mercator&#x27;s work with 36 additional maps (which were added to 107 original maps), including several which he himself had produced. Despite the addition of his own contributions, Hondius gave Mercator full credit as the author of the work, listing himself as the publisher. Hondius&#x27;s new edition of Mercator&#x27;s work was a great success, selling out after a year. Hondius later published a second edition, as well as a pocket version &quot;Atlas Minor&quot;. The maps have since become known as the &quot;Mercator/Hondius series&quot;. Hondius was a cousin of Abraham Goos, and he taught Goos mapmaking and engraving.

In the French edition of the &quot;Atlas Minor&quot; we find one of the first instances of a thematic map using map symbols. This is a map entitled &quot;Designatio orbis christiani&quot; (1607) showing the dispersion of major religions.

Hondius used copper plates to print John Speed&#x27;s atlas &quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot;, which was published in 1611/2.

Hondius died, aged 48 (1612), in Amsterdam. After his death, his publishing work in Amsterdam was continued by his widow, two sons, Jodocus II and Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius, whose name appears on the &quot;Atlas&quot; as co-publisher after 1633. Eventually, starting with the first 1606 edition in Latin, about 50 editions of the &quot;Atlas&quot; were released in the main European languages. In the Islamic world, the atlas was partially translated by the Turkish scholar Kâtip Çelebi. The series is sometimes called the &quot;Mercator/Hondius/Janssonius&quot; series because of Janssonius&#x27;s later contributions.

==Portrayal of globes in Vermeer&#x27;s paintings==
Scholars have argued that the globes depicted in celebrated 17th-century painter Johannes Vermeer&#x27;s 1668 &quot;The Astronomer&quot; and 1669 &quot;The Geographer&quot; were based on a pair of globes by Hondius. Close inspection of these two globes reveals striking similarities to a pair of globes made in 1618 by Hondius. The globes were made as pendants, one depicting the earth while the other depicted the constellations. In Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;The Astronomer&quot; the scholar consults a version of Hondius&#x27; celestial globe and in &quot;The Geographer&quot; Hondius&#x27; terrestrial globe can be seen placed atop the back cabinet. A version of Hondius&#x27; celestial globe can be found in the Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam and the terrestrial globe can be found in the Hispanic Society Museum &amp; Library in New York City.

<doc id="1155223" wikidata="Q2632551" url="?curid=1155223" title="Roland Huntford">
<text>Roland Huntford ( Horwitch; born 1927) is an author, principally of biographies of Polar explorers.

==Background and education==
Huntford, the son of Lithuanian parents (originally &quot;Horowitz&quot;) living in South Africa, has stated that he was educated at the University of Cape Town and Imperial College London. In an interview with the glaciologist Charles Swithinbank, he claimed &quot;his father was an Army officer and his mother was from Russia&quot;; Ranulph Fiennes, however, observed that, during his own research on Captain Scott – in the course of which he presented reviews of, and himself assessed, Huntford&#x27;s biographical work – he was unable to corroborate any of Huntford&#x27;s own claims regarding his background, which presented his father as &quot;some English colonial gentleman given to romantic travels in pre-Soviet Russia&quot;.

==Career==
Huntford&#x27;s author biography, used in publicity for his books, states that he worked for the United Nations in Geneva, then as a journalist for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He was formerly Scandinavian correspondent of &quot;The Observer&quot;, also acting as their winter sports correspondent. He was the 1986–1987 Alistair Horne Fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

He has written biographies of Robert Falcon Scott, Ernest Shackleton and Nobel Peace Prize winner Fridtjof Nansen; these biographies have been the subject of controversy. 

Huntford put forth the point of view that Roald Amundsen&#x27;s success in reaching the South Pole was abetted by much superior planning, whereas errors by Scott (notably including the reliance on horses instead of sled dogs) ultimately resulted in the death of Scott and his companions.

Huntford&#x27;s other books include &quot;Sea of Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Sayings of Henrik Ibsen&quot; and &quot;Two Planks and a Passion: The dramatic history of skiing&quot;. His polemical &quot;The New Totalitarians&quot; is a critique of socialism in Sweden, written from the point of view of western political culture. His main thesis was that the Swedish social democratic party, like the &quot;new totalitarians&quot; in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, relied less upon the violence and intimidation of the old totalitarians than upon sly persuasion and soft manipulation in order to achieve its goals.

<text>The Burrokeet (alternative spellings: Burroquite, borokit, borokite, bourriquite) is a &quot;donkey-man&quot; character traditionally portrayed in Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. The name derives from the Spanish word &quot;burroquito&quot; (little donkey), the character&#x27;s costume being constructed so as to give the illusion of a dancer riding a small burro or donkey. This masquerade was brought to Trinidad by Venezuelan settlers.

The burrokeet costume is a well-decorated donkey&#x27;s head made from coloured paper and attached to a bamboo frame. The masquerader enters through a hole at the back of the &quot;donkey&quot;&#x27;s neck and carries the reins in his hands, with the animal&#x27;s body fitted around his hips, thereby creating the illusion of being the donkey&#x27;s rider. The donkey&#x27;s body is covered in a long satin skirt and has a sisal rope tail, sometimes decorated with flowers. The bit and bridle are made of coloured cord. The &quot;rider&quot; wears a satin shirt and a large matador straw hat and dances in a way that mimics the antics of a donkey, making it caper and bow. A dance called Burriquite with origins in Venezuela is also performed.

==Sou-Marie==

The burrokeet masquerade, associated with the South American mainland and Venezuelan Spaniards, has become linked with the &quot;Sou-Marie&quot; character that derives from East Indian culture brought to Trinidad by indentured labourers. The Sou-Marie (or Sumari / Soomaree) mas, performed to tassa drum music and today only seen rarely in the rural areas, features what is called the &quot;harrichand&quot; dance: &quot;The costume consists of an ornately decorated bamboo frame in the shape of a horse with a hole in the &#x27;horse′s&#x27; back. The masquerader enters this hole and is attached to the frame by a series of straps. He holds the reins of &#x27;the hose&#x27; and dances. He moves the &#x27;horse&#x27; forward and backward to give the illusion of riding on horseback. Drums and singing in Hindi usually accompany the dancing.&quot; In the Tamil Nadu (Madras) state of South India, this dance is known as &quot;Poikkal Kuthirai Aattam&quot;.

<text>Harry Keith Burkinshaw (born 23 June 1935) is an English former professional footballer and football manager. He is one of the most successful managers of Tottenham Hotspur, winning three major trophies for the club as manager there.

==Playing career==
Burkinshaw was born in Higham, Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire. He passed his 11-plus and attended Barnsley grammar school, being in the same school year as Michael Parkinson. He obtained six O-levels and after leaving school, he began his footballing career with Midland League side Denaby United while working at Dodworth Colliery. He had a brief spell as an amateur with Wolverhampton Wanderers before joining Liverpool in November 1953. He spent a period in the British Army, serving alongside Duncan Edwards in Wales.

Burkinshaw played just once for Liverpool, against Port Vale in April 1955, moving to Workington in December 1957 for a fee of £3,000. He was player-manager of Workington between November 1964 and March 1965, leaving to join Scunthorpe United in May 1965, having played 293 league games for Workington. He played a further 108 league games for Scunthorpe, and had a short spell as caretaker manager before retiring from playing in May 1968.

==Coaching and managerial career==
Shortly after announcing his retirement, Burkinshaw moved to Zambia where he coached for a few months before returning to England as first team coach of Newcastle United. He was sacked by Newcastle on 1 May 1975 and joined Tottenham Hotspur as coach a month later. He became manager after Terry Neill left as manager for Arsenal in 1976. He was manager from 14 July 1976 to 31 May 1984, and he won more major competitions at the club than all but one other Spurs manager (that being Bill Nicholson). Spurs were relegated in Burkinshaw&#x27;s first year in charge but bounced straight back for promotion the following year. He signed two Argentine World Cup stars, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, in 1978. It was considered a brave move but Ardiles would become one of the Spurs greats and Villa would score one of the greatest goals ever seen at Wembley in the 1981 FA Cup Final replay. Burkinshaw&#x27;s Spurs, with Ardiles, Villa and Glenn Hoddle, won two successive FA Cups.

In his final game in charge, Spurs won the UEFA Cup for a second time after a penalty shoot-out after the second leg at White Hart Lane. In doing so, they beat an Anderlecht team that included the future Spurs Sporting Director Frank Arnesen. On leaving White Hart Lane for the last time, brought about by a disagreement with the board, he was said to have remarked: &quot;There used to be a football club over there&quot; (actually a misattribution – it was written by journalist Ken Jones who mentioned to Burkinshaw as he was leaving the club the Frank Sinatra&#x27;s song &quot;There Used to Be a Ballpark&quot;, said to be about the demolition of Ebbets Field, and Burkinshaw nodded in agreement.)

In June 1984 he was appointed as coach to the Bahrain national side. He left that role in July 1986. Burkinshaw later managed Sporting Clube de Portugal until he was sacked in February 1988. In October 1988 he returned to England as manager of Gillingham, but resigned in April 1989 with the team on the verge of relegation to Division Four.

Burkinshaw took charge of big-spending Malaysian state team Pahang between late April and July 1991, leading them to the top of the league table before departing for Swindon Town.

Burkinshaw was later Chief Scout for Glenn Hoddle and Ossie Ardiles at Swindon Town and in May 1992 became assistant to Ardiles at West Bromwich Albion. When Ardiles moved to manage Tottenham in the summer of 1993, Burkinshaw was promoted to Albion manager. His career as Albion manager lasted just one season (1993–94) and he was sacked after they narrowly avoided relegation back to Division Two.

He was later Director of Football at Aberdeen before briefly taking charge as caretaker-manager at Pittodrie when Roy Aitken was sacked in 1997, he left when Alex Miller was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager.

In March 2005 Burkinshaw was appointed assistant manager at Watford. He left this position in December 2007 due to a serious family illness, having helped the club reach promotion to the Premier League in 2006.

<doc id="1155237" wikidata="Q7504283" url="?curid=1155237" title="Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway">
<text>The Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway was a railway running from Shrewsbury, England to Llanymynech, Wales, with a branch to Criggion. It was promoted by Holman Fred Stephens, better known as Colonel Stephens, proprietor of several ultra-low budget light railways. It adopted the track network of the defunct Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway that had closed in 1880; the S&amp;MLR opened in 1911. Running through sparsely inhabited terrain, it struggled to achieve financial stability, and following a serious deterioration of maintenance conditions, it closed to passengers in 1933, continuing with a basic goods and mineral service.

During World War II, the line was taken over by the War Department in 1941, and extensively reconstructed to serve Central Ammunition Depot Nesscliffe. It was finally closed in 1960.

==First railway==

Richard Samuel France was the proprietor of important limestone quarries at Nantmawr and elsewhere in Powys, then Montgomeryshire. He needed to get the quarry output to a railway terminal for onward transit, and he promoted a railway to achieve this. The idea developed and became a public concern, the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway. The title indicated the far-reaching ambitions of the company, but in fact it only stretched from Shrewsbury to Llanymynech, Nantmawr and Criggion, a network of 28 miles. The line opened in 1866. It was informally known as the Potts Line.

The line never attracted enough business to make a profit, and basic maintenance was cut back due to the lack of cash. The system became dangerous and was closed down in 1880 on safety grounds. An attempt at financial reconstruction was made in 1888, and a new company titled &quot;The Shropshire Railways&quot; was created. Shareholders in the Potts Company transferred their holding into the Shropshire Company, and it took possession of the dormant assets on 19 September 1890, but it too failed to achieve anything; an official receiver was appointed in 1891, and no further railway activity took place.

==Revival: Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway==
The Potts network other than the Nantmawr branch had been dormant since 1880. In 1907 Holman Fred Stephens, later Colonel Stephens, already had several light railways in his control. All of them were only marginally profitable, and that by the most stringent economy. Stephens decided that the Potteries Line could be revived as a light railway. He obtained the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway Order 1909 on 17 January 1908, authorising the operation of all the Shropshire Railways system except the Nantmawr branch as a light railway. The new company was to be called the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Light Railway. Several local authorities (the county and some rural district councils) made 40-year loans. The Shropshire Railways company continued in existence as owner of the land.

The formal re-opening of the line took place on 13 April 1911, this time with invited guests. Opening to the general public took place the following day.
In the first six months of operation, an operating profit of £404 was made, but after payment of debenture holders a net surplus of less than £1 remained.

The Criggion branch opened for goods and mineral traffic on 21 February 1912, and for passengers in August 1912.

==Decline==

In the early 1920s Stephens introduced two back to back railcar sets, a Ford pair and a Wolseley-Siddeley pair, reducing costs considerably. However they were not successful, and they were withdrawn after a short period in service.

Passenger operation beyond Melverley ceased in October 1932, due to the unsafe state of the bridge over the River Severn. As there was no run-round facility at Melverley, now a terminus, the train from Kinnerley propelled a single coach on the outward trip. 

All passenger operation, except for occasional excursions, was discontinued on 6 November 1933. The Criggion quarry train ran weekly, and occasional ordinary goods traffic served the intermediate stations.

It appears that the Shropshire Railways Company continued in existence as owner of the former Potts system, suggesting that the S&amp;MLR was a tenant. The Shropshire Railways received the rental for the Nantmawr branch from the Cambrian Railways, and later from the Great Western Railway. Neither the Shropshire Railways nor the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway were subject to the &quot;Grouping&quot; process in 1923 (following the Railways Act 1921).

==Military use==
In 1941, the entire line except the Criggion branch was requisitioned by the War Department and established as an ammunition store. Extensive track renewal took place. Army steam engines were brought in to service numerous storage depots that were set up. A new exchange location with the main line was established at Hookagate.

From 1 June 1941, the War Department operated all trains on the line, military and civilian.

However the Criggion branch remained outside the scope of War Department control; there was a daily train conveying granite from the Breidden quarries. In 1945 Melverley viaduct showed obvious signs of weakness and imminent collapse. At first the wagons were pushed up to and over the bridge by the quarry company&#x27;s vertical-boilered Sentinel locomotive, to be collected on the Kinnerley side by the S&amp;MLR engine. Later the Sentinel engine was allowed to cross the bridge at walking pace and take the train all the way to Kinnerley.

In 1947, the line was returned to civilian status, and the company was nationalised in 1948. The War Department usage continued, until in 1959 that came to an end, and in December 1959 the Criggion stone traffic ceased to operate as well. The final scheduled train ran on 26 February 1960 and on 29 February the line was closed. Abbey goods yard at Shrewsbury was retained.

The Nantmawr branch too continued as part of British Railways, served from Oswestry via Blodwell Junction.

<doc id="1155244" wikidata="Q756990" url="?curid=1155244" title="Uraeus">
<text>The Uraeus () or Ouraeus (Ancient Greek: , ; Egyptian: &quot;&quot;, &quot;rearing cobra&quot;, plural: &quot;Uraei&quot;) is the stylized, upright form of an Egyptian cobra, used as a symbol of sovereignty, royalty, deity and divine authority in ancient Egypt.

==Symbolism==

The Uraeus is a symbol for the goddess Wadjet. She was one of the earliest Egyptian deities and was often depicted as a cobra, as she is the serpent goddess. The center of her cult was in Per-Wadjet, later called Buto by the Greeks. She became the patroness of the Nile Delta and the protector of all of Lower Egypt. The pharaohs wore the uraeus as a head ornament: either with the body of Wadjet atop the head, or as a crown encircling the head; this indicated Wadjet&#x27;s protection and reinforced the pharaoh&#x27;s claim over the land. In whatever manner that the Uraeus was displayed upon the pharaoh&#x27;s head, it was, in effect, part of the pharaoh&#x27;s crown. The pharaoh was recognized only by wearing the Uraeus, which conveyed legitimacy to the ruler. There is evidence for this tradition even in the Old Kingdom during the third millennium BCE. Several goddesses associated with or being considered aspects of Wadjet are depicted wearing the uraeus as well.

At the time of the unification of Egypt, the image of Nekhbet, the goddess who was represented as a white vulture and held the same position as the patron of Upper Egypt, joined the image of Wadjet on the Uraeus that would encircle the crown of the pharaohs who ruled the unified Egypt. The importance of their separate cults kept them from becoming merged as with so many Egyptian deities. Together, they were known as the Nebty or the Two Ladies, who became the joint protectors and patrons of the unified Egypt.

Later, the pharaohs were seen as a manifestation of the sun god Ra, and so it also was believed that the Uraeus protected them by spitting fire on their enemies from the fiery eye of the goddess. In some mythological works, the eyes of Ra are said to be uraei.

==Golden Uraeus of Senusret II==

In 1919, after only a half-hour of excavation, the Qufti worker Hosni Ibrahim held in his hands the solid-gold &quot;Golden Uraeus of Senusret II&quot;. It had been decided to make a (follow-up) &quot;complete clearance&quot; of the El-Lahun Pyramid&#x27;s rooms at Saqqara. The start in the rock-cut offering chamber, leading from the tomb, on the south, immediately revealed in the turnover of the six inches of debris, the Golden Uraeus crown ornament.

Before Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb was found in 1922, this Golden Uraeus was the only ornament ever known to be worn by an entombed pharaoh, and it was thought that it was passed to the next pharaoh.

The Golden Uraeus is of solid gold, , black eyes of granite, a snake head of deep ultramarine lapis lazuli, the flared cobra hood of dark carnelian inlays, and inlays of turquoise. To mount it on the pharaoh&#x27;s crown, two loops in the rear-supporting tail of the cobra provide the attachment points.

==As a hieroglyph==

Besides the Uraeus being used as an ornament for statuary or as an adornment on the pharaoh, it also was used for jewellery and in amulets. However, another important use is as the hieroglyph.

For &quot;Uraeus&quot; ornament as a mummy grave example, &quot;See:&quot; Djedptahiufankh, High Priest of 21st Dynasty, Shoshenq I.
The simplest hieroglyph is the &quot;Cobra&quot; (the Uraeus); however there are subcategories, referring to: a goddess, a priestess, the goddess Menhit, the shrine of the goddess (àter), the goddess Isis, and lastly &quot;goddess: (Cobra (Uraeus) at base of deity (ntr))&quot;.

The Rosetta Stone uses the plural of the last example, &quot;3 × &quot;god flag&quot; with Cobra at each base of flag&quot;. The story of the Rosetta Stone has the king (the priests of the king) listing his reasons for being honored, and in return, &quot;The Gods and Goddesses (plural)&quot; reward him. The last two-thirds of the Rosetta Stone relates how he will be honored, including erecting the Rosetta Stone, for all to read.
Another example of the hieroglyph usage is as adornments upon the hieroglyph for &quot;shrine&quot;, and also for &quot;buildings&quot;.

==The Blue Crown==
Before the New Kingdom Period, the body of the Uraeus coiled around in circles behind its raised head on the Blue Crown. The king is most often depicted wearing the Blue Crown in combat and the aftermath of combat scenes. Additionally, the smaller scale king usually wore the Blue Crown when depicted in a protective group of deities. Colossal statues of the king wearing a Blue Crown are extremely rare; the typical royal statue also does not feature a Blue Crown. Also, depictions of the Blue Crown with its Uraeus does not decorate royal tombs until late in the Ramesside Period. The deity-on-earth king was thought to require extra protection in his mortal form, emphasizing the protective qualities of the Uraeus. The Uraeus was usually crafted from precious metals, most commonly gold and less frequently silver, and adorned with gemstones. 

==Seraphim==
The angelic seraphim, found in the Hebrew Bible and later Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, are frequently associated with serpents and are thought to have derived from the concept of uraeus. Multiple-winged uraei amulets are well represented in the land of Israel.

<doc id="1155271" wikidata="Q7567420" url="?curid=1155271" title="South Hampton Roads">
<text>South Hampton Roads is a region located in the extreme southeastern portion of Virginia&#x27;s Tidewater region in the United States with a total population of 1,177,742 as of 2020. It is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area), which itself has a population of 1,780,059 as of 2020.

Hampton Roads is the common name for the metropolitan area that surrounds the body of water of the same name. The land portion of Hampton Roads has been historically divided into two regions, South Hampton Roads on the south side and the Virginia Peninsula on the north side. (Locally, South Hampton Roads is commonly called &quot;the Southside&quot;, which is not to be confused with &quot;Southside Virginia&quot;, which is a separate region of the south-central portion of Virginia located farther inland.)

As of the 2020 census, the Hampton Roads MSA is the ninth largest metropolitan area by size in the southeastern United States, and is the second-largest (after the Charlotte metro area) between Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, Georgia.

==U.S. military installations==

South Hampton Roads is home to several United States military bases.

===City of Portsmouth===
Norfolk Naval Shipyard is located in Portsmouth, as are the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, two historic and important facilities, as well as several smaller facilities. The shipyard was founded as the Gosport Shipyard on November 1, 1767, and has the country&#x27;s first dry dock. The name was changed after the American Civil War. (Although it is located in Portsmouth, the name Norfolk was chosen to avoid confusion with another U.S. Navy shipyard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire which is about 50 miles (80 km) north of Boston, Massachusetts, at the southernmost tip of Maine.)

===City of Norfolk===
Across the Elizabeth River, at Sewell&#x27;s Point near the mouth of Hampton Roads is the Norfolk Navy Base, the central hub of the United States Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet. The base was founded in 1917, and is now the largest naval facility in the world.

===City of Virginia Beach===
Virginia Beach is home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Air Station Oceana (NAS Oceana) and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek (NAB Little Creek). NAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach, and both bases there, like the Norfolk Navy Base, are considered to be the largest of their respective kinds in the world. Furthermore, adjacent to Oceana is NAVSEA Dam Neck. Virginia Beach is also the home of Joint Expeditionary Base East, operated by the United States Navy, which is located at Cape Henry.

===City of Chesapeake===
St. Julien&#x27;s Creek Annex is a U.S. Navy facility in Chesapeake on the Southern Branch Elizabeth River. It began operations in 1849 and occupies approximately , including of land, of marsh, and of surface water. It is currently considered part of the Norfolk Navy Base.

Chesapeake is also home to U.S. Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress, an auxiliary landing facility for NAS Oceana.

The decision to call the region &quot;Hampton Roads&quot; was a political one. The area was referred to as &quot;Tidewater&quot; for many years by the local residents. The local baseball team was called the Tidewater Tides for years but is now called the Norfolk Tides. When they first came to Tidewater, they adopted the local name to draw more fans.

==Local government==
In Colonial times, and even in the first 150 years of the United States, much like Virginia as a whole, South Hampton Roads was in an almost constant state of change in terms of local government, largely due to growth, as counties were divided and towns were formed as the population grew. Some towns grew to become cities. Under the state constitutional changes in 1871, extant and future cities in Virginia became independent cities of the counties they had formerly been located within.

However, in the second half of the 20th century, an unprecedented wave of city-county-town local government consolidations took place in South Hampton Roads and on the Virginia Peninsula. Nowhere else in Virginia have rural areas and more dense cities been combined in such a manner as these two areas. The changes resulted in the area having Virginia&#x27;s cities with the largest land areas and the most farming, even over 30 years after the consolidations in some instances.

===Current cities, counties and towns===
The South Hampton Roads region includes five independent cities, three counties, and three incorporated towns with a total population of 1,191,937 people. There were also a number of political subdivisions which are now extinct, primarily due to growth and consolidation of local government (see section below).

===Independent cities===
*Chesapeake (formerly Norfolk County)
*Norfolk
*Portsmouth
*Suffolk (formerly Nansemond County)
*Virginia Beach (formerly Princess Anne County)

===Counties===
*Currituck County, NC
*Gates County, NC
*Isle of Wight County

===Incorporated towns===

*Gatesville, NC
*Smithfield
*Windsor

===Extinct political subdivisions===
Exclusive of towns which became cities and still have the same name, no less than 2 shires, 6 counties, 1 town, and 2 entire cities no longer exist in the South Hampton Roads area. For search of genealogical, land, and other historical records, it may be necessary to find these old names.

The following is a listing of these 11 extinct shire, counties, towns, and cities, with the approximate dates they existed: 
*Elizabeth River Shire (1634–1636) and Elizabeth City County (1636–1952)
*Warrosquyoake Shire (1634–1637)
*New Norfolk County (1636–1637)
*Upper Norfolk County (1637–1646)
*Lower Norfolk County (1637–1691)
*Nansemond County (1646–1972)
*Norfolk County (1691–1963)
*Princess Anne County (1691–1963)
*Town of Berkley (unknown-1906)
*South Norfolk (1919–1963)
*City of Nansemond (1972–1974)

==Highways, bridges, tunnels, bridge-tunnels==
Generally surrounded by water, the South Hampton Roads region is accessed from the north by a network of highways, bridges, tunnels and bridge-tunnels across the James and Elizabeth Rivers, the harbor of Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay. The area is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the State of North Carolina, and on the west by several counties which are considered to be in the Southside Virginia region.

<doc id="1155292" wikidata="Q5192185" url="?curid=1155292" title="Cubberley Community Center">
<text>Cubberley Community Center known locally as &quot;Cubberley&quot;, is a community center in Palo Alto, California, that has been in operation since 1990. It is housed on the campus of the former Ellwood P. Cubberley High School. Space is available for rent by the hour, either one-time or on a regular basis for community related meetings, seminars, social events, dances, theatre performances, music rehearsals and athletic events.

== History ==
The Ellwood P. Cubberley High School opened in the Fall of 1956 and closed in 1979, as a result of budget cuts from California Proposition 13 (1978). Cubberley High School is perhaps best known as the setting of Ron Jones&#x27; 1967 social experiment The Third Wave, helping to teach Fascism. The high school was named after Ellwood P. Cubberley, an influential authority in the development of institutionalized education.

The 35-acre property belongs to the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD), and is leased to the City of Palo Alto. The larger remainder of this site, (approx. 39,000 square feet) was leased since 2002 to the Foothill-De Anza College District for the Middlefield Campus of Foothill College, a local community college. However, in 2016 this campus moved to Sunnyvale and with the loss of Foothill College as a tenent, this opened up more rentable space for other community-based organizations.

The site boasts a track, a grassy school &quot;amphitheater,&quot; and a gym, now used as sites for public running, recreation, and community athletics respectively.

Cubberley Community Center has been home to local interest organizations including; a ballroom dancing club, child care services, senior center, wildlife rescue organization, Palo Alto Vineyard Church, a Chinese reading room, kung fu classes, karate lessons, private artist studios, L’Ecole de Danse, the Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra and many more.
The Friends of the Palo Alto Library holds used book sales at Cubberley on the second Saturday of every month and the following Sunday, at three locations on campus.
The Cubberley Community Center once hosted rock shows by local bands and touring artists including Buffalo Springfield, Santana, William Penn and His Pals, Cake, Third Eye Blind, blink-182, Daniel Tsai Band, and Frank Black.

<doc id="1155299" wikidata="Q184711" url="?curid=1155299" title="Sister city">
<text>A sister city or a twin town relationship is a form of legal or social agreement between two geographically and politically distinct localities for the purpose of promoting cultural and commercial ties.

While there are early examples of international links between municipalities akin to what are known as sister cities or twin towns today dating back to the 9th century, the modern concept was first established and adopted worldwide during World War II.

==Origins of the modern concept==
Throughout history, many cities have participated in various cultural exchanges and similar activities that might resemble a sister-city or twin-city relationship, but the first officially documented case of such a relationship was a signed agreement between the leaders of the cities of Toledo, Ohio and Toledo, Spain in 1931. However, the modern concept of town twinning appeared during the Second World War. More specifically, it was inspired by the bombing of Coventry on 14 November 1940, known as the Coventry Blitz. First conceived by the then Mayor of Coventry, Alfred Robert Grindlay, culminating in his renowned telegram to the people of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in 1942, the idea emerged as a way of establishing solidarity links between cities in allied countries that went through similar devastating events.

The comradeship between the two cities continued, when again in response to the Battle of Stalingrad, 830 women in Coventry – led by the subsequent Mayor Emily Smith – had their names embroidered on a tablecloth along with the words &quot;Little help is better than a lot of pity&quot; and sent it, along with money (each donated six pence), to the people of Stalingrad. The tablecloth can now be seen at the Panorama Museum of the Battle of Stalingrad.

The twinning between Coventry and Stalingrad was formalized in 1944 and, after the end of the war, similar links were established to foster friendship and understanding among former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation, with new twinnings between Coventry and German cities: Kiel as early as in 1947 and Dresden in 1956. In 1957, Coventry was officially twinned with Belgrade, even though the link actually dates back to 1953 when then Yugoslav Ambassador visited Coventry and offered a gift of timber from his native country for use in the new Civic Theatre, which when finished was named Belgrade Theatre.

The purpose of twinnings was then expanded to encourage trade and tourism or to reflect other links, such as towns sharing the same name or migration links. By the 2000s, town twinning became increasingly used to form strategic international business links among member cities, and may include localities of any scope such as villages, prefectures, or countries.

== Terminology ==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;twin towns&quot; is most commonly used; the term &quot;sister cities&quot; is generally used for agreements with towns and cities in the Americas. In mainland Europe, the most commonly used terms are &quot;twin towns&quot;, &quot;partnership towns&quot;, &quot;partner towns&quot;, and &quot;friendship towns&quot;. The European Commission uses the term &quot;twinned towns&quot; and refers to the process as &quot;town twinning&quot;. Spain uses the term &quot;ciudades hermanadas&quot;, which means &quot;sister cities&quot;. Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic each use (German), (Polish) and (Czech), which translate as &quot;partner town&quot; or &quot;partner city&quot;. France uses (jumelage, twinned town or city), and Italy has (twinning) and (twinned municipality). In the Netherlands, the term is , or (&quot;city bond&quot; when providing mutual support). In Greece, the word (fraternisation) has been adopted. In Iceland, the terms (friend towns) and (friend cities) are used. In the former Soviet Bloc, &quot;twin towns&quot; and &quot;twin cities&quot; were used, and in Russian, they use (sworn brother cities).

The Americas, South Asia, and Australasia use the term &quot;sister cities&quot; or &quot;twin cities&quot;. In China, the term is 友好城市 (yǒuhǎo chéngshìfriendly cities). Sometimes, other government bodies enter into a twinning relationship, such as the agreement between the provinces of Hainan in China and Jeju in South Korea. The Douzelage is a town twinning association with one town from each of the member states of the European Union.

Though the term is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;friendship city&quot;, this may mean a relationship with a more limited scope in comparison to a sister city relationship, and friendship city relationships are mayor-to-mayor agreements.

===City diplomacy===

City diplomacy is a form of paradiplomacy that involves discussions between officials and residents of different cities. Often these cities will be located in different countries. As such, city diplomacy involves a sort of international relations that works in parallel to the conventional system involving embassies, ambassadors, and treaties negotiated at the level of nation states. According to Rodrigo Tavares, the earliest formal attempts to establish city diplomacy across national boundaries took place in the 19th century. Only a handful of cities were involved in the 19th-century efforts; it was not until the turn of the millennium that it became much more common. The first priority of those carrying out city diplomacy typically overlaps with the core aims of municipal government – improving the lives of local residents. Yet they will often collaborate with peers in other cities to work on issues of planet-wide concern, such as efforts to address climate change.

The phrase &quot;city diplomacy&quot; is formally used in the workings of the United Cities and Local Governments and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, and is recognised by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. A March 2014 debate in the British House of Lords acknowledged the evolution of town twinning into city diplomacy, particularly in matters of trade and tourism, but also in culture and post-conflict reconciliation. The importance of cities developing &quot;their own foreign economic policies on trade, foreign investment, tourism and attracting foreign talent&quot; has also been highlighted by the World Economic Forum. In addition to C40, other organisations facilitating city diplomacy include the World Cities Summit, City Mayors Foundation, the &quot;Smart City Expo World Congress&quot;, the &quot;Strong City Network&quot; and &quot;100 Resilient Cities.&quot; As of 2016, there were over 125 such multilateral networks and forums to facilitate international collaboration between different municipal authorities. A Bill introduced in the 2019 session of the US Congress would have legislated for a City and State Diplomacy Act to create a new Office of Subnational Diplomacy at the Department of State.H.R.3571 - 116th Congress (2019-2020): City and State Diplomacy Act.

Recently, the field of city diplomacy has taken a step beyond city-to-city exchanges to target the facilitation of dialogue between cities and multilateral organs, such as the United Nations.

=== Twinning beyond cities and towns ===
Not only cities and towns, but also provinces, states, territories, and regions enter into twinning agreements. For example, the Canadian province of Alberta has &quot;sister province&quot; agreements with Gangwon, South Korea (since 1974), Hokkaido, Japan (since 1980), Heilongjiang, China (1981), Jalisco, Mexico (1999), Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine (2004), Lviv, Ukraine (2005), Guangdong, China (2017), and California, United States (2018), as well as policy-oriented (as opposed to economic and cultural) agreements with Nevada, United States (since 2013), Missouri, United States (2015), and Texas, United States (2018).

==Europe==

The earliest known town twinning in Europe was between Paderborn, Germany, and Le Mans, France, in 836. Starting in 1905, Keighley in West Yorkshire, England, had a twinning arrangement with French communities Suresnes and Puteaux. The first recorded modern twinning agreement was between Keighley and Poix-du-Nord in Nord, France, in 1920 following the end of the World War I. This was initially referred to as an adoption of the French town; formal twinning charters were not exchanged until 1986.

The practice was continued after the Second World War as a way to promote mutual understanding and cross-border projects of mutual benefit. For example, Coventry twinned with Stalingrad and later with Dresden as an act of peace and reconciliation, all three cities having been heavily bombed during the war. The city of Bath formed an &quot;Alkmaar Adoption committee&quot; in March 1945, when the Dutch city was still occupied by the German Army in the final months of the war, and children from each city took part in exchanges in 1945 and 1946. Similarly, in 1947, Bristol Corporation (later Bristol City Council) sent five &quot;leading citizens&quot; on a goodwill mission to Hanover. Reading in 1947 was the first British town to form links with a former &quot;enemy&quot; city – Düsseldorf, a link that still exists. Since 9 April 1956 Rome and Paris have been exclusively and reciprocally twinned with each other, following the motto: &quot;Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.&quot;

Within Europe, town twinning is supported by the European Union. The support scheme was established in 1989. In 2003 an annual budget of about was allocated to about 1,300 projects. The Council of European Municipalities and Regions also works closely with the commission (DG Education and Culture) to promote modern, high quality twinning initiatives and exchanges that involve all sections of the community. It has launched a website dedicated to town twinning. As of 1995, the European Union had more than 7,000 bilateral relationships involving almost 10,000 European municipalities, primarily French (2837 twinnings) and German (2485 twinnings).

Public art has been used to celebrate twin town links, for instance in the form of seven mural paintings in the centre of the town of Sutton, Greater London. The five main paintings show a number of the main features of the London Borough of Sutton and its four twin towns, along with the heraldic shield of each above the other images. Each painting also features a plant as a visual representation of its town&#x27;s environmental awareness. In the case of Sutton this is in a separate smaller painting (above its main one) showing a beech tree, intended as a symbol of prosperity and from which Carshalton Beeches in the borough derives its name.

Another example of the use of public art is the wall sculpture of the partner cities of Munich, Germany.

A recent study has concluded that geographical distance has very little, if any, influence upon communities&#x27; selections of a twin town. Twinned towns are often chosen because of similarities between them; thus about 15 towns in Wales are twinned with towns in Brittany, and Oxford is with Bonn, Leiden, Grenoble and other university cities. In Italy, two sets of twins are Rovigo with Viernheim, and Bedford with Tulcea. Many former West German cities are twinned with former East German cities; these twinning links were established before the fall of the Iron Curtain. Famous examples are the partnerships of Hanover and Leipzig, both of which have important trade fair grounds, or between Hamburg and Dresden. The first US-German town twinning was in 1947 between Worthington, Minnesota and Crailsheim.
St Petersburg in Russia holds the record for the largest number of partnership arrangements with other communities. In June 2012, the Scottish village of Dull and the US town of Boring, Oregon, agreed to twin their municipalities to promote tourism in both places, playing on their names.

Recently some towns have made novelty twinning arrangements with fictional or virtual locations. Wincanton, England is partnered with Ankh-Morpork from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld books.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC/Pratchett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Town twinning has increasingly been used to form strategic international business links. For example, in the 1990s, when the Nottingham City Council in the UK considered installing a tram network, it consulted experts from its twin city of Karlsruhe, which has one of the most extensive and efficient tram networks in Germany. With assistance from Karlsruhe&#x27;s specialist engineers, Nottingham completed its second tram line in 2013. In 2014, Bristol and New Orleans announced their intention to form a &quot;tuning&quot; partnership based on a shared musical heritage and culture offer, at the initiative of Bristol Mayor George Ferguson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post/Ferguson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Annecy, France and Nerima, Tokyo have for several years shared a partnership based on their &quot;co-existent animation industry&quot;.

==North America==

Toledo, United States twinned with Toledo, Spain in 1931, and was the first city in North America to engage in town twinning. Vancouver, Canada twinned with Odesa, Ukraine in 1944, was the first twinned city in Canada and the second in North America, while Denver, United States, twinned with Brest, France, was the second twinned city in the United States. Liberal, Kansas was twinned with Olney, United Kingdom in 1950, and the cities have run a joint Pancake Day race ever since. Littleton, Colorado, twinned with Bega, Australia, in 1961. Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, was twinned with Seattle, Washington, in 1973. Rochester, Minnesota, and Knebworth, UK, both centers for primary medical research, twinned in 1967. Ontario, California, has five sister cities around the world. They are Brockville, Ontario, Canada (since 1977); Guamúchil, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1982); Mocorito, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1982); Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1988); and Winterthur, Canton of Zürich, Switzerland. Oakville, Ontario is twinned with Dorval, Quebec; Huai&#x27;an, China, and Neyagawa, Osaka, Japan.

Town twinning begins for a variety of reasons. Generally, partner towns have similar demographics and size. They may arise from business connections, travel, similar industries, diaspora communities, or shared history. For example, the partnership between Portland, Oregon and Bologna, Italy arose from shared industries in biotechnology and education, and a &quot;similar attitude towards food,&quot; whereas Chicago&#x27;s link with Warsaw, Poland began with Chicago&#x27;s historic Polish community. The twinning of Indianapolis with Monza, Italy, is due to both cities&#x27; long association with auto racing.

A twin towns program was instituted in the United States in 1956 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a citizen diplomacy initiative. Sister Cities International (SCI) was originally a program of the National League of Cities, but it became a separate corporation in 1967 due to the growth and popularity of the program.

Twin town cultural events include the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C., honoring Washington&#x27;s twin relationship with Tokyo City. Many twinned towns developed business agreements with their partners. For example, Vermont&#x27;s Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Ice Cream company opened a factory in the Republic of Karelia in Russia and offered the same profit-sharing plan to its Russian employees.

== South America ==
==Asia==

China&#x27;s sister city relationships are managed by the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, a united front organization. Sister city initiatives are an increasingly widespread mechanism for Chinese public diplomacy. From the early 2000s until 2024, the number of China&#x27;s sister city relationships doubled. More than one-third of Chinese sister city relationships are with sister cities in the east Asia Pacific region.

Town twinning is supported in Japan by the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations, a joint agency of local governments established by the Japanese government in 1988 (similar to Sister Cities International, its counterpart in the US). In Japan, the international city relations may be split into multiple terms, such as Sister Cities, Friendship Cooperation Cities, Business Partner Cities (BPC), Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Sister Ports / Friendship Ports, etc. China mostly uses the term &quot;friendship cooperation cities&quot; rather than &quot;sister cities&quot;, as the Chinese words for sisters, &quot;姐妹&quot; (reading: jiěmèi, literally elder sister and younger sister), could imply a hierarchical relationship. In the 2010s, Tokyo began to actively promote &#x27;city diplomacy&#x27; with other global cities at the initiative of governor Yoichi Masuzoe.

== Africa ==
==Oceania==
==Linguistic reasons==
Relationships between communities can also arise because of shared names; they may be named after one community (as in the case of Córdoba), they may share names (as in the case of Santiago de Compostela), or their names may have a common etymology. These similarities usually arise from sharing the same or related language or having been a colony or previously conquered.

==Political significance==
The twinning of towns and cities is sometimes done for political purposes. The Hungarian city Gyöngyös was twinned with the Azerbaijani city of Shusha in 2013, signing the twinning agreement with representatives from the Azerbaijani government; Hungary recognised Shusha as &quot;de jure&quot; part of Azerbaijan, even though it was controlled at the time and until 2020 by the military forces of Armenia and the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh. An attempt was made in 2003 by Preston city councillors in England to twin with the Palestinian town of Nablus in the name of solidarity.

Turkey bans partnerships with any city in a country that recognizes the Armenian genocide. As a result, when Bulgaria recognized the genocide in 2016, some twin agreements such as Edirne–Haskovo were terminated by Turkey.

China manages sister city relationships through the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). In April 2019, CPAFFC president Li Xiaolin said, “Friendship city relations have become one of the important channels to implement the Belt and Road Initiative.” In January 2020, Shanghai canceled its sister city relationship with Prague after Prague&#x27;s mayor signed a sister city relationship with Taipei.

In November 2020, U.S. senator Marsha Blackburn introduced legislation, the Sister City Transparency Act, to provide federal oversight to mitigate risks of sister city agreements being used for political influence campaigns. In 2024, Indiana banned localities from entering into sister city agreements with six &quot;foreign adversary&quot; countries.

==Termination==
* In 2011, several British towns ended their twinning arrangements.
* In 2012, the city of Nanjing suspended their sister city relationship with Nagoya after Nanjing Massacre denialist statements by Nagoya&#x27;s mayor, Takashi Kawamura.
* In 2013, the Italian cities of Milan, Venice, and Turin, formerly twinned with Saint Petersburg, suspended their links due to Russia&#x27;s passage of anti-gay legislation. Activists in California circulated petitions urging California cities and counties with relationships with Russian counterparts to take similar steps.
* In 2014, Prague terminated its partnership with Saint Petersburg and Moscow because of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Moscow had been Prague&#x27;s partner city since 1995.
* In 2017, the mayor of Osaka, Hirofumi Yoshimura, ended the city&#x27;s 60-year relationship with San Francisco due to the erection of a memorial to comfort women in downtown San Francisco. Similarly, the cities of Glendale, California, and Higashiōsaka, Japan, came close to terminating their twinning in 2013 and 2014 because of an ongoing dispute over Glendale&#x27;s support for the erection of a statue dedicated to Korean comfort women in a city park.
* In July 2020, the town council of Nieuwegein, a Dutch city south of Utrecht, voted to end its friendship with Puławy in eastern Poland, citing &quot;gay free zones&quot; as the reason.
* In March 2022, the City of Melbourne council voted unanimously to suspend its relationship with St Petersburg as a result of the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* In March 2022, Doncaster cut ties with their twin-town Ozyorsk due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* On 22 March 2022, Coventry voted to temporarily pause the city&#x27;s link with Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) and explore twinning with Mariupol instead due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* On March 28, 2022, Oak Ridge, Tennessee temporarily suspended its relationship with Obninsk due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* In July 2022, the city of Eugene, Oregon suspended its ties to Irkutsk due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* In February 2023, the mayor of Barcelona broke ties with twin city Tel Aviv citing Israeli apartheid as the reason.

<text>Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP (or V&amp;E) is an international law firm with approximately 700 lawyers worldwide headquartered in Downtown Houston, Texas.

The firm has offices in major energy, financial, and political centers worldwide, including Austin, Dallas, Denver, Dubai, Dublin, Houston, London, Los Angeles, New York City, Richmond, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C.

==Profile==

===Founding===
The firm was founded in Houston, Texas, in 1917 by Judge James A. Elkins and William A. Vinson.

===Leadership===
In May 2021, it was announced that the firm elected current partners Keith Fullenweider as chair and Jim Fox, Michael Holmes and Hilary Preston as vice chairs. The change took effect on January 1, 2022. The firm&#x27;s former chairman is Mark Kelly and its managing partner was Scott Wulfe. Vinson &amp; Elkins was named a top-ranked firm and best law firm to work for in Vault&#x27;s 2024 Associate Survey.

===Practice areas===

The firm practices in numerous legal fields, particularly those that pertain to the energy industry, with more than 400 lawyers involved in energy-related legal work. The firm was rated the most prestigious firm in Texas for the fifth year in a row, as well as for having the nation’s strongest practice for Energy, Oil, &amp; Gas for the eighth consecutive year. The firm is highly ranked within Chamber and Partners legal rankings as a leading firm in Corporate and Tax areas, collectively achieving 16 Band 1 practice rankings in the 2023 guide. The firm’s Litigation and Regulatory Department was recognized in 24 practice categories. The firm is recognized as &quot;The World&#x27;s Leading Energy Law Firm&quot; by &quot;Euromoney Magazine&quot; (1995–present.) &quot;In 2023, Chambers &amp; Partners recognized V&amp;E globally, as the leader in Projects &amp; Energy: Oil &amp; Gas.&quot; In 2024, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Legal: Arbitration&quot; identified six partners, Camilo Cardozo, James Loftis, Louise Woods, Scott Stiegler, Nick Henchie and counsel Robert Landicho as leaders in the arbitration arena. &quot;&quot; in 2024, Lawdragon recognized eight Vinson &amp; Elkins lawyers among the world&#x27;s 500 leading cybersecurity lawyers.

===Diversity===
On January 12, 2022, Vinson &amp; Elkins became the founding sponsor of The University of Texas School of Law&#x27;s new Pipeline Program. The firm made a $1 million commitment to support the program. In 2021, Vinson &amp; Elkins was named as a leader in diversity equity and inclusion by Bloomberg as part of Bloomberg Law&#x27;s DEI Framework study. In 2009, the firm was again named a Community of Respect by the Anti-Defamation League, a designation V&amp;E has maintained since the program&#x27;s inception in 2006, and is also the two-time recipient of the Thomas L. Sager Award for the South/Southwest Region by the Minority Corporate Counsel Association for the firm&#x27;s sustained commitment to diversity.

===Controversy===
Vinson &amp; Elkins was implicated in the Enron scandal as Enron&#x27;s legal counsel. For the previous five years, Enron had been one of Vinson &amp; Elkins&#x27; biggest clients and accounted for 8% of their total revenue in 2001. The firm had been made aware of potential accounting fraud in August 2001, but decided that Enron did not need a larger investigation into the issues. Vinson &amp; Elkins was alleged to have approved and structured Enron&#x27;s loss-hiding transactions as well as drafting and approving Enron&#x27;s false SEC filings. Vinson &amp; Elkins settled by paying $30 million to Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy estate but admitted no wrongdoing.

==International==
V&amp;E has been active and has had an office in London for more than 50 years. The firm has represented clients throughout Asia for more than 30 years. V&amp;E&#x27;s office in Tokyo services local commercial hubs, as well as the broader Asia Pacific region. The practice also has a significant presence beyond office locations, with lawyers frequently advising on matters in Australia, India, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The Legal 500 Latin America guide recognizes Vinson &amp; Elkins in the Compliance and Investigations, Corporate and M&amp;A, International Arbitration, Projects and Energy and City Focus – Houston categories, and recommended 19 individuals within the firm. https://www.legal500.com/latin-america/# &quot;Chambers UK&quot; 2024 Recommends Vinson &amp; Elkins in Five Practice Areas, 11 Individual Lawyer Rankings

<doc id="1155319" wikidata="Q3869307" url="?curid=1155319" title="Mix-minus">
<text>In audio engineering, a mix-minus or clean feed is a particular setup of a mixing console or matrix mixer, such that an output of the mixer contains everything &quot;except&quot; a designated input. Mix-minus is often used to prevent echoes or feedback in broadcast or sound reinforcement systems.

==Examples==
A common situation in which a mix-minus is used is when a telephone hybrid is connected to a console, usually at a radio station. The person on the telephone hears all relevant feeds, usually an identical mix to that of the master bus, including the DJ&#x27;s mic feed, except that the caller does not hear their own voice.

Mix-minus is also often used together with IFB systems in electronic news gathering (ENG) for television news reporters and interview subjects speaking to a host from a remote outside broadcast (OB) location. Because of the delay that is introduced in most means of transmission (including satellite feeds and audio over IP connections), the remote subject&#x27;s voice has to be removed from their earpiece. Otherwise, the subject would hear themselves with a slight (but very distracting) delay.

Another common example is in the field of sound reinforcement, when people need to hear a full mix except their own microphone. Legislative bodies of government may use a large mix-minus system, for instance houses of parliament or congressional groups that have a small loudspeaker and a microphone at each seat. From the desktop loudspeaker, each person hears every microphone except their own. This enables all participants to hear each other clearly but minimizes problems with acoustic feedback. In 1994, the first digital audio implementation of such a system was installed at the United States Senate building, with more than 100 mix-minus outputs, one for each senator and also guest seats.

Mix-minus is also used with VoIP communication when recording for podcasts: mix-minus removes the caller&#x27;s voice from the VoIP call, but allows them to hear all other channels available at the mixing console (mixer).

Some broadcast mixing desks, notably those designed in house by the BBC, maintain a separate mix bus for &quot;clean feeds&quot;.

<doc id="1155325" wikidata="Q7301319" url="?curid=1155325" title="Really Useful Group">
<text>The Really Useful Group Ltd. (RUG) is an international company set up in 1977 by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is involved in theatre, film, television, video and concert productions, merchandising, magazine publishing, records and music publishing. The name is inspired by a phrase from the children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Railway Series&quot; (which also inspired Webber to create &quot;Starlight Express&quot;) in which Thomas the Tank Engine and the other locomotives are referred to as &quot;Really Useful Engines&quot;.

==History==
The company was set up in 1977 when Lloyd Webber, frustrated with the terms of his contract with the impresario Robert Stigwood, decided to take greater control over the management of his creative works. All Lloyd Webber compositions and productions created from that point have been owned by the company.

The Really Useful Group was floated on the stock market in 1986. Four years later, Lloyd Webber took it back into private ownership, selling 30% to film and music group PolyGram to fund the cost of buying back shares. In 1995, PolyGram was bought by Canadian conglomerate Seagram, with the Really Useful stake being passed to its own film and music subsidiary, Universal. In 1999, Lloyd Webber paid $US75 million for Universal&#x27;s 30% stake, giving the composer 100% ownership of the group.

==Divisions==

===Really Useful Theatre Company===

The Really Useful Theatre Company produces and manages plays and musicals, mainly, but not limited to those written by Lloyd Webber. It is also responsible for licensing its productions worldwide. In the 1990s, RUT mainly produced shows on its own, but more recently has again developed partnerships with other producers and production companies, notably Bill Kenwright, to produce its works, as it had done in the 1980s with Cameron Mackintosh.

Among its productions and co-productions are:

*&quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; – Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice – London, Broadway, Los Angeles, worldwide

*&quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; – Ken Ludwig – London, Broadway
*&quot;La Bête&quot; – David Hirson – Broadway, London
*&quot;School of Rock&quot;; Broadway 2015

In 2016, Really Useful partnered with Concord Theatricals to act as representative for licensing its works in North America. In October 2021, the groups extended the partnership through 2025.

===Really Useful Films===
Really Useful Films is responsible for the production of film versions of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s catalogue. Initially, these had consisted of lower budget straight-to-video versions of the shows (&quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Joseph&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar,&quot; and &quot;By Jeeves&quot;), but in 2004 the Really Useful Films completed the film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, which was nominated for three Academy Awards and three Golden Globes.

It has also released DVD and video versions of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 50th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall, the 2001 &quot;Masterpiece – Andrew Lloyd Webber in China&quot; concert and a musical version of &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;.

The film director Nick Morris is regularly involved with the films division.

===Really Useful Records===
Really Useful Records produces cast albums of Lloyd Webber musicals. From 1986 until Lloyd Webber regained full control of the company in 1999, Really Useful Records had an exclusive deal with PolyGram to release albums through its Polydor label. Really Useful continues to release its albums and DVDs through Universal, current owners of PolyGram. Aside from cast albums, Lloyd Webber has also produced albums for Marti Webb, Sarah Brightman, Connie Fisher, Andrea Ross and Michael Ball via the label.

Lee Mead, who won the lead role in 2007&#x27;s West End revival of Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat&quot; by taking part in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Any Dream Will Do!&quot; recorded a single of the song &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;. The contest&#x27;s third-placed Lewis Bradley and second-placed Keith Jack joined him on &quot;Close Every Door To Me&quot;. Really Useful Records released the double-A side single to raise funds for the BBC&#x27;s annual Children in Need charity appeal.

===LW Theatres===
LW Theatres owns and manages six West End theatres:

#Adelphi Theatre (in association with the Nederlander Organization)
#Cambridge Theatre
#Gillian Lynne Theatre
#His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre
#London Palladium
#Theatre Royal, Drury Lane

The group also included the Off West End venue The Other Palace, formerly known as the St James Theatre which it sold to Bill Kenwright in October 2021. The theatre reopened under its new owner following a closure caused by the coronavirus pandemic with a revival of the musical .

Lloyd Webber purchased the Palace Theatre in 1983, followed by the New London (now Gillian Lynne) and the Adelphi. In 1999, Lloyd Webber and NatWest Equity Partners bought the Stoll Moss group, owner of 10 London theatres, including the London Palladium and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, for £85 million from Australian businesswoman Janet Holmes à Court, and formed Really Useful Theatres.

In 2004, operational control of the Queen&#x27;s Theatre reverted from Really Useful Theatres back to Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s Delfont Mackintosh Theatres. The transfer of operational control of the adjoining Gielgud Theatre from Really Useful Theatres to Delfont Mackintosh Theatres followed two years later. On 11 July 2005, the company sold four theatres (the Apollo, the Duchess, the Lyric, and the Garrick) to Nimax Theatres Ltd, a company owned by Broadway producer Max Weitzenhoffer, who previously had been a rival bidder for the Stoll Moss theatres, and Nica Burns, production director of Really Useful Theatres. Lloyd Webber invested £10 million of the proceeds from the sales in October 2005 to buy the interest of his partner Bridgepoint (formerly NatWest Equity Partners), and renamed the group &quot;Really Useful Theatres Group&quot;. Nimax purchased The Palace in 2012. In 2014, the group split into two companies, and the owner of the theatres was named &quot;Really Useful Theatres&quot;. In 2018, Really Useful Theatres changed its name to &quot;LW Theatres&quot; to avoid confusion with the other companies owned by Lloyd Webber.

===Really Useful Magazines===
The company formed Really Useful Magazines Ltd to distribute &quot;Theatregoer&quot; magazine, a monthly magazine edited and published on the Really Useful Group&#x27;s behalf by the publishing agency Axon Publishing. Published beginning in 2000, the magazine was available in conjunction with the programmes in all Really Useful Theatres. Really Useful sold &quot;Theatregoer&quot; magazine to Bandwidth Communications, the publisher of &quot;Whatsonstage.com&quot;, in April 2005.

===Other interests===
The Really Useful Group has, in the past, set up sub-labels to cater for pop and dance acts, such as &quot;Carpet Records&quot;, featuring Timmy Mallett&#x27;s Bombalurina (&quot;Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot;) and Doctor Spin (&quot;Tetris&quot;); and ‘’It Records’’, home to My Life Story in the late 1990s. The name Carpet Records was a play on the acronym RUG, of the Really Useful Group.

===Charitable donation===
The group on 27 June 2007 announced that it would donate all receipts from two special performances of a revived West End production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; to the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need charity appeal, which would benefit from ticket sales for 16 July&#x27;s preview and performance of 16 November, on the night of the annual Children in Need telethon. Viewers of a BBC One television show, &quot;Any Dream Will Do!&quot; had voted 25-year-old West End ensemble player and understudy Lee Mead to take role of Joseph in the production. During the contest&#x27;s 9 June 2007 final, host Graham Norton said that &quot;Children in Need&quot; had benefited by more than £500,000 in income from viewer voting on premium-rate telephone lines.

<text>Bottelare is a village in the province of East Flanders, Belgium, at the edge of the Flemish Ardennes. It is now part of the municipality of Merelbeke.

During the 17th century, Bottelare became a famous pilgrimage place, dedicated to Saint Anne. Its gorgeous hall church, a large statue of Saint Anne and the Saint Anne Chapel in the village centre are witnesses of this.
