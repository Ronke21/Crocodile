<text>Romantic poetry is the poetry of the Romantic era, an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century. It involved a reaction against prevailing Neoclassical ideas of the 18th century, and lasted approximately from 1800 to 1850. Romantic poets rebelled against the style of poetry from the eighteenth century which was based around epics, odes, satires, elegies, epistles and songs.

==English==
In early-19th-century England, the poet William Wordsworth defined his and Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s innovative poetry in his new Preface to the second edition (1800) of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;:

I have said before that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin in emotion recollected in tranquility: the emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the tranquility gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind. 

The poems of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; intentionally re-imagined the way poetry should sound: &quot;By fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men,&quot; Wordsworth and his English contemporaries, such as Coleridge, John Keats, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and William Blake, wrote poetry that was meant to boil up from serious, contemplative reflection over the interaction of humans with their environment. Although many stress the notion of spontaneity in Romantic poetry, the movement was still greatly concerned with the difficulty of composition and of translating these emotions into poetic form. Indeed, Coleridge, in his essay &quot;On Poesy or Art&quot;, sees art as &quot;the mediatress between, and reconciler of nature and man&quot;. Such an attitude reflects what might be called the dominant theme of English Romantic poetry: the filtering of natural emotion through the human mind in order to create meaning.

===Characteristics of English romantic poetry===

==== The Sublime ====
The Sublime is considered one of the most important concepts in Romantic poetry. In literature, it refers to use of language and description that excites thoughts and emotions beyond ordinary experience. Although it is often associated with , the sublime may also refer to the grotesque or other extraordinary experiences that &quot;take us beyond ourselves.&quot;

The literary concept of the sublime became important in the eighteenth century. It is associated with the 1757 treatise by Edmund Burke, though it has earlier roots. The idea of the sublime was taken up by Immanuel Kant and the Romantic poets including especially William Wordsworth.

====Reaction against neoclassicism====
Romantic poetry contrasts with Neoclassical poetry, which was the product of intellect and reason, while Romantic poetry is more the product of emotion. Romantic poetry at the beginning of the nineteenth century was a reaction against the set standards, conventions of eighteenth-century poetry. According to William J. Long, &quot;[T]he Romantic movement was marked, and is always marked, by a strong reaction and protest against the bondage of rule and custom which in science and theology as well as literature, generally tend to fetter the free human spirit.&quot;

====Imagination====
Belief in the importance of the imagination is a distinctive feature of romantic poets such as John Keats, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and P. B. Shelley, unlike the neoclassical poets. Keats said, &quot;I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the Heart&#x27;s affections and the truth of Imagination- What the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth.&quot; For Wordsworth and William Blake, as well as Victor Hugo and Alessandro Manzoni, the imagination is a spiritual force, is related to morality, and they believed that literature, especially poetry, could improve the world. The secret of great art, Blake claimed, is the capacity to imagine. To define imagination, in his poem &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot;, Blake said:

====Nature poetry====
Love for nature is another important feature of Romantic poetry, as a source of inspiration. This poetry involves a relationship with external nature and places, and a belief in pantheism. However, the Romantic poets differed in their views about nature. Wordsworth recognized nature as a living thing, teacher, god, and everything. These feelings are fully developed and expressed in his epic poem &quot;The Prelude&quot;. In his poem &quot;The Tables Turned&quot; he writes:

Shelley was another nature poet, who believed that nature is a living thing and there is a union between nature and man. Wordsworth approaches nature philosophically, while Shelley emphasizes the intellect. John Keats was another lover of nature, but Coleridge differs from other Romantic poets of his age, in that he has a realistic perspective on nature. He believes that nature is not the source of joy and pleasure, but rather that people&#x27;s reactions to it depend on their mood and disposition. Coleridge believed that joy does not come from external nature, but that it emanates from the human heart.

====Melancholy====
Melancholy occupies a prominent place in romantic poetry, and is an important source of inspiration for the Romantic poets. In &#x27;&quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, Keats wrote:

====Medievalism====
Romantic poetry was attracted to nostalgia, and medievalism is another important characteristic of romantic poetry, especially in the works of John Keats, for example, &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Merci&quot;, and Coleridge. They were attracted to exotic, remote and obscure places, and so they were more attracted to Middle Ages than to their own age. Medieval Englishman Richard Rolle has been viewed as an early romantic writer with poems such as &quot;The Fire of Love&quot;.

====Hellenism====
The world of classical Greece was important to the Romantics. John Keats&#x27; poetry is full of allusions to the art, literature and culture of Greece, as for example in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;.

====Supernaturalism====
Most of the romantic poets used supernatural elements in their poetry. Samuel Taylor Coleridge is the leading romantic poet in this regard, and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is full of supernatural elements.

====Subjectivity====
Romantic poetry is the poetry of sentiments, emotions and imagination. Romantic poetry opposed the objectivity of neoclassical poetry. Neoclassical poets avoided describing their personal emotions in their poetry, unlike the Romantics.

==France==
French literature from the first half of the century was dominated by Romanticism, which is associated with such authors as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, père, François-René de Chateaubriand, Alphonse de Lamartine, Gérard de Nerval, Charles Nodier, Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier and Alfred de Vigny. Their influence was felt in theatre, poetry, prose fiction. In a 1983 book about the 16th century Catholic poet Jean de La Ceppède, English poet Keith Bosley wrote that Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné, &quot;the epic poet of the Protestant cause&quot;, during the French Wars of Religion, &quot;was forgotten until the Romantics rediscovered him.&quot;

The effect of the romantic movement would continue to be felt in the latter half of the 19th century in diverse literary developments, such as &quot;realism&quot;, &quot;symbolism&quot;, and the so-called fin de siècle &quot;decadent&quot; movement.

==Germany==
German Romanticism was the dominant intellectual movement in the philosophy, the arts, and the culture of German-speaking countries in the late-18th and early 19th centuries. Compared to English Romanticism, German Romanticism developed relatively late, and, in the early years, coincided with Weimar Classicism (1772–1805); in contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety of Romanticism notably valued wit, humour, and beauty.

Sturm und Drang, literally &quot;Storm and Drive&quot;, &quot;Storm and Urge&quot;, though conventionally translated as &quot;Storm and Stress&quot;) is a proto-Romantic movement in German literature and music that took place from the late 1760s to the early 1780s, in which individual subjectivity and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in reaction to the perceived constraints of rationalism imposed by the Enlightenment and associated aesthetic movements. The period is named for Friedrich Maximilian Klinger&#x27;s play &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, which was first performed in 1777.

The philosopher Johann Georg Hamann is considered to be the ideologue of &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, with Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz, H. L. Wagner and Friedrich Maximilian Klinger also significant figures. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was also a notable proponent of the movement, though he and Friedrich Schiller ended their period of association with it by initiating what would become Weimar Classicism.

===Jena Romanticism===
Jena Romanticism – also the Jena Romantics or Early Romanticism (Frühromantik) – is the first phase of Romanticism in German literature represented by the work of a group centered in Jena from about 1798 to 1804, notably Friedrich Schlegel, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. These thinkers were primarily concerned with the problems posed by Immanuel Kant in the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; and what was seen as the failure of the Analytic of the Sublime to accomplish the task set before it: bridging the gap between pure and practical reason. In a different vein, Friedrich Hölderlin and Heinrich von Kleist also grappled with similar philosophical issues in a manner different from the Jena circle.

===Heidelberg Romanticism===
Heidelberg was the centre of the epoch of &quot;Romantik&quot; (Romanticism) in Germany. The phase after Jena Romanticism is often called Heidelberg Romanticism (see also Berlin Romanticism). There was a famous circle of poets, the Heidelberg Romantics, such as Joseph von Eichendorff, Johann Joseph von Görres, Ludwig Achim von Arnim, and Clemens Brentano. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers&#x27; Walk (), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.

The &quot;Romantik&quot; epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the Age of Enlightenment. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.

==Poland==
Romanticism in Poland was a literary, artistic and intellectual period in the evolution of Polish culture, which began around 1820, coinciding with the publication of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s first poems, &quot;Ballads and Romances,&quot; in 1822. It ended with the suppression of the Polish-Lithuanian January 1863 Uprising against the Russian Empire in 1864. The latter event ushered in a new era in Polish culture known as &quot;Positivism&quot;. Some other notable Polish romantic poets include Juliusz Słowacki, Cyprian Kamil Norwid, Zygmunt Krasiński, Tymon Zaborowski, Antoni Malczewski and Józef Bohdan Zaleski.

==Russia==
The 19th century is traditionally referred to as the &quot;Golden Era&quot; of Russian literature. Romanticism permitted a flowering of especially poetic talent: the names of Vasily Zhukovsky and later that of his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Pushkin is credited with both crystallizing the literary Russian language and introducing a new level of artistry to Russian literature. His best-known work is a novel as sonnet sequence, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. An entire new generation of poets including Mikhail Lermontov, Yevgeny Baratynsky, Konstantin Batyushkov, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, Fyodor Tyutchev and Afanasy Fet followed in Pushkin&#x27;s steps.

Pushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature; however, he can&#x27;t be labelled unequivocally as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that,during the 36 years of his life, Pushkin&#x27;s works took a path from neo-Classicism through Romanticism and ultimately to Realism. An alternative assessment suggests that &quot;he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic&quot; and that &quot;he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic&quot;.

===Influence of British Romantic poetry===
Scottish poet Robert Burns became a &quot;people&#x27;s poet&quot; in Russia. In Imperial times the Russian aristocracy were so out of touch with the peasantry that Burns, translated into Russian, became a symbol for the ordinary Russian people. In Soviet Russia, Burns was elevated as the archetypical poet of the people – not least since the Soviet regime slaughtered and silenced its own poets. A new translation of Burns, begun in 1924 by Samuil Marshak, proved enormously popular selling over 600,000 copies. In 1956, the Soviet Union became the first country in the world to honour Burns with a commemorative stamp. The poetry of Burns is taught in Russian schools alongside their own national poets. Burns was a great admirer of the egalitarian ethos behind the French Revolution. Whether Burns would have recognised the same principles at work in the Soviet State at its most repressive is moot. This didn&#x27;t stop the Communists from claiming Burns as one of their own and incorporating his work into their state propaganda. The post-communist years of rampant capitalism in Russia have not tarnished Burns&#x27; reputation.

Lord Byron was a major influence on almost all Russian poets of the Golden Era, including Pushkin, Vyazemsky, Zhukovsky, Batyushkov, Baratynsky, Delvig and, especially, Lermontov.

==Spain==

Germany and England were major influences on Romantic Spanish poetry. During the late 18th century to the late 19th century, Romanticism spread in the form of philosophy and art throughout Western societies, and the earlier period of this movement overlapped with the Age of Revolutions. The idea of the creative imagination was stressed above the idea of reason, and minute elements of nature, including as insects and pebbles, were now considered divine. Nature was perceived in many different ways by the Spanish Romantics, and Instead of employing allegory, as earlier poets had done, these poets tended to use myth and symbol. The power of human emotion furthermore is emphasised during this period.
Leading Romantic poets include Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer (considered the most important), Manuel José Quintana, José Zorrilla, Rosalía de Castro (in Galician and Spanish), and José de Espronceda. In Catalonia, the Romantic movement was a major trigger for the Catalan Renaissance or &#x27;Renaixença&#x27;, which would gradually bring back prestige to the Catalan language and literature (in decadence since its 15th-century Golden Age), with the leading figure in poetry of Jacint Verdaguer. Also, Miquel Costa i Llobera wrote the romantic poem &quot;The Pine of Formentor&quot;, one the most renowned works in Catalan poetry.

==Sweden==
In Swedish literature the Romantic period is between 1809 and 1830, while in Europe, the period is usually seen as running between 1800 and 1850. The Swedish version was very much influenced by German literature. During this relatively short period, there were so many great Swedish poets, that the era is called the Golden Age. The period started around when several periodicals were published that criticised the literature of the 18th century. The important periodical &quot;Iduna&quot;, published by the &quot;Gothic Society&quot; (1811), presented a romanticised version of Gothicismus, a 17th-century cultural movement in Sweden that had centered on the belief in the glory of the Swedish Geats or Goths. The early 19th-century Romantic nationalist version emphasised the Vikings as heroic figures.

==United States==
Transcendentalism was a philosophical movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the eastern region of the United States, rooted in English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, the skepticism of Hume, and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant and of German Idealism. It was also influenced by Indian religions, especially the Upanishads.

The movement was a reaction to or protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality. The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was of particular interest.

Poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892), whose major work &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was first published in 1855, was influenced by transcendentalism. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman&#x27;s poetry praises nature and the individual human&#x27;s role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.

Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) is best known for his poetry and short stories, and is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole. Poe, however, strongly disliked transcendentalism.

Another American Romantic poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882), was the most popular poet of his day. He was one of the first American celebrities and was also popular in Europe, and it was reported that 10,000 copies of &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; sold in London in a single day. However, Longfellow&#x27;s popularity rapidly declined, beginning shortly after his death and into the 20th Century as academics began to appreciate poets like Walt Whitman, Edwin Arlington Robinson, and Robert Frost. In the twentieth century, literary scholar Kermit Vanderbilt noted, &quot;Increasingly rare is the scholar who braves ridicule to justify the art of Longfellow&#x27;s popular rhymings.&quot; 20th-century poet Lewis Putnam Turco concluded &quot;Longfellow was minor and derivative in every way throughout his career [...] nothing more than a hack imitator of the English Romantics.&quot; More recently, an essay by Dana Gioia has spearheaded a revival of readership and scholarly interest in the life and poetry of Longfellow.

There are elements of Romanticism in many later works of American poetry. The influence of Whitman is evident in the work of Langston Hughes and E. E. Cummings; there are echoes of Transcendentalism in poems about nature by Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, and Gary Snyder; there are strains of Romantic individualism in writing by Frank O&#x27;Hara, Sylvia Plath, Adrienne Rich, and the work of the Beat Generation. However, all of these poets are generally identified with more recent movements -- as feminists, Harlem Renaissance writers, modernists, et cetera -- and only indirectly linked with Romanticism by their critics.

== Legacy ==
Some writers consider romantic poetry a way for a better life. Moreover, as Heidi Thomson mentioned in her article, &quot;Why Romantic Poetry Still Matters&quot;, &quot;The more literate and articulate we are, the better our chances for survival as citizens and inhabitants of the earth&quot;.

<doc id="1171658" wikidata="Q800557" url="?curid=1171658" title="Bologna Centrale railway station">
<text>Bologna Centrale is the main railway station in Bologna, Italy. The station is situated at the northern edge of the city centre. It is located at the southern end of the Milan-Bologna high-speed line, which opened on 13 December 2008, and the northern end of three lines between Bologna and Florence: the original Bologna-Florence line through Porretta Terme and Pistoia; the Bologna–Florence Direttissima via Prato, which opened on 22 April 1934 and the Bologna-Florence high-speed line, which opened to traffic on 13 December 2009.

Bologna Centrale is the fifth-busiest in Italy in terms of passenger movements (about 58 million passengers per year). It is, however, one of the busiest, along with Rome Termini Station, for the number of train movements per day (about 800).

The station is linked to Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by the Marconi Express, a direct monorail line in length, launched on 18 November 2020.

== Station ==

There are two levels of railway tracks within the station complex: Bologna Centrale and Bologna Centrale (AV) &quot;alta velocità (high speed)&quot;. The central part of Bologna Centrale contains through tracks for high-speed trains (except Frecciarossa trains which travel only on the Milan-Bologna high-speed line), intercity and regional trains. In addition, there are two groups of side tracks: the western side has six tracks for regional trains from Milan or Verona (with Bologna Centrale as a terminus) and the eastern side has six tracks for regional trains from Prato, Ancona and Pescara (with Bologna Centrale as a terminus).

=== Bologna Centrale (AV) ===
In July 2008, Andrea Maffei Architects, Arata Isozaki &amp; Associates, Ove Arup &amp; Partners and M + T &amp; Partners won a competition to design a new station, Bologna Centrale (AV), for high-speed trains between Milan and Florence. The proposal was selected by architect Gae Aulenti, as president of the International Competition Jury, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, the main entity behind the competition. The station uses light in its design, with the internal courtyards of the bridged station creating poles of light. Inside the station it is possible to see the levels below, and different shapes of windows were designed for the courtyards.

The new, three-level, railway station was built underneath the current station. It is long and wide, and consists of three below-ground levels. The first level, at is for parking, pick-ups and drop-offs. The second level, at , is a shopping arcade. The lowest level, at , consists of four high-speed train platforms (lines 16 to 19).

The underground platforms opened for passenger service on 9 June 2013. Together with the reinstatement of four surface tracks, which were removed to facilitate construction, the project is due to be completed by 2016. The expected cost was €340 million.

This high-speed station is connected by a series of walkways and elevators to the central part. Transfer time is approximately 10 minutes on foot.

== History ==
The first Bologna Centrale station was constructed in 1859, though its history is unclear. A new station was built twelve years later on the same grounds.

The modern station was designed and built by architect Gaetano Ratti, who trained in the local Clementine Academy. Inspired by the neoclassical style, the station&#x27;s distinctive 15th century façade opens in nine entrance doors. The main passenger building is reminiscent of renaissance Florentine architecture. Until the 1940s, it was topped by a clock tower with marble pillars, but the tower was damaged by allied bombings in the Second World War and not rebuilt.

The original design called for a rectangular shaped, two-faced building, with a marble external façade and a steel internal one. Subsequent extension works, such as the 1926 building of the westbound platforms, shaped the station into the “L” form, typical of expanded transit stations. The introduction of new platforms at the eastern half in 1934, brought another change to the station&#x27;s configuration.

===1980 terrorist bombing===
On 2 August 1980 at 10.25 am, an improvised explosive device (IED) made with of a TNT mixture was detonated inside Bologna&#x27;s main railway station. The IED was contained in a suitcase, which was placed near the wall inside a lobby. The explosion killed 85 people and injured more than 200. The wing of the station in which the bomb was detonated has been reconstructed but, as a testimony to the victims of the attack, the original pavement was maintained as well as a deep crack in the main wall. The attack is also known in Italy as the &quot;Strage di Bologna&quot;, the &quot;Bologna massacre&quot;.

The Italian government immediately accused the Italian neo-fascist militant groups for the attack; however this was denied by the group, and no one ever claimed responsibility. After 15 years, official investigation has determined that the attack was carried out by a small neo-fascist group, call &quot;Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari&quot;. Many conspiracy theories regarding this event have been entertained, including a link between this act of terrorism and the loss of Itavia Flight 870.

<doc id="1171671" wikidata="Q638276" url="?curid=1171671" title="Bishop of Ramsbury">
<text>The Bishop of Ramsbury is an episcopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury, in the Province of Canterbury, England. The title takes its name from the village of Ramsbury in Wiltshire, and was first used between the 10th and 11th centuries by the Anglo-Saxon Bishops of Ramsbury; the modern See was erected under the Suffragans Nomination Act 1888 by Order in Council dated 24 October 1973. From the establishment of the Salisbury area scheme in 1981 until its abolition in 2009, the bishops suffragan of Ramsbury were area bishops. The bishop oversees the Wiltshire parts of the diocese, i.e. the Archdeaconries of Sarum and Wiltshire.

The diocese announced in August 2011 that the Bishop of Salisbury had commissioned (under new national guidelines) a consultation as to whether a new Bishop of Ramsbury should be appointed.

The Roman Catholic Church has also a Bishop of Ramsbury (&quot;Ramsbiria&quot; as latin name), a titular bishop since 1969 (currently James Curry, Auxiliary Bishop in Westminster).

<doc id="1171679" wikidata="Q895138" url="?curid=1171679" title="Jumping stilts">
<text>Jumping stilts, bounce stilts or spring stilts are special stilts that allow the user to run, jump and perform various acrobatics. Spring stilts using fiberglass leaf springs were patented in the United States in 2004 under the trademark &quot;PowerSkip&quot;, marketed for recreational and extreme sports use. Spring stilts are often mostly made of aluminium. Using these stilts is also called &quot;bocking&quot; or &quot;powerbocking&quot;, derived from &quot;Alexander Böck&quot;, the stilts&#x27; inventor.

==Powerbocking==
The act of &quot;bocking&quot; or &quot;powerbocking&quot; includes jumping, running, and performing acrobatics with elastic-like spring-loaded stilts. They can be used to jump great distances and allow the user to bounce over people and cars and to perform backflips. For some, it is an extreme sport; for others, it is a form of exercise, artistic expression and a form of entertainment.

The stilts are often referred to generically as bocks or powerbocks; as power stilts, jumping stilts, bounce stilts or spring stilts; or by their brand name.

==Description==
Each boot consists of a foot-plate with snowboard type locking straps, rubber foot pad which is also commonly called a hoof, and a fibreglass leaf spring. Using only their weight, and few movements, the user is generally able to jump 3–5 ft (1–1.5 metres) off the ground and run up to 20 mph (32 km/h). They also give the ability to take up to 9-foot (2.7 metres) strides.

Jumping stilts were used in the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing.

They were originally patented by Alexander Böck, from Germany (European Patent EP 1 196 220 B1 on 2 July 2003, US Patent No. 6,719,671 B1 on 13 April 2004, both with a priority date of 20 July 1999), as &quot;Powerskip&quot;. Many people also use common brand names to refer to them generically. Common brand names are 7 League Boots, Air-Trekkers, Powerizers, Pro-Jump, and Powerskips.

==Risks==
On 4 December 2010 Samuel Koch was heavily injured during the show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; during a stunt where he attempted to jump over multiple moving cars in succession. He failed to clear one of the moving vehicles and was left tetraplegic after suffering severe injuries to his neck and spine.

== Competition ==
Two competitions exist in France: the Nancy Power Days (since 2009) in Nancy and the Riser Winter Cup (since 2015) in Lille.

==Similar devices==
Though similar in appearance, jumping stilts are not to be confused with the use of prosthetic devices such as those used by paralympic runners Oscar Pistorius or Jonnie Peacock.

Moon shoes and PyonPyon jumpers are earlier attempts at jumping shoes using a different technique. Some are still popular today. There is a Swiss product &quot;Kangoo Jumps&quot;, with cantilever springs under the shoes, which is promoted more for fitness than large leaps. Rocket boots were designed in the 1970s for the Russian Army, and use combustion pistons rather than springs for a similar effect.

Similar devices appear in the Portal video game series, allowing the protagonist, Chell, to survive falls from great height unharmed. Though, they do not affect her ability to walk or jump.

An English folklore figure spring-heeled Jack has been conjectured by some investigators to have been a prankster using spring-loaded leaping aids as early as 1837.

Spring stilts using steel coil springs, an antecedent of the pogo stick, were attempted in the 19th century.

<text>Handycam is a line of camcorders made by Sony and introduced in 1985.

Handycam was first used as the name of the first Video8 camcorder in 1985, replacing Sony&#x27;s previous line of Betamax-based models of camcorders. The name was intended to emphasize the &quot;handy&quot; palm size nature of the camera, made possible by the then-new miniaturized tape format. This was in contrast to the larger, shoulder mounted cameras made before the creation of Video8, as well as competing smaller formats such as VHS-C.

== Formats ==
Sony has continued to produce Handycams in a variety of guises ever since, developing the Video8 format to produce Hi8 (equivalent to S-VHS quality) and later Digital8, using the same basic format to record digital video. The Handycam label continues to be applied as recording formats evolve, such as adopting the MiniDV, MiniDVD, and MicroMV formats, and then later using hard disk drives and flash memory.

== Functionality ==
=== Night vision ===

Select flagship Sony Handycam models feature infrared night-vision dubbed &quot;NightShot&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;NightShot Plus&quot; on some models), which utilizes an infrared light-emitting diode and an infrared filter that is mechanically attached and detached to the sensor in order to enable the camcorder to record video footage in complete darkness (&quot;Nightshot 0 lux&quot;). This feature has been occasionally used with paranormal investigators on Travel Channel&#x27;s Ghost Adventures.

=== Metadata ===
MiniDV tape Handycam camcorders record a time code and video recording parameters (such as light sensitivity (in &quot;dB&quot;), aperture, exposure time, and info) on an additional meta data track on the tape.

==Models==

*Video8 Handycam (1985-1989) (These continued for sale into the 90s)
*Hi8 Handycam (1989-2007)
*Digital8 Handycam (1999-2007)
*DV Handycam (1995-)
*HDV Handycam
*DVD-Handycam
*MicroMV Handycam
*HDD Handycam
*Memory Stick Handycam (using Memory Stick Pro Duo. Up to 16GB)
*SD Card Handycam (with or without internal flash memory)
*4K Handycam

<doc id="1171683" wikidata="Q4952048" url="?curid=1171683" title="Boy (Canadian band)">
<text>Boy was a Canadian indie pop band, originally the solo project of Whitehorse native Stephen Kozmeniuk. The band consisted of vocalist and general instrumentalist Kozmeniuk, drummer Maurie Kaufmann, bassist Steve Payne, and guitarists Rolla Olak and James Robertson.

== History ==
Stephen Kozmeniuk (born 1982) grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon. &quot;Boy&quot; was initially his solo project, and he recorded his first album using Pro Tools in his bedroom in Whitehorse. In 2002, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; described Boy&#x27;s music as &quot;art rock with a Brit twist, combined with an ultracool, laid-back attitude&quot;. At the time, Kozmeniuk was using the name Stephen Noel. He was then signed to Bumstead Records, which re-released the album in 2003. As Boy, he toured nationally in support of the album, opening for artists such as Sam Roberts, 54-40 and Broken Social Scene.

Boy then expanded to a five-man band with new members guitarist James Robertson of Toronto; drummer Maurie Kaufmann from Nanaimo; bassist Steve Payne from Winnipeg; and guitarist Rolla Olak from Victoria. The 2004 album &quot;Every Page You Turn&quot;, produced by Brenndan McGuire of Sloan fame, was recorded in a Vancouver Island cabin. The lead single, &quot;Same Old Song&quot;, received airplay on rock radio stations across Canada, peaking at #6 on Canada&#x27;s Rock chart. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game FIFA 06. The second single, &quot;Up In This Town&quot;, also received significant airplay, peaking at #7 on Canada&#x27;s Rock chart. The band toured Canada along with Pilate, and played the South by Southwest festival in Texas, and the 2005 Summer Sonic Festival in Japan.

The band&#x27;s style was likened to that of Sam Roberts, with influences of late-1960s and 70s British pop-rock music.

<doc id="1171685" wikidata="Q273104" url="?curid=1171685" title="Helen Chandler">
<text>Helen Chandler (February 1, 1906 – April 30, 1965) was an American film and theatre actress, best known for playing Mina Seward in the 1931 horror film &quot;Dracula&quot;.

==Career==

Chandler attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York and made her Broadway debut on September 2, 1918 at the Globe Theatre in &quot;Penrod&quot;, Edward E. Rose&#x27;s adaptation of the like-named Booth Tarkington series of stories. Her early performances include Arthur Hopkins&#x27; 1920 production of &quot;Richard III&quot;, which starred John Barrymore, &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1921 with Lionel Barrymore; Hedvig in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; in 1925 and Ophelia in the 1925 modern dress version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Basil Sydney. By the time of her first film she had been in over twenty Broadway productions.

She made her film debut in 1927 in the silent film &quot;The Music Master&quot; and in 1930 joined Leslie Howard, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Beryl Mercer for &quot;Outward Bound&quot;, the film version of the stage success. The unusual story told of a group of passengers on an ocean liner who gradually realize that they are all dead and will soon face the Last Judgment. Chandler, with her blonde hair and ethereal quality, was considered to be perfectly cast, and she received critical praise for her performance.

Chandler joined David Manners and Bela Lugosi in what became one of the most successful movies made at that time. Chandler appeared with Manners that same year in the Lost Generation celebration of alcohol in Paris, &quot;The Last Flight&quot;, also starring Richard Barthelmess and John Mack Brown. She achieved more successes in &quot;A House Divided&quot; (1931) and &quot;Christopher Strong&quot; (1933), all the while dividing her time among films, radio work, and theater roles in Los Angeles, New York and London.

She starred in British actor Will Hay&#x27;s 1934 movie, &quot;Radio Parade of 1935&quot; and played a role on Lux Radio in &quot;Alibi Ike&quot; with Joe E. Brown (1937). Among her later stage successes were &quot;Within The Gates&quot; in 1934, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in 1935, &quot;Lady Precious Stream&quot; in 1936 with then-husband Bramwell Fletcher, a reprise of her film role in &quot;Outward Bound&quot; in 1938 and various productions of &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; and Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;

==Personal life==
Helen Frances Chandler was born February 1, 1908, in New York, according to family, although the date and place have been reported as 1906 in Charleston, South Carolina and New York in 1909. Her parents were Leland S. and Frances (nee Murray) Chandler. Her family did live in Charleston for a time, where her younger brother Leland M. Chandler was born. She and her brother were raised by their mother as stage children, although her brother rebelled and quit. Chandler would later live off and on with her brother and his family in the Los Angeles area from the 1930s to 1950s.

Chandler&#x27;s first marriage was to writer Cyril Hume in 1930, and they divorced in 1934. She subsequently married actor Bramwell Fletcher on February 14, 1935, at Riverside Church in New York, but they divorced in 1940. From February 3, 1943 until her death, Chandler was married to Walter S. Piascik, a merchant seaman.

By the late 1930s she was battling alcoholism and her acting career declined. She was hospitalized several times but was unable to gain control over her life. In 1950, Chandler was severely burned in an apartment fire, caused by her falling asleep while smoking. She survived but her body was badly disfigured. Her alcoholism continued unabated after the accident.

==Death==
Chandler died on April 30, 1965, following surgery in Hollywood, California and was cremated according to her wishes. She was survived by her husband, Walter Piascik. Chandler&#x27;s original inurnment site was the private vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. After an online fundraising effort led by researcher Jessica Wahl and Hollywood Graveyard YouTube channel creator Arthur Dark and with the permission of her surviving family, Chandler&#x27;s ashes were reinurned in the Cathedral Mausoleum of Hollywood Forever Cemetery on July 13, 2023.

<text>The regulatory T cells (Tregs or Treg cells), formerly known as suppressor T cells, are a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune disease. Treg cells are immunosuppressive and generally suppress or downregulate induction and proliferation of effector T cells. Treg cells express the biomarkers CD4, FOXP3, and CD25 and are thought to be derived from the same lineage as naïve CD4+ cells. Because effector T cells also express CD4 and CD25, Treg cells are very difficult to effectively discern from effector CD4+, making them difficult to study. Research has found that the cytokine transforming growth factor beta(TGF-β) is essential for Treg cells to differentiate from naïve CD4+ cells and is important in maintaining Treg cell homeostasis.

Mouse models have suggested that modulation of Treg cells can treat autoimmune disease and cancer and can facilitate organ transplantation and wound healing. Their implications for cancer are complicated. Treg cells tend to be upregulated in individuals with cancer, and they seem to be recruited to the site of many tumors. Studies in both humans and animal models have implicated that high numbers of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment is indicative of a poor prognosis, and Treg cells are thought to suppress tumor immunity, thus hindering the body&#x27;s innate ability to control the growth of cancerous cells. Immunotherapy research is studying how regulation of T cells could possibly be utilized in the treatment of cancer.

==Populations==
T regulatory cells are a component of the immune system that suppress immune responses of other cells. This is an important &quot;self-check&quot; built into the immune system to prevent excessive reactions. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express CD4, CD25, and FOXP3 (CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells). These Treg cells are different from helper T cells. Another regulatory T cell subset is Treg17 cells. Regulatory T cells are involved in shutting down immune responses after they have successfully eliminated invading organisms, and also in preventing autoimmunity.

CD4+ FOXP3+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells have been called &quot;naturally occurring&quot; regulatory T cells to distinguish them from &quot;suppressor&quot; T cell populations that are generated &quot;in vitro&quot;. Additional regulatory T cell populations include Tr1, Th3, CD8+CD28−, and Qa-1 restricted T cells. The contribution of these populations to self-tolerance and immune homeostasis is less well defined. FOXP3 can be used as a good marker for mouse CD4+CD25+ T cells, although recent studies have also shown evidence for FOXP3 expression in CD4+CD25− T cells. In humans, FOXP3 is also expressed by recently activated conventional T cells and thus does not specifically identify human Tregs.

==Development==
All T cells derive from progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which become committed to their lineage in the thymus. All T cells begin as CD4-CD8-TCR- cells at the DN (double-negative) stage, where an individual cell will rearrange its T cell receptor genes to form a unique, functional molecule, which they, in turn, test against cells in the thymic cortex for a minimal level of interaction with self-MHC. If they receive these signals, they proliferate and express both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive cells. The selection of Tregs occurs on radio-resistant hematopoietically derived MHC class II-expressing cells in the medulla or Hassall&#x27;s corpuscles in the thymus. At the DP (double-positive) stage, they are selected by their interaction with the cells within the thymus, begin the transcription of Foxp3, and become Treg cells, although they may not begin to express Foxp3 until the single-positive stage, at which point they are functional Tregs. Tregs do not have the limited TCR expression of NKT or γδ T cells; Tregs have a larger TCR diversity than effector T cells, biased towards self-peptides.

The process of Treg selection is determined by the affinity of interaction with the self-peptide MHC complex. Selection to become a Treg is a &quot;Goldilocks&quot; process - i.e. not too high, not too low, but just right; a T cell that receives very strong signals will undergo apoptotic death; a cell that receives a weak signal will survive and be selected to become an effector cell. If a T cell receives an intermediate signal, then it will become a regulatory cell. Due to the stochastic nature of the process of T cell activation, all T cell populations with a given TCR will end up with a mixture of Teff and Treg – the relative proportions determined by the affinities of the T cell for the self-peptide-MHC. Even in mouse models with TCR-transgenic cells selected on specific-antigen-secreting stroma, deletion or conversion is not complete.

After interaction with the self-peptide MHC complex, a T cell must upregulate IL-2R, CD25 and the TNFR superfamily members GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 to become a CD25+FOXP3− Treg cell progenitor. Expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 is then required for this cell to become a mature Treg. Foxp3 expression is driven by γ-chain (CD132) dependent cytokines, in particular IL-2 and/or IL-15. IL-2 alone is not sufficient to stimulate Foxp3 expression. While IL-2 is produced by self-reactive thymocytes, IL-15 is produced by stromal cells of the thymus, mainly mTECs and cTECs.

Recently, another subset of Treg precursors was identified. This subset lacks CD25 and has low expression of Foxp3. Its development is mainly dependent on IL-15. This subset has a lower affinity for self antigens than the CD25+Foxp3high subset. Both subsets generate mature Treg cells after stimulation with IL-2 with comparable efficiency both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. CD25+Foxp3high progenitors exhibit increased apoptosis and develop into mature Treg cells with faster kinetics than Foxp3low progenitors. Tregs derived from CD25+Foxp3high progenitors protect from experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, whereas those derived from CD25+Foxp3low progenitors protect from T-cell induced colitis.

Mature CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs can be also divided into two different subsets based on the expression level of CD25, GITR, and PD-1. Tregs expressing low amounts of CD25, GITR and PD-1 limit the development of colitis by promoting the conversion of conventional CD4+ T cells into pTreg. Tregs highly expressing CD25, GITR and PD-1 are more self-reactive and control lymphoproliferation in peripheral lymph nodes - they may have the ability to protect against autoimmune disorders.

Foxp3+ Treg generation in the thymus is delayed by several days compared to Teff cells and does not reach adult levels in either the thymus or periphery until around three weeks post-partum. Treg cells require CD28 co-stimulation and B7.2 expression is largely restricted to the medulla, the development of which seems to parallel the development of Foxp3+ cells. It has been suggested that the two are linked, but no definitive link between the processes has yet been shown. TGF-β is not required for Treg functionality, in the thymus, as thymic Tregs from TGF-β insensitive TGFβRII-DN mice are functional.

=== Thymic recirculation ===

It has been observed that some FOXP3+ Treg cells recirculate to thymus. These Tregs were mainly present in thymic medulla, which is the main site of Treg cells differentiation.
The presence of these cells in the thymus or their addition to fetal thymic tissue culture suppress the development of new Treg cells by 34–60% without affecting conventional T cells. This suggests that these Tregs only inhibit &quot;de novo&quot; development of Treg cells.
The molecular mechanism of this process depends upon the ability of Tregs to adsorb IL-2 from their microenvironments, an ability that allows them to induce the apoptosis of T cells that need IL-2 as main growth factor. Recirculating T in the thymus express high levels of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25), encoded by the &quot;Il2ra&quot; gene, which gathers IL-2 from thymic medulla and decreases its concentration. In contrast, newly-generated FOXP3+ Treg cells in thymus do not have a high level of &quot;Il2ra&quot; expression. IL-2 is a cytokine necessary for the development of Treg cells in the thymus. It is involved in the proliferation and survival of all T cells, but IL-15 may replace its activity in many contexts. However, Treg cells&#x27; development is dependent on IL-2. A population of CD31 negative Treg cells has been found in the human thymus, suggesting that CD31 may be used as a marker for newly-generated Treg cells and other T lymphocytes. Mature and peripheral Treg cells downregulate the expression of CD31, suggesting that this mechanism of thymic Treg development may also be functional in humans.

There is probably also positive regulation of thymic Treg cells development caused by recirculating Treg cells into thymus. A thymic population of CD24 low FOXP3+ has been discovered with increased expression of IL-1R2 (&quot;Il1r2&quot;) compared to peripheral Treg cells. High concentrations of IL-1β caused by inflammation decrease &quot;de novo&quot; development of Treg cells in the thymus. The presence of recirculating Treg cells in the thymus with high IL1R2 expression during inflammatory conditions helps to uptake IL-1β and reduce its concentration in the medulla microenvironment, thus aiding the development of &quot;de novo&quot; Treg cells. Binding of IL-1β to IL1R2 on the surface of Treg cells does not cause signal transduction because the Intracellular (TIR) Toll interleukin-1 receptor domain, which is normally present in innate immune cells, is absent in Tregs.

== Function ==

The immune system must be able to discriminate between self and non-self. When self/non-self discrimination fails, the immune system destroys cells and tissues of the body and as a result causes autoimmune diseases. Regulatory T cells actively suppress activation of the immune system and prevent pathological self-reactivity, i.e. autoimmune disease. The critical role regulatory T cells play within the immune system is evidenced by the severe autoimmune syndrome that results from a genetic deficiency in regulatory T cells (IPEX syndrome – see also below).

The molecular mechanism by which regulatory T cells exert their suppressor/regulatory activity has not been definitively characterized and is the subject of intense research. &quot;In vitro&quot; experiments have given mixed results regarding the requirement of cell-to-cell contact with the cell being suppressed. The following represent some of the proposed mechanisms of immune suppression:
* Regulatory T cells produce a number of inhibitory cytokines. These include TGF-β, Interleukin 35, and Interleukin 10. It also appears that regulatory T cells can induce other cell types to express interleukin-10.
* Regulatory T cells can produce Granzyme B, which in turn can induce apoptosis of effector cells. Regulatory T cells from Granzyme B deficient mice are reported to be less effective suppressors of the activation of effector T cells.
* Reverse signalling through direct interaction with dendritic cells and the induction of immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.
* Signalling through the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 with the production of immunosuppressive adenosine.
* Through direct interactions with dendritic cells by LAG3 and by TIGIT. This review of Treg interactions with dendritic cells provides distinction between mechanisms described for human cells versus mouse cells.
* Another control mechanism is through the IL-2 feedback loop. Antigen-activated T cells produce IL-2 which then acts on IL-2 receptors on regulatory T cells alerting them to the fact that high T cell activity is occurring in the region, and they mount a suppressory response against them. This is a negative feedback loop to ensure that overreaction is not occurring. If an actual infection is present other inflammatory factors downregulate the suppression. Disruption of the loop leads to hyperreactivity, regulation can modify the strength of the immune response. A related suggestion with regard to interleukin 2 is that activated regulatory T cells take up interleukin 2 so avidly that they deprive effector T cells of sufficient to avoid apoptosis.
* A major mechanism of suppression by regulatory T cells is through the prevention of co-stimulation through CD28 on effector T cells by the action of the molecule CTLA-4.

== Natural and induced regulatory T cells ==
T regulatory lymphocytes develop during ontogeny either in the thymus or in the periphery. Accordingly, they are divided into natural and induced T regulatory cells.

Natural T regulatory lymphocytes (tTregs, nTregs) are characterized by continuous expression of FoxP3 and T cell receptor (TCR) with relatively high autoaffinity. These cells are predominantly found in the body in the bloodstream or lymph nodes and serve mainly to confer tolerance to autoantigens.

Induced (peripheral) T regulatory cells (iTregs, pTregs) arise under certain situations in the presence of IL-2 and TGF-b in the periphery and begin to express FoxP3 inducibly, thus becoming the functional equivalent of tTreg cells. iTregs, however, are found primarily in peripheral barrier tissues, where they are primarily involved in preventing inflammation in the presence of external antigens.

The main features that differentiate tTreg and iTreg cells include Helios and Neuropilin-1, the presence of which suggests origin in the thymus. Another feature distinguishing these two Treg cell populations is the stability of FoxP3 expression in different settings.

=== Induced T regulatory cells ===
Induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells (CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+) are suppressive cells involved in tolerance. iTreg cells have been shown to suppress T cell proliferation and experimental autoimmune diseases. These cells include Treg17 cells. iTreg cells develop from mature CD4+ conventional T cells outside of the thymus: a defining distinction between natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells and iTreg cells. Though iTreg and nTreg cells share a similar function iTreg cells have recently been shown to be &quot;an essential non-redundant regulatory subset that supplements nTreg cells, in part by expanding TCR diversity within regulatory responses&quot;. Acute depletion of the iTreg cell pool in mouse models has resulted in inflammation and weight loss. The contribution of nTreg cells versus iTreg cells in maintaining tolerance is unknown, but both are important. Epigenetic differences have been observed between nTreg and iTreg cells, with the former having more stable FOXP3 expression and wider demethylation.

The small intestinal environment is high in vitamin A and is a location where retinoic acid is produced. The retinoic acid and TGF-beta produced by dendritic cells within this area signal for production of regulatory T cells. Vitamin A and TGF-beta promote T cell differentiation into regulatory T cells opposed to Th17 cells, even in the presence of IL-6. The intestinal environment can lead to induced regulatory T cells with TGF-beta and retinoic acid, some of which express the lectin-like receptor CD161 and are specialized to maintain barrier integrity by accelerating wound healing. The Tregs within the gut are differentiated from naïve T cells after antigen is introduced. It has recently been shown that human regulatory T cells can be induced from both naive and pre-committed Th1 cells and Th17 cells using a parasite-derived TGF-β mimic, secreted by &quot;Heligmosomoides polygyrus&quot; and termed &quot;Hp&quot;-TGM (&quot;H. polygyrus&quot; TGF-β mimic). &quot;Hp&quot;-TGM can induce murine FOXP3 expressing regulatory T cells that were stable in the presence of inflammation &quot;in vivo&quot;. &quot;Hp&quot;-TGM-induced human FOXP3+ regulatory T cells were stable in the presence of inflammation and had increased levels of CD25, CTLA4 and decreased methylation in the &quot;FOXP3&quot; Treg-Specific demethylated region compared to TGF-β-induced Tregs.

=== RORγt+ regulatory T lymphocytes ===
Approximately 30%–40% of colonic FoxP3+ Treg cells express the transcription factor RORγt. The iTregs are able to differentiate into RORγt-expressing cells and thus acquire the phenotype of Th17 cells. These cells are associated with the functions of mucosal lymphoid tissues such as the intestinal barrier. In the intestinal lamina propria, 20-30% of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells expressing RORyt are found and this high proportion is strongly dependent on the presence of a complex gut microbiome. In germ-free (GF) mice, the population of RORγt+ T regulatory cells is strongly reduced, whereas recolonization by the specific pathogen-free (SPF) microbiota restores normal numbers of these lymphocytes in the gut. The mechanism by which the gut microbiota induces the formation of RORγt+ Treg cells involves the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), on which this induction is dependent. SCFAs are a by-product of fermentation and digestion of dietary fiber, therefore, microbial-free mice have very low concentrations of both SCFAs and RORγt Treg cells. Induction of RORγt Treg cells is also dependent on the presence of dendritic cells in adults, Thetis cells in neonatal and antigen presentation by MHC II.

RORγt+ Treg cells are not present in the thymus and do not express Helios or Neuropilin-1, but have high expression of CD44, IL-10, ICOS, CTLA-4, and the nucleotidases CD39 and CD73, suggesting a strong regulatory function.

==== Function of RORγt+ regulatory T lymphocytes ====
Induction of RORγt+ Treg cells in lymph nodes of the small intestine is crucial for the establishment of intestinal luminal antigen tolerance. These cells are particularly important in the prevention of food allergies. One mechanism is the production of suppressive molecules such as the cytokine IL-10. These cells also suppress the Th17 cell population and inhibit the production of IL-17, thus suppressing the pro-inflammatory response.

In mice, colonic RORγt+ Tregs are absent during the first two weeks after birth. Generation of RORγt+ Treg early after birth is essential to prevent the development of various intestinal immunopathologies later in life. Particularly crucial is a time period of gradual transition from relying solely on maternal milk to incorporating solid food, between 15 and 20 days of age, when a large number of microbial antigens is introduced and commensal microbiota are settling in the intestine. During this time, protective RORγt+ Treg cells are induced by the microbial antigens and normal intestinal homeostasis is sustained by induction of tolerance to commensal microbiota. Lack of RORγt+ Treg cell induction led in mice to the development of severe colitis. The quantity of early-life-induced RORγt+ Tregs is influenced by maternal milk, particularly by the amount of IgA antibodies present in the maternal milk. In adult mice, RORγt+ Tregs and IgA exhibit mutual inhibition. Similarly, mice nursed by foster mothers with higher IgA titers in their milk will develop fewer RORγt+ Tregs compared to those fed with milk containing lower IgA titers.

RORγt+ Tregs were also shown for their importance in oral tolerance and prevention of food allergies. Infants with developed food allergies have different composition of fecal microbiota in comparison to healthy infants and have increased IgE bound to fecal microbiota and decreased secretory IgA. In mice, protection against food allergies was induced by introduction of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales species. Upon their introduction, expansion of gut RORγt+ Treg cells in favor of GATA3+ Treg occurs,  mediating the protection against allergies.

Deficiency of tryptophan, an essential amino acid, alters commensal microbiota metabolism which results in expansion of RORγt+ Treg cells and reduction of Gata3+ Treg cells. This induction is possibly regulated by stimulation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor by metabolites produced by commensal bacteria using tryptophan as an energy source.

Lower number of RORγt+ Treg cells is present in germ free mice colonized with microbiota associated with Inflammatory bowel disease compared to germ free mice colonized with healthy microbiota. Dysregulation of RORγt+ Treg cells favors the expansion of Th2 cells and lower number of RORγt+ Treg cells is compensated by increased Helios+ Treg cells. How exactly may RORγt+ Tregs protect from colitis is not yet known.

==== RORγt+ regulatory T lymphocytes in cancer ====
Pathological may be involvement of RORγt+ regulatory T cells in colorectal cancer. It was found, that RORγt+ Tregs which are able to express IL-17 are expanded in colorectal cancer and as cancer develops, they lose the ability to express anti-inflammatory IL-10. Similarly such RORγt+ Tregs expressing IL-17 are expanded in mucosa of patients with Crohn´s disease. Depletion of RORγt+ Tregs in mice with colorectal cancer caused enhancement of reactivity of tumor-specific T cells and improved cancer immune surveillance. This improvement is not caused by the loss of IL-17 as that was proved to promote cancer progression. In tumors of mice with conditional knockout of RORγt+ Tregs was confirmed downregulation of IL-6, reduction of IL-6 expressing CD11c+ dendritic cells and overexpression of CTLA-4. IL-6 mediates activation of STAT3 transcription factor which is critical for proliferation of cancer cells.

=== Gata3+ regulatory T lymphocytes ===
Another important subset of Treg cells are Gata3+ Treg cells, which respond to IL-33 in the gut and influence the regulation of effector T cells during inflammation. Unlike RORγt+ Treg cells, these cells express Helios and are not dependent on the microbiome.

Gata3+ T regs are major immunosuppressors during intestinal inflammation and T regs use Gata3 to limit tissue inflammation. This cell population also restrict Th17 T cells immunity in the intestine, because Gata3-deficient T regs express higher &quot;Rorc&quot; and &quot;IL-17a&quot; transcript.

==Disease==

An important question is how the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells is modulated during the course of an ongoing immune response. While the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells prevents the development of autoimmune disease, it is not desirable during immune responses to infectious microorganisms.

=== Infections ===
Upon encounter with infectious microorganisms, the activity of regulatory T cells may be downregulated, either directly or indirectly, by other cells to facilitate elimination of the infection. Experimental evidence from mouse models suggests that some pathogens may have evolved to manipulate regulatory T cells to immunosuppress the host and so potentiate their own survival. For example, regulatory T cell activity has been reported to increase in several infectious contexts, such as retroviral infections (the most well-known of which is HIV), mycobacterial infections (e.g., tuberculosis), and various parasitic infections including &quot;Leishmania&quot; and malaria.

Treg cells play major roles during HIV infection. They suppress the immune system, thus limiting target cells and reducing inflammation, but this simultaneously disrupts the clearance of virus by the cell-mediated immune response and enhances the reservoir by pushing CD4+ T cells to a resting state, including infected cells. Additionally, Treg cells can be infected by HIV, increasing the size of the HIV reservoir directly. Thus, Treg cells are being investigated as targets for HIV cure research. Some Treg cell depletion strategies have been tested in SIV infected nonhuman primates, and shown to cause viral reactivation and enhanced SIV specific CD8+ T cell responses.

Regulatory T cells have a large role in the pathology of visceral leishmaniasis and in preventing excess inflammation in patients cured of visceral leishmaniasis.

=== ALS ===
There is some evidence that Treg cells may be dysfunctional and driving neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis due to lower expression of FOXP3. &quot;Ex vivo&quot; expansion of Treg cells for subsequent autologous transplant is currently being investigated after promising results were obtained in a phase I clinical trial.

=== Pregnancy ===
While regulatory T cells increase via polyclonal expansion both systemically and locally during healthy pregnancies to protect the fetus from the maternal immune response (a process called maternal immune tolerance), evidence suggests that this polyclonal expansion is impaired in preeclamptic mothers and their offspring. Research suggests reduced production and development of regulatory T cells during preeclampsia may degrade maternal immune tolerance, leading to the hyperactive immune response characteristic of preeclampsia.

=== Cancer ===

CD4+ regulatory T cells are often associated with solid tumours in both humans and murine models. Increased numbers of regulatory T cells in breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers is associated with a poorer prognosis.

CD70+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma B cells induce FOXP3 expression and regulatory function in intratumoral CD4+CD25− T cells.

Most tumors elicit an immune response in the host that is mediated by tumor antigens, thus distinguishing the tumor from other non-cancerous cells. This causes large numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to appear in the TME. These lymphocytes may target cancerous cells and therefore slow or terminate tumor development. However, this process is complicated because Treg cells seem to be preferentially trafficked to the TME. While Treg cells normally make up only about 4% of CD4+ T cells, they can make up as much as 20–30% of the CD4+ population around the TME.

The ratio of Treg to effector T cells in the TME is a determining factor in the success of the cancer immune response. High levels of Treg cells in the TME are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers, such as ovarian, breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer. This indicates that Treg cells suppress effector T cells and hinder the body&#x27;s immune response against the cancer. However, in some types of cancer the opposite is true, and high levels of Treg cells are associated with a positive prognosis. This trend is seen in cancers such as colorectal carcinoma and follicular lymphoma. This could be due to Treg cells&#x27; ability to suppress general inflammation, which is known to trigger cell proliferation and metastasis . These opposite effects indicate that Tr cells&#x27; role in the development of cancer is highly dependent on both type and location of the tumor.

Although it is still not entirely understood how Treg cells are preferentially trafficked to the TME, the chemotaxis is probably driven by the production of chemokines by the tumor. Treg infiltration into the TMEis facilitated by the binding of the chemokine receptor CCR4, which is expressed on Treg cells, to its ligand CCL22, which is secreted by many types of tumor cells. Treg cell expansion at the site of the tumor could also explain the increased levels of Treg cells. The cytokine, TGF-β, which is commonly produced by tumor cells, is known to induce the differentiation and expansion of Treg cells.

Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) as a transcription factor is an essential molecular marker of Treg cells. FOXP3 polymorphism (rs3761548) might be involved in the gastric cancer progression through influencing Treg function and the secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β.

Treg cells present in the TME  can be either induced Tregs or natural (thymic) Tregs which develop from naive precursors. However, tumor-associated Tregs may also originate from IL-17A+Foxp3+ Tregs which develop from Th17 cells.

In general, the immunosuppression of the TMEhas largely contributed to the unsuccessful outcomes of many cancer immunotherapy treatments. Depletion of Treg cells in animal models has shown an increased efficacy of immunotherapy treatments, and therefore, many immunotherapy treatments are now incorporating Treg depletion.

==== Cancer therapies targeting regulatory T lymphocytes ====
Tregs in the TME are abundantly effector Tregs that over-express immunosuppressive molecules such as CTLA-4. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies cause depletion of Tregs and thus increase CD8+ T cells effective against the tumor. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was approved for patients with advanced melanoma. Immune-checkpoint molecule PD-1 inhibits activation of both conventional T cells and Tregs and use of anti-PD-1 antibodies may lead to activation and immunosuppressive function of Tregs. Resistance to anti-PD-1-mAb treatment is probably caused by enhanced Treg cell activity. Rapid cancer progression upon PD-1 blockade is called hyperprogressive disease. Therapies targeting Treg suppression include anti-CD25 mAbs and anti-CCR4 mAbs. OX40 agonist and GITR agonists are currently being investigated. Therapy targeting TCR signaling is also possible by blocking tyrosine kinases. For example, tyrosine-kinase inhibitor dasatinib is used for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and is associated with Treg inhibition.

== Molecular characterization ==
Similar to other T cells, regulatory T cells develop in the thymus. The latest research suggests that regulatory T cells are defined by expression of the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP3 (forkhead box p3). Expression of FOXP3 is required for regulatory T cell development and appears to control a genetic program specifying this cell&#x27;s fate. The large majority of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells are found within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restricted CD4-expressing (CD4+) population and express high levels of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25). In addition to the FOXP3-expressing CD4+ CD25+, there also appears to be a minor population of MHC class I restricted CD8+ FOXP3-expressing regulatory T cells. These FOXP3-expressing CD8+ T cells do not appear to be functional in healthy individuals but are induced in autoimmune disease states by T cell receptor stimulation to suppress IL-17-mediated immune responses. Unlike conventional T cells, regulatory T cells do not produce IL-2 and are therefore anergic at baseline.

A number of different methods are employed in research to identify and monitor Treg cells. Originally, high expression of CD25 and CD4 surface markers was used (CD4+CD25+ cells). This is problematic as CD25 is also expressed on non-regulatory T cells in the setting of immune activation such as during an immune response to a pathogen. As defined by CD4 and CD25 expression, regulatory T cells comprise about 5–10% of the mature CD4+ T cell subpopulation in mice and humans, while about 1–2% of Treg can be measured in whole blood. The additional measurement of cellular expression of FOXP3 protein allowed a more specific analysis of Treg cells (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells). However, FOXP3 is also transiently expressed in activated human effector T cells, thus complicating a correct Treg analysis using CD4, CD25 and FOXP3 as markers in humans. Therefore, the gold standard surface marker combination to defined Tregs within unactivated CD3+CD4+ T cells is high CD25 expression combined with the absent or low-level expression of the surface protein CD127 (IL-7RA). If viable cells are not required then the addition of FOXP3 to the CD25 and CD127 combination will provide further stringency. Several additional markers have been described, e.g., high levels of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4) and GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) are also expressed on regulatory T cells, however the functional significance of this expression remains to be defined. There is a great interest in identifying cell surface markers that are uniquely and specifically expressed on all FOXP3-expressing regulatory T cells. However, to date no such molecule has been identified.

The identification of Tregs following cell activation is challenging as conventional T cells will express CD25, transiently express FOXP3 and lose CD127 expression upon activation. It has been shown that Tregs can be detected using an activation-induced marker assay by expression of CD39 in combination with co-expression of CD25 and OX40(CD134) which define antigen-specific cells following 24-48h stimulation with antigen.

In addition to the search for novel protein markers, a different method to analyze and monitor Treg cells more accurately has been described in the literature. This method is based on DNA methylation analysis. Only in Treg cells, but not in any other cell type, including activated effector T cells, a certain region within the gene (TSDR, Treg-specific-demethylated region) is found demethylated, which allows to monitor Treg cells through a PCR reaction or other DNA-based analysis methods.
Interplay between the Th17 cells and regulatory T cells are important in many diseases like respiratory diseases.

Recent evidence suggests that mast cells may be important mediators of Treg-dependent peripheral tolerance.

===Epitopes===
Regulatory T cell epitopes (&#x27;Tregitopes&#x27;) were discovered in 2008 and consist of linear sequences of amino acids contained within monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Since their discovery, evidence has indicated Tregitopes may be crucial to the activation of natural regulatory T cells.

Potential applications of regulatory T cell epitopes have been hypothesised: tolerisation to transplants, protein drugs, blood transfer therapies, and type I diabetes as well as reduction of immune response for the treatment of allergies.

==Genetic deficiency==
Genetic mutations in the gene encoding FOXP3 have been identified in both humans and mice based on the heritable disease caused by these mutations. This disease provides the most striking evidence that regulatory T cells play a critical role in maintaining normal immune system function. Humans with mutations in FOXP3 develop a severe and rapidly fatal autoimmune disorder known as Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome.

The IPEX syndrome is characterized by the development of overwhelming systemic autoimmunity in the first year of life, resulting in the commonly observed triad of watery diarrhea, eczematous dermatitis, and endocrinopathy seen most commonly as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Most individuals have other autoimmune phenomena including Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune neutropenia, and tubular nephropathy. The majority of affected males die within the first year of life of either metabolic derangements or sepsis. An analogous disease is also observed in a spontaneous FOXP3-mutant mouse known as &quot;scurfy&quot;.

<text>4 Poofs and a Piano are a British comedy band formed in 2000. They were the house band on the BBC One chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; throughout the show&#x27;s run from 2001 to 2010.

== History ==
The band performed their first gig at the Groucho Club. Since then, they have also performed at many corporate events, as well as Pride events and music festivals – including the Edinburgh Festival, Perth Festival, the Brighton Festival Fringe and Glastonbury Festival.

The band featured on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got More Talent&quot;, and appeared on &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot;.

In 2009, the band featured in &quot;The Impressions Show with Culshaw and Stephenson&quot;, in a spoof &quot;Ross Kemp on Gangs&quot; episode, with Culshaw pretending to be Ross Kemp and Jonathan Ross.

==&quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;==

Ross introduced the band each Friday night with an innuendo-laden joke directed at homosexuality, or the supposed sex lives of gay men. As each guest moved from the green room to the studio, the band played a cover version of a song related to the guest or their field of work. Their camp performance was often highly exaggerated in its stereotypical cabaret manner.

Each week a guest was singled out for special attention by the band who wore specially printed T-shirts featuring the guest&#x27;s face. This was usually a privilege bestowed upon the guest most deemed a cult figure or gay icon.

In an October 2009 episode of the show with Tim Minchin as a guest, he performed a song called &quot;5 Poofs and 2 Pianos&quot;, in which he humorously suggested he undergo reverse conversion therapy and join the quartet with his own piano.

== Band members ==
* Stephen De Martin – Vocals
* Ian Parkin – Vocals
* Duane Gooden – Vocals
* David Roper – Piano and vocals

<text>Cape Colville is the northernmost point of the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It lies 85 kilometres north of Thames, and 70 kilometres northeast of the city of Auckland, on the other side of the Hauraki Gulf. The small settlements of Port Jackson and Fletcher Bay lie immediately to the west and east respectively of the cape.

Great Barrier Island lies to the north of Cape Colville, separated from it by 20-kilometre width of the Colville Channel. The tiny Channel Island lies between the two.

== Port Jackson ==
Port Jackson Bay, just to the south of the Cape, has been inhabited since at least the fifteenth century. At the south end of the Bay, at Port Jackson, a water-powered flax mill existed in 1901, when the population was just 12. There is a camp site. New Zealand dotterel (&quot;Anarhynchus obscurus&quot;), a species of plover, breed locally. Boneseed is a local weed. Dune restoration with spinifex was done from 2009 to 2011. There was much flooding in 2014. Killer whales (orca) inhabit the waters offshore, where they specialise in hunting eagle rays.

==History==
CJ Cheil Jedang was founded as &#x27;Cheil Jedang&#x27; in August 1953 as a sugar and flour manufacturer and was originally part of Samsung Group, as their first manufacturing business. In July 1993 it spun off from Samsung and gained independent management, changing into a life and culture group with the entrance into the food service and entertainment industries. In 1996 it became the &#x27;Cheil Jedang Group&#x27; with the official separation from Samsung Group completed in February 1997.

In October 2002 the CJ Group was launched and the official name changed to &#x27;CJ Co., Ltd&#x27;. In September 2007 CJ Co., Ltd. again spun off as a business holding company and renamed &#x27;CJ CheilJedang Co., Ltd&#x27; and CJ Group became a holding company for a group of food and entertainment-related subsidiaries based in South Korea. It has four main core businesses: Food &amp; Food Service, Bio Pharma, Entertainment and Media, and Home Shopping &amp; Logistics; and CJ Cheil Jedang was put under Food &amp; Food Service.

In 2018, CJ CheilJedang acquired Kahiki Foods, an American food manufacturing company based in Columbus, Ohio. In 2019, CJ CheilJedang acquired Schwan&#x27;s Company, a food manufacturing company based in Minnesota, United States.

==Businesses==
Its four main business areas are food ingredients (including sugar, wheat, and oil), food (ambient, chilled and frozen food including HMR products), logistics, and biotechnology (including MSG, lysine), processed food and animal feed.

It has since expanded globally with offices in the U.S., China, Vietnam, Japan, and Germany. CJ packaged food products are currently exported to more than 100 countries.

<doc id="1171713" wikidata="Q855809" url="?curid=1171713" title="Cerezo Osaka">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Osaka. The club currently plays in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country. The club&#x27;s name &quot;Cerezo&quot; (Spanish for cherry blossom) is also the flower of the city of Osaka. The official hometowns of the club are Osaka and Sakai. There exists a local rivalry rivalry with Suita-based Gamba Osaka.

== History ==
=== Beginnings (1957–1992) ===
The club, originally called Yanmar Diesel, started in 1957 as the company team of Yanmar and was an original founder (&quot;Original Eight&quot;) of the now-disbanded Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965. With four Japanese league titles to its credit, it was a mainstay of the JSL Division 1 until 1990 when it was first relegated, and joined the former Japan Football League (JFL) in 1992.

=== Privatised and registered under a new name (1993–&quot;present&quot;) ===
In 1993, the club incorporated as Osaka Football Club Co., Ltd. and adopted the name Cerezo Osaka after a public contest. In 1994, they won the Japan Football League championship and was promoted to the J1 League in 1995. This also coincided with a run to the finals of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, which they lost to Bellmare Hiratsuka.

Cerezo has been relegated from J1 to J2 on three occasions, but are currently playing in the J1 league. The club had an impressive third-place finish in the 2017 season.

==== Taste of silverware ====
On 4 November 2017, Cerezo won the 2017 J.League Cup, the first major title in their club history, defeating Kawasaki Frontale 2–0.

On 1 January 2018, Cerezo won the 2017 Emperor&#x27;s Cup, securing their second major title. The final match was against Yokohama F. Marinos, where Cerezo won 2–1 in extra time with Kota Mizunuma scoring the winner.

On 10 February 2018, Cerezo won the 2018 Japanese Super Cup winning 3–2 against Kawasaki Frontale.

In May 2018, the club changed its incorporated name from Osaka Football Club Co., Ltd. to Cerezo Osaka Co., Ltd.

In 2022, the club got close to winning the J.League Cup for their second title, but blew a 1–0 lead to Sanfrecce Hiroshima in injury time after Hiroshima player Pieros Sotiriou scored two goals in the 96th and 101st minutes of the match to give the opponent the J.League Cup.

On 1 February 2023, Cerezo signed former Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United player, Shinji Kagawa on a two-years contract.

== Stadiums ==
The hometowns of the club are Osaka and Sakai. The club plays at the Yodoko Sakura Stadium, with some bigger matches played at the Yanmar Stadium Nagai.

The club practices at Minami Tsumori Sakura Sports Park, Maishima Sports Island, and Amagasaki Yanmar Diesel Ground.

== Mascots ==
The club&#x27;s mascots are a wolf named Lobby (from Spanish &quot;lobo&quot;, meaning wolf) and Madame Lobina, Lobby&#x27;s mother. On February 22, 2020, host and TV personality Roland was appointed Cerezo&#x27;s &quot;Official CereMan&quot;.

== Rivalries ==
Cerezo&#x27;s biggest rival is fellow Osaka club Gamba Osaka. The matches played between Cerezo and Gamba are referred to as the Osaka derby.

== Kits and colours ==
Cerezo&#x27;s club colour is pink, like the cherry blossoms that the club&#x27;s name is based on. Combination colours have been navy blue and black. This year, the uniform colour is pink (home) and white (away) for the outfield players and black (home), pink (away) and green for the goalkeepers.

During the Yanmar Diesel days in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, the uniform was all-red reminiscent of Deportivo Toluca.

<text>Colville (Māori: Te Umanga-wha-o-nga-waka), a small town in the north of the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand, lies 26 kilometres north of Coromandel in Colville Bay on the Hauraki Gulf, and is the northernmost town of any note on the peninsula. North of Colville, 28 kilometres of rough road lead to the small settlement of Port Jackson, close to the peninsula&#x27;s northwesternmost point, Cape Colville and 20 km to Port Charles on the northeastern side.

The town is the service and social centre for the area, with a co-operatively-owned general store, cafe, Postal Delivery Centre, volunteer fire brigade, school, community hall and several houses. Just beyond the town is the beginning of the Te Moehau Range, which forms the bulk of the northern end of the Coromandel Peninsula, and contains valuable ecological areas, including a population of the threatened North Island brown kiwi.

Colville the town took its name from the cape, which Captain James Cook named on 18 November 1769 after Rear Admiral Lord Colville, under whom Cook had previously served (1759–1761) on HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; in the Royal Navy. Colville was also known as Cabbage Bay, thought to be in reference to the cabbage trees in the bay.

Colville township grew following the construction of a general store with a motor garage alongside. This was built by Richard (Dick) Goudie, a local man whose grandparents had settled in Cabbage Bay. Dick Goudie later ran a taxi service from the town, being the first to drive a motor vehicle across the new bridge at Papa Aroha which opened up the northern peninsula from Coromandel. Fossicking for semi-precious stones such as carnelian and for kauri gum are popular activities among tourists visiting the town.

Another member of the Goudie family, John, developed a motor camp a few kilometres north of the town some years later.

The Motukawao Islands lie five kilometres off the coast to the southwest of Colville, in the Hauraki Gulf.

The combined company adopted the Chubb name in January 2016 after the acquisition was completed.

==History==
===Chubb===
In 1882, Thomas Caldecot Chubb and his son Percy started a marine underwriting business in New York City. They collected $1,000 from 100 prominent merchants and focused on insuring ships and cargoes.

The Chubb Corporation was incorporated in 1967 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984.

Beginning in 1970, the corporation owned The Chubb Institute, a chain of commercial technical schools which grew out of the company&#x27;s employee training program, but the schools were sold for $1 to a partnership of private equity firms Great Hill Partners and the High-Tech Institute in 2004.

In 2007, Chubb was named the Readers&#x27; Choice winner as &quot;Best Admitted Property/Casualty Insurance Company&quot; by &quot;Business Insurance&quot;. In 2010 Chubb was number five on Chicago Business &quot;Best Places to Work&quot; list.

===ACE Limited===
====1985–1999====
ACE (American Casualty Excess) Limited was established in 1985 in response to the U.S. liability insurance crisis of the mid-1980s. It was formed with the assistance of insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan and funded by a group of 34 U.S. companies seeking difficult-to-obtain Excess Liability and Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) insurance coverage. That year, ACE and its Bermuda subsidiary, incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, wrote its first insurance policy with John Cox as its president and CEO. In 1987 the company assumed management of Corporate Officers &amp; Directors Assurance Limited (CODA), expanding ACE Bermuda&#x27;s product line.

Walter Scott became Chairman, President, and CEO of ACE in 1990 and saw the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993. Brian Duperreault succeeded Scott in 1994 as Chairman, President &amp; CEO and worked for the next ten years as ACE went through a series of acquisitions and a diversification process that brought the ACE Group of Companies global status. One of the multiple acquisitions made during this time was the global property and casualty business of Cigna Corporation (most significantly the Insurance Company of North America, known as INA), which was purchased for $3.45 billion in 1999.

====2000–2021====
In 2004, Evan G. Greenberg became president and CEO of ACE Ltd. In 2004, ACE was also investigated by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for participating in a bid rigging and price fixing scheme with insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan.

In 2008, ACE purchased the accident and health insurance provider Combined Insurance Company of America (founded by W. Clement Stone in 1919) from Aon Corporation for $2.56 billion and the high-net-worth personal lines business of the Atlantic Companies.

Also in 2008, ACE relocated from the Cayman Islands to Zürich, Switzerland. Evan Greenberg described the move as a &quot;natural progression&quot; that would provide ACE with a &quot;better strategic flexibility…and a solid legal and regulatory environment…&quot; The re-domestication was completed in July that year.

In 2010, the ACE company ESIS Inc. was hired by BP to process claims made by the victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

In 2010, ACE Limited purchased Rain and Hail, LLC for $1.1 billion. Rain and Hail Insurance Service, headquartered in Johnston, Iowa, is an industry leader in crop insurance in the United States. ACE Limited also acquired the Hong Kong and Korea life insurance operations of New York Life.

In 2011, ACE Limited purchased agribusiness insurer Penn Millers.
In 2012, they purchased Indonesian insurer Asuransi Jaya Proteksi.
In 2013, they purchased Mexican Surety Lines Company Fianzas Monterrey and Mexican Personal Lines Insurer ABA Seguros.
In April 2014, ACE Limited acquired a majority stake in Siam Commercial Samaggi Insurance PCL from Siam Commercial Bank. Following a subsequent tender offer in June 2014, ACE and its local partner owned 93.03% of the Samaggi.

In October 2014, ACE Limited acquired the large commercial property and casualty business of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA. The transaction made ACE the largest property and casualty insurer in Brazil.
In April 2015, ACE Limited acquired the Fireman&#x27;s Fund high net-worth personal lines insurance business in the U.S. from Allianz for $365 million. ACE Private Risk Services is one of the largest high net worth insurers in the U.S.

On 1 September 2020, Chubb announced the introduction of the latest update of its Enterprise Guard Plus product for the emerging needs of Hong Kong business insurance.

In February 2021, Chubb Limited and the World Health Organization announced the roll out of a no-fault compensation scheme for COVID-19 vaccinations for low and middle-income countries.

===ACE acquires Chubb===
On 1 July 2015, ACE announced that it would acquire Chubb Corporation for $28.3 billion in cash and ACE stock. Upon completion, ACE shareholders held 70% while Chubb shareholders got 30% of the new combined company. The new company was to be based in Zürich, where ACE Limited&#x27;s headquarters were. Evan Greenberg of ACE became the Chairman and CEO of the new company, while Chubb Chairman and CEO John Finnegan became Executive Vice Chairman for North America External Affairs. The company&#x27;s board was expanded to 18, with 4 of them coming from Chubb. The new combined company then decided to adopt the Chubb name. The deal received ACE and Chubb shareholder approval and all required regulatory approval, and closed on 14 January 2016.

==Controversies==

===2004 Eliot Spitzer investigation===
In 2004 New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer conducted an investigation in the insurance industry. ACE, American International Group (AIG), Marsh &amp; McLennan, and other large insurers and brokerages were named in Spitzer&#x27;s investigation for possibly participating in questionable insurance practices including the payment of contingent commissions, bid-rigging, price-fixing, and improper accounting.
Spitzer asserted that contingent commissions contributed to a widespread practice of &quot;bid-rigging&quot; where brokers solicited fake bids with deliberately less favorable terms for the consumer than the bid offered by the insurance company paying the highest commissions.

As part of an $80 million settlement that abated further inquiry, ACE signed an Assurance of Discontinuance in which they acknowledged their prior conduct and agreed to alter their business practices. Evan Greenberg himself admitted no fault in Spitzer&#x27;s allegations although a junior executive did plead guilty to criminal charges.

Spitzer&#x27;s insurance industry probe additionally looked in early 2005 into ACE Ltd&#x27;s subsidiary ACE Tempest Re&#x27;s reporting to the SEC of a series of reinsurance transactions, together with the SEC reporting of a further 16 unaffiliated re-insurers. Evan Greenberg said that his company&#x27;s investigation should be completed within a month. According to Greenberg, contracts appeared &quot;generally structured in a way to provide for appropriate risk transfer and accounted for properly.&quot;

The Spitzer investigations also triggered civil litigation by policyholders who claim they were victimized by the bid rigging and commission schemes.

===Securing bond for Donald Trump defamation appeal===
On 8 March 2024, Federal Insurance Company, part of The Chubb Corporation, posted a $91.63 million bond for Donald Trump in the &quot;E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump&quot; case. Despite an estimated net worth of over $2 billion, Trump needed a cash bond posted by Chubb in order to secure his appeal. While President, Trump appointed Chubb CEO Evan G. Greenberg to the White House advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations. When Chubb announced the securing of the bond, they claimed that this would be the only bond secured as Trump has another $454 million bond pending for his New York civil fraud case. On 18 March 2024, Trump&#x27;s lawyers notified the Appellate Division of Manhattan Supreme Court that he was unable to secure a bond for the civil fraud case, seeming to confirm Chubb&#x27;s position on not underwriting additional bonds for Trump.

On 13 March 2024, CEO Evan Greenberg issued a letter to investors, customers, and brokers defending the move. Despite having deep personal connections to Trump, Greenberg claimed &quot;we frankly left our own personal feelings aside&quot; when deciding to issue the bond.

<doc id="1171735" wikidata="Q2706137" url="?curid=1171735" title="The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll">
<text>&quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&quot; is a topical song written by the American musician Bob Dylan. Recorded on October 23, 1963, the song was released on Dylan&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot; and gives a generally factual account of the killing of a 51-year-old African-American barmaid, Hattie Carroll (née Curtis; March 3, 1911 – February 9, 1963), by then 24-year-old William Devereux &quot;Billy&quot; Zantzinger (February 7, 1939 – January 3, 2009), a young man from a wealthy white tobacco farming family in Charles County, Maryland, and of his subsequent sentence to six months in a county jail, after being convicted of assault.

The melody of the chorus is largely taken from a folk song called &quot;Mary Hamilton&quot;. The lyrics are a commentary on 1960s racism. When Carroll was killed in 1963, Charles County was still strictly segregated by race in public facilities such as restaurants, churches, theaters, doctor&#x27;s offices, buses and the county fair. The schools of Charles County were not integrated until 1967.

==Killing==
The main incident described in the song took place in the early hours of February 9, 1963, at the white tie Spinsters&#x27; Ball at the Emerson Hotel in Baltimore. Using a toy cane, Zantzinger drunkenly assaulted at least three of the Emerson Hotel workers: a bellboy, a waitress, and — at about 1:30 in the morning of the 9th — Carroll, a 51-year-old barmaid. According to the song, Carroll &quot;had borne 10 children&quot;, though other accounts range from 8 to 11. She was president of a black social club.

Already drunk before he got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6&#x27;2&quot; Zantzinger had assaulted employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters&#x27; Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a &quot;nigger&quot; and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a &quot;nigger&quot;, then &quot;you black son of a bitch&quot;, and struck her on the shoulder and across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: &quot;He asked for a drink and called her &#x27;a black bitch&#x27;, and &#x27;black s.o.b&#x27;. She replied, &#x27;Just a moment&#x27; and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck.&quot; She handed him his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.

Within five minutes from the time of the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, &quot;I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.&quot; The barmaid and another employee helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963.

Zantzinger was initially charged with murder. His defense was that he had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to have no memory of the attack. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and assault, based on the likelihood that it was her stress reaction to his verbal and physical abuse that led to the intracranial bleeding, rather than blunt-force trauma from the blow that left no lasting mark. On August 28, Zantzinger was convicted of both charges and sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment. &quot;Time&quot; magazine covered the sentencing:

After the sentence was announced, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; conjectured he was given a sentence that short to keep him out of the largely black state prison, reasoning his notoriety would make him a target for abuse there. Zantzinger served his time in the comparative safety of the Washington County county jail, some from the scene of the crime. In September, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; quoted Zantzinger on his sentence: &quot;I&#x27;ll just miss a lot of snow.&quot; His then-wife, Jane, was quoted saying, &quot;Nobody treats his niggers as well as Billy does around here.&quot;

==Song==
Zantzinger was convicted of manslaughter on August 28, 1963, and was not tried by a jury of peers but by a panel of three judges. The sentence was handed down on the same day that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Bob Dylan, aged 22 at that time, was one of the celebrities at the march and on the journey home to New York City he read about the conviction of Zantzinger and decided to write a protest song about the case. According to a 1991 &quot;Washington Post&quot; report, Dylan wrote the song in Manhattan, sitting in an all-night cafe. A radio documentary on the song said rather that he wrote it both in New York and at the home of his then-lover, Joan Baez, in Carmel. According to Nancy Carlin, a friend of Baez who visited: &quot;He would stand in this cubbyhole, beautiful view across the hills, and peck type on an old typewriter... there was an old piano up at Joan&#x27;s... and peck piano playing... up until noon he would drink black coffee then switch over to red wine, quit about five or six.&quot; He recorded it on October 23, 1963, when the trial was still relatively fresh news, and incorporated it into his live repertoire immediately, before releasing the studio version on February 10, 1964. 

The song juxtaposes Zantzinger&#x27;s wealth and connections with the brevity of that sentence. Despite the song&#x27;s topical nature, Dylan has continued to perform it in concert as of May 2009. His live-audience renditions of it appear on the albums &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; (2002; recorded November 21, 1975), &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall&quot; (2004; recorded October 31, 1964), and &quot;Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections&quot; (2018; recorded October 26, 1963). In 2019, five live performances of the song from the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour were released on the box set &quot;The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings&quot;.

In &quot;&quot;, Dylan includes &quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&quot; in a list of his early songs which he feels were influenced by his introduction to the work of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. He describes writing out the words of &quot;Pirate Jenny&quot; (or &quot;The Black Freighter&quot;) in order to understand how the Brecht–Weill song achieved its effect. Dylan writes: &quot;Woody had never written a song like that. It wasn&#x27;t a protest or a topical song and there was no love for people in it. I took the song apart and unzipped it—it was the free verse association, the structure and disregard for the known certainty of melodic pattern to make it seriously matter, give it its cutting edge. It also had the ideal chorus for the lyrics.&quot;

Literary critic Christopher Ricks considers the song to be &quot;one of Dylan&#x27;s greatest&quot; and the recording on &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;&quot; to be &quot;perfect&quot;. He devotes an entire chapter to it, analyzing both the meaning as well as the prosody in his book on Dylan&#x27;s songs as poetry. &quot;But here is a song that could not be written better.&quot;

Dylan&#x27;s song (&quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&quot;) contains at least two inaccuracies. Zantzinger was not booked for first degree murder, but for second degree murder. Dylan also misspells and mispronounces Zantzinger&#x27;s surname as &quot;Zanzinger&quot;.

==Impact on Zantzinger==
After serving his sentence for manslaughter, Zantzinger returned to running the farm in Charles County and began selling real estate. He moved to more urban Waldorf, Maryland, still within Charles County. Eventually he moved to a home in Port Tobacco, where he lived throughout the 1990s until moving to a new home in St. Mary&#x27;s County around 2001 in Chaptico, Maryland, called Bachelor&#x27;s Hope.

In addition to federal tax delinquencies, Zantzinger fell more than $18,000 behind on county taxes on properties he owned in two Charles County communities called Patuxent Woods and Indian Head, shanties he leased to poor blacks. In 1986, the same year the IRS ruled against him, Charles County confiscated those properties. Nonetheless, Zantzinger continued to collect rents, raise rents, and even successfully prosecute his putative tenants for back rent. In June 1991, Zantzinger was initially charged with a single count of &quot;deceptive trade practices&quot;. After some delay, Zantzinger pleaded guilty to 50 misdemeanor counts of unfair and deceptive trade practices. He was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a $50,000 fine. Some of his prison sentence was served in a work release program.

In 2001, Zantzinger discussed the song with Howard Sounes for &quot;Down the Highway, the Life of Bob Dylan&quot;. He dismissed the song as a &quot;total lie&quot; and claimed &quot;It&#x27;s actually had no effect upon my life&quot;, but expressed scorn for Dylan, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s a no-account son of a bitch; he&#x27;s just like a scum of a scum bag of the earth. I should have sued him and put him in jail.&quot;

William &quot;Billy&quot; Zantzinger died in Charlotte Hall, Maryland, on January 3, 2009, at the age of 69.

<text>The Motukawao Islands are the northernmost of several small groups of islands that lie in the Hauraki Gulf off the west coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. They lie some to the southwest of Colville, and are uninhabited. The largest of the islands are Motuwi and Ngamotukaraka Islands; others include Moturua and Motukaramarama Islands.

Motukaramarama Island lies some off the coast and is uninhabited. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a nesting site for about 3500 pairs of Australasian gannets.

<doc id="1171739" wikidata="Q3820436" url="?curid=1171739" title="Kasaï region">
<text>The Kasaï region (also referred to as the Greater Kasaï region, Greater Kasaï, Grand Kasaï, or simply Kasaï) is a geographic and cultural region in south-central Democratic Republic of the Congo. Once a single province, it now comprises the provinces of Kasaï Province, Kasaï-Central, Sankuru, Kasaï-Oriental, and Lomami Province. It shares its name with the Kasai River.

Historically, the Kasaï region has been a stronghold for the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party. As an opposition stronghold, it experienced both political and economic marginalization by the central government. This long-running resentment of the central government&#x27;s remoteness and corruption exploded into a rebellion, triggered by the official rejection of a local chief, Kamwina Nsapu, who in August 2016 was killed by security forces. After UDPS candidate Félix Tshisekedi&#x27;s victory in the 2018 presidential election, most militia members surrendered and returned to their communities of origin.

Until 2015 Kasai region was divided administratively into two provinces, Kasai-Occidental and Kasai-Oriental. After 2015, the former Districts within these provinces were in some cases combined with cities that had been independently administered, and their status was elevated to the five current provinces.

==2017 rebellion==

In spring 2017, long-running resentment of central government&#x27;s remoteness and corruption exploded into a rebellion, triggered by official rejection of a local chief, Kamwina Nsapu, who in August was killed by security forces. In the fighting that followed, nearly 1.4 million people were displaced, among them around 850,000 children, leading to a hunger crisis across the region as subsistence farmers were unable to plant crops.

<text>Sanfrecce Hiroshima () is a Japanese professional football club based in Hiroshima. The club competes in the J1 League, top flight of the Japanese football league system. Sanfrecce is one of the most successful clubs in Japan. The club is the joint fourth in most J1 League titles with three, the joint first in most top-flight titles (which includes the defunct Japan Soccer League), with eight, and the club with the most participations in Emperor&#x27;s Cup finals, with 15.

Sanfrecce have won 3 J1 League title, 3 Emperor&#x27;s Cup, 1 J.League Cup and 4 Japanese Super Cup. Internationally, the club has made two appearances in the FIFA Club World Cup with their most recent appearance being in the 2015 edition.

==History==

=== 1938–1991 ===
The club was a former company team of in 1938 and played in the semi-professional Japan Soccer League.

The club was an original founder (&quot;Original Eight&quot;) of the now-disbanded Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965. They dominated the JSL&#x27;s early years, winning the title 4 times in a row – a feat that was later equaled by Yomiuri SC/Verdy Kawasaki. The name change was made at in 1981. 

During the 1969 season, they participated in the Asian Club Cup, forerunner to today&#x27;s AFC Champions League; at the time, the tournament was done in a single locale (in that year it was Bangkok, Thailand), and they ended up in third place, the first participation of a Japanese club in the continental tournament. This also cost them the league title to Mitsubishi/Urawa, and although they won another title in 1970, since then the club has been out of the running for the title, with exceptional seasons such as 1994 when they won runner-up.

The Toyo Industries that became the first JSL champions also completed the first double by taking the Emperor&#x27;s Cup. They were also the first of three &quot;Invincibles&quot;, undefeated champion clubs in Japan (the others were Mitsubishi in 1969 and Yamaha in 1987–88), although only Toyo completed a double.

Ogi Matsumoto and Yasuyuki Kuwahara went on to win the 1968 Olympic bronze medal for the Japan national team.

=== 1992–present ===
When JSL disbanded and became the J.League in 1992, it dropped the company name and became Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Alongside JEF United Ichihara Chiba and Urawa Red Diamonds they co-founded both leagues (&quot;Original Ten&quot;).

===First League title===

In 2002, Sanfrecce became the first former stage winner (first stage, 1994) to be relegated to the lower division, J2 League. But it only spent a year there, finishing second the very next season to regain promotion back to J1. The club finished 16th in the 2007 season and were relegated to J2 League after they were beaten by Kyoto Sanga in the promotion/relegation play-off. In the following season in 2008, Sanfrecce nevertheless won the J2 League title at the first attempt, having 84 points (a difference of 25 points with the runner-up clubs) with six matches left.

By virtue of earning fourth place in the 2009 season and Gamba Osaka retaining the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, Sanfrecce qualified for the 2010 AFC Champions League where they were knocked out in the group stage.

=== Back-to-back league title ===
On 24 November 2012, Sanfrecce defeated Cerezo Osaka 4–1 to seal their first ever J1 league title with 64 points thus qualifying to the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup as host and also qualifying to the 2013 AFC Champions League. Three individual awards was given individually with Hajime Moriyasu winning the &#x27;Manager of the Year&#x27; award and Hisato Satō winning both the &#x27;Most Valuable Player&#x27; award and the &#x27;Top Scorer&#x27; award with 22 goals. Sanfreece players Shusaku Nishikawa, Hiroki Mizumoto, Toshihiro Aoyama, Yojiro Takahagi and Hisato Satō was included in the 2012 &#x27;Best Eleven&#x27; of the season. Sanfreece then played in the FIFA Club World Cup play-off in December where Toshihiro Aoyama scored the only goal against OFC Champions League winners Auckland City to send the team to the quarter-finals. However, Sanfreece suffered a 2–1 defeat to CAF Champions League winners Al Ahly thus failing to qualified to the semi-finals and having the need to play for a 5th place where Sanfreece face AFC Champions League winners Ulsan Hyundai where the team won 3–2.

Sanfrecce then started off the 2013 season in the Japanese Super Cup on 23 February 2013 against 2012 Emperor&#x27;s Cup winners Kashiwa Reysol. where Hisato Satō scored the only goal in the match to lift the cup. However in the 2013 AFC Champions League, Sanfrecce suffered a rock bottom group stage finished with only 3 points thus being knock out. On 7 December 2013, Sanfrecce defeated Kashima Antlers 2–0, securing their second J1 League title with 63 points following a thrilling finish to the season which saw first-place Yokohama F. Marinos losing their final league game ending with 62 points, handing Sanfrecce the title. With their second consecutive title win, Sanfrecce became the second club to successfully defend their crown since Kashima Antlers in 2009. Sanfreecce then qualified to the 2014 AFC Champions League.

Sanfrecce started off the 2014 season on 22 February 2014 during the Japanese Super Cup against 2013 Emperor&#x27;s Cup winners Yokohama F. Marinos where Gakuto Notsuda and Takuma Asano went on to score the goal to secure a 2–0 win. In the 2014 AFC Champions League, Sanfrecce finished as runners-up in the group stage thus seeing the club advance to the round of 16 for the first time in the club history. Sanfreecce was drawn against Australian club Western Sydney Wanderers where the match ended up in a 3–3 aggerate however, due to away goal rules, the club was knocked out to the eventual cup winners.

During the 2015 season proved to be a great year for Sanfrecce, finishing 1st in the 2nd half of the season, then finishing 1st overall, just 2 points above Urawa Red Diamonds, to win their third J1 League title thus qualifying and representing Japan in that year&#x27;s FIFA Club World Cup. The club started off playing in the play-off round where they won against OFC Champions League winners Auckland City 2–0 thus qualifying to the quarter-finals facing off against CAF Champions League winners TP Mazembe where Sanfrecce won them 3–0 advancing to the semi-finals to play against the Copa Libertadores winners River Plate. The club ended up losing the match 1–0 where they would ended up playing for a 3rd placing match against Chinese side Guanzhou Evergrande where Sanfrecce won 2–1 to finished in third place.

In the 2018 season, after Sanfrecce progressively trailing towards a J1 League title, as it led the standings after Round 5, the club fell down to 2nd-place at the end of the season. The club saw Kawasaki Frontale win the league as Sanfrecce lost four of their last five league matches.

In 2022, the club was relieved to experience another good season, under the management of newly appointed German coach Michael Skibbe. Underrated by many because of the previous season, the club fought for the title at every competition it played until the very end. The Violas finished 3rd place at the J1 League, as runners-up to J2 club Ventforet Kofu in the Emperor&#x27;s Cup final, and as J.League Cup champions. The J.League Cup was won in dramatic fashion against Cerezo Osaka, as the club managed to comeback from a 1–0 loss with two goals scored by mid-season Cypriot signing Pieros Sotiriou. Both goals came very late in the match, being scored at the 96th and 101st minute of the match, during the added time of the second half. For his efforts to make the team competitive at every competition Sanfrecce partook in, Skibbe won J.League Manager of the Year, the club&#x27;s 4th &#x27;Manager of the Year&#x27; award.

On 20 June 2024, AFC confirmed Sanfrecce will participate in the inaugural 2024–25 AFC Champions League Two group stage, marking their first appearance in a second-tier continental competition. Sanfreece is then drawn in Group E alongside Australian club Sydney FC, Philippines club Kaya–Iloilo and Hong Kong club Eastern. On 19 September, Sanfreece make their debut in the tournament by playing Kaya–Iloilo at home winning them 3–0. Sanfrecce went on to top the group stage with 5 wins and 1 draw which come against Kaya–Iloilo in a 1–1 away draw in Manila. Sanfrecce then face Vietnamese club Nam Định in the round of 16 where Sanfrecce defeated them with a 7–0 aggregate to qualify to the quarter-finals facing off against Singaporean side Lion City Sailors.In the 2024 season, Sanfrecce finished the league as runners-up with 4 points short away from league winners but the club sees themselves qualifying to the 2025–26 AFC Champions League Elite.

<text>Westley Sissel Unseld Sr. (March 14, 1946June 2, 2020) was an American professional basketball player, coach and executive. He spent his entire National Basketball Association (NBA) career with the Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets. Unseld played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals and was selected with the second overall pick by the Bullets in the 1968 NBA draft. He was named the NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Rookie of the Year during his rookie season and joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players in NBA history to accomplish the feat. Unseld won an NBA championship with the Bullets in 1978, and the Finals MVP award to go with it. After retiring from playing in 1981, he worked with the Bullets/Wizards as a vice president, head coach, and general manager.

Unseld was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988 and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. His son, Wes Unseld Jr., is currently an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls.

==Early life==
Unseld was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Charles and Cornelia Unseld as one of nine children. His father was a prizefighter, construction worker, oilman, and baseball player for the Indianapolis Clowns.

Unseld starred for the Seneca High School team that won Kentucky state championships in 1963 and 1964. He was recruited by over 100 colleges, and became the first African-American athlete to be offered an athletic scholarship to the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Integration leaders in Louisville tried to persuade Unseld to attend the University of Kentucky and stated that &quot;it would be good for Kentucky and the Southeastern Conference,&quot; but Unseld opted to stay in town and attend the University of Louisville, which was racially integrated.

==College career==

Unseld played center for the school&#x27;s freshman team and averaged 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds over 14 games. He lettered for Louisville as a sophomore (1965–66), junior (1966–67), and senior (1967–68), scored 1,686 points (20.6 average) and grabbed 1,551 rebounds (18.9 average) over 82 games. He led the Missouri Valley Conference in rebounding all three years.

Unseld earned NCAA All-American honors in 1967 and 1968 and led Louisville to a 60–22 record during his collegiate career, making trips to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1966 and the NCAA tournament in 1967 and 1968. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Professional career==

Unseld was selected as the second overall pick by the Baltimore Bullets in the 1968 NBA draft. He was also selected by his hometown Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in the 1968 ABA draft. Unseld was offered contracts by both teams but opted to sign with the Bullets of the more successful NBA despite them allegedly offering less money. After signing Unseld, Bullets owner Earl Foreman proclaimed that &quot;this contract represents the most attractive and rewarding contract that has or will be signed by any player in the NBA this year.&quot;

In his first regular season game, Unseld recorded eight points and 22 rebounds in a 124–116 Baltimore win over the Detroit Pistons. On October 19, Unseld recorded his first double-double of his career after recording 13 points and 20 rebounds in a 124–121 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 22, Unseld recorded 20 points and a career-high 29 rebounds in a 121–110 loss to the 76ers.

As a rookie, Unseld helped lead the Bullets (which had finished in last place in the Eastern division the previous year) to a record and a division title. Unseld averaged 18.2 rebounds per game that year, and joined fellow future Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain to become the second player ever to win the Rookie of the Year Award and the Most Valuable Player Award in the same year. Unseld was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, and also claimed the &quot;Sporting News&quot; MVP that year.

Unseld was one of the best defensive players of his era, and in the , he led the NBA in rebounding. The following season, he led the NBA in field goal percentage with a .561 percentage.

First with star ball-handler Earl Monroe and renowned two-way player Gus Johnson, and later with dominant center-turned-power-forward Elvin Hayes and experienced wing Bob Dandridge, Unseld played a key role in the Bullets making four NBA Finals appearances from 1971 to 1979, and won the championship in 1978 over the Seattle SuperSonics, in which he was named the Finals MVP. He ended his playing career in March 1981, and his No. 41 jersey was retired by the Bullets shortly thereafter.

==Player profile==
Famed for his rebounding, bone-jarring picks and ability to ignite a fast break with his crisp, accurate outlet passes, Unseld made up for his lack of height as a center with brute strength and sheer determination. In 984 NBA games – all with the Bullets – Unseld averaged a double-double in points and rebounds, with averages of 10.8 points and 14.0 rebounds per game. He also averaged 3.9 assists, excellent for a center, in the 36 minutes he played per game. Unseld was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988, and in 1996, he was named as one of the NBA&#x27;s 50 Greatest Players of all time. In 2021, he was named on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Unseld as the 60th greatest player in NBA history.

==Executive and coaching career==
After Unseld&#x27;s retirement in 1981, he moved into a front office position with the Bullets, where he served as vice president for six years before being named head coach in 1988. He resigned following the 1994 season with a 202–345 record (.369). Unseld became the Bullets&#x27; general manager in 1996 (they were renamed to the Wizards in 1997) and served in that role for seven years. He guided the team to the playoffs once during his tenure as general manager.

==Personal life==
Unseld&#x27;s wife, Connie, opened Unselds School in 1979. A coed private school located in southwest Baltimore, it has a daycare program, nursery school and a kindergarten-to-eighth grade curriculum. Connie and daughter Kimberly served as teachers at the school. Unseld worked as an office manager and head basketball coach. He was the godfather of Cleveland Cavaliers all-star forward, Kevin Love, as Kevin&#x27;s father Stan Love was a teammate of Unseld&#x27;s on the Baltimore Bullets. His son, Wes Unseld Jr., was a coach in the NBA who became the head coach of the Wizards in 2021 and was fired in 2024.

==Death==
Unseld died on June 2, 2020, after suffering lengthy health battles.

<doc id="1171755" wikidata="Q7933271" url="?curid=1171755" title="Violet Palmer">
<text>Violet Renice Palmer (born July 20, 1964) is a retired American basketball referee in the NBA and WNBA and the first female official to reach the highest competitive tier in any major U.S. professional sports league. She also earned recognition as a member of two NCAA Division II women&#x27;s championship basketball teams. Palmer was the first woman to officiate an NBA playoff game when she did so in the April 25, 2006 match between the Indiana Pacers and New Jersey Nets. In the NBA, Palmer wore uniform number 12. She retired in 2016.

==Biography==
Violet Palmer was born July 20, 1964 in Lynwood, California. She was raised in Compton, California, and grew up in the same neighborhood where Serena and Venus Williams lived as small children. She graduated from Compton High School, and attended college at Cal Poly Pomona. While at Cal Poly, she played point guard on the 1985 and 1986 NCAA Division II women&#x27;s championship teams. 

In 2001, Palmer established Violet Palmer&#x27;s Official Camp to train youths in the art of officiating games. The camp runs annually from July 9 to July 11.

In 2010, Palmer was part of a family team on the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

In 2022, Palmer received an honorary doctorate of science from her alma mater, Cal Poly Pomona.

==Officiating career==
Palmer has officiated hundreds of NBA and WNBA games.

After years of refereeing at various levels, including NBA pre-season and exhibition games, Palmer was offered an opportunity to officiate the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s tournament in 1996. She accepted, but the offer was later retracted when NCAA members balked at the idea of having a female referee male players.

In 1997, Palmer and Dee Kantner were signed by the NBA to together become the first top-level female officials in any major U.S. professional sport. On October 31, 1997, Palmer made history when she officiated the NBA season opener between the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks, in British Columbia, Canada.

As a woman, Palmer&#x27;s achievement was received with mixed feelings. While magazines such as &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; generally celebrated her achievement, some NBA players were critical. Charles Barkley: &quot;Violet, I was wrong about you. I apologize. You&#x27;re all right with me.&quot; Former basketball player Dennis Scott, who played for the Phoenix Suns at the time, also expressed concern at having females referee male players. Scott, in particular, worried that female referees would feel verbally or physically abused. However, Palmer has been officiating without any major gender issues so far.
Palmer was one of three NBA referees who officiated the brawl-marred December 16, 2006, game between the Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks. The officiating crew, which also consisted of Dick Bavetta and Robbie Robinson, ejected all 10 players who were on the court when the brawl broke out.

On May 28, 2009, Palmer was hired as coordinator of women&#x27;s basketball officials for the West Coast Conference.

On February 16, 2014, Palmer became the first female to officiate an All-Star Game in any of the four major United States sports.

On July 6, 2015, Palmer was named coordinator of women&#x27;s basketball officials for the Western Athletic Conference.

On September 22, 2016, Palmer retired from on-court duties with the NBA due to knee issues. Afterward, she began work as a manager in the NBA&#x27;s referee operations department. At the time of her retirement, she had refereed 919 NBA games.

On June 20, 2022, Palmer was hired as coordinator of women&#x27;s basketball officials for the Big West Conference.

== Personal life ==
Palmer is an out lesbian. In July 2014, she announced plans to marry her girlfriend of 20 years, celebrity hair stylist Tanya Stine.

<doc id="1171759" wikidata="Q951327" url="?curid=1171759" title="Pasch's theorem">
<text>In geometry, Pasch&#x27;s theorem, stated in 1882 by the German mathematician Moritz Pasch, is a result in plane geometry which cannot be derived from Euclid&#x27;s postulates.

==Statement==
The statement is as follows: [Here, for example, (, , ) means that point lies between points and .]

==Hilbert&#x27;s use of Pasch&#x27;s theorem==
David Hilbert originally included Pasch&#x27;s theorem as an axiom in his modern treatment of Euclidean geometry in &quot;The Foundations of Geometry&quot; (1899). However, it was found by E.H. Moore in 1902 that the axiom is redundant, and revised editions now list it as a theorem. Thus Pasch&#x27;s theorem is also known as Hilbert&#x27;s discarded axiom.

Pasch&#x27;s axiom, a separate statement, is also included and remains an axiom in Hilbert&#x27;s treatment.

<text>The Kimpton Hotel &amp; Restaurant Group, LLC is a San Francisco, California, based hotel and restaurant brand owned by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts (IHG) since 2015. 

==Overview==
Founded in 1981 by Bill Kimpton and led by Chief Executive Officer Mike DeFrino, the group was the largest chain of boutique hotels in the United States in 2011. As of January 2024, it operates 81 hotels worldwide with a number of new properties forthcoming. New hotels have been announced for Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Paris, Barcelona, Charlottesville, Frankfurt, Grenada, Bali, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Rotterdam and Sanya.

While most Kimpton properties are marketed under their own names as boutique hotels, the company launched two sub-brands in 2005, Hotel Palomar and Hotel Monaco. Each property has a restaurant or bar that is marketed as upscale or trendy. In 2020, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine ranked Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants at number 10 on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction. The company also manages and operates hotels owned by other entities, under contract.

On December 16, 2014, IHG announced that it would acquire Kimpton for $430 million in cash. IHG retained the Kimpton brand name within the U.S. and is expanding it globally. As a result of the acquisition, seven of Kimpton&#x27;s nine hotels in San Francisco left the brand in July 2015.

<text>Naxal is a 2015 Indian Bengali-language vigilante thriller film directed by Debaditya Bandyopadhyay, starring Mithun Chakraborty and Dhritiman Chatterjee in pivotal roles.

The backdrop of the film is the Naxal Amol or Naxal Period. It was a period in the history of the state of West Bengal that began with the infiltration of the ideas of the socialist movements in the western world (especially Latin America) into the psyche of many Bengali youths. Mithun Chakraborty plays the lead role in this film as a Naxalite.

==Plot==
1971: The story opens on the 21st May with the escaping of a few Naxalite youths. The most prominent among them is Anirban Sen. On that day, one of them named Samar dies while Anirban and their leader Sankar Da go absconding.

2013: After nearly 42 years, one fine morning a FAX arrives at the Kolkata Metro Railways Headquarters. It says that today Anirban will commit suicide under the last Metro. Questions regarding his identity and demands start emerging as the news has taken centre stage in the city. This news shake the entire city from Kolkata Police Headquarters (Lalbazar) to the news channels, while Anirban rattles the administration with one FAX after the other. On the other hand, Siddhartha Chowdhury, CEO of the number-one Bengali News Channel engages himself in using this incident to boost his channel&#x27;s TRP. Shubhankar, a journalist with Siddhartha&#x27;s channel, while searching for Anirban, discovers that one of those persons who went missing on 21 May 1971, Sankar Da is still alive and is living in Kolkata with a new name, who was none other than Siddhartha Chowdhury himself. Siddhartha, in the meanwhile, announces that he will telecast Anirban&#x27;s Suicide LIVE on television, which in turn has plummeted the commercial value of his channel. On the other way, he realises that Anirban knows a lot about him after hearing the story from Anirban, comes to realise that Anirban is to be finished at any cost, and so he takes his revolver out from safety locker to finish him off, making to prove that he was a ruthless criminal, and not a real hero.

<text>Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP (also known as MoFo) is an American multinational law firm headquartered in San Francisco, California, with 17 offices located throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe. 

==History==

In 1883, Alexander Francis Morrison (1856–1921), an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley, and Hastings College of the Law, founded the firm&#x27;s oldest ancestor in San Francisco under the name O’Brien &amp; Morrison. His aim was to practice &quot;principally in the line of corporation business.&quot;

In 1891, Morrison formed a partnership with Constantine E.A. Foerster (1860–1898). However, Foerster died in 1898 at age 37 from tuberculosis. After his death, other attorneys came in as partners and the firm&#x27;s name changed several times over the next two decades. 

By late 1924, the firm of Morrison, Dunne &amp; Brobeck had seven partners and eight associates. On November 29, 1924, everyone arrived at work to find on their desks a letter signed by partners Herman Phleger, William I. Brobeck and Peter F. Dunne which announced the &quot;reorganization&quot; of the firm. By &quot;reorganization&quot; they actually meant dissolution of the firm, effective December 31, 1924. Morrison&#x27;s widow May was furious at the three men for wrecking the firm which she regarded as her late husband&#x27;s legacy and prohibited them from using the Morrison name. 

A 1996 history of the Brobeck firm claimed that Phleger had persuaded Brobeck and Dunne that the law firm would be more profitable if they ejected the four other partners, so the three of them suddenly fired and locked out the four other partners, who then had to break into the office with a fire axe to retrieve their files. However, this story may be apocryphal because the Morrison firm&#x27;s files include documents showing that the attorneys had attempted to provide for the &quot;orderly dissolution of the old firm&quot;, the transfer of its files, and the settlement of fees for pending matters. 

The firm&#x27;s attorneys organized two new law firms which began operations in January 1925: Dunne, Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison (later renamed Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison) and Morrison, Hohfeld, Foerster, Shuman &amp; Clark. The &quot;Foerster&quot; of the latter firm was not the late Constantine E.A. Foerster, but his son Roland, who had joined the Morrison firm as an associate in 1916. May Morrison was affectionate towards the four founding partners of the latter firm and actively assisted them in creating a new firm to carry forward the legacy of the old one. They were the &quot;favorites&quot; of her late husband Alexander, whom she called &quot;Aleck&quot;, and she thus referred to them as &quot;Aleck&#x27;s Boys&quot;. 

Starting in the 1920s and 1930s, the firm developed a deep client roster, which brought stability to sustain the firm over the next three decades.

In the 1960s, a group of young partners—John Austin, Dick Archer, and Bob Raven—set out to reinvigorate the firm in response to stagnant revenue and changes in the business and social environment. The strategy, resulting from the so-called &quot;Schroeder&#x27;s meetings&quot; because they were held at the San Francisco restaurant, included ideas for modernizing the practice of law. The partners replaced outmoded policies and insisted on budgets and operational plans. The firm started to recruit at law schools and began hiring women lawyers. In time, the firm rebuilt its litigation practice by training new associates on small bank cases.

In 1974, the firm expanded outside San Francisco and opened an office in Los Angeles to better meet the needs of longtime client Crocker National Bank.

Soon after, the firm expanded again, opening an office in Washington, D.C. in 1979 and its first non-U.S. office in London in 1980.

In 1987, the firm merged with New York-based litigation company Parker Auspitz and opened its Tokyo office.

The firm merged again in 1991, this time with Ciotti &amp; Murashige. A decade later, Morrison &amp; Foerster became one of the largest international law firms in Tokyo when it merged with Ito &amp; Mitomi.

In 2003, Morrison &amp; Foerster received their first 100% rating on HRC&#x27;s Corporate Equality Index indicating they met all 7 of that year&#x27;s criteria for having a positive record &quot;toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, consumers and investors&quot;.

In November 2013, the firm expanded its European presence by opening an office in Berlin. The following month, the German team advised Axel Springer, one of Europe&#x27;s largest media companies, on its acquisition of N24 Media, Germany&#x27;s largest independent producers of information.

In 2022, Morrison &amp; Foerster was a founding member of the Legal Alliance for Reproductive Rights, a coalition of United States law firms offering free legal services to people seeking and providing abortions in the wake of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

==Clients==

The firm was the lead bankruptcy counsel to Residential Capital. ResCap. and secured their chapter 11 plan.

In July 2013, Morrison &amp; Foerster represented SoftBank in its $21.6 billion acquisition of a 78 percent stake in Sprint Nextel. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the transaction was &quot;one of the most complex and unusual deals in the annals of takeovers.&quot; The firm also represented SoftBank in Alibaba&#x27;s U.S. IPO—the largest IPO in history.

==Morrison &amp; Foerster Foundation==

Formed in 1986, the Morrison &amp; Foerster Foundation is a charitable foundation funded mainly by the firm&#x27;s partners. In total, the Foundation has donated $44 million to nonprofit organizations since its inception.

In 2015, Law360 recognized Morrison &amp; Foerster as one of the 10 Most Charitable Law Firms.

<doc id="1171780" wikidata="Q17162844" url="?curid=1171780" title="Body piercing materials">
<text>In modern Western body piercing, a wide variety of materials are used. Some cannot be autoclaved, and others may induce allergic reactions, or harbour bacteria. Certain countries, such as those belonging to the EU, have legal regulations specifying which materials can be used in new piercings.

==Minimum standards for jewelry for initial piercings==
The Association of Professional Piercers in the USA has developed safety standards for body jewelry based on research and historical experience.

Products with an ISO or ASTM designation are so noted and a statement specifying the finish requirements particular to body jewelry has been added. In addition, several materials designated for applications other than implants have been proven through historical and practical application to be suitably biocompatible for initial piercing.

* Steel that is ASTM F-138 compliant or ISO 5832-1 compliant
* Steel that is ISO 10993-6, 10993-10, and/or 10993-11 compliant
* Titanium (Ti6Al4V ELI) that is ASTM F136 compliant or ISO 5832-3 compliant
* Titanium that is ASTM F-67 compliant
* Solid 14-carat or higher nickel-free white or yellow gold
* Solid nickel-free platinum alloy
* Niobium (Nb)
* Fused quartz glass, lead-free borosilicate or lead-free soda-lime glass
* Polymers (plastics) as follows:
** Tygon Medical Surgical Tubing S-50HL or S-54HL
** Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that is ASTM F754-00 compliant
** Any plastic material that is ISO 10993-6, 10993-10 and/or 10993-11 compliant and/or meets the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI material classification.

=== Minimum Standard for Jewelry Threading for Initial Piercings ===
*All threaded or press-fit jewelry must have internal tapping (no screw threads on posts).

=== Minimum Standard for Jewelry Surface Finish for Initial Piercings ===
*For body jewelry purposes, surfaces and ends must be smooth, free of nicks, scratches, burrs, polishing compounds and metals must have a consistent mirror finish.

== Metals ==

===Steel===
Surgical stainless steel is a grade of stainless steel that is used in biomedical applications. The most common &quot;surgical steels&quot; are austenitic 316 stainless and martensitic 440 and 420 stainless steels. There is no formal definition on what constitutes a &quot;surgical stainless steel&quot;, so product manufacturers and distributors apply the term to refer to any grade of corrosion resistant steel.

316 stainless steel, also referred to as marine grade stainless steel, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce. However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316.[1][2] Implants and equipment that are put under pressure (bone fixation screws, prostheses, body piercing jewelry) are made out of austenitic steel, often 316L and 316LVM compliant to ASTM F138.[3] 316 surgical steel is used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination. ASTM F138[3]-compliant steel is also used in the manufacture of body piercing jewellery[4] and body modification implants.

440 and 420 stainless steels, known also by the name &quot;Cutlery Stainless Steel&quot;, are high carbon steels alloyed with chromium. They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other cutlery steels, but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless. Biomedical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance.

Allergic reactions, when they occur, are rarely due to the stainless steel but from other factors (most commonly from mechanical irritation or harsh cleaning products). Allergic reactions typically include itching, redness, and swelling, with a discharge of clear fluid that is not lymph. The element in stainless steel that causes allergic reactions in some people is nickel. Polishing the jewelry to a mirror like luster results in a protective layer of chromium oxide which reduces the migration of the Nickel content into the tissue.

One disadvantage of steel is its weight. For larger pieces of jewelry this can be a problem as it can cause tension in the body tissue, and also unwanted stretching or tearing of a piercing. In areas with low blood circulation, such as the earlobe, this can be potentially dangerous. However, with smaller jewelry, there is no need to worry.

Another downside is its tendency to become very cold during winter. This can cause problems; due to this, many change their jewelry to others made of horn, bone, wood, plastics and glass during winter.

Steel body jewelry may be sterilized in an autoclave.

The two most common standards that apply to body jewelry made of steel are ASTM F138 and ISO 5832-1 which describe the qualities of steel for surgical implants.

The only quality recommended for use by the Association of Professional Piercers is steel that is certified to meet ASTM or ISO standards for surgical implant applications.
&quot;Surgical Steel is made of a variety of alloys. Many of them are used for body jewelry, but only a few specific grades are proven biocompatible&quot;

===Titanium===

Titanium body jewelry is often manufactured in either commercially pure grades 1 to 4, grade 5 TI6AL4V alloy or grade 23 Ti6AL4V ELI alloy.

The only quality recommended for use by the Association of Professional Piercers is Titanium that is certified to meet ASTM or ISO standards for surgical implant applications. &quot;Look for implant certified titanium (Ti6Al4V ELI) that is ASTM F136 compliant or ISO 5832-3 compliant, or commercially pure titanium that is ASTM F67 compliant.&quot;.

Pure and alloyed qualities have long been used for both piercings and surgical implants, and very few long-term allergies and other complications have been reported, though as with any material they could arise after prolonged contact with the human body. Ti6Al4V ELI alloy contains aluminum and vanadium.

When the EU Nickel Directive came into force - high nickel bearing alloys were restricted from use in primary (new) piercings. Because of its virtually &#x27;Nickel Free&#x27; content Titanium has become one of the preferred materials used in piercing jewellery within the borders of the EU.

Titanium jewellery is lightweight (around 60% the weight of stainless steel given the same volume), it is highly corrosion resistant and less likely to react with body fluids, is not magnetic, it can be anodized to create a layer of colored oxide on the surface. Common colors are yellow, blue, purple, green, and rainbow.

Titanium can be sterilized in an autoclave.

===Niobium===

Niobium is a metal resembling titanium, but it is softer and heavier. When using niobium in a piercing jewelry it has to be as pure as possible, the threshold value being 99.9% niobium. This is sometimes called &quot;999 Niobium&quot;. Impurities in low quality material can lead to allergies.

Pure niobium does not react to body fluids, oxygen or cleaning agents. It can safely be autoclaved. It is allowed in healing piercings by the EU nickel law.

Niobium can be heat treated to obtain a permanently dim black surface. A Septum retainer in black niobium is practically invisible.

The selection of niobium jewelry is much smaller than that of titanium and other common metals, mainly because niobium jewelry is more expensive and more difficult to produce.

===Bronze===

Bronze is often used in larger piercings in the form of earweights and ethnic jewelry from Indonesia and other places of the world.

Bronze is an alloy of different metals but the most common blend (in piercing jewelry) is 90% copper and 10% tin.

When buying bronze jewelry, buyers should make sure to buy from a reputable seller as some bronzes can contain arsenic which can &quot;bleed&quot; into your body. Bronze can also discolor the skin with a greenish color which can be removed, but if it gets into open wounds it can permanently discolor the tissue.

===Silver===
Jewelry made out of silver, a noble metal, has been common for centuries in all forms of jewelry. It has a certain luster and can also be treated to make certain areas black which gives a nice contrast.

===Gold===

Gold is a noble metal with a long tradition for use in jewelry.

When using gold for piercings, a lower purity than 14 or 18 carat (58 to 75%) is not recommended.

Gold is about as soft as lead and is easily scratched. These scratches can irritate the body, especially in new piercings. Tongue jewelry made from gold is not recommended as chewing on the beads is common. To avoid the irritation of damaged jewelry from such scratches and flaws, gold colored titanium jewelry is a safer substitute.

Piercing jewelry is often made of a gold alloy, the most common being 18k, with 24k being entirely pure and much softer. 18k gold usually contains 75% gold and the remaining 25% copper, silver and traces of other metals. In lower quality gold, zinc, nickel and other irritants can also be found.

As said, gold jewelry should only be used in healing piercings if it is nickel free or palladium based. Allergy to gold is uncommon but it does exist, and then mostly from white gold. In some extreme cases, the copper in the jewelry can tarnish and cause greenish discoloring of the tissue.

Gold can become discolored from autoclaving. It could be several things, reaction to the chemical indicators, residues left from polishing or cleaning products, or corrosion of elements in the gold itself.

Experienced body piercing studios clean the jewelry with a jewelry steamer, and then an ultrasonic process with warm alkaline detergent, followed by a distilled or deionized water rinse, then an alcohol rinse to help remove residues. Use Class 5 or 6 integrating indicators instead of class 1 or 2 chemical process indicators for monitoring autoclave sterilization with gold.

==Porcelain==
Porcelain is high temperature fired stoneware. If the glaze is non-porous and free of toxic elements such as lead and cadmium it may be suitable for wear in healed piercings.

==Glass==
Glass is a common piercing material which has been used for thousands of years. For example, earplugs made of glass have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs.

If correctly shaped and manufactured, glass can be a functional material: comfortable to wear, tough, and safe for the body. However, cheaper glass beads that unprotected can easily break into shards. If you drop glass jewelry on the floor, you probably won&#x27;t be able to use it again. Also if you have a cheap bead in a tongue piercing and accidentally chew on it, it can break into tiny shards and cause lacerations.

It is possible to sterilize glass in a steam-autoclave but the heat may cause cracking in cheaper products.

==Polymers==

Polymers (plastics) have been used for a long time for both implants and piercings. Early piercers often used it as a healing jewelry. After the piercing was done, a product resembling a thick fishing line was inserted in the hole and its end was rivetted together. When the piercing was healed, the plastic was cut and pulled out, and then real jewelry was inserted. The method is still in use today, but to a much smaller extent. There are many better and safer ways today.

Polymers can be light, with resistance to the body&#x27;s chemical reactions and can be safe against most allergies. However, many polymers are absorbent and have a porous surface, which makes it necessary to often take the jewelry out and thoroughly clean or replace it to avoid infection or sensitization from residues.

===PTFE===
PTFE or Teflon was invented in 1938 and can be refined for use in the medical industry for prolonged contact with skin.

Refined PTFE can be made biocompatible. It is a lightweight plastic, it is bendable, autoclaveable, not visible with X-rays, not magnetic, and very stable. It is suited for implants and piercings, especially if some flexibility of the material is desired.

PTFE is commonly used as a retainer.

===Acrylic, plexiglas===

Acrylic, sold as plexiglas or any of a variety of names, is a transparent plastic, in piercing mostly used for plugs and tapers.

Due to the material&#x27;s smoothness, it has been used for stretching. Many overenthusiastic wearers have damaged their holes with acrylic tapers.

It is not a safe material for damaged or new piercings and can not be heat sterilized by autoclave as it can melt or discolor. Acrylics can emit carcinogenic toxins above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 °C), which normal body temperature is above. It is also a fragile material and can easily crack, craze or shard if dropped. Jewelry made of acrylic has a tendency to collect body fluids and skin parts in tiny pores and fissures. The Association of Professional Piercers suggests that it may only be used for temporary wear in healed piercings.

Acrylic can be a chemical irritant or allergen, resulting in Acrylic monomer dermatitis from the decomposition of methyl methacrylate.

==Gems==

Gems or gemstones are mostly used as inlays in plugs and as beads in BCRs.

The quality varies widely with different gems, and it can be hard to find stones big enough without cracks and scratches.

Some stones may affect the body such as malachite which contains copper that can discolor the skin. Others may contain lead or arsenic or other hazardous materials. However, stones are generally not a problem for the body as long as they don&#x27;t have sharp or pointy edges or are not very heavy. They can most of the time be autoclaved, but some stones, such as opals can&#x27;t stand the heat and should be cleaned some other way.

See Gemstones

==Natural materials==

===Wood===

Wood is a common material for plugs and other shapes. Wooden pieces tend to keep warm in cold conditions, they are lightweight, they often stay in place better than other plugs and also they allow the body to &quot;breathe&quot; so the piercing is less likely to smell as it might with other materials.

The downside of wood as body jewelry is if not cared for properly it may dry out and lose luster. This can be prevented with mineral oil or jojoba oil and avoiding excessive exposure to water.

It should not be autoclaved as that can cause cracking, warping, or splitting.

Wood has grain that will rise if not properly finished, dramatically changing the texture. The porosity of wood and inability to be safely sterilized renders it inappropriate as a material for initial piercings or unhealed stretches.

Some types of wood are strongly discouraged for piercing jewelry as they can cause allergic reactions or otherwise be irritating for the skin. Hardwood is preferable. Correctly treated, it doesn&#x27;t swell, it&#x27;s durable, stable, does not absorb a lot of moisture or body fluids, and the surface can be polished to be very smooth.

Wood is also an excellent basis for more advanced jewelry. The flat faces of a plug can be inlaid with gemstones or metals, etc. Wood can easily be shaped and it comes in many colors.

===Amber===

Amber is fossilized tree sap and has a long tradition of use in jewelry. Its most common color is a goldish yellow but it also comes in black, greenish, reddish, white, brown and blue and various blends. It can be found with natural inclusions of small animals, insects and plants which can be amazingly well-preserved.

Amber is commonly used for inlays in metal jewelry or in plugs made of horn, bone or wood etc., but there are also massive amber plugs.

The material has a smooth surface that is kind to the skin, but tends to be a little fragile and can&#x27;t handle heat very well, so it shouldn&#x27;t be autoclaved.

===Fauna===
Biological organic materials are quite common in the world of piercings and are what were used historically by many cultures. Like wood, they seem well suited as body jewelry as they are easily shaped and bone, horn, ivory etc. may be finished to an acceptably smooth surface. Biological organic materials seem to allow your body to &quot;breathe&quot;. They get less cold than other hard solid materials due to their insulating properties during winter. However, like wood, they can dry and crack.

Badly cleaned materials can transfer remaining bacteria and such to the body of the jewelry-wearer, so therefore it is very important that you buy your jewelry from a company with ethical good manufacturing practices.

Lower quality jewelry might have scratches or cracks which can harbor bacteria, or poor finishes which can result in harsh textures.

Animal products that are not acquired legally are not suitable as a raw material for the manufacture of body jewelry. There are ethical alternatives for some material such as fossilized mammoth, mastodon, or walrus ivory, which is a mineralized material most commonly found in Siberia or Alaska. Every year, large amounts of mammoth ivory are exposed in the permafrost of Siberia. The abundance of mammoth ivory, and the fact that the trade is legal, has dealt a hard blow against the illegal ivory trade. Mammoth ivory can be found in more than the normal white/yellowish colors normal ivory has. This is because minerals in the ground sometimes color the ivory. Unless it is properly cared for, mammoth ivory is prone to cracking caused by changes in temperature and moisture levels.

Bone, horn, ivory and such should not be autoclaved, as it will destroy them. They are also unsuitable for unhealed piercings or for wear while stretching existing ones.

<doc id="1171782" wikidata="Q385074" url="?curid=1171782" title="Oita Trinita">
<text>is a Japanese football club located in Ōita, Capital of Ōita Prefecture. They currently play in J2 League, Japanese second tier of professional football. 

== Name origin ==

The club&#x27;s name, &quot;Trinita&quot;, is the Italian translation of the word &quot;trinity (trinità)&quot;, which was the club&#x27;s original name before being changed in 1999, and &quot;Ōita&quot;, the club&#x27;s home town. The combined word expresses the will of the local citizens, companies, and government to support the team. Another connection to the Italian culture can be found in the city nickname Azzurro (&quot;light blue&quot; in Italian).

== History ==

The club was formed as Ōita Trinity in 1994 and advanced through the Ōita Prefectural League and the Kyushu League before finishing as the runner-up of the 1996 National League, resulting in promotion to the JFL. In 1999, the club changed its name to &quot;Trinita&quot; due to copyright infringement concerns. The same year, the club joined J.League Division 2, the second-highest flight in Japanese football (renamed to its current name of J2 League in 2015) and placed third. The club also placed third in 2000, and despite being in contention for promotion until the final game of the season in 2001, finished sixth. The following year, the club won J.League Division 2 and finally earned promotion to the top-flight Division 1. In 2008, the club won the J.League Cup, the first major title won by a Kyūshū club since Yawata Steel SC shared the 1964 Emperor&#x27;s Cup.

In the 2009 season, Ōita suffered their worst-ever results in their seven-year history in the topflight, including 14 straight losses in league matches, which is the current worst record in the J.League since the golden goal system was eliminated. Ōita even fired cup-winning manager Pericles Chamusca in mid-July. On October 25, the club&#x27;s relegation was confirmed after being held to a 1–1 draw by ten-man Kyoto Sanga, although the club would have faced relegation anyway as they had outstanding loans from the JFL&#x27;s emergency fund and league rules prohibit clubs with such loans from participating in the top tier.

During the 2012 J.League Division 2 season, Ōita finished in sixth place, qualifying for the promotion playoffs in the first year of its introduction in Japan&#x27;s second flight as the club had also paid back all its emergency loans that October. Despite being the lowest seed, Ōita defeated Kyoto Sanga 4–0 in the semi-final and JEF United Chiba 1–0 in the final, earning promotion to 2013 J.League Division 1, returning to the top tier after a 5-year absence This time, however, their top tier stay lasted only one season. In 2015 they were further relegated to J3 League after losing in the promotion playoffs to Machida Zelvia on December 6, becoming the first major trophy winner to be relegated to the third tier. The club immediately gained promotion back to J2 League by winning the J3 League title in 2016. In 2018, after finishing as runner&#x27;s up in the J2 League in 2018, Oita Trinita gained promotion back to J1. After finishing 18th in 2021, Trinita would be relegated back to J2 League, but in the background of that, the club made a Cinderella run to the Emperor&#x27;s Cup Final. Just 1 week after the confirmation to be relegated, they defeated defending Emperor&#x27;s Cup champion Kawasaki Frontale in stunning fashion in the semis; after the game was tied 1 all, Trinita won 4–5 on penalty kicks. They ended up losing to Urawa Red Diamonds in the final, giving the Reds their eighth Emperor&#x27;s Cup title.

The club will play its second consecutive season at the J2 League in the 2023 season.

== Stadium ==
The club&#x27;s home town is the city of Ōita, but the club draws support from the entire Ōita Prefecture. The stadium originally had a capacity of 43,000. After the 2002 FIFA World Cup, 3,000 movable seats on the track were removed, giving the stadium its current capacity of 40,000.

The club&#x27;s home ground is Resonac Dome Oita, also known as the &quot;Big Eye&quot;, which was one of the venues built for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The club practices at its adjacent football and rugby field, and Ōita City Public Ground.

<text>Bobone is an old, heavily eroded crater formation that lies on the far side of the Moon. Little remains of the original crater formation, leaving only a bowl-shaped depression in the surface that is pock-marked by tiny craterlets. It is attached to the southwest rim of the large satellite crater Kovalevskaya Q, which has its northeast rim overlaid by Kovalevskaya itself. To the west-southwest is Bronk.

<text>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and affiliated companies, commonly shortened to Nationwide, is a group of large U.S. insurance and financial services companies based in Columbus, Ohio. The company also operates regional headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and Des Moines, Iowa. Nationwide currently has approximately 25,000 employees, and is ranked No. 75 in the 2024 Fortune 500 list.

Nationwide Financial Services (NFS), a component of the group, was partially floated on the New York Stock Exchange prior to being repurchased by Nationwide Mutual in 2009. It had owned the majority of NFS common stock since it had gone public in 1997.

==History==

===Beginnings as Farm Bureau Mutual===
In the 1920s, farmers were paying the same rates on their automobile insurance as city drivers even though they had fewer accidents and claims than city drivers. The Ohio Farm Bureau decided to set up its own insurance company to offer rates that accurately reflected the driving habits of farmers. On April 10, 1926, the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company obtained a license to do business in Ohio, and two days later, it acquired its financing—a $10,000 loan drawn from the membership dues of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation.

At that time, Ohio law required 100 people to pledge to become policyholders. The first agents managed to recruit ten times that number, and on April 14, 1926, Farm Bureau Mutual started a business with over 1,000 policyholders. The first product of the new company, as its name implied, was automobile insurance. The company wrote policies only to Ohio farmers who were members for the Ohio Farm Bureau.

===Expansion===
In 1928, Farm Bureau Mutual expanded to West Virginia, followed by Maryland, Delaware, Vermont, and North Carolina. Farm Bureau Mutual began underwriting residents of small towns in 1931 and residents in larger cities in 1934. Also, in 1934, Farm Bureau Mutual began offering fire insurance. This product grew the following year with the purchase of a struggling fire insurance company.

In 1935, Farm Bureau Mutual acquired the Life Insurance Company of America from the bankrupt fraternal insurer, American Insurance Union. The company was later renamed to Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company in 1938.

With growth, came a need for the expansion of office space. In 1936, the company moved into the 246 Building at 246 N. High Street in Columbus.

By 1943, Farm Bureau Mutual operated in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Even with the tripling of space in the 246 Building (which was finally dedicated on the 25th anniversary of the company), Farm Bureau Mutual still had insufficient office space and began opening regional offices in 1951.

In 1955, Farm Bureau Mutual changed its name to Nationwide Insurance, a name by which it is commonly known today. In the 10 years that followed, Nationwide expanded into Oregon, making the company truly &quot;nationwide&quot;. It also expanded into 19 other states, bringing the total by 1965 to 32 states and the District of Columbia.

Nationwide outgrew the 246 Building by the 1970s, and work began on a new skyscraper headquarters for the company. In 1978, One Nationwide Plaza was completed at the southwest corner of N. High Street and Nationwide Blvd. on the northern edge of downtown Columbus, Ohio. Since 1988, Nationwide has added the following to its presence in Downtown Columbus: Plaza Two (on the northeast corner of High Street and Chestnut), Plaza Three (just west of High Street and Chestnut), Plaza Four (Front Street), 275 Marconi (behind Plazas One and Three on Marconi Blvd), and 10 West Nationwide, which together with Plaza One form the primary downtown complex. In addition to downtown Columbus, Nationwide also has a significant presence in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan suburbs of Dublin, Grandview Heights, and Grove City.

=== Nationwide Slogan &amp; Jingle ===
The genesis for the Nationwide slogan, &quot;The Man from Nationwide is on your Side&quot; was first introduced to the public in 1965, composed by Steve Karmen, an acclaimed jingle writer and it was later set to music in 1969. But by 1971 being an insurance agent was no longer strictly a male profession, so the words &quot;the Man from&quot; were dropped in 1972, and &quot;Nationwide is on your side&quot; became the slogan, after the first female agent Diana M Krapf was hired and asked that it be changed so she could properly represent the company as an insurance agent. Nationwide did make these changes (i.e. signs, letterheads, TV and print ads, even business cards) showing the changing attitudes of the times and were followed years later by other major companies.

==Sponsorships==

===Nationwide Tour===
In 2003, Nationwide secured the naming rights from what was then the Buy.com Tour, the second-highest men&#x27;s professional golf tour in the United States. The tour was known by this name until 2012 when Nationwide relinquished the naming rights.

===Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital===
On September 24, 2007, Columbus Children&#x27;s Hospital was rededicated as Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital. This was done in response to a $50 million donation to the hospital by Nationwide.

===Helping Columbus become a major league city===
By 1997, the city of Columbus had grown to become the 15th largest city in the United States. However, Columbus by this time was the largest American city without a professional sports franchise competing in the top leagues in the United States (i.e., Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, or the National Hockey League).

After plans to move the Hartford Whalers to Columbus failed when voters rejected a tax levy, the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company announced that it would build an arena adjacent to One Nationwide Plaza in an effort to bring an NHL franchise to Columbus. This second effort was successful, and the Columbus Blue Jackets began play to at Nationwide Arena in late 2000. Nationwide Arena, named for the company, is the centerpiece of the Arena District, an area of entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels linking downtown Columbus with The Short North neighborhood.

Nationwide Realty Investors is the company&#x27;s real estate development arm and was involved with providing the land for a new soccer stadium in Columbus. Nationwide sponsors the Major League Soccer club Columbus Crew, the other major-league sports franchise in town, and has appeared on the front of team shirts since 2020.

===NASCAR===

Nationwide became the title sponsor of the NASCAR Nationwide Series beginning in the 2008 season. On September 18, 2013, the company announced it will no longer sponsor the series after 2014 but will remain an official sponsor of NASCAR. Beginning in 2015, Nationwide became the primary sponsor for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the Sprint Cup Series.

===Memorial Tournament===
On September 3, 2010, Nationwide announced a six-year deal to become the presenting sponsor of the PGA Tour Memorial Tournament beginning with the 2010 event.

===Jack Hanna===
In March 2010, Nationwide announced it would be co-sponsoring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium Director Emeritus Jack Hanna&#x27;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot; TV show and national speaking tour.

Nationwide includes &quot;sexual orientation&quot; and &quot;gender identity&quot; in its equal employment opportunity policy, and provides diversity training to its employees on sexual orientation.

In 2008, Nationwide entered into an exclusive partnership with Tavis Smiley, including sponsorship of Smiley&#x27;s PBS television program as a provider of property and casualty insurance products. The sponsorship of the television program ended in 2011, but the partnership continues for other events and initiatives.

Nationwide was also a national sponsor of the 2009 State of the Black Union event.

Nationwide hired Vernon Blatz, one of the country&#x27;s first blind computer programmers, in 1964. He attended the University of Cincinnati Medical Center&#x27;s trial run of the nation&#x27;s first training program to educate the blind about careers involving computers.

In 2009, Nationwide released Nationwide Mobile, a free iPhone application for Nationwide auto insurance customers and other iPhone users. The app is designed to assist drivers with the steps to take after an accident. It also helps Nationwide customers start the claims process, finds Nationwide-certified local repair shops, and facilitates the exchange of accident and insurance information. Nationwide was the first US insurer to offer such an application for the iPhone.

==CEOs==
==Controversies==

===Death benefit controversy===
In October 2012, Nationwide agreed to pay $7.2 million to resolve a market conduct investigation by a multistate insurance regulator task force regarding its use of the Social Security Death Master File database for paying life insurance claims. Life insurance policies make it clear that it is up to the beneficiaries to notify the insurer. Most insured do notify their insurance companies but as a result of this exam Nationwide identified $144 million in benefits that had not been paid because of customers&#x27; failure to file a claims report. The agreement was announced by California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones on behalf of California, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The settlement reached with the state insurance regularors will commit Nationwide and other insurers to compare its records against the Social Security Death Index and conduct a search for beneficiaries.

===Claims of bad faith===
In June 2014, Nationwide was hit with an $18 million punitive damages award after a plaintiff proved the company &quot;strong-armed its policyholder rather than negotiating in good faith to compensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered in an automobile collision.&quot;

===Super Bowl ad===
During the second quarter of Super Bowl XLIX, Nationwide aired a controversial commercial to promote its Make Safe Happen child safety website and initiative, in which a deceased boy reflects on what life milestones he could not partake in due to his premature death in an accident. The advertisement was scorned and ridiculed by many as morbid, disturbing, and in poor taste against the backdrop of a major, upbeat professional sports event. Following its negative reception, Nationwide released a statement defending its decision to air the ad, explaining that child safety is a serious issue that must be addressed.

<doc id="1171803" wikidata="Q1706317" url="?curid=1171803" title="Southern California Edison">
<text>Southern California Edison (SCE), the largest subsidiary of Edison International, is the primary electric utility company for much of Southern California. It provides 15 million people with electricity across a service territory of approximately 50,000 square miles.
SCE owns all of its electrical transmission facilities and equipment. Deregulation of California&#x27;s electricity market in the late 1990s forced the company to sell many of its power plants, though some were probably sold by choice. SCE retained its hydroelectric plants, totaling about 1,200 MW, and its 75% share of the 2,150-MW San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The plant, which hasn&#x27;t produced power since 2012, is being decommissioned.

In addition to its electric business, SCE operates the sole gas utility and water utility on Santa Catalina Island, under the names Catalina Island Gas Company and Catalina Island Water Company.

== History ==

The origins of the company lie with the grand scheme of business magnate Henry E. Huntington and hydraulic engineer John S. Eastwood, developed around 1908, for a vast complex of reservoirs to be constructed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of central California. Huntington founded Pacific Light and Power, one of the roughly two dozen companies he controlled at the time, to execute what would eventually become one of the largest hydropower systems in the United States, the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. Pacific Light and Power was one of the predecessor companies to SCE, along with Edison Electric, Mt. Whitney Power &amp; Electric Co., California Electric Power Co., Southern California Power Co., and others.

In 2011, a shooting occurred when an employee of Southern California Edison opened fire at an office building in Irwindale.

==Energy Sources==
===Renewable energy===

Southern California Edison allows its customer to obtain their electricity entirely from renewable sources by subscribing to a &quot;green rate&quot;.

In 2006, Southern California Edison planned to secure 1,500 megawatts or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm area. The contract, which more than doubles SCE&#x27;s wind energy portfolio, envisions more than of wind parks in the Tehachapi region, which is triple the size of any existing U.S. wind farm.

In March 2008, Southern California Edison announced a $875 million project to build a network of 250 megawatts of photovoltaic solar power generation, making it the biggest solar cell project in the nation. The photovoltaic cells will cover of rooftops in southern California and will generate enough power to serve 162,000 homes.

In 2009, Southern California Edison entered into a contract with Solar Millennium to purchase solar thermal power up to 726 MW. Southern California Edison also entered into a contract with Stirling Energy Systems to buy electricity from a 500 megawatt, 4,600 acre (19 km2), solar power plant which was due to open in 2009. The purchase was canceled in late 2010, as changes in technology reduced the cost of photovoltaic-based solar power to below that of solar Stirling generated power. This would have been the first commercial application of the dish stirling system. A different technology from the more familiar solar panel, the dish concentrates solar energy by the use of reflective surfaces and by the use of the Stirling heat engine to convert the heat into electricity.

In 2014, Southern California Edison installed the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project, which is composed of more than 600,000 lithium-ion battery cells at Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California in order to test storing power generated from an area that currently has 5,000 wind turbines.

In 2014 SCE had a renewables mix of 23%. By 2016, 28.2% of SCE&#x27;s power sources were renewable.

===Natural gas and energy storage===
In 2017, the company opened two new hybrid electric gas turbine (EGT) units called peaker plants, that combine gas turbines and storage batteries at the same site. Each plant delivers around 50-megawatts; the batteries can provide 10-megawatts and four megawatt-hours of power. Both the turbines and the batteries are designed and manufactured by General Electric’s Power Division.

The plant runs the battery first in a series of short bursts, saving gas usage for longer power demand. The combination of a 30-minute duration battery improves the environmental impact of the gas turbine. The SCE setup (the first of its kind) cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, reduced annual water usage by 2 million gallons and lowered the number of gas starts by 50%.

===Interconnections===

Southern California Edison&#x27;s power grid is linked to other California ISO resources by the Path 26 transmission lines that generally follow Interstate 5 over Tejon Pass. The interconnection takes place at a large substation at Buttonwillow. CAISO&#x27;s and WAPA&#x27;s Path 15 and Path 66, respectively, from Buttonwillow north eventually connect to BPA&#x27;s grid in the Pacific Northwest. There are several other interconnections with local and out-of-state utilities, such as Path 46.

== Policies and Practices ==
=== Electric vehicles ===

Southern California Edison has a number of resources and a rate designed specifically for electric vehicle users.

As of July 2018, Southern California Edison planned to add thousands of new charging stations for passenger electric vehicles (EV). This addition is a component of the company&#x27;s &quot;Charge Ready&quot; program, a pilot program with the aim of increasing the availability of charging ports for EVs. 

Since 2016, Southern California Edison has installed 1,000 charging stations throughout their Southern and Central California service area.

The company also runs a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases.

===Energy research and policy===
Southern California Edison has a long history of research in the energy arena. Often this includes working with other companies and government entities. One example is the SOLARII feasibility generator, which was a solar-powered energy plant that could produce electricity 24 hours a day. This was done by heating molten salts that would hold the heat during the day and would be used to generate power at night.

Dr. John Jurewitz served as Director of Regulatory Policy for Southern California Edison for 15 years until his retirement in July 2007. His major areas of research are in oil, gas, and electricity policy and greenhouse gas regulation. He has testified and participated in government-sponsored proceedings addressing electric industry restructuring and energy policy at the state, federal, and international levels.

In November, 2014, SCE announced a partnership with Ice Energy to provide more efficient energy storage by freezing water at night when electricity is cheaper. (Ice Energy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019.)

===Labor practice controversy===
In 2015, Southern California Edison laid off about 400 IT employees, with an additional 100 IT workers leaving voluntarily. Meanwhile, the utility company hired immigrants from India through Infosys, based in Bangalore, and Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai, which are among the largest users of H-1B visas. SCE was subsequently investigated by the US Department of Labor for potential H1-B visa abuse.

== Litigation ==
On January 13, 2025, four lawsuits were filed against SCE in relation to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, alleging that the company had &quot;violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs&quot; during the fire weather event, according to &quot;NPR&quot;. On January 16, the family of an Eaton Fire victim sued SCE for wrongful death, also alleging negligence in SCE&#x27;s failure to deactivate utilities.

<doc id="1171806" wikidata="Q7275671" url="?curid=1171806" title="RAF West Malling">
<text>Royal Air Force West Malling or more simply RAF West Malling is a former Royal Air Force station located south of West Malling, Kent and west of Maidstone, Kent, England.

Originally used as a landing area during the First World War, the site opened as a private landing ground and in 1930, then known as King Hill, home to the Maidstone School of Flying, before being renamed West Malling Airfield, and, in 1932, Maidstone Airport.

During the 1930s many airshows and displays were held by aviators such as Amy Johnson and Alan Cobham, flying from a grass runway.

As war approached, the airfield was taken over by the military, to become RAF West Malling in 1940, serving in the front line against the Luftwaffe. The station saw further service after the war, first with some of the RAFs first jet squadrons, and later as a US Naval Air Station.

After closure as an operational air station in the 1960s, West Malling acquired a more civilian guise, hosting several major Great Warbirds Air Displays during the 70s and 80s, until eventually closing completely as an airfield. The site is now occupied by Kings Hill, a community of mixed residential, commercial, and civic amenities, but still retains several features of its military aviation heritage.

==First World War==

The airfield was as a landing area during the First World War.

==Second World War==

RAF West Malling was not fully operational during the Battle of Britain, having suffered from several damaging bombing raids, but did play an active part in the later stages of the air campaign, becoming a premier night-fighter base.

Maidstone Airport was taken over in the prelude to the Second World War, and the RAF station was formed in June 1940, now with a concrete runway. Designated as one of two RAF Fighter Command stations assigned to &quot;C Sector&quot;, and designated as an advanced aerodrome for RAF Kenley and RAF Biggin Hill. The first aircraft arrived on 8 June 1940. These were Lysanders of No. 26 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, used for photo-reconnaissance sorties over occupied Europe. No. 51 Wing RAF arrived at the same time, and the airfield was provided with anti-aircraft and searchlight batteries for airfield defence.

===Battle of Britain July 1940===

On 12 July, No. 141 Squadron arrived from RAF Turnhouse, Scotland, equipped with Defiant Mk.1 turret-fighters. The squadron&#x27;s first engagement with the enemy occurred a week later, when 6 out of 9 Defiants were destroyed by a superior force of Me.Bf 109s over the Channel. The three surviving aircraft were rescued only when the fight was joined by Hurricanes from No. 111 Squadron. The remainder of the unit returned north to RAF Prestwick on 25 July due to the ineffectiveness of the Defiant against single-seat fighters.

===Dambuster, April 1941===

No. 29 Squadron flying Bristol Beaufighters arrived for its first tour of duty on 27 April 1941. One of the Squadron&#x27;s pilots, Guy Gibson VC, later officer commanding 617 Squadron on the Dambusters Raid, said of the station &quot;Of all the airfields in Great Britain ... we have the most pleasant&quot;.

A regular and long-standing inhabitant, 29 Sqn. left for the last time on 25 November 1950.

===Beaufighters 1942===
In September 1942 Squadron Leader Cathcart Wight-Boycott was promoted to Acting Wing Commander and posted to RAF West Malling as Officer Commanding 29 Squadron who were still flying Bristol Beaufighters. Between December 1942 and January 1943 Wight-Boycott took the additional temporary role of Station Commander at West Malling.

===German Landing, April 1943===

On a misty evening on 16 April 1943 a single-engined aircraft was heard approaching the airfield by the crew of a Beaverette Mk III armoured car of 2769 Field Squadron RAF Regiment, which was on routine patrol around the airfield. The plane, a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter, circled twice then landed. The driver of the armoured car, AC Wilding immediately swung his vehicle into the path of the aircraft to prevent it from taking off again. With no means to escape, the pilot, Feldwebel Otto Bechtold, immediately gave himself up. Driving back to the airfield from the Guardroom, they saw a second Focke-Wulf Fw 190 land, but before the armoured car could reach it, the pilot realised his mistake and turned his aircraft round to begin a take-off run. The car commander, LAC Sharback, at once opened fire with his twin Vickers machine guns and the aircraft slewed off the runway and caught fire. The pilot, wounded in the shoulder and leg and with his flying suit in flames, was thrown clear of the aircraft as it overturned. The two gunners ran to the pilot&#x27;s rescue, extinguished his burning clothing and dragged him clear of the aircraft. Unfortunately, when one of the Station&#x27;s fire trucks was attempting to extinguish the flames, the aircraft exploded in a ball of fire, scattering debris over a radius of 300 yards and seriously injuring several of the RAF Firemen. Within a few minutes, a third Fw 190 crashed on the approach to the runway and a fourth aircraft ploughed into a nearby orchard and burst into flames.

The serviceable aircraft was flown to Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough the next day for detailed examination, and was eventually repainted in RAF livery, designated as a prototype or experimental aircraft.

The German pilots revealed that they had become lost in thick fog over the English Channel, believed they were over France, and had been directed to the airstrip by a searchlight at Detling.

===Doodlebugs, 1944===

From 20 June to 21 July 1944, No. 322 (Dutch) Squadron RAF, equipped with Spitfire Mk XIVs was stationed at West Malling, tasked with intercepting VI &quot;doodlebug&quot; flying bombs launched from the Dutch and French coasts towards London.

==After the war==

===Night fighters, 1950s and 1960s===
In use throughout the 1950s and early 1960s as Britain&#x27;s premier night fighter station.

===United States Navy until 1967===

RAF West Malling then became home to several squadrons of the US Navy, until 1967.

===Care &amp; Maintenance===

From 1967, it was placed on Care &amp; Maintenance, used by several air-industry related businesses.

In 1964 Shorts Brothers operated out of the airfield with a contract with the RAF to service mainly Chipmunk trainers (later Bulldogs), Vickers Varsity aircraft and various other types. This contract ran at least until the late 1970&#x27;s.

In March 1965, Air Cadet 618 VGS (Volunteer Gliding School) moved to West Malling from RAF Manston, setting up its headquarters in the old dispersal area near the runway threshold. Its aircraft (cable-launched Vanguard TX1 gliders) and equipment were stored into one of the large T.2 Type hangars where they remained until 1992.

From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, new build Saab 340 were sent to an aircraft finishing company (Metair),established here, routing via London Southend Airport, in order to be sprayed into the colour schemes of customer airlines.

==Civilian use==

In September 1967, the airfield and its larger hangars were the site of filming for extended scenes in The Beatles&#x27; film Magical Mystery Tour

Following the issue by Idi Amin of Uganda 4 August 1972, of a decree ordering the expulsion of the 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens, around 30,000 of those with British passports emigrated to Britain. The unused accommodation blocks at the airfield were converted for use as temporary homes throughout 1973 until the refugees were resettled around the country. Other RAF stations involved in this exercise were RAF Honington and RAF Stradishall, both in Suffolk.

==Development==

RAF West Malling is now the site of Kings Hill, a mixed development of residential and business developments, including over 2,000 homes, two schools, local retail units and 18-hole golf course.

The former Officers&#x27; Mess (now the Gibson Building, and used as Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council offices) was built in 1939, and is now a Grade II listed building. It was bought by the council in 1974 and converted to become their offices. The building has been substantially extended since, with the 1939 Officers&#x27; Mess now used as the Council Chamber. A common layout was used at all RAF stations, so that visiting officers were able to find their way around easily.

The brick-built building still shows remnants of the painted camouflage pattern used during the war.

A number of H-block accommodation buildings are also in use as offices.

The control tower - also listed - is largely complete in the form it was in 1942, now surrounded by modern housing, and has been restored for use as a coffee shop.

Situated near the site of the old guard house, a memorial to the personnel stationed at RAF West Malling was unveiled on 9 June 2002. Otto Bechtold, one of the German Fw 190 pilots who had landed in error in 1943, was a guest of honour at the ceremony.

Road names in Kings Hill pay homage to the site&#x27;s past use as a RAF aerodrome, with names such as Typhoon Road, Mosquito Road, Hurricane Road, Spitfire Road, Beaufighter Road, Javelin Road, Lancaster Way, Lysander Road, Meteor Road and Mustang Road, and finally Tower View running past the Control Tower.

Kings Hill Cricket Club is located on what was the main runway and the team are known as the Mosquitos. The club&#x27;s pavilion bar is also known as the hangar. The club badge is the RAF roundels with a Mosquito aircraft. The junior teams are all named after other aircraft that operated out of West Malling.

==Units and aircraft==

The following units were here at some point:
===In popular culture===

Several films and TV programmes, including The Beatles&#x27; 1967 experimental film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, the 1972 television series &quot;Pathfinders&quot; and the 1982 television drama series &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;, used the airfield as a location during production.

Aerial sequences for an episode of the British police TV series Dempsey and Makepeace were filmed here in 1984, involving some spirited flying by a Topflite de Havilland Heron G-ANUO.

West Malling airfield served as a backdrop for the opening sequences of the 1989 &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; episode &quot;The Incredible Theft&quot;, where the T hangar formerly located behind the airfield&#x27;s watch tower (today the site of the Kings Hill Asda store) was emblazoned with the name &quot;Mayfield&quot; and a secret prototype fighter plane, the &quot;Mayfield Kestrel&quot; was revealed then demonstrated by the aircraft&#x27;s builder to a government minister. Filmed with the famous Spitfire IXb MH434 flown by the legendary display pilot Ray Hanna, the sequence is one of the most-memorable of the television drama&#x27;s 70 broadcast episodes.

More recently, the 2007 TV series &quot;Cape Wrath&quot; includes scenes shot at Kings Hill and other local areas.

<text>People Like Us is the stage name of London DJ multimedia artist Vicki Bennett. She has released a number of albums featuring collages of music and sound since 1992. In recent years, she has performed at a number of modern art galleries, festivals and universities.

==Musical career==
Since 1991 Vicki Bennett has been making CDs, radio, and A/V multimedia under the name People Like Us. By animating and recontextualising found footage collages Vicki gives an equally witty and dark view of popular culture with a surrealistic edge.

Vicki has shown work at, amongst others, Tate Modern, The National Film Theatre, Purcell Room, The ICA, Sydney Opera House, Pompidou Centre, Sonar in Barcelona, The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the BBC and Channel 4. She has also performed radio sessions for the BBC&#x27;s John Peel, Mixing It, and also CBC, KPFA and many more in the US. There have been features in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, BBC website and &quot;Bizarre Magazine&quot;. People Like Us have been commissioned by The Arts Council England, The BBC, Sonic Arts Network, Forma, LUX and Lovebytes amongst others.

==Recordings==
PLU has been released on labels such as Tigerbeat6, Soleilmoon, Sonic Arts Network, Touch, Staalplaat and For Us Records (Rough Trade), both solo, and also collaborating with Matmos, Ergo Phizmiz, Wobbly, members of Negativland and Christian Marclay.

Spring 2008 saw a Retrospective of People Like Us at alt.gallery and a PLU curated CD entitled Smiling Through My Teeth, with Sonic Arts Network. The June 2008 edition of The Wire featured a 4-page interview, and the July edition featured a review of Smiling Through My Teeth.

In June 2010, she released the album &quot;Music for the Fire&quot; with Wobbly on the Illegal Art label.

==Performance and multimedia work==
Vicki completed the Great North Run Moving Image Commission 2009, and a live A/V set premiered in October 2009 at Vancouver New Music Festival. The UK premiere was performed at BFI Southbank in December 2009.

Vicki worked on a commission for Edinburgh Printmakers as part of the exhibition &quot;Prints of Darkness&quot;, coinciding with Edinburgh Art Festival in July 2010. People Like Us recently curated &quot;Nothing Is New, Everything Is Permitted&quot; at AV Festival, and will soon perform concerts of &quot;Genre Collage&quot; at MACBA, Liverpool Sound City, Bristol Arnolfini, Copenhagen and Jerusalem.

In January 2015 her audiovisual performance Citation City premiered at transmediale, Berlin at Haus der Kulturen der Welt. Inspired by The Arcades Project by Walter Benjamin, this audiovisual work is created from thousands of clippings of text and visual media, collaged using a system of “convolutes”, collated around subjects of key motifs, historical figures, social types, cultural objects from the time.

==DO or DIY==
People Like Us has programmed &quot;DO or DIY&quot;, an experimental arts radio and podcast show, on WFMU since 2003. The show appears weekly on a seasonal basis. WFMU has also created a 24-hour-per-day radio stream of sound collage and music chosen by Bennett.

<text>Tairua is a beachside town located on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand in the Thames-Coromandel District. It is located 150 kilometres (93 miles) east of Auckland and 125 kilometers (78 miles) north of Tauranga. It lies at the mouth of the Tairua River on its north bank and on the small Paku Peninsula. As the 2023 census, the town had a permanent population of 1,630. Tairua is a Māori name which translates literally as &quot;tai&quot;: tides, &quot;rua&quot;: two.

Directly opposite Tairua on the south bank of the river&#x27;s estuary is the smaller settlement of Pauanui. The two settlements are 30 kilometres east of Thames although the town has closer connections with the sea side resort town Whangamatā. Several islands lie off the mouth of the river, notably Slipper Island to the southeast and the Aldermen Islands 20 kilometres to the east. Mount Paku is an extinct volcano that lies by Tairua Harbour. It was thought to have formed the Alderman Islands.

== History and features ==
The earliest occupation of the area was once thought to have been by early Polynesian explorers based on the discovery of a pearl-shell (not native to New Zealand) lure shank found here and originally carbon-dated to the 11th century. Subsequent reassessment of the archaeological site has resulted in dates in the 14th century.

In 1769, Lieutenant James Cook sailed past the coast of Tairua, and named many of the off shore islands after members of his crew and the shapes of the islands. European settlement first took place in the 1830s.

Early European settlers to the area, in the late 19th century, were primarily drawn by timber stocks (predominantly kauri) and gold prospecting.

From the late 1960s Tairua has become a holiday destination, with major activities including game fishing, scuba diving, and surfing.

Radio Tairua is an independent radio station on frequency 88.3FM, which has broadcast to the area since May 2007.

The local Oturu Marae is located in Tairua. It is a tribal meeting ground for Ngāti Rautao and includes the Ngatau Wiwi meeting house.

==Demographics==
Tairua covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Tairua had a population of 1,479 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 252 people (20.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 213 people (16.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 636 households, comprising 747 males and 732 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.02 males per female. The median age was 56.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 213 people (14.4%) aged under 15 years, 123 (8.3%) aged 15 to 29, 624 (42.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 516 (34.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.9% European/Pākehā, 11.6% Māori, 2.2% Pacific peoples, 4.7% Asian, and 2.0% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 22.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.7% had no religion, 33.7% were Christian, 0.8% had Māori religious beliefs, 1.0% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 1.0% were Buddhist and 2.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 225 (17.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 240 (19.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $25,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. 129 people (10.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 465 (36.7%) people were employed full-time, 195 (15.4%) were part-time, and 27 (2.1%) were unemployed.

==Climate==

Tairua features an extremely mild oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) with no month having an average temperature above 20 °C or below 10 °C. As a result of this, temperatures above 30 °C or below 0 °C are almost unheard of with the town being a popular holiday location because of its mild weather, beautiful beaches and rugged hills and mountains. These surrounding hills and mountains also cause the city to see significant rainfall throughout the year, especially in winter which can often lead to flooding and slips which isolate the community (almost annually) for a day or two at a time. This high rainfall also leads to lush temperate rainforest vegetation surrounding the city.

== Tourism ==
The town is a resort popular with domestic tourists, especially people who own a bach in the town. It has several beaches around the town that are popular for surfing and the harbour attracts kayaking and jet skiing. A pathway allows visitors to walk from the centre of town to the top of Mt Paku.

The area is noted for its fishing, with big kahawai, snapper and kingfish being the most prominent fish in the waters surrounding the town. The abundance of rocky islands also make Tairua a popular place for scuba diving and snorkelling. Most diving is done at the Alderman Islands, 20 kilometres from the town and is stated as a marine reserve. Native rainforests are nearby, and areas such as the Coromandel Forest Park and its Broken Hills are within easy reach of the town.

==Education==
Tairua School is a coeducational full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of as of 

Central Kids Tairua Kindergarten provides early childhood education for tamariki aged 2–5 years.

<text>West Malling ( , historically Town Malling) is a market town in the Tonbridge and Malling district of Kent, England. It has a population of 2,590.

==Landmarks==
West Malling contains several historic buildings, including St Leonard&#x27;s Tower, a Norman keep built by Bishop Gundulf (bishop between 1077 and 1108). He also built the White Tower of the Tower of London, the castles of Rochester and Colchester, and the Priory and Cathedral of Rochester. In c.1090, Gundulf founded St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey in West Malling for Benedictine nuns. This historic site contains significant buildings from the Norman, medieval, Tudor and Georgian eras. There is also a Grade II* listed 1966 abbey church which is used by the Anglican Benedictine nuns, who have made Malling Abbey their home since 1916.

Other buildings of interest in West Malling include the Prior&#x27;s House, once a residence for those with leprosy; Ford House, over 600 years old; a mainly Georgian High Street; the Swan Hotel, an 18th-century coaching inn (Grade II listed); and Went House, built c.1720 and noted for its elegant brickwork. Manor Park Country Park is just to the south of the town, close to St Leonard&#x27;s Tower and Douce&#x27;s Manor, whose grounds the park once comprised.

In about 1791, the artist J. M. W. Turner painted a watercolour of &#x27;St Mary&#x27;s Abbey and an ornamental waterfall&#x27; on Swan St, that remains in place today.

Places of worship include the Anglican St Mary&#x27;s Church and West Malling Baptist Church, built in 1836.

==Kings Hill==
This new parish is a mixed residential housing estate and commercial development formed from parts of West Malling, Mereworth, East Malling and Wateringbury. The 2004 &quot;Wealth of the Nation&quot; report lists Kings Hill as having the highest average income and the highest proportion of households earning more than £100,000 per annum in Great Britain.

==Transport==

West Malling is some 35 miles (56 km) from central London, next to the main road between London and the coastal ferry ports of Folkestone and Dover. There are good links by road and rail; the area has become a popular commuter location.

===Railway===
West Malling station is a stop on the Kent Downs line, situated on the outskirts of the town. Southeastern Trains provides a regular service between , and ; journeys into London take around one hour.

With the recent development of Kings Hill, the station is sometimes known as &quot;West Malling for Kings Hill&quot;; road access was provided in 2007 from the West Malling bypass, taking commuter traffic away from the High Street.

===Road===
The town was established originally on the main road between London and the Kent coast. West Malling is sited about from junction 4 of the M20 and from junction 2 of the M26, which leads on to the M25 &quot;London Orbital&quot; motorway.

===Buses===
Bus services are provided predominantly Arriva Kent and Surrey and Nu-Venture. Routes connect the town with Chatham, Maidstone, Rochester and Tunbridge Wells.

===Air===

In the 1930s, Maidstone Airport was established two miles from the town, at King Hill. During the Second World War, RAF fighters were posted to the then-named RAF West Malling and several US Navy squadrons were located there during the 1960s. After closure as an operational airfield in 1967, several commercial air-based activities moved onto the site and a number of popular airshows took place; the last was in 1987. By then, work had started to convert the area to non-flying use, developing into the new parish of Kings Hill.

== Healthcare ==
Kent Nursing Institute was founded in 1875 in West Malling as a private nursing service; it also had a branch in Tunbridge Wells. Funding was sourced via charitable donations, subscriptions and one-off payments. There was a nursing institute in West Malling from at least 1881 until the end of the First World War. 

In 1881, Eva Luckes, Matron of The London Hospital was asked to train some probationers from the institute ward based training at The London. Nurses were awarded five (bronze) and ten (silver) badges for long service. 

The Tunbridge Wells branch was in Crescent Road and was an auxiliary hospital during the First World War, with beds for civilians and soldiers.

=== Notable staff ===
* Agnes Theodosia Kelly (1863–1929) was Lady Superintendent / matron of the West Malling branch between 1902 and 1916. Kelly trained at The London Hospital under Luckes between 1889 and 1891. Kelly was also Lady Superintendent of Kent VAD Hospital 150, based in West Malling, Kent until at least January 1919.

==Local media==
===Newspapers===
West Malling is covered by the Malling edition of the &quot;Kent Messenger&quot;, published by the KM Group. There is also a King&#x27;s Hill edition of the &quot;Sevenoaks Chronicle&quot;.

===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter, BBC London and ITV London can also be received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter.

===Radio===
The local radio station for West Malling is KMFM Maidstone. The county-wide stations BBC Radio Kent, Heart South and Gold can also be received in the town.

==Sport==
West Malling is reputed to be the site of the first recorded cricket match in Kent. The Old County Ground, off Norman Road, was once the home of inter-county cricket in Kent; it is known that in 1705, &quot;West of Kent&quot; played Chatham at Malling.

The setting for the cricket match between All Muggleton and Dingley Dell, in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, is reputed to be based on an amalgamation of the grounds at West Malling and Maidstone. There is a resemblance to West Malling in the original illustration of the match, a version of which featured on the back of the £10 banknote featuring Dickens, first circulated on 29 April 1992. Dickens, however, was a regular visitor to Dingley Hall in the village of Dingley, Northamptonshire. Here he would have encountered an annual cricket match against a team formed of men with the name Muggleton, from the next village of Wilbaston. Dingley Dell is an area just south of the village, steep and wooded which may instead have been the model for Dickens&#x27; &quot;Dingley Dell&quot;.

King&#x27;s Hill golf course was founded in 1995 and is open to guests and visitors.

==Cultural references==
In 1967, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was filmed around West Malling, including in the High Street and at the airfield.

===Founding and first customers===
On November 11, 1911, Louis Upton (1886–1952), who worked as an insurance salesman, and his uncle, Emory Upton, who owned a machine shop, founded the Upton Machine Company. Following a failed business venture, Lou acquired a patent to a manual clothes washer. He approached Emory to determine if he could add an electric motor to the design. With the aid of a $5,000 investment from retailing executive Lowell Bassford, they began producing electric motor-driven wringer washers. Soon after its founding, Lou&#x27;s younger brother Fred joined the company.

Their first customer, the Federal Electric division of Commonwealth Edison, ordered 100 machines, but a fault in the gear transmission led the customer to threaten their return. After the machines were recalled and repaired, Federal Electric doubled the order. They remained a customer for three years, then they began producing their own washers. The loss of Federal Electric forced Upton to diversify until, in 1916, they landed Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. as a customer. Sears began selling two types of Upton wringer washers under the &quot;Allen&quot; brand, one for $54.75 and a deluxe model for $95. Sales grew quickly, and in 1921 Sears appointed Upton as their sole supplier of washers. To avoid becoming over-reliant on Sears, Upton began marketing a washer under their own brand name.

The increasing volume of sales led Upton to merge with the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company of Binghamton, New York in 1929, adopting the name Nineteen Hundred Corporation. The company was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression. During WWII, its factories were converted to armament production. In 1947, it introduced an automatic, spinner-type washer sold by Sears under the &quot;Kenmore&quot; brand. A year later it was sold by the company under the &quot;Whirlpool&quot; brand name. Lou retired as president in 1949 and was replaced by Elisha &quot;Bud&quot; Gray II.

In response to the post-war consumer demand for convenience products, the company launched a range of home laundry products including wringer and automatic washers, dryers, and irons. In 1949, The Nineteen Hundred Corporation was renamed as the Whirlpool Corporation. In 1951, the philanthropic Whirlpool Foundation was established.

===1950s to 1980s: Early acquisitions===

To better compete with more diversified manufacturers, in 1955 Whirlpool acquired Seeger Refrigerator Company and RCA&#x27;s air conditioner and cooking range lines. The company changed its name to Whirlpool-Seeger Corporation and began using the RCA-Whirlpool brand name. Whirlpool acquired International Harvester Company&#x27;s refrigeration plant in Evansville, IN in 1955. In 1956, a administrative center was opened in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In 1957, the RCA Whirlpool Miracle Kitchen was introduced with an estimated 15 million television viewers. The company changed its name back to Whirlpool Corporation and brought in Robert Elton Brooker as president. At the 1959 American National Exhibition at Sokolniki Park, Moscow, Brooker presided over the Whirlpool kitchen. The Whirlpool kitchen inspired the Kitchen Debate between then Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

In 1966, Whirlpool dropped the RCA name, with the brand then being known as Whirlpool. The following year, the company introduced a 24-hour helpline. Also in 1966, Whirlpool purchased Warwick Electronics, a major television producer for Sears. The purchase also included the division Thomas Organ Company. Whirlpool exited the television market in 1976 by selling the operations to Japan&#x27;s Sanyo Electronic Co., but retained the organ business for the electronic technology. By 1978, annual revenues exceeded $2 billion.

In 1986, Whirlpool acquired KitchenAid, a division of the Hobart Corporation. It also announced that it would close most of its manufacturing facilities in the St. Joseph, Michigan area by the end of 1988.

===1980s to 2000s: International Expansion===
In 1987, Whirlpool began selling compact washers in India and acquired a majority interest in Inglis of Canada. In 1988, Whirlpool bought a 53% stake in the large-appliance division of Philips N.V., creating a joint venture called Whirlpool International. The purchase made Whirlpool the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of major appliances, with annual sales of approximately $6 billion. The remaining 47% stake was purchased from Philips in 1991, completing the acquisition. In 1989, Whirlpool acquired the Roper brand and Bauknecht of Germany.

Whirlpool entered the Indian market in the late 1980s as part of its global expansion strategy. It founded a joint venture with the TVS Group and established the first Whirlpool manufacturing facility in Puducherry, where it manufactured washing machines. In 1995, Whirlpool acquired Kelvinator India Limited, marking an entry into the refrigerator market as well. That same year, the company acquired major shares in TVS joint venture, and in 1996, the Kelvinator and TVS acquisitions were merged to create Whirlpool of India Limited. This expanded the company&#x27;s portfolio on the Indian subcontinent to include washing machines, refrigerators, microwave ovens, and air conditioners. Whirlpool of India Limited is headquartered in Gurgaon, and it owns three manufacturing facilities at Faridabad, Puducherry and Pune.

In 1997, the company acquired a majority stake in Embraco, a Brazilian maker of compressors for refrigeration. In 2000, it acquired Brazilian appliance maker Multibrás, owner of the brands Brastemp and Consul, including its stake in Embraco. In 2001, Inglis Ltd. changed its name to Whirlpool Canada. Whirlpool continues to market Inglis appliances to this day.

===2000s to present: Growth and closures===
By 2004, annual revenues exceeded $13 billion. In 2005, Maytag Corporation shareholders voted to accept Whirlpool Corporation&#x27;s stock purchase. After the U.S. Justice Department approved the merger in 2006, the company acquired Maytag, including the Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Jade, Magic Chef, Admiral, Hoover, and Dixie-Narco brands. It sold Dixie-Narco to Crane Co., and Amana Commercial to AGA.

In 2007, Whirlpool sold Hoover to Techtronic Industries, TTI Floorcare, and Jade Appliances to Middleby Corporation. It also closed plants in Newton, Iowa, Searcy, Arkansas, and Herrin, Illinois, resulting in the loss of 4,500 jobs in the affected communities. In 2008, Whirlpool announced the closure of plants in La Vergne, Tennessee, Reynosa, Mexico, Oxford, Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.

In 2009, Whirlpool acquired WC Woods from bankruptcy and closed the company&#x27;s Evansville, Indiana plant.

In 2011, Whirlpool celebrated its 100th anniversary and unveiled its 100th anniversary logo and an updated corporate logo.
It also took over the former KarstadtQuelle brand Privileg from Otto GmbH.

In 2011, Whirlpool announced the closure of the Fort Smith Arkansas plant. The following year Whirlpool opened a manufacturing plant in Cleveland, Tennessee replacing a 123-year-old facility. The $200 million project added about 130 jobs to an established workforce of 1,500. The facility manufactures premium cooking appliances for Whirlpool&#x27;s portfolio of brands. The project includes a distribution center.

In August 2013, Whirlpool announced it would acquire a 51% majority stake in China&#x27;s Hefei Royalstar Sanyo (a joint venture between Japan&#x27;s Sanyo Electric Co, now a unit of Panasonic Corp, and Hefei State-Owned Assets Holding Company Ltd, the investment arm of the local state government) for $552 million and give the company leverage to expand in the Chinese appliance market.

In July 2014, Whirlpool announced it would pay €758 million ($1 billion) to buy a 60% stake in the 
Italian rival Indesit. In December Whirlpool completed a successful mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares and de-listed Indesit from the Milan Stock Exchange, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Whirlpool Italia Holdings S.r.l.

In January 2017, Whirlpool announced that it would cut about 500 jobs from its Europe, Middle East, and Africa dryer manufacturing units by 2018. This decision provides the closure of the plant in Amiens, France, which became an issue in the 2017 French presidential election, with both Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron visiting the workers on strike before the second round.

In October 2017, Whirlpool and retailer Sears Holding Corp. reportedly ended their 101-year old association that allowed Whirlpool branded appliances to be sold at Sears stores, and later at Kmart. The companies reportedly were unable to come to an agreement on pricing issues. Whirlpool will continue to supply Kenmore appliances manufactured for Sears.

In March 2020, Whirlpool Corporation announced the official opening of a new Factory Distribution Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

In November 2022, Whirlpool acquired the Wisconsin-based garbage disposal manufacturer InSinkErator.

April 2024 - Merger with Arçelik A.Ş.(controlling the brand Beko) 

Whirlpool Corporation and Arçelik A.Ş. completed a merger on April 2, 2024, to create Beko Europe B.V., a new European appliance company: 
Beko Europe: The new company has over 20,000 employees and can produce around 24 million home appliances per year. It combines the European appliance businesses of both companies, including brands like Hotpoint and Indesit. 
Ownership: Arçelik owns 75% of Beko Europe, and Whirlpool owns 25%. 
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approval: The CMA provisionally approved the deal in February 2024, and confirmed its final approval in March 2024. The CMA was concerned that the merger could reduce competition, leading to higher prices or lower quality products. However, the CMA&#x27;s final report found that the deal would not likely result in a substantial lessening of competition in the UK. 
The merger is expected to create value for European consumers by combining the companies&#x27; manufacturing expertise, distribution networks, and product pipelines. 

Supermicro will replace Whirlpool in the S&amp;P 500 starting at market open March 18, 2024. It was possible after the sequential decline in Whirlpool&#x27;s market cap, from 14,2B in the end of 2021 to less than 6B in March 2024.

==Carbon footprint==
Whirlpool Corporation reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 663 Kt (-21 /-3.1% y-o-y) and is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2030.

==NASA partnership==

In 1962, the company&#x27;s research laboratories won a contract from NASA to develop the food and waste management system for Project Gemini. The company later developed freeze-dried ice cream in 1968 under contract to NASA for the Apollo missions. Returning to work with NASA under the Johnson Space Center&#x27;s Advanced Exploration Systems Logistics Reduction and Repurposing project in 2021, Whirlpool developed a zero-gravity refrigerator in partnership with Purdue University and Air Squared to investigate long term food storage for deep space exploration.

==Dryer fire scandal==

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper the Whirlpool Corporation was mired in controversy in the UK for its decision not to recall faulty items that have caused deadly fires. On October 10, 2014, Bernard Hender, 19, and Doug McTavish, 39, died following a fire at a flat in Llanrwst, North Wales. Coroner Dave Lewis ruled that the cause of the fire was “on the balance of probabilities” an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. He described the evidence presented at the inquest by Whirlpool as “defensive and dismissive” and stated the company&#x27;s approach was an “obstacle” to finding steps to prevent future fires.

Safety warnings about tumble dryers published on the Indesit and Hotpoint websites in 2015 advised customers that “In some rare cases, excess fluff can come into contact with the heating element and present a risk of fire.” Condensers and vented tumble dryers sold under the brands Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline and manufactured over an 11-year period between April 2004 and September 2015 present a fire risk. An estimated 5.3 million tumble dryers were bought in the UK over the time period. Originally, and even after several fires were confirmed as being caused by faulty devices, Whirlpool advised customers that using such devices was safe provided they were not left unattended but would not issue a product recall. Whirlpool offered to fix faulty machines or replace tumble dryers at a cost of £99 - an offer met with derision with consumer groups and in the press. Parliament discussed widespread difficulties with getting faulty machines fixed or replaced, including long wait times and poor service.

On Friday 19 August 2016, a fire broke out on the seventh floor of an 18-storey Shepherds Court building in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green resulting in hundreds of residents being evacuated. London Fire Brigade said 20 fire engines and 120 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at 3.44pm, and that it was under control by 5.30pm. The occupants were at home when smoke started pouring out of the tumble dryer and they alerted fire crews, with the fire later confirmed as being caused by a faulty Indesit branded Whirlpool tumble dryer.

At the time Whirlpool advised customers that ”You may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification, however, we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation as an extra precaution (i.e. do not leave the house or leave the dryer on whilst asleep)” but would not issue a product recall.

On 26 August 2016, London Fire Brigade advised the public to stop all use of faulty tumble dryers immediately and through its Total Recall campaign, called on Whirlpool to change its advice to customers and promote a product recall, advice also issued by Which? and the &quot;Expect It&#x27;s Safe&quot; campaign set up by lawyers representing victims of fires started by faulty appliances. The London Fire Brigade commented that they get called out to a fire started by faulty domestic appliances nearly once every day and issued a five-point notice concerning Whirlpool&#x27;s advice on faulty appliances:
# The safety notice was issued due to the danger of fire and any fire has the potential to endanger life and property.
# It&#x27;s impractical for most people to remain with an appliance for the duration of a drying cycle.
# If the dryer does catch fire while it&#x27;s attended this still presents a risk to the occupants.
# If the owner attempts to put out a fire in an appliance they could be putting their life at risk. The Brigade&#x27;s advice is to not risk tackling the fire, always raise the alarm, get out, stay out and call 999.
# The time a fire may break out because of a fault is unpredictable. The ignition of fluff accumulated around a heating element may cause a smouldering fire which might not be discovered until the appliance has finished being used and the owner has gone to bed.

In September 2016, Andy Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith whose constituency includes Shepherd&#x27;s Bush said the government had failed to stand up to the “powerful industry lobby” representing white goods manufacturers. He was reported to have urged ministers to instruct Whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers, and insisted that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced. In a session of parliament on 13 September 2016, Slaughter revealed that he had &quot;tracked down 750 fires caused by Whirlpool dryers and by dryers from brands owned by Whirlpool between 2004 and 2015. We know about 127 models, but Whirlpool will not publish the full list.&quot;

The same month, following the publication of the investigation results into the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the UK, pressure grew on Whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public. Dave Brown, London fire brigade&#x27;s director of operations, said, “This fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be... disappointingly though, Whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers. We are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own. Thankfully there were no serious injuries in the Shepherd’s Bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again.”

In October 2016, Margot James, the government&#x27;s consumer minister, said: “Customer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers. I acknowledge that Whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace at-risk machines, but I believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public. I will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations.”

In December 2016, the UK&#x27;s largest customer advocacy group, Which?, who had previously produced a list of the 113 models of tumble dryer at risk, took the unusual step to seeking a judicial review of Peterborough Trading Standards - the agency named as responsible for handling of the faulty tumble dryers sold by Whirlpool - labelling the handling as a “fiasco” and claiming that it has failed millions of consumers across the UK by not enforcing product safety laws. Peterborough City Council had been dealing with Whirlpool because its UK head office is located in the city. The move was considered unusual as it was the first time Which? had made a formal legal move involving trading standards &quot;in order to assess the lawfulness of its decision to allow householders to continue to use faulty machines, despite the risk of them bursting into flames&quot;.

Leon Livermore, Chief Executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute was critical of Whirlpool not recalling faulty tumble dryers, urging &quot;Whirlpool to recall the millions of potentially faulty tumble dryers in people&#x27;s homes&quot;, but came to the defence of Peterborough Trading Standards, saying, &quot;The whole system has been overwhelmed by the size of this, and it’s a bit unfair on a local authority such as Peterborough to have to take responsibility for what is a national issue.”

In response to the criticism, a council spokesman said: “An independent review, which began earlier this month, is currently taking place and we would expect the company to fully comply with the outcome. We will strongly defend our position if Which? is granted a judicial review and bearing in mind the ongoing independent review we consider that this action is premature.”

On 22 February 2017, Whirlpool received two enforcement notices from Peterborough Trading Standards following the trading standards internal review. 15 months after Whirlpool advised customers that it was safe to continue using faulty tumble dryers providing they were not left unattended, it was required to update its advice to customers advising them to unplug the appliances and stop using them until they were repaired. Whirlpool was also required to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers, through social media and in stores. The enforcement notices had been originally issued on 16 January 2017, and were rejected by Whirlpool, which filed for an appeal that was then rejected. Had the company not complied with the notices at this point, it would have been taken to court. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the latest action followed “an escalation” in the number of incidents caused by affected machines.

On Wednesday 25 April 2018, BBC One television consumer show Watchdog broadcast further allegations regarding Whirlpool&#x27;s safety recall of tumble dryers. The show explained how tumble dryers that had already been modified and supposedly made safe were still catching fire. Furthermore, newer models which were deemed “safe” by Whirlpool were actually being manufactured with the same flaws of previous unsafe models. BBC Watchdog attempted to speak to a spokesman from Whirlpool but the company did not provide anyone to answer these allegations on the show.

On 17 December 2019, Whirlpool issued a recall of over 500,000 Hotpoint- and Indesit-branded washing machines due to risk of fire. The machines were demonstrated to be prone to overheating and catching fire due to a fault with their heating apparatus.

<doc id="1171854" wikidata="Q3533333" url="?curid=1171854" title="Shri Rudram">
<text>Shri Rudram ( ), is a Vedic mantra or chant in homage to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva) taken from the &quot;Krishna Yajurveda&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; (TS 4.5, 4.7). In Shukla Yajurveda, it is found in Chapters 16 and 18. It is composed of two parts: the &quot;Namakam&quot; and &quot;Chamakam&quot;. &quot;Chamakam&quot; () is added by scriptural tradition to the &quot;Shri Rudram&quot;. The text is important in Shaivism, where Shiva is viewed as the Parabrahman. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity.

&quot;Shri Rudram&quot; is also famous for its mention of the Shaivite holy mantra &quot;Namah Shivaya&quot;, which appears in the text of the [[Shri Rudram|&#x27; in the eighth &quot;anuvāka&quot; of [[Taittiriya Shakha|&quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot;]] (TS 4.5.8.1). In Shukla Yajurveda it is found in chapter 16, verse 41. It also contains the mantra &quot;Aum namo bhagavate rudraya&quot; and the &quot;[[Mahamrityunjaya Mantra]]&quot;.

The Sri Rudram is commonly chanted during the &quot;[[Pradosha]]&quot; time, which is considered to be a time auspicious for the worship of Shiva.
There are some popular expiatory rites such as rudraikādaśinī, mahārudra and atirudra which employ the Shree Rudra mantra exclusively for pūjā japa and homa.

There are three major commentaries in Sanskrit for the Shree Rudra mantra (śatarudrīya) -those of Sāyaṇa Bhaṭṭabhāskara and Abhinavaśaṅkara. 

==Contents==
&quot;Shri Rudram&quot; consists of two chapters (&quot;praśna&quot;) from the fourth &quot;kāṇda&quot; (book) of [[Taittiriya Shakha|&quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot;]] which is a part of [[Yajurveda|&quot;Krishna Yajurveda&quot;]]. The names of the chapters are &quot;Namakam&quot; (chapter five) and &quot;Chamakam&quot; (chapter seven) respectively. The &quot;Namakam&quot; (chapter five) in &quot;Shri Rudram&quot; describes the names or epithets of [[Rudra]], who is a fear-inducing/destructive aspect of [[Shiva]]. The devotee asks for the benevolent and graceful aspect of Shiva to be invoked rather than the terrible and fierce aspect of [[Rudra]] and requests for the forgiveness of sins. The &quot;Chamakam&quot; (chapter seven) asks for the fulfillment of wishes. Each chapter consist of eleven &quot;anuvākas&quot; or hymns.

* &quot;Namakam:&quot; The Namakam in particular enumerates the various epithets and names of Rudra. It recognises the violent aspects of Rudra and requests him to be benevolent and peaceful, rather than violent and destructive. It also acknowledges the presence of the deity in those from all walks of life, be they carpenters (TS 4.5.1.2) or thieves (TS 4.5.3.2).

* &quot;Chamakam:&quot; The Chamakam enumerates the various things one would want in life and requests Rudra to grant them to the devotee. It acknowledges both material and spiritual desires and requests the deity for both. Some verses invoke other deities such as Agni and Vishnu and request them to join in the devotee&#x27;s prayers to Rudra.
The &quot;anuvākas&quot; or hymns of &quot;Namakam&quot; correspond to the eleven hymns of TS 4.5, with the final hymn extended by an additional eight verses, including the &quot;[[Mahamrityunjaya Mantra]]&quot;. The mantra &quot;[[Om Namah Shivaya]]&quot; is derived from the &quot;Shri Rudram&quot;, in which it appears in the verses of TS 4.5.8 though without the syllable &quot;Om&quot;. The &quot;Chamakam&quot; consists of 11 &quot;anuvākas&quot; or hymns. The 11th anuvāka prayer (of the chamakam), brings out the long list of benedictions asked for in the odd divine number and even human numbering .The &quot;anuvākas&quot; or hymns of &quot;Chamakam&quot; correspond to TS 4.7 and they ask God for fulfillment of wishes.

The earliest homage hymns to Rudra is the &quot;Śatarudrīya&quot; found in the &quot;[[Shukla Yajurveda]]&quot; (Vajasaneyi Samhita 16.1-66). C. Fuller maintains that &quot;Shri Rudram&quot; is based on &quot;Śatarudrīya&quot;.

<doc id="1171859" wikidata="Q1118229" url="?curid=1171859" title="Lord Nelson-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; class consisted of a pair of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the twentieth century. Although they were the last British pre-dreadnoughts, both were completed and commissioned well over a year after had entered service in late 1906. and were assigned to the Home Fleet when completed in 1908, with the former ship often serving as a flagship. The sister ships were transferred to the Channel Fleet when the First World War began in August 1914. They were transferred to the Mediterranean Sea in early 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign.

They remained there after the end of that campaign in 1916 and were assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, which was later redesignated the Aegean Squadron, to prevent the ex-German battlecruiser and her consort, the light cruiser , from breaking out into the Mediterranean from the Dardanelles, although neither ship was present when the German ships made that attempt in early 1918. Both ships participated in the Occupation of Constantinople in November following the Armistice of Mudros which ended Turkish participation in the war. The sisters returned home in mid-1919 and were placed into reserve upon their arrival. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; sold for scrap in 1920, but &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was converted into a radio-controlled target ship that year and continued in that role until being sold for scrap in early 1927, the last surviving British pre-dreadnought.

==Background and design==
Pioneering naval gunnery developments by Captain Percy Scott in the early 1900s were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners to wait for the shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns&#x27; faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.

After being appointed Director of Naval Construction in early 1902, Philip Watts and the Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy, Vice-Admiral William May conducted studies that revealed the destructive power of smaller guns such as the was far smaller than that of larger guns like the . The greater damage inflicted at greater range by larger guns meant that there was a very real chance that the lightly protected smaller guns would be destroyed before they could open fire and that thicker armour was required over a greater area to resist large-calibre shells. 
The Board of Admiralty wished to keep the size of the 1903–1904 Naval Programme battleships to about the of the earlier and also required them to be able to use the drydocks at Chatham, Portsmouth and Devonport, even though these had been enlarged before the ships were completed. This latter requirement severely constrained the length and beam of the design. Preliminary design work began in mid-1902 and it became clear that a displacement at least equal to that of the preceding would be required. Lacking a consensus on the design, May called a conference in November to discuss the way forward. The participants agreed to increase the armour to a maximum of 12 inches and the maximum displacement to , eliminated the three-calibre gun armament that had proven so unpopular in the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s in favour of a mix of 12-inch and guns, and rejected the version armed with only guns proposed by Watts.

The Admiralty formally approved a design armed with four 12-inch and a dozen 9.2-inch guns on 6 August 1903, but revoked it in October when they discovered that it could not be docked at Chatham. As it was now too late to revise the design in time for the 1903–1904 Programme, the Admiralty ordered three more &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships instead. Watts refined the design to ensure that it could enter the Chatham docks, which required reducing the number of 9.2-inch guns to only 10, and it was approved on 10 February 1904. A planned third ship of the class was cancelled due to financial pressures arising from the purchase of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot;-class battleships.

==Description==

The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of and an extra deep load draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; had a metacentric height of at extra deep load. The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; class &quot;proved good seaboats and steady gun platforms, with excellent manoeuvrabiling qualities.&quot; Their crew numbered 749–756 officers and ratings in peacetime and averaged 800 men during the war.

The ships were powered by a pair of four-cylinder inverted vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one four-bladed, screw, using steam provided by fifteen water-tube boilers that operated at a pressure of . The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The engines, rated at , were intended to give a maximum speed of , but both ships slightly exceeded their design speed, reaching during their sea trials. The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;s were the first British battleships to be built with fuel oil sprayers to increase the burn rate of the coal. They carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil in tanks in their double bottom. At a cruising speed of , the ships had a range of burning only coal and using coal and oil.

===Armament===

The main armament of the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;-class ships consisted of four 45-calibre breech-loading (BL) 12-inch Mark X guns in a pair of twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. The guns had a maximum elevation of +13.5° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried 80 shells per gun.

Their secondary armament consisted of ten 50-calibre BL 9.2-inch Mk XI guns. They were mounted in four twin-gun turrets positioned at the corners of the superstructure and a pair of single-gun turrets amidships. The guns were limited to an elevation of +15° which gave their shells a range of . They had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum rate of fire of four rounds per minute. Each gun was provided with 100 rounds. For defence against torpedo boats, the ships carried two dozen 50-calibre quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 18 cwt guns in single mounts in the superstructure. At an elevation of +20°, their muzzle velocity gave the guns a range of with their projectiles. The ships were also fitted with 10 QF 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns, two in the superstructure and the others on the turret roofs. They were equipped with five submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern, and carried 23 torpedoes for them.

===Armour===

The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;s″ armour scheme was derived from that of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class, although the vertical armour was generally thicker and the deck armour slightly thinner. The waterline main belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour (KCA) 12-inches thick, although it thinned to at its lower edge. It was high of which was below the waterline at normal load. The thickest portion of the belt extended for approximately amidships, from the rear of the forward 12-inch barbette to abreast the rear main-gun barbette. It was thick from there to the stern while the portion abreast the forward barbette was thick and then reduced to 6 inches to the bow. Below the belt at the stem, a strake of armour projected downwards to support the ship&#x27;s plow-type ram. The middle strake consisted of armour plates; it continued forward to the bow, albeit in 6- then 4-inch thicknesses. Aft it terminated in an oblique 8-inch bulkhead that connected the armour to the aft barbette. The upper strake of armour was also 8 inches thick, but only covered the area between the main-gun barbettes with oblique bulkheads of the same thickness connecting the side armour to the barbettes to form the armoured citadel.

The main gun turret faces and sides were 12 inches thick and their roofs were protected by 3- and 4-inch plates. Their barbettes also had 12 inches of armour on their external faces down to the main deck. Below this the forward barbette&#x27;s armour reduced to 8 inches down to the middle deck while the aft barbette retained its full thickness down to the middle deck. The inner faces of the barbettes were 3 or 4 inches thick for the forward barbette and 3 inches thick for the aft barbette. The 9.2-inch gun turret faces had 8-inch armour plating, their sides were thick and they had 2-inch thick roofs. The turrets sat on 6-inch thick armoured bases and their ammunition hoists were protected by 2-inch armoured tubes.

The upper deck over the citadel was thick and the main deck forward of the citadel to the bow had a thickness of inches. The middle deck inside the citadel was thick on the flat, but 2 inches thick where it sloped downwards to meet the bottom edge of the waterline belt. The lower deck was 4 inches thick where it sloped upwards to meet the bases of the main-gun barbettes, but was otherwise 1 inch thick forward of the citadel. Aft it ranged in thickness from 2 inches on the flat and 3 inches on the slope to protect the steering gear. The forward conning tower was protected by 12 inches of armour on its sides and it had a 3-inch roof. The aft conning tower had 3-inch armour plates all around. The &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;s were the first British ships fitted with unpierced watertight bulkheads for all main compartments with access gained by using lifts. In service the inconvenience of this feature for the crew, especially in the engine and boiler rooms, led to its abandonment in the next generation of battleships.

Naval historian R. A. Burt assessed the greatest weaknesses of their armour scheme as the waterline belt being submerged at deep load and the reduction in the thickness of the barbette armour below the upper deck. He believed that this made the ships&#x27; magazines vulnerable to plunging fire from long range.

===Modifications===

Modifications to the sisters before 1920 were relatively minor. In 1909 the number of 3-pounders was reduced to four in &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and two in &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;. In 1910–1911 a rangefinder was installed of the roof of the forward turret in both ships and another was added to the spotting top in &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. The following year &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; had her spotting top modified to accommodate one as well. In 1913–1914 the ship had an additional rangefinder added to her bridge. The remaining 3-pounders were removed from the ships in 1914–1915 as were the rooftop and bridge rangefinders. A pair of 12-pounders were removed from the after superstructure in exchange for a pair of 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns on high-angle mounts. In 1916–1917, four 12-pounders were removed from the forward superstructure in &quot;Agamemnon&quot; while &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; only lost two. That ship lost two more from her aft superstructure in 1918.

Early in 1919 the Admiralty decided that the Navy needed a radio-controlled target ship to properly train gunnery officers. It conducted tests to evaluate the effectiveness of shells on armour plates as thick as the typical pre-dreadnought deck armour. At an equivalent range of , the plates were completely destroyed and the Admiralty realized that 15-inch shells would do much the same to any of the surplus early dreadnoughts. It then limited all gunnery practice against the target ships to a maximum of 6-inch shells. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was selected as the target ship in 1920 and was modified to suit her new role, including the installation of wireless equipment. She was disarmed and her 9.2-inch gun turrets were removed, but not her main-gun turrets. Most of her internal openings were plated over and much internal equipment was removed. Concerned about her stability with the loss of a lot of topweight, of ballast were added low in the ship and &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was inclined to measure her stability. With a displacement of , the ship had a metacentric height of .

==Service history==

Construction of the ships was seriously delayed when their main-gun turrets were transferred to HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, then under construction, to allow her to be finished more quickly. Both ships commissioned in 1908, the last pre-dreadnoughts in the Royal Navy to do so, and were assigned to the Home Fleet until 1914. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; became flagship of the vice-admiral commanding the Nore Division of the Home Fleet at the beginning of 1909, but became a private ship in early 1914. After the First World War began later that year, the sisters were assigned to the Channel Fleet, with &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; becoming the fleet flagship. The fleet was initially tasked with covering the passage of the British Expeditionary Force across the English Channel. Both ships were transferred to the Mediterranean in 1915 to support Allied forces in the Dardanelles Campaign and to help blockade the German battlecruiser . &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; became flagship of the Dardanelles Squadron, later redesignated as the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron in January 1916 and then the Aegean Squadron in August 1917, a few months after her arrival.
The sisters participated in numerous bombardments of Turkish forts and positions between their arrival in February and May during which they were slightly damaged by Turkish guns. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was withdrawn to Malta for repairs that lasted several months while &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; was repaired locally. After the evacuation of Gallipoli at the beginning of 1916 they were assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron which was tasked to guard against a breakout attempt by &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, now transferred to the Ottoman Navy and renamed &quot;Yavûz Sultân Selîm&quot; and &quot;Mdilli&quot;, respectively, support the Allied forces in the Macedonian front and defend the various Greek islands occupied by the Allies. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; was mostly based in Salonica, Greece, while &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was mainly based at Mudros on the island of Lemnos, although they sometimes alternated. The latter ship shot down the German Zeppelin &quot;LZ85&quot; during a bombing mission over Salonica in mid-1916. When &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; and &quot;Midilli&quot; attempted to sortie into the Mediterranean at the beginning of 1918, neither battleship was able to reach Imbros before the Ottoman ships sank the two monitors based there during the Battle of Imbros. While heading towards Mudros, the ships entered a minefield; &quot;Midilli&quot; sank after striking multiple mines and &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; struck several, but was able to withdraw back to the Dardanelles.

On 30 October 1918 the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on board &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and she participated in the occupation of Constantinople the following month. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; remained there until she returned home in March 1919, while &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; spent a short time in the Black Sea before returning two months later. Both ships were reduced to reserve upon their arrival. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; was sold for scrap in June 1920, but &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1920–1921. She was sold for scrap in her turn in early 1927, the last surviving British pre-dreadnought.

<doc id="1171861" wikidata="Q291745" url="?curid=1171861" title="Ílhavo">
<text>Ílhavo () is a municipality located in the centre of Portugal. The population in 2021 was 39,239, in an area of 73.48 km2.

The Municipality of Ílhavo includes four parishes and two cities: Gafanha da Nazaré and Ílhavo (City). 

==General information==

Several stories have been gathered as part of the history of this city:

Traditionally, the local women — &quot;As ilhavenses&quot; — are famous for their beauty. It is claimed the city was founded by Greek colonists around 400 BC to whom the beauty of &quot;ilhavenses&quot; women is attributed, but others state that the Phoenician settlers are the ones responsible for that.

Ílhavo&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the city of the lamp&quot; (&quot;a cidade da lâmpada&quot;). According to legend, one Sunday during Mass, one of the most important relics of the church (an oil lamp) was stolen in front of everybody and was never found. The myth continued given Ílhavo that nickname.

==Parishes==
Administratively, the municipality is divided into four civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Gafanha da Encarnação
* Gafanha da Nazaré
* Gafanha do Carmo
* Ílhavo (São Salvador)

==Cities and towns==
There are two cities in the municipality.
* Gafanha da Nazaré (city)
* Ílhavo (City)

==Civic information==
The municipality day is Easter Monday.

City hall motto: &quot;The Sea as Tradition&quot;.

==Tourism==

Museums and visitor attractions in the area include the Maritime Museum of Ílhavo, with its Codfish Aquarium, Santo André&#x27;s Ship Museum and the Investigation and Entrepreneurship Centre, one of the most visited across the country, honouring all those who, in the past and the present, dedicate their lives to fishing, either at deep-sea – such as cod fishing – at the coast or at the lagoon, and even to riverside activities. 

Of that same type is the Museum of Vista Alegre, yet today, a symbol for national excellence on the fields of creativity, quality and entrepreneurship. It reminds not only the industrial heritage of this factory, but also the path of its working community, living in that which is one of the biggest, oldest and still-working European industrial neighbourhoods, almost a mini-city, where there is a lot to learn and to live. Along with this relevant intangible heritage are the &quot;Cardadores&quot;, iconic figures from Vale de Ilhavo&#x27;s traditional Carnival.

Such a lifestyle, from each one of the communities of this polycentric territory, is taken out from the gardens, streets and alleys into the cultural equipments… the “Casa da Cultura” is a second home for spectators and artists, a place to welcome the world, the “Fábrica das Ideias”, just as the industrial city where it is settled – Gafanha da Nazaré – produces and exports art, by being at the service of artistic creation. The “Laboratório das Artes - Vista Alegre Theatre” is a space aimed at thinking, research and experiment, by welcoming the most erudite cultural events, either classical or contemporary. Finally, “Cais Criativo” is a young and effervescent space in the summer, relaxing, just as the beach where it is located – Costa Nova, and introspective and inspiring during the winter.

Sailing, surfing, kitesurfing, canoeing or diving, apart from major water sports and other sport varieties, are the motivational poster of the estuary and the sea, natural amphitheatres for water sports, at a Municipality where bikes, hiking or sport practice at the various public fields, are part of leisure activities, which also includes relaxing at the charismatic beaches of Barra and Costa Nova.

<doc id="1171869" wikidata="Q1053892" url="?curid=1171869" title="Central London Railway">
<text>The Central London Railway (CLR), also known as the Twopenny Tube, was a deep-level, underground &quot;tube&quot; railway that opened in London in 1900. The CLR&#x27;s tunnels and stations form the central section of what became London Underground&#x27;s Central line.

The railway company was established in 1889, funding for construction was obtained in 1895 through a syndicate of financiers and work took place from 1896 to 1900. When opened, the CLR served 13 stations and ran completely underground in a pair of tunnels for between its western terminus at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and its eastern terminus at the Bank of England, with a depot and power station to the north of the western terminus. After a rejected proposal to turn the line into a loop, it was extended at the western end to Wood Lane in 1908 and at the eastern end to Liverpool Street station in 1912. In 1920, it was extended along a Great Western Railway line to Ealing to serve a total distance of .

After initially making good returns for investors, the CLR suffered a decline in passenger numbers due to increased competition from other underground railway lines and new motorised buses. In 1913, it was taken over by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), operator of the majority of London&#x27;s underground railways. In 1933 the CLR was taken into public ownership along with the UERL.

==Establishment==

===Origin, 1889–1892===

In November 1889, the CLR published a notice of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill proposed an underground electric railway running from the junction of Queen&#x27;s Road (now Queensway) and Bayswater Road in Bayswater to King William Street in the City of London with a connection to the then-under construction, City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) at Arthur Street West. The CLR was to run in a pair of tunnels under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, Cheapside, and Poultry. Stations were planned at Queen&#x27;s Road, Stanhope Terrace, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Southampton Row, Holborn Circus, St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand and King William Street.

The tunnels were to be in diameter, constructed with a tunnelling shield, and would be lined with cast iron segments. At stations, the tunnel diameter would be or depending on layout. A depot and power station were to be constructed on a site on the west side of Queen&#x27;s Road. Hydraulic lifts from the street to the platforms were to be provided at each station.

The proposals faced strong objections from the Metropolitan and District railways (MR and DR) whose routes on the Inner Circle, to the north and the south respectively, the CLR route paralleled; and from which the new line was expected to take passengers. The City Corporation also objected, concerned about potential damage to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during the construction of the C&amp;SLR. The Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral objected, concerned about the risks of undermining the cathedral&#x27;s foundations. Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city&#x27;s sewer system. The bill was approved by the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords, which recommended that any decision be postponed until after the C&amp;SLR had opened and its operation could be assessed.

In November 1890, with the C&amp;SLR about to start operating, the CLR announced a new bill for the 1891 parliamentary session. The route was extended at the western end to run under Notting Hill High Street (now Notting Hill Gate) and Holland Park Avenue to end at the eastern corner of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, with the depot and power station site relocated to be north of the terminus on the east side of Wood Lane. The westward extension of the route was inspired by the route of abandoned plans for the London Central Subway, a sub-surface railway that was briefly proposed in early 1890 to run directly below the roadway on a similar route to the CLR. The eastern terminus was changed to Cornhill and the proposed Southampton Row station was replaced by one in Bloomsbury. Intermediate stations were added at Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill Gate, Davies Street (which the CLR planned to extend northwards to meet Oxford Street) and at Chancery Lane. The earlier plan to connect to the C&amp;SLR was dropped and the diameter of the CLR&#x27;s tunnels was increased to . This time the bill was approved by both Houses of Parliament and received royal assent on 1891 as the &#x27; (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. cxcvi). In November 1891, the CLR publicised another bill. The eastern end of the line was re-routed north-east and extended to end under the Great Eastern Railway&#x27;s (GER&#x27;s) terminus at Liverpool Street station with the Cornhill terminus dropped and a new station proposed at the Royal Exchange. The proposals received assent as the &#x27; (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. ccxli) on 1892.


The money to build the CLR was obtained through a syndicate of financiers including Ernest Cassel, Henry Oppenheim, Darius Ogden Mills, and members of the Rothschild family. On 1894, the syndicate incorporated a contractor to construct the railway, the Electric Traction Company Limited (ETCL), which agreed a construction cost of £2,544,000 (approximately £ today) plus £700,000 in 4 per cent debenture stock. When the syndicate offered 285,000 CLR company shares for sale at £10 each in June 1895, only 14 per cent was bought by the British public, which was cautious of such investments following failures of similar railway schemes. Some shares were sold in Europe and the United States, but the unsold remainder was bought by members of the syndicate or by the ETCL.

===Construction, 1896–1900===
To design the railway, the CLR employed the engineers James Henry Greathead, Sir John Fowler, and Sir Benjamin Baker. Greathead had been the engineer for the Tower Subway and the C&amp;SLR, and had developed the tunnelling shield used to excavate those companies&#x27; tunnels under the River Thames. Fowler had been the engineer on the Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground railway opened in 1863, and Baker had worked on New York&#x27;s elevated railways and on the Forth Railway Bridge with Fowler. Greathead died shortly after work began and was replaced by Basil Mott, his assistant during the construction of the C&amp;SLR. Horace Field Parshall was the consulting engineer and designer for the electrification system, including the generating plant and locomotives.


Like most legislation of its kind, the Central London Railway Act 1891 imposed a time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction was the end of 1896, but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. lvii). Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin&#x27;s Le Grand and St Martin&#x27;s Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.

Negotiations with the GER for the works under Liverpool Street station were unsuccessful, and the final section beyond Bank was only constructed for a short distance as sidings. To minimise the risk of subsidence, the routing of the tunnels followed the roads on the surface and avoided passing under buildings. Usually the tunnels were bored side by side below the surface, but where a road was too narrow to allow this, the tunnels were aligned one above the other, so that a number of stations have platforms at different levels. To assist with the deceleration of trains arriving at stations and the acceleration of trains leaving, station tunnels were located at the tops of slight inclines.
Tunnelling was completed by the end of 1898, and, because a planned concrete lining to the cast iron tunnel rings was not installed, the internal diameter of the tunnels was generally . For Bank station, the CLR negotiated permission with the City Corporation to construct its ticket hall beneath a steel framework under the roadway and pavements at the junction of Threadneedle Street and Cornhill. This involved diverting pipework and cables into ducts beneath the subways linking the ticket hall to the street. Delays on this work were so costly that they nearly bankrupted the company. A further extension of time to 1900 was obtained through the (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. clxxxv).

Apart from Bank, which was completely below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures to allow for future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided in a variety of sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.
==Opening==

The official opening of the CLR by the Prince of Wales took place on 1900, one day before the time limit of the 1899 Act, although the line did not open to the public until 1900. The railway had stations at:
* Shepherd&#x27;s Bush
* Holland Park
* Notting Hill Gate
* Queen&#x27;s Road (now Queensway)
* Lancaster Gate
* Marble Arch
* Bond Street (opened 1900)
* Oxford Circus
* Tottenham Court Road
* British Museum (closed 1933)
* Chancery Lane
* Post Office (now St. Paul&#x27;s)
* Bank

The CLR charged a flat fare of two pence for a journey between any two stations, leading the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to give the railway the nickname of the &quot;Twopenny Tube&quot; in August 1900. The service was very popular, and, by the end of 1900, the railway had carried 14,916,922 passengers. By attracting passengers from the bus services along its route and from the slower, steam-hauled, MR and DR services, the CLR achieved passenger numbers around per year in the first few years of operation, generating a high turnover that was more than twice the expenses. From 1900 to 1905, the company paid a dividend of 4 per cent to investors.

==Rolling stock==
Greathead had originally planned for the trains to be hauled by a pair of small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at each end of the carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR had originally intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.

Soon after the railway opened, complaints about vibrations from passing trains began to be made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44 tons (44.7 tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31 tons (31.5 tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver&#x27;s cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee&#x27;s report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR&#x27;s choice of 100 lb/yard (49.60 kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration.

Following the report, the CLR purchased 64 driving motor carriages for use with the existing stock; together, these were formed into six- or seven-carriage trains. The change to multiple unit operation was completed by June 1903 and all but two of the locomotives were scrapped. Those two were retained for shunting use in the depot.

==Extensions==

===Reversing loops, 1901===
The CLR&#x27;s ability to manage its high passenger numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was directly related to the time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½ minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops at each end of the line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.

The CLR bill was one of more than a dozen tube railway bills submitted to Parliament for the 1901 session, To review the bills on an equal basis, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor, but by the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Among the committee&#x27;s recommendations were the withdrawal of the CLR&#x27;s City loop, and that a quick, tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London&#x27;s commuters.
===Loop line, 1902–1905===

Rather than resubmit its 1901 bill, the CLR presented a much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The reversing loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points, adopting the committee&#x27;s recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the dead-end reversing siding west of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south. At the southern end of Hammersmith Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road (now Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Road) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there.

From Hammersmith, the CLR&#x27;s route was to turn eastwards and run under Hammersmith Road and Kensington High Street with interchange stations at the DR&#x27;s Addison Road (now Kensington Olympia) and High Street Kensington stations. From Kensington High Street, the route was to run along the south side of Kensington Gardens beneath Kensington Road, Kensington Gore and Knightsbridge. Stations were to be constructed at the Royal Albert Hall and the junction of Knightsbridge and Sloane Street, where the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR) already had permission to build a station. From Sloane Street, the CLR&#x27;s proposed route ran below that approved for the B&amp;PCR under the eastern portion of Knightsbridge, under Hyde Park Corner and along Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus. At Hyde Park Corner, a CLR station was to be sited close to the B&amp;PCR&#x27;s station and the CLR&#x27;s next station at St James&#x27;s Street was a short distance to the east of the B&amp;PCR&#x27;s planned Dover Street station. At Piccadilly Circus, the CLR planned an interchange with the partially completed station of the stalled Baker Street and Waterloo Railway. The CLR route was then to turn south-east beneath Leicester Square to a station at Charing Cross and then north-east under Strand to Norfolk Street to interchange with the planned terminus of the Great Northern &amp; Strand Railway.

The route was then to continue east under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus for an interchange with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway&#x27;s (SECR&#x27;s) Ludgate Hill station, then south under New Bridge Street, and east into Queen Victoria Street where a station was planned to connect to the District Railway&#x27;s Mansion House station. The route was then to continue under Queen Victoria Street to reach the CLR&#x27;s station at Bank, where separate platforms below the existing ones were to be provided. The final section of the route developed on the proposed loop from the year before with tunnels winding under the city&#x27;s narrow, twisting streets. The tunnels were to run east, one below the other, beneath Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, north under St Mary Axe and west to Liverpool Street station, then south under Blomfield Street, east under Great Winchester Street, south under Austin Friars and Old Broad Street and west under Threadneedle Street where the tunnels were to connect with the existing sidings back into Bank. Two stations were to be provided on the loop; at the south end of St Mary Axe and at Liverpool Street station. To accommodate the additional rolling stock needed to operate the longer line, the depot was to be extended northwards. The power station was also to be enlarged to increase the electricity supply. The CLR estimated that its plan would cost £3,781,000 (approximately £ today): £2,110,000 for construction, £873,000 for land and £798,000 for electrical equipment and trains.
The CLR bill was one of many presented for the 1902 parliamentary session (including several for the Hammersmith to City route) and it was examined by another joint committee under Lord Windsor. The proposal received support from the mainline railway companies the route interchanged with and from the C&amp;SLR, which had a station at Bank. The London County Council and the City Corporation also supported the plan. The Metropolitan Railway opposed, seeing further competition to its services on the Inner Circle. Questions were raised in Parliament about the safety of tunnelling so close to the vaults of many City banks and the risk that subsidence might cause vault doors to jam shut. Another concern was the danger of undermining the foundations of the Dutch Church in Austin Friars. The Windsor committee rejected the section between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Bank, preferring a competing route from the J. P. Morgan-backed Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway (PC&amp;NELR). Without the main part of its new route, the CLR withdrew the City loop, leaving a few improvements to the existing line to be approved in the (2 Edw. 7. c. cxlv) on 1902.

In late 1902, the PC&amp;NELR plans collapsed after a falling out between the scheme&#x27;s promoters led to a crucial part of the planned route coming under the control of a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC&amp;NELR scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament&#x27;s establishment of the Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.

===Wood Lane, 1906–1908===


In 1905, the government announced plans to hold an international exhibition to celebrate the Entente cordiale signed by France and Britain in 1904. The location of the Franco-British Exhibition&#x27;s White City site was across Wood Lane from the CLR&#x27;s depot. To exploit the opportunity to carry visitors to the exhibition, the CLR announced a bill in November 1906 seeking to create a loop from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station and back, on which a new Wood Lane station close to the exhibition&#x27;s entrance would be built. The new work was approved on 1907 in the .

The new loop was formed by constructing a section of tunnel joining the end of the dead-end reversing tunnel to the west of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station and the north side of the depot. From Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, trains ran anti-clockwise around the single track loop, first through the original depot access tunnel, then passed the north side of the depot and through the new station before entering the new section of tunnel and returning to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Changes were also made to the depot layout to accommodate the new station and the new looped operations. Construction work on the exhibition site had started in January 1907, and the exhibition and new station opened on 1908. The station was on the surface between the two tunnel openings and was a basic design by Harry Bell Measures. It had platforms both sides of the curving track – passengers alighted on to one and boarded from the other (an arrangement now known as the Spanish solution).
===Liverpool Street, 1908–1912===

With the extension to Wood Lane operational, the CLR revisited its earlier plan for an eastward extension from Bank to Liverpool Street station. This time, the Great Eastern Railway (GER) agreed to allow the CLR to build a station under its own main line terminus, provided that no further extension would be made north or north-east from there – territory served by the GER&#x27;s routes from Liverpool Street. A bill was announced in November 1908, for the 1909 parliamentary session and received royal assent as the (9 Edw. 7. c. lxxi) on 1909. Construction started in July 1910 and the new Liverpool Street station was opened on 1912. Following their successful introduction at the DR&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court station in 1911, the station was the first underground station in London to be built with escalators. Four were provided, two to Liverpool Street station and two to the North London Railway&#x27;s adjacent Broad Street station.

===Ealing Broadway, 1911–1920===
The CLR&#x27;s next planned extension was westward to Ealing. In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) had obtained parliamentary approval to construct the Ealing and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Railway (E&amp;SBR), connecting its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. From Ealing, the new line was to curve north-east through still mostly rural North Acton, then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR&#x27;s High Wycombe line, before curving south-east. The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak Common and Wormwood Scrubs before connecting to the WLR a short distance to the north of the CLR&#x27;s depot.


Construction work did not begin immediately, and, in 1911, the CLR and GWR agreed running powers for CLR services over the line to Ealing Broadway. To make a connection to the E&amp;SBR, the CLR obtained parliamentary permission for a short extension northward from Wood Lane station on 1911 in the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. lxxxiii). The new E&amp;SBR line was constructed by the GWR and opened as a steam-hauled freight only line on 1917. Electrification of the track and the start of CLR services were postponed until after the end of World War I, not starting until 1920 when a single intermediate station at East Acton was also opened.

Wood Lane station was modified and extended to accommodate the northward extension tracks linking to the E&amp;SBR. The existing platforms on the loop were retained, continuing to be used by trains that were turning back to central London, and two new platforms for trains running to or from Ealing were constructed at a lower level on the new tracks, which connected to each side of the loop. Ealing Broadway station was modified to provide additional platforms for CLR use between the existing but separate sets of platforms used by the GWR and the DR.

To provide services over the extension, the CLR ordered 24 additional driving motor carriages from the Brush Company, which, when delivered in 1917, were first borrowed by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway for use in place of carriages ordered for its extension to Watford Junction. The new carriages were the first for tube-sized trains that were fully enclosed, without gated platforms at the rear, and were provided with hinged doors in the sides to speed-up passenger loading times. To operate with the new stock the CLR converted 48 existing carriages, providing a total of 72 carriages for twelve six-car trains. Modifications made while in use on the Watford extension meant that the new carriages were not compatible with the rest of the CLR&#x27;s fleet and they became known as the &quot;Ealing stock&quot;.

The E&amp;SBR remained part of the GWR until nationalisation at the beginning of 1948, when (with the exception of Ealing Broadway station) it was transferred to the London Transport Executive. Ealing Broadway remained part of British Railways, as successors to the GWR.

===Richmond, 1913 and 1920===

In November 1912, the CLR announced plans for an extension from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush on a new south-westwards route. Tunnels were planned under Goldhawk Road, Stamford Brook Road and Bath Road to Chiswick Common where a turn to the south would take the tunnels under Turnham Green Terrace for a short distance. The route then was to head west again to continue under Chiswick High Road before coming to the surface east of the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s (L&amp;SWR&#x27;s) Gunnersbury station. Here a connection would be made to allow the CLR&#x27;s tube trains to run south-west to Richmond station over L&amp;SWR tracks that the DR shared and had electrified in 1905. Stations were planned on Goldhawk Road at its junctions with The Grove, Paddenswick Road and Rylett Road, at Emlyn Road on Stamford Brook Road, at Turnham Green Terrace (for a connection with the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s/DR&#x27;s Turnham Green station) and at the junction of Chiswick High Road and Heathfield Terrace. Beyond Richmond, the CLR saw further opportunities to continue over L&amp;SWR tracks to the commuter towns of Twickenham, Sunbury and Shepperton, although this required the tracks to be electrified. The CLR received permission for the new line to Gunnersbury on 1913 in the (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. lxxiii), but World War I prevented the works from commencing and the permission expired.

 In November 1919, the CLR published a new bill to revive the Richmond extension, but using a different route that required only a short section of new tunnel construction. The new proposal was to construct tunnels southwards from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station, which would come to the surface to connect to disused L&amp;SWR tracks north of Hammersmith Grove Road station that had closed in 1916. From Hammersmith, the disused LS&amp;WR tracks continued westwards, on the same viaduct as the DR&#x27;s tracks through Turnham Green to Gunnersbury and Richmond. The plan required electrification of the disused tracks, but avoided the need for costly tunnelling and would have shared the existing stations on the route with the DR. The plan received assent on 1920 as part of the Central London and Metropolitan District Railways Companies (Works) Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. lxxxii), although the CLR made no attempt to carry out any of the work. The disused L&amp;SWR tracks between Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green were eventually used for the westward extension of the Piccadilly line from Hammersmith in 1932.

==Competition, co-operation and sale, 1906–1913==
From 1906 the CLR began to experience a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.

The CLR looked to economise through the use of technological developments. The introduction in 1909 of dead-man&#x27;s handles to the driver controls and &quot;trip cocks&quot; devices on signals and trains meant that the assistant driver was no longer required as a safety measure. Signalling automation allowed the closure of many of the line&#x27;s 16 signal boxes and a reduction in signalling staff. From 1911, the CLR operated a parcel service, making modifications to the driving cars of four trains to provide a compartment in which parcels could be sorted. These were collected at each station and distributed to their destinations by a team of tricycle riding delivery boys. The service made a small profit, but ended in 1917 because of wartime labour shortages.

The problem of declining revenues was not limited to the CLR; all of London&#x27;s tube lines and the sub-surface DR and MR were affected by competition to some degree. The reduced income from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the companies to pay back borrowed capital, or to pay dividends to shareholders. The CLR&#x27;s dividend payments fell to 3 per cent from 1905, but those of the UERL&#x27;s lines were as low as 0.75 per cent. From 1907, the CLR, the UERL, the C&amp;SLR, and the Great Northern &amp; City Railway companies began to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the &quot;Underground&quot;. In November 1912, after secret take-over talks, the UERL announced that it was purchasing the CLR, swapping one of its own shares for each of the CLR&#x27;s. The take-over took effect on 1913, although the CLR company remained legally separate from the UERL&#x27;s other tube lines.

==Improvements and integration, 1920–1933==

Following the takeover, the UERL took steps to integrate the CLR&#x27;s operations with its own. The CLR&#x27;s power station was closed in March 1928 with power instead being supplied from the UERL&#x27;s Lots Road Power Station in Chelsea. Busier stations were modernised; Bank and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush stations received escalators in 1924, Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus in 1925 and Bond Street in 1926, which also received a new entrance designed by Charles Holden. Chancery Lane and Marble Arch stations were also rebuilt to receive escalators in the early 1930s.

On 5 November 1923 new stations were opened on the Ealing extension at North Acton and West Acton. They were built to serve residential and industrial developments around Park Royal and, like East Acton, the station buildings were basic structures with simple timber shelters on the platforms. The poor location of British Museum station and the lack of an interchange with the GNP&amp;BR&#x27;s station at Holborn had been a considered a problem by the CLR almost since the opening of the GNP&amp;BR in 1906. A pedestrian subway to link the stations was considered in 1907, but not carried out. A proposal to enlarge the tunnels under High Holborn to create new platforms at Holborn station for the CLR and to abandon British Museum station was included in a CLR bill submitted to parliament in November 1913. This was given assent in 1914, but World War I prevented any works taking place, and it was not until 1930 that the UERL revived the powers and began construction work. The new platforms, along with a new ticket hall and escalators to both lines, opened on 1933, British Museum station having closed at the end of traffic the day before.

Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR converted the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end car platforms were enclosed to provide additional passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserted on each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where the length of the platform on the inside of the returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.

==Move to public ownership, 1923–1933==
Despite closer co-operation and improvements made to the CLR stations and to other parts of the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL&#x27;s ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.

To protect the UERL group&#x27;s income, its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC&#x27;s tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the MR and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1933. On this date, ownership of the assets of the CLR and the other Underground companies transferred to the LPTB.

==Legacy==

In 1935 the LPTB announced plans as part of its New Works Programme to extend the CLR at both ends by taking over and electrifying local routes owned by the GWR in Middlesex and Buckinghamshire and by the LNER in east London and Essex. Work in the tunnels to lengthen platforms for longer trains and to correct misaligned tunnel sections that slowed running speeds was also carried out. A new station was planned to replace the cramped Wood Lane. The service from North Acton through Greenford and Ruislip to Denham was due to open between January 1940 and March 1941. The eastern extension from Liverpool Street to Stratford, Leyton and Newbury Park and the connection to the LNER lines to Hainault, Epping and Ongar were intended to open in 1940 and 1941. World War II caused works on both extensions to be halted and London Underground services were extended in stages from 1946 to 1949, although the final section from West Ruislip to Denham was cancelled. Following the LPTB takeover, the Harry Beck-designed tube map began to show the route&#x27;s name as the &quot;Central London Line&quot; instead of &quot;Central London Railway&quot;. In anticipation of the extensions taking its services far beyond the boundaries of the County of London, &quot;London&quot; was omitted from the name on 1937; thereafter it was simply the &quot;Central line&quot;. The CLR&#x27;s original tunnels form the core of the Central line&#x27;s route.

During World War II, of completed tube tunnels built for the eastern extension between Gants Hill and Redbridge were used as a factory by Plessey to manufacture electronic parts for aircraft. Other completed tunnels were used as air-raid shelters at Liverpool Street, Bethnal Green and between Stratford and Leyton, as were the closed parts of British Museum station At Chancery Lane, new tunnels in diameter and long were constructed below the running tunnels during 1941 and early 1942. These were fitted out as a deep level shelter for government use as a protected communications centre. Work on a similar shelter was planned at Post Office station (renamed St Paul&#x27;s in 1937) but was cancelled; the lift shafts that were made redundant when the station was given escalators in January 1939 were converted for use as a protected control centre for the Central Electricity Board.

<text>The Hanjin Group () is a South Korean chaebol. The group has various industries covered from transportation and airlines to hotels, tourism, and airport businesses, and one of the largest chaebols in Korea. The group includes Korean Air (KAL), which was acquired by the founder Cho Choong-hoon in 1969, and was the owner of Hanjin Shipping (once the largest shipping company in Korea) before its bankruptcy. In 2013, Hanjin Group officially switched from cross ownership to a holding company structure with the establishment of Hanjin KAL Corporation. The group is controlled by descendants of Cho Choong-hoon, and many construction chaebols are the major shareholders of Hanjin KAL.

==History==

Hanjin started at the end of World War II, in November 1945. Early on, its biggest customer was the U.S. Army, providing the transportation of material to both Korea and Vietnam. The company signed a major contract with the US 8th Army in November 1956, and another contract in March 1966, with all of the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. In November 1969, Hanjin made its entry into the containerized shipping business signing a deal with Sea-Land Service, Inc. In September 1970, the company opened its first container yard at the port of Busan.

The late 1970s saw a major push into the Middle East with contracts signed to Kuwait at the port of Shuwaik (September 1977), Saudi Arabia at the port of Dammam (March 1979), and at the port of Jeddah (May 1980).

In March 1990, Hanjin branched out into trucking and warehousing with the purchase of Korea Freight Transport Company. In June 1992, Hanjin Express was introduced to deliver small packages and provide courier service. The company started to load and unload cargo at the ports of Long Beach and Seattle with the joint venture Total Terminals International LLC., in August 1992. In January 1993, they initiated container rail service between Busan and Uiwang. In May 1995, Hanjin hauled grain to North Korea. The Hanjin-Senator once was the seventh largest container transportation and shipping company in the world (operations ceased February 2009).

After Hanjin&#x27;s founder, Cho Choong-hoon, died in 2002, his eldest son, Cho Yang-ho, inherited KAL, when his third son, Cho Soo-ho, was handed Hanjin Shipping. Cho Soo-ho died from lung cancer in 2006 and his widow, Choi Eun-young, became the chairwoman of Hanjin Shipping in the following year. KAL acquired 33.2 percent of Hanjin Shipping in June 2014.

On 31 August 2016, Hanjin Shipping filed for bankruptcy. Hanjin Shipping&#x27;s creditors withdrew their support after deeming a funding plan by parent company Hanjin inadequate.

<doc id="1171883" wikidata="Q293048" url="?curid=1171883" title="Ólavsøka">
<text>Ólavsøka () is the biggest summer festival in the Faroe Islands, and by most Faroese considered as the national holiday of the Faroes along with Flag Day on 25 April. Ólavsøka is celebrated over two days, from the 28th to the 29th of July, the second of which is the day when the Faroese Parliament (&quot;Løgting&quot;) opens its session.

Ólavsøka is a cultural and sports festival with boat races, football matches and other events. The 28 July, which is the day where the finals of the rowing competitions take place, is half working day for the members of some of the labour unions while Saint Olaf&#x27;s Day (&quot;Ólavsøkudagur&quot;) on 29 July is full holiday for members of most of the unions.

The literal meaning is &quot;Olaf&#x27;s vigil&quot; (&quot;vigilia sancti Olavi&quot; in Latin), from Saint Olaf&#x27;s death at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 (see Olsok).
Vøka comes from Old Norse Vaka, which was a religious celebration that always lasted for two days. Like several other Faroese holidays, the &quot;vøka&quot; begins the evening before, so Ólavsøka always starts on 28 July with an opening ceremony. Some events start even before that; there has been a Ólavsøka Concert held on 27 July for several years.

Ólavsøka is the day of the year when many Faroese crowd into the capital Tórshavn. There are held the national rowing competition finals, which is one of the highlights in Faroese sports. In addition, there are art exhibitions, folk music, and Faroese chain dancing. The chain dance is for everyone; normally it is held in Sjónleikarhúsið, which is a theatre in Tórshavn.

The salute for ólavsøka in Faroese is &quot;Góða ólavsøku!&quot; (Good Olaf&#x27;s Wake!).

The stamps shown on the right were issued by Postverk Føroya on 18 May 1998, and the artwork was produced by Edward Fuglø.

==Concert, 27 July==
Some of the festivities start some days before, depending on which day in the week Ólavsøka falls. There is usually also an Ólavsøka concert in Tórshavn on 27 July in the evening. In recent years, however, the concert has not been held. Instead, the one-day festival Tórsfest has been held in Tórshavn the weekend before ólavsøka.

==Procession and opening, 28 July==
Normally the opening of Ólavsøka starts with a procession of sports people from Tórshavn, city council members, a brass band and people riding on horses. They walk in procession from the public school (&quot;Kommunuskúlin&quot;) down to the centre of town to Tinghúsvøllur on Vaglið, where people are waiting for the procession to arrive. The people who walk in procession then gather on the triangle-shaped Tinghúsvøllur in front of the parliament building (&quot;Løgtingshúsið og Tinghúsið&quot;), there will be a speech by someone who is appointed, and this person will officially open the Ólavsøka. A brass band normally plays at the opening.

==Boat race, 28 July==

The Ólavsøka Boat Race is always held on the eve of ólavsøka on 28 July. Before the Ólavsøka festival there have been several other village festivals around the islands, called stevnur, where the Faroese boat race has been going on, starting at the Norðoyastevna in Klaksvík, which is either in the beginning of June or in the end of May. In the end of June there is an island festival in Suðuroy which is called Jóansøka. This festival is celebrated every second year it; is held in Tvøroyri (odd years) and every second years in Vágur (even years). The rowing competition on Jóansøka is always held on a Saturday. The Faroese boat race is in several parts, divided into groups of children, boys, girls, men and women. The boat races are also grouped by the size of the boats. All the boats are wooden rowing boats, the rowing people are sitting together two and two, and one person is steering the boat in the back of the boat. In Faroese the boats are called 5-mannafør, 6-mannafør, 8-mannafør and 10-mannafør. The boats who win the ólavsøka Boat Race win a trophy and the boats who become Faroese Champions also win another trophy. Sometimes the same boat is the winner of both trophies. The rowing people who win also get medals. The distance which the boats are rowing is 1,000 meters at the ólavsøka Boat Race, except for the children who row a shorter distance. In some places the larger boats row longer distances. The 8-mannafør row 1,500 meters and the 10-mannafør row 2,000 meters. But this is not possible in Tórshavn.

==Procession and cantata, 29 July==

On 29 July the Faroese Løgting will open again after the summer holiday. The Faroese Prime Minister (&quot;Løgmaður&quot;) will give his speech, and the politicians will have the opportunity to comment on it the following days. But before the opening of the Løgting, there is a ceremony, which starts just before 11:00 in the morning, where the Faroese priests, the members of the Faroese Parliament, the head of the Police, some Danish officials and some other important people will walk in procession to Tórshavn Cathedral (&quot;Dómkirkjan&quot;, earlier called &quot;Havnar Kirkja&quot;).

After the service in the church these people will walk in procession to the House of Parliament (&quot;Tinghúsið&quot;). They will line up just outside the Tinghús facing the crowd of people who are standing around the Tinghúsvøllur. And then it is time for some classical music and choir music, the Olavsoka Cantata, which starts at 12:00 or just after. 2009 was the 100th year birthday of the Municipality of Tórshavn. One of the most famous Faroese composers Sunnleif Rasmussen composed and directed the Ólavsøka Cantata, which was based on the history of Faroese music, back to folk songs and hymns of Thomas Kingo up to the present time with modern music.

<doc id="1171896" wikidata="Q572114" url="?curid=1171896" title="Scriblerus Club">
<text>The Scriblerus Club was an informal association of authors, based in London, that came together in the early 18th century. They were prominent figures in the Augustan Age of English letters. The nucleus of the club included the satirists Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Other members were John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Henry St. John and Thomas Parnell. The group was founded in 1714 and lasted until the death of the founders, finally ending in 1745. Pope and Swift are the two members whose reputations and work have the most long-lasting influence. Working collaboratively, the group created the persona of Martinus Scriblerus, through whose writings they accomplished their satirical aims. Very little of this material, however, was published until the 1740s. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer occasionally joined the club for meetings, though he is not known to have contributed to their literary output. He, along with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the club.

The club began as an effort to satirize the abuses of learning wherever they might be found, which led to &quot;The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus&quot;. The second edition of Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; also contains work attributed to Martinus Scriblerus.

Richard Owen Cambridge wrote a mock epic poem, the &quot;Scribleriad&quot;, where the hero is Martinus Scriblerus.

Henry Fielding&#x27;s play &quot;The Welsh Opera&quot; is presented as a tribute to the &quot;Scriblerians&quot;. Fielding&#x27;s pen name was &quot;Scriblerus Secundus&quot;.

<doc id="1171898" wikidata="Q1010621" url="?curid=1171898" title="Petrovichi">
<text>Petrovichi () is a rural locality (a village) in Shumyachsky District of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located about southwest of Moscow, south of St Petersburg, south of Smolensk, and east of the border between Belarus and Russia. Its population in 1998 was 215.

The village is the birthplace of Isaac Asimov. Asimov left it at the age of three, with his parents and sister, emigrating to the United States. There is a stone memorial at the site of his birth.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of Petrovichi is from 1403. In the Russian Empire, Petrovichi was a &quot;shtetl&quot; in Klimovichskiy Uyezd (an &quot;uyezd&quot; with the seat in Klimovichi) of Mogilev Governorate. The governorate, historically Belarusian land, was a part of the Empire&#x27;s Northwestern Krai. Petrovichi&#x27;s population was half Jewish, half Belarusian. It had both a church and a synagogue, each one with a school attached to it. According to Asimov&#x27;s memoirs, the place had never known of pogroms. There were amicable business connections and even friendships between the two communities. Asimov even reports non-Jews paying friendly visits to the local synagogue.

Tsar Nicholas I (who ruled from 1825 to 1855) at one point ordered the expulsion of all Jewish people who resided in Great Russia, or Russia proper, outside of the Pale of Settlement. However, a rich and powerful Russian landlord, who owned much land on both sides of the border, saved the Jewish community of Petrovichi from &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; by illegally moving the border marker from the west to the east of the &quot;shtetl&quot;. Thus he saved half of the people from much suffering, as well as saving himself from losing their talents and skills. Petrovichi was an important hub of the wheat trade, and Jewish traders in wheat were respected for their honesty and efficiency. Petrovichi was part of Belarus for several decades.

During the Soviet times, restrictions were no longer imposed on the settlement of Jewish people. The village became a part of the Russian SFSR and briefly belonged to Gomel Governorate before being transferred to Smolensk Oblast. The population dwindled significantly.

In 1921, Isaac Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi developed double pneumonia. Only Asimov survived.

In July 1941, Petrovichi was occupied by the German armies. 416 Jewish inhabitants who did not flee in time were massacred. It was liberated by the Red Army in September 1943.

Erland Andersson of Sweden (trials-rider and custom-bike builder under the label &quot;EAS&quot;) invented the crosskart in the early 1980s. The idea was to create something that is safe, cheap, and easy to maintain, but still fun to ride. The crosskart is basically a simplified version of a sprint car, midget car and mini sprint.

Crosskarting is probably most popular in the Nordic countries, although in southern Europe a similar motorsport with more powerful engines, &quot;kartcross&quot;, exists.

<doc id="1171923" wikidata="Q548319" url="?curid=1171923" title="Kouign-amann">
<text>Kouign-amann (; ; ) is a sweet, round Breton laminated dough pastry, originally made with bread dough (nowadays sometimes viennoiserie dough), containing layers of butter and incorporated sugar, similar in fashion to puff pastry albeit with fewer layers. It is slowly baked until the sugar caramelizes and the butter (in fact the steam from the water in the butter) expands the dough, resulting in its layered structure. A smaller version, kouignette, is similar to a muffin-shaped, caramelized croissant.

A specialty of the town of Douarnenez in Finistère, Brittany where it originated around 1860, the pastry is attributed to Yves-René Scordia (1828–1878). The name comes from the Breton language words for &#x27;bread&#x27; (&quot;&quot;) and &#x27;butter&#x27; (&quot;&quot;), and in 2011 the &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the fattiest pastry in all of Europe.&quot;

== Recipe ==
The strict original Douarnenez recipe requires a ratio of 40 percent bread dough, 30 percent butter, and 30 percent sugar. Traditionally, kouign-amann is baked as a large cake and served in slices, although recently, especially in North America, individual cupcake-sized pastries (kouignettes) have become more popular.

== Popularity ==
Kouign-amann has been a staple pastry at many Japanese bakeries after becoming popular in the late 1990s.

In 2014 episode 7 of series 5 of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; featured kouign-amann. In 2015, notable bakeries in New York City, Washington D.C., Boston, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco began to sell the pastry. In Denver, several bakeries offer varieties; some shorten the name to &quot;queen&quot;.

As of 2024, kouign-amann had also gained popularity in countries worldwide such as Indonesia thanks to coffeeshop chains that operated in the country such as Maison Kayser and Starbucks.

<text>Dame Mary Douglas, (25 March 1921 – 16 May 2007) was a British anthropologist, known for her writings on human culture, symbolism and risk, whose area of speciality was social anthropology. Douglas was considered a follower of Émile Durkheim and a proponent of structuralist analysis, with a strong interest in comparative religion.

==Biography==
She was born as Margaret Mary Tew in Sanremo, Italy, to Gilbert and Phyllis (née Twomey) Tew. Her father, Gilbert Tew, was a member of the Indian Civil Service serving in Burma, as was her maternal grandfather, Sir Daniel Twomey, who retired as the Chief Judge of the Chief Court of Lower Burma. Her mother was a devout Roman Catholic, and Mary and her younger sister, Patricia, were raised in that faith. After their mother&#x27;s death, the sisters were raised by their maternal grandparents and attended the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Convent in Roehampton. Mary went on to study at St. Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1939 to 1943; there she was influenced by E. E. Evans-Pritchard. She graduated with a second-class degree.

She worked in the British Colonial Office, where she encountered many social anthropologists. In 1946, Douglas returned to Oxford to take a &quot;conversion&quot; course in anthropology and registered for the doctorate in anthropology in 1949. She studied with M. N. Srinivas as well as E. E. Evans-Pritchard. In 1949 she did field work with the Lele people in what was then the Belgian Congo; this took her to village life in the region between the Kasai River and the Loange River, where the Lele lived on the edge of what had previously been the Kuba Kingdom. Ultimately, a civil war prevented her from continuing her fieldwork, but nevertheless, this led to Douglas&#x27; first publication, &quot;The Lele of the Kasai&quot;, published in 1963.

In the early 1950s, she completed her doctorate and married James Douglas. Like her, he was a Catholic and had been born into a colonial family (in Simla, while his father served in the Indian army). They had three children. She taught at University College London, where she remained for around 25 years, becoming Professor of Social Anthropology.

Her reputation was established by her most celebrated book, &quot;Purity and Danger&quot; (1966).

She wrote &quot;The World of Goods&quot; (1978) with an econometrist, Baron Isherwood, which was considered a pioneering work on economic anthropology. She co-authored with Aaron Wildavsky a book on risk and danger. They used the cultural theory of risk to explore how and why social groups disregard some dangers but identify others as risks that require mitigating action.

She taught and wrote in the United States for 11 years. She published on such subjects as risk analysis and the environment, consumption and welfare economics, and food and ritual, all increasingly cited outside anthropology circles. After four years (1977–81) as Foundation Research Professor of Cultural Studies at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York, she moved to Northwestern University as Avalon Professor of the Humanities with a remit to link the studies of theology and anthropology, and spent three years at Princeton University. She received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden in 1986. In 1988 she returned to Britain, where she gave the Gifford Lectures in 1989.

In 1989 she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. She became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992, and was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the Queen&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Honours List published on 30 December 2006. She died on 16 May 2007 in London, aged 86, from complications of cancer, survived by her three children. Her husband died in 2004.

In 2002 a twelve volume edition of her &quot;Collected work&quot; was published by Routledge.

==Contributions to anthropology==

=== &quot;Fieldwork and Ethnography: The Lele of the Kasai&quot; ===

When Mary Douglas started her fieldwork in the late 1940s in the Belgian Congo, British social anthropology was a small elite discipline dominated by men who, as Edmund Leach caustically commented, saw themselves as gentlemen scholars. Entry to this elite club involved undertaking intense ethnographic fieldwork following the model developed by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Island. Edmund Leach described this approach to anthropology as ‘butterfly collecting’, it was a way of recording ‘Other Cultures’ before they were overwhelmed by European political, religious and cultural institutions. Underpinning this approach was a paradox, social anthropologists worked alongside colonial officials, indeed their safety could depend on the intervention of such officials yet, in their accounts of these other cultures, such colonial interventions were conspicuous by their absence. For example in his ethnography of the Nuer in Southern Sudan, Evans-Pritchard omits to mention that the Nuer were in conflict with the British Colonial authorities in Khartoum who sent planes to intimidate them and even bomb their cattle.

For the most part, Mary Douglas’s ethnography of the Lele hand cultivators who lived in the forests of South Western Belgian Congo, follows the conventional pattern of contemporary ethnographies. Working in the structural function tradition in which the anthropologist seeks to identify the key structures and institutions and examines how they work to maintain society, Douglas explored how the Lele maintained social stability when there was no apparent authority, no leaders with legitimate power. Douglas described a society in which older men collectively controlled key resources, women, cult membership and knowledge of divination and sorcery. Younger men were dependent on these older men but in time took their places. The tensions between these groups were kept under control by potential and actual accusations of sorcery. Older men were careful not cause offence and avoid accusations of sorcery and younger men could use sorcery accusations to blame their older relatives for their misfortunes. 

Douglas’s ethnography differed from conventional ethnographies. In particular it was written in the past tense. Conventionally ethnographies were written in the present tense; an attempt to record and preserve a reality that was destined to disappear. Douglas explicitly acknowledged and examined the ways in which colonial authorities were changing the Lele. For example she noted that Belgian colonial authorities had outlawed the poison ordeal. This was an important mechanism that limited the number of sorcery accusations as both the accuser and accused had to take the poison and one was expected to die; either the guilty sorcerer or the false accuser.

When Douglas returned to Kasai in the 1987 she found major changes in social and religious relationships. Many younger Lele had taken advantage of European education and had migrated to the capital, Kinshasa where they thrived as professionals, entrepreneurs or catholic priests. Those older people who remained in the villages and retained allegiances to traditional beliefs, were by the 1980s experiencing economic hardship. Younger urban Lele were adopting Christianity. This changed the nature of sorcery accusations which were increasingly used as a way for young Lele priests to attack and destroy traditional religion through the purging of older sorcerers and their sinful practices. There were public purges of sorcerers and ‘Those who were suspected of sorcery were beaten and burned until they confessed’.

=== &quot;Purity and Danger&quot; (1966) ===
Douglas&#x27; book &quot;Purity and Danger&quot; (first published 1966) is an analysis of the concepts of ritual purity and pollution in different societies and times to construct a general concept on how ritual purity is established, and is considered a key text in social anthropology. The text is renowned for its passionate defense of both ritual and purity during a time when conceptions of defilement were treated with disdain. &quot;Purity and Danger&quot; is most notable for demonstrating the comparative nature of her reflexions. In contrast to Claude Lévi-Strauss, who takes a structuralist approach, Douglas seeks to demonstrate how peoples&#x27; classifications play a role in determining what is considered abnormal and their treatment of it. Douglas insists on the importance of understanding the concept of pollution and ritual purity by comparing our own understandings and rituals to &quot;primitive&quot; rituals.

==== Purity in European and &quot;primitive&quot; societies ====
Douglas states that &quot;primitive&quot; societies are classified as those that do not recognize a distinction between being pure and being unclean. For western societies, there exists a clear distinction between what is dirty and what is considered holy. Therefore,For primitive societies, the ideas of taboo and holiness are personified by the notions of friendly or unfriendly deities; there exists a separation because objects, people, or places are associated with either good or bad deities. For this uncleanness to be transmitted, material contact must occur; being in physical contact with an object considered as unclean allows for the transmission of uncleanness to the body. A distinction to be made with Christianity, for example, would be that the uncleanness would pass not onto the body itself, but the spirit. Douglas emphasizes that in order to fully comprehend other societies understanding of taboo and sacred, one must first understand one&#x27;s own.

==== The notion of &quot;dirt&quot; ====
Douglas dismantles a common euro-centric misconception that rituals and rites for cleanliness were devised with hygiene or sanitation as its goals. The avoidance of pork in Islam is often considered as having a hygienic basis, or that incense was used to mask body odors rather than symbolizing the ascending smoke of sacrifice. For Douglas, there exists a clear distinction between recognizing the side-benefits of ritual actions and considering them as a whole and sufficient explanation for ritual actions. Furthermore, Douglas recognized that there exists a strong resemblance between European rituals and primitive rituals in principle, omitting the differing foundations that separate European rituals based on hygiene and primitive ones on symbolism, European rituals of cleanness seek to kill off germs, whereas primitive rituals of cleanness seek to ward off spirits. However, Douglas states that it is not enough to limit the differentiation between European rituals and primitive ritual to simply hygienic benefits. She claims that the modern conception of dirt is synonymous with the knowledge of germs and bacteria;If one removes the notions of bacteria and hygiene from the concept of dirt, all that remains is the symbolism of dirt;

==== Dirt as disorder in the symbolic structure ====
Douglas then proceeds to establish the notion that humans have a tendency to structure objects and situations around them into schema, well-organized systems. The older people become, the more confidence and experiences they establish into their structures. Ideally, the more consistent an experience is within a structure, the more confidence an individual will place on that experience. As a result, when an individual encounters facts or tendencies that disrupt the structure, they will largely ignore it. What is deemed impure are objects or phenomena that do not correspond with the pre-existing social or symbolic structure. Douglas associates dirt as a form of disruption to order, therefore it must be excluded in order to maintain the integrity of the system.

==== &quot;The Abomination of Leviticus&quot; ====
Mary Douglas is also known for her interpretation of the book of &quot;Leviticus&quot;, in the chapter &quot;The Abomination of Leviticus&quot; in &quot;Purity and Danger&quot;, in which she analyses the dietary laws of Leviticus II through a structuralist and symbolist point of view, and for her role in creating the Cultural Theory of risk. In &quot;The Abomination of Leviticus&quot; she states that the dietary laws were not based on medical materialism, but rather social boundaries, deeming that what is pure and impure is a way for a society to structure human experiences. At heart, what matters is using themes such as purity, separation and defilement to bring about order and structure to unorganized experiences. In Leviticus II, when categorizing which animals are authorized to be consumed, the pig is prohibited because while it has cloven feet like cows or goats, it does not produce milk, making it an anomaly within the structure of the world, hence its exclusion from the structure and its categorization as an impure animal.

=== &quot;Natural Symbols&quot; (1970) ===
In &quot;Natural Symbols&quot; (first published 1970), Douglas introduced the interrelated concepts of &quot;group&quot; (how clearly defined an individual&#x27;s social position is as inside or outside a bounded social group) and &quot;grid&quot; (how clearly defined an individual&#x27;s social role is within networks of social privileges, claims and obligations). The group-grid pattern was to be refined and redeployed in laying the foundations of Cultural Theory.

==Contributions to the study of misfortune, risk and blame==

=== &quot;Blaming individuals for using supernatural power to cause misfortune: witchcraft and sorcery accusation&quot; ===

Douglas developed the insights of her Oxford supervisor, Evans-Pritchard. In his classic study of the ways in which the Azande responded to events that caused misfortune such as illness or death. Evans-Pritchard observed that while the Azande were aware of the technical causes of such events, they attributed the social consequences (the harm) to human agency in the form of witchcraft. Mary Douglas, in her fieldwork observed that the Lele blamed sorcerers for their misfortunes. Younger Lele men who had limited access to resources could counteract their dependence on the elders who controlled social, economic and political resources with accusations of sorcery. Thus younger men attributed their various misfortunes to their older relatives who were members of and had access to the knowledge of religious cults and the economic benefits of such membership.

In 1968, when Evans-Pritchard retired from the Chair of Social Anthropology at Oxford, the learned society which he founded in 1946, the Association of Social Anthropologists decided to hold a conference in his honour. Since it was just over 30 years since the publication of Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft Among the Azande&quot;, the ASA invited Mary Douglas to organise a conference focusing on witchcraft. Douglas brought together anthropologists and historians who explored the ways in which accusations of the use of supernatural powers by individuals were used to explain misfortune and allocate blame in different part of the globe and in different historical periods.

=== &quot;Religion, sin and the allocation of blame&quot; ===
When Douglas revisited the Lele in the 1987 she observed important changes in the blaming system. Many younger Lele had taken advantage of colonial education and had migrated to the capital, Kinshasa where they thrived as professionals, entrepreneurs and Catholic priests. Older Lele, who remained in the villages, were by the 1980s experiencing economic hardship. While the older Lele retained allegiance to traditional beliefs and practices, younger Lele increasingly adopted Christianity. These changes led to a major change in blaming. Rather than being part of traditional religion and part of a balancing act between generations, sorcery accusation became a tool used by young Lele priests to attack and destroy traditional religion through purging the older sorcerers and their sinful practices.

Mary Douglas also used historical anthropology to explore the ways in which the concept of sin was used to explain misfortune and allocate blame. She examined the ways in which leprosy was linked to sin and used in 12th century Europe to allocate blame and protect from threats to the social order. The disease ‘was associated with sin, it was a chastisement by the hand of God’.

=== &quot;Modernity and risk: a new way of allocating blame&quot; ===

Douglas observed that in contemporary societies in the global North, risk has, for the most part, replaced witchcraft/sorcery and sin as the explanation for misfortune. Risk appears to be a very different sort of concept to witchcraft and sin, it is secular and based on rationality while both witchcraft and sin are grounded in the belief in supernatural powers. However, Douglas argues that they perform the same function, they explain and allocate responsibility for misfortune to human agents. In the case of sin, the sinful individual has failed to heed warnings about their sinful behaviour and there is divine retribution. In the case of risk, the accountable individual has failed to properly assess and mitigate the risk and should be publicly named and shamed for this failure.

While the concept of an accident, a random chance event, exists in contemporary society, there is strong pressure to ascribe all misfortune to human error, especially by those who have suffered its direct consequences. As the sociologist, Judith Green notes disasters and tragedies ‘are [by definition] the outcome of poorly managed risks, rather than the inevitable misfortunes that we all suffer from time-to-time’. This is perhaps most evident in public inquiries, state sanctioned investigations into existential misfortunes. Those individuals blamed in such Inquiries may see themselves as scapegoats sacrificed because they failed to prevent an event that they could not have predicted. Sharon Shoesmith, the former Islington Director of Education and Children’s Social Care, was sacked and blamed for the death of ‘Baby P’. In her account of events, Shoesmith argued that modern society’s inability to accept that some risks are unavoidable, and the fact that in the wake of a scandal a political and media feeding frenzy will not abate until someone is ‘named, blamed and shamed’, create huge challenges for those who work within particularly salient, sensitive and arguably invidious parts of the public sector.

<doc id="1171931" wikidata="Q4728351" url="?curid=1171931" title="All-figure dialling">
<text>All-figure dialling was a telephone numbering plan introduced in the United Kingdom starting in 1966 that replaced the traditional system of using initial letters of telephone exchange names as the first part of a telephone number. The change affected subscriber numbers in the cities of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester which used the Director telephone system.

The transition to all-figure dialling occurred between 1966 and 1970 and was initiated by the General Post Office. It was one of the first in a series of changes in the organisation of British telephone numbers. In most areas the change initially only affected the presentation of area codes, but in six multiple exchange director areas such as the London telephone area, the change required the introduction of new local exchange codes. The period of parallel operation of the old and new systems ended in 1970 with the &quot;ANN: All-figure Numbers Now&quot; advertising campaign. The changes were required for the continued good operation of the telephone service, but were considered controversial at the time. They occurred because of the increase in subscriber-dialled international calls from countries which used a different mapping of letters to numbers on the rotary dial and because the number of useful exchange mnemonics that were possible under the existing system was being exhausted. The implementation of all-figure dialling and new local exchange codes in director areas allowed changes to be made to routing of calls into and out of these areas.

==Background==
In six metropolitan areas around major cities, groups of multiple exchanges operated in a director telephone system. The six cities were Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester. In these areas the first three digits of the seven digit subscriber number was presented as letters chosen to represent the local exchange within the director area. The letters and numbers corresponded as follows:
For example, in the London telephone area a subscriber number on the Wimbledon exchange was presented WIM 1234 and dialled as 946 1234. These local exchange codes (introduced in London in 1927) predated the introduction of STD codes by several decades.

The General Post Office issued subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes for most areas during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The codes allowed subscribers to call other exchanges directly and without the assistance of an operator. To help the public remember the new codes they were represented by a recognisable combination of two letters and a number. 

Outside the director areas, at least three character codes were dialled after an initial &#x27;0&#x27; which gave trunk access. For example, the code for Bath was BA5, which was dialled as 0225. The rotary dial included the corresponding letters next to the appropriate digits.

==Problems==
The continued operation of the system presented a number of problems. As STD was expanded to non-director areas, every telephone which had been issued with no letters on the dials needed to be altered for alphanumeric dialling. With the growth of subscriber dialled international calls from abroad and the incompatible allocation of letters to numbers on foreign dials, there was an increase in the number of dialling errors. In London the number of three letter codes that could be used to represent exchanges had been exhausted. Significant changes were planned to the way calls in and out of the London telephone area were to be handled that required exchange codes to be grouped together into sectors and it was not possible to implement these changes without a transition to all-figure dialling. The General Post Office produced a pamphlet &quot;All-Figure Telephone Numbers&quot; in 1965 which summarised the problems.

==Changes==
From 1966, UK telephone dialling codes ceased to be represented with letters. In most areas this did not require any changes to the telephone codes or numbers, e.g. the Sevenoaks STD code changed from 0SE2 to its numerical equivalent 0732. However, in Director telephone areas such as the London telephone area, the changes permitted many new exchange codes to be issued that did not correspond to letters representing the geographic locations. As &#x27;1&#x27; was also available for the &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; digits, this allowed many more exchange codes such as 211, 212, 221 to be used. At the same time, many local exchange codes were altered in order to group them into geographic sectors (e.g. GROsvenor became 499 rather than 470) to eliminate the need for all incoming calls to be routed via central London.

In the Director areas the old codes continued to work in parallel with new codes until 1970 when the &quot;ANN: All-figure Numbers Now&quot; advertising campaign prompted callers to dial only the new codes. By October 1969 in Edinburgh 79% of calls were being made using the new local exchange codes, in London 72% and in Glasgow 43%. London was the first to withdraw the ability to dial the old codes in January 1970 and from April the parallel operation was withdrawn in the other five cities.

The change to all-figure dialling was controversial and was debated in both Houses of Parliament. Among the criticisms of the new system was the perceived difficulty in remembering telephone numbers, the inability to easily recognise where a telephone number was located and the need for a change so soon after the implementation of subscriber trunk dialling.

<text>Seven Second Delay is a comedy radio show broadcast on radio station WFMU. It has been hosted by Ken Freedman and Andy Breckman since the early 1990s. The show is self described as &quot;on air radio stunts.&quot;

In March 2022, as part of a radio station fundraiser, the show&#x27;s name officially changed to &quot;Dinner at Andy&#x27;s&quot; for the next year. This followed a similar stunt in March 2021, in which the show&#x27;s name officially changed to &quot;Andy and Ken&#x27;s Fuzzy Glove Hour&quot; for one year.

In February 2007, the show received wide attention for a program in which an entry to the &quot;Metropolitan Diary&quot; section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was faked. The faked entry was submitted to the &quot;Times&quot; by the program&#x27;s blogmaster, who then lied to the editor who called to fact-check. After the false story ran in the &quot;Times,&quot; many blogs mocked the paper for it, and the &quot;Times&quot; editor called the blogmaster to berate her and threaten her future academic and career prospects. Freedman and Breckman called the editor on the air the next week to apologize (and to correct the error by causing an incident in real life that mirrored the one they had earlier fabricated). Subsequently, the story circulated that the &quot;Times&quot; might, as a result of this incident, cancel the &quot;Metropolitan Diary&quot; altogether.

<text>The Race of Champions (ROC) is an international motorsport event held at the start or end of each year, featuring some of the world&#x27;s best racing and rally drivers from Formula One, World Rally Championship, IndyCar, NASCAR, sports car racing, touring car racing, and motorcycle racing, who compete against each other in identical cars.

The race was first organised in 1988 by former rally driver Michèle Mouton and Fredrik Johnsson, IMP (International Media Productions) President. Originally the event was a competition between the world&#x27;s best rally drivers, but has since expanded to include top competitors from most other motorsport disciplines.

The top individual overall in the Race Of Champions is given the title &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; and receives the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy. The ROC Nations&#x27; Cup was added in 1999 and now features teams of two drivers who compete for their country.

The event has taken place in several venues, including 12 years on Gran Canaria from 1992 to 2003. From 2004 to 2019, the event was held in major sporting stadiums, including the Stade de France in Paris, Wembley Stadium in London, the Beijing National Stadium, Düsseldorf&#x27;s ESPRIT arena, the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok, Olympic Stadium, the Marlins Park in Miami, the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh, and the Foro Sol in Mexico City. However in 2014, the event was held at the Bushy Park circuit in Barbados, and the 2022 edition was held on a frozen Baltic Sea in northern Sweden.

==Overview==
 In the Race of Champions, the individual drivers compete head-to-head in one race around the track. The drivers are gradually eliminated using a round-robin format, with the best eight entering a knockout tournament. Prior to the Race of Champions, eight teams of two drivers compete in the ROC Nations&#x27; Cup using a similar format.
In both the ROC Nations&#x27; Cup and the Race of Champions, the final consists of three runs, with the team or driver that achieves two victories first crowned champion.

===Cars===
The cars used in the Race Of Champions vary from year to year. Prior to each run, a type of car is assigned to both of the drivers, with each machine being identical in every respect. Over the course of the event, each driver will get to drive several different cars.

In 2012, the cars selected for the Race Of Champions included a ROC Car buggy, the KTM X-Bow, the Audi R8 LMS, the Lamborghini Gallardo SuperTrofeo, the VW Scirocco R-Cup and the NASCAR European Stock Car.

In 2022, the cars selected included the FIA RX2e, the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport and the off-road Polaris RZR PRO XP. SuperCar Lites were also used and powered by 100% fossil-free biofuel.
==History==
===Early events (1988–1991)===

The first-ever Race of Champions was held in 1988 at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry near Paris, in memory of Henri Toivonen, who died while leading the 1986 Tour de Corse, and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the world championship for rally drivers.

The inaugural cast included all the eight world rally champions from 1979 to 1988; Björn Waldegård, Walter Röhrl, Ari Vatanen, Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Timo Salonen, Juha Kankkunen and Miki Biasion. The final was a battle between two &quot;Flying Finns&quot;, in which Kankkunen beat Salonen to become the first &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;. The cars used at the first event were Audi Quattro S1, BMW M3, Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, Lancia Delta Integrale, Opel Manta 400 and Peugeot 205 Turbo 16.

The following years saw new events in addition to the main race. The &quot;International Rally Masters&quot;, started in 1990, was designed to offer the season&#x27;s best drivers, who were yet to win a championship title, the chance to win a spot in the main Race of Champions. The &quot;Classic Rally Masters&quot;, first contested in 1994, was a &quot;historic&quot; Race of Champions competed with pre-1965 Porsche 911s. These two events have since been discontinued.

From 1989 until 1991, there were one-off appearances at the Nürburgring, Barcelona and Madrid.

===Gran Canaria (1992–2003)===

The event found a permanent home for the next 12 years at the Ciudad Deportiva Islas Canarias venue on Gran Canaria starting from 1992. It was during this period that the emphasis on rally champions faded. The Nations&#x27; Cup was introduced in 1999, bringing in circuit racing drivers and motorcyclists to the event for the first time, with 2001 marking the first time that non-rally drivers were eligible to compete for the main title.

2003 was the last time the event would be held on Gran Canaria, the event switching to stadium-based tracks from 2004. The change from gravel to tarmac circuits saw rally drivers lose their dominance, and by 2007 only a handful of rally drivers were present, with the majority made up of circuit racing drivers from F1, touring cars and sportscars.

===Saint-Denis (2004–2006)===
The 2004 Race of Champions took place on December 6 at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The individual event was won by Heikki Kovalainen, the first non-rally driver to win the crown, and the Nations&#x27; Cup by Jean Alesi and Sébastien Loeb representing France. There was also a special &quot;World Champions Challenge&quot; race held between 2004 Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher and 2004 World Rally champion Sébastien Loeb, which Schumacher won. 
The 2005 event took place on December 3. The individual event was won by Sébastien Loeb after Tom Kristensen crashed out of the final, and the Nations&#x27; Cup event was won by Tom Kristensen and Mattias Ekström representing Scandinavia.
The 2006 event took place on December 16. The Nations&#x27; Cup was competed first and the event was won by Finland, with Heikki Kovalainen beating United States&#x27; Travis Pastrana on the final round. Kovalainen&#x27;s teammate was the two-time World Rally Champion Marcus Grönholm, whereas Pastrana drove all the rounds for the US team, after both Jimmie Johnson and his replacement, Scott Speed, had to withdraw from competing due to injuries.

The individual event and the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy was won by Mattias Ekström of Sweden. He beat Kovalainen by 0.0002 seconds in the semi-finals, and then defending champion, Sébastien Loeb of France, in the finals.

===London (2007–2008)===
The 2007 Race of Champions took place on December 16 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. The Nations&#x27; Cup took place at the start of the afternoon and was won by Germany over Finland. The individual event followed and the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy was won by Mattias Ekström of Sweden, beating Michael Schumacher of Germany in the final.

The 2008 event took place on December 14. Germany retained their Nations&#x27; Cup title by beating the Scandinavian team in the final, while Sébastien Loeb overcame the recently retired F1 stalwart David Coulthard to win the individuals&#x27; event.

=== Beijing (2009) ===
The 2009 Race of Champions took place in Beijing&#x27;s National Stadium on November 3–4. For the first time, regional finals were held to help determine the competitors for the Nations&#x27; Cup, with Monaco earning the right to compete in the main event after beating teams from Italy, Spain and Portugal at an event held in Porto on June 6–7.

Germany beat Great Britain to win the Nations&#x27; Cup for the third successive time, with Mattias Ekström beating Michael Schumacher to claim the individual title in a re-run of the 2007 final.

=== Düsseldorf (2010–2011) ===
The 2010 Race of Champions took place in Düsseldorf&#x27;s Esprit Arena on November 27–28. Germany retained their Nations&#x27; Cup crown in front of their home crowd, once again beating Great Britain, while Portugal&#x27;s Filipe Albuquerque was a surprise winner of the individual event after beating newly crowned F1 champion Sebastian Vettel in the semi-final and Sébastien Loeb in the final.

The 2011 event was due to take place in Frankfurt&#x27;s Commerzbank-Arena on December 3–4, but after Eintracht Frankfurt&#x27;s relegation to German football&#x27;s Second Division, the stadium could no longer host the event on those dates. The Race of Champions was held in the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf, just as in 2010.

Germany secured their fifth successive Nations&#x27; Cup title, beating the Nordic team in the final, while up-and-coming rally star Sébastien Ogier beat Le Mans legend Tom Kristensen in the final to clinch the individual crown.

===Bangkok (2012–2013)===

<doc id="1171944" wikidata="Q325101" url="?curid=1171944" title="Enkephalin">
<text>An enkephalin is a pentapeptide involved in regulating nociception (pain sensation) in the body. The enkephalins are termed endogenous ligands, as they are internally derived (and therefore endogenous) and bind as ligands to the body&#x27;s opioid receptors. Discovered in 1975, two forms of enkephalin have been found, one containing leucine (&quot;leu&quot;), and the other containing methionine (&quot;met&quot;). Both are products of the proenkephalin gene.
* Met-enkephalin is Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met.
* Leu-enkephalin is Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu.

==Endogenous opioid peptides==
There are three well-characterized families of opioid peptides produced by the body: enkephalins, β-endorphin, and dynorphins. The met-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded for by the enkephalin gene; the leu-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded for by both the enkephalin gene and the dynorphin gene. The proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC) also contains the met-enkephalin sequence on the N-terminus of beta-endorphin, but the endorphin peptide is not processed into enkephalin.

==Effects on stress==

Enkephalin is also considered a neuropeptide, which in the human body performs as an important signaling molecule in the brain. Enkephalins are found in high concentration in the brain as well as in the cells of adrenal medulla. In response to pain, norepinephrine, a hormone that is activated in fight-or-flight response, is released along with endorphins. A 2017 study indicates that this polypeptide may be linked to brain functioning during the stress response, especially in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This research has suggested that, as part of the stress response, several met-enkephalin analogs have increased activity in the hippocampus, while leu-enkephalin analogs as well as somatostatins are downregulated during stress. Stressors may impact neuropeptides whose action is localized to a specific brain region.

==Enkephalin receptor==

The receptors for enkephalin are the delta opioid receptors and mu opioid receptors. Opioid receptors are a group of G-protein-coupled receptors, with other opioids as ligands as well. The other endogenous opioids are dynorphins (that bind to kappa receptors), endorphins (mu receptors), endomorphins, and nociceptin-orphanin FQ. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).

<doc id="1171945" wikidata="Q447404" url="?curid=1171945" title="Nevada Barr">
<text>Nevada Barr (born March 1, 1952) is an American author of mystery fiction. She is known for her Anna Pigeon series, which is primarily set in a series of national parks and other protected areas of the United States.

==Early life==
Although Barr was born in Yerington, Nevada, she was named not after her state of birth but after a character in one of her father&#x27;s favorite books.

She grew up in Johnstonville, California, a place near Susanville, California in the far northern section of California, one of two daughters. Her parents ran a small airport in Susanville, where her mother was both a pilot and a mechanic.

In her teenage years she learned to pilot a plane from her mother. Barr received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech and drama, and master&#x27;s degree in acting at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, in southern California. She finished her education at the University of California, Irvine.

==Artistic career==
Barr trained in drama and was a professional actor on stage and in voice-overs for 18 years after receiving her master&#x27;s degree at University of California at Irvine. She began writing in those years. She lived in New York City and Minneapolis and had a brief early marriage before moving to Clinton, Mississippi, to work as a Park Ranger and where she married her second husband.

When Barr&#x27;s first husband changed careers from being a theatre director and became interested in the environmental movement, she began working as a seasonal park ranger in the summer at several National Parks. Her first permanent park ranger job was on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. Barr began writing in earnest in 1978, when she was 26. Her first book was historical, titled Bittersweet was published in 1984. Her first mystery novel &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; was published in 1993. This won two awards as a first novel.

That first novel featured the character of Anna Pigeon, which character she conceived while working at her second seasonal job in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas. Pigeon is a law enforcement ranger with the United States National Park Service. The first mystery novel became first in a series. The books in the series take place in various national parks (and other protected areas) where Pigeon solves murders that are often related to natural resource issues. The Anna Pigeon character shares several similarities with Barr, such as working as a park ranger and having had a husband who worked in the theater in New York City.

Barr became a full-time writer when her books began to achieve commercial success.

She began painting in 1996, added to her writing, and her work in the National Park Service.

She moved to New Orleans after her third marriage to Donald Paxton and now lives in Oregon.

== Personal life ==
While in her acting career, Barr had a brief first marriage. They were both in theatre. Her husband developed an interest in the physical environment and took a position in the National Park Service. This sparked a similar interest in Barr. She followed him and secured a position as a seasonal ranger at Isle Royal National Park. She then worked as a seasonal ranger at Guadaloupe Mts and then Mesa Verde. When her marriage ended she returned home to her mother in California. In 1994 she got a permanent position as a Park Ranger on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. She was the first female law enforcement ranger to work on the Parkway. 
She met her second husband, a second generation Park Ranger also working on The Trace. By this time she&#x27;d successfully started her Anna Pigeon mystery series based on a female Park Ranger and set in National Parks. Her husband took an early retirement in 1996 and shortly after, Nevada resigned her position to write full time. With her husband assisting in research and acting as her personal assistant, she published a book a year until their divorce in 2006. Shortly after she remarried and moved to New Orleans and continued to write and paint. She now lives in Oregon with her husband.

<text>Carol Ann Blazejowski (born September 29, 1956) is an American former basketball player and the former president and general manager of the New York Liberty of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Blazejowski was inducted in the inaugural class at the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Family==
Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Blazejowski is the daughter of Leon and Grace (John) Blazejowski. She resides with her family in Nutley, New Jersey. She is an out lesbian.

==College and amateur career==
Using a jump shot patterned after what she saw in televised professional games, Blazejowski became one of the greatest scorers in the history of women&#x27;s basketball, although she didn&#x27;t begin serious competition until her senior year at Cranford High School in Cranford, New Jersey.

At Montclair State College in Montclair, New Jersey, the 5-foot-10 (1.78 m) forward was a three-time All-American, from 1976 through 1978. Blazejowski won the inaugural Wade Trophy as the nation&#x27;s finest collegiate woman player in 1978. She led the nation in scoring with 33.5 points per game in 1976/77 and 38.6 points per game in 1977/78. Blazejowski scored 40 or more points in each of her last three games, including the semifinal loss to eventual champion UCLA. Sports Illustrated would call Blazejowski, &quot;the most relentlessly exciting performer in the history of women&#x27;s basketball&quot;. She set a Madison Square Garden record for either sex with 52 points in a 1977 game against Queens College. Similar to all-time men&#x27;s collegiate scoring record holder, Pete Maravich, &quot;The Blaze&quot; played during an era without the three-point shot.

After finishing her college career, Blazejowski played two seasons of AAU basketball with the Allentown, Pennsylvania, Crestettes. She often scored over 40 points in a game, and led the team to the semifinals both years, and once to a second-place finish. The leading scorer on the national team that won the 1979 world championship, she was chosen for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, but her hopes for a gold medal were crushed after the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics.

===Montclair State College statistics===

==USA Basketball==
Only an alternate on the 1976 Olympic team, Blazejowski led the 1977 World University Games team in scoring and had 38 points in a losing effort against the Soviet Union.

Blazejowski traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico to take part in the 1979 Pan American Games. The USA team won their first five games to advance to the gold medal game, but faced Cuba in the final, and lost 91–86 to take the silver medal. Blazejowski scored 10.2 points per game.

Blazejowski was named to the team representing the US at the 1979 World University Games, held in Mexico City, Mexico. The USA team won all seven games to take the gold medal. The USA team played and beat Cuba twice, the team that had defeated them at the Pan Am games. Blazejowski was the leading scorer for the USA team, with 18.4 points per game.

The National team representing the USA had not won a World Championship since 1957. In 1979, the World Championships were held in Seoul, South Korea. Blazejowski was one of the twelve player squad. In the opening game against host South Korea, the USA team was upset, despite 23 points from Blazejowski. The USA team then faced Italy, and had a close call, winning but just two points 66–64. In the final game, the USA faced Canada, who had not lost. With the USA 4–1 record, the USA did not simply need to win, but need to win by more than 13 points to secure the gold. The USA ended up winning the game by 16 points, thus securing the gold with only three points to spare. Blazejowski was the leading scorer for the USA team with 18.7 points per game.

Blazejowski was named to the team representing the US at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team won all six games en route to the gold medal. Blazejowski was named to the Jones Cup All-Tournament Team.

Blazejowski was named to the team scheduled to represent the US at the 1980 Olympics, but the USA chose not to participate in the Olympics that year.

==Professional playing career==
In 1980, Blazejowski became the highest-paid player in the Women&#x27;s Pro Basketball League, signing a three-year contract for a reported $150,000 with the New Jersey Gems. However, the league folded after her first season, effectively ending her playing career.

==Executive career==
After serving six years working in the front office of the National Basketball Association, Blazejowski was named vice president and general manager of the WNBA&#x27;s New York Liberty on January 7, 1997. On February 15, 2008, it was announced that Blazejowski was promoted to president of the New York Liberty. On September 20, 2010, the New York Liberty announced her contract would not be extended. On February 22, 2011, it was announced that Blazejowski was hired as Associate Vice President for University Advancement at Montclair State University, rejoining her alma mater.

==Honors and cultural references==
In 1994, Blazejowski was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, as well as, the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. In 1999, she was inducted into the inaugural class of the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Blazejowski is a hidden player in NBA Jam Tournament Edition, accessible via a cheat code. In the game, she possesses impressive three-point shooting abilities. She is also a hidden player in NBA Jam Extreme.

In 2017, Blazejowski was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

The basketball courts at Lincoln Park in Cranford, New Jersey were dedicated in her honor in 2017.

<doc id="1171957" wikidata="Q1429050" url="?curid=1171957" title="Floating rate note">
<text>Floating rate notes (FRNs) are bonds that have a variable coupon, equal to a money market reference rate, like SOFR or federal funds rate, plus a quoted spread (also known as quoted margin). The spread is a rate that remains constant. Almost all FRNs have quarterly coupons, i.e. they pay out interest every three months. At the beginning of each coupon period, the coupon is calculated by taking the fixing of the reference rate for that day and adding the spread. A typical coupon would look like 3 months USD SOFR +0.20%.

==Issuers==
In the United States, banks and financial service companies have been among the largest issuers of these securities. The U.S. Treasury began issuing them in 2014, and government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are important issuers. In Europe, the main issuers are banks.

==Variations==
Some FRNs have special features such as maximum or minimum coupons, called &quot;capped FRNs&quot; and &quot;floored FRNs&quot;. Those with both minimum and maximum coupons are called &quot;collared FRNs&quot;.

&quot;Perpetual FRNs&quot; are another form of FRNs that are also called irredeemable or unrated FRNs and are akin to a form of capital.

FRNs can also be obtained synthetically by the combination of a fixed rate bond and an interest rate swap. This combination is known as an asset swap.

* Perpetual notes (PRN)
* Variable rate notes (VRN)
* Structured FRN
* Reverse FRN
* Capped FRN
* Floored FRN
* Collared FRN
* Step up recovery FRN (SURF)
* Range/corridor/accrual notes
* Leveraged/deleveraged FRN

A deleveraged floating-rate note is one bearing a coupon that is the product of the index and a leverage factor, where the leverage factor is between zero and one. A deleveraged floater, which gives the investor decreased exposure to the underlying index, can be replicated by buying a pure FRN and entering into a swap to pay floating and receive fixed, on a notional amount of less than the face value of the FRN.

Deleveraged FRN = long pure FRN + short (1 - leverage factor) x swap

A leveraged or super floater gives the investor increased exposure to an underlying index: the leverage factor is always greater than one. Leveraged floaters also require a floor, since the coupon rate can never be negative.

Leveraged FRN = long pure FRN + long (leverage factor - 1) x swap + long (leverage factor) x floor

==Risks==

=== Credit risk===
Floating-rate notes issued by corporations, such as banks and financial firms, are subject to credit risk, depending on the credit-worthiness of the issuer. Those issued by the U.S. Treasury, which entered the market in 2014, are traditionally regarded as having minimal credit risk.

=== Interest rate risk ===
Opinion is divided as to the efficacy of floating-rate notes in protecting the investor from interest rate risk. Some believe that these securities carry little interest rate risk because 1) a floating rate note&#x27;s Macaulay Duration is approximately equal to the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment; therefore its price shows very low sensitivity to changes in market rates; and 2) when market rates rise, the expected coupons of the FRN increase in line with the increase in forward rates, which means its price remains constant, as compared to fixed rate bonds, whose prices decline when market rates rise. This point of view holds that floating rate notes are conservative investments for investors who believe market rates will increase.

A somewhat different view is held by author Dr. Annette Thau: &quot;The rationale for floaters is that as interest rates change, resetting the coupon rate... will tend to maintain the price of the bond at or close to par. In practice this has tended not to work out quite as well as had been hoped, for a number of reasons. First, during times of extreme interest rate volatility, rates are not reset quickly enough to prevent price fluctuations. Secondly, the coupon rates of floaters are usually well below those of long-term bonds and often not very attractive when compared to shorter maturity bonds.&quot;

=== Complexity ===
Commenting on the complexity of these securities, Richard S. Wilson of the credit rating firm Fitch Investors Services noted: &quot;Financial engineers worked overtime on floating-rate securities and have created debt instruments with a variety of terms and features different from those of conventional fixed-coupon bonds...The major investment firms with their worldwide trading capabilities participate in these markets 24 hours a day. But floaters are complex instruments, and investors who don&#x27;t understand them should stay away. This applies to individuals as well as institutional portfolio managers.&quot;

==Trading==
Securities dealers make markets in FRNs. They are traded over-the-counter, instead of on a stock exchange. In Europe, most FRNs are liquid, as the biggest investors are banks. In the U.S., FRNs are mostly held to maturity, so the markets aren&#x27;t as liquid. In the wholesale markets, FRNs are typically quoted as a spread over the reference rate.

===Example===
Suppose a new 5 year FRN pays a coupon of 3 months SOFR +0.20%, and is issued at par (100.00). If the perception of the credit-worthiness of the issuer goes down, investors will demand a higher interest rate, say SOFR +0.25%. If a trade is agreed, the price is calculated. In this example, SOFR +0.25% would be roughly equivalent to a price of 99.75. This can be calculated as par, minus the difference between the coupon and the price that was agreed (0.05%), multiplied by the maturity (5 year).

== Yield measures ==
Metrics such as yield to maturity and internal rate of return cannot be used to estimate the potential return from a floating rate note. That is the case because it is impossible to forecast the stream of coupon payments with accuracy, since they are tied to a benchmark that is constantly subject to change. Instead, metrics known as the effective spread and the simple margin can be used.

=== Effective spread ===
The effective spread is the average margin over the benchmark rate that is expected to be earned over the life of the security. For a floating rate note selling at par value, the effective margin is merely the contractual spread over the benchmark rate specified in the note&#x27;s prospectus.

For notes that sell at a discount or premium, finance scholar Dr. Frank Fabozzi outlines a present value approach: project the future coupon cash flows assuming that the benchmark rate does not change and find the discount rate that makes the present value of the future cash flows equal to the market price of the note. That discount rate is the effective spread. This approach takes into account the premium or discount to par value and the time value of money, but suffers from the simplifying assumption that holds the benchmark rate at a single value for the life of the note.

=== Simple margin ===
A simpler approach begins with computing the sum of the quoted spread of the FRN and the capital gain (or loss) an investor will earn if the note is held to maturity:

formula_1

Second, adjust the above for the fact that the note is bought at a discount or premium to the nominal value:

formula_2

<text>Canadian Forces Radio and Television (CFRT), Radiotélévision des Forces canadiennes (RTFC) in French, was a television and radio network system broadcast by satellite to those members of the Canadian Forces ground forces who served overseas in places such as the Middle East, Africa and Europe and, due to popular demand, the service began broadcasting to His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ships in April 2002. The network was not available domestically within Canada.

The network consisted of two separate feeds, one for each of Canada&#x27;s official languages, English and French, sourcing programming from the CBC/Radio-Canada, and commercial networks such as CTV and TVA.

On February 5, 2014, CFRT announced it would cease operations in April 2014. The closure was due to a reduction of Canadian military personnel serving overseas and budget cuts by the Canadian government, as well as advancements in other avenues of television and radio broadcasting. The final broadcast ended April 1, 2014, at 00:00 EST.

Broadcasts to Canadian forces in Europe began in 1951. The &quot;Canadian Forces Network&quot; (CFN), or &quot;Reseau des Forces Canadiennes&quot; (RFC), made radio broadcasts from Brunssum, the Netherlands from 1978 until September 30, 2014, to Brunssum, Ramstein Air Base and Lahr (Baden-Württemberg) in Germany and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Casteau, Belgium. CFN Europe was broadcast on the Astra 1A satellite, until its decommissioning in December 2004, and later on the Eutelsat 9A satellite. 
The network kept Canadian military personnel overseas in touch with Canada and Canadian defence news. In countries where telephone service is difficult, families could send broadcast messages to soldiers abroad through an 800 number.

An earlier Canadian Forces Network was established and operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1945 for Canadian troops in England following the closure of the BBC Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme which had included shows for Canadian military personnel. The station, which transmitted programs to Canadian Forces stationed in Europe after World War II, was established with the cooperation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC and augmented broadcasts by the CBC International Service on shortwave from Canada.

<text>Kongsvinger IL Toppfotball is a Norwegian professional football club from the town of Kongsvinger in Innlandet, founded in 1892. Its home ground is Gjemselund Stadion. It is part of sporting association, Kongsvinger IL.

==History==
Despite limited financial resources, Kongsvinger played in the Norwegian top flight for 17 consecutive seasons between 1983 and 1999. Among the club&#x27;s achievements were a silver medal in the league in 1992, bronze in both 1986 and 1987 and a 1–1 draw against football powerhouse Juventus in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup. Kongsvinger dropped out of the top flight in 1999, in the end struggling both financially and on the pitch. Only two years later another relegation sent the team down to 2. divisjon, the third tier in Norwegian football.

After a mediocre interlude in the 2002 season, former HamKam player Vegard Skogheim took over as head coach at Kongsvinger in 2003, instilling new enthusiasm into a young squad of part-timers. In 2003, the team went undefeated in their division and secured promotion back to the 1. divisjon, the second-highest level. The success continued in 2004, and the newly promoted team surprised many experts by managing third place in the league, and thereby earning the right to two play-off matches for promotion against the club that finished third last in the top division, Bodø/Glimt. Kongsvinger won the first match 1–0, but lost the second 0–4, giving away both the aggregate win and the right to play in the top division to Bodø/Glimt. Kongsvinger finished 1. divisjon as 3rd and qualified for promotion-relegation play-offs once again in the 2009 season. On 6 November, Kongsvinger defeated Sogndal 3–1 at home and faced with Sarpsborg 08. The club lost the first match 3–2 at away ground on 9 November, but won 3–1 at home (5–4 aggregate) on 12 November and returned to Tippeligaen after 10 years absence. The team finished their comeback season in the top flight in 15th place and was relegated to the 1. divisjon for the 2011 season. The club was relegated to the 2. divisjon in 2013. In the 2015 season, Kongsvinger won their group in the 2. divisjon and won promotion to the second tier.

<doc id="1171980" wikidata="Q358865" url="?curid=1171980" title="Bilge pump">
<text>A bilge pump is a water pump used to remove bilge water. Since fuel can be present in the bilge, electric bilge pumps are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge pumps are often fitted with float switches which turn on the pump when the bilge fills to a set level. Since bilge pumps can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary pump.

Ancient bilge force pumps had a number of common uses. Depending on where the pump was located in the hull of the ship, it could be used to suck in sea water into a live fish tank to preserve fish until the ship was docked and the fish ready to be sold. Another use of the force pump was to combat fires. Water would again be sucked in through the bottom of the hull, and then pumped onto the blaze. Yet another suggested use for a force pump was to dispel water from a ship. The pump would be placed near the bottom of the hull so as to suck water out of the ship. Force pumps were used on land as well. They could be used to bring water up from a well or to fill high placed tanks so that water could be pressure pumped from these tanks. These tanks were for household use and/or small-scale irrigation. The force pump was portable and could therefore, as on ships, be used to fight fire.
Force pumps could be made of either wood or bronze. Based on ancient texts, it seems that bronze was the preferred material since it lasted longer and was more easily transported. Wood was easier to build, put together, and repair but was not as durable as bronze. Because these were high-value objects, few are found in shipwrecks; they were often recovered after the ship sank. Force pumps were fairly simple in their construction consisting of a cylinder, a piston, and a few valves. Water would fill the cylinder after which the piston would descend into the cylinder, causing the water to move to a higher placed pipe. The valve would close, locking the water into the higher pipe, and then propelling it in a jet stream.

==Archimedes&#x27; screw==
The Greek writer Athenaeus of Naucratis described how King Hieron II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, &quot;Syracusia&quot;, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. &quot;Syracusia&quot; is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity. According to Athenaeus, she was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among her facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the Archimedes&#x27; screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes&#x27; machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes&#x27; screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes&#x27; screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, but this is disputed due to a lack of actual evidence.

<doc id="1171984" wikidata="Q7265541" url="?curid=1171984" title="QS-21">
<text>QS-21 is a purified plant extract used as a vaccine adjuvant. It is derived from the soap bark tree (&quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot;), which is native to the countries of Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. The crude drug (&quot;Quillajae cortex&quot;, Quillaia) is imported from Peru and Chile.

The extract contains water-soluble triterpene glycosides, which are members of a family of plant-based compounds called saponins. It has been tested as an adjuvant in various vaccines in attempts to improve their efficacy. It is believed to enhance both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

Isolation of QS-21 destroys the soap bark tree, prompting governments to regulate industrial extraction. A semi-synthesis strategy relies on purifying the prosapogenin (triterpene and branched trisaccharide) part of the molecule and adding the rest of QS-21 synthetically, doubling the yield. This semi-synthetic approach has also facilitated experimentation with alternative acyl chain compositions.

QS-21 has been clinically evaluated as a vaccine adjuvant. , it had been tested in more than 3000 patients in 60 clinical trials. It is a component of the AS-01 adjuvant used in the Shingrix vaccine and of the Matrix-M adjuvant used in the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.

Agenus is the sole US-manufacturer of an FDA-approved, patented extract. Supplies are tightly controlled, and the United States has invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act to preserve vaccine raw materials for its own companies.

==Alternative sources==
QS-21 has been made by total chemical synthesis, but required an inefficient 76-step process that is not commercially viable. Several companies have succeeded in isolating the compound from plant tissue cultures of the soapbark plant. A team at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK identified the complete 20-step biosynthetic pathway of QS-21 and cloned it into tobacco. More recently an international team of collaborators succeed in engineering yeast to perform the complete biosynthesis of QS-21. One of the scientists pointed out that the yeast process is around 1000 times faster than trees because only mature trees produce QS-21. ‘Even at the levels we’re producing it, it’s cheaper than producing it from the plant.’

<text>Chili&#x27;s Grill &amp; Bar (stylized as chili&#x27;s) is an American casual dining restaurant chain founded by Larry Lavine in Texas in 1975 and is currently owned and operated by Brinker International.

==History==
Chili&#x27;s first location, a converted postal station on Greenville Avenue in the Vickery Meadows area of Dallas, Texas, opened in 1975. The original Chili&#x27;s on Greenville Avenue moved to a new building on the same site in 1981; It relocated again in 2007.

Lavine&#x27;s concept was to create an informal, full-service dining restaurant with a menu featuring different types of hamburgers offered at an affordable price. The brand grew larger, and by the early 1980s, there were 28 Chili&#x27;s locations in the region, all featuring similar Southwest decor.

In 1983, Lavine sold the brand to restaurant executive Norman E. Brinker, formerly of the Pillsbury restaurant group that owned Bennigan&#x27;s.

==Menu==
Chili&#x27;s serves American food, Tex-Mex cuisine and dishes influenced by Mexican cuisine, such as shrimp tacos, quesadillas, and fajitas.

In addition to their regular menu, the company offers a nutritional menu, allergen menu, and vegetarian menu.

== Advertising ==
&quot;Chili&#x27;s (Welcome to Chili&#x27;s!)&quot; is an advertising jingle used in Chili&#x27;s Restaurant commercials to advertise the restaurant&#x27;s line of baby back ribs. The song was written by Guy Bommarito and produced by Tom Faulkner Productions for GSD&amp;M Advertising of Austin, Texas. Faulkner sings both &quot;I want my baby back, baby back, baby back ribs...&quot; (Which is similar to the Tommy James song &quot;Draggin&#x27; the Line&quot;), as well as the melodic theme. The deep &quot;Bar-B-Q sauce&quot; line was sung by famed New York bass vocalist Willie McCoy. A 1996 rendition of the jingle features a doo-wop quartet, Take 6, singing a cappella. &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine named the song first on its list of &quot;10 songs most likely to get stuck in your head&quot; in 2004. In October 2017, the jingle was revived to advertise Chili&#x27;s new menu, where it was re-conceptualized as &quot;Oh Baby, Chili&#x27;s is Back (Baby, Back, Baby, Back).&quot;

In 2008, the chain aired parody ads for &quot;P. J. Bland&#x27;s,&quot; a fictional restaurant chain with cardboard foods. In 2012, Chili&#x27;s used Wendy Rene&#x27;s Stax single, &quot;Bar-B-Q,&quot; in their TV commercial. In September 2017, Chili&#x27;s dropped about 40 percent of its menu items to focus on burgers, ribs, and fajitas.

In February 2020 Chili&#x27;s announced a new marketing campaign encouraging people to &quot;laugh so hard you pee a little.&quot; In September 2024 Chili&#x27;s announced, that its advertisement campaign is working, while other food chains in the USA still struggle to entice diners into their stores. Store sales increased 14.8 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter of Chili&#x27;s. 

==Locations==
As of 2015, they have 1,580 locations worldwide, including 839 that are company-owned and 741 that are franchised.

==Legal problems==
In October 2008, a Chili&#x27;s Australia franchise was prosecuted and fined A$300,000 by the NSW Office of Industrial Relations for underpaying staff, pressuring employees to sign an Australian workplace agreement, and failing to pay A$45,000 in owed wages by a deadline set by the Office of Industrial Relations. In the same year, Chili&#x27;s announced the permanent closure of all its Australian locations due to poor sales, unprofitability, and non-compliance with the Fair Work Act 2009.

In July 2024, American rap rock group the Beastie Boys filed a lawsuit against Chili&#x27;s parent company Brinker International for copyright infringement, claiming that the group&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Sabotage&quot; has been illegally used to promote Chili&#x27;s in advertisements on social media starting around November 2022.

== Controversies ==

* 2008: On June 5, a woman from Washington named Anne Paskett filed a class-action suit against Brinker International. Paskett and the rest of the plaintiffs claimed that the restaurant chain&#x27;s so-called healthier offerings, like the Chili&#x27;s &quot;Guiltless Black Bean Burger&quot; have nutritional values much different than the ones listed on the menu. Independent laboratory tests were conducted, discovering that the fat content of the items are sometimes double, or even triple, the amount shown on these menus.
* 2009: Brinker International fired a Chili&#x27;s employee for the claim of sexual harassment, only to employ her again after the public outrage. They claimed that her termination was a computer error.
* 2018: Brinker International disclosed that its data network had been breached between March and April 2018, exposing the personally identifiable information of its customers. Subsequently, several customers of Chili&#x27;s filed suit against the company, alleging that its failure to comply with industry standards for information security and implement adequate data security measures to protect its data networks from the potential danger of a data breach had caused them to incur fraudulent charges on their payment cards.
* 2019: Chili&#x27;s Restaurant was fined after an employee fell into a vat of scalding water.
* 2020: Brinker International and its Chili&#x27;s subsidiary paid US$150,000 to settle sexual harassment allegations from five female employees.

== In popular culture ==
Chili&#x27;s was a key location in &quot;The Office&quot; season 2 episode 7 &quot;The Client.&quot; The episode shows Michael and Jan meeting a client at a local Chili&#x27;s restaurant after Michael had changed the location of the meeting from Radisson citing Chili&#x27;s as &quot;the new golf course.&quot; The Chili&#x27;s jingle was also used in &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; where Fat Bastard meets Dr. Evil with the mojo belonging to Austin Powers. When he sees Mini-Me walk out with the money, startling him, he tries to eat him, thinking he is a baby. After attempting to eat Mini-Me, Fat Bastard suggests that Dr. Evil keeps the mojo, and he gets the baby, and then sings the Chili&#x27;s Babyback Ribs song. In Season one of &quot;That &#x27;90s Show,&quot; the recurring character, Fez, mentions Chili&#x27;s is the location where he and his current lover had met, also making a reference to the Babyback Ribs jingle. Chili&#x27;s was mentioned several times in the 2010 road comedy &quot;Due Date&quot;, starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis.

April 5th, 2024, in Austin, Texas, was declared Chili&#x27;s at 45th &amp; Lamar Day.

<text>Wicken is a small village on the edge of The Fens near Soham in East Cambridgeshire, ten miles north east of Cambridge and five miles south of Ely. It is the site of Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve. 

==Geography==
Wicken parish consists principally of fenland covering in eastern Cambridgeshire. Its western border largely follows the course of the River Cam, and its southern border separating it from Burwell follows the winding Wicken Lode, which flows into Reach Lode just before the latter meets the Cam. A fenland waterway forms its eastern border with Soham parish. Since at least the 10th century the parish has also contained the hamlet of Upware in its isolated south-west corner on the Cam.

==History==
East Cambridgeshire is known for its great quantity of archaeological findings from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Of Wicken some Bronze Age activity is known as there are a few subsided barrows. Stone Age flint tools, Bronze Age weapons and Roman coinage have also been found in the parish as well as a few spears and other weapons from the Anglo-Saxon era.

Wicken&#x27;s relative isolation and poverty has meant that several of the late medieval and early modern timber-framed houses survive. The medieval limestone cross which formerly stood on Cross Green was unburied and reinstated there in 1973.

Wicken was listed as &quot;Wicha&quot; in the Domesday Book and &quot;Wiken&quot; in around 1200. The name comes from an Old-English dative plural &quot;wícum&quot; meaning &quot;the dwellings&quot; or &quot;the trading settlement&quot;.

Wicken also has the last twelve-sided smock mill still working in England, having been restored to full working order by a team of volunteers. The mill produces various grades and types of flour, milled using windpower driving two sets of burr crystal mill stones. The mill is open during the first weekend of every month and whenever the sails are turning. The mill is a Grade II* listed building.

The village was struck by a tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

==War memorial==
Near the village green there is a memorial to the men of the area who died in the two World Wars. The name of Bailey is sadly prominent, with three in the First World War and one in the Second World War. There is also a mention of the 50th anniversary of the Women&#x27;s Institute (1965).

==Church==
The church is dedicated to Saint Laurence and is at the eastern end of the village. The newer centre of the village is now some distance away. The church has a nave with three bays, a north and south aisle, a tower that contains five bells, a chancel, a south porch and a large vestry on the north side of the tower. The present building is largely 14th century, with some 13th century stonework.

Interred under the altar are Henry Cromwell, fourth son of Oliver Cromwell along with his wife, some of their children and an unidentified Elizabeth Cromwell.

The church is a Grade II* listed building.

==Village life==
The village&#x27;s only public house, The Maid&#x27;s Head, so named since the mid-18th century, occupied a 15th-century thatched hall house, extended to the west in 1852, until it was hit by a fire in 1983. The building was rebuilt immediately to its original design. Former pubs include The Red Lion, recorded from the late 18th century until it closed in the 1930s, and the Black Horse at the top of Lode Lane, which closed by the 1950s. Upware retains the Five Miles from Anywhere Inn by the river.

The village faces the larger settlement of Soham across a flat expanse of agricultural land, once flooded, and still called Soham Mere.

== Recreation ground ==
The recreation ground is located on Chapel Lane and can be reached by navigating to the postcode CB75XZ. The recreation ground has a MUGA (Multi-use games area), football field with changing rooms and utilities, play equipment, recently added outdoor exercise equipment and zip-wire.

It hosts the popular annual Wicken Beer Festival which is traditionally held on the second Saturday in May of every year.

<doc id="1172000" wikidata="Q7407419" url="?curid=1172000" title="Sam Doble">
<text>Samuel Arthur Doble (9 March 1944 – 17 September 1977) was an English rugby union full-back who played international rugby for England and club rugby for Moseley. He was a Birmingham PE teacher, teaching at Northfield Comprehensive School. Doble was awarded three caps to play for England. He, however, suffered a sudden death in 1977 from cancer at the age of 33.

==Rugby career==
Doble first came to public attention when he scored 581 points for Moseley in the 1971/72 domestic season. His debut was an 18–9 victory over South Africa in Johannesburg, in which he scored 14 points. England were on the back foot early on when they lost prop Stack Stevens to injury and had to contest seven-man scrums for twenty minutes. However, the visiting side&#x27;s makeshift front row did not lose one strike against the head and England gradually took control of the game when Stevens returned. With the forwards keeping the Springboks at bay, Doble scored four penalties and converted Alan Morley&#x27;s second half try from the touchline to help England to a most unlikely victory.

Despite his heroics in South Africa, Sam played in just two more matches, a 9–0 loss to New Zealand early in 1973 and a 25–9 loss to Wales in the following Five Nations campaign. England were outscored by five tries to nil, but Doble signed off his international account with two penalties to augment a drop goal by Dick Cowman.

==Death==
In 1977, Sam died after being diagnosed with melanoma a few years before. His life was honoured with a special match between the Rugby Writers International XV and Moseley later in the year. Thirty years on, the victorious England side of Ellis Park &#x27;72 met up at Twickenham to watch Clive Woodward&#x27;s England beat South Africa 53–3. Doble was the only player missing from the line-up.

<text>Reach is a small village and civil parish on the edge of the fenland in East Cambridgeshire, England at the north end of Devil&#x27;s Dyke, about west of Burwell.

==History==

Reach was an important economic centre in early Anglo-Saxon and Viking times. Goods were loaded at its common hythe (wharf) for transport into the fen waterway system from at least 1100. Reach was a significant producer of clunch, a chalky stone; a new wood has been planted on the old clunch pits, where chalky cliffs are visible from early quarrying. Reach&#x27;s use as a port continued until about 200 years ago.

When the Anglo-Saxons built the Devil&#x27;s Dyke around the 6th century, the northern end of the dyke split the settlement in two (East Reach and West Reach) until part of it was refilled to create the current fair green in the 18th century. East Reach has since vanished, filled in by arable land.

In medieval times, Reach was a hamlet sitting on the border of the parishes of Burwell and Swaffham Prior. It was not until 1961 that it became a separate civil parish. The parish covers an area of . For ecclesiastical purposes it is part of the parish of &#x27;Burwell with Reach&#x27;.

Reach Lode, a Roman canal, still exists, and remains navigable. The village church, originally Holy Trinity School Church and latterly called St Etheldreda&#x27;s, was built in 1860, on the site of the former chapel of St John. The ruined perpendicular arch of the old chapel is visible behind the new church.

On village signs, the name of the village is spelled &quot;Reche&quot;. The name itself derives from &quot;rece&quot; (meaning &quot;strip of land&quot;).

==Reach Fair==

The village is the scene of the Reach Fair, one of England&#x27;s oldest festivals.
The Fair was originally held annually at Rogationtide (which replaced the pagan festival of May Day), and is now held every May Day Bank Holiday. Officially run by the Cambridge Corporation, and opened annually by the Mayor of Cambridge, it has been an annual event for over 800 years since receiving its charter in 1201 from King John.

Reach Fair was historically a grand regional occasion, hosting feasting and parades over three days. The Fair is held on the central fair green, and probably extended down further to Reach Lode in its earlier days. In 2001, on the 800th anniversary of the fair, a plaque commemorating the charter was unveiled on Hill Farm, one of the fair green&#x27;s older buildings.

A custom in the fair is for the mayor and other councillors to throw pennies into the crowd for the young people.

Since 1201, the Bank Holiday Monday fair has been cancelled only four times, twice in the 17th century due to the English Civil War and twice again due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
==Village life==
The village is home to &quot;The Dyke&#x27;s End&quot;, a public house which was saved from closure by the villagers, and which was visited by Prince Charles at that time.

Primary school children attend Swaffham Prior primary school whilst secondary pupils usually go to Bottisham Village College.

<text>Other Worlds, Universe Science Fiction, and Science Stories were three related US magazines edited by Raymond A. Palmer. &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was launched in November 1949 by Palmer&#x27;s Clark Publications and lasted for four years in its first run, with well-received stories such as &quot;Enchanted Village&quot; by A. E. van Vogt and &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;, one of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Martian Chronicle&quot; stories. Since Palmer was both publisher and editor, he was free to follow his own editorial policy, and presented a wide array of science fiction.

Palmer entered a partnership with a Chicago businessman in 1953 to create Bell Publications, and printed &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; from June 1953. Palmer used the new company to abandon &quot;Other Worlds&quot; and launch &quot;Science Stories&quot;, in order to escape from Clark Publications&#x27; financial difficulties. Hence &quot;Science Stories&quot; can be considered a continuation of &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. &quot;Science Stories&quot; was visually attractive but contained no memorable fiction. &quot;Universe&quot;, on the other hand, was drab in appearance, but included some well-received stories, such as Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;The World Well Lost&quot;, which examined homosexuality, a controversial topic for the time.

Palmer&#x27;s Chicago partner lost interest, so Palmer took over both &quot;Science Stories&quot; and &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; under a new company. In 1955 he ceased publication of both magazines and brought back &quot;Other Worlds&quot;, numbering the issues to make the new magazine appear a continuation of both the original &quot;Other Worlds&quot; and also of &quot;Universe&quot;. In this new incarnation the magazine was less successful, but did print Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Falcons of Narabedla&quot;. In 1957 Palmer changed the focus of the magazine to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), retitling it &quot;Flying Saucers from Other Worlds&quot;, and after the September 1957 issue no more fiction appeared. Palmer eventually settled on &quot;Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age&quot; as the title, and in that form it survived until June 1976.

== Publishing history ==

In 1945, Raymond Palmer, the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, published &quot;I Remember Lemuria&quot;, by Richard Shaver, in the March 1945 issue. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, explained all the disasters on Earth as the work of evil robots. Palmer presented the story as a mixture of truth and fiction, and the response from readers was strong enough that he bought more stories from Shaver, and promoted what he called the &quot;Shaver Mystery&quot;. Circulation grew dramatically, but the publisher, Ziff-Davis, became alarmed at the ridicule the stories were drawing in the press, and ordered Palmer to tone down the material. Palmer complied, but planned to leave. He formed his own publishing company, Clark Publications, in 1947, and launched &quot;Fate&quot; in 1948. In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis, and launched &quot;Other Worlds Science Stories&quot; in digest format; the editor was listed as Robert N. Webster, a pseudonym Palmer used to conceal his activities since he was still working at Ziff-Davis when the first issue appeared. Palmer had planned to distribute free copies of the first issue to fans at that year&#x27;s World Science Fiction Convention in Cincinnati. Printing delays meant the magazine did not appear until late in the year. At the convention Palmer announced that &quot;Robert N. Webster&quot; was his pseudonym, and gave the convention organizers the original artwork for the first issue for auction. He also met, and immediately hired, Bea Mahaffey, a Cleveland fan, as his managing editor, starting with the fourth issue, dated May 1950.

Palmer planned another science fiction (sf) title, &quot;Imagination&quot;, to be launched in the fall of 1950, but in June, he suffered a serious accident and was temporarily paralyzed, and Mahaffey took over in his absence. Palmer was able to help with editing both magazines even while in the hospital, but by September he decided to sell &quot;Imagination&quot; to William Hamling, and keep &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. Despite the high cover price of 35 cents, &quot;Other Worlds&quot; did well enough for Palmer to increase the publication frequency from bimonthly to every six weeks, but faced competition from two new magazines launched at about the same time: &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, the first issue of which had appeared at the end of 1949, and &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, which published its first issue in October 1950. Both were very successful, with higher budgets than Palmer was able to afford, and &quot;Other Worlds&quot; suffered as a result. The magazine was doing well enough for Palmer to move it to monthly publication at the end of 1952. It stayed on a regular schedule until the July 1953 issue, but Palmer&#x27;s finances eventually worsened to the point that he was unable to pay his printer.
Palmer was contacted by a Chicago businessman interested in starting a sf magazine, and took the opportunity to resolve his financial problems by forming a new company, Bell Publications, in partnership with the businessman (whose name was never revealed), and starting two magazines: &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Science Stories&quot;. &quot;Universe&quot;&#x27;s first issue appeared in June 1953, while &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was still being published. It was financed by Palmer&#x27;s partner, and intended as a bimonthly, though in fact the first four issues were on a quarterly schedule. It was edited by Palmer and Mahaffey, who used the collective pseudonym &quot;George Bell&quot; for the first two issues. &quot;Science Stories&quot; followed in October, also edited by Palmer and Mahaffey as &quot;George Bell&quot;, and published by Bell Publications; this was effectively the same magazine as &quot;Other Worlds Science Stories&quot;, with &quot;Other Worlds&quot; dropped from the title. In the second issue of &quot;Science Stories&quot;, Palmer explained the reason for the new magazine: &quot;For a variety of reasons—and let&#x27;s be honest, most of them were financial—we had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to discontinue &quot;Other Worlds&quot; and replace it with the magazine you are now reading. We phoned the typesetter, halted work on the August &quot;OW&quot;, and lifted the editorial and stories we needed for &quot;Science Stories&quot; No. 1 from &quot;OW&quot; material on hand&quot;. Subscribers to &quot;Other Worlds&quot; were given the option to continue their subscription with whichever of the two magazines they preferred.
When the anonymous businessman lost interest in the project Palmer bought him out, financed by the sale of his half share in Clark Publications, which had published &quot;Other Worlds&quot; and &quot;Fate&quot;. He founded Palmer Publications and took over the new magazines with &quot;Universe&quot;&#x27;s third issue and &quot;Science Stories&quot;&#x27; second issue, and abandoned the pseudonym. He launched &quot;Mystic Magazine&quot;, which, like &quot;Fate&quot;, published occult material, both fact and fiction. &quot;Science Stories&quot; failed to sell well, and ceased to appear after the April 1954 issue, but &quot;Universe&quot; continued, going bimonthly after the March 1954 issue. A total of ten issues appeared under the title &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot;, and with the May 1955 issue the title &quot;Other Worlds Science Fiction&quot; reappeared. The new version of &quot;Other Worlds&quot; initially carried both &quot;Universe&quot;&#x27;s numbering and the issue numbering from the original run of &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. Palmer closed the offices in Evanston, Illinois, and edited the magazine from his home in Wisconsin; Mahaffey continued to work on the magazine by mail from Cincinnati. From November 1955 the format changed to pulp magazine size: this was against the prevailing market winds, as almost all the pulps had died out by this time. In 1956 an unexpected tax bill forced Palmer to let Mahaffey go, and he ran the magazine by himself from that point on.

The following year Palmer switched the magazine&#x27;s focus to flying saucers. To try to maintain the existing readership while attracting new readers, Palmer emphasized sf and flying saucers in alternate issues: for example, the June 1957 issue was titled &quot;FLYING SAUCERS from Other Worlds&quot;, and the July issue was &quot;Flying Saucers from OTHER WORLDS&quot;. He also hoped that each issue would be kept longer on newsstands if the distributors thought they were dealing with two magazines. The experiment did not last; from the July/August 1958 issue the title was shortened to &quot;Flying Saucers&quot;, and the magazine ceased to carry fiction. Palmer retired to Amherst, Wisconsin, and took over its printing. Bibliographic sources focus on the science fiction issues, and do not index the magazine after 1958, but it continued publication until 1976 as a non-fiction magazine.

==Contents and reception==

Palmer&#x27;s interest in the Shaver Mystery did not abate when he left &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and the lead story for the first issue of &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was Shaver&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Lemuria&quot;, still presented as truth in the guise of fiction. The cover illustration was by Malcolm Smith, a frequent artist for &quot;Amazing.&quot; Palmer declared in the first issue that he wanted to present science fiction from across the spectrum: hard-science stories of the kind that appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and stories representative of the styles of the other leading magazines—&quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, and &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;. Despite this many of the stories in the first issue were routine. Much of the first issue&#x27;s contents were by &quot;Amazing&quot; regulars, and it initially appeared that the new magazine would not be very much different from Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, but within a few issues the quality improved noticeably.

Unlike almost every other sf magazine on the market, &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was edited and published by the same person, which meant there were no constraints on Palmer&#x27;s editorial policy. He attempted to find new and daring material, and in the early years of the magazine, he obtained some of the better stories being published. Mike Ashley, a historian of science fiction, cites Eric Frank Russell&#x27;s &quot;Dear Devil&quot;; &quot;Portrait of a Narcissus&quot; by Raymond F. Jones; &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;, one of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Martian Chronicles&quot; stories; and two stories by A.E. van Vogt: &quot;Enchanted Village&quot;, one of van Vogt&#x27;s best-liked stories, and &quot;War of Nerves&quot;, part of his &quot;Voyage of the Space Beagle&quot; series. Fritz Leiber contributed &quot;The Seven Black Priests&quot;, one of his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, and E.E. Smith, who had become famous for his space operas, switched to fantasy with &quot;Tedric&quot;, which appeared in the March 1953 issue. Poul Anderson and Gordon R. Dickson contributed &quot;Heroes Are Made&quot;, the first in their Hoka series, and Palmer obtained fiction from other well-known writers such as Fredric Brown and Wilson Tucker. Partly because of competition from the newly-launched &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, Palmer was unable to obtain enough material of this quality to fill the magazine, and most of the remaining stories were unremarkable space adventures. Ashley comments that the stigma of the Shaver Mystery clung to Palmer and damaged the magazine; and suggests that much of the best-quality work in &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was due to the influence of Mahaffey, who in Ashley&#x27;s opinion &quot;had excellent taste in fiction&quot;. A high point of the non-fiction pieces was a series of articles by L. Sprague de Camp, abridged from his book &quot;Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History&quot;, which ran from 1952 to 1953. The covers were attractive, often with artwork on both covers, by well-known artists such as Malcolm Smith, Robert Gibson Jones, Harold McCauley, and Hannes Bok.&quot;Science Stories&quot; maintained the same high quality of artwork. The first issue, dated October 1953, was painted by Bok, who also did the interior illustration for Jack Williamson&#x27;s story based on the cover. The remaining three covers were by Virgil Finlay, Albert A. Nuetzell, and Jones; Wendy Bousfield, an sf historian, considers the last one the best, and also singles out the last issue&#x27;s interior illustrations, all by Finlay, for praise. The writing was not up to the standard of the artwork, with Jack Williamson and Mack Reynolds the only two authors whose reputation has lasted. A lower page count meant less non-fiction material and readers&#x27; departments (such as letters) in &quot;Science Stories&quot; than in &quot;Other Worlds&quot;, but Palmer found space for cartoons and advertisements for his own books, such as &quot;The Coming of the Saucers&quot;, written with Kenneth Arnold.

&quot;Science Stories&quot; was visually attractive but lacked memorable fiction. &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; took the opposite approach, with uninteresting covers and poor interior artwork, but it had some good stories in the first two issues, which sf historian E.F. Casebeer attributes to Mahaffey&#x27;s influence. Murray Leinster, Mark Clifton and Mack Reynolds contributed to the early issues, with Robert Bloch, providing &quot;Constant Reader&quot;, Theodore Sturgeon, and &quot;The World Well Lost&quot;; a treatment of homosexuality controversial for the 1950s. Once Palmer became more involved with the magazine again the artwork improved, with Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, and Edd Cartier contributing good interior illustrations. In Casebeer&#x27;s view the Finlay and Lawrence illustrations were the best the magazine had to offer, and he considers the quality of the fiction to have gone downhill after a fairly promising start. In the last three issues the artwork was also weak, with poor quality black-and-white covers and little interior art.

The first issue of the revived &quot;Other Worlds&quot;, in May 1955, had a black-and-white cover picture; later issues returned to colour, though until 1956 these were all reprints of covers from the first incarnation of the magazine. For the cover of the November 1955 issue (the first in pulp format) Palmer reprinted artwork by J. Allen St. John from the back cover of the November 1952 issue; St. John&#x27;s artwork had saved another Palmer magazine, &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, from cancellation in 1939. The quality of the fiction dropped from the occasional highs of the first run of &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. &quot;Falcons of Narabedla&quot;, the first novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley, appeared in 1957, and Palmer also bought her first Darkover novel, &quot;Sword of Aldones&quot;, though he never ran it and eventually returned the manuscript to Bradley. Palmer hoped to publish &quot;Tarzan on Mars&quot;, a novel by Stuart Byrne that used fictional worlds created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but he was unable to get authorization from the Burroughs estate, and had to shelve the idea, however, unauthorized editions have been published since then.

Palmer had long been interested in UFOs, and ran an article in &quot;Other Worlds&quot; in 1951 titled &quot;I Flew in a Flying Saucer&quot;, bylined &quot;Captain A.V.G.&quot;, though Lester del Rey reports in his history of sf magazines that it may have been written by Palmer himself. Eventually Palmer decided to drop science fiction; from June 1957 only three issues—June, July and September—included fiction; thereafter it was a nonfiction magazine about UFOs. He wrote in the following issue that he would print news of flying saucers and rumors, and would debunk any claims he could prove fake. Over the next twenty years he included such fringe ideas such as that the earth was not spherical, and in December 1959 ran an article in &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; that claimed the earth was shaped like a donut, and that flying saucers originated from an unexplored source on the earth&#x27;s surface. In 1965 Palmer published an article by Delmar H. Bryant that debunked the idea that the earth was hollow, but the following year again suggested that the earth might be donut shaped. On the June 1970 issue, the cover picture showed a donut-shaped earth from space; Palmer claimed this was evidence from a satellite photograph.

== Bibliographic details ==
&quot;Other Worlds&quot; was edited by Raymond Palmer and published by Clark Publications from November 1949 to July 1953, and by Palmer Publications from May 1955 until at least November 1957. &quot;Science Stories&quot; and &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; were initially published by Bell Publications, for one and two issues, respectively; thereafter both were published by Palmer Publications. Both magazines were edited by Palmer and Bea Mahaffey. &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Science Stories&quot; were in digest format for all their issues and were priced at 35 cents; &quot;Other Worlds&quot; began as a digest and switched to pulp with the November 1955 issue, and was 35 cents until at least the end of 1958. &quot;Other Worlds&quot; had 160 pages for the first run, and 128 pages when it returned in May 1955, dropping to 96 pages for the pulp issues, until at least the November 1957 issue. Both &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Science Stories&quot; had 128 pages throughout their runs.

After it became a non-fiction magazine, the title changed to &quot;Flying Saucers, The Magazine of Space Conquest&quot; with the July/August 1958 issue. In 1961 the title changed twice more, first to &quot;Flying Saucers, The Magazine of Space Mysteries&quot;, and finally to &quot;Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age&quot;, which it retained until it ceased publication in 1976.

<text>Jenny Belzberg (born Jenny Lavin on January 7, 1928) is a Canadian community activist and philanthropist. A Member of the Order of Canada, she was married to Hyman Belzberg and together they were a prominent force in community and cultural affairs.

==Personal life==
Jenny Belzberg was born in Calgary, Alberta. Her father, Abraham Lavin, was an immigrant from a small village in Russia and came to Canada in 1911 and established a farm in the Cochrane, Calgary area. His first wife died in childbirth, leaving him with a baby daughter, whom he raised with his widowed sister. Six years later he moved back into Calgary and established several different small businesses, including a flour/feed store and service station. Belzberg&#x27;s mother was Sonia Rodnunsky. She immigrated from the eastern regions of Gomel, Russia during the Russian Revolution of 1917, joining relatives in Calgary in 1921. She met Lavin in the city and the two were soon married. After attending Western Canada high school, Belzberg was dissuaded from attending University, since her father believed women did not need secondary education. So, she worked as a clerk and stenographer for the military, the Cunard Shipping Line in Vancouver, and the Dominion Department of Immigration in Calgary. She had known Hyman &quot;Hy&quot; Belzberg&#x27;s younger brothers, Samuel and William, through school, but she never really knew Hy himself even though the two families lived only two blocks apart. She and Hy were set up on a &quot;blind date&quot; and were married in 1948.

Hy was well known in Calgary as the proprietor of Cristy&#x27;s Arcade Furniture and for his involvement in First City, a financial company started by his younger brothers that, along with their personal holdings, at one time controlled assets in excess of $5 billion, before debts ultimately swamped the corporation and led to its fall. The company was acquired by its Swiss bondholders; however, the Belzberg family salvaged a minority stake (15%) via Harrowston Inc., a holding company overseen by Brent Belzberg, the couple&#x27;s oldest son. Hy probably is most famous for having been kidnapped in 1982 near his furniture store, then ultimately freed by his captors. Hy died in 2017.

<doc id="1172028" wikidata="Q1283556" url="?curid=1172028" title="Guy-wire">
<text>A guy-wire, guy-line, guy-rope, down guy, or stay, also called simply a guy, is a tensioned cable designed to add stability to a freestanding structure. They are used commonly for ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast. Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called &quot;towers&quot;. One end of the guy is attached to the structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and buckling strength of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires at a spot where the wires change direction.

Conductive guy cables for radio antenna masts can catch and deflect radiation in unintended directions, so their electrical characteristics must be included in the design. Often the guy wire is divided by strain insulators into isolated sections whose lengths are not resonant with the transmission frequencies.

==Uses==

===Sailboat rigging===
The guys supporting a sailboat mast are called &quot;standing rigging&quot; and in modern boats are stainless steel wire rope. Guys are rigged to the bow and stern, usually as a single guy. Lateral guys attach to &quot;chain plates&quot; port and starboard attached to the hull. Multiple guys are usually installed with spreaders to help keep the mast straight (&quot;in column&quot;). 

Temporary guys are also used. A fore-guy is a line (rope) pulling on the free end of a spar. On a modern sloop-rigged sailboat with a symmetric spinnaker, the spinnaker pole is the spar most commonly controlled by one or more guys.

===Utility pole guy-wires===
Utility poles are buried in the ground and have sufficient strength to stand on their own; guys are needed on some poles only to support unbalanced lateral loads from the utility wires attached to them, or to resist ground movement. Guys are particularly needed on &quot;dead-end&quot; (&quot;anchor&quot;) poles, where a long straight section of wire line ends, or angles off in another direction. To protect the public against faults that might allow utility guy cables to become electrified, they usually have a ceramic strain insulator (&quot;Johnny ball&quot;) or a fiberglass strain insulator inserted near the top, to keep dangerous voltages away from the lower end. The length near the ground is often encased in a yellow plastic reflector to make it more visible, so that people or vehicles do not run into it.
In urban areas with pedestrian traffic around the pole, a variation called a &quot;sidewalk guy&quot; is often used: the guy line extends diagonally from the top of the pole to a spar brace extending out from the middle of the pole, then continues vertically to the ground. Thus, the bottom length of the guy is vertical and does not obstruct headroom, so a sidewalk can pass between the pole and the guy.

An alternative to guy-wires sometimes used on dead-end utility poles is a &quot;push-brace pole&quot;, a diagonal pole with one end set in the ground and the other butting up against the vertica pole, opposite to where a guy cable would attach.

===Antenna mast guy-wires===

Electromagnetic fields from the antennas complicate the design of guys that support mast antennas. Conductive metal guy-wires whose lengths are near to quarter wavelength multiples of the transmitted frequency can distort the radiation pattern of the antenna. This also applies to guy wires of neighboring masts or nearby metal structures. To prevent this, each guy wire is divided by strain insulators into multiple sections, each segment non-resonant at the transmitted wavelength. Cylindrical or egg-shaped porcelain &quot;Johnny ball&quot; insulators (also called &quot;egg insulators&quot;) are usually used. Non-conductive guys of Kevlar fiber (Phillystran) or extruded fiberglass rod are frequently used to not disturb the radiation pattern of the antennas. The strength and low stretch properties of Kevlar fiber approaches that of steel. However, Kevlar is very susceptible to ultraviolet degradation, so it is enclosed in a UV resistant plastic sheath.

The individual sections of conductive guys can develop large charges of static electricity, especially on very tall masts. The voltage caused by this static electricity can be several times larger than that generated by the transmitter. In order to avoid dangerous and unpredictable discharges, the insulators must be designed to withstand this high voltage, which on tall masts results in over-dimensioned backstage insulators. At each backstage insulator, a lightning arrestor in the form of an arc gap is required for the purpose of over-voltage protection in case of lightning strikes. The insulators and arrestors must be maintained carefully, because an insulator failure can result in a mast collapse. Egg insulators have the porcelain in compression and if it fails, the end loops of the guy wires are still intertwined.

AM radio broadcast towers are often fitted with insulators at the mast base and the RF energy is fed at that point. Some are also insulated at the center for feeding the RF energy at that point. Wire rope guys are frequently used and segmented with insulators at several points. Extensive lightning protection is required for insulated towers.

On antennas for long-wave and VLF, the guys may serve an electrical function, either for capacitive lengthening of the mast or for feeding the mast with the radiation power. In these cases, the guys are fixed without an insulator on the mast, but there is at least one insulator in the guy if necessary. If guys are used for feeding the mast with high frequency power it is often possible to use a grounded mast. The power to the guys is fed via wires running from a tuning unit to the feed point on the guys.

=== Crane tag lines ===

When operating a crane, guy wires, known as tag lines, may be connected to unwieldy payloads, allowing ground crew to control rotation and swaying while maintaining a safe distance.

===Firefighting===

They can stabilize aerial firefighting equipment, such as portable water tanks or observation towers, ensuring they remain secure during operations. Additionally, guy wires may support temporary structures, like tents or command centers, set up near a fire scene, and secure communication equipment necessary for coordinating firefighting efforts. In situations where structures are at risk of collapse due to fire damage, guy wires can also help stabilize them temporarily while firefighters work to control the blaze. Guywires can also be used to raise an extension ladder in a technique called a church raise.

==Anchors==
In ground-anchored guys, the structure which attaches the guy-wire to the ground is called an &quot;anchor&quot;. The anchor must be adequate to resist the maximum tensile load of the guy wires; both the dead load of the tension of the wire and the maximum possible live load due to wind. Since the guy wire exerts its force at an angle, the anchor has both vertical and lateral (horizontal) forces on it. The anchor relies on the lateral shear strength of the soil to resist the forces from all of the guys attached to it. Several types of anchor are used:

===Dead man anchors===
In this type, a hole is excavated and an object with a large surface area is placed in it with the guy wire attached, and the hole is backfilled with earth or concrete. In the historical form of dead man anchor, a log is buried horizontally in a trench with the guy attached perpendicularly to its center. Modern forms are the plate anchor, in which the guy is attached to a rod with an eyelet extending from the center of a steel plate buried diagonally, perpendicular to the angle of the guy. In the concrete anchor, a diagonal rod with an eyelet extending in the guy direction is cemented into a hole filled with steel reinforced concrete. A sufficiently massive concrete block on the surface of the ground can also be used as a dead man.

===Screw anchors===
This type consists of a rod with wide screw blades on the end and an eyelet on the other for the guy wire. It is screwed deep into the ground, at the same angle as the guy, by a truck-mounted drill machine. These are commonly used as guy anchors for utility poles since they are quick to install with a truck mounted hydraulic powered auger drive.

===Expanding anchors===
A rod with a pivoted blade on the end is driven into the earth. When the guy wire is attached and tensioned, its force pulls the blade open, &quot;setting&quot; it into the soil. These are often used by the military for rapid mast installations.

===Grouted anchors===
These are used in both soil and rock. A hole is drilled at the angle of the guy. A steel anchor rod with an eye is inserted, and the hole around it is filled with a liquid grout consisting of concrete and an expansion agent or a structural epoxy. When the grout hardens or expands, the anchor is secure.

== Design ==
Guidance for the design of guys on guyed structures, such as lattice towers, guyed masts and chimneys, is given a part of the Eurocode for structural design.

Recommendations for the design of sailing craft rigging are available in an ISO standard.

==Guyed structures==

Historically, guyed structures have been some of the tallest man-made structures in the world. There are also many structures which consist of a freestanding bottom and a guyed top. These are either partially guyed towers or additionally guyed towers, the latter of which may be used temporarily to support tall buildings during their construction.

<text>The is a denomination of the Japanese yen. The current design was first minted in 1959, using Japanese characters known as the &quot;new script&quot; and kanji in the &quot;kaisho&quot; style, and were also minted from 1948 to 1958 using &quot;old-script&quot; Japanese characters in the gothic style. Five-yen coins date to 1870 (when, due to the much higher value of the yen, they were minted in gold). The modern-day coin was first produced in 1948 with a differently styled inscription. This was changed in 1959 and the design has remained unchanged since.

The obverse of the coin depicts a rice plant growing out of the water, with &quot;five yen&quot; written in kanji; the reverse is stamped with &quot;Japan&quot; and the year of issue, also in kanji, separated by sprouts of a tree. The three graphic elements of the coin represent agriculture and fisheries, the key elements of the Japanese first-sector economy. Around the central hole, there is a gear that represents industry. It is the only Japanese coin in circulation to lack Arabic numerals on either side.

==History==
===Gold five yen (1870-1930)===
Five yen coins were first struck in gold for the Japanese government in 1870 at the San Francisco Mint. During this time a new mint was being established at Osaka, which did not receive the gold bullion needed for coinage until the following year. The yen as a unit of currency was officially adopted by the Meiji government in an act signed on June 27, 1871. For this particular denomination, its not known if any five-yen coins dated 1871 (year 4) were actually struck that year as official records have coinage beginning in 1872. The first and second five yen coin designs feature a dragon figure on the obverse surrounded by legends, while the reverse features the emblem of the Imperial family. Each coin was initially struck in .900 fine gold with a weight of 8.3g, and a diameter of 23.8mm. The diameter was later reduced to 21.8mm when the second design was introduced in 1872. Five yen coins continued to be struck uninterrupted until 1879, when for an unknown reason none were recorded as minted. Coinage resumed in 1880 and remained unchanged until 1897 when Japan officially switched from a silver standard to a gold standard. During this time the gold five yen coin was given a third and final new design. The diameter was reduced from 21.8mm down to 16.9mm, and the weight was changed from 8.3 to 4.2 grams. Redemption of old silver coins for new gold coins at par began on October 1, 1897, and lasted until closure on July 31, 1898.

During the Taishō era the production of five yen coins was impacted by World War I as a gold embargo was imposed in 1917 by the United States. Even though this embargo was later lifted in June 1919, the Japanese government continued it by importing gold heavily to re-enforce the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan. Government officials at the time had the opinion that no inflation could take place so long as the percentage of gold cover had not been lowered. This embargo was not absolute however, as it was recorded that some gold coins were paid out between 1920 and 1928 in very small amounts. The gold embargo was later lifted in January 1930, only for it to be re-imposed on December 31, 1931. Five yen coins were last minted in gold during this brief time to act as a reserve for gold certificates. None of these coins were in general use afterwards as the medium of commerce consisted of nonconvertible 5 yen banknotes.

===Modern five yen (1948-)===

Almost 20 years would pass before the Japanese government authorized the production of a new five yen coin. These new coins were first struck in 1948 and are made of a brass alloy consisting of 60 to 70% copper, and 30 to 40% zinc. Using this type of alloy combination is now a remnant from when World War II era weapons were scrapped to produce the coins. These coins feature a pigeon within a circle on one side and the National Diet on the other and were only minted for two years. Two different varieties were made in 1949 which included the old pigeon type coins, and new coins featuring a hole in the center. These first holed five yen coins use an old style Japanese script known as &quot;Kaisho&quot;. The Japanese government added the hole in the center of the coin to save material costs. The overall design of the coin featuring rice, water and a gear on the obverse, and tree sprouts on the reverse has not changed since this time. The final design which is minted today uses a modern style script which was first added in 1959.

Five yen coins made headlines in 1999 in regards to the nuclear accident at Tokai, Ibaraki. Physicists Masuchika Kohno and Yoshinobu Koizumi showed how the coin could be used to estimate neutron dosage to the surrounding population, by measuring its zinc isotope ratios. They concluded that the coin could offer information about the total neutron effect during the accident. The coins could also give insight about shielding modern Japanese houses as the coins were recovered from indoors.

Very few five yen coins were minted between 2009 and 2013 ,making them premium coins for collectors as coins for the latter four years are confined to mint sets. This was due to an increase in the usage of electronic currency which inhibited demand for new coins. Mintage figures recovered in 2014 as general production resumed until 2022, when 5 yen coins were again confined to mint sets.

== Cultural significance ==
The Japanese for &quot;five yen,&quot; &quot;go en&quot; (五円) is a homophone with &quot;go-en&quot; (御縁), &quot;en&quot; being a word for causal connection or relationship, and &quot;go&quot; being a respectful prefix. As a result, five-yen coins are commonly given as donations at Shinto shrines with the intention of establishing a good connection with the deity of the shrine. Several different interpretations of this &quot;luck&quot; exist depending on how many five yen coins are offered. While it is generally said that offering &quot;lucky&quot; 5 yen coins as tribute is good, there are others who disagree. Those who hold this opposing position argue that &quot;perforated coins&quot; such as &quot;5 yen&quot; and &quot;50 yen&quot; are unlucky due to their central holes. Shrines in general depend on offerings in either case to fund maintenance, repairs, and operations for the deity or deities enshrined. There are also other forms of offerings welcomed at shrines depending on the place and customs allowed. According to a priest at Chichibu Shrine, harvested rice was historically given as Shinto deities do not like cash itself as tribute. Five yen coins are also sometimes given as gifts of &quot;good fortune&quot; during the Japanese New Year. These gifts are traditionally given to children in decorated envelopes called , with the total amount of money included depending on age.

==Circulation figures==
===Meiji===

The following are circulation figures for the coins that were minted between the 3rd and the 45th (last) year of Meiji&#x27;s reign. Coins for this period all begin with the Japanese symbol 明治 (Meiji). One yen trade dollars and/or patterns are not included here.

*Inscriptions on Japanese coins from this period are read clockwise from right to left: 
&quot;Year&quot; ← &quot;Number representing year of reign&quot; ← &quot;Emperor&#x27;s name&quot; (Ex: 年 ← 五十三 ← 治明)

===Taishō===
The following are circulation figures for the coins that were minted during the 2nd and 13th year of Taishō&#x27;s reign. Coins from this period all begin with the Japanese symbol 大正 (Taishō).

*Inscriptions on Japanese coins from this period are read clockwise from right to left: 
:&quot;Year&quot; ← &quot;Number representing year of reign&quot; ← &quot;Emperor&#x27;s name&quot; (Ex: 年 ← 三十 ← 正大)

===Shōwa===

The following are circulation dates which cover Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s reign. The dates below correspond with the 23rd to the 64th year (last) of his reign. All five yen coins that were made before 1959 use &quot;kyūjitai&quot;, or old script Japanese. In 1949 only, two different styles of writing were used before a more modern one was established in 1950. This second style of writing was used until 1958 when the current script of Japanese took its place in the following year. Coins for this period will all begin with the Japanese symbol 昭和 (Shōwa).

*Japanese coins are read with a left to right format: 
:&quot;Emperor&#x27;s name&quot; → &quot;Number representing year of reign&quot; → &quot;Year&quot; (Ex: 昭和 → 四十八 → 年).

===Heisei===

The following are circulation dates during the reign of Emperor Akihito (Heisei), who reigned from 1989 until his abdication in April 2019. The first year of his reign is marked with a 元 symbol on the coin as a one-year type. Coins for this period all begin with the kanji characters 平成 (Heisei). Five-yen coins dated between 2010 and 2013 were only released in mint sets.

*Japanese coins are read with a left to right format: 
:&quot;Emperors name&quot; → &quot;Number representing year of reign&quot; → &quot;Year&quot; (Ex: 平成 → 二十六 → 年).

===Reiwa===
The following are circulation dates in the reign of the current Emperor. Naruhito&#x27;s accession to the Crysanthemum Throne took place on May 1, 2019, and he was formally enthroned on October 22, 2019. Coins for this period all begin with the Japanese symbol 令和 (Reiwa). The inaugural year coin (2019) was marked 元 (first) and debuted during the summer of that year.

*Japanese coins are read with a left to right format: 
:&quot;Emperors name&quot; → &quot;Number representing year of reign&quot; → &quot;Year&quot; (Ex: 令和 → 二 → 年).

<doc id="1172067" wikidata="Q2250696" url="?curid=1172067" title="Catch-22 (logic)">
<text>A catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules or limitations. The term was coined by Joseph Heller, who used it in his 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it (e.g. the only way to qualify for a loan is to prove to the bank that you do not need a loan). One connotation of the term is that the creators of the &quot;catch-22&quot; situation have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.

== Origin and meaning ==
Joseph Heller coined the term in his 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;, which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in World War II. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes &quot;Catch-22&quot; to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanity—hoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missions—demonstrates his own sanity in creating the request and thus cannot be declared insane. This phrase also means a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.

Different formulations of &quot;Catch-22&quot; appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian (the protagonist) is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his commanding officer tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer&#x27;s superiors.

In a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:

According to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman&#x27;s narrative defines &quot;Catch-22&quot; more directly as the &quot;brutal operation of power&quot;, stripping away the &quot;bogus sophistication&quot; of the earlier scenarios.

=== Other appearances in the novel ===
Besides referring to an unsolvable logical dilemma, Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of private first class after any promotion. Through courts-martial for going AWOL, he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.

At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.

At one point, Captain Black attempts to press Milo into depriving Major Major of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, &quot;You&#x27;re not against Catch-22, are you?&quot;

In chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.

=== Significance of the number 22 ===

Heller originally wanted to call the phrase (and hence, the book) by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for euphony. The title was originally &quot;Catch-18&quot;, but Heller changed it after the popular &quot;Mila 18&quot; was published a short time beforehand.

== Usage ==
The term &quot;catch-22&quot; has filtered into common usage in the English language. In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.

James E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a &quot;catch-22&quot; has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write of the rules of high school and colleges that:

This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen&#x27;s first encounter with organizations that may profess &#x27;open&#x27; and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that exempts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.

Along with George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;doublethink&quot;, &quot;catch-22&quot; has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.

A significant type of definition of alternative medicine has been termed a catch-22. In a 1998 editorial co-authored by Marcia Angell, a former editor of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, argued that:

It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine—conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.

This definition has been described by Robert L. Park as a logical catch-22 which ensures that any complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) method which is proven to work &quot;would no longer be CAM, it would simply be medicine.&quot;

U.S. Circuit Judge Don Willett referred to qualified immunity, which requires a violation of constitutional rights to have been previously established in order for a victim to claim damages, as a catch-22: &quot;Section 1983 meets Catch-22. Important constitutional questions go unanswered precisely because those questions are yet unanswered. Courts then rely on that judicial silence to conclude there&#x27;s no equivalent case on the books. No precedent no clearly established law no liability. An Escherian Stairwell. Heads government wins, tails plaintiff loses.&quot;

== Logic ==
The archetypal &quot;catch-22&quot;, as formulated by Joseph Heller, involves the case of John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces bombardier, who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron&#x27;s flight surgeon and found &quot;unfit to fly&quot;. &quot;Unfit&quot; would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be mad to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must &quot;request&quot; the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared &quot;unfit&quot;.

The &quot;Catch-22&quot; is that &quot;anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn&#x27;t really crazy&quot;. Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation &quot;are&quot; sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.

Therefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.

A logical formulation of this situation is:
The philosopher Laurence Goldstein argues that the &quot;airman&#x27;s dilemma&quot; is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a &quot;vacuous biconditional&quot; that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:

<text>Elizabeth Langley (née Cass; 1863–1956) was an English seamstress and dress designer whose mistaken arrest for prostitution in 1887 became a minor cause célèbre.

==Early life==
Cass was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and grew up in Stockton-on-Tees. After working as a seamstress, she moved to London to be a dress designer early in 1887. She was employed by Mrs Mary Ann Bowman, and lived on her premises at 19 Southampton Row.

==Mistaken arrest==
On 28 June 1887 Cass went out in the late evening to do some shopping at Jay&#x27;s Shop at 243–253 Regent Street (a respected retailer of silk and millinery, holding a Royal Warrant). The week had seen Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, and London was thronged with people enjoying a month of record sunshine.

Jay&#x27;s was closed, and the pavement was full of people. As she pushed her way through the crowd on Oxford Street to go home, she was suddenly arrested by PC DR 42 Endacott, of Tottenham Court Road Police Station. She was taken to the police station and charged with solicitation and prostitution, and the next morning she appeared at Great Marlborough Street Police Court before Robert Milnes Newton, one of two Stipendiary Magistrates. PC Endacott gave evidence of the arrest and testified that he had seen her three times before in Regent Street late at night soliciting for prostitution.

Cass&#x27;s employer, Mrs Bowman, was called in her defence and testified that she had been in London only a few months, and had never before been out late at night. Further, she was a respectable woman of perfect character in a good job. Bowman was unshakeable in her evidence, giving the magistrate no option but to find Cass not guilty. But he added the following warning:

The clear implication is that the magistrate believed Cass to be guilty, but had persuaded Bowman to perjure herself to secure her acquittal.

On 30 June Bowman wrote to the Metropolitan Police headquarters to complain about the police&#x27;s action in the case. The day after, Llewellyn Atherley-Jones, Liberal MP for North-Western Durham, first raised the case in Parliament. Atherley-Jones, a barrister by profession, took up Cass&#x27;s case and on 5 July he asked the Home Secretary Henry Matthews to order an inquiry. Matthews, noting that no conviction resulted, gave what seemed to Atherley-Jones to be a flippant answer and Atherley-Jones then decided he would seek to raise the matter on the adjournment. He managed to defeat the government by five votes.

The Home Secretary then ordered the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, Sir Charles Warren, to undertake an inquiry. PC Endacott was suspended on 6 July and the Lord Chancellor began an inquiry into the conduct of Mr. Newton. The Metropolitan Police inquiry opened on 11 July and after six days of hearings concluded on 26 July. The report did not make any findings as to whether the arrest was justified (calling for the evidence to be tested in a court under oath), but Sir Charles Warren concluded &quot;I am not prepared to say that I can see any grounds for accusing PC Endacott of wilful perjury. However, that is a matter on which I think the Public Prosecutors should decide&quot;.

Bowman and Cass had already begun a private prosecution of PC Endacott for perjury, and after due consideration the Law Officers wrote to their solicitors offering to take over the case, or permitting the case to go ahead under their direction. They chose the second option. Colleagues within the Metropolitan Police raised a subscription to pay for Endacott&#x27;s defence. Meanwhile, the informal inquiry into the magistrate had concluded in secret, with the decision to give Newton a formal reprimand. Newton had relied for justification of his warning to Cass on a statute that allowed a magistrate to issue such a warning to a defendant who had been found guilty but whom the magistrate felt was undeserving of any sentence, and the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s letter highlighted this as a mistake in law.

==Perjury case==
The Grand Jury found a true bill against PC Endacott for perjury on 13 September but the trial was postponed to the Michaelmas Term, eventually beginning on 31 October. On 1 November, Cass (now Mrs Langley) was called to give evidence; afterwards Mr. Justice Stephen heard a submission (in the absence of the jury) from the prosecution and ruled that the case was confined to whether PC Endacott committed perjury in saying that he had seen Cass three times before in Regent Street. The judge further said that in his own view, there was no evidence that Endacott had been wilfully mis-stating the truth: the most likely explanation was that he had been making an honest mistake. The Solicitor-General accepted that view and withdrew the prosecution.

Mrs Langley and her defenders were not pleased by this outcome. The inquiry and the trial had given the opportunity to PC Endacott&#x27;s legal representatives to make further assaults on her character, and Llewellyn Atherley-Jones insisted his original objection had been to the actions of the magistrate.

<doc id="1172080" wikidata="Q26033" url="?curid=1172080" title="Homosexual clergy in the Catholic Church">
<text>The canon law of the Roman Catholic Church requires that clerics &quot;observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven&quot;; for this reason, priests in Roman Catholic dioceses make vows of celibacy at their ordination, thereby agreeing to remain unmarried and abstinent throughout their lives. However, as well as this vow of celibacy, the 1961 document entitled &quot;Careful Selection and Training of Candidates for the States of Perfection and Sacred Orders&quot; states further that homosexual men should not be ordained at all.

In 2005, the Church clarified that men with &quot;deeply rooted homosexual tendencies&quot; could not be ordained; the Vatican followed up in 2008 with a directive to implement psychological screening for candidates for the priesthood. Conditions listed for exclusion from the priesthood include &quot;uncertain sexual identity&quot; and &quot;deep-seated homosexual tendencies&quot;.

Despite church teachings, many Catholic clergy either identify as gay or have sex with other men.

==Church directives==

===&quot;Careful Selection and Training of Candidates&quot; (1961)===
The 1961 document entitled &quot;Careful Selection and Training of Candidates for the States of Perfection and Sacred Orders&quot; stated that homosexual men should not be ordained.

===&quot;Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations&quot; (2005)===
In November 2005, the Vatican completed an &quot;Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders&quot;. Publication was made through the Congregation for Catholic Education. According to the new policy, men with &quot;transitory&quot; homosexual leanings may be ordained deacons following three years of prayer and chastity. However, men with &quot;deeply rooted homosexual tendencies&quot; or who are sexually active cannot be ordained. No new moral teaching was contained in the instruction: the instruction proposed by the document was rather towards enhancing vigilance in barring gay men from seminaries, and from the priesthood. As the title of the document indicates, it concerned exclusively candidates with homosexual tendencies, and not other candidates.

While the preparation for this document had started 10 years before its publication, this instruction has been seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to several sex scandals involving priests in the late 20th/early 21st century, including the American Roman Catholic sex abuse cases and a 2004 sex scandal in a seminary at St. Pölten (Austria). 

The document has attracted criticism based on an interpretation that the document implies that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia or with sexual abuse more generally. There have been some questions on how distinctions between deep-seated and transient homosexuality, as proposed by the document, would be applied in practice: the actual distinction that is made might be between those who abuse and those who do not.

Two months before his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II, troubled by the sex scandals in the US, Austria, and Ireland, had written to the Congregation for Catholic Education: &quot;Right from the moment young men enter a Seminary their ability to live a life of celibacy should be monitored so that before their ordination one should be morally certain of their sexual and emotional maturity.&quot; 

===Implementation===
The Belgian college of bishops elaborated that the sexual restrictions for seminary and priesthood candidates apply equally to men of all sexual orientations. The Vatican followed up in 2008 with a directive to implement psychological screening for candidates for the priesthood. Conditions listed for exclusion from the priesthood include &quot;uncertain sexual identity&quot; and &quot;deep-seated homosexual tendencies&quot;.

Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York has been quoted as saying that the Vatican&#x27;s directive was not simply a &quot;no-gays&quot; policy.

==Opposition to gay clergy==
Over recent years Catholics on the religious right have tried to connect the incidence of homosexuality within the priesthood to the sexual abuse scandal facing the Church arguing, according to gay social critic Andrew Sullivan, that the direct root &quot;was not abuse of power, or pedophilia, or clericalism, or the distortive psychological effects of celibacy and institutional homophobia, but gayness itself.&quot;

Cardinal Raymond Burke has called for the Church to be &quot;purified&quot; of its &quot;homosexual culture&quot;. Bishop Robert Morlino of Wisconsin has suggested a &quot;homosexual subculture&quot; was wreaking devastation and the Church therefore needed to show &quot;more hatred of homosexual sexual behavior&quot;. Michael Hichborn of the Lepanto Institute has suggested removing all gay clergy from the church, even though this might cause a shortage of priests.

==Estimating numbers==

===Historical incidence of homosexual clergy===

In Adomnan of Iona&#x27;s biography of Columba there is an anecdotal story about two priests with a strong attachment to one another &quot;in a carnal way&quot;. One was Findchan, described as the founder of the monastery of &quot;Scotic Artchain&quot; in Tiree. The other priest was Aed Dub.

Peter Damian, in the 11th century, wrote a book called the about homosexuality among the clergy in his own time period. He harshly condemned homosexual practice among the clergy.

In 1102, Anselm of Canterbury demanded that the punishment for homosexuality should be moderate because &quot;this sin has been so public that hardly anyone has blushed for it, and many therefore have plunged into it without realising its gravity&quot;. It is argued that probably only in the 12th and 13th centuries that a mass condemnation of homosexuality began in Europe. This condemnation moderated considerably in the final decade of the twentieth century with the distinction now made by Catholic church authorities between homosexual orientation and homosexual activity—forbidding the latter while regarding the former as intrinsically disordered but not sinful in and of itself.

===Inside the Vatican===

Pope Francis has directly faced questions from journalists about whether a &quot;gay lobby&quot; effectively operates within the Vatican itself, and investigative journalists have caught several high-ranking Vatican clerics engaging in homosexual sexual activity or relationships.

In October 2015, on the day before the second round of the Synod on the Family, a senior Polish priest working in the Vatican, Krzysztof Charamsa, stated publicly in Italy&#x27;s newspaper that he was gay and had a long-term partner. By doing so he had intended to draw attention to the Church&#x27;s current attitude towards gay Catholics which he felt was regressive and damaging. In his resignation letter he thanked Pope Francis for some of his words and gestures towards the gay community; however, he also strongly criticized the institution of the Catholic Church for being &quot;frequently violently homophobic&quot; and &quot;insensitive, unfair and brutal&quot; towards people that are gay, noting the irony that he felt there were significant numbers of gay men active at all levels within the Church (including the cardinalate). He called for all statements from the Holy See that are offensive and violent against gay people to be withdrawn, citing Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s signature of the 2005 document that forbids men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies from becoming priests as particularly &quot;diabolical&quot;.

===United States===
Studies find it difficult to quantify specific percentages of Roman Catholic priests who have a homosexual orientation (either openly gay or closeted) in the United States. Nevertheless, several studies suggest that the incidence of homosexuality in the Roman Catholic priesthood is much higher than in the general population as a whole. While a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; survey of US priests find that 15% say they are completely or mostly homosexual, estimates of homosexual priests run as high as 50%.

Studies by James Wolf and by Richard Sipe from the early 1990s suggest that the percentage of priests in the Catholic Church who admitted to being gay or were in homosexual relationships was well above the national average for the country. Elizabeth Stuart, a former convener of the Catholic Caucus of the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement claimed, &quot;It has been estimated that at least 33 percent of all priests in the RC Church in the United States are homosexual.&quot;

The John Jay Report published in 2004 suggested that &quot;homosexual men entered the seminaries in noticeable numbers from the late 1970s through the 1980s&quot;.

Another report suggested that from the mid-1980s onwards, Catholic priests in the US were dying from AIDS-related illnesses at a rate four times higher than that of the general population, with most of the cases contracted through gay sex, and the cause often concealed on their death certificates. A follow-up study the next year by the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; found the AIDS-related death rate among priests was &quot;more than six times&quot; the rate among the general population in the 14 states studied. The report gained widespread coverage in the media, but the study was criticized as being unrepresentative and having &quot;little, if any, real value&quot;. Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of Detroit, has suggested that this was because, &quot;Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn&#x27;t know how to handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would handle it in ways that were not healthy.&quot; Additionally, the report suggested that some priests and behavioral experts believed the Church had &quot;scared priests into silence by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the breaking of celibacy vows as shameful&quot;. Gumbleton has gone on to argue that the Church should openly ordain gay men.

A 2002 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; nationwide poll of 1,854 priests (responding) reported that: 
* 9% of priests identified themselves as gay, and 
* 6% identified themselves as &quot;somewhere in between but more on the homosexual side&quot;. 
Asked if a &quot;homosexual subculture&quot; (defined as a &quot;definite group of persons that has its own friendships, social gatherings and vocabulary&quot;) existed in their diocese or religious order: 
* 17% of the priests said &quot;definitely&quot;, and 
* 27% said &quot;probably&quot;; 
* 53% of the priests who were ordained in the years 1982–2002 affirmed such a subculture existed in the seminary when they attended. 
Shortly after the poll was published, the Vatican ordered an Apostolic visitor to examine American seminaries. The visitation began in 2005, and the final report issued in 2008. The report spoke about &quot;difficulties in the area of morality[...] Usually, but not exclusively, this meant homosexual behavior.&quot; Steps were subsequently taken to deal with the issue, including correcting a &quot;laxity of discipline&quot;.

=== Germany ===
In 2021 and 2022 several Roman Catholic priests outed themselves in action OutInChurch.

===Italy===
In March 2018 Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, Archbishop of Naples, submitted a 1,200-page dossier to the Vatican that sought to identify 40 actively gay Catholic priests and seminarians across the country, after the list was compiled by a male escort called Francesco Mangiacapra.

==Homosexuality and the episcopacy==
A number of senior members of the clergy have been alleged to have engaged in homosexual activity: 
* Archbishop Rembert Weakland, who retired in 2002, was alleged to have been in a relationship with a former graduate student; 
* Juan Carlos Maccarone, the Bishop of Santiago del Estero in Argentina, retired in 2005 after video surfaced showing him engaged in homosexual acts; 
* Francisco Domingo Barbosa Da Silveira, the Bishop of Minas in Uruguay, resigned in 2009 after it was alleged that he had broken his vow of celibacy.

==Religious orders==
The General Chapter of the Dominican Order held in Caleruega in 1995 &quot;affirmed that the same demands of chastity apply to all brethren of whatever sexual orientation, and so no one can be excluded on this ground.&quot;

In February 2006, the president of the Religious Conference of Spain, Alejandro Fernández Barrajón declared that &quot;[sexual and affective] maturity is what must be insisted on, when selecting candidates for priesthood or religious life. Conditioning persons on their sexual orientation is not evangelical. Jesus would not do so.&quot;

As stated in the Acts of the General Chapter of Diffinitors of the Order of Friars Preachers meeting, the text read &quot;as a radical demand, the vow of chastity is equally binding on homosexuals and heterosexuals. Hence, no sexual orientation is a priori incompatible with the call to chastity and the fraternal life.&quot;

This series of meetings were conducted from July 17th to August 8th in 1995 in Caleruega, Spain. Radcliffe indicated that it really did not matter what sexual orientation a person has, but warned against potential division that could arise if sub-groups based on sexual orientation threaten unity and make it more difficult to practice chastity.

<text>The Climatron is a greenhouse enclosed in a geodesic dome that is part of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. Initiated by then Garden director Frits W. Went, the dome is the world&#x27;s first completely air-conditioned greenhouse and the first geodesic dome to be enclosed in rigid Plexiglass (Perspex) panels. Completed in 1960, it was designed by T. C. Howard, of Synergetics, Inc., Raleigh, North Carolina. The broad climatic range within the dome, which recreates a lowland rain forest, is achieved by sophisticated climate controls without using interior partitions.

The structure is an unpartitioned half-sphere dome, 42 m in diameter and 21 m high. The frame is supported by aluminum tubes under compression and aluminum rods under tension. The St. Louis architects Murphy and Mackey were the architects on record. Synergetics, Inc were the designers of the dome. The architects received the 1961 R. S. Reynolds Memorial Award of $25,000 for their architectural use of aluminum. In 1976 it was named one of the 100 most significant architectural achievements in United States history.

The dome contains a small stone pre-existing neo-classical pavilion and over 400 varieties of plant life. A bank of 24 flood lights, revolving at night in five-minute cycles, simulates noon light on one side of the dome and moonlight on other side. The climate ranges from the Amazon through Hawaii and Java to India.

Over time, the building experienced deterioration of the original Plexiglas panels and the adverse effect of humidity on some metal elements. The greenhouse was closed for extensive renovations in 1988 and reopened in March 1990. The original Plexiglas glazing was replaced with 2,425 panes of heat-strengthened glass (containing a plastic interlayer called Saflex) and coated with a low-emissivity film. In 2010, the Botanical Garden celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Climatron.

<text>Font rasterization is the process of converting text from a vector description (as found in scalable fonts such as TrueType fonts) to a raster or bitmap description. This often involves some anti-aliasing on screen text to make it smoother and easier to read. It may also involve hinting—information embedded in the font data that optimizes rendering details for particular character sizes.

== Types of rasterization ==
The simplest form of rasterization is simple line-drawing with no anti-aliasing of any kind. In Microsoft&#x27;s terminology, this is called &quot;bi-level&quot; (and more popularly &quot;black and white&quot;) rendering because no intermediate shades (of gray) are used to draw the glyphs. (In fact, any two colors can be used as foreground and background.) This form of rendering is also called aliased or &quot;jagged&quot;. This is the fastest rendering method in the sense that it requires the least computational effort. However, it has the disadvantage that rendered glyphs may lose definition and become hard to recognize at small sizes. Therefore, many font data files (such as TrueType) contain hints that help the rasterizer decide where to render pixels for particularly troublesome areas in the glyphs, or sets of hand-tweaked bitmaps to use at specific pixel sizes. As a prototypical example, all versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows 95 (e.g. Windows 3.1) only provided this type of built-in rasterizer.
A more complicated approach is to use standard anti-aliasing techniques from computer graphics. This can be thought of as determining, for each pixel at the edges of the character, how much of that pixel the character occupies, and drawing that pixel with that degree of opacity. For example, when drawing a black (000000) letter on a white (FFFFFF) background, if a pixel ideally should be half filled (perhaps by a diagonal line from corner to corner) it is drawn 50% gray (BCBCBC). Over-simple application of this procedure can produce blurry glyphs. For example, if the letter includes a vertical line that should be one pixel wide but falls exactly between two pixels, it appears on screen as a two-pixel-wide gray line. This blurriness trades clarity for accuracy. However, modern systems often force lines to fall within integral pixel coordinates, which makes glyphs look sharper, but also makes lines slightly wider or thinner than they would have looked on a printed sheet of paper.

Most computer displays have pixels made up of multiple subpixels (typically one each for red, green, and blue, which are combined to produce the full range of colours). In some cases, particularly with flat panel displays, it is possible to exploit this by rendering at the subpixel resolution rather than using whole pixels, which can increase the effective resolution of the screen. This is generally known as subpixel rendering. One proprietary implementation of subpixel rendering is Microsoft&#x27;s ClearType.

== Currently used rasterization systems ==
In modern operating systems, rasterization is normally provided by a shared library common to many applications. Such a shared library may be built into the operating system or the desktop environment, or may be added later. In principle, each application may use a different font rasterization library, but in practice most systems attempt to standardize on a single library.

Microsoft Windows has supported subpixel rendering since Windows XP. On the other hand, the standard Microsoft rasterizer without ClearType is an example of one that prioritizes type designer&#x27;s intent of clarity; by forcing text into integral coordinate positions, following the type designer&#x27;s intent of hinting, and even not antialiasing certain fonts at certain sizes, following the type designer&#x27;s intent of the gasp table, it becomes easier to read on the screen, but may appear somewhat different when printed. This has changed with Direct2D/DirectWrite shipping on Windows 7 and Windows Vista platform update, allowing subpixel text positioning to 1/16 pixel sizes.

Mac OS X&#x27;s Quartz is distinguished by the use of subpixel positioning; it does not force glyphs into exact pixel locations, instead using various antialiasing techniques, including subpixel rendering, to position characters and lines to appear further from the type designer&#x27;s intent of hinting and closer to the original outline. The result is that the on-screen display looks extremely similar to printed output, but can occasionally be difficult to read at smaller point sizes. The Quartz renderer has, since macOS Mojave, removed subpixel rendering, relying purely on greyscale anti-aliasing instead. This change is acceptable to HiDPI &quot;retina&quot; screens, but makes text on external monitors harder to read.

Most other systems use the FreeType library, which depending on the settings, can fall anywhere between Microsoft&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s implementations; it supports hinting and anti-aliasing, and optionally performs subpixel rendering and positioning. FreeType also offers some features not present in either implementation such as color-balanced subpixel rendering and gamma correction.

Applications may also bring their own font rendering solutions. Graphics frameworks like Skia Graphics Engine (used by Google Chrome) occasionally use their own font renderer. Video games and other 3D applications may also need faster, GPU-based renderers such as various SDF-based renderers and &quot;Slug&quot;.

<text>System Settings (known as System Preferences prior to macOS Ventura) is an application included with macOS. It allows users to modify various system settings, which are divided into separate Preference Panes. The System Settings application was introduced in the first version of Mac OS X to replace the control panels found in earlier versions of the Mac operating system.

== History ==
=== Control Panels (Classic Mac OS) ===
Before the release of Mac OS X in 2001, users modified system settings using control panels. Control panels, like the preference panes found in System Preferences, were separate resources (cdevs) that were accessed through the Apple menu&#x27;s Control Panel.

A rudimentary form of system preferences dates back to 1983 with the Apple Lisa Preferences menu item. This included a subset of configurable settings called &quot;convenience settings&quot; as well as other settings that adapted according to the programs and devices installed on the Lisa Office System. The original control panels in the earliest versions of the classic Mac OS were all combined into one small Desk Accessory. Susan Kare designed the interface for the original control panel, and tried to make it as user-friendly as possible. This design was used until System 3 when separate control panel files (&quot;cdev&quot;s) were added, accessible solely through the control panel.

With the debut of System 7 the control panels were separated into individual small application-like processes accessible from the Finder, and by a sub-menu in the Apple menu provided by Apple Menu Options. Mac OS 9, the last release of the Mac OS before Mac OS X, included 32 control panels. By Mac OS 9, many control panels had been rewritten as true applications.

The control panels included with Mac OS 9 are:

* Appearance
* Apple Menu Options
* AppleTalk
* ColorSync
* Control Strip
* Date &amp; Time
* DialAssist
* Energy Saver
* Extensions Manager
* File Exchange
* File Sharing
* File Synchronization
* General Controls
* Internet
* Keyboard
* Keychain Access
* Launcher
* Location Manager
* Memory
* Modem
* Monitors
* Mouse
* Multiple Users
* Numbers
* QuickTime Settings
* Remote Access
* Software Update
* Sound
* Speech
* Startup Disk
* TCP/IP
* Text
* Web Sharing
=== System Preferences (Mac OS X) ===
When Mac OS X was released, preference panes replaced control panels. Preference panes are not applications but loadable bundles for the System Preferences application, similar to the arrangement used under System 6. By default, System Preferences organizes preference panes into several categories. As of Mac OS X v10.7, these categories are &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Hardware&quot;, &quot;Internet &amp; Wireless&quot;, and &quot;System&quot;. A fifth category, &quot;Other&quot;, appears when third-party preference panes are installed. Users can also choose to sort preference panes alphabetically. System Preferences originally included a customizable toolbar into which frequently-used preference pane icons could be dragged, but this was removed in Mac OS X v10.4 and replaced with a static toolbar that featured back and forward navigation buttons and a search field.

Apple has added new preference panes when major features are added to the operating system and occasionally merges multiple panes into one. When Exposé was introduced with Mac OS X v10.3, a corresponding preference pane was added to System Preferences. This was replaced by a single &quot;Dashboard &amp; Exposé&quot; pane in Mac OS X v10.4, which introduced Dashboard. When the .Mac service was replaced by MobileMe, the corresponding preference pane was also renamed.

In OS X Mountain Lion, the &quot;Universal Access&quot; pane is changed to &quot;Accessibility&quot; and &quot;Speech&quot; is changed to &quot;Dictation &amp; Speech&quot;.

In OS X Yosemite, the user interface was redesigned to be in standard with other system applications,
being less detailed and more minimalist than in prior versions.

=== System Settings (macOS Ventura) ===
In macOS Ventura, System Preferences was renamed to System Settings. In addition to a new side bar that contains all preference panes on a sidebar to the left of the window, and most icons are squared, minimalist, and smaller, instead of the original big, more detailed, varied preference panes that were used in prior versions. Because of this nature, they can no longer be organized, but can in turn now be searched and organized alphabetically. This design looks somewhat similar to that of the Windows 11&#x27;s Settings (which has also added a persistent navigation sidebar.) and the IPadOS version of the Settings app. If AirPods are connected, a menu for the AirPods will appear at the top of System Settings.

== Preference Panes ==
In System Preferences, preferences are organized by theme into Preference Panes (abbreviated prefpane), which are special dynamically loaded plugins. Introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, the purpose of a Preference Pane is to allow the user to set preferences for a specific application or the system by means of a graphical user interface. Preference Panes are the macOS replacement for control panels in the classic Mac OS. Prior to Mac OS X v10.4, collections of Preference Panes featured a &quot;Show All&quot; button to show all the panes in the collection and a customizable toolbar to which frequently-used preference panes could be dragged. In Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the currently-active pane would also be highlighted in the toolbar when it was selected. With Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, the toolbar was removed in favor of a plain Show All button and back/forward history arrows. With the release of MacOS Ventura, they were resigned to look like the ones used in iOS.
