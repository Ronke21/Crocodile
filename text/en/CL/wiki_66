<text>Franklin Resources, Inc. is an American multinational holding company that, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as Franklin Templeton; it is a global investment firm founded in New York City in 1947 as Franklin Distributors, Inc. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BEN, in honor of Benjamin Franklin, for whom the company is named, and who was admired by founder Rupert Johnson Sr. In 1973, the company&#x27;s headquarters moved from New York to San Mateo, California.

==History==

The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. (Harris) Johnson Sr. (1900–1989), who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street. He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing. The company&#x27;s first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.

After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. At that time, the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million. Rupert Johnson Jr., Charlie&#x27;s brother, joined the company in 1965.

Franklin went public in 1971. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield &amp; Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin&#x27;s offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin&#x27;s first billion-dollar fund and launched the company&#x27;s significant asset growth in the 1980s.

Starting in 1980, the company&#x27;s total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company&#x27;s stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin&#x27;s income and bond funds).

In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.

In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.

Fiduciary Trust Company International, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in 2 World Trade Center at the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001. 87 employees died in the collapse.

The firm has specialized expertise across a full range of asset classes. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names, among others. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.

In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies. The same month, &quot;USA Today&quot; listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982. As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide. In February 2009, &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot; called Franklin Templeton &quot;King of the Decade&quot; among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.

In 2013, Charles Johnson retired as chairman and his son Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.

In 2019, the firm acquired Benefit Street Partners, an alternative credit investment group.

In 2020, Jenny Johnson became CEO and President of the firm and Greg Johnson became Executive chairman.

In July 2020, Franklin Templeton acquired Legg Mason, Inc. and its multiple specialist investment managers, establishing Franklin Templeton as one of the world&#x27;s largest independent, specialized global investment managers with a combined $1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM) across one of the broadest ranges of high-quality investment teams in the industry. The combined footprint significantly deepens Franklin Templeton&#x27;s presence in key geographies and creates an expansive investment platform that is well balanced between institutional and retail client AUM.

In November 2021, Franklin Templeton announced its acquisition of Lexington Partners in a $1.75billion cash deal. The acquisition completed in April 2022.

In January 2022, Franklin Templeton acquired O&#x27;Shaughnessy Asset Management, an asset management firm founded by James O&#x27;Shaughnessy.

On May 31, 2022, it was announced that BNY Mellon Investment Management would sell Alcentra to Franklin Templeton. The transaction was completed on November 1, 2022.

On May 31, 2023, Great-West Lifeco announced that Franklin Templeton would acquire Putnam Investments for $925 million. Putnam Investments subsidiary, PanAgora Asset Management would not be included in the acquisition. The deal was completed in January 2024.

In August 2023, Bloomberg News reported that Franklin Templeton executives in China were mandated to attend courses on Xi Jinping Thought.

==Mutual funds and ETFs==
Franklin Templeton has 455 open-ended mutual funds and seven closed-end funds. Included in these are 27 state and federal tax-free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.

Prominent funds include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund.

The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX) is a mutual fund in Morningstar&#x27;s &quot;conservative allocation&quot; category and &quot;large/value&quot; style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).

Franklin Templeton launched its first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2013. By 2021, these included 55 active, smart beta/multifactor and passively managed ETFs in the U.S, with US$9.7 billion in assets under management.

In 2021, Franklin Templeton launched the first &quot;tokenised&quot; US mutual fund as a pilotit uses a blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. The technology is provided by the Stellar network and Blockchain Administrator, a Delaware company. The OnChain US Government Money Fund pilot started with $1.4M of seed money and investment from employees. The automated administration can trade around the clock and removes the need for brokerages, which should result in a &quot;highly significant decrease in fees&quot;. However, the fund actually has a high level of costs because of its small size and the fact that, as a pilot, it is maintaining traditional records in parallel.

<text>Valvestino (Brescian: ) is a in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy in northern Italy.

==Historical and cultural profile==
The Stoni (or Stoeni) people and the Gallic Cenomani, then the Romans and the Lombards settled the area. The Lodrone family were the lords of Valvestino from 1200 to 1807. The valley was―officially―absorbed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the mid-19th century but for many years operated, in effect, as an autonomous region without external oversight, owing to its relative geographic isolation in the mountains. It came to Italy in 1919. Valvestino was separated administratively from Trentino in 1934, becoming a of five (municipal subdivisions): Armo, Bollone, Moerna, Persone and . The ancient administrative autonomy restored to Valvestino in 1947.

The abundance of pastures has always been significant for the village economy, dedicated to cattle raising that survives to the present, in summer mountain barns, with production of milk, from which famous cheeses and butter are obtained. Historically, the cores of the hamlets of Armo, Bollone, Moerna, Persone and Turano are crossings of small passages between peasants&#x27; high and narrow houses.

==Festival and events==
* In August, Armo has the Feast of the Alpini (Alpine troops)
* A local variation of the traditional religious festival, (&#x27;Feast of Forgiveness&#x27;) is held in Turano on the last Sunday of August each year. It commemorates the sojourn of the exiled Pope Alexander III, who in gratitude for the villagers&#x27; hospitality issued a Papal indulgence, for remission of sins, to the valley&#x27;s inhabitiants. This tradition, although dating to at least the 15th century, is likely apocryphal.

In both domains London Streets leads on most byelaws and prosecution mechanisms and stance for offences that impact traffic and safety directly. In civil law it is among local authorities that should monitor costs, co-ordinate, recover costs and ensure reinstatement by contractors and statutory undertakers under the NRSWA 1991.

London Streets also acts as a London highways authority basic advisor and in particular issues and refers to its influential Streetscape Guidance, standards for roads and streets to make London&#x27;s roads safer and more efficient.

==Other highways==
Motorways within London are the responsibility of National Highways. 

The rest of the streets are the responsibility of the London boroughs – or natural person or corporate owners predominantly in the case of the tiny percentage of roads that are private roads, and over which the law provides for shared responsibilities with users in the case of public rights of way.

==Period of own logo==

From 2007 London Streets used a blue and grey variant of the Transport for London roundel hosting the &quot;Streets&quot; name. This was withdrawn in 2014.

<text>Hidalgo is a station on Line 2 and Line 3 of the Mexico City Metro system. It is located in the Cuauhtémoc borough of Mexico City, west of the city center, on Hidalgo Avenue and serves the Colonia Tabacalera, Colonia Guerrero, and Colonia Centro districts.

==General information==
Metro Hidalgo&#x27;s name and logo evoke Miguel Hidalgo, the chief instigator of the Mexican War of Independence of 1810, after whom the nearby avenue is named. The station&#x27;s icon depicts the profile of Hidalgo.

Metro Hidalgo was opened along Line 2 on 14 September 1970. Service along Line 3 started on 20 November 1970.

The station also connects with trolleybus Line &quot;LL&quot;, which runs between this metro station and the Colonia San Felipe de Jesús district. The station has an information desk, facilities for the handicapped, and a cultural display.

The station is also close to Paseo de la Reforma, an important avenue that crosses downtown Mexico City and leads to Chapultepec Park. Some of the station exits are located on the west end of the Alameda Central, a large ornamental park. On the east end of the Alameda stands the Palacio de Bellas Artes. On the west end, near Metro Hidalgo, is the Museo Mural Diego Rivera.

The nearby shrine to Saint Jude becomes a place of pilgrimage the 28th of each month.

<text>In geometry, the elongated triangular pyramid is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a tetrahedron by attaching a triangular prism to its base. Like any elongated pyramid, the resulting solid is topologically (but not geometrically) self-dual.

== Construction ==
The elongated triangular pyramid is constructed from a triangular prism by attaching regular tetrahedron onto one of its bases, a process known as elongation. The tetrahedron covers an equilateral triangle, replacing it with three other equilateral triangles, so that the resulting polyhedron has four equilateral triangles and three squares as its faces. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is called the Johnson solid, and the elongated triangular pyramid is among them, enumerated as the seventh Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
An elongated triangular pyramid with edge length formula_2 has a height, by adding the height of a regular tetrahedron and a triangular prism:
formula_3
Its surface area can be calculated by adding the area of all eight equilateral triangles and three squares:
formula_4
and its volume can be calculated by slicing it into a regular tetrahedron and a prism, adding their volume up::
formula_5

It has the three-dimensional symmetry group, the cyclic group formula_6 of order 6. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of the tetrahedron and the triangular prism:
* the dihedral angle of a tetrahedron between two adjacent triangular faces is formula_7;
* the dihedral angle of the triangular prism between the square to its bases is formula_8, and the dihedral angle between square-to-triangle, on the edge where tetrahedron and triangular prism are attached, is formula_9;
* the dihedral angle of the triangular prism between two adjacent square faces is the internal angle of an equilateral triangle formula_10.

<text>In geometry, the elongated square pyramid is a convex polyhedron constructed from a cube by attaching an equilateral square pyramid onto one of its faces. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated square bipyramid is a composite, since it can constructed by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto the faces of a cube that are opposite each other, a process known as elongation. This construction involves the removal of those two squares and replacing them with those pyramids, resulting in eight equilateral triangles and four squares as their faces. A convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are regular is a Johnson solid, and the elongated square bipyramid is one of them, denoted as formula_1, the fifteenth Johnson solid.

== Properties ==
Given that formula_2 is the edge length of an elongated square pyramid. The height of an elongated square pyramid can be calculated by adding the height of an equilateral square pyramid and a cube. The height of a cube is the same as the edge length of a cube&#x27;s side, and the height of an equilateral square pyramid is formula_3. Therefore, the height of an elongated square bipyramid is:
formula_4
Its surface area can be calculated by adding all the area of four equilateral triangles and four squares:
formula_5
Its volume is obtained by slicing it into an equilateral square pyramid and a cube, and then adding them:
formula_6
The elongated square pyramid has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the equilateral square pyramid, the cyclic group formula_7 of order eight. Its dihedral angle can be obtained by adding the angle of an equilateral square pyramid and a cube:
* The dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between two adjacent triangles is the dihedral angle of an equilateral triangle between its lateral faces, formula_8,
* The dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between two adjacent squares is the dihedral angle of a cube between those, formula_9,
* The dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between square and triangle is formula_10. Therefore, the dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between triangle-to-square, on the edge where the equilateral square pyramids attach the cube, is formula_11

<doc id="1177947" wikidata="Q5967156" url="?curid=1177947" title="I'm with Busey">
<text>I&#x27;m with Busey is a mockumentary television show which aired on Comedy Central in mid 2003. It revolved around a young writer named Adam de la Peña, who met and befriended his childhood idol, actor Gary Busey.

The show has only one season, and the popularity of the show was limited, It has developed a cult following in the years after its cancellation.

==Format==
The show focuses on Gary Busey teaching Adam de la Peña about life. In one episode, for example, de la Peña complained to Busey about his lack of a love life. Busey helped him become more confident by setting him up with a date and then feeding him lines through an earpiece. Busey told him to tell the girl that he had &quot;a Loch Ness monster in his pants&quot;.

Much of the humor revolves around Busey-isms, short statements about the world. For example: &quot;Fear is the dark room where the devil develops his negatives.&quot; After such a phrase, the camera cuts to de la Peña&#x27;s confused reaction, or to one of his short, confessional-style monologues. Many of these Busey-isms were later repeated during Busey&#x27;s appearances on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;.

The show appears as real as possible. However, it was later revealed that much of the show was improvisation. Busey and de la Peña agreed on a scene&#x27;s contents, and then improvised their lines.

==Episodes==
Each episode has a topic of Adam&#x27;s or Gary&#x27;s choosing.

==Reception==
Variety&#x27;s Phil Gallo described &quot;I&#x27;m with Busey&quot; ”as low grade as television will allow.”

<text>In geometry, the elongated triangular [[bipyramid]] (or dipyramid) or triakis triangular prism a polyhedron constructed from a triangular prism by attaching two tetrahedrons to its bases. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated triangular bipyramid is constructed from a triangular prism by attaching two tetrahedrons onto its bases, a process known as the elongation. These tetrahedrons cover the triangular faces so that the resulting polyhedron has nine faces (six of them are equilateral triangles and three of them are squares), fifteen edges, and eight vertices. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The elongated bipyramid is one of them, enumerated as the fourteenth Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==

The surface area of an elongated triangular bipyramid formula_2 is the sum of all polygonal face&#x27;s area: six equilateral triangles and three squares. The volume of an elongated triangular bipyramid formula_3 can be ascertained by slicing it off into two tetrahedrons and a regular triangular prism and then adding their volume. The height of an elongated triangular bipyramid formula_4 is the sum of two tetrahedrons and a regular triangular prism&#x27; height. Therefore, given the edge length formula_5, its surface area and volume is formulated as:
formula_6

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the triangular prism, the dihedral group formula_7 of order twelve. The dihedral angle of an elongated triangular bipyramid can be calculated by adding the angle of the tetrahedron and the triangular prism:
* the dihedral angle of a tetrahedron between two adjacent triangular faces is formula_8;
* the dihedral angle of the triangular prism between the square to its bases is formula_9, and the dihedral angle between square-to-triangle, on the edge where tetrahedron and triangular prism are attached, is formula_10;
* the dihedral angle of the triangular prism between two adjacent square faces is the internal angle of an equilateral triangle formula_11.

<text>Kraut juice (called Sauerkrautsaft in German, Zeamă de varză/Moare in Romanian, rasol, rasoj or rasuluk in the Balkans) is a beverage that consists of the liquid in which sauerkraut is cured. It is the juice of the vegetable itself and the pickling brine.

It is widely available in many central and eastern European countries, such as Germany, and in the parts of the Northeast and Midwest where German immigrants settled, such as central and western Pennsylvania.

It may be taken as a dietary supplement, as it is a source of vitamin C, B vitamins, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, potassium (475 mg), calcium, phosphorus, sulphur, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and lactic acid.

==Uses==
Kraut juice may be drunk alone or used as a component in mixed drinks.

It is one of the alternatives used in Romania to give the traditional soups ciorbă its sour taste.

<text>In geometry, the elongated square bipyramid (or elongated octahedron) is the polyhedron constructed by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto a cube&#x27;s faces that are opposite each other. It can also be seen as 4 lunes (squares with triangles on opposite sides) linked together with squares to squares and triangles to triangles. It is also been named the pencil cube or 12-faced pencil cube due to its shape.

A zircon crystal is an example of an elongated square bipyramid.

== Construction ==
The elongated square bipyramid is constructed by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto the faces of a cube that are opposite each other, a process known as elongation. This construction involves the removal of those two squares and replacing them with those pyramids, resulting in eight equilateral triangles and four squares as their faces.. A convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are regular is a Johnson solid, and the elongated square bipyramid is one of them, denoted as formula_1, the fifteenth Johnson solid.

== Properties ==
Given that formula_2 is the edge length of an elongated square bipyramid. The height of an elongated square pyramid can be calculated by adding the height of two equilateral square pyramids and a cube. The height of a cube is the same as the given edge length formula_2, and the height of an equilateral square pyramid is formula_4. Therefore, the height of an elongated square bipyramid is:
formula_5
Its surface area can be calculated by adding all the area of eight equilateral triangles and four squares:
formula_6
Its volume is obtained by slicing it into two equilateral square pyramids and a cube, and then adding them:
formula_7
Its dihedral angle can be obtained in a similar way as the elongated square pyramid, by adding the angle of square pyramids and a cube:
* The dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between two adjacent triangles is the dihedral angle of an equilateral triangle between its lateral faces, formula_8
* The dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between two adjacent squares is the dihedral angle of a cube between those, formula_9
* The dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between square and triangle is formula_10. Therefore, the dihedral angle of an elongated square bipyramid between triangle-to-square, on the edge where the equilateral square pyramids attach the cube, is formula_11
The elongated square bipyramid has the dihedral symmetry, the dihedral group formula_12 of order eight: it has an axis of symmetry passing through the apices of square pyramids and the center of a cube, and its appearance is symmetrical by reflecting across a horizontal plane.

== Related polyhedra and honeycombs ==
The elongated square bipyramid is dual to the square bifrustum, which has eight trapezoidals and two squares.

A special kind of elongated square bipyramid &quot;without&quot; all regular faces allows a self-tessellation of Euclidean space. The triangles of this elongated square bipyramid are &quot;not&quot; regular; they have edges in the ratio 2::.


It can be considered a transitional phase between the cubic and rhombic dodecahedral honeycombs. Here, the cells are colored white, red, and blue based on their orientation in space. The square pyramid &quot;caps&quot; have shortened isosceles triangle faces, with six of these pyramids meeting together to form a cube. The dual of this honeycomb is composed of two kinds of octahedra (regular octahedra and triangular antiprisms), formed by superimposing octahedra into the cuboctahedra of the rectified cubic honeycomb. Both honeycombs have a symmetry of formula_13.
Cross-sections of the honeycomb, through cell centers, produce a chamfered square tiling, with flattened horizontal and vertical hexagons, and squares on the perpendicular polyhedra.

With regular faces, the elongated square bipyramid can form a tessellation of space with tetrahedra and octahedra. (The octahedra can be further decomposed into square pyramids.) This honeycomb can be considered an elongated version of the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.

<text>In geometry, the elongated pentagonal bipyramid is a polyhedron constructed by attaching two pentagonal pyramids onto the base of a pentagonal prism. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated pentagonal bipyramid is constructed from a pentagonal prism by attaching two pentagonal pyramids onto its bases, a process called elongation. These pyramids cover the pentagonal faces so that the resulting polyhedron ten equilateral triangles and five squares. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The elongated pentagonal bipyramid is among them, enumerated as the sixteenth Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an elongated pentagonal bipyramid formula_2 is the sum of all polygonal faces&#x27; area: ten equilateral triangles, and five squares. Its volume formula_3 can be ascertained by dissecting it into two pentagonal pyramids and one regular pentagonal prism and then adding its volume. Given an elongated pentagonal bipyramid with edge length formula_4, they can be formulated as:
formula_5
It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the pentagonal prism, the dihedral group formula_6 of order 20. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of the pentagonal pyramid and pentagonal prism:
* the dihedral angle of an elongated pentagonal bipyramid between two adjacent triangular faces is that of a pentagonal pyramid between those, 138.19°.
* the dihedral angle of an elongated pentagonal bipyramid between two adjacent square faces is that of a regular pentagonal prism, the internal angle of a regular pentagon, 108°.
* the dihedral angle of an elongated pentagonal bipyramid between square-to-triangle is the sum of the dihedral angle of a pentagonal pyramid between triangle-to-pentagon with that of a pentagonal prism between square-to-pentagon, 37.38° + 90° = 127.38°.

The dual of the elongated square bipyramid is a pentagonal bifrustum.

<doc id="1177954" wikidata="Q16029310" url="?curid=1177954" title="John Earle (Australian politician)">
<text>John Earle (15 November 1865 – 6 February 1932) was an Australian politician who served as Premier of Tasmania from 1914 to 1916 and also for one week in October 1909. He later served as a Senator for Tasmania from 1917 to 1923. Prior to entering politics, he worked as a miner and prospector. He began his career in the Australian Labor Party (ALP), helping to establish a local branch of the party, and was Tasmania&#x27;s first ALP premier. However, he was expelled from the party during the 1916 split and joined the Nationalists, whom he represented in the Senate.

== Early life ==
Earle was born on 15 November 1865 in Bridgewater, Tasmania, the son of Ann Teresa (née McShane) and Charles Staples Earle. His mother and father were of Irish and Cornish descent respectively. Earle grew up on his father&#x27;s farm and attended the local state school. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed as a blacksmith at a foundry in Hobart. He attended engineering and science classes at the Hobart Technical School and also attended lectures at the Hobart Mechanics&#x27; Institute, as a result of which he developed an interest in politics. He was a member of the Hobart Debating Club and became acquainted with the colony&#x27;s attorney-general Andrew Inglis Clark.

After completing his apprenticeship, Earle worked on the mines at Mathinna, Zeehan and Corinna. In 1893 he was a miners&#x27; representative at a government conference in Hobart. He returned to Zeehan in 1898 and became prominent in the local community, serving on the Zeehan Municipal Council, on the local hospital board, and as president of the Gormanston branch of the Amalgamated Miners&#x27; Association. He was one of 28 men blacklisted by the manager of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company for being &quot;disloyal and treacherous&quot;.

In 1901, Earle chaired the conference which established the Workers&#x27; Political League (WPL), the predecessor of the modern Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch). He was elected as the organisation&#x27;s inaugural president in 1903.

== Political career ==

===State politics===
Earle was defeated by three votes in the Tasmanian House of Assembly seat of Waratah at the 1903 state election. He reprised his candidacy in 1906 and was successful, subsequently being elected as leader of the parliamentary party. Following electoral reform, Earle was elected to the multi-member seat of Franklin at the 1909 election. He served Leader of the Opposition until 20 October 1909, when he formed a minority government of one week. He was the first premier of Tasmania from the ALP.

In 1914, Earle and the ALP formed another minority government after the defeat of Albert Solomon&#x27;s government on a confidence motion. In addition to the premiership he also appointed himself attorney-general. In the House of Assembly the government relied on the vote of independent MP Joshua Whitsitt, and in the unreformed Legislative Council it had few supporters. Its accomplishments including the extension of public secondary education, the nationalisation of the Waddamana hydroelectricity scheme, and the establishment of the state&#x27;s first national parks, Mount Field and Freycinet. Earle authorised large quantities of wheat to be imported in 1914 to alleviate a drought and &quot;made large investments in public works to alleviate war-caused unemployment&quot;. During the early years of World War I he encouraged the unemployed to enlist in the military.

After the ALP was defeated at the 1916 election, Earle returned to his prior position as Leader of the Opposition. He viewed the aim of the ALP as &quot;true progressive liberalism&quot; rather than socialism, and some of his policy positions had alienated more radical members of the party, notably his support for overseas conscription. In November 1916, during the nationwide party split over conscription, he announced his resignation from the ALP in an open letter, stating that &quot;the movement has been corrupted by bodies of extremists, irresponsible and in some cases distinctly disloyal men, aided and abetted by the weakness, cowardice, and treachery of the officers of the organisation and members of the Parliamentary party obtaining control of the movement&quot;. He resignation was widely regarded as pre-empted his expulsion.

===Federal politics===
In March 1917 Earle, who had by then joined the Nationalist Party of Australia, was elected by the Parliament of Tasmania to fill a vacancy in the Australian Senate. He retained his seat in the 1917 election. He became Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Hughes ministry from December 1921 to February 1923. He was defeated at the Senate election held in December 1922, and again in 1925, as a Nationalist candidate. In 1928 he stood as an independent candidate in Franklin, but was unsuccessful.

== Death ==
Earle died at Kettering, Tasmania, on 6 February 1932. He left a widow but no children. His cousin, Alicia O&#x27;Shea Petersen, would later follow Earle into politics as a prominent suffragist.

==Legacy==
In 2009 Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd briefly noted the centenary of Earle forming Tasmania&#x27;s first Labor government.

<text>Lee&#x27;s Palace is a rock concert hall located on the south side of Bloor Street West east of Lippincott Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The two-floor facility in The Annex neighbourhood has a long history prior to being adapted in September 1985 for its current use as a concert venue and nightclub. While the Lee&#x27;s Palace live performance venue that accommodates just over 500 guest is on the ground floor, the top floor is occupied by The Dance Cave, a nightclub that on weekends mostly caters to university and college students from the nearby downtown Toronto schools such as University of Toronto, Toronto Metropolitan University, OCAD University, and George Brown College with alt-rock while attracting older patrons during the work week with a fare that includes goth rock, mod music, punk, and indie.

Having been established and owned for 16 years by the Korean Canadian entrepreneur Chong Su Lee a.k.a. Mr. Lee, the venue was purchased 2001 by Jeff Cohen with partners Ben Pearlman and Bruce Bennett that also has the Horseshoe Tavern, another iconic Toronto music venue, among its list of assets. 

In December 2023, Lee&#x27;s Palace was acquired by MODO LIVE, a Canadian based concert and live entertainment production company, as part of their venue portfolio which includes The Pearl on Granville in Vancouver, BC.

== History ==
The building at 529 Bloor Street West, which currently consists of two floors of 5,000 square feet each, dates back to early 1900s and was reportedly a bank at one point as well as a shoemaker shop.

===Allen&#x27;s Bloor Theatre===
During late 1910s, the building&#x27;s redesign was initiated by its new owners—Canadian-based Allen Theatres chain that decided to turn it into a silent film theater. With the redesign executed by the Detroit-based Howard Crane&#x27;s company, the 782-seat Allen&#x27;s Bloor Theatre became one of Toronto&#x27;s (a city of some 200,000 inhabitants at the time) most luxurious suburban movie houses. The undertaking came as part of Allen Theatres&#x27; aggressive 1917-1920 expansion into the Toronto marketplace, a period during which they built/redesigned many buildings around the city into theaters such as Allen&#x27;s Danforth on the Danforth and Allen&#x27;s Beach Theatre in the Beaches neighbourhood. Allen Theatres additionally purchased many existing Toronto theaters like the nearby Madison Picture Palace across the road on Bloor Street West and the 1,100-seat Beaver Theatre in the Junction neighbourhood.

Allen&#x27;s Bloor Theatre&#x27;s premiere screening was held on 10 March 1919 with Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Your Husband&quot; starring Gloria Swanson.

In 1923, the Allen Theatres chain was sold to Famous Players, which by 1928 financed major renovations to the theatre including building an orchestra pit. The venue remained an active movie theatre until 1957.

===The Blue Orchid===
Following a period of almost ten years during which the property remained vacant, in 1967, the venue was purchased for Can$129,000 by local entrepreneur Ed Silverberg who then invested further Can$250,000 in order to convert it into a cabaret named the Blue Orchid. Inspired by the New York City drag shows, it functioned as a dinner theatre featuring burlesque shows and plays with all-male casts.

It was Silverberg who decided to turn the venue&#x27;s upper balcony level into a tucked away, speakeasy-type bar with a dance floor. The Blue Orchid went away by 1976 and was replaced with Oriental Palace, a dinner and dance hospitality venue.

===Lee&#x27;s Palace===
By mid 1980s, the building was purchased by Chong Su Lee a.k.a. Mr. Lee, owner of a nearby Stop &amp; Go corner store on Bathurst and Harbord, who had become interested in the music venue concept through The Cameron House and the rest of the 1980s Queen West scene. On Thursday 5 September 1985, Lee&#x27;s Palace was opened as a music club by Mr. Lee, the venue&#x27;s namesake, with dancing on the top floor and live music on the main floor, much as it is today. The very first live show at the new venue on its opening night was Handsome Ned. The second live show—Blue Rodeo, who were booked on Handsome Ned&#x27;s recommendation—took place two weeks later on 19 September 1985. The club was open seven days a week initially with Sundays becoming its signature night featuring local Toronto entertainer Frank Fazi&#x27;s recurring Sunday Night Jam showcase with various local scene participants such as members of Greg Godovitz&#x27;s Goddo.

The venue&#x27;s early live concert booking policy—bringing fledgling local rock bands plus emerging international (mostly British and American) indie acts—established a formula that would be continued throughout the decades that followed. Initially, local Toronto-area and other Canadian acts were routinely recruited from the nearby Queen West scene: doing well at Queen West spots such as The Cameron House, Horseshoe Tavern, and The Rivoli would usually result in being booked at Lee&#x27;s Palace. The venue&#x27;s chief booker Craig Morrison—hired by and answering directly to the owner Mr. Lee—was reportedly extremely diligent about determining a local young band&#x27;s popularity and viability by scouting their Toronto bar and club gigs ahead of booking them at Lee&#x27;s, including subsequently keeping meticulous records on each booked act with information on the number of tickets sold and associated bar sales during the show. The Tragically Hip—five youngsters in their early-to-mid-20s from nearby Kingston gigging locally in bars throughout Ontario with no releases yet—played Lee&#x27;s Palace in late October 1986, years before becoming a best-selling and celebrated musical act in Canada. Ahead of the show, their manager Jake Gold reportedly phoned Morrison in order to try to negotiate a Can$75 fixed payout on top of the door intake but got flatly rejected.

Later that year, on Wednesday 3 December 1986, the venue hosted Red Hot Chili Peppers, a young band from Los Angeles that would go on to great commercial success within a few years. Supporting their second album and making their Toronto debut with a lineup featuring the band&#x27;s twenty-four-year-old founding member and original guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of drug overdose eighteen months later, the show—opened by fellow Southern California punk rockers T.S.O.L. and Thelonious Monster and closed with the Peppers infamous and soon-to-become signature trademark &#x27;socks-on-cocks&#x27; stage performance during an encore of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot;—marked the first instance of a future globally-known musical act playing Lee&#x27;s Palace.

==Artists who have played at Lee&#x27;s Palace==

The capacity of Lee&#x27;s Palace is roughly 600 people in the concert area, and more upstairs in the &quot;Dance Cave&quot;, the dance club under the same roof. The Dance Cave caters to the alternative rock crowd, playing retro rock, Mod, &#x27;60s, Britpop, and indie rock during the week, and straight alternative on the weekends.

Here is a selection of artists who have played at Lee&#x27;s Palace:

International artists

Canadian artists

==Regulatory agencies ==
As the venue serves alcohol, attendance at concerts and events at Lee&#x27;s Palace is generally restricted by the laws of the province of Ontario to those 19 years of age or older, although the venue occasionally hosts all-ages shows (usually on weekend afternoons or early evenings) where alcohol is not served.

<doc id="1177963" wikidata="Q250913" url="?curid=1177963" title="Gyrobifastigium">
<text>In geometry, the gyrobifastigium is a polyhedron that is constructed by attaching a triangular prism to square face of another one. It is an example of a Johnson solid. It is the only Johnson solid that can tile three-dimensional space.

== Construction and its naming ==
The gyrobifastigium can be constructed by attaching two triangular prisms along corresponding square faces, giving a quarter-turn to one prism. These prisms cover the square faces so the resulting polyhedron has four equilateral triangles and four squares, making eight faces in total, an octahedron. Because its faces are all regular polygons and it is convex, the gyrobifastigium is a Johnson solid, indexed as formula_1.

The name of the gyrobifastigium comes from the Latin &quot;fastigium&quot;, meaning a sloping roof. In the standard naming convention of the Johnson solids, &quot;bi-&quot; means two solids connected at their bases, and &quot;gyro-&quot; means the two halves are twisted with respect to each other.

Cartesian coordinates for the gyrobifastigium with regular faces and unit edge lengths may easily be derived from the formula of the height of unit edge length formula_2 as follows:
formula_3

== Properties ==
To calculate the formula for the surface area and volume of a gyrobifastigium with regular faces and with edge length formula_4, one may adapt the corresponding formulae for the triangular prism. Its surface area formula_5 can be obtained by summing the area of four equilateral triangles and four squares, whereas its volume formula_6 by slicing it off into two triangular prisms and adding their volume. That is:
formula_7

The Schmitt–Conway–Danzer biprism (also called a SCD prototile) is a polyhedron topologically equivalent to the gyrobifastigium, but with parallelogram and irregular triangle faces instead of squares and equilateral triangles. Like the gyrobifastigium, it can fill space, but only aperiodically or with a screw symmetry, not with a full three-dimensional group of symmetries. Thus, it provides a partial solution to the three-dimensional einstein problem.

The gyrated triangular prismatic honeycomb can be constructed by packing together large numbers of identical gyrobifastigiums.
The gyrobifastigium is one of five convex polyhedra with regular faces capable of space-filling (the others being the cube, truncated octahedron, triangular prism, and hexagonal prism) and it is the only Johnson solid capable of doing so.

The pentagonal gyrobicupola is a polyhedron that is constructed by attaching two pentagonal cupolas base-to-base, each of its cupolas is twisted at 36°. It is an example of a Johnson solid and a composite polyhedron.

== Construction ==
The pentagonal gyrobicupola is a composite polyhedron: it is constructed by attaching two pentagonal cupolas base-to-base. This construction is similar to the pentagonal orthobicupola; the difference is that one of cupolas in the pentagonal gyrobicupola is twisted at 36°, as suggested by the prefix &quot;gyro-&quot;. The resulting polyhedron has the same faces as the pentagonal orthobicupola does: those cupolas cover their decagonal bases, replacing it with eight equilateral triangles, eight squares, and two regular pentagons. A convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The pentagonal gyrobicupola has such these, enumerating it as the thirty-first Johnson solid formula_3.

== Properties ==
Because it has a similar construction as the pentagonal orthobicupola, the surface area of a pentagonal gyrobicupola formula_4 is the sum of polygonal faces&#x27; area, and its volume formula_5 is twice the volume of a pentagonal cupola for which slicing it into those:

In geometry, the augmented triangular prism is a polyhedron constructed by attaching an equilateral square pyramid onto the square face of a triangular prism. As a result, it is an example of Johnson solid. It can be visualized as the chemical compound, known as capped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry.

== Construction ==
The augmented triangular prism can be constructed from a triangular prism by attaching an equilateral square pyramid to one of its square faces, a process known as augmentation. This square pyramid covers the square face of the prism, so the resulting polyhedron has 6 equilateral triangles and 2 squares as its faces. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is Johnson solid, and the augmented triangular prism is among them, enumerated as 49th Johnson solid formula_2.

== Properties ==
An augmented triangular prism with edge length formula_3 has a surface area, calculated by adding six equilateral triangles and two squares&#x27; area:
formula_4
Its volume can be obtained by slicing it into a regular triangular prism and an equilateral square pyramid, and adding their volume subsequently:
formula_5

It has three-dimensional symmetry group of the cyclic group formula_6 of order 4. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of an equilateral square pyramid and a regular triangular prism in the following:
* The dihedral angle of an augmented triangular prism between two adjacent triangles is that of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangular faces, formula_7
* The dihedral angle of an augmented triangular prism between two adjacent squares is that of a triangular prism between two lateral faces, the interior angle of a triangular prism formula_8.
* The dihedral angle of an augmented triangular prism between square and triangle is the dihedral angle of a triangular prism between the base and its lateral face, formula_9
* The dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between a triangular face and its base is formula_10. Therefore, the dihedral angle of an augmented triangular prism between a square (the lateral face of the triangular prism) and triangle (the lateral face of the equilateral square pyramid) on the edge where the equilateral square pyramid is attached to the square face of the triangular prism, and between two adjacent triangles (the lateral face of both equilateral square pyramids) on the edge where two equilateral square pyramids are attached adjacently to the triangular prism, are formula_11

== Application ==
In the geometry of chemical compounds, a polyhedron may commonly visualize an atom cluster surrounding a central atom. The capped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry describes clusters for which this polyhedron is an augmented triangular prism. An example of such compound is the potassium heptafluorotantalate.

In geometry, the biaugmented triangular prism is a polyhedron constructed from a triangular prism by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto two of its square faces. It is an example of Johnson solid. It can be found in stereochemistry in bicapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry.

== Construction ==
The biaugmented triangular prism can be constructed from a triangular prism by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto its two square faces, a process known as augmentation. These pyramids covers the square face of the prism, so the resulting polyhedron has 10 equilateral triangles and 1 square as its faces. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular polygons is Johnson solid. The biaugmented triangular prism is among them, enumerated as 50th Johnson solid formula_2.

== Properties ==
A biaugmented triangular prism with edge length formula_3 has a surface area, calculated by adding ten equilateral triangles and one square&#x27;s area:
formula_4
Its volume can be obtained by slicing it into a regular triangular prism and two equilateral square pyramids, and adding their volumes subsequently:
formula_5

It has three-dimensional symmetry group of the cyclic group formula_6 of order 4. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of an equilateral square pyramid and a regular triangular prism in the following:
* The dihedral angle of a biaugmented triangular prism between two adjacent triangles is that of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangular faces, formula_7
* The dihedral angle of a biaugmented triangular prism between square and triangle is the dihedral angle of a triangular prism between the base and its lateral face, formula_8
* The dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between a triangular face and its base is formula_9. The dihedral angle of a triangular prism between two adjacent square faces is the internal angle of an equilateral triangle formula_10. Therefore, the dihedral angle of a biaugmented triangular prism between a square (the lateral face of the triangular prism) and triangle (the lateral face of the equilateral square pyramid) on the edge where the equilateral square pyramid is attached to the square face of the triangular prism, and between two adjacent triangles (the lateral face of both equilateral square pyramids) on the edge where two equilateral square pyramids are attached adjacently to the triangular prism, are formula_11
* The dihedral angle of a biaugmented triangular prism between two adjacent triangles (the base of a triangular prism and the lateral face of an equilateral square pyramid) on the edge where the equilateral square pyramid is attached to the triangular prism, is: formula_12

== Appearance ==
The biaugmented triangular prism can be found in stereochemistry, as a structural shape of a chemical compound known as bicapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry. It is one of the three common shapes for transition metal complexes with eight vertices other than the chemical structure other than square antiprism and the snub disphenoid. An example of such structure is plutonium(III) bromide PuBr3 adopted by bromides and iodides of the lanthanides and actinides.

Èsa means &quot;barrel&quot;, and it was this object that was found in the place of the natural disaster; a barrel full of oil which gave rise to the name. The dialect translation of the name (Éza) means &quot;barrel&quot;.

<text>In geometry, the augmented pentagonal prism is a polyhedron that can be constructed by attaching an equilateral square pyramid onto the square face of pentagonal prism. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The augmented pentagonal prism can be constructed from a pentagonal prism by attaching an equilateral square pyramid to one of its square faces, a process known as augmentation. This square pyramid covers the square face of the prism, so the resulting polyhedron has four equilateral triangles, four squares, and two regular pentagons as its faces. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is Johnson solid, and the augmented pentagonal prism is among them, enumerated as 52nd Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
An augmented pentagonal prism with edge length formula_2 has a surface area, calculated by adding the area of four equilateral triangles, four squares, and two regular pentagons:formula_3
Its volume can be obtained by slicing it into a regular pentagonal prism and an equilateral square pyramid, and adding their volume subsequently:formula_4

The dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism can be calculated by adding the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid and the regular pentagonal prism:
* the dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism between two adjacent triangular faces is that of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangular faces, formula_5,
* the dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism between two adjacent square faces is the internal angle of a regular pentagon formula_6.
* the dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism between square-to-pentagon is that of a regular pentagonal prism between its base and its lateral faces formula_7.
* the dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism between pentagon-to-triangle is formula_8, for which adding the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between its base and its lateral face formula_9, and the dihedral angle of a regular pentagonal prism between its base and its lateral face.
* the dihedral angle of an augmented pentagonal prism between square-to-triangle is formula_10, for which adding the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between its base and its lateral face, and the dihedral angle of a regular pentagonal prism between two adjacent squares.

<text>Fatsia is a small genus of three species of evergreen shrubs in the family Araliaceae native to southern Japan and Taiwan. They typically have stout, sparsely branched stems bearing spirally-arranged, large leathery, palmately lobed leaves 20–50 cm in width, on a petiole up to 50 cm long, and small creamy-white flowers in dense terminal compound umbels in late autumn or early winter, followed by small black fruit. The genus was formerly classified within a broader interpretation of the related genus &quot;Aralia&quot;.

==Species==
A sterile hybrid between &quot;Fatsia japonica&quot; and &quot;Hedera hibernica&quot;, named × &quot;Fatshedera lizei&quot;, has been produced in cultivation in western Europe in both plain green and variegated forms.

Some species formerly included in &quot;Fatsia&quot; are now classified in other genera. &quot;Fatsia papyrifera&quot; is now &quot;Tetrapanax papyrifer&quot; and &quot;Fatsia horrida&quot; is now &quot;Oplopanax horridus&quot;.

<doc id="1177979" wikidata="Q643128" url="?curid=1177979" title="Augmented hexagonal prism">
<text>In geometry, the augmented hexagonal prism is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by augmenting a hexagonal prism by attaching a square pyramid () to one of its equatorial faces. When two or three such pyramids are attached, the result may be a parabiaugmented hexagonal prism (), a metabiaugmented hexagonal prism (), or a triaugmented hexagonal prism ().

== Construction ==
The augmented hexagonal prism is constructed by attaching one equilateral square pyramid onto the square face of a hexagonal prism, a process known as augmentation. This construction involves the removal of the prism square face and replacing it with the square pyramid, so that there are eleven faces: four equilateral triangles, five squares, and two regular hexagons. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular is a Johnson solid, and the augmented hexagonal prism is among them, enumerated as formula_1. Relatedly, two or three equilateral square pyramids attaching onto more square faces of the prism give more different Johnson solids; these are the parabiaugmented hexagonal prism formula_2, the metabiaugmented hexagonal prism formula_3, and the triaugmented hexagonal prism formula_4.

== Properties ==
An augmented hexagonal prism with edge length formula_5 has surface area
formula_6
the sum of two hexagons, four equilateral triangles, and five squares area. Its volume
formula_7
can be obtained by slicing into one equilateral square pyramid and one hexagonal prism, and adding their volume up.

It has an axis of symmetry passing through the apex of a square pyramid and the centroid of a prism square face, rotated in a half and full-turn angle. Its dihedral angle can be obtained by calculating the angle of a square pyramid and a hexagonal prism in the following:
* The dihedral angle of an augmented hexagonal prism between two adjacent triangles is the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid, formula_8
* The dihedral angle of an augmented hexagonal prism between two adjacent squares is the interior of a regular hexagon, formula_9
* The dihedral angle of an augmented hexagonal prism between square-to-hexagon is the dihedral angle of a hexagonal prism between its base and its lateral face, formula_10
* The dihedral angle of a square pyramid between triangle (its lateral face) and square (its base) is formula_11. Therefore, the dihedral angle of an augmented hexagonal prism between square-to-triangle and between triangle-to-hexagon, on the edge in which the square pyramid and hexagonal prism are attached, are formula_12.

When pyramids are attached to a dodecahedron in other ways, they may result in an augmented dodecahedron (), a metabiaugmented dodecahedron (), a triaugmented dodecahedron (), or even a pentakis dodecahedron if the faces are made to be irregular.

The dual of this solid is the Gyroelongated pentagonal bifrustum.

<text>El Campo Santo (Spanish for &quot;The Holy Field&quot;) is a cemetery located at the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum, 15415 East Don Julian Road, in City of Industry, California.

As one of the oldest private cemeteries in Southern California, El Campo Santo contains the remains of the pioneering Workman-Temple family as well as Pío Pico, the last governor of Alta California, and other prominent pioneer families. Within its low brick walls, the one-half acre cemetery features a Neoclassical mausoleum and a small cemetery plot surrounded by a Gothic Revival cast-iron fence.

In the early 1850s, the family of William Workman (1799–1867) established El Campo Santo, or &quot;the sacred ground,&quot; as a cemetery solely for the use of their family. Along with a cemetery plot enclosed by an ornate cast-iron fence, they built a Gothic Revival brick chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas by Bishop Thaddeus Amat of Los Angeles. Among the first to be buried here was William Workman&#x27;s brother David Workman (1797–1855), who was killed in an accident while driving cattle to the gold fields in Northern California.

At the turn of the 20th century, the cemetery was abandoned and its brick chapel destroyed by fire. Walter P. Temple, a grandson of the Workmans, successfully filed a lawsuit preventing any further desecration of the cemetery. In 1917, he was able to purchase the cemetery and the surrounding and began restoration. In place of the chapel, however, he built a cast stone Neoclassical mausoleum and moved the remains of his family inside. In 1921, he also transferred the remains of Pío Pico and his wife, Ygnacia Alvarado de Pico, from old Calvary Cemetery on North Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, which was being relocated, and had them entombed in the mausoleum.

The Workman Home and Family Cemetery are designated California Historical Landmark No. 874. The cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, No. 145, on November 20, 1974.

El Campo Santo is open to visitors through a self-guided tour described in the free brochure available at the museum office.

<doc id="1178011" wikidata="Q382882" url="?curid=1178011" title="Sicko">
<text>Sicko is a 2007 American political documentary film by filmmaker Michael Moore. Investigating health care in the United States, the film focuses on the country&#x27;s health insurance and the pharmaceutical industry. Moore compares the for-profit non-universal U.S. system with the non-profit universal health care systems of Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Cuba.

Produced on a roughly $9 million budget, &quot;Sicko&quot; grossed $25 million theatrically in North America. This exceeded the official expectation of The Weinstein Company, which had hoped to be in line with &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;″s $22 million U.S. box office gross.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Sicko&quot; begins by noting that almost 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2007 while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of insurance company fraud and red tape. &quot;Sicko&quot; mentions that the World Health Organization ranks U.S. health in general as 37 out of 191 countries and ranks some U.S. health measures, such as infant mortality and life expectancy, as equal to countries with much less economic wealth. Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons for the company to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability.

The history of the American health care debate serves as a backdrop. Opponents of universal health care are set in the context of 1950s-style anti-communist propaganda. A 1961 record distributed by the American Medical Association, narrated by corporate spokesmodel Ronald Reagan, warns that universal health care could lead to lost freedoms and socialism. In response, Moore shows that socialized public services like police, fire service, the United States Postal Service, public education and community libraries have not led to communism in the United States.

===Canada===
In Canada, a citizen describes the case of Tommy Douglas, who was voted the greatest Canadian in 2004 for his contributions to the Canadian health system. Moore also interviews a microsurgeon and people waiting in the emergency room of a Canadian public hospital.

===HMO origin in the 1970s===
The origins of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 are presented using a taped conversation between John Ehrlichman and President Richard Nixon on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that &quot;the less care they give them, the more money they make&quot;, a plan that Nixon remarked was &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;not bad&quot;. This led to the expansion of the modern health maintenance organization-based health care system. Connections are highlighted between Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the largest drug companies in the United States, lobbying groups in Washington, D.C., and the Congress. Hillary Clinton, a champion of the Clinton health care plan, is shown as a crusader for change, appointed to reform the health care system in the United States by her husband, newly elected President Bill Clinton. Her efforts are met with heavy-handed criticisms by Republicans on Capitol Hill, and right-wing media throughout the country, who characterize her plan as the harbinger of socialism. When she is defeated, her punishment is to &quot;never speak of it again while in the White House.&quot; Seven years later, her silence is rewarded, as she becomes a Senator via healthcare industry contributions, the second largest recipient in the Senate.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a country whose National Health Service is a comprehensive publicly funded health care system, Moore interviews patients and inquires about in-hospital expenses incurred by patients, only to be told that there are no out-of-pocket payments. Moore visits a typical UK pharmacy, where pharmaceuticals are free of charge for all persons in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and under 16, 16–17 in full-time education, disabled, unemployed, or over 60 in England, and subsidized in most cases for everyone else (in England); only a fixed amount of £6.65 (about $10) per item on a prescription was charged, irrespective of cost to the NHS. Further, NHS hospitals employ a cashier, part of whose job is to reimburse low-income patients for their out-of-pocket travel costs to the hospital. Interviews include an NHS general practitioner, an American woman residing in London, and former British politician Tony Benn, who compares a hypothetical dismantling of the NHS to ending women&#x27;s suffrage and says it would lead to a revolution.

===France===
In France, Moore visits a hospital and interviews the head of obstetrics and gynaecology and a group of American expatriates. Moore rides with the &quot;SOS Médecins&quot;, a 24-hour French medical service that provides house calls by physicians. Moore discovers that the French government provides many social services and rights in addition to health care, such as daycare for $1 an hour, free college education, a minimum five weeks paid vacation by law, vacation, and neonatal support that includes cooking, cleaning, and laundry services for new mothers.

===Return to US===
Returning to the United States, interviews disclose that 9/11 rescue workers who volunteered after the September 11, 2001 attacks were denied government funds to care for physical and psychological illnesses they subsequently developed, including respiratory disease and PTSD-induced bruxism. Unable to receive and afford medical care in the United States, the 9/11 rescue workers, as well as all of Moore&#x27;s friends in the film needing medical attention, set sail from Miami to Cuba on three speedboats in order to obtain free medical care provided for the detainees at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detainment camp.

===Cuba===
The group arrives at the entrance channel to &quot;Gitmo&quot; and Moore uses a megaphone to request access, pleading for the 9/11 victims to receive treatment that is on par with the medical attention the detainees are receiving. The attempt ceases when a siren is blown from the base, and the group moves on to Havana, where they purchase inexpensive medicine and receive free medical treatment at the elite Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital. Providing only their names and birth dates, the rescue workers are hospitalized and receive medical attention. Before they leave, the 9/11 rescue workers are honored by a local Havana fire station.

Finally, Moore addresses the audience, emphasizing that people should be &quot;taking care of each other, no matter the differences.&quot; To demonstrate his personal commitment to this theme, Moore decides to help one of his biggest critics, Jim Kenefick. According to a blog posting, Kenefick feared he would have to shut down his anti-Moore website because he needed US$12,000 to cover the costs of medical treatment for his sick wife. Not wanting the U.S. health care system to limit Kenefick&#x27;s ability to express his opinion, Moore sends Kenefick the money himself.

This film ends with Moore walking towards the United States Capitol with a basket full of his clothes, sarcastically saying he will get the government to do his laundry until a better day comes for the sick and hopeless who are unable to receive health care.

The North American première of &quot;Sicko&quot; was held in London, Ontario (where some scenes from the movie were filmed), at the Silver City movie theatre at Masonville Place on June 8, 2007, with Moore in attendance. It also had an early première in Washington, D.C., on June 20, two days before its U.S. release, with Moore appearing at a Capitol Hill press conference to promote the film.

The European première was held in Great Britain on October 24, 2007, at the Odeon Leicester Square as part of the 51st London Film Festival. Moore was to introduce the film, but remained in the United States due to a &#x27;family issue&#x27;, sending a lengthy letter to be read in his absence. Part of the letter gave thanks to the Rt Hon. Tony Benn, featured in the film, who delivered a short speech before the showing.

On December 13, 2024, in the aftermath of the Killing of Brian Thompson, which renewed public criticism of the health insurance industry, Moore uploaded the entirety of &quot;Sicko&quot; to YouTube on his official channel, arguing for health care reform as a &quot;solution that does not involve any violence&quot;.
===Box office===
Made on a budget of $9 million, &quot;Sicko&quot; earned $4.5 million on its opening weekend. In 441 theaters, it took in an average of $10,204 per theater, the second-highest average gross of the weekend. As of February 24, 2008, &quot;Sicko&quot; has grossed $25 million in the United States and $11 million in foreign markets. Overall, the movie has made over $36 million. The film was also a huge success in DVD sales, in which it accumulated over $60 million in sales.

===Critical reaction===
According to the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film boasts a 92% positive rating, based on 218 reviews, with an average rating of 7.71/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Driven by Michael Moore&#x27;s sincere humanism, &quot;Sicko&quot; is a devastating, convincing, and very entertaining documentary about the state of America&#x27;s health care.&quot; Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 39 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. After its Cannes release, &quot;Variety&quot; described &quot;Sicko&quot; as &quot;an affecting and entertaining dissection of the American health care industry&quot;.

In an early review a week before the premiere, Richard Roeper and Michael Phillips gave the film two thumbs up. Roger Friedman of Fox News called the film a &quot;brilliant and uplifting new film&quot; and praised Moore for the way in which he lets &quot;very articulate average Americans tell their personal horror stories at the hands of insurance companies&quot; and &quot;criticizes both Democrats and Republicans for their inaction and in some cases their willingness to be bribed by pharmaceutical companies and insurance carriers.&quot;

British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; praised Moore&#x27;s filmmaking and personal artistic vision, exclaiming &quot;&quot;Sicko&quot; is the film that truly reveals Moore as an auteur.&quot;

David Denby of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;feeble, even inane&quot;, but film critic Stephen Schaefer of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described &quot;Sicko&quot; as &quot;a very strong and very honest film about a health system that&#x27;s totally corrupt and that is without any care for its patients&quot;.

The film was listed as the 4th best film of 2007 by Carina Chocano of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, as well as 8th best by Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Sicko&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and Moore was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay. It was also commended in the Australian Film Critics Association 2007 Film Award for Best Documentary.

==Response==

===News media===
Journalist and free market advocate John Stossel wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that claimed Julie Pierce&#x27;s husband, Tracy, featured in &quot;Sicko&quot;, would not have been saved by the bone marrow transplant denied by his insurer. Stossel also questioned whether this treatment would have been given in a universal health care system, citing rationing and long waiting lists in Canada and Britain. Julie Pierce claimed Stossel never contacted her or her husband&#x27;s doctors, and that the insurer denied other treatments as well and questioned Stossel&#x27;s assertion that Tracy would not have received this in a socialized system, arguing that they are performed more frequently in Canada than in the U.S.

Moore insisted in the movie as well as in an interview with Stossel that the treatment provided in the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital was just like that given to any Cuban; but Stossel&#x27;s investigations led Stossel to conclude that the hospital provided service only for the Cuban elite and that this care was not available to the average Cuban. In response to criticism that only well-to-do Cuban citizens receive a decent standard of health care, Michael Moore adduced on his website the result of an independent Gallup Poll in which &quot;a near unanimous 96 percent of respondents say that health care in Cuba is accessible to everyone&quot;. An article in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; interviewing some Cuban exiles in the United States criticized &quot;Sicko&quot; for painting a rosy picture of the Cuban healthcare system.

In an article published in both &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, Michael C. Moynihan called the film &quot;touching, naïve and maddeningly mendacious, a clumsy piece of agitprop that will likely have little lasting effect on the health care debate&quot;. Surgeon and Associate Director of Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Center for Surgery and Public Health Atul Gawande commented, &quot;&quot;Sicko&quot; is a revelation. And what makes this especially odd to say is that the movie brings to light nothing that the media haven’t covered extensively for years.&quot;

Kurt Loder criticized the film as presenting cherry-picked facts, manipulative interviews, and unsubstantiated assertions. While admitting that the U.S. health care system needs reform, Loder criticized Moore&#x27;s advocacy of government control, arguing that many services controlled by the government are not considered efficient by the American public. Loder points to a 2005 film, &quot;Dead Meat&quot;, by Stuart Browning and Blaine Greenberg, which documents long waiting lists for care in Canada. Loder points to calls for reform in Britain and France due to the same rationing.

&quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; Richard Wolf said, &quot;&quot;Sicko&quot; uses omission, exaggeration and cinematic sleight of hand to make its points.&quot;

WBAI Radio, part of the Pacifica Radio Network, reported that &quot;Sicko&quot; was revitalizing the debate for universal health care within the United States, calling the film &quot;adrenaline for healthcare activists.&quot;

===Healthcare industry===
In a letter responding to a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed by David Gratzer that was critical of the film, Robert S. Bell, M.D., President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that while Moore &quot;exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system&quot;, it provides universal coverage of a similar quality to that enjoyed by only some Americans. Michael Moore posted a leaked memo from a Capital Blue Cross employee about the likely consequences of the film. The memo expresses concern that the movie turns people against Capital Blue Cross by linking it to abuses by for-profit HMOs.

A July 9, 2007 broadcast of CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot; aired a &quot;fact check&quot; segment by CNN&#x27;s senior health correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on &quot;Sicko&quot;. Immediately following the segment, Moore was interviewed live on CNN by Wolf Blitzer. Moore stated that Gupta&#x27;s report was inaccurate and biased. Moore posted a point-by-point response on his website. After a debate with Moore on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Gupta posted a message about his position on &quot;Sicko&quot; and CNN&#x27;s coverage.

====Wendell Potter====
Wendell Potter admitted that while he was working as Head of Corporate Communications at CIGNA, the health insurance industry umbrella agency America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans had developed a campaign to discredit Michael Moore and the movie. When asked what he thought about the film Potter said that &quot;I thought that he hit the nail on the head with his movie. But the industry, from the moment that the industry learned that Michael Moore was taking on the health care industry, it was really concerned ... They were afraid that people would believe Michael Moore.&quot;

Journalist Bill Moyers reported that PBS had obtained a copy of the &quot;game plan&quot; that was adopted by the industry&#x27;s trade association, America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to &quot;highlight horror stories of government-run systems&quot;. Potter explained, &quot;The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are the worst thing that could possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you&#x27;re heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern.&quot;

Moyers reported and Potter confirmed that there were attempts to radicalize Moore in an effort to discredit the film&#x27;s message. Moore would be referred to as a &quot;Hollywood entertainer&quot; or &quot;Hollywood moviemaker&quot; to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. &quot;They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That&#x27;s part of the strategy.&quot; Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was &quot;blunted&quot; by the public relations campaign. He agreed that &quot;Sicko&quot; contained &quot;a great truth&quot; which he said was &quot;that we shouldn&#x27;t fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it&#x27;s been proven in the countries that were in that movie. You know, we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom. We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay-off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, or being purged by their insurance company, and winding up there.&quot;

===Think tanks===
The free-market think tanks, such as the Manhattan Institute, say that &quot;Sicko&quot; misrepresented the health systems of Canada, the United Kingdom and Cuba, and criticized it for its negative portrayal of the American health insurance system compared to these countries.

The National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative American think tank, has also been critical of Moore&#x27;s claims, focusing particularly on lengthy waiting lists and unavailability of new treatments in the publicly funded health systems of the United Kingdom and Canada, an aspect of those systems which they allege Moore failed to address.

The left-of-center/liberal-leaning Urban Institute (UI) largely agreed with Moore regarding the need for a universal health care system and failure of the current system. Urban Institute economist Linda Blumberg stated that Moore correctly provides evidence that the current system fails and a universal system is needed, adding that any system will face budget constraints. Overall, Blumberg stated that &quot;Americans as a whole have yet to buy the philosophy that health care is a right and not a privilege&quot; and if Moore succeeded in popularizing the idea, he &quot;will have done the country a tremendous service.&quot; Bradford Gary agrees with the main points made by Moore but criticizes the film for making various omissions and lacking attention to detail, stating that &quot;though Moore is not interested in the details behind the outrages he has assembled, many of his fundamental points are nevertheless accurate.&quot;

===Moorewatch===
Regarding Moore&#x27;s donation to Jim and Donna Kenefick of Moorewatch.com, while Donna Kenefick thanked Moore, saying his money &quot;paid for our health insurance premiums and gave us the financial breathing room to both deal with our debts&quot;, Jim Kenefick disputed Moore&#x27;s account of these events, saying that his insurance would have paid for his wife&#x27;s needs, and that his sites were in operation again thanks to reader donations long before he ever received Moore&#x27;s check. Kenefick accused Moore of presenting his words out of context in order to defame him, and both Kenefick and his onetime co-blogger, Lee, criticized Moore for claiming to make this donation anonymously, only to highlight it in his film. They accuse him of being motivated by a desire for publicity and self-aggrandizement rather than altruism.

At a Cannes press conference, after the identity of the donor was revealed, Moore said: &quot;I had to ask myself, &#x27;Would you write this check if this wasn&#x27;t in the film?&#x27;. I decided this is what I would do, and what I should do, and this is the way I want Americans to live.&quot;

===WikiLeaks cable on Cuba and &quot;Sicko&quot;===
&quot;Sicko&quot; was shown in theaters throughout Cuba and on national TV. Despite this, former United States Interests Section in Havana chief Michael E. Parmly wrote a diplomatic cable on January 31, 2008, which in part read: 
&quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, which collaborated with WikiLeaks, who leaked the cable, initially reported the cable&#x27;s claim as fact, then printed that Moore complained about the factual error, and finally &quot;The Guardian&quot; printed a correction, confirming the film was in fact shown in Cuba. Moore argued that US officials simply made up the story to discredit the film as it portrays the US healthcare system in a negative light.

==Legal controversy==

===Unauthorized distribution===
The film was leaked onto the Internet two weeks before its official release on June 29, 2007. Moore denied leaking the film for publicity, and an investigation was made into the source of the Internet leak. When asked about the leak, Moore said, &quot;I&#x27;m just happy that people get to see my movies. I&#x27;m not a big supporter of the copyright laws in this country ... I don&#x27;t understand bands or filmmakers ... who oppose sharing, having their work being shared by people, because it only increases your fanbase.&quot;

===Treasury Department probe===
In a May 2, 2007 letter, the Office of Foreign Assets Control informed Moore that he was the subject of a civil investigation stemming from the filmmaker&#x27;s March trip to Cuba. In the letter to Moore, a Treasury official noted that the department had no record of Moore obtaining a license that authorized him to &quot;engage in travel-related transactions involving Cuba&quot;, alleging that Moore violated the United States embargo against Cuba. A duplicate master copy of the film was being held in Canada should an attempt have been made by American authorities to seize the film as part of the investigation against Moore that arose from taking the American 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for medical treatment. Moore has said that trips made for conducting journalism are usually covered under a general license, which does not require preauthorization by the State Department. Moore states that his intentions were to travel to the US Naval base in Guantánamo Bay. Upon Moore&#x27;s arrival at Guantánamo Bay, a siren was sounded and Moore decided to turn around for safety.

On &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Moore reported that he was notified that a subpoena regarding his trip to Cuba had already been issued. According to an anonymous source reported by Reuters, Moore has not been served; rather, the government contacted his attorney, David Boies, to discuss the logistics of serving a subpoena.

==Deleted scenes and extras==
The DVD release includes deleted segments that Moore filmed but did not use in the theatrical release. Several scenes from the section about health care in the United Kingdom feature footage of a homeless shelter where people received acupuncture and foot massages. Discarded scenes in France include an interview with an employee from General Electric, who tells Moore they get benefits in France that GE employees do not receive in the United States. Scenes showing Moore&#x27;s visit to Norway and depicting its healthcare system, social benefits, and rehabilitation-based prison system were removed from the film because the Norwegian healthcare system, which is supervised by the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, possesses numerous benefits similar to the French system. Like the French health care system, Norwegian patients treated for illnesses such as psoriasis or rheumatism are shown eligible for two weeks&#x27; paid vacation at a spa in the Canary Islands. Norway hires a government ethicist to determine how to invest the windfall from the country&#x27;s oil wealth, because they want to do it in an ethical manner. A scene where Moore visits Bastøy Prison, a Norwegian island prison, was also deleted. Here, inmates reside in small group homes and focus on rehabilitation through manual labor and farming.

Deleted American health care scenes include an uninsured woman who was offered a 50% discount for treatment of spinal cancer. She still could not afford the initial consultations, so she held a fundraiser to pay for it. After the initial visit, the 50 percent discount was revoked when the hospital discovered that she had obtained the money to pay for her treatment through fundraising, which the hospital considered to be earned income. An interview with Marcia Angell was also deleted. The former editor of &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; criticizes various practices of pharmaceutical companies and the Food and Drug Administration. Executive producer Harvey Weinstein asked Moore to remove a scene critical of Hillary Clinton, but Moore refused. Weinstein, whose company provided financing for the film, is a friend of the Clinton family.

In the DVD edition of the film, Moore added a segment called &quot;&quot;Sicko&quot; Goes to Washington&quot;. This extra promotes the United States National Health Care Act, legislation that would create a single-payer health care system within the United States.

<text>Murray A. Lightburn is a Canadian musician and composer, best known as the lead vocalist and principal songwriter for The Dears. 

Lightburn has been called &quot;the black Morrissey&quot; due to his vocal similarity (and shared penchant for somewhat dark lyrics) to the former The Smiths lead singer. Incidentally, The Dears toured as Morrissey&#x27;s opening act during Morrissey&#x27;s solo tour in 2006.

In 2013 he released the solo album &quot;Mass: Light&quot;. His second solo album, &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;, was released in 2019.

His album &quot;Once Upon a Time in Montreal&quot; was longlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.

As a composer, Murray has produced original music for films including &quot;Any Other Way: The Jackie Shane Story&quot;, &quot;I Like Movies&quot;, and &quot;Too Much Sleep&quot;. Other credits include scores for TV series &quot;Near or Far&quot; (to be released in 2024 on CBC Gem), &quot;Black Life: Untold Stories&quot;, and original soundtrack for &quot;We Happy Few&quot; including the theme for the Lightbearer DLC.

<doc id="1178020" wikidata="Q5152839" url="?curid=1178020" title="Commissioner of Transport for London">
<text>The commissioner of transport for London has management responsibility for Transport for London (TfL) and hence for the transport system throughout the City of London and Greater London in the United Kingdom. TfL is controlled by a board whose members are appointed by the Mayor of London, who also chairs the Board. The commissioner reports to the board and leads a management team with individual functional responsibilities. The commissioner is therefore the most senior transport official in the capital.

== History ==
In 2000, Transport for London (TfL) was created as part of the Greater London Authority, gaining many of its functions from its predecessor, London Regional Transport. The commissioner post was initially held from 2001, by Bob Kiley. His CV included the CIA, CEO of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, deputy mayor of Boston, Chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and President and CEO of the New York City Partnership. He was credited as being the architect of the revival of Boston and New York&#x27;s ailing public transport systems in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.

Kiley announced his resignation in late 2005, and was replaced in February 2006 by Peter Hendy, previously TfL&#x27;s Director of Surface Transport. In July 2015, Hendy left to become chairman of Network Rail and was replaced on an interim basis by Mike Brown (the Managing Director of London Underground and London Rail). 

Mike Brown was appointed as the new commissioner in September 2015. Following the November 2016 Croydon tram derailment, Brown was one of two top TfL officials to decline a performance bonus. In October 2019, TfL announced that Brown would be leaving his role as commissioner in May 2020 to chair the Delivery Authority for the restoration of the Houses of Parliament. 

In May 2020, Andy Byford, former president of the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) and former CEO of the Toronto Transit Commission was announced as the new commissioner by the TfL Board. Following the opening of the Elizabeth line, Byford resigned as commissioner in September 2022, citing a desire to return to the U.S. and spend more time with his family. Byford left the position in October 2022, replaced on an interim basis by Andy Lord (the Chief Operating Officer of London Underground).

In June 2023, Andy Lord was appointed commissioner on a permanent basis by the TfL board.

<doc id="1178025" wikidata="Q133623" url="?curid=1178025" title="Xanthocyparis">
<text>Xanthocyparis is a genus of cypresses in the family Cupressaceae. , it has only one species, Xanthocyparis vietnamensis, native to Vietnam and southeast China. It is commonly known as the Vietnamese golden cypress. The Nootka cypress, &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; or &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot;, was also placed in the genus, but this has been rejected.

==Taxonomy==
In 2002, Aljos Farjon and others described the new genus &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; to accommodate the new Vietnamese species &quot;X. vietnamensis&quot; and another species, the Nootka cypress, which had been formerly included in the genus &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; as &quot;C. nootkatensis&quot;. This was based in part on the discovery that &quot;C. nootkatensis&quot; was more closely related to the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot; than to &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;.

In 2004, Damon Little and others, while confirming the above relationship with further evidence, pointed out that as circumscribed by Farjon &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; included the type species of &quot;Callitropsis&quot; (&quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Chamaecyparis nootkatensis&quot; and &quot;Xanthocyparis nootkatensis&quot;). &quot;Callitropsis&quot; had been described by Anders Sandøe Ørsted in 1864, but this name had been overlooked by Farjon and most other authors; under the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, &quot;Callitropsis&quot; as the earlier-published name had nomenclatural priority over &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; if that genus included &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot;. Little &quot;et al.&quot; therefore recognized &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Callitropsis&quot;. The name &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; was proposed for conservation over &quot;Callitropsis&quot;, a decision that was ratified at the International Botanical Congress in 2011.

Little &quot;et al.&quot; also presented evidence that &quot;Cupressus&quot; is paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Juniperus&quot; and &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot;, with the North American species of &quot;Cupressus&quot; being more closely related to &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; than they are to the European and Asian &quot;Cupressus&quot; species. These species were transferred to &quot;Callitropsis&quot; by Damon Little in 2006, although this transfer was not universally accepted. In 2009, most of the North American species previously included in &quot;Callitropsis&quot; were placed in a separate genus, &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;.

A 2021 molecular study found &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; to be sister to a clade comprising &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot; and &quot;Callitropsis&quot;, with the clade containing all three being sister to a clade comprising &quot;Juniperus&quot; and &quot;Cupressus sensu stricto&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;Xanthocyparis vietnamensis&quot; was originally described as endemic to Vietnam, being native only to the karst limestone mountains of the Hà Giang Province in northern Vietnam. It has since also been recorded in Cao Bằng and Tuyên Quang provinces in Vietnam, as well as southeast China (Guangxi).

<doc id="1178027" wikidata="Q838737" url="?curid=1178027" title="Mercury Bay">
<text>Mercury Bay is a large V-shaped bay on the eastern coast of the Coromandel Peninsula on the North Island of New Zealand. It was named by the English navigator Captain James Cook during his exploratory expeditions. It was first named &quot;Te-Whanganui-a-Hei&quot;, the great bay of Hei, by the Māori.

On 9 November 1769 Cook landed on the shores of the bay to observe a Transit of Mercury. In 1919 an area of land around Shakespeare Cliff was set aside, and a small memorial was constructed, based on the erroneous notion that it was the location of Cook&#x27;s observations. But the actual site of Cook&#x27;s landing and observation was the eastern end of Cook&#x27;s Beach, near the Purangi estuary. A smaller memorial plinth was established there also.

The brig &quot;Trial&quot; and the schooner &quot;Brothers&quot; were attacked by Māori on 20 August 1815 in Mercury Bay, when several sailors were killed. The bay was the resting place of HMS &quot;Buffalo&quot;, a ship that transported passengers and prisoners to Australia that was wrecked in a storm in 1840.

The mouth of Mercury Bay is ten kilometres across, and its coastline extends some 20 km. On the shore of the bay is the resort town of Whitianga, and a natural harbour is formed by an arm of the bay which extends inland a further six kilometres southward. Several small islets are located at the southern and northern extremities of the bay, and the Mercury Islands are 10 km to the north. The Whanganui A Hei (Cathedral Cove) Marine Reserve is in the southern part of the bay.

Named locations along Mercury Bay include Buffalo Beach, Wharekaho, Ferry Landing, Shakespeare Cliff, Lonely Bay, Flaxmill Bay, Cooks Beach, Purangi Estuary, Cathedral Cove and Hahei.

Mercury Bay is a good location for game fishing, with the Mercury Bay Game Fishing Club being one of the largest in New Zealand. The bay is also widely known for its yachting. The Mercury Bay Boating Club in Whitianga was the challenging club in New Zealand&#x27;s first challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup, in 1987.

There was an arched rock in Mercury Bay which collapsed. It was illustrated in the 1700s aboard James Cook&#x27;s Endeavour. It was depicted with a pā on top of the rock.

<doc id="1178032" wikidata="Q7231582" url="?curid=1178032" title="Porter-Gaud School">
<text>The Porter-Gaud School is an independent coeducational college preparatory day school in Charleston, in the U.S. state of South Carolina. Porter-Gaud has an enrollment of some 1100 students, comprising a lower school, middle school, and high school, and is located on the banks of the Ashley River. The school has historic ties to the Episcopal Church.

Porter-Gaud was formed in July 1964 from the merger of three schools: the Porter Military Academy (founded 1867), the Gaud School for Boys (founded 1908), and the Watt School (founded 1931). The legal name of the institution remains The Porter Academy.

The Porter Military Academy was formed in 1867 by the Rev. Anthony Toomer Porter, an Episcopal priest, to educate boys orphaned during the Civil War. Established on the scholastic philosophy of William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796–1877) as the Holy Communion Church Institute in 1867, the school was later known as Porter Academy and eventually Porter Military Academy. Porter hired John Gadsden as the academic principal. Gadsden was prepared in Muhlenberg&#x27;s famous school on Long Island and brought his successful principles to the new school in his hometown of Charleston. 

William Steen Gaud established the Gaud School in 1908. In 1948, Berkeley Grimball purchased the school from Gaud and over the course of 16 years increased the enrollment to nearly 150 as the Gaud School attained a position of eminence among Southern preparatory schools. Ann Carson Elliott, Berkeley Grimball&#x27;s mother, founded the Watt School in 1931, a coeducational primary school, which served as a feeder school for the Gaud School.

In 1964, the original Porter Military Academy campus in downtown Charleston was sold to the Medical University of South Carolina, and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (now CSX) donated the current 88-acre (360,000 m2) campus on Albemarle Point. In July 1964, the three schools merged and dropped the military program. The new entity, Porter-Gaud School, opened its doors to 435 male students in grades 1–12. As modern school facilities began taking shape across the Ashley River on the property donated by the railroad, classes met at the old Porter campus.

Porter-Gaud opened its new campus in September 1965 with an enrollment of 469 day students. In the following year it became one of the first schools in the South to adopt an open admissions policy. In 1972, the school admitted female students into the first three grades. By the fall of 1975 the program had been accelerated to include girls at all levels of the school, although Porter-Gaud has retained close ties to its sister school, Ashley Hall.

In May 2008, Porter-Gaud acquired The O&#x27;Quinn Schools, a local preschool that dates back to the early 1970s, with the intention of maintaining the names of the schools, faculties, programs, and tuition policies.

Porter-Gaud School graduates an average class size of 100 per year.

Porter-Gaud School is a member of the South Carolina Independent School Association, and Porter-Gaud offers over 38 varsity and junior varsity sports. The school athletic nickname is the Cyclone.

== Porter Military Academy ==
On October 25, 1867, while in Magnolia Cemetery, mourning the death of one of his sons, Anthony Toomer Porter, rector of Holy Communion Church, became convinced that he should start a school. Many of his son&#x27;s friends could no longer attend school, as their families had been impoverished by the war. By December of that year, Porter had founded the Holy Communion Church Institute, using church facilities.

In 1879 the old Federal Arsenal on Ashley Avenue, a block from the church, was put up for sale. Porter went to Washington and secured the help of President Hayes and Gen. Sherman (Porter had saved the life of an Officer in Sherman&#x27;s army during the war) to convince Congress to lease the property to the school for $1.00 a year.

Adapting the military buildings to school use, it was fitting that the school became known as Porter Military Academy. Both boarding school and day school, students came from towns and farms throughout the Low Country, and eventually from upper South Carolina, other states, and even other countries. From its beginning, the school accepted students from all faiths. It was and is affiliated with the Episcopal Church, but is owned by its Board of Trustees, with the Bishop as an ex officio member. One of the primary goals of the school was, and is, character development, summarized in the motto on the PMA crest: WATCH: Words, Actions, Thoughts, Character, and Habits.

Porter developed a broad curriculum, ranging from Greek to woodworking to athletics. The school day began with bugle call, breakfast, and chapel. Facilities ranged from a dormitory, an infirmary, library, classroom buildings, rifle range, tennis courts, a parade ground, and the notorious &quot;bull ring&quot; where detention students were made to march. Porter Military Academy boasted a naval program, including several surplus Navy vessels. The &quot;Porter Navy&quot; was discontinued, however, after a fire destroyed the ships. Porter also claimed one of the first high school football teams, one of which in a 1913 scrimmage held the Citadel to a 0 to 0 score.

== The Gaud School for Boys ==
Gaud, born in Canada, had a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago, and had been headmaster of Lawrence Academy in Groton, Massachusetts. After marrying a Charleston woman, he founded the Gaud School in 1908 with 34 students. In 1912 he turned the school over to others in order to teach at Phillips Exeter and then to serve during World War I. He returned to Charleston in 1919 and again took over his school.

The school was first located in a building behind his home at 25 3/4 Legare Street, but in 1920 it relocated to 77 Church Street. From 1928 until 1941 and again from 1957 to 1961, the school was located at 90–92 East Bay Street on the corner of Adger&#x27;s Wharf. In 1949-50 there were some 20-25 students in three grades in a 1-room school on East Bay Street. The school was also located for a time at 77 Church Street and at 79–81 East Bay Street.

Upon Gaud&#x27;s return to Charleston in 1919, his school essentially became a place to prepare Charleston boys for successful entry into New England boarding schools. Its high academic standards meant that Gaud often had a waiting list of applicants. The number of his students ranged from ten to eighteen, and these were divided into two grade levels in his one schoolroom, one class studying while the other recited. After Watt&#x27;s school began in 1931, it was customary for boys to attend her school through the third grade, and then fit into Gaud&#x27;s school, which went through the eighth grade. Gaud let his students take a break in the school day and go to the nearby playground, where one of the games was called &quot;Gaud ball&quot; – rather like baseball without a bat.

In 1948 Gaud retired at age 82 and his equity in the school was purchased by Berkeley Grimball for $125.00. Grimball began to build his school, a grade at a time, until he had about 180 students. The building on East Bay Street became too small for the growing school. In 1961 Grimball bought the Rutledge mansion on Broad Street, where the students had classes until 1964. Grimball continued Gaud&#x27;s high academic standards, at first teaching many of the subjects himself. As the school grew, he added teachers such as Maurice McLaughlin, who taught Latin and Spanish; history teacher Rear Admiral (Ret.) R. Bentham Simmons, a survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor; French teacher Charles Winter, a refugee from Hungary; and Admiral Florence, who taught math. Grimball was a particularly fine teacher of literature and history. The school lacked athletic facilities, but Grimball at first used the East Bay Street playground, especially for touch football and for softball, at recess and for voluntary extra sports on Monday and Thursday afternoons, and later took boys out to practice on his tennis courts on James Island; soccer was also added to the activities.

== The Watt School ==
Mrs. Watt was Grimball&#x27;s mother, so running a school came naturally for him. After her husband died, she began her school in 1931 in the depth of the Great Depression. Her first classes were held in the dining room of her Broad Street home, but she had a small classroom building constructed at the rear of her property. The reputation of her school grew among her neighbors and among those living south of Broad Street. Many of her graduates went on to the Gaud School, particularly after Grimball became headmaster there. Most of the children walked to school and then walked home for the traditional 2:00 p.m. dinner. It was a homey and welcoming school and very &quot;Charlestonian.&quot;

== The O&#x27;Quinn Schools ==
Founded in the early 1970s by Linda O&#x27;Quinn and her daughter Anna, the pre-school quickly became known for its personality and southern charm. The school quickly rose to prominence as the regions major feeder for many private schools and expanded to a second campus. Today the O&#x27;Quinn School is an important part of Porter-Gaud, maintaining two campuses on James Island and in Mt. Pleasant.

== Heads of School ==
== Sexual misconduct scandal ==
From 1972 to the early 1980s, physical science teacher and athletic advisor Eddie Fischer sexually abused at least twenty students at Porter-Gaud and nineteen at other Charleston, SC schools. In 1982, in response to complaints about Fischer&#x27;s sexual behavior, the administration of Porter-Gaud asked Fischer to resign. Both Principal James Bishop Alexander and Headmaster Berkeley Grimball then helped Fischer to get a job at another private school, where he continued to abuse. In April 1999, Fischer was sentenced to twenty years in prison for thirteen sexual-abuse charges.
In October 2000, following Fischer&#x27;s incarceration, a court determined that former Principal James Bishop Alexander and Headmaster Berkeley Grimball knew of the ongoing abuse by Fischer. The jury deemed both negligent in stopping the abuse. Neither Principal Alexander nor Headmaster Grimball were ultimately convicted, as each died prior to the court concluding. However, the court awarded the plaintiffs $105 million.

The scandal was the subject of a 2018 documentary, &quot;What Haunts Us&quot;. The film suggests the suicides of six graduates of the 1979 class were due to the mental impact of being sexually abused by Fischer. The colluding culture of the school with board members ignoring persistent pleas to be heard by one victim, who wrote to all the board members who never responded or discussed it, revealed that these young victims were trapped within a culture where the surface of respectability had to be maintained at all costs. Porter-Gaud school did make a public apology but not to the victims themselves.

<doc id="1178035" wikidata="Q287028" url="?curid=1178035" title="Superstrat">
<text>Superstrat is a name for an electric guitar design that resembles a Fender Stratocaster but with differences that clearly distinguish it from a standard Stratocaster, usually to cater to a different playing-style. Differences typically include more-pointed, aggressive-looking body and neck-shapes with increased cutaways to facilitate access to the higher frets, an increased number of frets on the fingerboard, a contoured heel at the neck joint facilitating easier higher fret access, the usage of humbucking pickups, and locking vibrato systems, most commonly the Floyd Rose.

There is no formal definition of a superstrat; the categorization is still largely left to popular opinion and depends greatly on the artist(s) associated with a particular model and how it is marketed.

==History==

=== Origin in custom modifications ===
With the increased popularity of heavy metal music during the early 1980s, guitarists began seeking out guitars more suited to the new style, both in terms of looks (more-&quot;pointy&quot; aggressive designs) and playability (ease of playing and larger tone that sounds pleasant with hi-gain amplification). Guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Uli Jon Roth and Dave Murray had used Fender Stratocasters, but each had minor modifications made to their instrument to suit their individual playing style.

Ritchie Blackmore was one of the first to build a guitar with superstrat characteristics. Dissatisfied with the performance of then-available original stock model commercial guitars, Blackmore sought to create a hybrid instrument that would suit his acrobatic playing style as seen in Deep Purple concert photos from Manchester in 1974.

Eddie Van Halen was another pioneer of the idea. The stock single-coil pickups of a Fender Stratocaster were noisy, and lacked the output necessary to drive an amplifier into hard distortion (characteristic of the Van Halen sound), but the body shape and wide pitch range of the Fender fulcrum tremolo appealed to him. An avid tinkerer, Van Halen assembled a Boogie Bodies Stratocaster body with a thin, 21-fret maple neck and a humbucking Gibson PAF pickup in the bridge slot. This guitar, known as the &quot;Frankenstrat&quot; was featured on Van Halen&#x27;s 1978 debut album &quot;Van Halen&quot;, and pictured on the album cover. It was later repainted with a top coat of red, and has had different humbuckers over the years, some of them custom-wound.

While many believe Van Halen&#x27;s 1977 Frankenstrat to be the first Superstrat, Michael Hampton of Parliament-Funkadelic often used a sunburst Stratocaster with 3 humbucking pickups and a reversed headstock during the band&#x27;s tours in the mid-to-late 1970s. This guitar can be seen on the DVD 
&quot;George Clinton: The Mothership Connection&quot;, which was filmed in 1976.

Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead had played various Stratocasters through the 1960s and early 70s, most notably an ash 1957 Strat given to him by Graham Nash and heavily modified by Alembic Sound. He commissioned Doug Irwin to make him several unique custom instruments, all with Strat-like features and control layouts. The first incarnation of the &quot;Wolf&quot; guitar had Stratocaster pickups mounted in a brass plate that allowed for any pickup combinations.

Soon, other guitarists and luthiers would also apply similar custom modifications to their instruments. Many sources cite Grover Jackson as one of the first (and most influential) guitar makers to have crafted custom shop guitars with all the features of superstrats, doing so as early as 1981. Later all these improvements were integrated in the factory-produced Jackson Soloist model.

=== Mass-production===
Starting about 1983-1984, companies such as Kramer, Jackson, Charvel, Yamaha, ,Cort, Aria, Ibanez, Washburn, and Hamer started mass-production of superstrat-design guitars due to growing market demand. The rising popularity of heavy metal music led to a new generation of guitarists that employed fast and complex techniques which demanded thinner and more versatile guitar necks and stable tremolo systems. Some examples of guitars marketed to this specific audience include:

* Kramer Baretta (1983-1991) - an early guitar with Floyd Rose, one slanted humbucker, but more traditional neck and body contours. Baretta has a close connection to Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s Frankenstrat - it was designed to be marketed as Van Halen&#x27;s signature model, but Eddie never endorsed the Baretta in terms of playing it on stage.
* Dean Bel Aire (1983-1984) - an early HSS guitar dubbed &quot;superstrat&quot;, despite still using bolt-on neck construction with 22 frets and vintage tremolo).
* Jackson Soloist (officially-produced starting August 28, 1984) - HSS guitar with neck-through construction, 24 frets, and Floyd Rose/Kahler bridge - the fullest embodiment of Superstrat features to date in a mass-produced guitar, considered by many the first &quot;definitive&quot; superstrat.

During the rest of the 1980s, due to the style&#x27;s huge marketing success, most guitar companies had at least one model of superstrat in mass production.

Makers of superstrat models besides the companies mentioned elsewhere in this article also included Fernandes, Schecter, Carvin and ESP.

===Fender&#x27;s response===

Fender responded to the superstrat fashion in the mid-1980s, producing a number of models based on the standard Stratocaster.

* Fender Contemporary Stratocaster Japan (1984-1987)
* Fender Performer (1985-1986)
* Fender HM Strat (1988-1992)
* Fender Prodigy (1991-1993)
* Fender Showmaster (1998-2009)

Fender also released several superstrat models, such as Talon, under Fender/Heartfield name from 1989 to 1993.

===Gibson&#x27;s response===
Gibson also produced some models inspired by the superstrat:
* Gibson Victory (1981-1983)
* Gibson WRC (1985-1986) - an early and rare Wayne Charvel model, a line of guitar manufactured exclusively by Wayne Charvel and branded as Gibson.
* Gibson US-1 (1986-1991) - first Gibson mass-manufactured try at the superstrat market
* Gibson U-2 (1987-1992) - second Gibson&#x27;s superstrat, a somewhat stripped-down version of US-1, featuring basswood body without a figured top, dot inlays, and regular pickups.
* Gibson Q series
* Gibson M-III (1991-1994; reissued 2013)

=== End of superstrat era ===
In early and mid-1990s, heavy metal and particularly shredding declined in popularity, in favor of grunge, nu metal, alternative metal, and other styles. The popularity of superstrats also declined, in favor of guitars more suited to these new styles. Companies that relied on superstrats as a major part of their target market suffered heavy losses and went out of business or were bought by larger corporations:
* Guild exited the solid-body guitar business in 1988 and was acquired by Fender in 1995.
* Hamer was acquired by Kaman Music Corporation in 1988, which in turn was acquired by Fender in 2008. , Hamer reduced their superstrat selection to just one model, the &quot;Californian&quot;.
* Dean was sold to Tropical Music in 1990. Superstrat production was resumed by its new owner in Korea.
* Kramer went bankrupt in 1990 and was sold to Gibson in the early 1990s.
* The Jackson and Charvel brands were bought by Fender in 2002.
* Ibanez suffered heavy losses in 1991-1993 and had to undergo a major restructuring of its model-lineup, adding such series as the GR (&quot;Ghostrider&quot;), Blazer, TC (&quot;Talman&quot;), RT (&quot;Retro&quot;) guitars, TR (&quot;Traditional&quot;), and ATK basses. The older Iceman model and Gibraltar bridge were resurrected as part of the new &quot;vintage&quot; theme. This restructuring kept the company afloat, tweaking its image from a &quot;metal-guitar-only company&quot; to a more customer-appealing one.

Nevertheless, extended-fretboard superstrats remain popular among metal and shred guitarists in particular, and are produced by guitar manufacturers of all sizes. Additionally, some Stratocaster modifications which were strongly associated with the superstrat, such as the Floyd Rose tremolo system and especially the inclusion of humbucking pickups, have become widely available from stock on 22-fret bolt-on neck instruments which are often seen as Stratocaster variants rather than superstrats, including several stock models of official Fender Stratocaster. A Fender Stratocaster mounted with at least one humbucking pickup (usually a single humbucker replacing the bridge pickup) is often called a &quot;Fat Strat.&quot; The available Fat Strat configurations as of 2018 are HSS (all models including both Fender and Squier), HSH (Player and MIM Deluxe only) and HH (Fender Player and Squier Contemporary). Modern solid-body electric guitars with seven, eight or more strings often show strong influence from the superstrat (such as extended fretboards, humbucking pickups, rear routs and/or locking tremoloes alongside a Stratocaster-influenced body shape) or could be regarded as superstrats themselves: for example, the Ibanez Universe, the first mass-produced solid-body seven-string guitar, closely resembles the Ibanez JEM.

<text>Infinity Within is the second studio album by American house and club/dance group Deee-Lite. Released in 1992 on Elektra, the second album, through its lyrical content, instrumentation, and overall tone, showcases the band&#x27;s political activism as a more literal part of the music than on their debut album, &quot;World Clique&quot; (1990).

&quot;Runaway&quot;, the lead single from the album, is Deee-Lite&#x27;s fourth single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dance/Club Play&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; helping to establish their success in the musical genre beyond &quot;World Clique&quot;.

==Album description==
With its predecessor subtly focusing on global peace, joy, and unity, &quot;Infinity Within&quot; is overtly political, as evidenced by the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s a pro-choice album&quot; appearing on the album cover and more importantly, with outspoken tracks encouraging the protection of the environment (&quot;I Had a Dream I Was Falling through a Hole in the Ozone Layer&quot;), sexual liberation through safe sex (&quot;Rubber Lover&quot;), the failure of the judicial system (&quot;Fuddy Duddy Judge&quot;) and the importance of voting (&quot;Vote, Baby, Vote&quot;). The song &quot;Vote, Baby, Vote&quot; was made into a public service announcement which advocated the band&#x27;s mission for voter registration and their support of the Motor Voter Bill to ease voter registration.

While some music critics may not have recognized it, the move to more heightened social awareness on the second album was not a departure from &quot;World Clique&quot;, but a natural progression for the band members. Inspired by the I Ching, &quot;Infinity Within&quot; is meant to be more self-reflective and to counteract the global view of &quot;World Clique&quot;, which lead singer Lady Kier felt was often misunderstood. She explained the idea behind the album and its title by saying: 

To further show their support of the environment, Deee-Lite pledged a portion of the album&#x27;s profits to Greenpeace. Additionally, &quot;Infinity Within&quot; was the first Warner Music titles that was issued in an eco-friendly package called the Eco-pak. It was designed in 1991 by Ivy Hill Packaging, at the time a subsidiary of Time Warner, as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the longbox which was often discarded after purchase, and to facilitate proper display of CDs in music retail stores. The eco-pack was displayed in stores unfolded, to display titles in the same manner as longboxes. Upon purchasing a title and removing the plastic shrink wrap, the packaging was folded into the shape of a traditional CD jewel case, similar to a Digipak. By 1993, the use of the longbox was phased out as music retailers began replacing LP-sized sales racks with those to house jewelcase or digipak formats with the locking plastic frames (keepers); thus rendering the Eco-pak, in its original form, obsolete. As a result, &quot;Infinity Within&quot; is among the few titles ever released with the original Eco-pak design.

==Reception==

The album generally received mixed reviews. Despite a lukewarm response, Robert Christgau gave the album a very positive 3-star honorable mention. 

Joe Brown from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Out to prove they&#x27;re not just cartoon characters or paper dolls, the retro-Hollywood styled Lady Miss Kier Kirby, Super DJ Dmitry Brill and Jungle DJ Towa &quot;Towa&quot; Tei try for some substance with their style this time out, interlacing the strained zaniness with messages (&quot;Let&#x27;s face it! It&#x27;s a pro-choice album!&quot; says the cover). Their concerns are similar to those of the B-52&#x27;s: safer sex, environmental destruction, voter registration and extraterrestrial contacts. As for the music, recycling is the order of the day - while there&#x27;s nothing as instantly infectious as &quot;Groove is in the Heart&quot;, the band&#x27;s blend of house Lite, R&amp;B and eclectic sampling is more consistent, and the deceptively slight melodic hooks of &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Heart Be Still&quot; prove infuriatingly tenacious. Kier has developed into a more confident, relaxed singer, and the DJs (plus cameos by bassist Bootsy Collins, hot rap outfit Arrested Development and several ex-JBs) provide perfect music for runway walking or Stairmaster stepping.&quot;

==Singles==
&quot;Infinity Within&quot; yielded three commercial singles the year of its release. The first single, &quot;Runaway&quot;, was released onto CD, cassette, and 12&quot; vinyl in May 1992, three weeks prior to the album&#x27;s debut. &quot;Runaway&quot; went on to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart, making it Deee-Lite&#x27;s fourth song to reach #1 on that chart. The commercial release of &quot;Runaway&quot;, which was paired with the song &quot;Rubber Lover&quot;, went on to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Single Sales chart as well. The single was accompanied by a music video directed by Gus Van Sant, which received modest airplay from MTV. &quot;Runaway&quot; is the only single from &quot;Infinity Within&quot; for which a music video was produced.

&quot;Thank You Everyday&quot;, the second single from the album, was released onto CD and 12&quot; vinyl in September 1992. The single failed to chart. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Pussycat Meow&quot;, was released solely onto 12&quot; vinyl in November 1992. The single climbed to #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance charts and #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Sales charts. A promotional CD single of &quot;I Had a Dream I was Falling Through a Hole in the Ozone Layer&quot; was released, but no commercial single was.

Aside from the success of &quot;Runaway&quot; on the dance chart, overall the three singles did not have as much impact as those released from &quot;World Clique&quot;. As such, none of the singles from &quot;Infinity Within&quot; managed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<doc id="1178042" wikidata="Q769504" url="?curid=1178042" title="No Doubt (No Doubt album)">
<text>No Doubt is the debut studio album by American rock band No Doubt, released on March 17, 1992, by Interscope Records. It was originally recorded as an independent release, but was re-recorded after the band signed with Interscope. It was produced by Dito Godwin and recorded in Los Angeles.

The album was released during a period of popularity for grunge music, an aggressive rock style which contrasted with No Doubt&#x27;s upbeat sound. Despite strong audience reaction to the band&#x27;s tours, album sales under-performed expectations and sold about 30,000 copies, and received mixed reviews. Interscope refused to fund the release of a single from the album, so No Doubt released the single &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot; independently. 

The band independently released their second album &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; in 1995, which had a better commercial performance, selling 100,000 copies. Interscope then financed and supported their third album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; (1995).

== Background ==
John Spence, Eric Stefani, and Eric&#x27;s sister Gwen formed the band as Apple Core in 1986, having worked together at a local Dairy Queen. They played small gigs around the Orange County area, with Spence&#x27;s on-stage antics carrying its performances. Tony Kanal went to one of these early shows and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that nobody date her.

In December 1987, Spence committed suicide several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees. No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks with Alan Meade taking over vocals. When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer, while No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California. In early 1988, Tom Dumont left Rising, a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister, stating that local metal bands &quot;were into drinking, wearing Spandex&quot; but that he wanted to focus on music. He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band&#x27;s guitarist, adding a metal influence to its sound. Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as drummer the following year.

Impressed by the presence of stage diving at ska concerts and Gwen&#x27;s on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1991.

== Music ==

=== Production ===
In 1991, No Doubt were signed to Interscope Records, which was then a new label. The band had just finished recording an indie CD that they were going to release themselves. When they were signed by the record label, they decided to accept the offer to re-record the CD in a professional studio. However, they weren&#x27;t receiving any support that they expected:

The band spent less than $13,000 recording their debut album, featuring both songs written as long ago as 1987 and new songs written specifically for the disc. All of the band members continued going to school to finish their education while recording their debut album in a Los Angeles studio.

To promote their album, in the summer of 1992 the band went on two two-week tours of the Western area of the United States. In the fall, they embarked on a two-and-a-half month national tour. Because the album underperformed commercially, Interscope refused to support the tour, leaving the band to finance it themselves. They played alongside bands such as Rage Against the Machine, Ugly Kid Joe, Sublime, Dance Hall Crashers, 311, Public Enemy, Pato Banton and The Special Beat.

=== Singles ===
After the disappointing sales of &quot;No Doubt&quot;, Interscope declined to finance the release of a single from the record. Thus, the band self-financed the shooting of a video for the song &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot;, spending roughly $5,000 on it. The video got local airplay in Orange County but, despite the band&#x27;s hopes, it was never aired on either MTV or VH1, although it was played on MuchMusic in Canada. It failed to achieve status on any chart. In 2003 the song was released on No Doubt&#x27;s greatest hits compilation album &quot;The Singles 1992-2003&quot; and the video was released on the companion DVD of music videos, &quot;The Videos 1992-2003&quot;.

Within the booklet from &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; is a blurb on each song. The short paragraph on &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot; states:

The song is based on a poem that guitarist Tom Dumont wrote about addiction to television and how it can control one&#x27;s mind. 19.5degs described the song as &quot;skiffling&quot; and &quot;the weakest track [on &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;] in the way of singing, but [with] smart lyrics&quot;. Music OMH, however, described the song as a &quot;kooky, almost novelty single&quot; and CD Universe described the song as a &quot;rhythmic workout&quot;. Rhapsody, in a positive review, described it as &quot;one of the album&#x27;s highlights&quot; and AllMusic called it &quot;as exciting&quot; as two of No Doubt&#x27;s more successful singles, &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Just a Girl&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Significance ===
The group&#x27;s ska sound contrasted greatly with the popular music genre in the USA at the time, grunge music. The album was a commercial failure, with only 30,000 copies sold. In the words of the program director of KROQ, a Californian radio station on which it was one of the band&#x27;s driving ambitions to be played: &quot;It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio.&quot;

The lack of record company support frustrated the band and led the band to self-produce their next album, &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;, in a home-made studio, causing them to abandon the slick pop sound desired by Interscope for a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over three times as many as &quot;No Doubt&quot; sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.

The success of their third album, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, led to fans becoming interested in the band&#x27;s earlier albums, &quot;No Doubt&quot; and &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;, and many more copies of them were manufactured and sold. &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was re-released in October 1997 as part of the band&#x27;s back catalog and, by the summer of 1997, &quot;No Doubt&quot; had sold 250,000 copies.

=== Critical ===
Yahoo! Music reviewer, Bill Holdship, called the album &quot;a rather nondescript ska-pop effort&quot;. AllMusic gave the album a mixed review, calling it &quot;a polished production&quot;. It described the music on the album as &quot;pop-oriented&quot;, with &quot;new wave keyboards and punchy brass proving a foil to the basic ska framework&quot;, and complimented Gwen Stefani&#x27;s &quot;extroverted&quot; vocals. Rhapsody also gave the album a positive review, albeit retrospectively, calling it &quot;a far cry from the radio pop [the band] became known for&quot;. It described the music as &quot;bright, colorful, fun&quot; and Gwen Stefani&#x27;s vocals as &quot;strong&quot;.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal bicupola ( or ) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.

The gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola is one of five Johnson solids which are chiral, meaning that they have a &quot;left-handed&quot; and a &quot;right-handed&quot; form. In the illustration to the right, each square face on the bottom half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a square face above it and to the right. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each bottom square would be connected to a square face above it and to the left. The two chiral forms of are not considered different Johnson solids.

<text>Y Kant Tori Read is the debut and only studio album by American rock band of the same name, fronted by then-unknown singer and songwriter Tori Amos. It was released in 1988 by Atlantic Records.

==Background==
The band consisted of Amos, singer-pianist Kim Bullard, drummer Matt Sorum who later joined Guns N&#x27; Roses, as well as long-time Amos collaborator guitarist Steve Caton; other contributors included Richárd Bernard on bouzouki, and various session musicians. Due to the title, some critics believed the album was a solo project by a woman named &quot;Tori Read&quot;. This was compounded by the fact that Amos is billed simply as &quot;Tori&quot; in the liner notes.

Amos chose producer Joe Chiccarelli, having admired his work on other albums. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters:

&quot;[Tori Amos] had a very strong vision of what she wanted to do on her first album. And despite the lack of success of that album, it was an interesting process because she was very vocal and very passionate about how she wanted it to sound and what her influences were and the emotions she was trying to convey.&quot;

Although Amos had effectively disowned the album for many years, Chiccarelli has said that she was very happy with it at the time.

==Promotion and release==
The eponymous studio album was released in 1988 to dismal sales and the band broke up shortly after. Its lack of success and subsequent deletion has made it one of the most sought-after Tori Amos collectibles, fetching upwards of $1,000 in compact disc format in original longbox. At the height of Amos&#x27; career, vinyl copies would often sell for between $300–500 but, due to the decline of music collectibles and the heavy bootlegging of the album, they now frequently sell for between $50–80.

Because of the scarcity of legitimate copies of the album it has been heavily bootlegged, so much so that an extensive FAQ on the topic was created. Bootleg versions generally stem from one of the first editions to surface, on a foreign label called Pacific Records. These usually have six &quot;bonus tracks&quot; from later in Amos&#x27; career; &quot;Song for Eric&quot;, &quot;Ode to the Banana King (Part 1)&quot;, &quot;Happy Phantom&quot; (live), &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, &quot;The Happy Worker&quot; and &quot;Workers&quot;. Other editions, particularly one that surfaced in Germany, were issued to intentionally resemble the original and fool legitimate collectors.

The number on the spine of the original CD reads 81845-2. The majority of bootlegs list this number incorrectly because the stolen artwork is taken from the easier to find LP version of the release, which had a different release number.

 copies of the record are more desirable than promotionally issued copies. (The reverse is generally the case in music collectibles.) Because the record sold so poorly, the majority of commercially released copies were recalled, stamped with a gold promo stamp, and given a cut-out mark. Thus there are actually more promotional copies of the record than not.

Several singles were released to promote the album, though most promotionally and not commercially. &quot;The Big Picture&quot; was released as a 12&quot; vinyl promotional single with unique artwork; &quot;Cool on Your Island&quot; was issued as a 7&quot; vinyl promotional single with a special edit version of the song; it was also included as a B-side to a promotional CD featuring the song &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; by Phil Collins. (On &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, Amos told a story from this era of being stopped by police while traveling through Germany because her friend was carrying marijuana; when she told the police officer that she was &quot;on a CD with Phil Collins&quot; she was set free.)

One music video was produced, for the song &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, featuring Amos performing on a &quot;ghetto city&quot; sound stage set.

Amos has continued to play a select few songs from this album (&quot;On the Boundary&quot;, &quot;Etienne&quot;, &quot;Cool on Your Island&quot;, and snippets of &quot;Fire on the Side&quot;) live in concert. During the 2014 Unrepentant Geraldines tour, however, Amos played a full version of &quot;Fire on the Side&quot;, as well as &quot;Floating City&quot; and &quot;Pirates&quot;. &quot;The Big Picture&quot; and &quot;Fayth&quot; were performed as mashups with George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; and the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of You&quot; respectively. She has yet to perform &quot;Heart Attack at 23&quot; and &quot;You Go to My Head&quot; in any capacity.

In 2017, Amos said she had made peace with the album, and was considering reissuing it in the future. An entirely remastered edition of the album was discreetly released on all digital and streaming services for the first time on September 1, 2017, with no official announcement or promotion. This was followed by a limited physical re-release of the remastered album on CD and transparent orange vinyl by Rhino Records as part of International Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday exclusive releases on November 24, 2017. This also resulted in a one-week UK chart entry, at #6, on 06 Dec 2017.

<doc id="1178052" wikidata="Q1367306" url="?curid=1178052" title="Reliant Robin">
<text>The Reliant Robin is a small three-wheeled car produced by the Reliant Motor Company in Tamworth, England. It was offered in several versions (Mk1, Mk2 and Mk3) over a period of 30 years. It is the second-most popular fibreglass car in history after the Chevrolet Corvette, with Reliant being the second-biggest British car manufacturer for a time.

== History ==
=== Mk. 1 ===

The Robin was first manufactured in October 1973 as a direct replacement for the Reliant Regal. These models feature a 750 cc engine, but in 1975, the car gained a number of improvements including an engine boost to 850 cc. The Reliant Robin was well received in the 1970s because of good work executed by Ogle Design (who had previously designed the Bond Bug, and Reliant Scimitar) and affordable price, considering was possible, and orders increased with the 1970s fuel crisis. The final original version of the Robin rolled off the production line in 1982, and after a number of limited editions, including the GBS and the Jubilee, it was replaced by the restyled Reliant Rialto designed by IAD in Worthing, UK. The vehicle was also produced under licence in Greece by MEBEA between 1974 and 1978.
=== Mk. 2 ===

In 1989, Reliant revived the Robin name, producing a new and totally revamped Robin featuring a new fibreglass body featuring a hatchback, with later an estate and van joining the range. The Rialto continued in production alongside the new Robin until 1998 as purely a cheaper model in saloon, estate and van models also. Later on in production, the Robin received new, 12 inch wheels, improved brakes (from the original mini) and an improved interior with new dials and interior trim. Reliant also started offering an unleaded engine (shown by having a green rocker cover) which features hardened exhaust valve seats. As well as this, the new models joined the range with the LX, SLX, BRG, and Royale models. Royale and BRG models were top of the range and cost over £9,000. New colours such as metallic silver, British racing green, royal blue and NightFire red were used, along with a range of retro-style optional extras such as minilite alloy wheels and jaguar custom seat patterns, which then became available on all Robin models.

=== Mk. 3 ===

The Robin was redesigned in 1999, with the design executed by Andy Plumb, chief designer at Reliant at that time. This final version was launched boasting the biggest changes since the original launch, with completely new panels and Vauxhall Corsa front lamps. It was the first Robin to be designed with the use of a computer. An electric and a diesel version along with a pickup variant were conceptualised, but never made. A hatchback van was manufactured.

In 2000, it was announced the final Reliant Robin would be built after 65 limited editions were made. It was named the &quot;Reliant Robin 65&quot; and had a very high specification. All 65s had gold metallic paint, red and grey leather seats, red carpets, walnut dashboards, white dials, minilite alloy wheels, premium stereo systems, electronic ignitions and gold plaques on the dashboards which were individually numbered and bore the original owner&#x27;s engraved name. The selling price was £10,000. The last Reliant Robin produced was given away by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in a Valentine&#x27;s Day competition in 2001.

=== BN-1 and BN-2 ===
Manufacturing of the Robin resumed under licence by B&amp;N Plastics in July 2001. This firm was allowed to produce 250 cars a year, but it was stalled by problems and production faults and went into financial trouble after producing just 40 or so complete cars up to October 2002.

The BN-1 Robin was based on the Robin 65 limited edition, and featured all the expensive extras but with a more modern feature set. The car had a completely redesigned interior, with a new dashboard and interior in black. The body also received some under-the-skin features, including integrated fibreglass skims for the door hinges and a new whole-body fabrication process, which resulted in reduced weight. The revised car was reapproved, so that it was legal for sale in the UK.

The BN-2 Robin was a higher specification model, featuring higher-grade materials for the interior, a custom metallic paint finish, a radio-CD (instead of radio-cassette) and front electric windows, a first for the Robin.

=== General specifications ===
The single wheel in the front is responsible for the steering, while the engine (also in the front) drives the rear axle. The Reliant Robin aimed to provide economical and predictable personal transport. The 850 cc engine gives an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in 14 seconds and a top speed of 85 mph, they also give a very good economy figure of up to 70 mpg; the later Mk3 Reliant Robin was quoted to give 60 to 100 mpg.

=== Licence requirements ===
Despite its size, by being a three-wheeler with an official mass below , the Robin could traditionally be driven by holders of a B1 category driving licence in the United Kingdom, and registered and taxed at motorcycle rates, which gave a saving of £55 a year over a conventional car. Up until 2001, the B1 licence entitlement was given to those who passed the category A motorcycle test, leading to the common misconception that people could drive a Robin on a motorcycle licence. Those passing their motorcycle test after 2001 could not drive a Robin, until the law changed in December 2012. As of 29 December 2012, tricycles such as the Robin no longer fall within the B1 category licence; in-line with European Union law, tricycles are now classified under the category A &quot;motorcycle licence&quot;. As such, any person holding a &quot;full motorcycle licence&quot; may legally drive a Robin. As it was not the licence entitlement that changed, but rather the categorisation of tricycles into an existing category, the change applies to all holders of category A motorcycle licences, whenever they were obtained. Shortly after this an oversight was that a person with a full car licence could no longer drive a three-wheeled vehicle; this was then altered by the UK government after car companies which produce three-wheeled vehicles (such as Morgan) protested over the licensing changes, this resulted in car licence holders now being able to drive a three-wheeled vehicle, but an age limit of 21 was also added; this 21 or over age limit also applies to motorcycle category A licence holders.

Originally, it was possible to drive a three-wheeled Reliant with a motorcycle permit, as a full motorcycle permit included a B1 class endorsement, which gave a driver the right to drive vehicles with three or four wheels of up to 550 kg (10¾ cwt). However, the DVLA ceased to issue the B1 endorsement in 2001.

Interest in the Reliant increased once more after January 2013, when the licensing scheme was changed once again. From 2013, a holder of a full category A motorcycle licence over the age of 21 may drive a three-wheeled vehicle of any power. This age restriction applies to full Category B holders also. In a further change in 2014, the UK government created a new descriptor &quot;motor tricycles with power output over 15kW&quot; within the top-level category A (including its related driver age restriction of 21 years), into which the Reliant 3 wheeler range fits.

Because of these licensing changes, a Reliant Robin cannot be driven with a provisional licence; unless the driver meets certain disability criteria.

== In popular culture ==
Miss Shepherd owned one Reliant Robin in &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot;, a 1989 book, 1999 play and 2015 film by Alan Bennett, a real-life portrayal of a case of Diógenes syndrome.

The British sitcom series Mr. Bean (1990-1995) starring Rowan Atkinson has a running gag with a blue Reliant Robin getting into a variety of mishaps- usually regarding Mr. Bean&#x27;s mini car.

The 2011 Disney film &quot;Cars 2&quot; features a French character named Tomber who is patterned on a Reliant Regal saloon car, though he also has been compared to a Robin. His name means &quot;falling&quot; in French, referencing the instability of three-wheel vehicles.

The 2018 music video for Rick Astley&#x27;s &quot;She Makes Me&quot;, from the album &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; prominently features a yellow Reliant Rialto.

In both the 1990 novel by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett and the TV series released in 2019, the Reliant Robin makes an appearance in &quot;Good Omens.&quot; The character Pulsifer Newton (in series 1) drives the vehicle, which he names Dick Turpin. 

=== &quot;Top Gear&quot; ===

On 18 February 2007 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; (series 9, episode 4), a Reliant Robin was used by Richard Hammond and James May in an attempt to modify a normal K-reg Robin into a reusable Space Shuttle. The booster rockets separated cleanly, but the fuel tank did not detach, and the Robin crashed into the ground, where it promptly exploded. This launch was the &quot;largest non-commercial rocket launch in European history&quot;.

In a subsequent episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; (series 15, episode 1), a modified 1994 Reliant Robin was used by Jeremy Clarkson to drive 14 miles from Sheffield to Rotherham. He described driving it as dangerous as &quot;inviting your mum &#x27;round for an evening on chatroulette&quot;, and that the Robin &quot;wasn&#x27;t funny, it was a complete menace&quot;. During the segment, Clarkson rolled a specially side-weighted Robin at least six times. The following two episodes featured racing driver The Stig and Ken Block on their test track in Robins, and neither of them could finish a clean lap in the specially doctored Robin. Later on, Clarkson admitted that the Robin used in the show had the differential modified to allow &quot;the poor little thing&quot; to roll over easily. The car also had unequal sized wheels fitted creating an imbalance toward the driver&#x27;s side.

<doc id="1178059" wikidata="Q4348088" url="?curid=1178059" title="1958 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1958 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate which occurred in the middle of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s second term. Thirty-two seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, the new state of Alaska held its first Senate elections for its Class 2 and 3 seats, and two special elections were held to fill vacancies.

As is common in mid-term elections, the party in the White House lost seats, but losses this year were heavy due to the Recession of 1958, the Eisenhower Administration&#x27;s position on right-to-work issues that galvanized labor unions which supported Democrats, and the launch of Sputnik. This was the first time since 1934 that Democrats gained seats in this class of Senators. Democrats won both seats in West Virginia, making the last time that Democrats simultaneously flipped both of a state&#x27;s Senate seats until Georgia&#x27;s elections in 2020 and 2021.

The Democratic Party gained a record 15 seats in this election, defeating 10 Republican incumbents, gaining three open Republican seats, and winning both seats from the new state of Alaska. This gave the Democrats a strong Senate majority of 64–34 over the Republicans, and the largest swing in the history of the Senate. After the new state of Hawaii elected its first Senators in 1959, the Senate&#x27;s balance changed to 65–35.

This is only one of two occasions in U.S. history that 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in a mid-term election (the other being in 1946), and also one of five occasions where 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in an election, with the other occasions being in 1920, 1932, 1946, and 1980.

== Race summaries ==

=== Special / new state elections ===
In the special elections, the winners were seated during 1958 or before January 3, 1959. In the new state elections, the winners were seated with the new Congress on January 3, 1959. Ordered by election date.

=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these regular elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1959; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 1 seats.

== Closest races ==
Eleven races had a margin of victory under 10%:

Maine was the tipping point state with a margin of 21.6%.

== Alaska ==

Alaska would become a new state January 3, 1959, and it elected two initial senators November 25, 1958, in advance of statehood. The Democratic Party thereby picked up 2 more seats.

In their next elections, Alaska&#x27;s senators would be elected to 6-year terms.
The class 2 race, for the 2-year term ending in 1961, was between the Democratic incumbent territorial delegate Bob Bartlett, and the Republican Juneau attorney R. E. Robertson.



Bartlett would be re-elected twice and serve until his death in 1968.

The class 3 race, for the 4-year term ending in 1963, pitted two former territorial governors, Democrat Ernest Gruening against Republican Mike Stepovich. Gruening won a close race.



Gruening would be re-elected in 1962 and serve until losing renomination in 1968.
== Arizona ==





== California ==






== Connecticut ==


In Connecticut, Democrat Thomas J. Dodd defeated incumbent senator William A. Purtell who ran for a second term.





== Delaware ==

Two-term Republican John J. Williams was re-elected to a third term.



Williams would be re-elected in 1964, serving four terms until his 1970 retirement.
== Florida ==


Incumbent Democrat Senator Holland, a conservative, was challenged by former senator Claude Pepper, who had been unseated in 1950. Holland had played a role in recruiting George A. Smathers to run against the liberal Pepper in that election. The two served as colleagues in the Senate from 1947 to 1951.






== Indiana ==


Incumbent Republican William E. Jenner did not seek a second full term in office and was replaced by Democrat Vance Hartke, the mayor of Evansville. Hartke defeated incumbent Republican Governor of Indiana Harold W. Handley.

Jenner resigned shortly before the election and urged Handley, Jenner&#x27;s political protégé, to seek his seat. A plan was proposed whereby Handley would resign the governorship, his lieutenant would appoint him senator, and he would finish the term and run as an incumbent. When the plan was revealed to the party leadership, they strongly advised him to not implement it because they feared it would hurt the party and be perceived as a scandal.

Handley did not resign from the governorship during his campaign and was widely criticized for the unprecedented action. Hartke accused Handley of raising taxes, breaking of his campaign promise, his reluctance in supporting right-to-work, and rising state unemployment. Statewide unemployment was just above 10% in April, but dropped to 6.9% by the end of September.



== Maine ==

Maine held its election September 8, 1958, in keeping with its routine practice of holding elections before the November national Election Day. Democrat Edmund Muskie defeated one-term Republican incumbent, Frederick G. Payne by a wide margin, 61–39%.



== Maryland ==




== Massachusetts ==






== Michigan ==





== Minnesota ==


In Minnesota, Democratic Representative Eugene McCarthy defeated incumbent senator Edward John Thye who ran for a third term.









== Mississippi ==

Two-term Democrat John C. Stennis was re-elected with no opposition.

Stennis would be re-elected four more times, serving until his retirement in 1989.
== Missouri ==


Incumbent Democrat Stuart Symington was re-elected to a second term. Hazel Palmer was the first woman ever nominated for United States senator in Missouri.








== Montana ==

Incumbent Mike Mansfield, who was first elected to the Senate in 1952, ran for re-election. Mansfield won the Democratic primary comfortably, and moved on to the general election, where he was opposed by Lou W. Welch, a millworker and the Republican nominee. In contrast to the close campaign in 1952, Mansfield defeated Welch in a landslide and won his second term in the Senate easily.








== Nebraska ==

Republican Roman Hruska had won a 1954 special election and ran for a full term. He beat Democratic attorney Frank B. Morrison, who had previously lost his challenger bid for Nebraska&#x27;s 1st congressional district.







Hruska would be re-elected two more times and serve until his 1976 retirement.

Morrison would be elected Governor of Nebraska in 1960 and serve there for six years from 1961 to 1967, and was re-elected twice while running unsuccessfully for U.S. senator.

== Nevada ==

In Nevada, incumbent Republican George W. Malone ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Democrat Howard Cannon.

The campaign was considered one of the most competitive and highly watched in the nation in 1958. Senator Malone was known nationally as a leader within the Republican Party&#x27;s right wing and held key appointments on the Senate Finance and Interior Committees.

Malone campaigned on his experience and seniority in the Senate, using the slogan &quot;He Knows Nevada Best.&quot; He received support from Eisenhower cabinet secretaries Fred Seaton and Ezra Taft Benson. Benson, one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, was especially influential among Nevada&#x27;s large Mormon population. His endorsement was seen as particularly important in light of Cannon&#x27;s Mormon faith. Late in the campaign, Malone published full-page ads touting his effort to save Nevada from a federal gambling tax.

Cannon focused his attacks on Malone&#x27;s absentee record in the Senate and his reputation on Capitol Hill as an unpopular extremist.

Cannon won the election by a safe margin owing to his overwhelming support in his native Clark County, which contained 47 percent of the state&#x27;s registered voters. He was the first candidate from southern Nevada elected to the United States Senate.



Senator Malone was unopposed for re-nomination by the Republican Party.



== New Jersey ==


Incumbent Republican H. Alexander Smith chose not to seek a third term in office. Democratic U.S. Representative Harrison Williams won the open seat over U.S. Representative Robert Kean.










== New Mexico ==




== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Irving Ives retired. Republican Representative Kenneth Keating defeated Democrat Frank Hogan to succeed Ives.







== North Carolina (special) ==

Democrat W. Kerr Scott had died April 16, 1958, and former Democratic Governor of North Carolina B. Everett Jordan was appointed April 19, 1958, to continue the term, pending a special election. Jordan was then re-elected in November.


Jordan would later be twice re-elected and serve until 1973.
== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican, and former Non-Partisan League (NPL) senator, William Langer, was re-elected to a fourth term, defeating North Dakota Democratic NPL Party (Dem-NPL) candidate Raymond G. Vendsel.

Only Langer filed as a Republican, and the endorsed Democratic-NPL candidate was Raymond G. Vendsel. Langer and Vendsel won the primary elections for their respective parties.

Two independent candidates, Arthur C. Townley and Custer Solem, also filed before the deadline but had minimal impact on the outcome of the election, totaling less than 3,000 votes combined. Townley was known as the creator of the National Non-Partisan League, and had previously sought North Dakota&#x27;s other senate seat in 1956.




Langer would die in office less than a year into what became his final term. A special election was held in 1960 triggered by Langer&#x27;s death.

== Ohio ==

Incumbent Republican John W. Bricker was defeated in his bid for a third term by U.S. Representative Stephen M. Young.



== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Edward Martin did not seek re-election. The Republican nominee, Hugh Scott, defeated the term-limited Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania George M. Leader for the vacant seat.




Scott would be twice re-elected, rising to the Senate Minority leader, and serve until retiring in 1977. Leader retired from public service after the defeat.
== Rhode Island ==

Two-term incumbent Democrat John Pastore was easily re-elected over Republican attorney Bayard Ewing, a repeat of their 1952 race.



Ewing would later serve as the national chairman of the United Way (1969–1972) and the Rhode Island School of Design (1967–1985).
== Tennessee ==




== Texas ==





== Utah ==





== Vermont ==

Incumbent Republican Ralph Flanders did not run for re-election to another term in the United States Senate. Republican candidate Winston L. Prouty defeated Democratic candidate Frederick J. Fayette to succeed him.








== Virginia ==

Incumbent Harry F. Byrd Sr. was re-elected after defeating Independent Louise Wensel and Social Democrat Clarke Robb.




== Washington ==






== West Virginia ==
=== West Virginia (regular) ===

In 1956, senator Harley M. Kilgore died, and former senator William Revercomb won his seat in the 1956 special election. Revercomb sought re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Congressman Robert Byrd. This election was the beginning of Byrd&#x27;s lifelong career in the Senate.




=== West Virginia (special) ===
Incumbent Democrat Matthew M. Neely died of cancer January 8, 1958, and Republican John D. Hoblitzell Jr. was appointed January 25, 1958, to continue the term, pending a special election.

Former Democratic congressman Jennings Randolph was elected to finish the term that would run through 1961. 



Randolph would be re-elected four times and serve until his retirement in 1985. Hoblitzell resumed his business interests and died January 6, 1962.

<text>Stevenote is a colloquial term for keynote speeches given by Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, at events such as the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Macworld Expo, and Apple Expo. Because most Apple product releases were first shown to the public at these keynotes, &quot;Stevenotes&quot; caused substantial swings in Apple&#x27;s stock price.

The final Stevenote was delivered on June 6, 2011, when iCloud (Apple&#x27;s cloud computing service) was announced. OS X Lion and iOS 5 were also announced on the same day. It was one of Jobs&#x27; last public appearances before his resignation as CEO on August 24 and death on October 5 of that year.

==History==
In late 1996, Apple purchased NeXT, and Jobs returned to Apple after an 11-year hiatus following his forced resignation from the company in 1985. In mid-1997, he delivered a keynote address, with a detailed report on the company&#x27;s status, featuring a satellite appearance by Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Jobs announced a partnership with Microsoft with several key agreements which, according to him, would benefit Apple and allow it to recover from the prolonged decline of the early and mid-1990s. Two major announcements were made during the keynote: the next release of Microsoft Office (Office 98) would be developed for the Macintosh, and Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer would be the default web browser on Macintosh computers. Despite heckling from the audience, Jobs explained why the partnership was favorable to Apple:

Jobs later gave keynote addresses at trade expositions and conferences at least once a year, in which he announced updates to Apple products or demonstrated new products and services. Nearly every product upgrade or announcement in the next 13 years was made during a Stevenote. Among products so-announced were the original iMac all-in-one desktop computer in 1998, the clamshell iBook in 1999, the Mac OS X operating system in 2000, the iPod music player in 2001, the iPhone smartphone in 2007, and the iPad tablet in 2010.

== Format ==
Stevenote addresses have usually been given at major trade expos. In the past, these have included the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in San Francisco and Boston, and the Apple Expo in Paris. However, Apple has stopped exhibiting at both expos. After 2010, the Worldwide Developer&#x27;s Conference, organized and held by Apple itself at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, was the only major conference at which Apple exhibited and at which Jobs delivered a keynote address. In recent years, Jobs gave his Stevenotes in an auditorium at Apple&#x27;s corporate campus. These Stevenotes, in contrast to those presented at the large trade fairs attended by Apple in the past, were by invitation only and were attended only by a relatively small number of journalists, employees, and guests, and were called &quot;special events&quot; rather than keynotes. Similar Stevenotes have also been held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts like those for the introduction of the iPad in 2010 and Apple&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; iPod event in 2009.

Jobs was known for donning the same uniform in nearly every keynote since 1998. His outfit usually consisted of a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck by Issey Miyake, Levi&#x27;s 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.

==Notable Stevenotes==

===1998===
At the 1998 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote, Jobs announced that the company was back on track. He reviewed Apple&#x27;s inventory turnover rate, describing changes in its distribution system and apple.com, its online store. Jobs said that Apple had sold 500,000 Power Macintosh G3 in its first six months, described the PowerBook G3 and showed the &quot;Steamroller&quot; commercial. He claimed that there were 10 million Apple computers in consumer use and six million educational users, and discussed the iMac and QuickTime; Jobs said that the International Organization for Standardization adopted the QuickTime file format as the basis for MPEG 4. Jobs said that Apple would add Internet &quot;live&quot; streaming (Real-time Transport Protocol) to QuickTime 3.0 for its release in fall 1998 and introduced Peter Hoddie, chief architect of QuickTime. Jobs described three improvements Apple wanted to make to Java: unify the Java virtual machine, make it compatible and make it fast. He announced Apple&#x27;s strategy for Mac OS X, saying that the 6,000-plus good application programming interfaces (APIs) would be called Carbon (API), introducing Avadis Tevanian to demonstrate Carbon. Tevanian introduced Ben Waldman (general manager of the Macintosh unit at Microsoft), Norm Meyrowitz (president of Macromedia Products) and Greg Gilley (vice-president for graphics applications development at Adobe Systems), who demonstrated Photoshop. Jobs announced that the Mac OS 8 Codename Sonata would be released in the third quarter of 1999; Rhapsody 1.0 would be released in the third quarter of 1998.

===1999===
WWDC 1999 was opened by HAL9000. Jobs delivered an update, saying that 3,106 Mac apps were announced since May 6, 1998 (the debut date of iMac); Dragon Systems was bringing its voice-recognition software to the Mac, and he introduced Janet Baker (co-founder and CEO of Dragon Systems). Jobs updated Apple&#x27;s profits, units, inventory and cash, announcing that Sears would be added to its national distribution chain. Apple Inc. launched its store on Memorial Day 1999, and Jobs announced the PowerBook line. During the one-week conference, Apple gave away 50 PowerBooks to attending developers. Jobs delivered an update on OpenGL, Java and QuickTime, inviting Avie Tevanian and Phil Schiller onstage. Schiller demonstrated OpenGL, QuickTime 4, Sherlock 2, the Quartz graphics model, Finder and the MailViewer app. Jobs announced Java MRJ 2.1.2, the fastest Mac Java to date, and he and Tevanian demonstrated Java. He reviewed Mac OS 8.5 (released in October 1998), announced Mac OS 8.6, previewed Sonata (scheduled for release in fall 1999) and delivered an update on Mac OS X Server 1.0. Jobs said that in the Darwin open-source software program there were over 20,000 registered developers and over 175,000 component downloads, describing the three application environments on the Darwin-Quartz foundation. The first was Classic Environment (formerly named Blue Box); the second was Carbon (API) (announced at WWDC 1998), and the third was Cocoa (API) (formerly named Yellow Box). Apple was developing a new Finder and a new Mail.

At the August 31, 1999, Seybold Seminars Expo, Jobs delivered an update on Apple, announcing its June quarterly profits, the appointment of Mickey Drexler (of Gap Inc.) to the board of directors, and giving an overview of QuickTime. Apple partnered with Akamai Technologies as a broadcast network, with content provided by BBC News, Bloomberg Television, Fox News, Fox Sports, HBO, NPR, The Weather Channel, WGBH-TV, ABC News, ESPN, Rolling Stone, VH1, and Disney; new content was provided by Rhino Records and Warner Bros. Records. Phil Schiller demonstrated QuickTime TV, Sherlock 2, VoicePrint, AppleScript and the Power Mac G4, and Jobs previewed Mac OS 9. He demonstrated nine features: Sherlock 2, a shopping app; Multiple Users, with privacy and preferences for a number of users; VoicePrint Password, voice-recognition software; Keychain, with one password; Auto Updating, for the latest updates; Encryption, for private files; File Sharing Over Internet; AppleScript over TCP/IP, to manage workflow across computers, and Network Browser. Jobs reviewed the iMac, introducing Ozzie Osborne (general manager of speech systems at IBM) to demonstrate ViaVoice. Jobs reviewed iBook (showing two TV advertisements) AirPort (showing the AirPort Base Station TV ad), the PowerBook and the Power Mac G4, calling computer scientist Richard Crandall onstage to demonstrate the G4. Jobs introduced John Warnock, chairman and chief commercial officer (CCO) of Adobe Systems. Jobs showed a Power Mac G4 TV ad, and introduced the Apple Cinema Display.

On October 5, 1999, Jobs said that Akio Morita of Sony had died two days earlier, announced the Mac OS 9 and described the nine internet power tools. Phil Schiller demonstrated Sherlock 2, Multiple Users, VoicePrint Password, Keychain, Encryption, Network Browser and Auto Updating. Jobs reviewed the Power Mac G4, showed a TV ad, and reviewed the Apple Cinema Display, PowerBook, and iBook. He announced the new iMac, and Schiller demonstrated the graphics card. Jobs introduced and demonstrated the iMac DV and iMovie, and showed three TV commercials.

==&quot;One more thing...&quot;==

A typical Stevenote began with Jobs presenting sales figures for Apple products and a review of products released during the past few months. He then presented one or more new products. Reminiscent of Peter Falk&#x27;s &quot;Columbo&quot;, he typically feigned some concluding remarks, turned as if to leave the stage and turned back, saying &quot;But there&#x27;s one more thing&quot;.

<doc id="1178065" wikidata="Q1755504" url="?curid=1178065" title="Minimally invasive procedure">
<text>Minimally invasive procedures (also known as minimally invasive surgeries) encompass surgical techniques that limit the size of incisions needed, thereby reducing wound healing time, associated pain, and risk of infection. Surgery by definition is invasive, and many operations requiring incisions of some size are referred to as &quot;open surgery&quot;. Incisions made during open surgery can sometimes leave large wounds that may be painful and take a long time to heal. Advancements in medical technologies have enabled the development and regular use of minimally invasive procedures. For example, endovascular aneurysm repair, a minimally invasive surgery, has become the most common method of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms in the US as of 2003. The procedure involves much smaller incisions than the corresponding open surgery procedure of open aortic surgery.

Interventional radiologists were the forerunners of minimally invasive procedures. Using imaging techniques, radiologists were able to direct interventional instruments through the body by way of catheters instead of the large incisions needed in traditional surgery. As a result, many conditions once requiring surgery can now be treated non-surgically.

Diagnostic techniques that do not involve incisions, puncturing the skin, or the introduction of foreign objects or materials into the body are known as non-invasive procedures. Several treatment procedures are classified as non-invasive. A major example of a non-invasive alternative treatment to surgery is radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy.

== Medical uses ==

Minimally invasive procedures were pioneered by interventional radiologists who had first introduced angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent. Many other minimally invasive procedures have followed where images of all parts of the body can be obtained and used to direct interventional instruments by way of catheters (needles and fine tubes), so that many conditions once requiring open surgery can now be treated non-surgically. A minimally invasive procedure typically involves the use of arthroscopic (for joints and the spine) or laparoscopic devices and remote-control manipulation of instruments with indirect observation of the surgical field through an endoscope or large scale display panel, and is carried out through the skin or through a body cavity or anatomical opening. Interventional radiology now offers many techniques that avoid the need for surgery.

By use of a minimally invasive procedure, a patient may require only an adhesive bandage on the incision, rather than multiple stitches or staples to close a large incision. This usually results in less infection, a quicker recovery time and shorter hospital stays, or allow outpatient treatment. However, the safety and effectiveness of each procedure must be demonstrated with randomized controlled trials. The term was coined by John E. A. Wickham in 1984, who wrote of it in &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1987.

==Specific procedures==

Many medical procedures are called minimally invasive; those that involve small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted, end in the suffix &quot;-oscopy&quot;, such as endoscopy, laparoscopy, arthroscopy. Other examples of minimally invasive procedures include the use of hypodermic injection, and air-pressure injection, subdermal implants, refractive surgery, percutaneous surgery, cryosurgery, microsurgery, keyhole surgery, endovascular surgery using interventional radiology (such as angioplasty or embolization), coronary catheterization, permanent placement of spinal and brain electrodes, stereotactic surgery, the Nuss procedure, radioactivity-based medical imaging methods, such as gamma camera, positron emission tomography and SPECT (single photon emission tomography). Related procedures are image-guided surgery, and robot-assisted surgery.

== Equipment ==
Special medical equipment may be used, such as fiber optic cables, miniature video cameras and special surgical instruments handled via tubes inserted into the body through small openings in its surface. The images of the interior of the body are transmitted to an external video monitor and the surgeon has the possibility of making a diagnosis, visually identifying internal features and acting surgically on them.

==Benefits==
Minimally invasive surgery should have less operative trauma, other complications and adverse effects than an equivalent open surgery. It may be more or less expensive (for dental implants, a minimally invasive method reduces the cost of installed implants and shortens the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation time with four–six months). Operative time is longer, but hospitalization time is shorter. It causes less pain and scarring, speeds recovery, and reduces the incidence of post-surgical complications, such as adhesions and wound rupture. Some studies have compared heart surgery.

==Risks==
Risks and complications of minimally invasive procedures are the same as for any other surgical operation, among the risks are: death, bleeding, infection, organ injury, and thromboembolic disease.

There may be an increased risk of hypothermia and peritoneal trauma due to increased exposure to cold, dry gases during insufflation. The use of surgical humidification therapy, which is the use of heated and humidified CO2 for insufflation, may reduce this risk.

Sometimes the use of non-invasive methods is not an option, so that the next level of minimally invasive techniques are looked to. These include the use of hypodermic injection (using the syringe), an endoscope, percutaneous surgery which involves needle puncture of the skin, laparoscopic surgery commonly called &quot;keyhole surgery&quot;, a coronary catheter, angioplasty and stereotactic surgery.

=== Open surgery ===

&quot;Open surgery&quot; is any surgical procedure where the incision made is enough to allow the surgery to take place. With tissues and structures exposed to the air, the procedure can be performed either with the unaided vision of the surgeon or with the use of loupes or microscopes. Some examples of open surgery used are for herniated disc commonly called a &quot;slipped disc&quot;, and most types of cardiac surgery and neurosurgery.

<doc id="1178068" wikidata="Q3953036" url="?curid=1178068" title="Scratch (2001 film)">
<text>Scratch is a 2001 documentary film, directed and edited by Doug Pray. The film explores the world of the hip-hop DJ from the birth of hip-hop when pioneering DJs began extending breaks on records, to the invention of scratching and beat juggling, to the more recent explosion of turntablism. Throughout the documentary, many artists explain how they were introduced to hip-hop while providing stories of their personal experiences.

== Content ==

=== Elements ===

In the first chapter, Grand Wizard Theodore explains the differences between rap and hip-hop, which are often confused. He explains that graffiti, breakdancing, DJing, MCing, and the way you talk and dress are all elements of hip-hop.

Afrika Bambaataa presents a neighborhood in the Bronx which used to be called &quot;the house of hip-hop&quot; where violence and gangs were common. After a trip to Africa, he created what is known as the Universal Zulu Nation, a group of socially and politically aware rappers, B-boys, graffiti artists and other people involved in hip-hop culture.

The importance of the DJ is shown by how he or she selects and controls the music with respect to the audience&#x27;s needs. The relation and differences between DJs and MCs are explained, going through their roles in the music industry.

Artists such as DJ Jazzy Jay, Grand Mixer DXT, Almighty K.G., Kevie Kev, Dot A Rock, and Steinski explain the beginning of hip-hop and its evolution since the 1970s. Concerts of breakdance and DJ performances are shown such as The Herculords, Electronic Boogaloos, Original Graffiti Rock, &quot;Wild Style&quot; 1982 with Busy Bee &amp; Grand Wizard Theodore and Grand Master Flash.

=== Rockit ===

In the second chapter, Mix Master Mike shares his first experience with scratch through the 1984 Grammy Awards with Herbie Hancock &amp; Grand Mixer DXT. This is the evolution of a new hip-hop transmitted from DJs to DJs.

DJ QBert explains how turntables function, describing each part. He compares it to &quot;talking&quot;. When Mix Master Mike scratched with DJ QBert, they used their scratching to communicate together. They describe it as an art and a form of intelligence. Other artists describe the popularity it had in the 1980s amongst youth at parties and battles. Many of them achieved fame through their talent in battles. Some of them made the existence of the DJ without the MC possible. This chapter features DJ Marz, DJ Eddie Def, DJ Cue, DJ Quest (Bullet Proof Space Travelors), Billy Jam, Dave Paul, DJ Relm, DJ Flare, DJ Shadow, Apollo, and Rob Swift (X-ecutioners).

=== Turntablism ===

This section describes the beginning of turntablism, which involves the manipulation of the turntable. DJ Babu was the first to describe this method using this term. He believes that the turntable can be a musical instrument “as long as you see it as [one].” Babu explains that turntables have notes, measures, different beats, timing, and rhythms. An interview with John Carluccio presents the method used to communicate compositions by transcribing scratching onto paper.

=== Battling ===

Battling became popular as a result of Steve Dee’s attitude that there is always room for improvement. Various DJs are shown commenting about the competitiveness of the industry especially now that there are competitions, such as the Disco Mix Club where DJs have six minutes to showcase their skills and abilities. Each competitor works on their set and practices their routine for months beforehand.

=== DJs with MCs ===

Scratching, like each of these elements, draws from all the others. By definition, scratching does not stand still. As Steve Dee puts it, &quot;Hip-hop is asking you a question, and that question is, what are you going to do?&quot; Discussing the ways that battling shapes his art and profession, Dee confesses, &quot;I&#x27;m competitive. If it&#x27;s drawing a straight line, I wanna draw the straightest line.&quot;

=== Digging ===

This concept of competition does not keep turntablists apart. Rather, they make a point of working together, sharing ideas, encouraging one another, and going on record &quot;digging&quot; jaunts. DJ Shadow leads the camera through a basement so stuffed with records that he can barely walk through, calling it &quot;my little nirvana&quot;. Several scenes show artists playing with one another: Mix Master Mike and DJ Qbert; Shadow and Cut Chemist working with Steinski; and Jurassic 5 with Cut Chemist and DJ Nu-Mark.

=== Making beats ===

The fifth chapter of the film explores the art of producing beats and examines the future of the DJ industry. DJ Premier describes the evolution of beat-making throughout the past 30 years and his life as a record producer. DJ Swamp from The Allies explains some of the beats that he has put together and describes how many artists have begun playing vinyls that are made specifically for turntablist and battle DJs.

Doug Pray then goes to the 2000 NAMM Show in Los Angeles, California. There they conduct a series of interviews that mostly aim at describing the optimistic future of the industry.

The chapter closes by describing the influence that the Invisibl Skratch Piklz has had on the industry.

=== Full circle ===

The final chapter of the film reviews the goals and aspirations of some of the most recognized DJs in the industry and what they hope to achieve via the distribution of their music. DJ QBert explains his understanding of the interconnectedness of the human race and how his “destiny” is to better the lives of others through his music. Grand Mixer DXT describes how good he feels about being the role model of so many DJs. Mix Master Mike states that his goal is to show the world that there’s “something really cool out there, you know, something different.” The film ends with Z-Trip and Cut Chemist performing together side by side on four turntables. This is also known as a 2 x 4 performance.

== Direction ==
Doug Pray didn’t know much about hip-hop DJs before making &quot;Scratch&quot;. He decided to make the movie after meeting Mix Master Mike.

== Production ==
&quot;Scratch&quot; was produced by Brad Blondheim and Ernest Meza, co-produced by Heidi Rataj and executive produced by Allen and Albert Hughes. It was shot in 16mm film by Robert Porter Bennett.

== Awards ==
&quot;Scratch&quot; had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001 and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award by the Independent Feature Project (IFP). In 2002, it was released in theaters nationwide by Palm Pictures, distributed internationally by Intermedia Films. After its release, the film inspired two world tours of top DJs, and a performance movie named &quot;&quot; (also directed by Doug Pray and produced by Brad Blondheim).

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Scratch&quot; was released to near-universal critical praise, with 93% &quot;Fresh&quot; on Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Holden in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, &quot;Watching D.J. Qbert, a leading hip-hop musician from the San Francisco Bay Area, manipulate two turntables with one hand and a sound mixer known as a fader with the other to create a sizzling polyrhythmic landscape of sound effects is not unlike watching the fingers of a great jazz or concert pianist fly across the keyboard.&quot; He also called the film &quot;exhilarating.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Scratch does what a fine documentary does best: It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world, then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively ... [Scratch is] a highly entertaining and encouraging documentary.&quot;

Ain&#x27;t It Cool News listed it as one of the Top 5 Films of the Year and wrote, &quot;Scratch is like having a camera there when Robert Johnson went down to the crossroads. It&#x27;s like having a camera there when BB or Miles played their first show. It&#x27;s a record of living history - a very important history and don&#x27;t let anyone, anyone, tell you otherwise ... Scratch is so strong ... it&#x27;s beautiful and utterly, knowingly true. And that&#x27;s about the most impossible thing to do on-screen ... I can&#x27;t celebrate this film enough.&quot;

<text>.tf is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. Along with .fr, .pm, .re, .wf and .yt it is administered by AFNIC. Before 23 October 2004, Adamsnames, based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom, administered this TLD.

The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are territories either recognised as French or claimed by France but suspended under the Antarctic Treaty System, and the domain name derives from the French, &quot;Terres australes et antarctiques françaises&quot;. Part of the French claim includes a section of the continent of Antarctica, creating an overlap between .tf and the general Antarctica domain .aq.

<text>Southern Westchester refers to the southern portion of Westchester County, New York, a dense inner-ring suburban area north of New York City.

The Westchester County Department of Planning divides the county into North, Central and South geographical sub-regions. Municipalities in Westchester are often referenced in connection to the geographical half of the county they are in; either northern or southern.

==Municipalities==

In New York State, there are three types of political subdivisions (i.e. municipalities) of counties: cities, towns, and villages. While cities are incorporated entities, towns are not. However, areas within a town can incorporate; when this occurs, the said area is called a &quot;village&quot;. Villages have their own additional level of government along with the government of the town the village lies within. Sometimes a town contains a village with the same name; this village usually contains the town&#x27;s center.

Furthermore, certain areas of the incorporated (non-village) part of a town often develop their own identity, based around perhaps a school district or zip code; this unofficial formation is known as a hamlet and may or may not be acknowledged by the United States Census for statistical purposes. No matter how closely its residents may identify with their hamlet, a hamlet is not technically a town and has no political meaning. Rather, it could be described as a &quot;mock village&quot;. A hamlet can incorporate into a village if a charter is drawn up and the state government approves.

The Bronx was part of Westchester County until the late 19th century (the West Bronx being given to New York County in 1874 and East Bronx given to it in 1895); as such, it was considered &quot;Southern Westchester&quot; for much of its history.

<text>Bakka is a tiny village in Aurland Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located on the western shore of the Nærøyfjord, about north of the village of Gudvangen and access to the European route E16 highway. The village is home to the Bakka Church. In 2000, the Bakka Tunnel was constructed on the road from Gudvangen to Bakka to make the journey quicker and safer.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bakka&quot; is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;bakki&quot; which means &quot;(river) bank&quot;. The &quot;-a&quot; ending is the dative case ending used with prepositions to show location: &quot;on the bank&quot;. In the 19th century, it was common to spell the name &quot;Bakke&quot;.

<doc id="1178082" wikidata="Q722527" url="?curid=1178082" title="Sadegh Ghotbzadeh">
<text>Sadegh Ghotbzadeh (, 24 February 1936 – 15 September 1982) was an Iranian politician who served as a close aide of Ayatollah Khomeini during his 1978 exile in France and was foreign minister (30 November 1979 – August 1980) during the Iran hostage crisis following the Iranian Revolution. In 1982, he was executed for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ayatollah Khomeini and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.

==Early life and education==
Ghotbzadeh was born in Isfahan in 1936. He had a sister and a brother. His father was a wealthy lumber merchant.

As a student, he was active in the student branch of the National Front following the toppling of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. He left Iran in 1959 after being detained twice due to his opposition activities to the Shah&#x27;s regime; he lived in Europe, the US and Canada. Ghotbzadeh was a supporter of the National Front of Iran. In addition he was one of the senior members of the Freedom Movement of Iran led by Mehdi Bazargan in the 1960s.

He attended Georgetown University&#x27;s Walsh School of Foreign Service from 1959 to 1963. He contributed to the Freedom Movement from the US. He was part of the more radical wing of the movement together with Ebrahim Yazdi, Mostafa Chamran and Ali Shariati. However, he was dismissed from the school before graduating due to his skipping studies and exams to lead protests against the government of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, including storming a posh party hosted by the then Iranian ambassador to the United States, the son-in-law of the Shah, Ardeshir Zahedi.

Ghotbzadeh left the US when his passport was revoked and moved to Algeria, Egypt, Syria and finally to Iraq, where he met Ayatollah Khomenei in 1963. In December of the same year Ghotbzadeh along with Chamran and Yazdi met the Egyptian authorities to establish an anti-Shah organization in the country, which was later called SAMA, special organization for unity and action. Chamran was chosen as its military head. Ghotbzadeh also developed a close relation with Musa Al Sadr, an Iranian-Lebanese Shia cleric. During his stay in the Middle East, Ghotbzadeh was trained in Lebanon together with Iranian revolutionary militants and Palestinians.

In the late 1960s, Ghotbzadeh went to Canada for higher education and graduated from now defunct Notre Dame University College in Nelson, BC, in 1969. Next he settled in Paris using his Syrian passport which he obtained through the help of Musa Al Sadr. There he worked as a correspondent for the Syrian government daily, &quot;Al Thawra&quot;. The job, in fact, was fake and covered his opposition activity in the city.

==Career and activities==
Ghotbzadeh left the Freedom Movement in 1978. He became a close aide of Ayatollah Khomeini when the latter was in exile in France. Ghotbzadeh along with Mostafa Chamran was part of the faction, called &quot;Syrian mafia&quot;, in the court of Khomeini, and there was a feud between his group and the Libya-friendly group, led by Mohammad Montazeri. Ghotbzadeh was an Amal sympathizer and close to Lebanese Shii cleric Musa Al Sadr. Khomeini appointed him a member of the follow-up mission to search for fate of Al Sadr following the latter&#x27;s disappearance in August 1978.

Ghotbzadeh accompanied Khomeini on his Air France flight back to Iran on 1 February 1979. It was Ghotbzadeh, who translated the Ayatollah&#x27;s infamous response &quot;Hichi (Nothing)&quot; to journalist John Simpson&#x27;s question: &quot;Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?&quot; He was also Khomeini&#x27;s translator in the press conference held in Tehran on 3 February 1979.

Following the Iranian Revolution Ghotbzadeh became a member of the revolutionary council when Bazargan and others left the council to form an interim government. In addition, he served as spokesperson of the Ayatollah. He was also appointed managing director of National Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT) on 11 February 1979. He tried to overhaul it to be in line with Islamic teachings, purging royalists, women, and leftists. This was criticised by a group of Iranian intellectuals and also the interim government. On 13 March, two women, one with a gun and the other with a knife, attacked Ghotbzadeh protesting the fundamentalist policies of the Islamic regime. Nearly 15,000 women also gathered outside the headquarters of the NIRT to protest his Islamist policy.

He was appointed foreign minister in late November 1979 after Abolhassan Banisadr resigned as acting foreign minister amid heated disputes on the fate of the American hostages. In early 1980 Ghotbzadeh was involved in early Iran hostage crisis negotiations in Paris with Carter aide Hamilton Jordan, which led to &quot;a complex multi-stepped plan&quot; which was torpedoed by Khomeini announcing the hostages&#x27; fate would be decided by the new Iranian parliament.

Ghotbzadeh wrote an open letter to the Majlis in August 1980 arguing for the quick release of the hostages, and told Reuters five days later that &quot;United States presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, supported by Kissinger and others, has no intention of solving the problem. They will do everything in their power to block it.&quot; In September and October, he made several other public statements alleging that a deal to delay the release of the hostages may have taken place. The French news agency Agence France Presse quoted him on 6 September as stating the &quot;Reagan camp was trying hard to block a solution of the [hostage] problem before the elections&quot; and that he had &quot;information&quot; to prove it. On 11 September, the open letter was published in an Iranian newspaper with similar charges. A decade later in 1991, Joseph E. Persico of &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded a review of Gary Sick&#x27;s book &quot;October Surprise&quot; stating: &quot;Two friends of Ghotbzadeh who spoke to him frequently during this period said that he insisted repeatedly that the Republicans were in contact with elements in Iran to try to block a hostage release.&quot; The House October Surprise Task Force investigating the October Surprise allegations interviewed close associates of Ghotbzadeh and concluded in 1993 that they &quot;uncovered nothing to corroborate Ghotbzadeh&#x27;s statements&quot;.

After the failure of the rescue attempt decided upon by President Carter, he qualified this decision an &quot;act of war&quot; against Iran. However, Ghotbzadeh was not committed anti-American during his tenure.

In January 1980, Ghotbzadeh ran for the presidency, but lost the election. His tenure as foreign minister ended in August 1980 and he was replaced by Karim Khodapanahi in the post. Following his retirement from politics Ghotbzadeh dealt with his family trade in the importing business and studied Islamic law.

==Arrest and execution==

Ghotbzadeh was first arrested on 7 November 1980 on charges of planning to kill Ayatollah Khomeini and criticising the Islamic Republic Party. He was detained in Evin Prison in Tehran. He was released on 10 November when Ayatollah Khomeini intervened.

On 8 April 1982, he was arrested along with a group of army officers and clerics (including a son-in-law of the religious leader Ayatollah Kazem Shariatmadari), all accused of plotting the assassination of Ayatollah Khomeini and overthrow of the Islamic Republic.

Hujjat al-Islam Mohammad Reyshahri, the chief judge of the newly created Military Revolutionary Tribunal, explained what the plot was about. He used &quot;an elaborate chart full of boxes and arrows linking Ghotbzadeh and the royalist officers, on one side, to &#x27;the feudalists, the leftist mini-groups, and the phony clerics&#x27; and on the other side, to the &#x27;National Front, Israel, the Pahlavis and the Socialist International.&#x27; The last four were linked to the CIA.&quot;

The twenty-six day trial of Ghotbzadeh began in August 1982. In court he denied the accusations but confirmed the existence of a plot to topple the Islamic government and form a &quot;real republic&quot;. His forced confessions, which were aired, are said to have come only after severe torture on the part of the police. Late on 15 September 1982, Ghotbzadeh was shot by a firing squad in Evin Prison. The Military Revolutionary Tribunal had sentenced him to death. He was 46.

===Reactions===
Abolhassan Banisadr, who had been in exile in Paris, stated that Ghotbzadeh&#x27;s execution was &quot;settling of accounts&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ghotbzadeh never married. In 1987, Canadian journalist Carole Jerome published a book, &quot;The man in the mirror: A story of love, revolution and treachery in Iran&quot;, detailing both her romantic relationship with Ghotbzadeh and her journalistic account of the revolution.

He was fluent in French and English.

==Legacy==
In his 1991 book, &quot;Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality&quot;, Vladimir Kuzichkin claimed that Ghotbzadeh had been an agent of the Soviet military intelligence service during his studies in the United States before later detaching himself from it. The book also alleged that the KGB had fabricated and placed a false CIA cable to an unnamed American agent in Iran in his residence, which was used as evidence to arrest and try him.

Ben Affleck&#x27;s 2012 movie, &quot;Argo&quot;, used a real clip of Ghotbzadeh, showing him accusing Canada of &quot;flagrantly violating international law.&quot; Ghotbzadeh&#x27;s great-niece, Sanaz Ghajarrahimi, wrote and directed a play, named &quot;Red Wednesday&quot;, which was presented at the New Ohio Theatre in New York from 26 July to 3 August 2013. It was inspired by Ghotbzadeh&#x27;s controversial life.

In 2017 Ali Sajjadi, a Persian journalist, based in Washington DC, published a collection of Sadegh Ghotbzadeh manuscripts. Sajjadi also interviewed many friends and colleagues of Ghotbzadeh for the book.

The BBC Persian documentary series, &quot;Son of the Revolution&quot;, premiered in February 2020. The series follows Ghotbzadeh&#x27;s fascinating journey from a revolutionary in exile, to government minister and finally traitor in the eyes of the Islamic Republic. It was directed and produced by Farshad Bayan working with producer and researcher Mahmoud Azimaee. The project took over five years to complete. The three-part mini series uses archive footage and features many people who knew Ghotbzadeh or had interesting encounters with him to shed light on his character and relate stories about his activities both before and after the Iranian Revolution. The documentary was published on YouTube in Persian and with English subtitles.

<doc id="1178087" wikidata="Q2869299" url="?curid=1178087" title="Jewish atheism">
<text>Jewish atheism is the atheism of people who are ethnically and (at least to some extent) culturally Jewish. 

&quot;Jewish atheism&quot; is not a contradiction because Jewish identity encompasses not only religious components but also ethnic and cultural ones. Jewish law&#x27;s emphasis on descent through the mother means that even religiously conservative Orthodox Jewish authorities would accept an atheist born to a Jewish mother as fully Jewish.

Jewish secularism, which describes Jews who do not explicitly reject God&#x27;s existence but also do not believe it is an important part of their Jewishness, has a long tradition in the United States. A 2013 study by the Pew Research Center found that 62% of self-described American Jews say being Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while just 15% say it is mainly a matter of religion. Even among Jews by religion, 55% say being Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while 66% say it is not necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.

==Organized Jewish life==
Atheist and secular Jewish organizations mostly date to the 20th century, from the Jewish socialist Bund in early-20th-century Poland to the modern Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and the Society for Humanistic Judaism in the United States. 

Many Jewish atheists feel comfortable within any of the three major non-Orthodox Jewish denominations (Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist). This is less of a contradiction than it might first seem, given Judaism&#x27;s emphasis on practice over belief, with even mainstream guides to Judaism suggesting that belief in God is not necessary for Jewish observance. But Orthodox Judaism regards the acceptance of the &quot;Yoke of Heaven&quot; (the sovereignty of the God of Israel in the world and the divine origin of the Torah) as a fundamental obligation for Jews, and the Reform movement has rejected atheistic temples&#x27; efforts at affiliation even though many Reform Jews are atheist or agnostic. Nevertheless, there are many atheists in many denominations of modern Judaism, from Humanistic Judaism to Conservative Judaism.

== Jewish theology ==
19th-century and early-20th-century Reform Judaism in the U.S., which became the dominant form of Judaism there by the 1880s, was profoundly shaped by its engagement with high-profile skeptics and atheists such as Robert Ingersoll and Felix Adler. These included the writings of rabbis such as Isaac Mayer Wise, Kaufmann Kohler, Emil G. Hirsch, Joseph Krauskopf, Aaron Hahn, and J. Leonard Levy, resulting in a distinctly panentheistic U.S. Reform Jewish theology, which many would have viewed as atheistic or having atheistic tendencies.

Liberal Jewish theology makes few metaphysical claims and is thus compatible with atheism on an ontological level. The founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, Mordecai Kaplan, espoused a naturalistic definition of God, and some post-Holocaust theology has also eschewed a personal god. The Jewish philosopher Howard Wettstein has advanced a non-metaphysical approach to religious commitment, according to which metaphysical theism-atheism is not the issue. Harold Schulweis, a Conservative rabbi trained in the Reconstructionist tradition, has argued that Jewish theology should move from a focus on God to an emphasis on &quot;godliness&quot;. This &quot;predicate theology&quot;, while continuing to use theistic language, makes few metaphysical claims that non-believers would find objectionable.

==Secular Jewish culture==

Many Jewish atheists reject even this level of ritualized and symbolic identification, instead embracing a thoroughgoing secularism and basing their Jewishness entirely in ethnicity and secular Jewish culture. Possibilities for secular Jewishness include identification with Jewish history and peoplehood, immersion in Jewish literature (including such non-religious Jewish authors as Philip Roth and Amos Oz), consumption of Jewish food, use of Jewish humor, and attachment to Jewish languages such as Yiddish, Hebrew, and Ladino. A high proportion of Israeli Jews consider themselves secular, rejecting some religious practices (see Religion in Israel). While some non-believers of Jewish ancestry do not consider themselves Jews, preferring to define themselves solely as atheists, others believe Judaism is a culture and tradition that can be embraced without religious faith.

Many Jewish atheists continue to observe Jewish traditions, holidays, and customs, but view them more as cultural heritage than religious obligations. For example, celebrating Hanukkah or Passover can be seen as an important family and cultural ritual rather than a religious act. In the documentary series &quot;Еврейское счастье&quot; (&quot;Jewish Happiness&quot;), alongside exploring other aspects, the question &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; is extensively discussed. In one episode, a family of atheists deeply engages in certain Jewish religious traditions, such as Shabbat, which, one of the documentary&#x27;s characters asserts, has come to us as a tradition from ancient times but fits very well into contemporary reality. Specifically, it provides the opportunity to spend a whole day communicating with one&#x27;s children, free from pervasive modern issues like phubbing and FOMO.

Some Jewish atheists are active in secular and humanist movements that advocate separation of church and state, human rights, and a scientific worldview.

==Notable people==

Famous atheist or agnostic Jews include Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud. Their views on religion influenced their work and philosophical positions as well as subsequent scientists and philosophers. Many well-known Jews have rejected a belief in deities. Some have denied the existence of a traditional deity while continuing to use religious language. Marx was born into an ethnically Jewish family but raised as a Lutheran, and is among the most notable and influential atheist thinkers of modern history; he developed dialectical and historical materialism, which became the basis for his critique of capitalism and theories of scientific socialism. He was a major influence on other prominent Jewish intellectuals, including Moses Hess. One of Marx&#x27;s most cited comments on religion is &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&quot;

The contradictory symbiosis between religiosity and atheism among atheists in the Jewish context has ambivalent qualities and is discussed extensively in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Atheism&quot;, as is how Jewish thinkers deal with these dynamics. This nuanced connection is also evident in other prominent Jewish atheists who maintained their cultural identity. The text discusses how the concept of religion developed in a Judeo-Christian context can be incorrect when applied outside that context. But careful application of these concepts can shed light on the unique perspectives of Jewish atheists who still value their cultural heritage. In Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot;, he eschews religious belief and outlines its origins and prospects. But Freud also urged a Jewish colleague to raise his son in the Jewish religion, saying, &quot;If you do not let your son grow up as a Jew, you will deprive him of those sources of energy which cannot be replaced by anything else.&quot; Other researchers have written about Freud&#x27;s views on religion and Jewish identity.
Other famous Jews have wholeheartedly embraced atheism, rejecting religiosity altogether. The anarchist Emma Goldman was born to an Orthodox Jewish family and rejected belief in God, while the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, when asked if she believed in God, answered: &quot;I believe in the Jewish people, and the Jewish people believe in God.&quot; Of David Ben-Gurion, the founder of Israel known for his atheism, it was often said: &quot;Although he didn&#x27;t believe in God, it seems God believed in him.&quot; Woody Allen&#x27;s work often explores the tension between his Jewishness and religious doubt (&quot;Not only is there no God, but try getting a plumber on weekends&quot;). David Silverman, president of the American Atheists from 2010 to 2018, swore after his bar mitzvah that he would never again lie about his atheism. American Jewish author Philip Roth was an outspoken atheist and called himself anti-religious. Ayn Rand, a Russia-born American philosopher of Jewish descent, was a staunch atheist and considered atheism an integral part of her philosophy of objectivism. Her atheistic ideas significantly influenced libertarianism and individualism.

== Research studies ==
Jewish atheism has a long history, with recorded sources dating to the 17th century. Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza is considered the Jewish herald of the secular age. In his &quot;Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot;, Pierre Bayle called Spinoza &quot;the greatest atheist&quot;. Jewish thinkers of the 19th century were especially zealous in accusing Spinoza of atheism (criticizing his work &quot;Ethics&quot;), especially in terms of his denial of &quot;revelation&quot;, but this was not atheism in the modern sense.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, many Jews embraced secular and socialist ideals. Particularly in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, many Jews became atheists under the influence of communist ideology.

Confirming the diverse history of Jewish atheism, reflecting a wide range of views and approaches to faith and identity, a blog entry by Vladimir Minkov on the &quot;Times of Israel&quot; portal notes that a significant portion of modern U.S. Jews identify themselves as atheists or agnostics. Minkov argues that this is due to various factors, including lack of deep understanding of Jewish religious teachings and desire to find a Jewish identity outside traditional religious frameworks. Some interviews with Jewish atheists show that many of them continue to observe Jewish traditions and participate in cultural activities despite renouncing their religious beliefs. This demonstrates ambivalence when cultural-ethnic identity and a certain religiosity are preserved even in the absence of faith in God. Thus atheism among Jews is not only widespread but multifaceted, providing rich material for research and discussion on the topic of faith and identity in the Jewish context and making atheism among Jews an interesting subject for interdisciplinary research.

<text>Rapetosaurus ( ) is a genus of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur that lived in Madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Only one species, Rapetosaurus krausei, has been identified.

Like other sauropods, &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was a quadrupedal herbivore; it is calculated to have reached lengths of 15 metres (49 ft).

==Description==
&quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was a fairly typical sauropod, with a short and slender tail, a very long neck and a huge, elephant-like body. Its head resembles the head of a diplodocid, with a long, narrow snout and nostrils on the top of its skull. It was a herbivore and its small, pencil-like teeth were good for ripping the leaves off trees but not for chewing.
It was fairly modest in size, for a titanosaur. The juvenile specimen measured from head to tail, and &quot;probably weighed about as much as an elephant&quot;. An adult would have been about twice as long ( in length) which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin, like &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Paralititan&quot;. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated the size of the probable adult specimen (MAD 93-18), which is known from a femur, at 16.5 meters (54 ft) and 10.3 tonnes (11.35 short tons).

==Discovery and naming==
The discovery of &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;, known by the single species &quot;Rapetosaurus krausei&quot; marked the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton, complete with skull. It has helped to clarify some difficult, century-old classification issues, among this large group of sauropod dinosaurs and provides a good baseline for the reconstruction of other titanosaurs that are known only from partial fossilized remains.

The discovery was published in 2001 by Kristina Curry Rogers and Catherine A. Forster in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;. The nearly-complete skeleton is that of a juvenile and partial remains from three other individuals were also recovered.

The dig uncovered a partial skull (UA 8698, the holotype specimen), another partial skull, a juvenile skeleton missing only a few tail vertebrae, and an unrelated vertebra. The juvenile skeleton, in particular, is the most complete titanosaur skeleton ever recovered and the only one with a head still attached to the body.

The fossilized remains were found in the Mahajanga basin in northwest Madagascar, not far from the port city of Mahajanga. They were recovered from a layer of sandstone known as the Anembalemba Member, which is part of the Maevarano Formation. The rock formation has been dated to the Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous, which means the fossilized bones are about 70 million years old. They were found by a field team from Stony Brook University with the assistance of the local Universite d&#x27;Antananarivo. The team leader, David Krause, had been excavating fossils from the site since 1993.

The generic name &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; is derived from Rapeto (a giant deity in Malagasy folklore credited for the geographical features of the land) and &quot;sauros&quot;, which is Greek for lizard. The species epithet, &quot;krausei&quot;, is named after the team leader of the expedition, David W. Krause.

==Paleobiology==
===Growth===
A rare specimen of a juvenile &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was uncovered in a museum collection by Kristina Curry Rogers and colleagues. The specimen was estimated to weigh about 40 kilograms (88 pounds) and was likely between 39 and 77 days old by the time of its death. At the time of its hatching, the juvenile &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was estimated to be 3.4 kilograms (7.8 pounds) in weight. Based on bone remodeling, the juvenile sauropod was also believed to have been capable of surviving with little to no parental care. Analysis of the bones further revealed the young &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; likely starved to death due to Cretaceous Madagascar&#x27;s harsh droughts.

==Paleoecology==
During the Maastrichtian, like it is now, Madagascar was an island, having separated from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Many prehistoric animals inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels at the beginning of the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do so into the Paleocene Epoch, so &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.

Besides &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;, fossil taxa recovered from the Maevarano include fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, seven distinct species of crocodylomorphs, five or six species of mammals, &quot;Vorona&quot; and several other birds, the possibly flighted dromaeosaurid &quot;Rahonavis&quot;, the noasaurid &quot;Masiakasaurus&quot;, and the abelisaurid &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;. A variety of extinct mammals have also been discovered, such as gondwanatheres and non-placental eutherians, the former reaching large sizes such as &quot;Vintana&quot;.
The skull of &quot;Majungasaurus&quot;, a large abelisaurid theropod, was discovered in 1996. It is similar to species found in India and Argentina, indicating that land bridges between the fragments of the former supercontinent of Gondwana still existed in the late Cretaceous, far later than was previously believed. The most likely occurrence was a land bridge allowing animals to cross from South America to Antarctica, and then up to India and Madagascar. &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; was the largest predator in its environment, while the only known contemporaneous large herbivores were sauropods like &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;. Scientists have suggested that &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; specialized in hunting sauropods. &quot;Majungasaurus&quot; tooth marks on &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; bones indicate that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.

Typically, titanosaurs were unusual among sauropods in that they coexisted with large ornithischian dinosaurs such as ceratopsids, hadrosaurs, and ankylosaurs. However, &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was atypical among titanosaurs in that it shared the Mahajanga basin with only one other large herbivore, another titanosaur. Smaller herbivores were rare, with only one, &quot;Simosuchus&quot;, being discovered during over 100 years of collection in that area. Due to the absence of ornithischian dinosaurs, it is suggested that prehistoric Madagascar saw a different herbivore community dynamic than was seen elsewhere in the Cretaceous.

<text>This Ain&#x27;t the Rosedale Library was an independent bookstore located in Toronto, Ontario. Located near Bond and Queen, and later in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the store moved to Kensington Market in May 2008, but closed in June 2010. Its name referred to Rosedale, an affluent neighbourhood of the city.

It was a general interest bookstore promoting small press publications, nontraditional and experimental fiction, LGBT literature, graphic novels, countercultural nonfiction and one of the largest selections of contemporary poetry in Canada. Because both owners were passionate about baseball, the store also had a reputation for its especially deep selection of baseball-related books; as well, the store was known for offering Toronto&#x27;s largest selection of underground zines. The store had a longstanding policy of only carrying books that at least one of the owners or employees had personally read, in order to ensure that the store&#x27;s values were reflected in its selection of titles.

The store was opened in 1979 by Charles Huisken, and Daniel Bazuin became co-owner in 1981. Originally located on Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis, it moved to its more familiar location near Church and Wellesley by the mid-1980s. 

The bookstore had a rich history of author visits and readings, ranging from William S. Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson to Alison Bechdel and Sarah Waters. Local scene members such as Stuart Ross, Joey Comeau, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha and Marnie Woodrow made regular appearances to read and teach. The bookstore was also part of the &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s 100&quot;, the small selection of independent bookstores that were approved to sell Dave Eggers&#x27; literary magazine &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot; and his early novels.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Mercer named it Canada&#x27;s best independent bookstore and the eighth best in the world, calling it a &quot;model&quot; for how an independent bookstore could survive in the changing retail climate. By this time, Bazuin and Huisken were sending signals that they were open to selling the store to a new buyer, although none materialized. At the time of their move to Kensington Market in 2008, Bazuin sold his share of the store to Huisken&#x27;s son Jesse. Prior to the move, the store had considered opening the Kensington Market store as a second location while keeping the Church Street location open, but rejected the idea as financially unfeasible. Glad Day Bookshop then considered taking over the former This Ain&#x27;t location on Church Street, although due to the high rent it did not do so.

By 2010, however, the store was having difficulty paying its monthly rent at the new location, and it closed permanently in June of that year.

<doc id="1178093" wikidata="Q1407659" url="?curid=1178093" title="Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS">
<text>The Ferrari 308 GTB berlinetta and targa-topped 308 GTS are V8 mid-engined, two-seater sports cars manufactured by the Italian company Ferrari from 1975 until 1985. The 308 replaced the Dino 246 GT and GTS in 1975 and was updated as the 328 GTB/GTS in 1985. The similar 208 GTB and GTS were equipped with a smaller, initially naturally aspirated and later turbocharged, two-litre engine, and were sold mainly in Italy.

==Construction==
The 308 had a tube frame with separate body. The 308 GTB/GTS and GT4 were mechanically similar, and also shared much with the original Dino. Both 308s sit on the same tube platform, however the GT4—being a 2+2—has a longer wheelbase.
The engine was a V8 of a 90 degree configuration, with two belt-driven overhead camshafts per cylinder bank. It was transversely mounted in unit with the transaxle transmission assembly, which was below and to the rear of the engine&#x27;s sump. All models used a fully synchromesh 5-speed &quot;dog-leg&quot; manual gearbox and a clutch-type limited-slip differential.
Suspension was all-independent, comprising double wishbones, coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers, and anti-roll bars on both axles; four wheel vented disc brakes were also fitted. Steering was unassisted rack and pinion.

The 308&#x27;s body was designed by Pininfarina&#x27;s Leonardo Fioravanti, who had been responsible for some of Ferrari&#x27;s most celebrated shapes to date such as the Daytona, the Dino and the Berlinetta Boxer. The 308 used elements of these shapes to create something very much in contrast with the angular Bertone-designed GT4.
GTS models featured a removable roof panel with grained satin black finish, which could be stowed in a vinyl cover behind the seats when not in use.
==Model history==

===308 GTB/GTS===
The Pininfarina-styled Ferrari 308 GTB was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1975 as a supplement to the Bertone-shaped 2+2 &quot;Dino&quot; 308 GT4 and a direct replacement for the two-seater Dino 246.

Its &quot;F106 AB&quot; V8 engine was equipped with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburettors and single coil ignition. European versions produced at 6600 rpm (7700 rpm redline), but American versions were down to at 6,600 rpm due to emissions control devices. European specification cars used dry sump lubrication. Cars destined to the Australian, Japanese and US market were fitted with a conventional wet sump engine from the GT4.

A notable aspect of the early 308 GTB was that, although still built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, its bodywork was originally entirely made of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), allowing a very light weight of . This lasted until June 1977, when the 308 was switched to steel bodies, resulting in an overall weight increase of approximately .

Five-spoke 14-inch alloy wheels were standard, while 16-inch wheels were made available later as an option together with sports exhaust system, high compression Borgo pistons, a high lift camshaft P6 and a deeper front spoiler, this option was called &quot;Sprintpack&quot;.

At the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show, the targa topped 308 GTS was introduced. All GTS&#x27; received a wet-sump engine and were steel-bodied. European GTB models retained the dry sump lubrication until 1981.

There were 3,219 GTS&#x27; and 2,897 GTBs made from 1975 to 1980. Only 808 of the fibreglass (&quot;vetroresina&quot; in Italian) version were made, all with the Berlinetta bodywork.

===308 GTBi/GTSi===
In 1980 Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection was offered, leading to the 308 GTBi and GTSi; emissions decreased, at the price of a power drop to on European models and on federalized models. The fuel injection was coupled to a Marelli MED 803A Digiplex electronic ignition, incorporating a coil, distributor, and ignition module for each bank of cylinders.

Outside, the car was identical to the 308 GTB/GTS, save for metric sized wheels of a slightly different design, fitted with Michelin TRX radial tyres—Michelin XWX on 16-inch wheels were optional. Inside, the clock and oil temperature gauge were moved to the centre console; there were also a new black steering wheel with three perforated spokes, and seats of a different pattern.

494 GTBis and 1743 GTSis were produced before the model was succeeded by the 308 &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot; in 1982.
===308 GTB/GTS Quattrovalvole===
Two years later, at the 1982 Paris Motor Show, Ferrari launched the 308 quattrovalvole, in GTB and GTS form. The main change from the 308 GTBi/GTSi it succeeded were the four valves per cylinder—hence its name, &quot;quattrovalvole&quot;, literally &quot;four valves&quot; in Italian—which pushed output back up to restoring some of the performance lost to the emission control equipment.

The new model could be recognized by the addition of a slim louvred panel in the front lid to aid radiator exhaust air exit, power operated mirrors carrying a small enamel Ferrari badge, a redesigned radiator grille with rectangular driving lights on each side, and rectangular (in place of round) side repeaters. The interior also received some minor updates, such as a satin black three spoke steering wheel with triangular centre; cloth seat centres became available as an option to the standard full leather. Available options included metallic paint, a deep front spoiler, air conditioning, wider, 16-inch Speedline wheels with Pirelli P7 tyres, and a satin black roof aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).

Apart from the DOHC 32-valve cylinder heads, the V8 engine was essentially of the same design as that used in the 308 GTSi model. Total displacement was , with a bore x stroke of . Output on European specification cars was at 7000 rpm and at 5000 rpm of torque, while for US specification variants were SAE net at 6800 rpm and at 5500 rpm of torque. The gear and final drive ratios were altered to suit the revised characteristics of the four valves per cylinder engine. One other significant benefit of the QV&#x27;s four valve heads was the replacement of the non-QV models sodium valves which have been known to fail at the joint between the head and the stem. Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and Magneti Marelli Digiplex electronic ignition were carried over from the GTBi/GTSi. All US market examples were fitted with catalytic converters.

The 288 GTO introduced in 1984 is considered as the first Ferrari supercar. The 288 borrowed much of the styling from the European 308 GTB QV of the previous year, 1983: it is also powered by a similar 2.8-litre V8 with a smaller bore and twin turbochargers, it retained the general bodywork lines with extended wheelarches, different side air vents, and bigger rear spoiler, longer () wheelbase, and the central tubular space frame chassis.

In 1985 Ferrari launched the 328, which replaced the Quattrovalvole. Between 1982 and 1985 the quattrovalvole was produced in a total of 3042 GTS and only 748 GTB examples.
===208 GTB/GTS===
In 1980 Ferrari introduced a two-litre version of the 308, 208 GTB and 208 GTS. They were mainly for the domestic Italian market, where new cars with engines above 2 litres were subjected to a much higher value added tax, 38% instead of the standard 18%. The 208 was also listed in Portugal and New Zealand. The 208 GTB/GTS replaced the 208 GT4 2+2. It is often regarded as the slowest Ferrari ever made but proved faster than the 208 GT4 Bertone in a 1980 test by American magazine &quot;Motor Trend&quot;.

The engine was de-bored to 66.8 mm (giving it an undersquare design) for a total displacement of , resulting in one of the smallest V8 engines ever produced. Fed through four Weber 34 DCNF carburetors, the V8 produced at 6800 rpm. 160 208 GTS and 140 208 GTB cars were produced in 1980 and 1981.

===208 GTB/GTS Turbo===
In 1982 the two-litre 208 was succeeded by a turbocharged and fuel injected version, the 208 GTB Turbo unveiled at the Turin Motor Show. It was the first ever turbocharged road-going Ferrari. A GTS version was introduced a year later, in 1983. Like the original 208, this model was intended for the Italian domestic market.

The 208&#x27;s engine was given a single KKK K26 turbocharger with wastegate valve, Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and Marelli electronic ignition. The turbocharging system&#x27;s design was heavily influenced by the contemporary Ferrari 126C2 Formula One car. Forced induction increased power to at 7000 rpm, while torque output increased by 18 percent. The 208 Turbo was claimed to accelerate from 0- in 6.6 seconds, with a top speed of 150 mph.

Both outside and inside the 208 Turbo was almost identical to the contemporary 308 Quattrovalvole. It could be recognized by NACA ducts in front of the rear wheel well openings and &quot;turbo&quot; badging on the tail and shrouded exhaust pipes. Extra cooling slots were also added to the lower front spoiler, below the radiator grille. In the rear of the car, additional louvers were added to the engine cover and a cooling vent was placed in the center of the rear bumper, splitting it in two. The deep front spoiler and black roof aileron, optional on the 308, were standard equipment on the 208 Turbo.

Production ended in 1985 after 437 GTB Turbo and 250 GTS Turbo cars were produced. In 1986 they were replaced by the 328-based, intercooled GTB/GTS Turbo.

== In popular culture ==

The 308 was made famous by the television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; in which the series&#x27; lead, Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck) drove the car around Oahu for eight seasons while on his investigations, from 1980 to 1988. Several 308 GTS cars were used, a new one for each season, most being auctioned off after filming and all with the license plate &quot;ROBIN 1&quot;.

* Season 1 – 1979 308GTS 
* Seasons 2–6 – 1981 308GTSi
* Seasons 7–8 – 1984 308GTSi quattrovalvole

== Awards ==
In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named this car number five on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s.

==Regional differences==
Among the typically yearly updates to the performance and style of the 308 throughout its run, cars from the same series would have a number of differences between them depending on their intended export market (which is usual for European cars). For example, a 308 destined for the American market would sport much larger heavier bumpers and a slightly sturdier frame (and many other smaller details) in order to meet more stringent US road safety standards. American market cars also suffered a performance hit due to a compression ratio of 8.6:1 vs 9.2:1 for most of the rest of the world state emissions legislation which reduced horsepower. As a result of these differences there is often a premium paid for the &quot;purer&quot; European spec car over the federalized car.

Some differences between the Euro-spec and US-spec cars are shown below:
* 240 hp vs. 233 hp (for QV model)
* Different gear ratios
* Lighter, small front bumper that follows the hood line vs. 2.5 mph impact bumper that is extended and has extra &quot;fangs&quot;
* Lighter, small rear bumper vs. impact bumper with spacer
* Exposed dual-tip muffler vs. black muffler cover with catalytic converter
* Vitaloni style outside mirrors vs. larger flag mirrors that provide a better view for safety
* Small circular amber Italian-spec front turn signal repeaters with no side lights vs. large rectangular amber front and red rear US-spec side marker light/reflector units (many euro cars now in the USA had the euro lights converted to USA spec and added the red rear lights)
* No &quot;fasten seat belt&quot; warning light in Euro spec
* Flash to pass driving lights in front grill in Euro spec
* Space saver spare tyre vs. full size spare
* Rear engine cover top has only a left and right grill vs. U-shaped grill that provides a larger cooling area necessary for the added catalytic converter just behind the muffler.
* Overall weight of Euro spec lower because of door beams and bumpers.

== 308 GTB Millechiodi ==
The 308 GTB Millechiodi was an aerodynamic study based on the 308 GTB and designed by Pininfarina. It was first shown at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show. Differences from the standard 308 GTB include a custom, unpainted aerodynamic body kit and the instrument panel from the Berlinetta Boxer. Some of its styling elements would later show up in the Ferrari 288 GTO.

== Rally versions ==
From 1978 through 1986, rally racing versions of the Ferrari 308 GTB were developed and produced in small numbers by Michelotto, a Padua-based Ferrari dealer and race-preparation workshop. Michelotto was owned and operated by Giuliano Michelotto, not to be confused with Italian automotive designer Giovanni Michelotti. Although Michelotto was organizationally independent from Ferrari, the cars were developed in close collaboration with Ferrari factory engineers. The Michelotto workshop built rally versions of the 308 GTB to compete in Group 4 and Group B classes of the World Rally Championship. This production included cars based on modified production chassis and engines as well as the more radical, purpose-built 308 GT/M. These cars were raced with some success from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, but development and officially sanctioned competition use of the type ceased in 1986 with the cancellation of the Group B class.

=== Group 4 ===

Michelotto began constructing Group 4-specification 308 GTB rally cars in 1978. In 1980, Michelotto provided a Gr.4 308 to Padova-based rally driver &quot;Nico&quot; Grosoli. Grosoli provided funding for Michelotto&#x27;s efforts and was able to bring in more assistance from the Ferrari factory. At the time, Lancia was the Fiat Group&#x27;s official entrant into the World Rally Championship. Although Ferrari was also a member of the Fiat Group, which ostensibly co-ordinated competition activities between member brands, Michelotto (with Grosoli&#x27;s assistance) was able to obtain official support from the Ferrari factory.

Ferrari supplied bare 308 GTB chassis and engines which Michelotto built into complete rally racing cars. Michelotto installed lightweight tubular framed chassis sections made of steel and titanium, including a roll cage and a modified engine bay designed to allow easier maintenance access. They were equipped with 2-valve-per-cylinder (i.e. early type non-Quattrovalvole) engines using high-compression pistons, revised valves, cams, bearings, and spark plugs. Bosch Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection was used instead of the Weber carburetors or Bosch K-Jetronic injection systems seen on roadgoing 308 models. Two additional oil coolers were added at the front of the car. After modifications by Michelotto, this engine produced approximately 288-330 bhp. A close-ratio transmission with no synchromesh was fitted to improve acceleration. The suspension used standard 308 components with adjustable Koni shock absorbers. The suspension was tuned for the varied surfaces found in rally stages and had a visibly higher ride height than 308 road cars. Brakes were standard 308 equipment with an added brake balance controller. Wider wheels by Campagnolo or Ruote Neri were fitted. The bodywork was constructed from fiberglass and Kevlar and was equipped with larger fender flares and optional lights for night stages. In order to save weight, the interior was stripped, Sparco fiberglass racing seats installed and the motorized hidden headlight mechanisms were replaced with manually operated mechanisms. Michelotto built a total of 11 Gr.4-specification 308 rally cars.

Group 4 308s competed in rallies from 1978 through at least 1983. During 1978–79, a Michelotto-prepared Gr.4 308 was campaigned in several rallies by Roberto Liviero and Rafaele &quot;Lele&quot; Pinto, winning the 1979 Rally di Monza. Later in 1980, one of the Gr.4 cars was driven by &quot;Nico&quot; Grosoli in multiple rallies, including the Costa Smeralda Rally, Rally il Ciocco, Rally di Piancavallo and the Targa Florio Rally. French driver Jean-Claude Andruet witnessed the 308 competing at the Targa Florio and convinced Charles Pozzi&#x27;s team to run a team of Gr.4 308s during 1981. Four Gr.4 308s were built by Michelotto for Pozzi. While the Pozzi team did not attempt to compete in all the World Rally Championship races, they were successful in the limited number of tarmac and light gravel rallies they entered. The Pozzi team declined to enter those events that involved forest roads and/or snow, as they did not feel the 308 would be competitive on such terrain. In 1981, Andruet and co-drivers Chantal Bouchetal and Michele &quot;Biche&quot; Petit won the Targa Florio Rally, the Rally 4 Regioni, the 24 Ore de Ypres, and the Tour de France Automobile. They temporarily held the lead in but did not win the Tour de Corse, the Rally Costa Brava, Hunsrück Rallye and the Rali Vinho da Madeira. A second Pozzi Gr.4 308 was driven by Guy Chasseuil with co-driver Bernadette Chasseuil, who did not score any wins but placed second several times. The Pozzi team continued to run the 308s in 1982, including a second-place overall finish for Andruet/Petit in the Tour de Corse, the best ever result for the 308 in an official calendar WRC event. Also in 1982, an independent team consisting of Italians Tonino Tognana and Massimo de Antoni driving a Gr.4 308 won the Rally il Ciocco and the Rally di Piancavallo and placed second at the Colline di Romagna. In 1983, an independent driver competing under the pseudonym &quot;Panic&quot; raced an ex-Pozzi Gr.4 308 in the Tour de France and Tour de Corse, finishing both among the top ranked non-works entries.

=== Group B ===

Following the introduction of Group B rules in 1982, Michelotto began building 308 GTB rally cars to compete in that class. The first Gr.B 308 was built at the request of Spanish rally driver Antonio Zanini. Four Gr.B specification cars were built, with certain engine and bodywork details differing from the earlier Gr.4 cars. The first Gr.B 308, chassis 18869, was constructed with a 2-valve engine like the Gr.4 cars, while the 3 later cars used a 4-valve-per-cylinder engine and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection from the 308 Quattrovalvole. The QV motor produced 310 hp at 8,000 rpm after tuning by Michelotto. The Gr.B cars were also equipped with a &quot;quick-change&quot; gearbox that allowed the final drive ratio to be replaced quickly and easily during racing or testing. Additional modifications included upgraded Brembo brakes, Fondmetal Canonica wheels, stronger anti-roll bars, rose-joint suspension links, lighter suspension wishbones and a quicker-ratio steering rack.

As initial homologation rules required that Gr.B cars use the same body panels as their roadgoing counterparts, the Gr.B 308s were equipped with steel and fiberglass panels. This increased total weight by over the earlier Gr.4 cars. The 308 was homologated under Group B rules three separate times in October 1982, January 1983 and April 1983. This allowed Michelotto to incorporate additional Ferrari-made performance parts into their Gr.B cars, including engine parts, lightweight windows and body panels.

In 1983, chassis 18869 was driven to first-place finishes at several rallies, including the Imperia Rally and the Sicilian Rally Championship. In 1985, Antonio Zanini drove this car to a third-place finish at the Targa Florio, followed by several other wins which led to his victory in the Spanish Rally Championship. At the 1984 Rally Della Lana, Luigi &quot;Lucky&quot; Battistolli and Claudio Berro drove chassis 18847 to a second-place finish. Also in 1984, the same car was driven to a third-place finish at the Rally di Monza by Björn Waldegård and co-driver Claes Billstam.

=== 308 GT/M ===

The Ferrari 308 GT/M was developed by Ferrari and Michelotto to compete under the Group B &quot;Evolution/Termination&quot; rules. Development began in November 1982 as the successes of the Gr.4 308 convinced Ferrari and Michelotto that a purpose-built Ferrari rally car could be competitive under Group B rules. The model was cancelled with the banning of Group B cars for the 1987 season.

The 308 GT/M was built on a newly designed tubular frame steel chassis and a 3.0 liter 308 Quattrovalvole engine. This engine was mounted longitudinally in a rear-mid-engine position, in contrast to the transverse mounting of the 308 road cars and the earlier Gr.4 rally cars. The engine was upgraded internally and used an equal-length exhaust system and modified Bosch Kugelfischer fuel injection. This engine produced approx 363-370 bhp at 8900 rpm. Upgraded pistons, valves and camshafts were used and both the camshaft and belt covers were cast in lightweight magnesium alloy. A Hewland 5-speed manual transaxle was mounted at the rear and supplied power to the rear wheels only. The car was also fitted with a dual-plate, Formula-One type Borg &amp; Beck clutch. Double wishbone suspension and coil springs were used at all four wheels, with suspension geometry based on the Ferrari Mondial. Some standard 308 and Mondial components were incorporated, although many were modified. The suspension arms and steering rack both had two alternative mounting positions to allow ride height adjustments. Brembo brakes were fitted, including a hydraulically operated handbrake. The Kevlar and carbon fiber body of the car was designed by Francesco Boniolo. It resembled the earlier Ferrari 512 BB/LM and was influenced by wind tunnel testing of that model. It incorporated large, fixed headlights and a prominent rear spoiler. The body was constructed by Carrozzeria Auto Sport near Modena. Total weight of the car was , 120 kg less than the minimum weight mandated by Group B rules.

Ferrari drivers extensively tested the 308 GT/M at Fiorano from 1984 to 1986. With racing tyres fitted, the 308 GT/M lapped Fiorano in 1 minute, 24.6 seconds, faster than both the F40 (1:25) and 512 BB/LM (1:26.6). The car accelerated from 0- in less than 4 seconds. Ferrari designed the car to reach a top speed of at a 8500 rpm redline in 5th gear.

Three 308 GT/M chassis were constructed, numbered 001, 002 and 003. Chassis 001 was completed in 1984 and subsequently used as a test mule by Ferrari to develop the design, including extensive track testing at Fiorano Circuit. By June 1984, it was sold to Belgian driver Jean &quot;Beurlys&quot; Blaton. Blaton raced the car occasionally in local Belgian rallies. Chassis 002 was entered in the 1984 Rally di Monza, where it was driven by Raffaele &quot;Lele&quot; Pinto. Under wet conditions, Pinto damaged the rear suspension and finished 4th, trailing a &quot;conventional&quot; Gr.B 308 GTB. 002 was repaired and subsequently used as a road car by a private owner. Chassis 003 was built for a Dutch driver, Henk Koel. Construction of 003 began in Fall of 1986 and was completed in April 1987. Chassis 003 was never used in rally racing, but has appeared at multiple Ferrari track events.

<text>The Algoma Central Railway is a railway in Northern Ontario, Canada, that operates between Sault Ste. Marie and Hearst. It used to have a branch line to Wawa. The area served by the railway is sparsely populated, with few roads.

The railway is well known for its Agawa Canyon tour train. Until 2015, the line also provided passenger train service to canoeists, snowmobilers, cottagers and tourists accessing this wilderness recreation region. The railway connects at its northernmost point with the Ontario Northland Railway and with CN&#x27;s eastern division to the south. It also intersects with the Canadian Pacific Kansas City at Franz and with the Huron Central Railway at its southernmost point in the Sault.

==History==
===Early history===

The Algoma Central Railway was first owned by Francis H. Clergue, who required a railway to haul resources from the interior of the Algoma District to Clergue&#x27;s industries in Sault Ste. Marie; specifically, to transport logs to his pulp mill and iron ore from the Helen Mine, near Wawa, to a proposed steel mill (which was later named Algoma Steel). The Algoma Central Railway was chartered on August 11, 1899. The railway&#x27;s Dominion and provincial charters gave it authority to build north from Sault Ste. Marie to a junction with the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s main line, as well as a branch line to Michipicoten Harbour, on Lake Superior near Wawa.

In 1901, Clergue acquired the charter of the Ontario, Hudson Bay and Western Railway, which was intending to build a line between the CPR main line and Hudson Bay. He then changed the name of the Algoma Central Railway to The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company, anticipating a connection either to Moose Factory on James Bay or to some point on Hudson Bay.

The Algoma Central fell victim to the bankruptcy of Clergue&#x27;s Consolidated Lake Superior Company in 1903. At that time, the line reached north of Sault Ste. Marie, with a segment running east from Michipicoten Harbour that did not yet connect with the main line. Construction was stopped, but it was subsequently resumed in 1909 and the line was extended northward through to junctions with the Michipicoten Harbour branch (at Hawk Junction), the Canadian Pacific Railway (at Franz) and the Canadian Northern Railway (at Oba). In 1914, it finally reached Hearst, a town north of Sault Ste. Marie that was a divisional point on the National Transcontinental Railway. By that point, Clergue&#x27;s dream of building a railway to Hudson Bay or James Bay had long been abandoned, and the railway&#x27;s northern terminus remained at Hearst, around from James Bay. However, the phrase &quot;and Hudson Bay&quot; was not removed from the railway&#x27;s name until June 30, 1965.

The Algoma Central was the first Canadian railway to operate fully with diesel fuel, in 1952.

The railway had been in the shipping business since 1900, when it had purchased four steamships. Starting during the 1960s, the railway greatly expanded its marine operations and diversified into trucking, real estate, forestry, and mining operations. These operations were more profitable than the railway operations, and on April 30, 1990, as part of a corporate reorganization, the name of the company was changed to Algoma Central Corporation, with the Algoma Central Railway becoming one of its subsidiaries. A few years later, the Algoma Central Railway was put up for sale.

===Wisconsin Central and Canadian National eras===
On February 1, 1995, Wisconsin Central Ltd. purchased Algoma Central Railway Incorporated, operating the railway as a separate subsidiary, Wisconsin Central Canada Holdings. In 1998, Algoma Steel closed its iron ore mine in Wawa and the branch line between Michipicoten Harbour and Hawk Junction was abandoned. Wisconsin Central Ltd. was acquired by Canadian National on October 9, 2001, whereupon the Algoma Central became part of CN&#x27;s Eastern Division.

In January 2014, CN announced it was cutting the service from Sault Ste. Marie to Hearst, blaming the Canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running. The passenger service, which runs three days per week, provides year-round access to remote tourist camps and resorts. The average annual ridership is estimated to be 10,600 passengers. It has been argued in the past as an essential service; however, the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic.

In February, a working group attempting to save the line hired BDO Canada LLP, an accounting firm, to assess the financial impact to the region when the service is scheduled to end April 29. The working group, composed of municipalities, first nations, and cottager associations, all had a vested interest in the continuation of the service. According to preliminary findings, BDO determined passenger rail service in the Algoma district generates between $38 million and $48 million in annual economic activity. It supports as many as 220 jobs and delivers more than $5 million in tax revenues.

In April 2014, the federal government extended funding for one year so that CN would continue to provide the passenger service. The $2.2-million subsidy was to facilitate the provision of service until 2015. In March 2015, Railmark Canada Ltd assumed the passenger service with the intention to increase services and marketing.

In March 2015, the Canadian government guaranteed funding of the service for an additional three years.

In June of the same year, Canadian National said it would stop the service on July 15 after it was unable to make a deal with Railmark Canada. The government subsidy still stood, but a new rail operator needed to be sought by the regional stakeholders group. Railmark was unable to secure a line of credit from a lending group, which hindered its ability to take over services.

In 2017, the Missanabie Cree First Nation started investigating taking operational control of the line.

Canadian National announced its intent in July 2020 to sell off non-core lines in the Upper Midwest as part of a rationalization programme, all of which were previously part of the Wisconsin Central system. In December 2021, the sale of the former Algoma Central lines along with CN trackage in Wisconsin and Michigan was approved by the Surface Transportation Board.

===Watco purchase===

In March 2021, Watco announced that it would acquire the Algoma Central from Canadian National, along with the Wisconsin lines, sale of the latter being subject to final approval by the United States Surface Transportation Board. Simultaneously, Watco committed to a continuance of the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, as well as signing a memorandum of understanding with the Missanabie Cree First Nation regarding a potential partnership. On April 20, the Missanabie Cree First Nation, N1 Strategy Inc. and The Machine Shop also signed a memorandum of understanding around logistics and operations of a resurrected tourist train. The purchase closed in 2022, with Watco operating under the name Agawa Canyon Railroad up to Oba, with Canadian National retaining the line from Oba to Hearst.

== Tourism ==

=== Agawa Canyon Tour Train ===
In the 1960s, the railway began to promote the natural beauty of the District of Algoma to tourists, especially the Agawa Canyon, a canyon carved by the Agawa River, located 114 rail miles (183 km) north of Sault Ste. Marie, and not accessible by road. The Algoma Central developed a tourist stopover here and it proved to be a great success for the railway. Owing to the popularity of the Agawa Canyon excursions, the Algoma Central ran the longest passenger trains in North America, often up to 20 to 24 cars long. During the 1970s and 1980s, around 100,000 people per year visited Agawa Canyon.

The Agawa Canyon Tour Train has continued to operate as a separate entity since 2015. The 2020 season of the Agawa Canyon tour train was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During 2023 the tour train runs from early August to mid-October.

=== Moments of Algoma Group of Seven ===
In 2015, White Pine Pictures released the award-winning documentary film &quot;Painted Land: in Search of the Group of Seven&quot; which was shot along the rail corridor. In 2016 the Moments of Algoma project was launched by the Algoma Kinniwabi Travel Association, inviting tourists to follow the Group of Seven&#x27;s travels, experiences and expressions of the region. The driving tour begins in Bruce Mines and follows the shoreline of Lake Huron and Lake Superior as far as Nipigon. Rail passengers will find more interpretive Installations in Agawa Canyon and at the train station in Sault Ste. Marie.

==In popular culture==
The railway is the subject of the song &quot;Algoma Central 69&quot; by Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors.

The Agawa Canyon Tour Train has continued to operate as a separate entity since 2015.

<doc id="1178108" wikidata="Q1083571" url="?curid=1178108" title="Malaysia–Singapore Second Link">
<text>The Malaysia–Singapore Second Link (, ) is a bridge connecting Singapore and Johor, Malaysia. In Singapore, it is officially known as the Tuas Second Link. The bridge was built to reduce the traffic congestion at the Johor–Singapore Causeway and was opened to traffic on 2 January 1998. It was officially opened by Singapore&#x27;s then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong with Mahathir Mohamad, who was then Prime Minister of Malaysia. The bridge supports a dual-three lane carriageway linking Kampong Ladang at Tanjung Kupang, Johor to Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim at Tuas, Singapore. The total length of the bridge over water is . The actual distance between both checkpoints is approximately .
At Malaysian side, the bridge is connected to the Second Link Expressway (Malay: &quot;Lebuhraya Laluan Kedua Malaysia–Singapura&quot;) E3 also known as &quot;Linkedua Expressway&quot;, which links from Senai North Interchange Exit 253 at North–South Expressway E2, Senai Airport and Taman Perling, Johor Bahru via its extension known as Johor Bahru Parkway E3. In Singapore, the bridge connects to the Ayer Rajah Expressway.

The checkpoint on Malaysia side is called the Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ Complex (Kompleks Sultan Abu Bakar). The checkpoint on Singapore side, the Tuas Checkpoint, was built on of reclaimed land at a cost of S$485 million. Designed by CPG Corporation, it involved the use of of concrete and of reinforcing steel, and won the Architectural Design Award and Best Buildable Design Award awarded by the Singapore Institute of Architects and the Building and Construction Authority respectively. Travelling along the Second Link usually takes less time than the Causeway due to smoother traffic in both directions; however, during festive periods (especially Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Christmas and Deepavali) the dense traffic between Malaysia and Singapore still leads to massive jams on both bridges.

Unlike its shorter counterparts in Woodlands, as Tuas Checkpoint is designated as a vehicular checkpoint only, travellers are not allowed to arrive at the checkpoint by foot.

==Access from other roads==
===From Malaysia===


The approach to the bridge is via the Second Link Expressway, which can be accessed by exiting the North–South Expressway (E2) at Exit 253 Senai North Interchange. Alternatively, motorists can also enter the expressway via Taman Perling which also joins with Pasir Gudang Highway (Federal Route 17 and Skudai Highway (Federal route 1). The expressway link to Taman Perling is also known as Pontian–Johor Bahru Parkway.

===From Singapore===
The bridge is directly accessed via the Ayer Rajah Expressway, along with other supporting roads around the vicinity of the Tuas industrial area.

==History==

The idea of building a second link between Malaysia and Singapore was first raised in July 1980 by then-Menteri Besar of Johor, Othman Saat. Gelang Patah was raised as a viable site due to its distant proximity from Johor Bahru, and the suggestion was raised to tackle growing traffic jams on the causeway. The Malaysian federal Government welcomed Othman&#x27;s plan, and the Johor State Government formed a committee to study the feasibility of building the second link.

In July 1989, United Engineers Malaysia Berhad (UEM) submitted a proposal to the government of Malaysia to privatise the construction of a second link to Singapore. The acceptance of the proposal brought about the signing of a concession agreement in July 1993, giving exclusive rights and authority to UEM to design, construct, manage, operate and maintain the bridge and expressways for a period of 30 years commencing 27 July 1993.

Following this, a novation agreement was executed in May 1994, whereby UEM assigned all its rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of the concession agreement to Linkedua (Malaysia) Berhad, a wholly owned subsidiary of UEM.

The construction of the bridge required the co-operation of the government of Malaysia and the government of Singapore. On 22 March 1994, an inter-government agreement was signed defining the responsibilities of both governments with regard to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the bridge. Each government was responsible for the construction of the portion the bridge which fell within its borders, based on a common agreed design. A joint committee comprising representatives of each government was formed to oversee the implementation of this Malaysia–Singapore Second Crossing project.

The major components of the project are the Second Crossing bridge, forty-four kilometres of expressways, a Customs, Immigration and Quarantine complex, three toll plazas, two rest and service areas and other ancillary facilities. The bridge was designed to accommodate up to 200,000 vehicles a day.

The Second Link was opened to traffic on 2 January 1998. It was officially opened on 18 April the same year by the Prime Ministers of both countries, namely Dato&#x27; Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia and Goh Chok Tong of Singapore.

On 16 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, Malaysia Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that Malaysia would be implementing a movement control order which would start from 18 March. Due to the movement order, the Causeway faced immense jams due to a surge of Malaysians returning to Malaysia and back to Singapore before the order took effect. All bus services could not enter Johor Bahru for two weeks from 18 March to 31 March 2020. However, the flow of cargo, goods and food supplies carried on as normal.

<doc id="1178117" wikidata="Q2916171" url="?curid=1178117" title="Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Prague">
<text>The Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul () is a neo-Gothic collegiate and parish church in Vyšehrad fortress in Prague, Czech Republic.

Founded in 1070–1080 by the King Vratislaus II of Bohemia, the Romanesque basilica suffered a fire in the year 1249 and has been rebuilt in Gothic and later in neo-Gothic style. The basilica features an impressive stone mosaic above its entry, and its twin 58 m towers can be seen atop a hill to the south from along the Vltava River in central Prague.

Behind the church is located large park and Vyšehrad cemetery, the final resting place of many famous Czechs, including author Karel Čapek and composer Antonín Dvořák. In 2003 the church was elevated to basilica by Pope John Paul II.

==Exterior==

The current building itself is a neo-Gothic basilica. It was constructed between 1887 and 1903. The first master builder was Joseph Mocker but he died mid-way through construction. It was finished by his partner František Mikš who modified the façade and tower designs from Mocker&#x27;s original plans. The main part of the church consists of a nave with two side aisles; a large choir, sanctuary and apse; and two side rooms which hold a sacristy and a chapel for Panna Maria Šancovská Our Lady of the Ramparts.

There is no transept. Structurally, the building is quite vertical, its ceiling is cross vaulted and the pointed arched windows let in the sun&#x27;s light through stained glass. A few meters east of where the church now stands beyond the cemetery walls the original foundations from the apse of the old Gothic church were excavated. The old apse and the new apse are designed in the same fashion; they are both buttressed and have the same number of buttresses.

The western façade features three vestibules, two towers, and a crowning triangular gable between the towers. The main portal tympanum is decorated by Jesus standing with his apostles. Below them the archangel Michael stands between people being ushered to heaven by angels, and people crippled by the suffering of sin. On the gable face stand sculptures of the basilica&#x27;s namesake saints Peter and Paul with angels and Jesus.

Another interesting feature of the St. Paul and Peter&#x27;s Basilica design is the spires, which are hollow. They have slender holes making the tops of the towers light and elegant reminiscent of the conic formation of the chestnut flowers one can find blooming in trees along the walkways in the Vyšehrad complex. The spires (and indeed the triangular gable of the façade between them) are frilled with petal like finial protrusions along their length and on their tops, further connecting their likeness to the flower.

==Interior==
History is the dominant element thematically of the interior décor; the history of art, Christianity and the Czech lands are all aspects of the decoration. As a piece of art history the church is something of an exhibition of Gothic, art nouveau and even Baroque pieces.

Along with the design of the building the main altar, the pulpit, and all the smaller altars in the side chapels are neo Gothic as well. They are intricately carved with mini-spires and tracery throughout. Even the organ which sits above the entrance has hollow spires matching those of the western towers. In addition, each chapel contains Gothic revival paintings. The theme of the stained glass windows is the history of Gothic architecture; each window portrays Jesus before a different Gothic or neo-Gothic church. Completing the tribute to the Gothic style is a large fresco at the eastern end of the northern aisle of the first Gothic church to stand on the spot. The original picture copied for the painting is taken from the book by J.F. Hammerschmidt from the year 1700, but its architectural accuracy must be questioned because it is a romantic engraving made over 100 years after the Gothic church existed.

Also, in each chapel are large baroque paintings from the 16th century, maintaining the link to another part of the church&#x27;s past; the last building to be on the spot was a baroque church built in the first quarter of the 18th century. It had no towers, but the façade was quite decorative including a great number of ionic pillars.

Seemingly every inch of the walls, pillars and ceilings is covered with the ornate, flowing decoration of the painter František Urban and his wife Marie Urbanová-Zahradnická inspired by Alfons Mucha. Nameless winged women flank the archways from the nave and fill the vault sections of the arcades. Up the pillars and along every picture&#x27;s border run floral patterns and colourful ribbons. The vivid greens and browns which cover the entirety of the interior create a feeling of being inside a forest. The ceiling of the nave is dark green, as if it is a canopy in shadow. Even the brown wooden benches on the ground for the beholders of church services are ornately carved with oak leaves.

== Restoration ==
The Basilica is undergoing significant roof restoration due to damage and leaks. The project involves replacing the original slate tiles with new ones imported from the United States and Spain, adhering to the design by architect Josef Mocker. The restoration, estimated to cost around CZK 45 million, is supported by subsidies from the Ministry of Culture and the Prague City Council, with additional funds raised through public collections and the sale of commemorative items.The restoration of the basilica is to be completed in 2029.

<doc id="1178120" wikidata="Q3301511" url="?curid=1178120" title="Headline News (&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song)">
<text>&quot;Headline News&quot; is a parody song by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. It is a parody of the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; 1993 hit &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. It was released as the lead-off single for the compilation box set &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot; on September 27, 1994. The song was written after Yankovic&#x27;s label insisted he craft a new song to promote the album; Yankovic in turn combined the music of the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; song with three news stories that were popular in late 1993 and early 1994.

To help promote the song and album, Yankovic directed a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; original. In it, the three news stories are presented as if they are one-act plays to an audience. The song&#x27;s video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for production, costing the record label a considerable amount of money. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, including Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento, and Judy Tenuta.

The song and video were met with mostly positive reviews from critics, although at least one critic for &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; felt that the source material was already dated upon the single&#x27;s release. Crash Test Dummies themselves were pleased with the final result and even performed the song with Yankovic in concert twice. &quot;Headline News&quot; charted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, making it Yankovic&#x27;s first single to chart domestically since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;.

==Writing==
While Yankovic was writing the original songs for a new album—which was later released in 1996 as &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;—his label, Scotti Brothers Records, insisted that he release a new record in order to meet monetary projections for the fourth fiscal quarter of the year. Yankovic, however, explained that he would be unable to finish a new record in time, so his label decided to release a box set entitled &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot;. The label then stipulated that Yankovic would need to at least record a new single to promote the box set.

Due to this demand, Yankovic nearly had Scotti Brothers cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure before turning to the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; recent hit &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. Yankovic had heard the song earlier in the year and, at the time, believed that it had the potential to be parodied on his next studio album. However, after Scotti Brothers insisted that he record a new song to promote &quot;Permanent Record&quot;, Yankovic decided to feature a Crash Test Dummies parody as the set&#x27;s lead single. Yankovic later realized that by releasing &quot;Headline News&quot; on the &quot;Permanent Record&quot; set rather than wait to include it on his next album, he could capitalize on the topicality of the parody&#x27;s lyrics.

While each verse of &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; told the story of a different abnormal child, the verses in &quot;Headline News&quot; recount three famous tabloid stories of 1993 and 1994: the American vandal Michael Fay being caned in Singapore, figure skater Tonya Harding&#x27;s ex-husband attacking her rival Nancy Kerrigan, and Lorena Bobbitt severing her husband&#x27;s penis with a knife. (When singing about the latter story, Yankovic substitutes the term &quot;penis&quot; with euphemisms like &quot;wiener&quot; and &quot;Mr. Happy&quot;.) Yankovic later joked that he &quot;wanted to write a song about these people because he didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting quite enough media attention&quot;—a reference to the stories&#x27; over-saturation in the news.

==Recording==

Recording for the song began on July 27, 1994, at Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California. Yankovic himself produced the song. Backing Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, Jim West on guitar, and Kim Bullard on keyboards. Lisa Popeil provides the female backup vocals, as well as the scream of Nancy Kerrigan. The song also features idiosyncratic sonic elements to increase the humor, such as: manualist sound effects courtesy of Mike Kieffer; a chorus of kazoos, which joins in during the song&#x27;s outro; and Yankovic playing a short riff on his trademark instrument, the accordion. Due to the vocal parts of the original song being in such a low register, Yankovic had to record the parody&#x27;s vocal tracks early in the morning, when his voice was naturally lower.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Headline News&quot; parodies the &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; video in that it presents each news story as a one-act play on stage before an audience of people. The video was directed by Yankovic, making it his third directoral credit after 1986&#x27;s &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot;. Yankovic appears as Brad Roberts, and his band appears as the other members of the Crash Test Dummies; notably, the video also marks the on-screen debut of Yankovic&#x27;s official keyboardist, Rubén Valtierra, who appears in drag as Ellen Reid. The video was filmed on August 29 and 31, 1994. All of the scenes that took place at the school were filmed during the day at Longfellow Elementary School Auditorium, in Pasadena, California. The scenes at the ice rink were filmed at night in a rink in Paramount, California. According to Yankovic, the crew ran over time and it was a rather expensive video. Yankovic noted that &quot;without giving you the actual number&quot;, he could have &quot;recorded two albums, probably, for what it cost to do that one video.&quot; The video features several celebrity cameos, including an appearance by Doug Llewelyn of &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; fame, and long time radio show host Dr. Demento. Comedian Judy Tenuta also appears as Lorena Bobbitt. The cast also includes Danny Fehsenfeld as Michael Fay, Laura Pursell as Tonya Harding, Maria Causey-Nelson as Nancy Kerrigan, and Sal Rendino as John Bobbitt

==Release==

===Reception===

&quot;Headline News&quot; was released on September 26, 1994, as the lead-off single for &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot;, which was also released a day later. Yankovic also insisted that the song be commercially available as a CD single so that his fans who are completists would not have to purchase the expensive box set just to get the new song. Much like the cover for the Crash Test Dummies&#x27;s 1993 studio album &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot;, the cover for Yankovic&#x27;s single superimposes his face over the figures of Titian&#x27;s painting &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;. The art direction is credited to Doug Haverty, and design is credit to Daniel Sorenson, David McDougall. The b-side of &quot;Headline News&quot; was a remix of Yankovic&#x27;s 1986 original song &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot;. The song was never officially released on a studio album, although it did appear on Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits Volume II&quot; album, which was released a month later on October 25, 1994. The single charted and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which corresponds to a position of 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This made it Yankovic&#x27;s first domestically charting single since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;.

Brad Roberts, the original songwriter for &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was extremely pleased with the parody, and found it humorous. He later noted, &quot;People assume that I was annoyed but when [Yankovic] does a parody of you, you know you&#x27;ve made it.&quot; He later praised the way Yankovic interacted with the artists that he parodies: &quot;Weird Al goes the whole route and cultivates a relationship with the artist. Plus he gets half the earnings and that helps me make money.&quot;

===Reviews===
&quot;Headline News&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Lou Carlozo of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the song &quot;provided savage laughs at the expense of Tonya Harding and John Bobbitt.&quot; Roch Parisien of AllMusic cited the song as one of the three stand-outs from Yankovic&#x27;s second greatest hits volume, and called it a &quot;rib-tickler&quot;. Tina Maps of &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; wrote a positive review and felt that the musical parody was a &quot;dead-on skewering of the Crash Test Dummies&#x27; &#x27;Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm&quot;. Not all reviews, however, were so positive; an article that appeared in &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; noted that while the video for &quot;Headline News&quot; had some &quot;cute bits and unusual cameos&quot;, it was &quot;not as clever as many of Yankovic&#x27;s past efforts&quot; and that &quot;the current events included here are already dated&quot;.

===Live performances===
Yankovic first started performing &quot;Headline News&quot; in August 1994, almost a month before it was officially released. In addition, Yankovic has performed the song with the Crash Test Dummies twice: once on Canada&#x27;s MuchMusic channel and another time at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. Reportedly, during one of the performances, Ellen Reid, backing vocalist and keyboardist for the Crash Test Dummies, went out and purchased kazoos. The band then hid the instruments until the end of the song, when they took them out and played them; this &quot;came as a big surprise to&quot; Yankovic. Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot; concert tour contained new lyrics as part of a parody medley, referencing Britney Spears, dealing with her 2007 head-shaving shock and underpants-less limousine trip in late 2006. Later in the tour, he changed it to reference Paris Hilton&#x27;s DUI and imprisonment, and her subsequent interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;.

<text>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is the national governing body for tennis in the United States. A not-for-profit organization with more than 700,000 members, it invests 100% of its proceeds to promote and develop the growth of tennis, from the grass-roots to the professional levels. The association was created to standardize rules and regulations and to promote and develop the growth of tennis in the United States.

The USTA runs the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center which hosts the US Open every year.

The USTA has leagues in most places for adults skill levels between beginner and pro. The USTA also hosts tournaments across the country every weekend for club players or professionals.

==History==
The USTA was previously known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) and was established in 1881 by a small group of tennis club members in New York City and northeastern clubs, where most lawn tennis was played. In 1920 the word &#x27;National&#x27; was dropped from the organization&#x27;s name, making the abbreviation &quot;USLTA&quot;. In 1975, the word &quot;Lawn&quot; was officially dropped from the name.

==Organization==
The USTA has 17 geographical sections with more than 700,000 individual members, 7,000 organizational members, and a professional staff. The USTA (B)team is located in White Plains, NY. The (A) team is located at the National Campus located in Orlando, FL.

==NTRP Ratings==

The USTA (along with the USPTA) created the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP) or more commonly NTRP ratings to place players into various skill levels. NTRP ratings range from the beginner 1.5 with .5 increments all the way up to 7.0 or world-class players. NTRP ratings are used in the leagues and tournaments to help provide more compatible matches. At the end of each calendar year, the USTA calculates and publishes everyone&#x27;s year-end rating online (http://tennislink.usta.com). Ratings are calculated using a computer algorithm that adjusts ratings based on how actual outcomes compare to expected outcomes for each match. Expected outcomes are determined based on the difference between the ratings in hundredths of the players on the court. How many matches you&#x27;ve won and if it was a singles or doubles match is not a part of the calculation. New players or anyone with an expired NTRP rating go through the self-rate process to determine their entry point. Specific answers to a series of questions allow the computer to provide a suggested rating for players to start.

==Programs==
The USTA hosts adult tournaments in most cities with populations over 150,000 people. Leagues for adults with ratings ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 are organized in the Spring and/or Fall. In most areas, the adult seasons consist of singles, doubles, and mixed doubles leagues in the Spring. Fewer cities have Fall leagues for singles and/or alternate league types such as &quot;combo&quot;, &quot;mixed combo&quot;, or &quot;tri-level&quot;. 

In most states, there are between one and five tournaments each weekend. Adults with a 3.0 to 4.5 rating can usually play in these tournaments. 
Leagues include: 10 and under; Juniors; Adults 18-40; and Adults 40 or older. Anyone over 40 may request placement in the 18-40 league.

==Tournaments==
There are 11 active ATP tournaments held in the United States. Nine are held on hard courts, one on clay, and one on grass. USA hosts one Grand Slam, three Masters, two 500, and five 250 level tournaments.

===Discontinued awards===
* USTA Girls’ Sportsmanship Trophy Award - The USTA Girls’ Sportsmanship Trophy Award was presented annually at the close of the International Girls’ 18 Grass Court Championships to the player in the championship who, in the opinion of the committee of judges, most nearly approaches the ideal in sportsmanship, appearance, court manners and tactics. The trophy was first presented in 1936 by the late Mrs. Harrison Smith and was henceforth awarded annually. The trophy was a sterling silver plate. The name of the recipient of the award was engraved on the trophy every year and a small silver plate similar to the trophy in design and engraving was given to the recipient. The award was retired in 2004 and donated to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
* Harry Fogleman Memorial Trophy - The Harry Fogleman Memorial Trophy was awarded each year at the USTA Boys’ 12 National Championships to the boy who, in the opinion of the Tournament Committee, exemplified outstanding sportsmanship, conduct, character and tennis ability.

Mr. Fogleman was not only an outstanding tennis coach but served on various committees of the USTA devoted to Junior development. For several years he was Tournament Director of the 12 and 14 National Championships in Chattanooga, TN. Before his sudden death in December 1972, he was honored as the 1972 recipient of the Tennis Educational Foundation Merit Award given annually by the USTA. The trophy was displayed by the club which hosted the Boys’ 12 National Championships. The winner of the award was given a suitably inscribed pewter replica as a memento of his achievement. It was retired in 1989.
* Colonel James H. Bishop Award - The Colonel James H. Bishop Award was presented annually at a place and time determined by the USTA Junior Davis Cup Committee Chairman to that U.S. Junior Davis Cup squad member who, in the opinion of the chairman and the team captains, best exemplified the objectives of the Junior Davis Cup Program in regard to highest standards of character, conduct, sportsmanship, appearance, amateurism on and off the tennis court, and tennis accomplishment. The award, a sterling silver tray, was donated by Dorothy W. and Thomas E. Price to the USTA in memory of Colonel James H. Bishop—the founder of the Junior Davis Cup Program in 1937 (the forerunner of the Junior Wightman Cup Program in 1938) and a well-known and highly regarded friend of youth, educator, and tennis leader until his untimely death in 1961. The name of the recipient of the award was engraved on the tray and a suitably inscribed small silver replica was given to the recipient as a memento of the award. The last award in 1987 was to Patrick McEnroe.
* William M. Johnston Award - The William M. Johnston Trophy was awarded to that male player who, by character, sportsmanship, manners, spirit of cooperation and contribution to the growth of the game, ranks first in the opinion of the selection committee. Another basis for the award was the help a player renders not only to players in the recipient&#x27;s own class but also to a lesser class and to junior players as well. The award was the result of a suggestion by the late “Little Bill” Johnston, who gave one of his championship cups to the International Lawn Tennis Club of the United States to be used for this purpose. The name of the winner of the award was engraved on the trophy, and a small silver tray suitably inscribed was given to the recipient as a memento of the award. It was awarded from 1947 through 2006.
* Sarah Palfrey Danzig Award - The Sarah Palfrey Danzig Trophy was awarded to that female player who, by character, sportsmanship, manners, spirit of cooperation and contribution to the growth of the game, ranks first in the opinion of the selection committee. Another basis of the award was the help a player renders not only to players of her own class but also to players of a lesser class and to junior players. The award was the result of a suggestion by the late Mrs. Danzig that it was fitting and proper that there should be an award for women comparable to and with the same criteria as the William M. Johnston Award for men. To that end, she gave one of her national championship cups to the International Lawn Tennis Club of the United States to be used for this purpose. The name of the winner was engraved on the trophy, and a silver tray suitably inscribed was given to the recipient as a memento of the award. Awarded from 1986 through 2006.

<doc id="1178134" wikidata="Q880661" url="?curid=1178134" title="Black Codes (United States)">
<text>The Black Codes, sometimes called the Black Laws, were laws which governed the conduct of African Americans (both free and freedmen). In 1832, James Kent wrote that &quot;in most of the United States, there is a distinction in respect to political privileges, between free white persons and free colored persons of African blood; and in no part of the country do the latter, in point of fact, participate equally with the whites, in the exercise of civil and political rights.&quot; Although Black Codes existed before the Civil War and although many Northern states had them, the Southern U.S. states codified such laws in everyday practice. The best known of these laws were passed by Southern states in 1865 and 1866, after the Civil War, in order to restrict African Americans&#x27; freedom, and in order to compel them to work for either low or no wages.

Since the colonial period, colonies and states had passed laws that discriminated against free Blacks. In the South, these were generally included in &quot;slave codes&quot;; the goal was to suppress the influence of free blacks (particularly after slave rebellions) because of their potential influence on slaves. Free men of color were denied the vote in the North Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1835. Restrictions included bearing arms, gathering in groups for worship, and learning to read and write. The purpose of these laws was to preserve slavery in slave societies.

Before the war, the Northern states that had prohibited slavery also enacted laws similar to the slave codes and the later Black Codes: Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and New York enacted laws to discourage free blacks from residing in those states. They were denied equal political rights, including the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, and the right to equal treatment under the law. Some of the Northern states, those which had them, repealed such laws around the same time that the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment.

In the first two years after the Civil War, white legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. (The name &quot;Black Codes&quot; was given by &quot;negro leaders and the Republican organs&quot;, according to historian John S. Reynolds.) Black Codes were part of a larger pattern of Democrats trying to maintain political dominance and suppress the freedmen, newly emancipated African-Americans. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes. The defining feature of the Black Codes was broad vagrancy law, which allowed local authorities to arrest freed people for minor infractions and commit them to involuntary labor. This period was the start of the convict lease system, also described as &quot;slavery by another name&quot; by Douglas Blackmon in his 2008 book of this title.

==Background==
Vagrancy laws date to the end of feudalism in Europe. Introduced by aristocratic and landowning classes, they had the dual purpose of restricting access of &quot;undesirable&quot; classes to public spaces and of ensuring a labor pool. Serfs were not emancipated from their land.

==Before the Civil War ==

===Southern states===
&quot;Black Codes&quot; in the antebellum South strongly regulated the activities and behavior of blacks, especially free Blacks, who were not considered citizens. Chattel slaves basically lived under the complete control of their owners, so there was little need for extensive legislation. &quot;All Southern states imposed at least minimal limits on slave punishment, for example, by making murder or life-threatening injury of slaves a crime, and a few states allowed slaves a limited right of self-defense.&quot; As slaves could not use the courts or sheriff, or give testimony against a white man, in practice these meant little.

North Carolina restricted slaves from leaving their plantation; if a male slave wished to court a female slave on another property, he needed a pass in order to pursue this relationship. Without one he risked severe punishment at the hands of the patrollers.

Free blacks presented a challenge to the boundaries of white-dominated society. In many Southern states, particularly after Nat Turner&#x27;s insurrection of 1831, they were denied the rights of citizens to assemble in groups, bear arms, learn to read and write, exercise free speech, or testify against white people in Court. After 1810, states made manumissions of slaves more difficult to obtain, in some states requiring an act of the legislature for each case of manumission. This sharply reduced the incidence of planters freeing slaves.

All the slave states passed anti-miscegenation laws, banning the marriage of white and black people.

Between 1687 and 1865, Virginia enacted more than 130 slave statutes, among which were seven major slave codes, with some containing more than fifty provisions.

Maryland passed vagrancy and apprentice laws, and required Blacks to obtain licenses from Whites before doing business. It prohibited immigration of free Blacks until 1865. Most of the Maryland Black Code was repealed in the Constitution of 1867. Black women were not allowed to testify against white men with whom they had children, giving them a status similar to wives.

On the 8th of February, 1820 the city of Charleston, South Carolina passed an ordinance authorizing the city to impose a &quot;tax&quot; of one dollar for &quot;each and every free male Negro or person of color&quot; who was found to be wearing a pocket watch. The same ordinance also imposed a $10 per year tax on free black tradesmen, an $8 tax on free black men, and a $5 tax on all free black women residing in the city.

===Northern states===

As the abolitionist movement gained force and the Underground Railroad helped fugitive slaves escape to the North, concern about Black people heightened among Northern white people. Territories and states near the slave states did not welcome freed Black people. But north of the Mason–Dixon line, anti-Black laws were generally less severe. Some public spaces were segregated, and Black people generally did not have the right to vote. In Oregon, Black people were forbidden to settle, marry, or sign contracts. In Ohio, Black people required a certificate they were free and a good behavior bond.

All the slave states passed anti-miscegenation laws, banning the marriage of white and Black people, as did three of the five states carved from the Northwest Territory: Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. The territory was free since its inception, though Indiana and Illinois shared borders with slave states, as did Ohio. Ohio&#x27;s position was noteworthy in this regard for being the only state that, alone, bridged the lands of oppressions faced by black people in the American South to lands of freedom and security offered in British Canada north of the great lakes. This status, in addition to a well-mobilized network of abolitionist sympathizers, ensured Ohio became an essential expressway on the underground railroad network. Officially, however, the dual proximity to the South and North resulted in some legislative anomalies and oxymoronic policy.

The population of the southern parts of the old Northwest states had generally migrated from the Upper South; their culture and values were more akin to those of the South across the river than those of the northern settlers, who had migrated from New England and New York. In some states these codes included vagrancy laws that targeted unemployed Black people, apprentice laws that made Black orphans and dependents available for hire to white people, and commercial laws that excluded Black people from certain trades and businesses and restricted their ownership of property.

The Indiana Legislature decreed in 1843 that only white students could attend the public schools. Article 13 of Indiana&#x27;s 1851 Constitution banned Black people from settling in the state. Anyone who helped Black people settle in the state or employed Black settlers could be fined. Article 13 had the most popular vote among Hoosiers compared to all other articles voted upon. The Supreme Court declared Article 13 invalid in 1866.

The 1848 Constitution of Illinois contributed to the state legislature passing one of the harshest Black Code systems in the nation until the Civil War. The Illinois Black Code of 1853 prohibited any Black persons from outside of the state from staying in the state for more than ten days, subjecting Black people who violated that rule to arrest, detention, a $50 fine, or deportation. However, while slavery was illegal in Illinois, landowners in the southern parts of the state would legally bring in slaves from adjacent Kentucky, and force them to do agricultural work for no wages. They had to be removed from the state for one day each year, thus preventing them from being citizens of Illinois and receiving the protection of its laws. A campaign to repeal these laws was led by John Jones, Chicago&#x27;s most prominent black citizen. In December 1850, Jones circulated a petition—signed by black residents of the state—for Illinois legislators to repeal the Black Laws. In 1864, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published Jones&#x27; pamphlet, “The Black Laws of Illinois and a Few Reasons Why They Should Be Repealed.” It was not until 1865 that Illinois repealed the state&#x27;s provision of its Black Laws.

In some states, Black Code legislation used text directly from the slave codes, simply substituting &quot;Negro&quot; or other words in place of &quot;slave&quot;.

==Under Union occupation==
The Union Army relied on the labor of newly freed people, and did not always treat them fairly. Thomas W. Knox wrote: &quot;The difference between working for nothing as a slave, and working for the same wages under the Yankees, was not always perceptible.&quot; At the same time, military officials resisted local attempts to apply pre-war laws to the freed people. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army conscripted Black &quot;vagrants&quot; and sometimes others.

The Union Army applied the northern wage system of free labor to freedmen after the Emancipation Proclamation; they effectively upgraded free Blacks from &quot;contraband&quot; status. General Nathaniel P. Banks in Louisiana initiated a system of wage labor in February 1863 in Louisiana; General Lorenzo Thomas implemented a similar system in Mississippi. The Banks-Thomas system offered Blacks $10 a month, with the Army&#x27;s commitment to provide rations, clothing, and medicine. The worker would have to agree to an unbreakable one-year contract. In 1864, Thomas expanded the system to Tennessee, and allowed white landowners near the Nashville contraband camp to rent the labor of refugees.

Against opposition from elements of the Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln accepted this system as a step on the path to gradual emancipation. Abolitionists continued to criticize the labor system. Wendell Phillips said that Lincoln&#x27;s proclamation had &quot;free[d] the slave, but ignore[d] the Negro&quot;, calling the Banks-Thomas year-long contracts tantamount to serfdom. The &quot;Worcester Spy&quot; described the government&#x27;s answer to slavery as &quot;something worse than failure.&quot;

==Post-Civil War years==

As the war ended, the U.S. Army implemented Black Codes to regulate the behavior of black people in general society. Although the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau had a mandate to protect blacks from a hostile Southern environment, it also sought to keep blacks in their place as laborers in order to allow production on the plantations to resume so that the South could revive its economy. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau cooperated with Southern authorities in rounding up black &quot;vagrants&quot; and placing them in contract work. In some places, it supported owners to maintain control of young slaves as apprentices.

New restrictions were placed on intermarriage, concubinage, and miscegenation with Black people in Arizona in 1864, California in 1880, Colorado in 1864, Florida, Indiana in 1905, Kentucky in 1866, Montana in 1909, Nebraska in 1865, Nevada in 1912, North Dakota in 1943, Ohio 1877, Oregon in 1867, Rhode Island in 1872, South Dakota in 1913, Tennessee in 1870, Texas in 1858, Utah in 1888, Virginia, Washington in 1866 but promptly repealed it in 1867, West Virginia in 1863 but overturned by Loving v Virginia in 1967, and Wyoming in 1908. In all, twenty-one states put in place Jim Crow laws against miscegenation. Free whites could no longer marry a slave and thereby emancipate her and her children, and no freedman could receive a donation or inheritance from a white person.

Soon after the end of slavery, white planters encountered a labor shortage and sought a way to manage it. Although blacks did not all abruptly stop working, they did try to work less. In particular, many sought to reduce their Saturday work hours, and women wanted to spend more time on child care. In the view of one contemporary economist, freed people exhibited this &quot;noncapitalist behavior&quot; because the condition of being owned had &quot;shielded the slaves from the market economy&quot; and they were therefore unable to perform &quot;careful calculation of economic opportunities&quot;.

An alternative explanation treats the labor slowdown as a form of gaining leverage through collective action. Another possibility is that freed blacks assigned value to leisure and family time in excess of the monetary value of additional paid labor. Indeed, freedpeople certainly did not &quot;want&quot; to work the long hours that had been forced upon them for their whole lives. Whatever its causes, the sudden reduction of available labor posed a challenge to the Southern economy, which had relied upon intense physical labor to profitably harvest cash crops, particularly cotton.

Southern Whites also perceived Black vagrancy as a sudden and dangerous social problem.

Preexisting White American belief of Black inferiority informed post-war attitudes and White racial dominance continued to be culturally embedded; Whites believed both that Black people were destined for servitude and that they would not work unless physically compelled. The enslaved strove to create a semi-autonomous social world, removed from the plantation and the gaze of the slave owner. The racial divisions that slavery had created immediately became more obvious. Blacks also bore the brunt of Southern anger over defeat in the War.

Legislation on the status of freedpeople was often mandated by constitutional conventions held in 1865. Mississippi, South Carolina, and Georgia all included language in their new state constitutions which instructed the legislature to &quot;guard them and the State against any evils that may arise from their sudden emancipation&quot;. The Florida convention of October 1865 included a vagrancy ordinance that was in effect until process Black Codes could be passed through the regular legislative process.
Black Codes restricted black people&#x27;s right to own property, conduct business, buy and lease land, and move freely through public spaces. A central element of the Black Codes were vagrancy laws. States criminalized men who were out of work, or who were not working at a job whites recognized. Failure to pay a certain tax, or to comply with other laws, could also be construed as vagrancy.

Nine Southern states updated their vagrancy laws in 1865–1866. Of these, eight allowed convict leasing (a system in which state prison hired out convicts for labor) and five allowed prisoner labor for public works projects. This created a system that established incentives to arrest black men, as convicts were supplied to local governments and planters as free workers. The planters or other supervisors were responsible for their board and food, and black convicts were kept in miserable conditions. As Douglas Blackmon wrote, it was &quot;slavery by another name&quot;. Because of their reliance on convict leasing, Southern states did not build any prisons until the late 19th century.

Another important part of the Codes were the annual labor contracts, which Black people had to keep and present to authorities to avoid vagrancy charges.

Strict punishments against theft also served to ensnare many people in the legal system. Previously, Blacks had been part of the domestic economy on a plantation, and were more or less able to use supplies that were available. After emancipation, the same act performed by someone working the same land might be labeled as theft, leading to arrest and involuntary labor.

Some states explicitly curtailed Black people&#x27;s right to bear arms, justifying these laws with claims of imminent insurrection. In Mississippi and Alabama, these laws were enforced through the creation of special militias.

Historian Samuel McCall, who published a biography of abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, commented in 1899 that the Black Codes had &quot;established a condition but little better than that of slavery, and in one important respect far worse&quot;: by severing the property relationship, they had diminished the incentive for property owners to ensure the relative health and survival of their workers.

Regarding the question of whether Southern legislatures deliberately tried to maintain white supremacy, Beverly Forehand writes: &quot;This decision was not a conscious one on the part of white legislators. It was simply an accepted conclusion.&quot;

During Reconstruction, state legislatures passed some laws that established some positive rights for freedmen. States legalized Black marriages and in some cases increased the rights of freedmen to own property and conduct commerce.

==Reconstruction and Jim Crow==

The Black Codes outraged public opinion in the North because it seemed the South was creating a form of quasi-slavery to negate the results of the war. When the Radical 39th Congress reconvened in December 1865, it was generally furious about the developments that had transpired during Johnson&#x27;s Presidential Reconstruction. The Black Codes, along with the appointment of prominent Confederates to Congress, signified that the South had been emboldened by Johnson and intended to maintain its old political order. Railing against the Black Codes as returns to slavery in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Bill.

The Memphis Riots in May 1866 and the New Orleans Riot in July brought additional attention and urgency to the racial tension state-sanctioned racism permeating the South.

After winning large majorities in the 1866 elections, the Republican Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts, placing the South under military rule. This arrangement lasted until the military withdrawal arranged by the Compromise of 1877. In some historical periodizations, 1877 marks the beginning of the Jim Crow era.

The 1865–1866 Black Codes were an overt manifestation of the system of white supremacy that continued to dominate the American South. Historians have described this system as the emergent result of a wide variety of laws and practices, conducted on all levels of jurisdiction. Because legal enforcement depended on so many different local codes, which underwent less scrutiny than statewide legislation, historians still lack a complete understanding of their full scope. It is clear, however, that even under military rule, local jurisdictions were able to continue a racist pattern of law enforcement, as long as it took place under a legal regime that was superficially race-neutral.

In 1893–1909, every Southern state passed new vagrancy laws. These laws were more severe than those passed in 1865, and used vague terms that granted wide powers to police officers enforcing the law. An example were the so-called &quot;Pig Laws&quot;, with harsh penalties for crimes such as stealing a farm animal. Pig Laws were solely applied to African Americans related to agricultural crimes. In wartime, Blacks might be disproportionately subjected to &quot;work or fight&quot; laws, which increased vagrancy penalties for those not in the military. The Supreme Court upheld racially discriminatory state laws and invalidated federal efforts to counteract them; in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), it upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation and introduced the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine.

A general system of legitimized anti-Black violence, as exemplified by the Ku Klux Klan, played a major part in enforcing the practical law of white supremacy. The constant threat of violence against Black people (and White people who sympathized with them) maintained a system of extralegal terror. Although this system is now well known for prohibiting Black suffrage after the Fifteenth Amendment, it also served to enforce coercive labor relations. Fear of random violence provided new support for a paternalistic relationship between plantation owners and their Black workers.

===Mississippi===
Mississippi was the first state to pass Black Codes. Its laws served as a model for those passed by other states, beginning with South Carolina, Alabama, and Louisiana in 1865, and continuing with Florida, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, and Arkansas at the beginning of 1866. Intense Northern reaction against the Mississippi and South Carolina laws led some of the states that subsequently passed laws to excise overt racial discrimination; but, their laws on vagrancy, apprenticeship, and other topics were crafted to effect a similarly racist regime. Even states that carefully eliminated most of the overt discrimination in their Black Codes retained laws authorizing harsher sentences for Black people.

Mississippi was the first state to legislate a new Black Code after the war, beginning with &quot;An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen&quot;. This law allowed Blacks to rent land only within cities—effectively preventing them from earning money through independent farming. It required Blacks to present, each January, written proof of employment. The law defined violation of this requirement as vagrancy, punishable by arrest—for which the arresting officer would be paid $5, to be taken from the arrestee&#x27;s wages. Provisions akin to fugitive slave laws mandated the return of runaway workers, who would lose their wages for the year. An amended version of the vagrancy law included punishments for sympathetic whites:

That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, without lawful employment or business, or found unlawfully assembling themselves together, either in the day or night time, and all white persons so assembling themselves with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes, on terms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication with a freed woman, free negro or mulatto, shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro, or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white man two hundred dollars, and imprisoned, at the discretion of the court, the free negro not exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months.

Whites could avoid the code&#x27;s penalty by swearing a pauper&#x27;s oath. In the case of blacks, however: &quot;the duty of the sheriff of the proper county to hire out said freedman, free negro or mulatto, to any person who will, for the shortest period of service, pay said fine or forfeiture and all costs.&quot; The laws also levied a special tax on blacks (between ages 18 and 60); those who did not pay could be arrested for vagrancy.

Another law allowed the state to take custody of children whose parents could or would not support them; these children would then be &quot;apprenticed&quot; to their former owners. Masters could discipline these apprentices with corporal punishment. They could re-capture apprentices who escaped and threaten them with prison if they resisted.

Other laws prevented blacks from buying liquor and carrying weapons; punishment often involved &quot;hiring out&quot; the culprit&#x27;s labor for no pay.

Mississippi rejected the Thirteenth Amendment on December 5, 1865.

General Oliver O. Howard, national head of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, declared in November 1865 that most of the Mississippi Black Code was invalid.

===South Carolina===
The next state to pass Black Codes was South Carolina, which had on November 13 ratified the Thirteenth Amendment—with a qualification that Congress did not have the authority to regulate the legal status of freedmen. Newly elected governor James Lawrence Orr said that blacks must be &quot;restrained from theft, idleness, vagrancy and crime, and taught the &quot;absolute necessity&quot; of strictly complying with their contracts for labor&quot;.

South Carolina&#x27;s new law on &quot;Domestic Relations of Persons of Color&quot; established wide-ranging rules on vagrancy resembling Mississippi&#x27;s. Conviction for vagrancy allowed the state to &quot;hire out&quot; blacks for no pay. The law also called for a special tax on blacks (all males and unmarried females), with non-paying blacks again guilty of vagrancy. The law enabled forcible apprenticeship of children of impoverished parents, or of parents who did not convey &quot;habits of industry and honesty&quot;. The law did not include the same punishments for Whites in dealing with fugitives.

The South Carolina law created separate courts for Black people, and authorized capital punishment for crimes including theft of cotton. It created a system of licensing and written authorizations that made it difficult for Blacks to engage in normal commerce.

The South Carolina Code clearly borrowed terms and concepts from the old slave codes, re-instituting a rating system of &quot;full&quot; or &quot;fractional&quot; farmhands and often referring to bosses as &quot;masters&quot;.

====Responses====
A &quot;Colored People&#x27;s Convention&quot; assembled at Zion Church in Charleston, South Carolina, to condemn the Codes. In a memorial (petition) to Congress, the Convention expressed gratitude for emancipation and establishment of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, but requested (in addition to suffrage) &quot;that the strong arm of law and order be placed alike over the entire people of this State; that life and property be secured, and the laborer as free to sell his labor as the merchant his goods.&quot;

Some people, meanwhile, thought the new laws did not go far enough. One planter suggested that the new laws would require paramilitary enforcement: &quot;As for making the negroes work under the present state of affairs it seems to me a waste of time and energy ... We must have mounted Infantry that the freedmen know distinctly that they succeed the Yankees to enforce whatever regulations we can make.&quot; Edmund Rhett (son of Robert Rhett) wrote that although South Carolina might be unable to undo abolition, 
it should to the utmost extent practicable be limited, controlled, and surrounded with such safe guards, as will make the change as slight as possible both to the white man and to the negro, the planter and the workman, the capitalist and the laborer.

General Daniel Sickles, head of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in South Carolina, followed Howard&#x27;s lead and declared the laws invalid in December 1865.

====Further legislation====
Even as the legislators passed these laws, they despaired of the forthcoming response from Washington. James Hemphill said: &quot;It will be hard to persuade the freedom shriekers that the American citizens of African descent are obtaining their rights.&quot; Orr moved to block further laws containing explicit racial discrimination. In 1866, the South Carolina code came under increasing scrutiny in the Northern press and was compared unfavorably to freedmen&#x27;s laws passed in neighboring Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.

In a special session held in September 1866, the legislature passed some new laws in concession to the rights of free Blacks. Shortly after, it rejected the Fourteenth Amendment.

===Louisiana===
The Louisiana legislature, seeking to ensure that freedmen were &quot;available to the agricultural interests of the state&quot;, passed similar yearly contract laws and expanded its vagrancy laws. Its vagrancy laws did not specify Black culprits, though they did provide a &quot;good behavior&quot; loophole subject to plausibly racist interpretation. Louisiana passed harsher fugitive worker laws and required blacks to present dismissal paperwork to new employers.

State legislation was amplified by local authorities, who ran less risk of backlash from the federal government. Opelousas, Louisiana, passed a notorious code which required freedpeople to have written authorization to enter the town. The code prevented freedpeople from living in the town or walking at night except under supervision of a White resident.

Thomas W. Conway, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau commissioner for Louisiana, testified in 1866:
Some of the leading officers of the state down there—men who do much to form and control the opinions of the masses—instead of doing as they promised, and quietly submitting to the authority of the government, engaged in issuing slave codes and in promulgating them to their subordinates, ordering them to carry them into execution, and this to the knowledge of state officials of a higher character, the governor and others. ... These codes were simply the old black code of the state, with the word &#x27;slave&#x27; expunged, and &#x27;Negro&#x27; substituted. The most odious features of slavery were preserved in them.

Conway describes surveying the Louisiana jails and finding large numbers of Black men who had been secretly incarcerated. These included members of the Seventy-Fourth Colored Infantry who had been arrested the day after they were discharged.

The state passed a harsher version of its code in 1866, criminalizing &quot;impudence&quot;, &quot;swearing&quot;, and other signs of &quot;disobedience&quot; as determined by whites.

===Florida===
Of the Black Codes passed in 1866 (after the Northern reaction had become apparent), only Florida&#x27;s rivaled those of Mississippi and South Carolina in severity. Florida&#x27;s slaveowners seemed to hold out hope that the institution of slavery would simply be restored. Advised by the Florida governor and attorney general as well as by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau that it could not constitutionally revoke Black people&#x27;s right to bear arms, the Florida legislature refused to repeal this part of the codes.

The Florida vagrancy law allowed for punishments of up to one year of labor. Children whose parents were convicted of vagrancy could be hired out as apprentices.

These laws applied to any &quot;person of color&quot;, which was defined as someone with at least one Negro great-grandparent, or one-eighth black ancestry. White women could not live with men of color. Colored workers could be punished for disrespecting White employers. The explicit racism in the law was supplemented by racist enforcement discretion (and other inequalities) in the practice of law enforcement and legal systems.

===Maryland===
In Maryland, a fierce battle began immediately after emancipation (by the Maryland Constitution of 1864) over requiring apprenticeship of young black people. By 1860, 45.6% of the black population in the state was already free. Former slave owners rushed to place the children of freedpeople in multi-year apprenticeships; the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and some others tried to stop them. The legislature stripped Baltimore Judge Hugh Lennox Bond of his position because he cooperated with the Bureau in this matter. Salmon Chase, as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, eventually overruled the Maryland apprentice laws on the grounds of their violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

===North Carolina===
North Carolina&#x27;s Black Code specified racial differences in punishment, establishing harsher sentences for Black people convicted of rape.

===Texas===
The Texas Constitutional Convention met in February 1866, declined to ratify the (already effective) Thirteenth Amendment, provided that Blacks would be &quot;protected in their rights of person and property by appropriate legislation&quot; and guaranteed some degree of rights to testify in court. Texas modeled its laws on South Carolina&#x27;s.

The legislature defined &quot;Negroes&quot; as people with at least one African great-grandparent. &quot;Negroes&quot; could choose their employer, before a deadline. After they had made a contract, they were bound to it. If they quit &quot;without cause of permission&quot; they would lose all of their wages. Workers could be fined $1 for acts of disobedience or negligence, and 25 cents per hour for missed work. The legislature also created a system of apprenticeship (with corporal punishment) and vagrancy laws. Convict labor could be hired out or used in public works.

&quot;Negroes&quot; were not allowed to vote, hold office, sit on juries, serve in local militia, carry guns on plantations, homestead, or attend public schools. Interracial marriage was banned. Rape sentencing laws stipulated either capital punishment, or life in prison, or a minimum sentence of five years. Even to commentators who favored the codes, this &quot;wide latitude in punishment&quot; seemed to imply a clear &quot;anti-Negro bias&quot;.

===Tennessee===
Tennessee had been occupied by the Union for a long period during the war. As military governor of Tennessee, Andrew Johnson declared a suspension of the slave code in September 1864. However, these laws were still enforced in lower courts. In 1865, Tennessee freedpeople had no legal status whatsoever, and local jurisdictions often filled the void with extremely harsh Black Codes. During that year, Blacks went from one-fiftieth to one-third of the State&#x27;s prison population.

Tennessee had a particularly urgent desire to re-enter the Union&#x27;s good graces and end the occupation. When the Tennessee Legislature began to debate a Black Code, it received such negative attention in the Northern press that no comprehensive Code was ever established. Instead, the State legalized Black suffrage and passed a civil rights law guaranteeing Blacks equal rights in commerce and access to the Courts.

However, Tennessee society, including its judicial system, retained the same racist attitudes as did other states. Although its legal code did not discriminate against Blacks so explicitly, its law enforcement and criminal justice systems relied more heavily on racist enforcement discretion to create a &quot;de facto&quot; Black Code. The state already had vagrancy and apprenticeship laws which could easily be enforced in the same way as Black Codes in other states. Vagrancy laws came into much more frequent use after the war. And just as in Mississippi, Black children were often bound in apprenticeship to their former owners.

The legislature passed two laws on May 17, 1865; one to &quot;Punish all Armed Prowlers, Guerilla, Brigands, and Highway Robbers&quot;; the other to authorize capital punishment for thefts, burglary, and arson. These laws were targeted at Blacks and enforced disproportionately against Blacks, but did not discuss race explicitly.

Tennessee law permitted Blacks to testify against Whites in 1865, but this change did not immediately take practical effect in the lower courts. Blacks could not sit on juries. Still on the books were laws specifying capital punishment for a Black man who raped a White woman.

Tennessee enacted new vagrancy and enticement laws in 1875.

===Kentucky===
Kentucky had established a system of leasing prison labor in 1825. This system drew a steady supply of laborers from the decisions of &quot;negro courts&quot;, informal tribunals which included slaveowners. Free Blacks were frequently arrested and forced into labor.

Kentucky did not secede from the Union and therefore gained wide leeway from the federal government during Reconstruction. With Delaware, Kentucky did not ratify the Thirteenth Amendment and maintained legal slavery until it was nationally prohibited when the Amendment went into effect in December 1865. After the Thirteenth Amendment took effect, the state was obligated to rewrite its laws.

The result was a set of Black Codes passed in early 1866. These granted a set of rights: to own property, make contracts, and some other innovations. They also included new vagrancy and apprentice laws, which did not mention Blacks explicitly but were clearly directed toward them. The vagrancy law covered loitering, &quot;rambling without a job&quot; and &quot;keeping a disorderly house&quot;. City jails filled up; wages dropped below pre-war rates.

The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in Kentucky was especially weak and could not mount a significant response. The Bureau attempted to cancel a racially discriminatory apprenticeship law (which stipulated that only White children learn to read) but found itself thwarted by local authorities.

Some legislation also created informal, &quot;de facto&quot; discrimination against Blacks. A new law against hunting on Sundays, for example, prevented Black workers from hunting on their only day off.

Kentucky law prevented Blacks from testifying against Whites, a restriction which the federal government sought to remedy by providing access to federal courts through the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Kentucky challenged the constitutionality of these courts and prevailed in &quot;Blyew v. United States&quot; (1872). All contracts required the presence of a White witness. Passage of the Fourteenth Amendment did not have a great effect on Kentucky&#x27;s Black Codes.

==Legacy and interventions==
This regime of white-dominated labor was not identified by the North as involuntary servitude until after 1900. In 1907, Attorney General Charles Joseph Bonaparte issued a report, &quot;Peonage Matters&quot;, which found that, beyond debt peonage, there was a widespread system of laws &quot;considered to have been passed to force negro laborers to work&quot;.

After creating the Civil Rights Section in 1939, the Federal Department of Justice launched a wave of successful Thirteenth Amendment prosecutions against involuntary servitude in the South.

Many of the Southern vagrancy laws remained in force until the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Papachristou v. Jacksonville&quot; decision in 1972. Although the laws were defended as preventing crime, the Court held that Jacksonville&#x27;s vagrancy law &quot;furnishes a convenient tool for &#x27;harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.&#x27;&quot;

Even after &quot;Papachristou&quot;, police activity in many parts of the United States discriminates against racial minority groups. Gary Stewart has identified contemporary gang injunctions—which target young Black or Latino men who gather in public—as a conspicuous legacy of Southern Black Codes. Stewart argues that these laws maintain a system of white supremacy and reflect a system of racist prejudice, even though racism is rarely acknowledged explicitly in their creation and enforcement. Contemporary Black commentators have argued that the current disproportionate incarceration of African Americans, with a concomitant rise in prison labor, is comparable (perhaps unfavorably) with the historical Black Codes.

==Comparative history==
The desire to recuperate the labor of officially emancipated people is common among societies (most notably in Latin America) that were built on slave labor. Vagrancy laws and peonage systems are widespread features of post-slavery societies. One theory suggests that particularly restrictive laws emerge in larger countries (compare Jamaica with the United States) where the ruling group does not occupy land at a high enough density to prevent the freed people from gaining their own. It seems that the United States was uniquely successful in maintaining involuntary servitude after legal emancipation.

Historians have also compared the end of the slavery in the United States to the formal decolonization of Asian and African nations. Like emancipation, decolonization was a landmark political change—but its significance, according to some historians, was tempered by the continuity of economic exploitation. The end of legal slavery in the United States did not seem to have major effects on the global economy or international relations. Given the pattern of economic continuity, writes economist Pieter Emmer, &quot;the words &quot;emancipation&quot; and &quot;abolition&quot; must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.&quot;

<doc id="1178140" wikidata="Q5149752" url="?curid=1178140" title="Columbia Law Review">
<text>The Columbia Law Review is a law review edited and published by students at Columbia Law School. The journal publishes scholarly articles, essays, and student notes.

It was established in 1901 by Joseph E. Corrigan and John M. Woolsey, who served as the review&#x27;s first editor-in-chief and secretary. The &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; is one of four law reviews that publishes the &quot;Bluebook&quot;.

== History ==
The &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; represents the school&#x27;s third attempt at a student-run law periodical. In 1885, the &quot;Columbia Jurist&quot; was founded by a group of six students but ceased publication in 1887. Despite its short run, the &quot;Jurist&quot; is credited with partially inspiring the creation of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, which began publication a short time later.

The second journal, the &quot;Columbia Law Times&quot; was founded in 1887 and closed down in 1893 due to lack of revenue.

Publication of the current &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; began in 1901, making it the fifth oldest surviving law review in the US. Dean William Keener took an active involvement during its founding to help ensure its longevity.

===Nakba article===
In June 2024, the journal published an article by Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian human rights lawyer, titled &quot;Toward Nakba as a Legal Concept&quot;, which criticizes the &quot;brutally sophisticated regime of oppression&quot; of Palestinians &quot;[a]cross Israel, the West Bank, 
the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and refugee camps&quot; by the Israeli government. The article aims at creating an international legal framework for the Nakba similar to genocide and apartheid. The article also refers to the Arabic term &quot;al-Nakba,&quot; which &quot;is often used ... to refer to the ruinous establishment of Israel in Palestine.&quot; 

The same day that the article was published, the &quot;Review&#x27;s&quot; board of directors shut down the &quot;Review&#x27;s&quot; website and replaced it with a message stating that the site was &quot;under maintenance&quot;. Later that day, the &quot;Review&#x27;s&quot; student editors published the article on a publicly accessible web site, as a free PDF file. Two days after the website was shut down, the editors voted to go on strike. The next day, the board of directors restored the &quot;Review&#x27;s&quot; website, including Eghbariah&#x27;s article, but added a statement explaining that the website was shut-down due to the &quot;secretive&quot; nature of the editorial process. The editorial board disagreed with that assertion and stated that the editorial process was comparable to that used for all other articles.

== Impact ==
Among United States law journals as of 202&quot;4, Columbia Law Review&quot; is ranked #2 by Washington and Lee University Law School and as of 2023, #4 by a professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication.

The &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; was the top-cited law journal during the 2018 Supreme Court term.

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; had a 2009 impact factor of 3.610, ranking it third out of 116 journals in the category &quot;Law&quot;. In 2007, the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; ranked second for submissions and citations within the legal academic community, after &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;.

<doc id="1178141" wikidata="Q651120" url="?curid=1178141" title="Frederator Studios">
<text>Frederator Studios is an American animation television production studio founded by Fred Seibert in January 1997. It is a division of Frederator Networks, Inc., itself a part of Kartoon Studios&#x27; Canadian holding company Wow Unlimited Media. The studio&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Original Cartoons since 1998.&quot;

Frederator and Seibert have been credited with producing various, critically-acclaimed media projects, predominantly in animation suitable for general audiences. The studio has locations in New York City, where Frederator Digital is based, and Burbank, California.

In 2016, Frederator would be acquired by Canadian animation studio Rainmaker, and merged into Wow! Unlimited Media where Seibert was Chief Creator Officer; he would remain at the company until August 2020. After departing, he would found a successor company, FredFilms, in February 2021.

== History ==
===Founding and early years===
Before Frederator, in 1983, Fred Seibert founded Fred/Alan, Inc. in New York City with his college friend Alan Goodman; in 1988, Fred/Alan partnered with Albie Hecht in Chauncey Street Productions to produce television programs for Nickelodeon, MTV, A&amp;E, and CBS. The Fred/Alan firm closed down in 1992.

Seibert became the president of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons in 1992, and created &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, a showcase consisting of 48 shorts that aired on Cartoon Network. In 1996, when Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting (owner of Hanna-Barbera), he left the studio.

Frederator Incorporated was formed on January 6, 1997 (its first cartoons were released in 1998), and was housed at a temporary location of the Nickelodeon Animation Studio in North Hollywood, California. Frederator&#x27;s debut production was the cartoon short incubator, a television series called &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;, which later spun off three series: &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; (its first official series), as well &quot;ChalkZone&quot;, and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, in addition to 51 original short cartoons from creators including Butch Hartman, Rob Renzetti, Tim Biskup, Larry Huber, Pat Ventura, Seth MacFarlane, and Carlos Ramos. &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; was based on Seibert&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; series of shorts from Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and Cartoon Network, which brought Hanna-Barbera its first hit series in 10 years, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;. Frederator has produced a total of 16 television series, and over 200 miniseries, including webisodes. , the company was in a producing partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and YouTube. 

In 2002, Frederator created a joint venture for preschoolers named Bolder Media with producer Susan Miller&#x27;s Mixed Media Group, Inc.. They produced their first preschool series created by Bob Boyle for Nick Jr., &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot;.

Frederator Studios created a television series and competition &quot;The Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; (now known as the &quot;Nicktoons Network Animation Festival&quot;) for the Nicktoons Network, which debuted October 24, 2004.

In 2004, David Karp interned at Frederator Studios at its first Manhattan location, and built their first blogging platform. In 2007, he launched Tumblr from a rented desk at Frederator Studios&#x27; Park Avenue South offices, with chief engineer Marco Arment. Seibert was one of Tumblr&#x27;s first bloggers.

On November 1, 2005, Frederator launched what it called &quot;the first cartoon podcast.&quot; Named Channel Frederator by David Karp (who also structured and edited the initial episodes), this weekly animation network features submitted films from around the world, and quickly became one of the top video podcasts on Apple Inc.&#x27;s iTunes. In quick succession, The Wubbcast was launched for pre-schoolers in January 2006, and &quot;ReFrederator&quot; featuring vintage public domain cartoons in April 2006. Channel Frederator became the model for Seibert&#x27;s media company Next New Networks and reaches almost 4,000,000 video views monthly.

On June 25, 2007 &quot;Variety&quot; article announced the studio had formed Frederator Films, dedicated to creating animated feature films budgeted under $20 million. Frederator&#x27;s first feature is set up at Paramount Pictures, co-produced with J. J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot. They have also set up their first two animated features in a first look production arrangement for Sony Pictures Animation.

===Expansion into web animation===
The studio produced its first original internet cartoons with independent animator Dan Meth. &quot;The Meth Minute 39&quot; launched on September 5, 2007, featuring 39 of Meth&#x27;s original character shorts. (The first cartoon was &quot;Internet People&quot;, a video on the viral video sites YouTube and MySpaceTV that featured some popular Internet memes and internet people.) A spin-off, &quot;Nite Fite&quot;, debuted in October 2008. These series have totaled over 35,000,000 video views to date.

&quot;Random! Cartoons&quot;, the latest Frederator anthology series, began airing on Nicktoons in 2009; it spawned two TV series, &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot; and &quot;Adventure Time&quot; (the first Frederator production not for Nickelodeon and the first and only series made for Cartoon Network), as well as the web series, &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;.

Frederator Studios became a division of parent Frederator Networks when founder Fred Seibert announced the company&#x27;s new YouTube funded channel and adult production label, Cartoon Hangover in February 2012 and 18 months later started the Channel Frederator Network, a multi-channel network(MCN) dedicated to helping individual YouTube animation creators distribute and monetize their owned and operated channels. At launch, Frederator produced three animated series for Cartoon Hangover: &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, created by Pendleton Ward; &quot;SuperFuckers&quot;, created by James Kochalka; and &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot;, an incubator featuring content from different animators. &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot; premiered on November 8, 2012 and &quot;SuperFuckers&quot; premiered on November 30, 2012.

In July 2013 as part of &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot; Cartoon Hangover premiered the first part of the 10-minute short film, &quot;Bee and PuppyCat&quot; created by Natasha Allegri. Due to its popularity, in November 2013 Frederator launched a Kickstarter to fund a first season of the series, which was successful and raised $872,133 toward more episodes of the show. The project was the most funded animation and web series Kickstarter at the conclusion, and the fourth most-funded Film/Video project.

In 2013, Frederator launched a digital-only ebook company, Frederator Books. Frederator Books published its first title, &quot;The Lieography of Babe Ruth&quot; in March 2013.

In 2014, Frederator announced the launch of The Channel Frederator Network, a Multi Channel Network (MCN) of independently owned animation channels on YouTube. Since its start, Channel Frederator Network has generated more than one billion views, and averages more than 30 million views a month, across its network of more than 200 channels. Some of its leading channels are FilmCow (just over 1 million subscribers), Cartoon Hangover (over 1 million subscribers), and &quot;Simon&#x27;s Cat&quot; (over 2,800,000 subscribers), which is YouTube&#x27;s #2 animated channel. Once part of the network, Frederator handles all advertising and distribution for its channels on YouTube, promoting the show and its licensed merchandise.

As of 2016, Mexican animation studio Ánima Estudios and Frederator Studios have launched a new YouTube network, called Átomo Network, focusing on Spanish-language content.

===Acquisition by Rainmaker; Wow Unlimited merger, and Kartoon Studios ownership===
In December 2016, Canadian studio Rainmaker Entertainment (now, and originally known as, Mainframe) acquired Frederator Networks. Together with Ezrin Hirsh Entertainment (EHE), the three would be merged into the holding company Wow Unlimited Media, Inc.. 

In August 2020, it was announced Fred Seibert would resign as CEO of Frederator Studios. Michael Hirsh, co-founder of Canadian studio Nelvana, would take over.

On October 27, 2021, Genius Brands (now Kartoon Studios) announced that it had agreed to acquire Wow Unlimited Media for C$66 million (US$53 million), with the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition was completed on April 7, 2022.

In January 2023, 50% of the rights to &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot; and &quot;Bee and Puppycat&quot; was sold to Japanese studio Toho International.

<doc id="1178150" wikidata="Q461408" url="?curid=1178150" title="Tsutomu Miyazaki">
<text>was a Japanese serial killer who murdered four young girls in Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture between August 1988 and June 1989. He abducted and killed the girls, aged from 4 to 7, in his car before dismembering them and molesting their corpses. He also engaged in cannibalism, preserved body parts as trophies, and taunted the families of his victims.

Miyazaki was arrested in Hachiōji in July 1989 after being confronted while taking nude photographs of a young girl. He was diagnosed as having one or more personality disorders, but was determined by authorities to be sane and aware of his crimes and their consequences. Miyazaki was sentenced to death in 1997 and was executed by hanging in 2008.

Miyazaki was dubbed the &quot;Otaku Murderer&quot; due to his extensive collection of anime, manga, horror videotapes and hentai as well as various other forms of pornography. This triggered a widespread moral panic against &quot;otaku&quot; in Japan, similar to the Satanic Panic in America.

==Early life==
Tsutomu Miyazaki was born on 21 August 1962 in Itsukaichi, Tokyo, the son of a wealthy family. He was born premature and had the rare birth defect radioulnar synostosis that caused his hand joints to be fused together, preventing him from being able to bend his wrists upwards. Miyazaki&#x27;s family operated a regional newspaper company and were well known in Itsukaichi, where his grandfather and great-grandfather had served on the town council. Due to his parents being busy, he was mainly raised by his grandfather and an intellectually disabled man the family hired as a nanny.

Miyazaki was ostracized when he attended elementary school due to his deformity, and consequently kept to himself. He attended Meidai Nakano High School in Nakano, a prestigious high school associated with Meiji University, and was a star student until his grades began to drop dramatically. He was ranked 40 out of 56 in his class and did not receive the customary admission to Meiji University for students of the school. Instead of studying English and becoming a teacher as he originally intended, Miyazaki attended a local junior college and studied to become a photography technician.

In the mid-1980s, Miyazaki moved back into his parents&#x27; house in Itsukaichi, sharing a room with his elder sister. Although his family was highly influential in Itsukaichi, he expressed no desire to take over their business. After his arrest, Miyazaki would say that what he really craved was &quot;being listened to about his problems&quot; but believed that his parents, more worried about the material than the sentimental, &quot;would have not heard [him]; [he] would&#x27;ve been ignored&quot;. In the same confession, he said that by this period in his life he had begun to consider suicide. Miyazaki felt he only received support from his grandfather, to whom he was close, and was rejected by his two younger sisters.

In May 1988, Miyazaki&#x27;s grandfather died, which served to deepen his depression and isolate him even further. In an attempt to &quot;retain something from him&quot;, Miyazaki ate part of his grandfather&#x27;s ashes. A few weeks later, one of Miyazaki&#x27;s sisters caught him watching her while she was taking a shower; he attacked her when she told him to leave. When his mother learned of the incident and demanded that he spend more time working and less time with his videotapes, he attacked her as well.

==Murders==
Between August 1988 and June 1989, Miyazaki mutilated and murdered four girls between the ages of 4 and 7, and sexually molested their corpses. He drank the blood of one victim and ate a part of her hand. These crimes—which prior to Miyazaki&#x27;s apprehension were named the &quot;Little Girl Murders&quot; and later the —shocked Saitama Prefecture, which had few crimes against children.

On 22 August 1988, one day after Miyazaki&#x27;s 26th birthday, Mari Konno, aged 4, vanished while playing at a friend&#x27;s house. Miyazaki had led Konno into his black Nissan Langley, then drove westward of Tokyo and parked the car under a bridge in a wooded area. There, he sat alongside Konno for half an hour before murdering her and molesting her corpse. He dumped her body in the hills near his home, departing with her clothes, then allowed the body to decompose before returning to remove her hands and feet, which he kept in his closet. Miyazaki burned Konno&#x27;s remaining bones in his furnace, ground them into powder, and sent them to her family in a box along with several of her teeth, photos of her clothes, and a postcard which read, (&quot;Mari. Bones. Cremated. Investigate. Prove.&quot;) Konno&#x27;s hands and feet were found in Miyazaki&#x27;s closet after his arrest almost a year later.

On 3 October 1988, Miyazaki abducted Masami Yoshizawa, aged 7, after spotting her while driving along a rural road. He had offered Yoshizawa a ride, which she accepted, then drove her to the same place he had killed Konno. Miyazaki killed Yoshizawa, engaged in sexual acts with her corpse, and took her clothes with him when he departed. Two months later, on 12 December 1988, he abducted Erika Namba, aged 4, as she was returning home from a friend&#x27;s house. Miyazaki forced her into his car and drove to a parking lot in Naguri, where he forced her to remove her clothes in the back seat and began to take pictures of her. He killed Namba, tied her hands and feet behind her back, covered her with a bedsheet, and placed her body in his car&#x27;s trunk. He disposed of her clothes in a wooded area and left her body in the adjoining parking lot, where it was discovered three days later. On 20 December, Namba&#x27;s family received a postcard sent by Miyazaki with a message assembled using words cut out of magazines: (&quot;Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death.&quot;)

On 6 June 1989, Miyazaki convinced Ayako Nomoto, aged 5, to allow him to take pictures of her. He then led Nomoto into his car and murdered her, covered her corpse with a bedsheet and placed her in his trunk. Miyazaki took the corpse into his apartment and spent the next two days engaging in sexual acts with her body, taking photos and videos of the remains in various positions. When Nomoto&#x27;s corpse began to decompose, Miyazaki dismembered it, abandoning her torso in a cemetery and her head in the nearby hills. He kept her hands, drinking blood from and cannibalizing them. Fearing that the police would find Nomoto&#x27;s body parts, Miyazaki returned to the cemetery and the hills two weeks later and carried the remains back to his apartment, where he hid them in his closet.

==Arrest==
On 23 July 1989, Miyazaki saw two sisters playing in a park in Hachiōji and managed to separate the younger of the sisters from the older one, who stayed behind. He was taking photographs of the younger daughter, whom he had convinced to strip nude, when he was caught by their father, who attacked Miyazaki but was unable to restrain him. After fleeing on foot, Miyazaki eventually returned to the park to retrieve his car, whereupon he was arrested by police responding to a call by the father. A search of his two-room bungalow produced 5,763 videotapes, some containing anime and slasher films (later used as reasoning for his crimes). Interspersed among them was video footage and photos of his victims. Miyazaki, who retained a perpetually calm and collected demeanor during his trial, appeared indifferent to his capture.

==Moral panic==
Japanese media dubbed Miyazaki the &quot;Otaku Murderer&quot;, in reference to &quot;otaku&quot; culture. His killings caused a moral panic against &quot;otaku&quot;, with speculation that anime and horror films had made him a murderer. Various newspapers claimed that Miyazaki had retreated into a fantasy world of manga as a result of his neglected upbringing.
Keigo Okonogi, a psychoanalyst at Tokyo International University, told the &quot;Shūkan Post&quot; that:

These reports were disputed. In Eiji Ōtsuka&#x27;s book on Miyazaki&#x27;s crimes, he argued that Miyazaki&#x27;s collection of pornography was probably added or amended by a photographer in order to highlight his perversity. Another critic, Fumiya Ichihashi, suspected the released information played up to public stereotypes and fears about &quot;otaku&quot;, as the police knew they would help cement a conviction. Sharon Kinsella asserts that large collections of manga and videos were typical in the rooms of youths living in the Tokyo area at the time.

==Trial and execution==
Miyazaki&#x27;s trial began on 30 March 1990. Often talking nonsensically, he blamed his actions on &quot;Rat Man&quot;, an alter ego who he claimed forced him to kill; he spent time during the trial drawing &quot;Rat Man&quot; in cartoon form. 

The seven-year trial focused on Miyazaki&#x27;s mental state at the time of the murders. Under Japanese law, people of unsound minds are not subject to punishment, and people having cognitive disability are entitled to reduced sentences. Three teams of court-appointed expert psychiatrists came to differing conclusions about Miyazaki&#x27;s ability to tell right from wrong: one team determined Miyazaki to have a cognitive disability, another team thought him either schizophrenic or as having dissociative personality disorder (also known as &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot;), and the third team found that although Miyazaki definitely had at least one personality disorder, he was still capable of taking responsibility for his actions.

The Tokyo District Court judged Miyazaki aware of the magnitude and consequences of his crimes and therefore accountable. He was sentenced to death on April 14, 1997. His death sentence was upheld by both the Tokyo High Court, on June 28, 2001, and the Supreme Court of Justice on January 17, 2006.

Miyazaki described his serial murders as an &quot;act of benevolence&quot;. Child killer Kaoru Kobayashi described himself as &quot;the next Tsutomu Miyazaki or Mamoru Takuma&quot;, to which Miyazaki stated, &quot;I won&#x27;t allow him to call himself &#x27;the second Tsutomu Miyazaki&#x27; when he hasn&#x27;t even undergone a psychiatric examination.&quot;

Minister of Justice Kunio Hatoyama signed Miyazaki&#x27;s death warrant on June 17, 2008, and he was hanged at the Tokyo Detention House that same day. Writer Ryūzō Saki observed that Miyazaki&#x27;s trial was long and noted that in the end Miyazaki was &quot;not willing to criticize [Minister of Justice] Hatoyama&quot;.

<text>Charles Ellsworth Goodell Jr. (March 16, 1926January 21, 1987) was an American politician who represented New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1968 and the United States Senate from 1968 to 1971. In both cases, he took office following the deaths of his predecessors, first in a special election and second as a temporary appointee succeeding Robert F. Kennedy.

He was elected to four full terms in Congress after winning his first race in 1959. He resigned on September 9, 1968 to accept an appointment by governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vacancy caused by the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. Having earned the support of both the Republican and Liberal parties in 1970, he lost in a three-way race to Conservative Party candidate James L. Buckley, having split the liberal vote with Democratic Party candidate Richard Ottinger.

Goodell was the father of National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Roger Goodell.

==Early life and education==
Goodell was born in Jamestown, New York, the son of Francesca (née Bartlett) and Charles Ellsworth Goodell. He attended the public schools of Jamestown and graduated from Williams College as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1948. He served in the United States Navy during the World War II era as a seaman second class (1944–1946) and in the United States Air Force as a first lieutenant (1952–1953) during the Korean War.

Goodell received an LL.B. from Yale Law School in 1951 and an M.A. in government from Yale in 1952. He briefly taught at Quinnipiac College in 1952. Following his admission to the Connecticut bar (1951) and the New York bar (1954), he began his law practice in Jamestown. He was a great-grandson of William Goodell, an abolitionist.

==Congressional career==
Goodell was a congressional liaison assistant for the Department of Justice in 1954–1955. He won a special election on May 26, 1959 as a Republican to the 86th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Daniel A. Reed. In District 43, Goodell received 27,454 votes (65%), with Democrat Robert E. McCaffery receiving 14,250 votes (33.8%).

Goodell was reelected in November 1960 to the 87th Congress and reelected three times thereafter. During his tenure in the House, Goodell voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted against the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Goodell opposed the 24th Amendment reluctantly, arguing on the floor before the vote that the amendment was deficient because it was limited to banning poll taxes for federal elections. He resigned on September 9, 1968 to accept governor Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s appointment to the United States Senate, filling the vacancy caused by the assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 6, 1968. Because a special election to fill the vacancy would not be held for more than two years, public objection to the length of Goodell&#x27;s appointment led to a failed legal challenge to the governor&#x27;s power to appoint senators in the event of a vacancy, &quot;Valenti v. Rockefeller&quot;.

Although he had been a moderate to conservative member in the House, as a senator Goodell was nearly as liberal as New York&#x27;s other Republican senator, Jacob Javits. In the Senate, Goodell authored and sponsored a large number of bills, including several to provide conservation and development aid to small towns and rural areas. Many small upstate New York communities without municipal sewage systems built them with the aid of federal matching funds provided by Goodell&#x27;s legislation. Along with Oregon senator Mark Hatfield, Goodell was among the loudest anti-Vietnam War Republican voices. Antiwar protesters and activists praised his advocacy of a withdrawal from Vietnam.

In 1970, the New York Republican Party was split deeply over the issue of the Second New Right conservatism of much of the grassroots support for the party versus the perceived liberalism of the party organization, leadership and Governor Rockefeller himself. While Rockefeller&#x27;s supporters were strong enough within the party and its regular organization to assure that Goodell would receive the party&#x27;s nomination for his first full term, many conservative activists left the party to support candidates farther to the right. Vice President Spiro Agnew called Goodell the &quot;Christine Jorgensen of the Republican Party,&quot; comparing his ideological shift to Jorgensen&#x27;s highly publicized sex-change operation. Goodell ran under the slogan &quot;Senator Goodell—He&#x27;s too good to lose&quot; and received the nomination of the Liberal Party as well as that of the regular Republican organization, an electoral fusion allowed under New York law.

A television ad aired by Goodell&#x27;s 1970 campaign compared him to opponents Richard Ottinger and James L. Buckley as &quot;the lightweight, the heavyweight and the dead weight.&quot; In the November 1970 election, despite Rockefeller&#x27;s support and that of the Republican and Liberal parties, Goodell split the liberal vote with Ottinger and was defeated by Conservative Party candidate Buckley. Goodell finished third with 24.3% of the vote.

Goodell would be the last appointed senator from New York until 2009, when Kirsten Gillibrand was selected to replace Hillary Clinton, who had been appointed Secretary of State.

==After Congress==
After leaving Congress, Goodell resumed practicing law. In the mid-1970s, he served as vice chairman, with former Pennsylvania governor William Scranton as chairman, of President Gerald Ford&#x27;s committee to draft rules for granting amnesty to Vietnam War-era draft evaders and deserters.

==Personal life==

Goodell married Jean Rice (1930–1984), a former registered nurse, in 1954. They had five children: Bill, a hedge fund executive; Tim, a senior vice president for the Hess Corporation; Roger, the commissioner of the NFL; Michael, a Pilates instructor and Jeff, the former head of the Upper School of Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall in San Antonio. Rice briefly ran for Congress in in 1976. They were divorced in 1978. Goodell married Patricia Goldman (1942–2023), a congressional caucus director who later sat on the National Transportation Safety Board, in 1978.

Goodell was a resident of Washington, D.C. and Bronxville, New York, until his death of complications following a heart attack on January 21, 1987. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown.

<text>Sadie T. Benning (born April 11, 1973) is an American artist, who has worked primarily in video, painting, drawing, sculpture, photography and sound. Benning creates experimental films and explores a variety of themes including surveillance, gender, ambiguity, transgression, play, intimacy, and identity. They became a known artist as a teenager, with their short films made with a PixelVision camera that have been described as &quot;video diaries&quot;.

Benning was a co-founder and a former member of the American electronic rock band Le Tigre, from 1998 until 2001.

==Early life==
Sadie Benning was born April 11, 1973, in Madison, Wisconsin. Benning was raised by their mother in inner-city Milwaukee. Their parents divorced before they were born, their father is film director James Benning. Benning left high school at age 16 due to homophobia.

They have identified as non-binary.

== Work ==

=== Early work ===
Benning began creating visual works at age 15, they started filming with the &quot;toy&quot; video camera they received as a Christmas gift from their father, the experimental filmmaker James Benning. Benning used a Fisher-Price PXL-2000 camera, also known as PixelVision, which created pixelated black and white video on standard audio cassette tapes. At first, Benning was standoffish to the PixelVision camera and is quoted as saying, &quot;I thought, &#x27;This is a piece of shit. It&#x27;s black-and-white. It&#x27;s for kids. He&#x27;d told me I was getting this surprise. I was expecting a camcorder.&quot;

They made four short films and brought them to their father&#x27;s film class he was teaching at Cal Arts, and they screened the films for the first time in front of a class. One of the students put one of the films in a film festival he was organizing. By the age of 19, they had shown their films at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Sundance Institute, and at international film festivals.

===Themes===
The majority of Benning&#x27;s shorts combined performance, experimental narrative, handwriting, and cut-up music to explore, among other subjects, gender and sexuality. Benning&#x27;s work has been included in the Whitney Biennial on four occasions (1993, 2000, 2006), and they were the youngest artist included in the well-known and controversial 1993 Whitney Biennial.

Benning&#x27;s earlier videos – &quot;A New Year&quot;, &quot;Living Inside&quot;, &quot;Me and Rubyfruit&quot;, &quot;Jollies&quot;, and &quot;If Every Girl Had a Diary &quot;- used Benning&#x27;s isolated surroundings and the effect this had on Benning as a focus for their theme. In Benning&#x27;s earliest work, &quot;A New Year&quot;, Benning shied away from being in front of the camera, instead focusing on their surroundings – primarily the confines of their room and bedroom window – to portray their feelings of angst, confusion and alienation. &quot;I don&#x27;t talk, I&#x27;m not physically in it, it&#x27;s all handwritten text, music; I wanted to substitute objects, things that were around me, to illustrate the events. I used objects in the closest proximity – the television, toys, my dog, whatever.&quot;

The themes of sexual identity and the challenges of growing up are repeated throughout the body of Benning&#x27;s work, who self-identified as a lesbian in 2014. Benning&#x27;s video &quot;Me and Rubyfruit&quot; is referred to as their &quot;first video to be presented as a coming-out narrative&quot;. Benning uses pop culture, such as music, television or newspapers, to amplify their message while simultaneously parodying the same pop culture. Benning also draws inspiration from images on television or in movies, observing: &quot;They&#x27;re totally fake and constructed to entertain and oppress at the same time – they&#x27;re meaningless to women, and not just to gay women. I got started partly because I needed different images and I never wanted to wait for someone to do it for me&quot;. The use of a variety of media in their work gives insight to the viewer on how Benning has been mostly interacting with the world.

As their work has progressed, Benning has increasingly used images of their own body and voice. In works such as &quot;If Every Girl Had a Diary&quot;, Benning uses the limitations of the PixelVision to get extreme closeups of their own face, eyes, fingers, and other extremities so that the focus is on sections of their face as they narrate their life and thoughts. In 1998, the English Professor Mia Carter observed: &quot;Benning&#x27;s daring autoerotic and autobiographic videos, [their] ability to make the camera seem a part of [their] self, and extension of [their] body, invite the audience to know [them].&quot;

=== Later work ===
Benning entered Bard College in 2013 and graduated two years later with a MFA degree, where they now work as faculty.

Their work is in various public museum collections including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Whitney Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Albright-Knox Art Gallery, among others.

==Music==
In 1998, Benning co-founded Le Tigre, the feminist post-punk band whose members include ex-Bikini Kill singer/guitarist Kathleen Hanna and zinester Johanna Fateman. Benning left the band in 2001 and JD Samson joined Le Tigre after Benning&#x27;s departure.

==Awards, recognition, and honors==
In 1991, the first article about Benning&#x27;s work, written by Ellen Spiro, appeared in the national gay magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;. In 2004, Bill Horrigan curated a retrospective of Benning&#x27;s works on video. In 2009, Chloe Hope Johnson contributed a chapter in the book &quot;There She Goes: Feminist Filmmaking and Beyond (Contemporary Approaches to Film and Media Series)&quot; entitled Becoming-Grrrl &quot;The Voice and Videos of Sadie Benning.&quot;

Benning has received grants and fellowships from Guggenheim Fellowship (2005) by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation grant (1992), Andrea Frank Foundation, and National Endowment of the Arts (NEA). Awards include the Wexner Center Residency Award in Media Arts (2003–2004, which was extended to 2006), National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture Merit Award, Grande video Kunst Award, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Circle Award.

Their videos are distributed by Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

<text>William Beaumont (November 21, 1785 – April 25, 1853) was a surgeon in the U.S. Army who became known as the &quot;Father of Gastric Physiology&quot; for his research on human digestion on Alexis St. Martin.

== Early life ==

William Beaumont was born to Samuel Beaumont and Lucretia Abel in Lebanon, Connecticut; his father was a farmer. He left his home after he turned twenty-one, moved to Champlain, New York and obtained a teaching job. In 1810 he relocated to St. Albans, Vermont, where he trained to become a physician through an apprenticeship with Dr. Truman Powell. In June 1812, the Third Medical Society of the State of Vermont in Burlington examined his knowledge &quot;on the anatomy of the human body, and the theory and practice of physic and surgery&quot; and recommended him as &quot;judicious and safe practitioner in the different avocations of the medical profession.&quot;

From 1812 until 1815, Beaumont served as an assistant surgeon in the Army during the War of 1812, participating in the Battle of Plattsburgh. After the war ended, he started a private practice in Plattsburgh, New York, but by 1820, Beaumont had rejoined the Army as a surgeon. He was assigned a location at Fort Mackinac. Beaumont took a leave in 1821 and married Deborah &quot;Debby&quot; Green Platt in Plattsburgh before returning to his post. Deborah was divorced from Nathaniel Platt, whose uncle Zephaniah Platt founded Plattsburgh after the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Her father, Israel Green, was a third cousin of General Nathanael Greene.

== Experiments with St. Martin ==

On June 6, 1822, an employee of the American Fur Company on Mackinac Island named Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach at close range by the discharge of a shotgun loaded with buckshot that injured his ribs and his stomach. Beaumont treated his wound, but expected St. Martin to die from his injuries. Despite this dire prediction, St. Martin survived – but with a hole, or fistula, in his stomach that never fully healed. Unable to continue work for the American Fur Company, he was hired as a servant by Beaumont.

By August 1825, Beaumont had been relocated to Fort Niagara in New York, and St. Martin went with him. Beaumont recognized that he had in St. Martin an unusual opportunity to observe digestive processes. Beaumont began to perform experiments on digestion using St. Martin&#x27;s stomach. Most of the experiments were conducted by tying a piece of food to a string and inserting it through the hole into the stomach. Every few hours, Beaumont would remove the food and observe how well it had been digested. Beaumont also extracted a sample of gastric acid from St. Martin&#x27;s stomach for analysis. In September, St. Martin ran away from Beaumont and moved to Canada, leaving Beaumont to concentrate on his duties as an army surgeon, but Beaumont had St. Martin caught so Beaumont could continue to exhibit him.

Beaumont also used samples of stomach acid taken out of St. Martin to &quot;digest&quot; bits of food in cups. This led to the important discovery that the stomach acid, and not solely the mashing, pounding, and squeezing of the stomach, digests the food into nutrients the stomach can use; in other words, digestion was primarily a chemical process and not a mechanical one.

During 1826 and 1827, Beaumont was stationed at Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1828 he was transferred to St. Louis, Missouri. While en route, St. Martin was ordered to stop at Fort Crawford in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to serve as Beaumont&#x27;s servant again. In early 1831, Beaumont conducted another set of experiments on St. Martin&#x27;s stomach, ranging from the simple observation of normal digestion to the effects that temperature, exercise, and even emotions have on the digestive process.

Beaumont published the account of his experiments in 1838 as &quot;Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice, and the Physiology of Digestion&quot;. He and St. Martin parted ways, with Beaumont eventually returning to St. Louis and St. Martin to his home in Quebec province, Canada. On and off for the next twenty years, Beaumont tried to get St. Martin to move to St. Louis, but the move never occurred.

== Death ==
Beaumont died in 1853 at the age of 67 in St. Louis, Missouri, as a result of slipping on ice-covered steps. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

His papers are held at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine Library, and copies are held at the National Library of Medicine.

*The story of Beaumont&#x27;s treatment of and experiments on St. Martin was reenacted on the medical drama &quot;Medic&quot;, which aired on February 27, 1956.
*A play centered around Beaumont&#x27;s relationship with St. Martin was published by playwright Alexander Attea in 2022 and experienced a reading at the International Museum of Surgical Science in Chicago, Illinois in the same year.

<text>The Deutsches Wörterbuch (; &quot;The German Dictionary&quot;), abbreviated DWB, is the largest and most comprehensive dictionary of the German language in existence. Encompassing modern High German vocabulary in use since 1450, it also includes loanwords adopted from other languages into German. Entries cover the etymology, meanings, attested forms, synonyms, usage peculiarities, and regional differences of words found throughout the German speaking world. The dictionary&#x27;s historical linguistics approach, illuminated by examples from primary source documents, makes it to German what the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is to English. The first completed DWB lists over 330,000 headwords in 67,000 print columns spanning 32 volumes.

The &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot; was begun by the Brothers Grimm in 1838 and the initial volumes were published in 1854. Unfinished at the time of their deaths, the dictionary was finally completed by a succession of later scholars and institutions in 1961. In 1971, a 33rd supplement volume was published containing 25,000 additional entries. New research projects began in 2004 to expand and update the oldest parts of the dictionary to modern academic standards. Volumes A–F were planned for completion in 2012 by the Language Research Centre at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the University of Göttingen.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Beginning in 1830, Weidmann&#x27;s Publishing House in Leipzig repeatedly approached Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm with a proposal for a large new dictionary, spanning German vocabulary from Martin Luther to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. As busy professors at Göttingen University, the Brothers Grimm rejected such a complex undertaking. A political scandal then dramatically changed matters. In 1837, the new King of Hanover, Ernst August, dissolved parliament and demanded oaths of allegiance from all civil servants. The brothers and five other professors refused and this so-called &quot;Göttingen Seven&quot; were removed from their positions by royal order. The brothers then became political refugees in their former home in Kassel.

===The Grimms (1838–1863)===
By October 1838, the Brothers had a contract with Weidmann&#x27;s and the prestigious Leipzig journal &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; published an announcement of the start of work on the DWB. The brothers initially expected the project to take ten years and produce 6–7 volumes. Circumstances seemed favorable because they were provided with staff and spacious apartments in Berlin at the invitation of the Prussian Minister in 1841. However, difficulties soon began. Not only did the acquisition of source excerpts take much longer than expected, but illness and the Revolution of 1848 interrupted the work. Eight volumes consisting of 1824 printed columns, a bibliography and a detailed preface were finally published on 13 April 1854.

The first edition of the &quot;DWB&quot; exceeded the expectations of the brothers and the publishers. The press called it a &quot;great national work&quot; and its first shipments sold 10,000 copies. As it included words regarded as &quot;indelicate,&quot; Jacob anticipated criticism of this and stated the following in the Foreword:

:&quot;This dictionary is not an immoral book, but a scientific undertaking. Even the Bible does not lack for words that are frowned upon in fine society.&quot;
::- Jacob Grimm, &quot;Vorwort 1. Band, S. XXXIV&quot; , Leipzig 1854

More volumes and updates were planned, but in their lifetime the brothers could only fully complete portions: Wilhelm Grimm wrote the articles to the letter D and died in 1859; Jacob, who was able to fully complete the letters A, B, C and E, died in 1863 while working on the entry for &quot;Frucht&quot; (fruit).

===Post-Grimm era (1863–1907)===
After the deaths of the Grimm Brothers, successive linguists continued the work. The first of these were close associates of the brothers, Rudolf Hildebrand and Karl Weigand. The &quot;DWB&quot; also became an affair of state when Otto von Bismarck requested the North German Confederation Federal Council to provide state funding in 1867. The young Germanist Moritz Heyne joined the project and became one of its most important contributors. By 1888 Heyne had invited graduate students to post articles under his supervision, turning the DWB into a true consortium for the first time. Included in this group was Rudolf Meißner who collaborated on the &quot;DWB&quot; for six decades (1889–1948). These ever-changing authors had different approaches and the work also proceeded very slowly. Hermann Wunderlich, Hildebrand&#x27;s successor, only finished &quot;Gestüme&quot; to &quot;Gezwang&quot; after 20 years of work and 3000 columns of text. By 1905, academic professionals across Germany were unanimous: management of the DWB had to change or it would never be completed.

===Academy of Sciences (1908–1961)===
The prestigious Prussian Academy of Sciences took on formal development of the &quot;DWB&quot; in 1908 with Göttingen remaining a central collection point for source documents. Operations were streamlined and salaried workers were provided through funding by the Empire. This period of reform and consolidation ended with World War I in 1914. By the early &#x27;20s the project was again close to collapse as German hyperinflation drove costs of production to over 5 billion marks. A donation of just $152 from the United States in 1923 saved the &quot;DWB&quot; from ruin. Max Planck repeatedly advocated for the dictionary and funding was eventually taken up by the Emergency Association of German Science. Due to the efficiencies of a permanent staff of lexicographers as well as standardized policies for production, the period between 1931–1939 saw six times as much work completed as in the previous years. Nearly 100 years after its conception the DWB was permanently institutionalized and its conclusion was in sight.

World War II then paralyzed the work. Employees were drafted into military service, resources were scarce, and the archived holdings were moved to a potash mine at Bernburg an der Saale to protect them from Allied bombing. The remaining three employees continued some work at Schloss Fredersdorf outside Berlin. After the war the USSR granted permission to move the archived materials from Fredersdorf and Bernburg back to Berlin in 1947. The new German Academy of Sciences at Berlin then took on the work of the DWB. With the founding of East Germany in 1949, communication between Berlin and Göttingen became more difficult. Despite these political complications, the &quot;DWB&quot; was finally published in January 1961, 123 years after its beginnings. It totaled 67,744 text columns, 320,000 keywords and weighed 84 kg. A 1971 supplement contains 25,000 additional entries and references to primary sources.

==Later versions==
Planning for a second edition had already begun in 1957, four years before the first edition was finished. The revision was intended especially to bring the oldest part of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;, the letters A-F originally authored by the Brothers Grimm, up to date. It also was to be a cooperative effort between East and West Germany: the Academy of Sciences of the GDR in East Berlin would complete A-C, and the University of Göttingen in the West would complete D-F. The initial fascicles of this revision were published in 1965, but it remains unfinished today, with the letters B and C (originally assigned to the Berlin team) still in progress. The East German Berlin team was greatly hindered for political reasons because the SED authorities saw the DWB as a &quot;bourgeois&quot; lexicography project. In the course of the 1960s, most of its staff were taken off the project and used for other tasks. In 1984, the original 1961 version of the &quot;DWB&quot; was published in a paperback edition, now out of print. In 1999 a new paperback printing of all 33 volumes (weight 30 kg), published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, became available ().

==Digital edition==
In 2004 the Competence Center for Electronic Text Processing and Publication in the Humanities at the University of Trier digitized the entire 300 million printed characters according to the method of double entry. The entire body was manually entered twice in China to eliminate error. A set of CD-ROMs of this digitization was released for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS. In this version spelling errors in the original were corrected. An online version of the first edition is also available at the University of Trier. The digitized first edition of the &quot;DWB&quot; met with lively interest. Every day the online version receives tens of thousands of hits and the CD-ROM of the first edition is now in its fourth updated distribution.

==New edition==
In 2006 the unfinished project to revise and update the A-F volumes to modern academic standards was resumed. The conclusion of this work (the B and C volumes) was finished in 2016; fascicles are appearing with the S. Hirzel Verlag as they are completed.

However, the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities announced that no revision of the volumes G to Z is planned. According to the Academic Director of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy, Wolf-Hagen Krauth, the sheer labor that would be required exceeds the possibilities for funding it in today&#x27;s world.

<doc id="1178188" wikidata="Q311193" url="?curid=1178188" title="Yoshiki (musician)">
<text>, known as Yoshiki, is a Japanese musician, songwriter, composer, record producer, film director, and fashion designer. He is best known as the leader of the visual kei rock bands X Japan and the Last Rockstars, for which he is the drummer, pianist, and main songwriter. He has been described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as a &quot;musical innovator&quot; and named &quot;one of the most influential composers in Japanese history&quot; by &quot;Consequence&quot;. Yoshiki&#x27;s solo career includes several classical studio albums and collaborations with artists such as George Martin, Bono, will.i.am, St. Vincent, the Chainsmokers, Skrillex, Ellie Goulding, Stan Lee, Roger Taylor and Brian May of Queen, Gene Simmons and KISS, Nicole Scherzinger, and Sarah Brightman.

In 1999, at the request of the Japanese royal family, he composed and performed a classical song at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito&#x27;s enthronement. Yoshiki also composed the theme for the 69th Golden Globe Awards as well as for several anime and film soundtracks including &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; and &quot;Saw IV&quot;. In 2023, he made his directorial debut with the feature documentary film &quot;.&quot; 

In 2023, Yoshiki was selected as the first Japanese artist to be honored with a hand and footprint ceremony at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in nearly 100 years. In 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; selected Yoshiki as the International Achievement in Music honoree.

== Life and career ==

=== 1965–1982: early years and Dynamite/Noise ===
Yoshiki was born on November 20, 1965, in Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, as the elder of two brothers in a musically oriented family. His father was a tap dancer and jazz pianist, his mother played the shamisen, while his aunt played the koto. He began taking piano lessons and music theory at age four. He then became interested in classical works by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. In elementary school, he played the trumpet in the brass band, and around age ten started composing songs for piano. This period was a decisive point in his life. He was 10 years old when his father committed suicide; he found relief in rock music. After discovering the music of American hard rock band Kiss, he started learning to play drums and guitar. Yoshiki was also influenced by works from Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Sex Pistols, David Bowie, Queen, the Beatles, Charged GBH and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Yoshiki formed the band Dynamite with his childhood friend Toshi in 1977. Dynamite changed its name to Noise a year later.

=== 1982–1997: X Japan ===
When Noise disbanded in 1982, Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, which they named X while they tried to think of another name, but the name stuck. In 1986, Yoshiki founded his own independent record label, Extasy Records, in order to distribute the band&#x27;s music. On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony which led to a recording contract in August of the following year. The band&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of their second, and major debut, album &quot;Blue Blood&quot;, which reached number six on the Oricon chart and charted for more than 100 weeks. In 1990, the band received the &quot;Grand Prix New Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 1991 they released their hit million-selling album &quot;Jealousy&quot;, and were the first Japanese metal band to perform in Japan&#x27;s largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. The following year they announced the renaming of the band to X Japan in order to launch an international career with an American album release, however, this ultimately did not happen.

=== 1991–1999: solo work and &quot;Eternal Melody&quot; ===
That same year he began his first solo activities outside X. Collaborating with Tetsuya Komuro for the rock unit V2, with a concert on December 5 at the Tokyo Bay NK Hall and the single &quot;Haitoku no Hitomi ~Eyes of Venus~/Virginity&quot; (背徳の瞳〜Eyes of Venus〜) in January 1992, which reached number two on the chart. On December 12, Yoshiki released his first album, the classical compilation &quot;Yoshiki Selection&quot;, which includes classical works, and its sequel followed six years later.

In 1992, he bought a recording studio complex in North Hollywood, California, US. Extasy Recording Studios would become where recordings for nearly all his projects take place, until he sold it in the 2010s. In the early 1990s through his record label would debut million-selling bands Glay and Luna Sea. He began learning about jazz improvisation and orchestration.

On April 21, 1993, he released his first original solo album, the classical studio album &quot;Eternal Melody&quot;, which was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and produced by the Beatles producer George Martin. Besides including orchestral arrangements of X Japan songs, it contained two new songs as well. The album reached number 6 on the charts. On November 3, the singles &quot;Amethyst&quot; and &quot;Ima wo Dakishimete&quot; (今を抱きしめて) were released and reached number five and three respectively on the charts. The later single was a karaoke adaptation of the second orchestral song from the first single, but name credit went to TBS as it was the theme song to one of their dramas, recorded by the lead actors under the group name NOA. In 1994, it was the 35th annual best-selling single and won the &quot;Excellence award&quot; at the &quot;36th Japan Record Awards.

In 1994, Yoshiki worked with Queen drummer Roger Taylor on a song he composed, &quot;Foreign Sand&quot;, for which Roger wrote the lyrics. They performed the song at The Great Music Experience event in May, partly backed by Unesco, which featured many other Japanese and Western musicians. The single was released in June, and reached the top fifteen in Japan, and 26th in the UK. That same month, the Kiss tribute album &quot;Kiss My Ass&quot; was released, for which Yoshiki contributed an orchestral arrangement of &quot;Black Diamond&quot; played by the American Symphony Orchestra.

With X Japan&#x27;s popularity increasing, Yoshiki and the band collaborated with Mugen Motorsports and sponsored racer Katsumi Yamamoto, who drove for team &quot;X Japan Racing&quot; in the 1995 season of Formula Nippon. In the 1996 season, they sponsored Ralf Schumacher with both him and the team winning the championship. In 1997, Toshi decided to leave the band, claiming the success-oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally. The band&#x27;s dissolution was officially announced in September 1997. X Japan performed their farewell show at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive New Year&#x27;s Eve shows in that stadium. Soon afterwards, in May 1998, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist Hide died, and Yoshiki withdrew from the public scene, as he was battling suicidal thoughts and eventually sought the help of a psychiatrist.

Yoshiki remained active as a producer for bands such as Dir En Grey, and contributed a cover song for the 1999 Hide tribute album, &quot;Tribute Spirits&quot;. On November 12, 1999, a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito&#x27;s enthronement was held at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, for which Yoshiki composed and performed the song &quot;Anniversary&quot; at the request of the royal family.

=== 2000–2009: &quot;Eternal Melody II&quot;, Violet UK and S.K.I.N. ===
In the beginning of the 21st century, he expanded his record label with sub-divisions, &quot;Extasy Japan&quot; and &quot;Extasy International&quot; in collaboration with Warner Music, and produced several artists. In 2000, he collaborated with 7-Eleven on a series of TV commercials, for which he provided the songs &quot;Blind Dance&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot; by his solo musical project Violet UK. Two years prior, he contributed the song &quot;Sane&quot; for the 1998 film &quot;In God&#x27;s Hands&quot;. The project idea was born in 1991, when Yoshiki was recording in his studio, initially doing sessions with Mick Karn and Jane Child, but it was postponed. The music involves a fusion of trip rock, breakbeat, and classical piano strings.

In September 2002, he joined the dance-oriented pop group led by Tetsuya Komuro, Globe. Though his only contribution was the single &quot;Seize the Light&quot; and, after recording an album, they went on hiatus with Yoshiki not rejoining them afterwards.

The first two wines, &quot;Y by Yoshiki California Chardonnay 2008&quot; and &quot;Y by Yoshiki California Cabernet Sauvignon 2008&quot; were released in autumn 2009 exclusively in Japan. Yoshiki Chardonnay &#x27;Encore&#x27; California 2017&quot; and &quot;Y by Yoshiki Cabernet Sauvignon California 2017&quot; shipped over 100,000 bottles in their initial release. In 2018, Yoshiki created `&quot;Y by Yoshiki California&quot;, which he called &quot;smart casual&quot;, and released a Rosé wine to the series in 2024.

Yoshiki is personally involved in the selection and creation of each vintage and is a renowned wine connoisseur, demonstrating his wine tasting knowledge on national television in Japan. 

== Equipment ==
Yoshiki said he considers himself a groove drummer. He normally wears a neck brace when playing the drums; as a result of his years of &quot;headbanging&quot; while drumming, he injured his neck and had to undergo surgery. In 2015, Yoshiki stated he is more of a songwriter than a drummer.

Tama Drums created a custom-made acrylic drum set for Yoshiki to use on stage, the ArtStar series. Yoshiki admitted that the clear acrylic shells are great for appearances, allowing the stage lights to color his drums with varying hues, but are not ideal sound-wise. He explained that the clear drums are difficult to play because they do not have the usual responsiveness of wooden shells and are not very durable; as they require much more physical pounding to deliver a good sound and that causes the heads to be essentially ruined after only a single concert. Yoshiki&#x27;s live kit uses two kick drums, and centers the 14&quot; snare drum directly in front of him. He usually works with five tom drums: three rack toms with diameters of 12&quot;, 13&quot;, and 14&quot;, and two floor toms with diameters of 16&quot; and 18&quot;. However, in the studio he uses a limited made titanium kit from Kitano drum called Tama Artstar II &quot;Titan Body&quot; with Evans coated heads.

Yoshiki usually performs on a Kawai Crystal II Grand Piano CR-40A. Kawai also makes a Yoshiki-model grand piano of traditional wooden design.

He has a constant numbness of two fingers on his left hand that he says makes it difficult to play piano. He also suffers from chronic tendonitis on his right hand, which may cause him to be unable to play musical instruments in the future.

<text>Johanna Rachel Fateman (born May 16, 1974) is an American writer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. She is a member of the electropunk band Le Tigre and founded the band MEN with Le Tigre bandmate JD Samson.

== Early life and education ==

Fateman grew up in Berkeley, California, where her father, computer scientist Richard Fateman is a professor at UC Berkeley. On the official Le Tigre website, Fateman refers to filmmaker Miranda July as being her &quot;best friend from high school&quot;; July is also from Berkeley. At the age of seventeen, Fateman moved to Portland, Oregon, to attend Reed College, which she later left for art school in New York City.

== Writing ==
Fateman began her writing career producing zines including &quot;My Need To Speak on the Subject of Jackson Pollock&quot;; &quot;ArtaudMania!!! The Diary of a Fan&quot;; &quot;The Opposite, Part I&quot;; and &quot;SNARLA&quot;, which she co-wrote with Miranda July. It was through her zines that Fateman first met bandmate Kathleen Hanna. At a performance of Hanna&#x27;s band Bikini Kill, Fateman gave Hanna a copy of one of her zines. As Hanna has related in interviews, she was impressed and inspired by Fateman&#x27;s writing, and the two kept in touch.

She donated her early zines and correspondence to New York University, where they are kept in the Riot Grrrl Collection at the Fales Library.

Beginning in 2016, Fateman became a columnist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, regularly contributing to the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Goings On About Town&quot; section. Fateman has also written critically about art and pop culture for &quot;Bookforum&quot;, &quot;Artforum&quot;, and &quot;4Columns&quot;.

== Music career ==
When Bikini Kill was on hiatus, Kathleen Hanna moved to Portland, where she and Fateman lived with several other women in an off-campus Reed College house known as &quot;The Curse&quot;. Radio Sloan, who also lived at The Curse, taught Fateman how to play her first songs on a $60 bass guitar. Around this time, Hanna and Fateman formed their first band together, the Troublemakers, named after the film of the same name by G.B. Jones. The band played at house parties in Portland but broke up when Fateman moved to New York.

=== Le Tigre ===

Hanna soon followed her to the East Coast, and the two women joined forces with filmmaker Sadie Benning to form Le Tigre. After their first album, Benning left the band to return to filmmaking. JD Samson joined the line-up for &quot;Feminist Sweepstakes&quot;, their next release. The band&#x27;s most recent album is &quot;This Island&quot; and in January 2007, they went on hiatus.

In June 2011, a documentary film about Le Tigre&#x27;s final year of touring was released by Oscilloscope Laboratories. &quot;Who Took the Bomp? Le Tigre on Tour&quot;, directed by Kerthy Fix, documents the band&#x27;s live show and features interview footage of the band members reflecting on their experiences.

=== Swim with the Dolphins ===
While working with Le Tigre, Fateman started her own solo project called &quot;Swim with the Dolphins&quot;, named after a self-help book by the same title with the subtitle &quot;How Women Can Succeed in Corporate America on Their Own Terms&quot;. She made a five-song cassette entitled &quot;the struggle for the full exercise of woman&#x27;s equality&quot; during the winter of 1999, which she describes as &quot;sample-based, dj/dance-floor inspired music for the feminist rave in my head&quot;.

=== MEN ===
After Le Tigre went on indefinite hiatus, Fateman and Samson worked together as DJs. They took on the name MEN, eventually adding members and turning into a full musical troupe. Although Fateman left early after becoming pregnant, MEN carried on, making electro-influenced dance music with a political slant.

=== Collaborations ===
Fateman has continued to remix, write and produce music for other artists, often with JD Samson. Fateman, Hanna, and Samson wrote and produced the Christina Aguilera song &quot;My Girls&quot; featuring Peaches for Aguilera&#x27;s album &quot;Bionic&quot;. Fateman wrote about the experience on the Le Tigre blog: &quot;Together we tailored themes and specific references to her personality and image but found a ton of common ground in our aim to make upbeat danceable tracks celebrating female friendship, strength, and of course, PARTYING. And while the giant sound of her stacked vocals and the pop sheen she lends to the tracks might seem at odds with Le Tigre&#x27;s aesthetic roots, it really works. The songs have a lot of elements we&#x27;re known for, like a garage guitar sound, schoolyard chants, new wave-y synths, electro beats, and somehow it all sounds crazily right with Christina&#x27;s unbelievable voice.&quot;

Fateman was the sound designer for experimental filmmaker Cecilia Dougherty&#x27;s &quot;Gone&quot;. She also served as the music director and composer for artist Laura Parnes&#x27; 2011 episodic video work &quot;County Down&quot;. Fateman and Samson are credited as co-writers on the 2011 Cobra Starship song &quot;Shwick&quot;.

== Seagull salon ==
Since 2006, Fateman has been part-owner of a West Village hair salon called Seagull. Established in the 1970s and named after the novel &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;, the salon was the city&#x27;s first unisex barber shop. Fateman runs the business side while her partner, Shaun Surething, handles the styling crew. Surething (a regular collaborator with performance artist K8 Hardy) and Fateman were featured in a short documentary on Current TV.

<text>The East Village Other (often abbreviated as EVO) was an American underground newspaper in New York City, issued biweekly during the 1960s. It was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a New York newspaper so countercultural that it made &quot;The Village Voice&quot; look like a church circular&quot;.

Published by Walter Bowart, &quot;EVO&quot; was among the first countercultural newspapers to emerge. &quot;EVO&quot; was one of the founding members of the Underground Press Syndicate, a network that allowed member papers to freely reprint each other&#x27;s contents.

The paper&#x27;s design, in its first years, was characterized by Dadaistic montages and absurdist, non-sequitur headlines, including regular invocations of the &quot;Intergalactic World Brain.&quot; Later, the paper evolved a more colorful psychedelic layout that became a distinguishing characteristic of the underground papers of the time.

&quot;EVO&quot; was an important publication for the underground comix movement, featuring comic strips by artists including Robert Crumb, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, Spain Rodriguez, Gilbert Shelton and Art Spiegelman, before underground comic books emerged from San Francisco with the first issue of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;.

== Publication history==
The &quot;East Village Other&quot; was co-founded in October 1965 by Walter Bowart, Ishmael Reed (who named the newspaper), Allen Katzman, Dan Rattiner, Sherry Needham, and John Wilcock. It began as a monthly and then went biweekly.

Starting in 1969, Coca Crystal would write about politics, women&#x27;s issues, and personal events for the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, many of which earned her the title &quot;slumgoddess&quot;.

The paper published another short-lived spin-off title, &quot;Kiss,&quot; a sex-oriented paper that was designed to compete with Al Goldstein&#x27;s tabloid &quot;Screw&quot;. There were several other spin-off titles published at the same time, including &quot;Gay Power&quot; (a New York–centric gay liberation paper which survived for about a year), and a brief-lived astrology paper.

In 1968, Bowart departed, moving to Tucson, Arizona, where he founded Omen Press, publishing metaphysical books.

In 1970, &quot;EVO&quot; had a circulation of 65,000 copies.

As 1971 drew to a close, publication of &quot;EVO&quot; became more and more sporadic. It faced mounting financial difficulties, along with increasing staff losses, and the paper ceased publication completely in March 1972.

==Comics==
Early &quot;EVO&quot; issues featured the work of Bill Beckman, Shelton, and Rodriguez, soon adding other artists. The popularity of these strips led to the publication of separate comics tabloids, beginning with &quot;Zodiac Mindwarp&quot; by Rodriguez.

Comics historian Patrick Rosenkranz recalled his reaction to &quot;EVO&quot;:
During 1969, &quot;EVO&quot; published eight issues of &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;, an all-comics tabloid with some color printing, billed as &quot;the first Sunday underground comic paper&quot;. Vaughn Bodé was the founding editor, with early issues featuring work by Bodé, Crumb, Deitch, Robbins, Rodriguez, Spiegelman, Joel Beck, Roger Brand, Ron Haydock, Jay Lynch, Larry Hama, Michael Kaluta, George Metzger, Ralph Reese, Steve Stiles, Robert Williams, S. Clay Wilson, Bernie Wrightson and Bhob Stewart (who became &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;″ second editor).

<doc id="1178200" wikidata="Q7999717" url="?curid=1178200" title="Wigstock">
<text>Wigstock was an annual outdoor drag festival that began in 1984 in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village that took place on Labor Day. Continuing, with a few gaps, until 2005, the festival would traditionally act as the unofficial end to the summer for the gay community of New York City. After a 12-year gap, the festival was revived by Lady Bunny and Neil Patrick Harris on September 1, 2018 at Pier 17 of the South Street Seaport in New York City. The name refers to the 1969 Woodstock Festival.

== History ==
Hosted by co-creator Lady Bunny, the festival was held in its first years in Tompkins Square Park. According to Lady Bunny, the event began spontaneously in 1984 after a group of drag queens (along with Wendy Wild, NYC artist Scott Lifshutz and a couple of Fleshtones) became inebriated at the nearby Pyramid Club and decided to put on a show in the park.

In the mid-1990s, the Giuliani administration prohibited the festival being held in Tompkins Square and Union Square, and moved it to the Hudson River, effectively ensuring it would lose its grassroots activist appeal. Lady Bunny said that 2001&#x27;s Wigstock would be the last, but in 2003, 2004, and 2005, Wigstock and Bunny returned to Tompkins Square, this time under the auspices of the Howl Festival.

== Documentaries ==

In 1987, video artist Tom Rubnitz filmed a 20-minute documentary titled &quot;Wigstock: The Movie&quot;. Rubnitz&#x27;s film captures the event&#x27;s early improvised atmosphere; early years of Wigstock often made direct reference to Woodstock (including performance artist John Kelly&#x27;s send-up of Joni Mitchell and her song &quot;Woodstock&quot;), and Rubnitz&#x27;s film mimics aspects of the 1970 Woodstock concert film.

A second documentary titled &quot;&quot; was released in 1995; the festivals captured are larger and more polished, with rock music largely supplanted by house music, and the influence of the original Woodstock festival less evident. The 1995 film gained a wider audience and was distributed across the country, then released on video and DVD.

The 2019 film &quot;Wig&quot; by Chris Moukarbel explores the festival&#x27;s origins, evolution, and 2018 incarnation.

<text>State Road A1A (SR A1A) is a major north–south Florida State Road consisting of seven separate sections running a total of along the Atlantic Ocean, from Key West at the southern tip of Florida, to Fernandina Beach, just south of Georgia on Amelia Island. It is the main road through most oceanfront towns. Part of SR A1A is designated the A1A Scenic and Historic Coastal Byway, a National Scenic Byway. SR A1A is famous worldwide as a center of beach culture in the United States, a scenic coastal route through most Atlantic coastal cities and beach towns, including the unique tropical coral islands of the Florida Keys. SR A1A also serves as a major thoroughfare through Miami Beach and other south Florida coastal cities.

A portion of SR A1A that passes through Volusia County is designated the [[Ormond Scenic Loop and Trail]], a Florida Scenic Highway. It is also called the [[Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway]] from State Road 510 at Wabasso Beach to U.S. Route 1 in Cocoa. In 2024, the entirety of A1A from Key West to the Georgia state line was designated the [[Jimmy Buffett]] Memorial Highway. Other than SR A1A Alternate (now SR 811, CR 707, SR 732, and an extension of SR 842), only two other Florida state roads have begun with a letter: SR A19A (now a loop of SR 693–SR 699–SR 682 near St. Petersburg), and SR G1A (now SR 300).

The road was designated as State Road 1 in the 1945 renumbering, mostly replacing the former State Road 140 designation. The number reflected its location in the new grid as the easternmost major north–south road. About a year and a half later, in November 1946, the State Road Board resolved to renumber the route due to confusion with the parallel U.S. Highway 1. The new designation, A1A, was chosen to keep the number 1 in its place in the grid.

The East Coast Greenway, a system of trails that connects Maine to Florida, travels along sections of SR A1A.

==Overview==

SR A1A is heavily associated with Florida beach culture and is known for its lush tropical and subtropical scenery and ocean vistas. In many places, the highway runs directly along the waterfront of the Atlantic Ocean, but in other places, it runs one to five blocks inland from the beachfront. For most of its length, SR A1A runs along Florida&#x27;s East Coast Barrier Islands, separated from the mainland of the state by the Intracoastal Waterway. Because of the proximity of the highway to the ocean and its susceptibility to storm surges, sections of SR A1A are often closed or damaged by hurricanes and tropical storms.

SR A1A also has been a backbone of Florida&#x27;s spring break serving as &quot;the strip&quot; in both Fort Lauderdale – a popular spring break destination during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s – and Daytona Beach, which became a popular destination for college spring breaks during the 1970s. Today, SR A1A serves as more a main coastal highway that connects beach towns for more than along Florida&#x27;s east coast.

==Route description==

Though SR A1A runs from Key West to north of Jacksonville, the designation is not one continuous route. In some areas such as the Florida Keys, there is no oceanfront highway (other than the Overseas Highway, US 1), other parts of the coast are served by county roads (sometimes designated County Road A1A) rather than state roads, and still other areas are restricted by geography (inlets) or usage (e.g. nature preserves and the Kennedy Space Center). The longest of the route&#x27;s seven sections runs from Stuart to Cocoa, while three of the sections are less than long

The southern terminus of the first section of SR A1A is at the southern end of Bertha Street, where SR A1A begins as a two-lane, then a four-lane highway along the Straits of Florida in Key West, known locally as South Roosevelt Boulevard. The road heads east past East Martello Tower and Key West International Airport, before curving north with an intersection with CR 5A (Flagler Avenue), followed by the northern terminus of the Key West section of SR A1A, U.S. Route 1 and State Road 5 (the Overseas Highway). Running along the south shore of Key West, SR A1A is the southernmost numbered highway in the lower 48 states.

SR A1A reappears at Interstate 395 and US 1 in Miami, beginning at MacArthur Causeway before becoming Collins Avenue at Fifth Street in Miami Beach (or, in small segments, Harding Avenue, Abbott Avenue, or Indian Creek Drive), serving as one of Miami Beach&#x27;s main north — south thoroughfares. Just north in the town of Surfside, the northbound is Collins Avenue, and the southbound is Harding Avenue. In Bal Harbour it is called Bal Harbour Boulevard. In Golden Beach it is called Ocean Boulevard.

It serves Hallandale Beach, Hollywood Beach, and Dania Beach. It joins with US 1 for 3.4 miles, and passes the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. It then divides and serves Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, and continuing north.

It serves as the main road throughout much of the exclusive Palm Beach, further to the north.

In the area of Vero Beach, SR A1A is called the Robert C. Spillman Memorial Highway, and it spans Sebastian Inlet at the Sebastian Inlet Bridge.

SR A1A next passes just to the west of Cape Canaveral and the John F. Kennedy Space Center.

Two miles of SR A1A were used as part of the well-known Daytona Beach Road Course.

SR A1A also passes through St. Augustine, the oldest continuously-inhabited city on the mainland of the United States.

SR A1A is called 3rd Street in Jacksonville Beach and Neptune Beach.

Just south of Atlantic Beach, SR A1A turns inland for several blocks, following Atlantic Boulevard, before resuming a northward course along Mayport Road that ends at the St. Johns River. A ferry takes traffic to the northern section of SR A1A that continues along the coast to just south of Fort Clinch State Park on the estuary of the Saint Mary&#x27;s River. At that point SR A1A hooks back south to Fernandina Beach and then turns west, going inland 20 miles through Yulee and crossing I-95 and U.S. Highway 17. It ends at U.S. Highway 1, U.S. Highway 23, and U.S. Highway 301 in Callahan. This section west of Fernandina Beach, is also marked as SR 200, but SR A1A signs are displayed at every cluster of signs, though a designated direction is only above the SR 200 signs.

==History==

===Pre-1945 alignment===


Prior to the 1945 renumbering, the route that became SR 1 had the following numbers:
===Initial alignment===


SR 1 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as:
===Alignment modifications===
Since then, the following changes have been made:
===Jungle Trail===

The Jungle Trail (pre-1945 State Road 252) was part of A1A in northeastern Indian River County, Florida. The narrow, road is located between Old Winter Beach Road and the current A1A, along the western side of Orchid Island, and is unpaved. It is part of the Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway system, and the southernmost road in the highway system. Part of the trail goes through the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge.

The road started as a means to quickly transport citrus to packinghouses on the mainland, then in the 1930s and 1940s became more used by tourists. On August 1, 2003, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places.
==Major intersections==












































==County Road A1A==

County Road A1A is a county road in four counties in the U.S. state of Florida. The route is discontinuous and functions as a spur of State Road A1A.

===Palm Beach County===
CR A1A in Palm Beach County is a former routing of SR A1A through Juno Beach and Jupiter. It serves as a paralleling alternate route to Federal Highway (US 1), and is often erroneously signed as SR A1A despite its official county designation and maintenance.

===Martin County===
The longest of the four county spurs, County Road A1A is that runs along the Florida East Coast Railroad main line from Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Hobe Sound to Stuart, where it suddenly changes course and runs east along the south coast of the St. Lucie River. After the terminus of SR 714, it approaches the Evans Crary Bridge separating Stuart and Sewall&#x27;s Point and becomes SR A1A.

===Volusia County===

County Road A1A is a spur route of State Road A1A in Volusia County, Florida, United States. The route begins at U.S. Route 1 and State Road A1A in Downtown New Smyrna Beach as Lytel Avenue. Next, the route crosses the Intracoastal Waterway and Callalisa Creek before heading southbound. After the 2 bridges, the road becomes 3rd Avenue, the northern terminus of Saxon Drive as the first right after Callalisa Creek. East of Indian River Village Shopping Center, the road turns southward and becomes Atlantic Avenue. At the intersection of 27th Avenue, the road becomes 2 lanes wide. Less than a mile south of New Smyrna Beach, Saxon Drive ends. At Bethune Beach, the road slightly turns away from the Atlantic Ocean. The road becomes Turtle Mound Road at that point. After Bethune Beach, the road is midway between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean. At this point, a gate brings access to Canaveral National Seashore. It passes through the ghost town of Eldora. The road ends as a dead end at a beach.

===St. Johns County===
County Road A1A is a spur route of SR A1A in St. Augustine Beach that runs closer to the Atlantic Ocean than SR A1A. It runs northeast from SR A1A, but begins to straighten out between John Drive and a private driveway south of F Street. The closest thing resembling a major intersection is 16th Street. After passing by the St Johns County Ocean Pier, the road intersects Pope Road and leaves the city limits, where it enters Anastasia State Park, and makes a sharp curve to the west. Once the road leaves the park, it features an exceptionally long west-to-north turning ramp towards SR A1A, but ends at the intersection of SRs A1A and 312.

==References in popular culture==
* A1A is mentioned in the 1990 Vanilla Ice song &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; with the lyrics &quot;A1A (Beachfront Avenue)&quot;; in Miami&#x27;s South Beach, A1A is named Collins Avenue, but &quot;Beachfront Avenue&quot; is a common nickname.
* &quot;A1A&quot; is the title of a 1974 album by Jimmy Buffett; one of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Trying to Reason with Hurricane Season&quot;, also mentions the road. In 2024, A1A from Key West to the Georgia border was designated the Jimmy Buffett Memorial Highway.

<text>Charles Alexander Jencks (June 21, 1939 – October 13, 2019) was an American cultural theorist, landscape designer, architectural historian, and co-founder of the Maggie&#x27;s Cancer Care Centres. He published over thirty books and became famous in the 1980s as a theorist of postmodernism. Jencks devoted time to landform architecture, especially in Scotland. These landscapes include the &quot;Garden of Cosmic Speculation&quot; and earthworks at Jupiter Artland outside Edinburgh. His continuing project &quot;Crawick Multiverse&quot;, commissioned by the Duke of Buccleuch, opened in 2015 near Sanquhar.

==Early years and family life==

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 21, 1939, Charles Alexander Jencks was the son of composer Gardner Platt Jencks and Ruth DeWitt Pearl. Jencks attended Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature at Harvard University in 1961 and a Master of Arts degree in architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1965. In 1965 Jencks moved to the United Kingdom where he had houses in Scotland and London. In 1970, Jencks received a PhD in architectural history, studying under the noted historian Reyner Banham at University College, London. This thesis was the source for his &quot;Modern Movements in Architecture&quot; (1973) which used semiotics and other literary critical methods to study twentieth century architecture.

Jencks married Pamela Balding in 1961 and the marriage ended in 1973. They had two sons: one works as a landscape architect in Shanghai, while the other works for Jardines in Vietnam. He married secondly to Maggie Keswick Jencks, daughter of Sir John Keswick and Clare Elwes, by whom he had two children: John Keswick Jencks, a London-based filmmaker, married to Amy Agnew, and Lily Clare Jencks, who married Roger Keeling in 2014. Jencks married Louisa Lane Fox as his third wife in 2006, and was thus the stepfather of her son Henry Lane Fox and daughter Martha Lane Fox.

==Architectural design==

Jencks&#x27; first architectural design was a studio in the woods, a cheap mass-produced garage structure of $5,000 – titled &quot;The Garagia Rotunda&quot;, where he spent part of the summers with his family. The ad hoc use of readymade materials was championed in his polemical text with Nathan Silver &quot;Adhocism – the Case for Improvisation&quot; in 1971 and 2013. Jencks&#x27; architectural designs experimented with ideas from complexity theory.

Jencks designed his own London house in tandem with Maggie Keswick and postmodern architects including Terry Farrell and Michael Graves. He named this home &quot;Thematic House&quot;.

==Maggie&#x27;s Centres==

After his second wife Maggie Keswick Jencks died in 1995, Jencks helped co-found and Maggie&#x27;s Cancer Caring Centres. Based on the notion of self-help and the fact that cancer patients are often involved in a long, drawn-out struggle, the centres provide social and psychological help in an attractive setting next to large hospitals. Their architecture, landscape, and art are designed to support both patients and caregivers and to give dignity to those who, in the past, often hid their disease. Maggie Keswick Jencks is the author of the book &quot;The Chinese Garden&quot;, on which her husband also worked.

==Landscape architecture and landforms==

Jencks switched to landscape design as a site for symbolic exploration when Maggie asked Charles to design in the family home and garden in Scotland. The result in 2003 was the &quot;Garden of Cosmic Speculation&quot;, a series of twenty areas designed around various metaphors such as the DNA garden, Quark Walk, Fractal terrace and Comet Bridge. Further hybrid landforms and symbolic sculptures were built in Edinburgh, Milan, Long Island, New York, Cambridge, Suncheon, South Korea (with Lily Jencks), and other countries, some works from which were published in &quot;The Universe in The Landscape&quot;, 2011.

From 2010, Jencks started work on the &quot;Crawick Multiverse&quot;, a fifty-five-acre site in southwest Scotland and completed it in 2015.
The &quot;Metaphysical Landscape&quot;, was an exhibition of sculpture at Jupiter Artland, 2011. Jencks later exhibited at the Merz Gallery, Sanquhar 2016.

The &quot;Garden of Cosmic Speculation&quot;, designed in part by Jencks and begun in 1988, was dedicated to Jencks&#x27; late wife Maggie Keswick Jencks. Jencks, his wife, scientists, and their friends designed the garden based on natural and scientific processes. Jencks&#x27; goal was to celebrate nature, but he also incorporated elements from the modern sciences into the design. The garden contains species of plants that are pleasurable to the eye, as well as edible. Preserving paths and the traditional beauty of the garden was still his concern, however Jencks enhanced the cosmic landscape using new tools and artificial materials. Just as Japanese Zen gardens, Persian paradise gardens, and the English and French Renaissance gardens were analogies for the universe, the design represents the cosmic and cultural evolution of the contemporary world. The garden is a microcosm – as one walks through the gardens they experience the universe in miniature. According to Jencks, gardens are also autobiographical because they reveal the happiest moments, the tragedies, and the truths of the owner and family.

As the garden developed, so too did such sciences as cosmology, and this allowed a dynamic interaction between the unfolding universe, an unfolding science, and a questioning design. Jencks believed that contemporary science is potentially a great moving force for creativity, because it tells us the truth about the way the universe is and shows us the patterns of beauty. As explained in his book &quot;The Universe in the Landscape&quot; (2011), his work is content-driven. His many landforms are based on the idea that landform building is a radical hybrid activity combining gardens, landscape, urbanism, architecture, sculpture, and epigraphy. Thus, the landforms often include enigmatic writing and complex symbolism. They provoke the visitor to interpret landscape on the largest and smallest scale.
Jencks became a leading figure in British landscape architecture. His landscape work was inspired by black holes, fractals, genetics, chaos theory, waves and solitons. In Edinburgh, Scotland, he designed the landform at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in collaboration with Terry Farrell and Duncan Whatmore of Terry Farrell and Partners. Jencks&#x27; other works include the &quot;Garden of Cosmic Speculation&quot; at Portrack House near Dumfries; Jencks work with landforms also inspired the creators of Ariel Foundation Park in Mount Vernon, Ohio Ted Schnormeier was the Project Manager and Robert J. Stovicek was the architect/designer and together they created thirty plus acres of terraces (landforms). Further inspiration was from the &#x27;Mound building&#x27; culture of central Ohio. The Adena, Hopewell and Mound building peoples created &#x27;landforms&#x27; that still exist today - long before Jencks, Schnormeier or Stovicek were creating anything; Designs for Black Hole Landscape, IUCAA, Pune, India, 2002; Portello Park, Milan 2002–2007 (Time Garden 2004–2007); Two Cells – Inverness Maggie&#x27;s Centre, 2003–2005; Northumberlandia Landform, 2004; Cells of Life, Jupiter Artland, Bonnington House 2003–2010; &quot;Crawick Multiverse&quot;, 2006–; Memories of the Future landform and reclamation project, Altdobern, Germany; Wu Chi, Black Hole Oval Terrace, Beijing Olympic Park, 2008; and The Scottish World, St. Ninians, Kelty, 2003, 2010+.

Jencks was also a furniture designer and sculptor, completing DNA sculptures at Kew Gardens in 2003 and Cambridge University in 2005.

==Architectural writing==
Jencks discussed his theories of postmodern architecture in &quot;The Language of Post-Modern Architecture&quot; (1977), which ran to seven editions. He examined the paradigm shift from modern to postmodern architecture, claiming that modern architecture concentrates on univalent forms such as right angles and square buildings often resembling office buildings. However, postmodern architecture focuses on forms derived from the mind, body, city context, and nature. In 2007, he published ″&quot;Critical Modernism&quot;″, the fifth edition of his &quot;What is Post-Modernism?&quot;

In &quot;Meaning in Architecture&quot;, 1969, co-edited with George Baird, a hypertext of leading architects and theorists commenting on each other&#x27;s texts, Jencks addressed issues of who is the ultimate user of architecture, what values should be crystallised in architecture, and what public architecture should represent. This was followed by other anthologies on semiotics.

In 1987, Rizzoli published his important interdisciplinary survey of new developments towards a hybrid of classicism or Neo-classicism and modernism in art and architecture &quot;Post-modernism: the new classicism in art and architecture&quot;.

His book &quot;The Iconic Building&quot; explored trend setting and celebrity culture. He claimed that the reason that modern culture seeks the &quot;iconic building&quot; is because it has the possibility of reversing the economic trend of a flagging &quot;conurbation&quot;. An iconic building is created to make a splash, to generate money, and the normal criteria of valuation do not apply. He wrote that “enigmatic signifiers” can be used in an effective way to support the deeper meaning of the building.

His book &quot;Critical Modernism - Where is Post-Modernism Going?&quot; came out in 2007. It is an overview of postmodernism in which Jencks argues that postmodernism is a critical reaction to modernism which comes from within modernism itself. On March 26, 2007, the Royal Academy hosted a debate between Jencks and John N. Gray centered around the book.

&quot;The Story of Post-Modernism, Five Decades of the Ironic, Iconic and Critical in Architecture&quot;, 2011, summarise the history of the movement since its origins in the 1960s.
