<text>M Squad is an American crime drama television series that ran from 1957 to 1960 on NBC. It was produced by Lee Marvin&#x27;s Latimer Productions and Revue Studios. Its main sponsor was the Pall Mall cigarette brand; Lee Marvin, the program&#x27;s star, appeared in its commercials during many episodes. Alternate sponsors were General Electric (GE), Hazel Bishop and Bulova watches.

==Synopsis==
Set in Chicago, Illinois, the show starred Marvin as Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, a member of &quot;M Squad&quot;, a special unit of the Chicago Police, assisting other units in battling organized crime, corruption and violent crimes citywide. Paul Newlan co-starred as his boss, Captain Grey. Although Marvin had been appearing in feature films since 1951, it was this series that made him a star, and he later went on to an even bigger film career afterward. Nelson Case was the announcer. The popularity of &quot;M Squad&quot; was proven in the ratings wars by the NBC network choosing a Friday night time slot opposite Frank Sinatra&#x27;s ABC variety show in the fall of 1957 and Phil Silvers&#x27; long running CBS comedy, &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot;, in 1958. Both series were eventually cancelled.

==Music==
The theme music for the first season was composed by Stanley Wilson, who won the 1959 Grammy Award for the Best Soundtrack Album and Background Score from Motion Picture or Television. In the second and third seasons, the new theme was composed by Count Basie.

A soundtrack album, &quot;Music from M Squad&quot;, with liner notes by Lee Marvin, was released by RCA Victor Records in 1959 during the last season of the show.

==Home media==
Timeless Media Group released &quot;M Squad: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in the Region 1 on November 11, 2008. This release has been discontinued and is out of print.

On November 4, 2014, Timeless Media re-released the complete series on DVD in a new 16-disc special edition collection that contains an entire disc of bonus content.

==Notes==

In episode &quot;The Jumper&quot;, an officer was depicted taking bribes. This prompted Richard J. Daley, the Mayor of Chicago at the time, to discourage motion picture and television location filming in Chicago for the rest of his administration (1955–1976). (He made an exception for the 1975 John Wayne film &quot;Brannigan&quot;, because of Daley&#x27;s personal admiration for Wayne.) &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, released in 1980, marked the reversal of the policy under then-mayor Jane Byrne.

Lee Marvin as Lt. Frank Ballinger carried two Colt Cobra snub nosed revolvers, the lightweight variant of Colt&#x27;s &quot;Detective&#x27;s Special&quot; revolver, which was popular with detectives at the time. Lt. Ballinger was the first TV police detective, of any note, to carry a backup revolver. The second Cobra revolver was carried in a more concealed position than the other.

A novel was published in 1962, &quot;M Squad: The Chicago Cop Killer, &quot; by David Saunders. It was published by Belmont Books, New York.

The 1982 TV series &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, which spun off the movie &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; and its sequels, was a direct parody of &quot;M Squad&quot;. The opening credits of &quot;Police Squad&quot; are a shot-for-shot parody of the &quot;M Squad&quot; opening, and the &quot;Police Squad&quot; pilot is an extended line-for-line, shot-for-shot send-up of the season 2 &quot;M Squad&quot; episode &quot;More Deadly&quot;.

<doc id="1163329" wikidata="Q1026817" url="?curid=1163329" title="California Guitar Trio">
<text>California Guitar Trio (CGT) is an acoustic–electric band formed in Los Angeles in 1991 with the aim of expanding the potential of acoustic guitars played in the New standard tuning (NST) introduced by Robert Fripp on Guitar Craft courses. The California Guitar Trio&#x27;s core lineup consisted of Paul Richards, Bert Lams, and Hideyo Moriya. Today&#x27;s CGT lineup includes founding members Richards and Lams, with the addition of Tom Griesgraber, a Chapman Stick virtuoso. Highly regarded instrumentalists, the CGT have achieved worldwide renown for their eclectic repertoire, precision arrangements, and expansive sonic palette. The California Guitar Trio has toured globally for over three decades, performing more than 2,000 concerts. CGT has released 21 albums, with their music being streamed over 120 million times on Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.

==History and formation==

===Formation: The California Project===

The original members of California Guitar Trio met on the series of Robert Fripp&#x27;s Guitar Craft courses in England in 1987. The three original members—Paul Richards of Salt Lake City, Utah, Bert Lams of Affligem, Belgium, and Hideyo Moriya of Tokyo, Japan—toured as part of Robert Fripp and The League of Crafty Guitarists. After completing the 1991 tour of Europe with the League of Crafty Guitarists, Fripp asked Lams to write down a list of musical aims, materials, strategy, and possible collaborators for what was called the California Project. Lams named two other Guitar Craft students as potential collaborators who would be willing to move temporarily to Los Angeles to work with him on this project based out of his home: Richards and Moriya. Thus the California Project ultimately became the California Guitar Trio. The first official performance of the California Guitar Trio took place on February 7, 1991. They continue to play in the New Standard Tuning using amplified acoustic guitars and various combinations of effects, guitar synthesizers and live loop recording as part of their performances. Their performances and recordings include original compositions, surf covers, and arrangements of classical music created for the New Standard Tuning and their tight interplay style known as &quot;circulation&quot; in the Guitar Craft parlance. Their influences include European classical music, rock, blues, jazz, world music, and surf music.

===Robert Fripp String Quintet===

In 1992 and 1993 with Fripp and Trey Gunn, they toured and recorded as The Robert Fripp String Quintet. Several recordings of those performances are available through Fripp&#x27;s DGMLive website.
===First albums on DGM Records===

In 1991, the CGT self-released their self-titled demo album, recorded in Bert Lams&#x27; home just outside Hollywood, California. The recordings on this release were remastered by Tony Arnold and augmented with two additional tracks to form their first CD released on Fripp&#x27;s Discipline Global Mobile record label (now Inner Knot Records), the 1993 album &quot;Yamanashi Blues&quot;, 

In 1995, the trio were invited by physicist and Nobel Laureate Murray Gell-Mann to record at his residence near Lamy, New Mexico. The resulting album &quot;Invitation&quot; includes pieces that were inspired by the landscape (&quot;Train to Lamy Suite&quot;), and arrangements of pieces inspired by their surroundings, such as the theme from &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; and &quot;Apache&quot;. 

Later in 1995, Fripp asked the trio to be the opening act for King Crimson. CGT opened for King Crimson for more than 130 shows in the US, Europe and Japan, exposing their music to a global audience. A sample of these performances were released on their album &quot;An Opening Act&quot;.

In 1998, CGT released &quot;Pathways&quot;, in similar format to the first two albums, with combinations of original compositions, arrangements of classical pieces, and surf guitar songs. 

===Collaborative era===

In 1999, the trio began touring with bassist and Stick player Tony Levin whom they had met on their tours with King Crimson. Levin appears on the CGT albums &quot;Rocks The West&quot; and &quot;Monday Night in San Francisco&quot;, and contemporaneously invited CGT to play his album Waters of Eden. Other collaborators of the time included saxophonist Bill Janssen and percussionist Jarrod Kaplan.

In 2001, CGT toured with Tony Levin and King Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto. After the tour, they released a live recording from this tour (&quot;Live at The Key Club&quot;) and recorded the album &quot;CG3+2&quot; in Austin, Texas with Levin and Mastelotto. 2001 also saw the release of &quot;10 Christmas Songs&quot;, which has accounted for some of the most popular CGT renditions on streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora (streaming service).

In August 2004, they released &quot;Whitewater&quot;, produced by Tony Levin. It features mainly original works of the CGT, offset by a circulation arrangement of a Bach prelude and a mashup of &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot; with The Doors&#x27; &quot;Riders on the Storm.&quot; During this period, CGT began touring with their own sound engineer, Tyler Trotter. Trotter would often accompany the trio on melodica during live improvisations and performances of Tubular Bells. 

The next studio release by CGT was 2008&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot;, with reworkings of other artists&#x27; songs, such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s Echoes, Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield, Music For a Found Harmonium, and Queen&#x27;s Bohemian Rhapsody, which became a staple of their live performances. This was followed in 2010 by &quot;Andromeda&quot;, the first CGT album with all original compositions. Trotter served as co-producer and engineer of both albums.

===Montreal Guitar Trio===

In 2009, CGT performed their first shows with the . The album &quot;Montreal Guitar Trio + California Guitar Trio&quot; captures these first live performances, with each trio performing their own works and playing as a sextet for the encore. They toured together on a shared bill, and in 2019 recorded &quot;In A Landscape&quot;, showcasing all six musicians playing together as a single ensemble.

===2012 to present===

The 2012 release, &quot;Masterworks&quot;, is an all classical music compilation featuring music by Beethoven, Bach, Vivaldi, Rossini and Arvo Pärt. Guitarist Fareed Haque played on Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Winter&quot;, and Tony Levin played upright bass and cello on four tracks.

The next album was the 2016 release of &quot;Komorebi&quot;, which was the first CGT album to utilize crowdfunding to offset the production costs. The album is notable for its purely acoustic sound, whereas most previous CGT recordings featured some use of audio effects, amplification, loops and synthesized sounds integrated with acoustic guitars. It was recorded by Tom Griesgraber in his Encinitas, California studio. Mastering for this album was done by Brian Lucey, another Guitar Craft student and notable mastering engineer and producer. 

Their latest studio album is 2020&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot;, and a subsequent tour was planned and later rescheduled as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The group resumed touring in July 2021 as an opening act for King Crimson, followed by a brief tour of the US in the fall of 2021.

==Members==

The three founding members of California Guitar Trio recorded and performed together continuously from 1991 until 2020. When the trio were asked to open for King Crimson on their 2021 US tour, Moriya was unable to accompany them. Stick player, producer and recording engineer Tom Griesgraber, who had collaborated with CGT as an opening act, record producer and touring/recording partner with Bert Lams, was asked to step in as the third touring member in the summer of 2021. Griesgraber has been a touring member of the band since. As of 2022, Moriya is on hiatus as a touring member of CGT. 

The members of CGT all reside in different places but continue to come together for touring and recording projects. Richards lives in West Hollywood, California; Lams resides in Jupiter, Florida; Moriya lives in Chiba-ken, Japan; Griesgraber lives in Encinitas, California. 

==Tours==

<doc id="1163332" wikidata="Q1929603" url="?curid=1163332" title="Introducing... The Beatles">
<text>Introducing... The Beatles is the first studio album released by the English rock band the Beatles in the United States. Originally scheduled for a July 1963 release, the LP came out on 10 January 1964, on Vee-Jay Records, ten days before Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; The latter album, however, entered the U.S. album chart one week before the former. Consequently, when &quot;Meet The Beatles!&quot; peaked at for eleven consecutive weeks, &quot;Introducing...The Beatles&quot; stalled at where it remained for nine consecutive weeks. It was the subject of much legal wrangling, but ultimately, Vee-Jay was permitted to sell the album until late 1964, by which time it had sold more than 1.3 million copies. On 24 July 2014 the album was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA.

==Initial non-release==
The Beatles&#x27; recording contract that began May 1962 with Parlophone in the United Kingdom gave the parent corporation EMI rights to offer any of the group&#x27;s recordings to the various labels EMI owned in many countries of the world. However, EMI&#x27;s United States subsidiary, Capitol Records, declined to release the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; single. Following this, Transglobal, an EMI affiliate that worked to place foreign masters with US record companies, negotiated with several labels before Vee-Jay Records signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles&#x27; records for five years. As part of that agreement, even after its singles releases of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;From Me to You&quot; failed to chart above No. 116 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Vee-Jay planned to release the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album in the US, and received copies of the mono and stereo master tapes in late April or early May 1963.

Originally, Vee-Jay considered releasing the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; LP unaltered, as it appeared in the UK. A surviving acetate made by Universal Recording Corporation of Chicago, probably in May 1963, contains all 14 songs in the same order as on the UK album, with the title still listed as &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. But in keeping with the American norm of a 12-song album, Vee-Jay chose instead to omit &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; (which had comprised the first single release) and change the album&#x27;s title to &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. Also, the engineer at Universal in Chicago thought that Paul McCartney&#x27;s count-in at the start of &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was extraneous rather than intentionally placed there, so he snipped the &quot;one, two, three&quot; (leaving the &quot;four&quot;) from Vee-Jay&#x27;s mono and stereo masters. Except for those omissions, the order and contents of the album were untouched, resulting in a US album that bore the closest resemblance to a British Beatles LP until &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in 1967.

Preparations for the LP&#x27;s release continued in late June and early July 1963, including the manufacturing of masters and metal parts and the printing of 6,000 front covers. But, despite the claims of many older Beatles books and discographies that &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; was first released on 22 July 1963, no documentation exists to confirm that the album was released at any time in 1963.

A management shake-up at Vee-Jay, which included the resignation of the label&#x27;s president Ewart Abner after he used company money to cover personal gambling debts, resulted in the cancellation of the release of &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; and albums by Frank Ifield, Alma Cogan and a Jewish cantor.

==Version one==
Vee-Jay&#x27;s financial problems forced it to take care of its most pressing debt first. Because the Beatles and Ifield were low priorities, the label chose not to report royalties on their sales. As a result, Transglobal declared its contract with Vee-Jay null and void on 8 August 1963. The next single, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, was licensed by Transglobal to the Swan label of Philadelphia.

On 14 December 1963, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine mentioned that Capitol Records planned an all-out promotional campaign for the Beatles in the United States. Following that, the single &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was rush released on 26 December. On 7 January 1964, Vee-Jay&#x27;s board of directors met for the first time since the single was released, and it discussed the Beatles&#x27; material it had in the vault. Desperate for cash, the board decided to release &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;, even if it meant legal trouble in the future.

Metal parts were already at Vee-Jay&#x27;s three primary pressing plants, and 6,000 front covers were already printed. But it had no back cover prepared. So, as a stopgap, the label used a back cover slick made from one side of its standard inner sleeve, consisting of full-colour reproductions of the covers of 25 &quot;other fine albums of significant interest&quot;. This cover is known by collectors as the &quot;Ad Back&quot; version and is highly sought. A second stopgap back cover was used when the &quot;Ad Back&quot; slicks were exhausted; because it is all-white with no printing at all, it is known by collectors as the &quot;Blank Back&quot; edition and is also very rare. Finally, third editions contain Vee-Jay&#x27;s official back cover, with &quot;Introducing The Beatles&quot; near the top and the song titles in two columns underneath. All of these were available on the market within days of the 10 January release date. Also in January, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was reissued as a single, this time with &quot;From Me to You&quot; as the B-side.

But on 16 January 1964, less than a week after &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; was released, Vee-Jay was served with a restraining order stopping further distribution. Beechwood Music, Inc., Capitol Records&#x27; publishing subsidiary, owned the American publishing rights to &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, and because the two songs had not yet been officially released in the US, Beechwood refused to issue a license for Vee-Jay to release them. Approximately 80,000 copies of &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; had been released with the two songs on them, with only 2,000 or so in stereo.

==Version two==
To circumvent the restraining order, Vee-Jay quickly reconfigured &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. It removed &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and replaced them with the previously omitted &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, though some pressings of the album did not alter the track list. The new versions were prepared in late January and began appearing in stores around 10 February 1964.

Because of the initial restraining order, version two of &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts until three weeks after Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; album. Once it did, it quickly rose to the number two spot, where it stayed for nine straight weeks. It also peaked at number two in &quot;Cash Box&quot;, and it got to number one in &quot;Record World&quot; magazine. This success inspired a host of other Vee-Jay releases. First came the album &quot;Jolly What! England&#x27;s Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage&quot; issued on 26 February, containing the Beatles tracks &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;From Me to You&quot;, &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; and &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; from the 1963 singles and &quot;Introducing...&quot;, and other tracks from Frank Ifield. The rereleased single &quot;Please Please Me&quot; rose to number three on the &quot;Hot 100&quot;, &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;. Soon after, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was released 2 March on the subsidiary Tollie label with &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; as the B-side, and &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, with &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; on the B-side, was issued on 23 March. Both singles went up to number two on the &quot;Hot 100&quot;, with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; reaching number one on both &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;. Also a Beatles EP titled &quot;Souvenir of Their Visit to America&quot; was released by Vee-Jay on 23 March, featuring &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;, and &quot;Anna&quot;.

Even with the replacement of the two Beechwood Music songs, Vee-Jay and Capitol battled in court throughout the early part of 1964. Injunctions against Vee-Jay&#x27;s album were issued, lifted and restored more than once. Because the album was often pressed quickly between restraining orders, there are almost two dozen different label variations, including mono and stereo copies, manufactured at numerous pressing plants. Finally, on 9 April 1964, the two labels settled. Vee-Jay was granted a license giving it the right to issue the 16 Beatles&#x27; songs it controlled, in any way it saw fit, until 15 October 1964. At that time, its license expired, and all rights would revert to Capitol. During the time &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; was available, it sold approximately 1,300,000 mono copies and approximately 41,000 stereo copies. Because only 3.1 percent of all of the LPs were in stereo, true stereo copies are rare.

After the settlement, the Beechwood songs were issued by Vee-Jay as a single, on 27 April on Tollie. &quot;Love Me Do&quot;/&quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; rose to become the Beatles&#x27; fourth number one single on &quot;Billboard&quot; and their fifth on both &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;.

==Other versions==

Twice before its license expired, Vee-Jay repackaged &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. Although neither album contained any new music, both of them made the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts.

=== &quot;Songs, Pictures and Stories of the Fabulous Beatles&quot; ===
One of these was &quot;Songs, Pictures and Stories of the Fabulous Beatles&quot; (Vee-Jay VJLP(S)-1092), which featured a three-quarters gatefold cover, portrait paintings of the four musicians and the text:

:&quot;Look inside. Complete story of their favourite male and female singer, their favourite foods, types of girls, sport, hobby, songs, colours, real name, birthplace, birthdays, height, education, color of hair &amp; eyes.&quot;

The inside cover text describes Paul as the &quot;Nut Beatle&quot; or &quot;Beatle Nut&quot;, John as &quot;nearsighted&quot; and the &quot;Chief Beatle&quot;, George as the &quot;quietest&quot; and the &quot;one with the deadpan face&quot; and Ringo as the &quot;shortest Beatle&quot; who &quot;will send his steak back if it is not blood red&quot;. The back sleeve shows outlines of hearts below each Beatle-photo and holds instructions of how to fill the hearts with personal photos.

The record inside the cover did not even contain the new name; it still stated &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; on the label. &quot;Songs, Pictures and Stories&quot; was released either in late July 1964 or 12 October 1964, with the latter the more likely date, because it entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart on 31 October. It eventually peaked at number 63.

=== &quot;The Beatles vs the Four Seasons&quot; ===
The other repackaging was the two-record set &quot;The Beatles vs the Four Seasons&quot;, which contained copies of &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; in one pocket of the gatefold cover and &quot;Golden Hits of the Four Seasons&quot; (VJLP 1065), a compilation album featuring Vee-Jay&#x27;s other marquee artist The Four Seasons, in the other. This Vee-Jay creation spent three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in October 1964 and peaked at number 142. The cover artwork for this version was later parodied for the bootleg release &quot;The Beatles vs the Third Reich&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s 1962 Star-Club recordings.

Though Vee-Jay could not manufacture or distribute any Beatles product after 15 October 1964, it took a long time for the records to vanish from retail stores. Both &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; and &quot;Songs, Pictures and Stories of the Fabulous Beatles&quot; remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; LP chart until 9 January 1965.

=== After Vee Jay license expired: &quot;The Early Beatles&quot;, &quot;Rarities&quot; ===
From the start of Beatlemania in the United States until the October 1964 expiration of its rights to Beatles music, Vee-Jay issued four LP albums, four singles, and an EP out of the 16 tracks it gained from its 1963 license period. On 22 March 1965, Capitol issued &quot;The Early Beatles&quot;, which contains 11 of the 14 tracks that had previously been issued on &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot;, two of the other three songs, would not make their Capitol Records LP debut until 1980, on the US version of &quot;Rarities&quot;. The other &quot;Introducing...&quot; song was &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, first released in the UK on the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; LP. The song appeared in the US on both the Vee-Jay album as well as Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Meet The Beatles!&quot; LP. These two albums marked the only time that two different Beatles&#x27; albums, each from a different record label, were released in the same month with one song appearing on both albums. There is a difference between the two tracks in that Paul&#x27;s count-off is cut short on the Vee-Jay release by three numbers leaving only &quot;four!&quot; on the intro. Later, in the summer of 1964, Capitol would release &quot;Something New&quot; in the United States with five songs that had already appeared on the American &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; soundtrack album released by United Artists Records about one month earlier.

&quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; has never been officially released on compact disc, although several unauthorized CD reproductions have circulated in both mono and stereo versions, mostly with the version two line-up (with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;).

==Counterfeits==

Starting in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1990s, &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; was frequently counterfeited. These counterfeits can be identified by the cover printing and quality, the label, or the sound quality.

Counterfeits have some significant differences from the commercial issue. Some of the more common variations include:
*Labels with the title of the album and the group&#x27;s name separated by the center spindle hole (as shown in the photo to the right)
*Labels with color bands that are off-center and/or missing the color green (as shown in the photo to the right)
*Labels with large white &quot;brackets&quot; (no color band)
*Album covers with dark brown borders
*Dating from the late 1970s, George Harrison&#x27;s shadow is not visible on the right side of the cover. (However, all legitimate copies of the album and even most counterfeits include his shadow.)
*Hype stickers that read &quot;Featuring Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; (Legitimate hype stickers show &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Please, Please Me&quot;)

Nearly all fakes claim to be in stereo (though the actual sound of the record is often in mono). As legitimate stereo copies of &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; are rare, the majority of copies with &quot;stereo&quot; or &quot;stereophonic&quot; printed on the cover are counterfeits.

There are also known fake versions of &quot;Songs, Pictures, and Stories of the Fabulous Beatles&quot;. These counterfeits often omit &quot;Stories&quot; from the album title, since they are circulated without the gatefold cover and the text inside, renaming it &quot;Songs and Pictures of the Fabulous Beatles&quot;. These versions have three songs not on the original album. &quot;From Me To You&quot; (in place of &quot;Anna&quot;), &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (in place of &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;) and &quot;P.S I Love You&quot;, which opens side 2 rather than &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (The song is rather placed on side 1, track 3).

<text>Albert IV of Austria (19 September 1377 – 14 September 1404) was a Duke of Austria.

== Biography ==
He was born in Vienna, the son of Albert III of Austria and Beatrix of Nuremberg. He was the Duke of Austria from 1395 until 1404, which then included roughly today&#x27;s Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria, as the other Habsburg dominions were at that time ruled by his relatives of the Leopoldinian Line of the family. Albert&#x27;s rule was characterized by quarrels with that part of his family and with members of the Luxemburg dynasty, Wenceslaus and Sigismund.

Albert died at Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, in 1404. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom in Vienna. He was succeeded by his son Albert. Through his maternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Meissen, Albert IV descended from Babenberg dukes of Austria.

==Family and children==
He was married in Vienna 24 April 1390 to Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht I, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing and Margarete of Brieg. Their children were:
# Margarete (26 June 1395, Vienna–24 December 1447), married in Landshut 25 November 1412 to Duke Henry XVI of Bavaria.
# Albert V (16 August 1397–27 October 1439, Neszmély, Hungary).

<doc id="1163339" wikidata="Q7119010" url="?curid=1163339" title="PERF 558">
<text>PERF 558 is the oldest surviving Arabic papyrus, found in Heracleopolis in Egypt, and is also the oldest dated Arabic text using the Islamic era, dating to 643. It is a bilingual Arabic-Greek fragment, consisting of a tax receipt, or as it puts it &quot;Document concerning the delivery of sheep to the Magarites and other people who arrived, as a down-payment of the taxes of the first indiction.&quot;

After excavation, the papyrus was collected by Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria, who donated it to the Austrian National Library in 1899. The museum authority put it in the Erzherzog Rainer Papyrus Collection. This text was published in 1932 by Adolf Grohmann and in 2009 by Demiri and Römer.

==Features==
* The first well-attested use of the disambiguating dots that would become an essential feature of the Arabic alphabet;
* It begins with the Greek formula &quot;ev onomati tou teou&quot; (In the Name of God) after a Sign of the Cross
* It records the date both in the Islamic calendar (an unspecified day in the month Jumada I, year 22) and in the Coptic calendar (30 Parmouti, 1st indiction), corresponding with 25 April 643 in the Julian calendar.
* In Greek, it calls the Arabs &quot;Magaritae&quot;, a term, believed to be related to the Arabic &quot;muhajir&quot; often used in the earliest non-Islamic sources. It also calls them &quot;Saracens&quot;.

==Text==
Dots and hamzas added; otherwise, spelling uncorrected.

# [In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what ʿAbdilah,]
# [Son of Jabir, and his companions-in-arms, have taken as of slaughter sheep at Heracleopolis (Ihnas)]
# [from a representative of Theodorakios (Tidraq), second son of Apa Kyros (Abu Qir), and from a substitute of Christophoros (Istufur), eldest son of Apa Kyros (Abu Qir), fifty sheep]
# [as of slaughter and fifteen other sheep. He gave them for slaughter for the crew of his vessels, as well as his cavalry and his breastplated infantry in]
# [the month of Jumada al-Ula in the year twenty-two. Written by Ibn Hadidu.]

==Historical interest==
This papyrus makes it possible to document the concomitant existence of two states of the Arabic language. Indeed, the name Abu Qir, which does not correspond to classical Arabic. This name is the Arabization of a Greek name Apa Kyros. For Pierre Larcher, it is not the trace of an old style which evolves towards a new &quot;neo-Arabic&quot; form but, conversely, the trace of the linguistic policy of Abd al-Malik which makes Arabic the official language, tries to homogenize the Koranic ductus and classicizes and promotes the old Arabic type. It is only later that Ibn Abu Qir will appear as a fault.

<text>ORP &quot;Grom&quot; is an &quot;Orkan&quot;-class fast attack craft. It is the sister ship of &quot;Orkan&quot; and &quot;Piorun&quot;.

The ship was the result of a construction project undertaken by the German Democratic Republic for its navy, named &quot;Project 660&quot; (&quot;Sassnitz class&quot; in NATO code). After the unification of Germany the unfinished hulls were bought by the Polish Navy from VEB Peenewerft shipyard in Wolgast and completed in Northern Shipyard in Gdańsk.

After its completion in 1995 the ship was incorporated into the 31st Rocket Warships Squadron, 3rd Ship Flotilla.

<text>The Universities Admission Index (UAI) was used in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, as the primary criterion for entry into most undergraduate-entry university programs. It was a number between 0 and 100 (though those below 30 were not reported), occurring in increments of 0.05 and indicating the rounded percentile rank of a student who undertook the Higher School Certificate or ACT Year 12 Certificate with a valid quantity and combination of units of study. It was replaced in N.S.W with the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) in 2009. Prior to the UAI the ACT used its own Tertiary Entrance Rank

==Overview==
The UAI was awarded to students on the completion of the HSC in NSW and the completion of an ACT Year 12 Certificate with a &quot;Tertiary Package&quot; in the ACT — both at the end of year 12. It provided a percentile ranking of peer students of the same age. In NSW, the UAI was determined by a combination of the public HSC exams common across all schools at the end of Year 12 and continuing assessment. Assignments and exams in Year 11 served to prepare students for Year 12 but were not in any way involved in the calculation process. In the ACT, the UAI was determined by ongoing assignments and exams spanning through both Years 11 &amp; 12. The ACT Scaling Test (AST), sat by tertiary students, linked a student&#x27;s ability with the school&#x27;s mean score in each course and was used to scale students in different courses and schools.

UAI scores were not directly equivalent to a percentile rank among those who completed Year 12 (i.e. a UAI of 99 was not equivalent to placing in the top 1% of the state). The statistical distribution of UAI scores in 2004 found that 1.6% of students who completed Year 12 scored at or over a UAI of 99. UAIs are awarded in increments of 0.05. The UAI&#x27;s predecessor, the Tertiary Entrance Rank, was different because it defined the student population as only students in year 12. The UAI attempted to rank students who did not progress to their senior years of High School, by estimating what they would have got. This keeps the rank consistent throughout the years despite fluctuating Year 10 drop-out rates as the rank was always measured relative to a Year 10 cohort, with the ranks of the drop-outs being estimated.

A student&#x27;s UAI was given as a number between 30 and 100. Students who receive 30 or below receive a &#x27;pink slip&#x27; which informed them that they received below 30, though these were rare due to most of the estimated Year 10 cohort&#x27;s marks falling into this range. UAIs of 100 were extremely rare and were only achieved by a few students (generally, about 20 out of almost 66,000) every year.

The organisation responsible for administering the UAI, was the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC), who scaled all subjects using mathematical formulae to try to ensure equity of marks across subjects.

==Calculation in NSW==

To calculate the UAI, the UAC used the raw exam marks of the HSC and the moderated assessment mark.

The assessment mark was obtained from the internal school examinations a student sat over the last term of Year 11 and the three terms of Year 12. The school marks were sent to the UAC from the Board of Studies, and from these students were ranked from first to last. The student ranked first was then assigned a moderated assessment mark equal to the highest examination mark scored by that group of students, regardless of who scored it, and similarly the student ranked last would receive the lowest examination mark. The rest of the students had their assessment marks moderated between these two values, with the proportional difference between the marks remaining the same (for instance, the gap of 10 between two marks spread over a range of 20% would be halved if the range was further halved to 10%).

The student who came first in the subject was then assigned the maximum mark, normally 50.0 on a one unit basis but may have changed with scaling. Following that all students who sat the course had a scaled mark calculated based on an estimate of what each student would have achieved had they sat that course. This was repeated for all of a student&#x27;s units.

The student&#x27;s two best English units were added along with their next best eight units, which may have included further English units, to give an aggregate mark, out of 500.0. Students were then ranked - however, this rank did not translate directly to the UAI. The distribution of students was uneven. Ranking scaled upwards - only 29.3% of students would receive a UAI of under 50, and the median UAI was around 65, a statistical trend which was applicable at every UAI level. This was because the spread of marks took into account those who did not complete their HSC or otherwise attend the post-compulsory years of education. Their hypothetical marks were determined by the School Certificate, one compulsory for all students in NSW. As their marks were generally lower than those who complete the HSC, they caused the uneven spread across the spectrum of the UAI. Hypothetically, assuming that everyone continued to complete the HSC, the spread would have been completely even. However, NSW retention rates for students stood at around 70%, and there were students who completed the final years without gaining an HSC.

==Students who finish high school overseas==
Students who finished high school overseas and who had a qualification such as the SAT, International Baccalaureate or A Levels may have had their score converted to a UAI. Also, a number of international schools had adopted the ACT curriculum and assessment regime such that their studies culminated in the award of an ACT-calculated UAI.

==Australian Tertiary Admission Rank==
During June 2009, the Federal Minister for Education announced the removal of UAI and the introduction of the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, or ATAR, for Year 12 students of 2009 within the ACT and New South Wales, and for the rest of the country excluding Queensland in 2010. The ATAR was introduced as an attempt to unify the university entrance system in Australia, where previously each state had its own individual system (e.g. UAI in ACT/NSW, TER in SA/NT, ENTER in Victoria). The shift to ATAR means that the scores for most students receiving a UAI would increase by a small amount (although this would not present as any advantage as score cutoffs would subsequently increase), while the maximum score would change from a UAI of 100 to an ATAR of 99.95. Queensland will not shift to the ATAR system, due to a completely separate system and scoring scale.

<text>Boondocks Road (formerly Jap Road) is a 4.3-mile (6.9-kilometer) road in Fannett, Texas.

==History==
In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrant Yoshio Mayumi and his brother Yasuo settled in Fannett, purchasing 1734 acres (7 km2) of land. The two brought with them techniques for rice farming, which became the dominant agricultural activity of Jefferson County.

According to local tradition, in 1905 area residents collaborated to build a road to the Mayumi farm, and named the road &quot;Jap Road&quot; in their honor.

In 1924, Mayumi returned to Japan. Low rice prices and smaller harvests due to mismanaged land had rendered his farm unprofitable. The Immigration Act of 1924 and related anti-immigrant sentiment are also considered contributing factors to Mayumi&#x27;s decision to leave the country.

==Controversy==
Although Jap Road was named to honor its Japanese residents, by the end of the 20th century its name had taken on a new meaning. During World War II, &quot;Jap&quot; went from being an abbreviation for &quot;Japanese&quot; to an ethnic slur.

In 1993, advocacy groups, led by Beaumont teacher Sandra Nakata, began pressuring the Jefferson County commissioners to change the name. The county commissioners responded by stating that &quot;Jap Road&quot; was not an ethnic slur and honored the road&#x27;s original Japanese residents. They did, however, give the road&#x27;s residents the chance to change the name if they so chose. Area residents, including descendants of the Japanese settlers, were highly resistant to any name change. Further efforts in 1999 also met with no success.

In 2004, the Japanese American Citizens League and the Anti-Defamation League filed complaints with the US Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Finally bowing to outside pressure, the Jefferson County commissioners ordered Jap Road&#x27;s residents to select a new name by July 29, 2004. They chose opposition leaders Wayne Wright and Earl Callahan to oversee the selection.

The options presented to the road&#x27;s residents included &quot;Mayumi Road&#x27;, &quot;Japanese Road&quot;, &quot;Japan Road&quot;, and &quot;Boondocks Road&quot;. Out of 170 voting residents, over 100 chose &quot;Boondocks Road&quot;. The Boondocks was a popular catfish restaurant that had closed a decade earlier. Anger at outside groups characterizing them as racists is the common explanation for residents&#x27; decision to entirely avoid using any of the Japanese-related names.

<doc id="1163364" wikidata="Q3714722" url="?curid=1163364" title="Then Came Bronson">
<text>Then Came Bronson is an American adventure/drama television series starring Michael Parks that aired on NBC. It was created by Denne Bart Petitclerc, and produced by MGM Television. &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; began with a television film pilot that aired on NBC on March 24, 1969; the pilot was also released in Europe as a theatrical feature film. This was followed by a single season of 26 episodes airing between September 17, 1969, and April 1, 1970.

== Overview ==
The series features Parks as the protagonist, James &quot;Jim&quot; Bronson, a newspaperman who becomes disillusioned after the suicide of his best friend Nick (Martin Sheen), and with &quot;working for The Man&quot; after a heated argument with his editor.

In order to renew his soul, Bronson becomes a vagabond searching for the meaning of life and seeking experiences that life has to offer (as revealed in the series pilot). During his travels, he shares his values with the people he meets along the way and to whom he lends a helping hand when possible. Bronson rides a Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle and, as such, he was viewed by some as a modern version of the solitary cowboy wandering the American west. The motorcycle had previously been sold to Nick by Bronson. After it is left at the scene of the suicide by his friend, Bronson buys it back from the widow.

Though the opening promises a journey of self-discovery, the premise of each episode is that Bronson enters someone else&#x27;s life at a crucial point and acts as a catalyst for change. When Bronson encounters an Amish community, for example, a local boy becomes enraptured by the outside world and steals Bronson&#x27;s motorcycle to run off to Reno, Nevada. In another episode, located in Reno, Nevada, Bronson meets his cousin Eve on her wedding day and lends her money for the wedding service, but she runs off to the casinos and gambles it away.

The first three episodes, including the end credits scenes, were shot in and around Jackson, Wyoming. The pilot film was also shown at the town&#x27;s (then) only theater to give the locals a sense of what the series was going to be about, since they were shooting in town and at popular local area locations.

Bronson is committed to pacifism and often redirects an antagonist&#x27;s anger into self-examination. Always, like a true catalyst, Bronson rolls out of every episode unchanged.

The show had obvious similarities to the early 1960s series &quot;Route 66&quot;; Michael Parks guest-starred in one episode of that series. It was also sometimes erroneously described as a knock-off of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The airing of the 2-hour &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; pilot film preceded the first public showing of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival) by about two months.

=== Series opening ===
The opening of the show served as a metaphor for the premise of the show: getting away from the &quot;big city&quot; and leading a simpler life. The opening begins with Bronson riding up to a red light in San Francisco and he briefly chats with a commuter. The scene also introduces Bronson&#x27;s signature-phrase, which he often used in the episodes, &quot;Hang in there&quot;.

:Driver: &quot;Taking a trip?&quot;
:Bronson: &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;
:Driver: &quot;Taking a trip?&quot;
:Bronson: &quot;Yeah.&quot;
:Driver: &quot;Where to?&quot;
:Bronson: &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know. Wherever I end up, I guess.&quot;
:Driver: &quot;Man, I wish I was you.&quot;
:Bronson: &quot;Really?&quot;
:Driver: &quot;Yeah.&quot;
:Bronson: &quot;Well, hang in there.&quot;

From here he heads out to California&#x27;s State Route 1 and then crosses over the Bixby Creek Bridge.

== Cast ==
Michael Parks, who starred as James Bronson, had acted on television and starred in three anti-establishment films, &quot;Wild Seed&quot;, &quot;The Happening&quot;, and &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town.&quot; He went on to have a steady career in drive-in horror movies and TV shows. Also a talented singer, Parks recorded three pop/jazz albums: &quot;Long Lonesome Highway&quot;, &quot;Closing the Gap&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and several gospel albums. &quot;Long Lonesome Highway&quot; and &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; were connected with particular strength to &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;. Parks performed the former&#x27;s title selection over the closing credits of each episode, and it and the latter both featured other music from the series. (See below.)

=== Guest stars ===
Actors James Doohan (&quot;Scotty&quot;) and Meg Wyllie, who appeared in guest roles, had previously worked on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

== Production ==
The series was filmed and broadcast in color.

=== The motorcycle ===
Bronson&#x27;s motorcycle, a 1969 XLH 900cc Harley-Davidson Sportster, figures in many episodes. In one episode he enters several motorcycle races; in another, he makes an emergency run to fetch a doctor, but in some stories, the motorcycle serves merely as his transportation.

The fuel tank is illustrated with the Eye of Providence.

=== Crew ===
Several of &quot;Bronson&quot;″s production staff and cast members had previously worked on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, including executive producer Herbert F. Solow and producer Robert H. Justman, and writers D. C. Fontana and Robert Sabaroff.

The series is also notable for providing the first television script credit for writer-producer Susan Harris, who went on to create &quot;Soap&quot; and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

=== Music ===
The opening instrumental theme song was titled &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; and was composed and conducted by George Duning. The closing vocal theme for the series, titled &quot;Long Lonesome Highway&quot;, was sung by Parks and written and composed by James Hendricks; it was a &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; Hot 100 hit that reached #20 in 1970.

On March 25, 1970, Parks guest-starred on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; S1E25. Cash riding Bronson&#x27;s Harley-Davidson introduces Parks as Bronson, saying, &quot;And then Bronson came back to Tennessee&quot;. Parks sang his hit song from the show and then he and Johnny did a duet of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma Hills&quot;.

Parks released two albums on the MGM label that featured music from this series, &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; (1969), and &quot;Long Lonesome Highway&quot; (1970). In addition, other artists such as John Bahler, Kiel Martin, Gary Jayson, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and Tom Paxton sang songs that appeared in the series. Actress Bonnie Bedelia in the pilot sang gospel song &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; with Parks.

A version of &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot;, sung by Parks, appears on the Rhino CD &quot;Golden Throats 3: Sweethearts of Rodeo Drive&quot;.

In 2010, Duning&#x27;s score for the pilot and two episode scores by Gil Mellé were released as part of Film Score Monthly&#x27;s &quot;TV Omnibus: Volume One (1962–1976)&quot;. In 2013 Intrada Records released a two-disc set of music from the series, featuring Duning&#x27;s six episode scores on disc one and selections from the other scores on disc two by John Parker, Elliot Kaplan, Stu Phillips, Dean Elliott, Richard Shores, Tom McIntosh, and Philip Springer.

== Episodes ==
== Home media ==
The pilot telefilm was made available on DVD as a part of the Warner Archives collection from Warner Bros. on November 17, 2009.

== Awards ==
* Episode #10, &quot;Two Percent of Nothing&quot; (guest-starring Steve Ihnat and Pat Quinn) written by D. C. Fontana], was nominated for the Writers Guild Award.

== Other media ==
Three tie-in novels with original stories were published during the show&#x27;s run: &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; by William Johnston, and &quot;Then Came Bronson #2: The Ticket&quot; and &quot;Then Came Bronson #3: Rock!&quot; by Chris Stratton.

MPC released a model kit &quot;Bronson Motorcycle Custom Harley-Davidson Sportster&quot; in 1970 in 1/8 Scale.

== In popular culture ==
The series was parodied by Pat Paulsen in a running sketch, &quot;Then Came Paulsen&quot;, on &quot;Pat Paulsen&#x27;s Half a Comedy Hour&quot;. Paulsen&#x27;s motorcycle had training wheels.

The series was also satirized by &quot;Mad&quot; magazine in a piece titled &quot;Then Came Bombsome&quot;, which portrayed Parks smoking atop his Harley in the iconic opening scene at the San Francisco stoplight: &quot;Takin&#x27; a trip&quot;? &quot;No, this is a regular cigarette I&#x27;m smoking.&quot;

&quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; has also been referenced numerous times on the film-mocking TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, usually in a scene featuring a lone figure riding on a motorcycle. MST3K writer Frank Conniff, who portrayed TV&#x27;s Frank, is said to be a big fan of the short-lived series.

<text>Rio Grande (Portuguese for &quot;great river&quot;) is a river in south-central Brazil. It rises in the Mantiqueira Mountains in the state of Minas Gerais and descends inland, west-northwestward. Its lower course marks a portion of the Minas Gerais-São Paulo border. At the Mato Grosso do Sul state border, after a course of , it joins the Paranaíba River to form the Upper Paraná River.

Major tributaries of the Rio Grande are:
* Rio Aiuruoca, whose source is in Itamonte;
* Rio das Mortes, whose source lies between Barbacena and Senhora dos Remédios;
* Rio Jacaré, whose source is in the Serra do Galba;
* Rio Sapucaí, whose source is in the Mantiqueira Mountains in São Paulo;
* Rio Pardo, whose source is in Ipuiúna.

The basin of the Rio Grande belongs to the Paraná River basin. The basin has a total area of , of which are located within Minas Gerais, which is equivalent to 17.8% of the state territory. The basin of the Rio Grande is responsible for about 67% of all energy generated in the state.

The Grande is interrupted by several dams and reservoirs; in the upper Grande the river forms Furnas Dam, then Peixotos Dam, and downstream, Luiz Barreto Dam, Jaguara Dam, Volta Grande Dam, Marimbondo Dam and Água Vermelha Dam.

The river plays a major role in production of electricity and, due to rapids and waterfalls, and absence of locks, is only navigable by small craft in limited stretches. However the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas (a narrow gauge railway) operated a passenger and freight steam navigation service between 1889 and 1963. The EFOM met the Rio Grande at Ribeirão Vermelho, from where the service ran down the river for , as far as Capetina. There were six stations on the river between Ribeirão Vermelho and Capetinga, and the railway operated a fleet of 6 stern-wheel paddle steamers, together with barges and launches. The service was halted by the completion of the Furnas Dam.

<doc id="1163376" wikidata="Q267510" url="?curid=1163376" title="Faust, Part Two">
<text>Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy () is the second part of the tragic play &quot;Faust&quot; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It was published in 1832, the year of Goethe&#x27;s death.

Only part of &quot;Faust I&quot; is directly related to the legend of Johann Faust, which dates to at latest the beginning of the 16th century (thus preceding Marlowe&#x27;s play). The &quot;Gretchen&quot; subplot, although now the most widely known episode of the Faust legend, was of Goethe&#x27;s own invention. In &quot;Faust II&quot;, the legend (at least in a version of the 18th century, which came to Goethe&#x27;s attention) already contained Faust&#x27;s marriage with Helen and an encounter with an Emperor. But certainly Goethe deals with the legendary material very freely in both parts.

==Background==

Goethe had been writing &quot;Faust&quot; since 1771/1772, and he had kept working on it all the way to his death (1832), working for about 60 years on the play. Goethe, like Christopher Marlowe, used the &quot;Volksbuch&quot; (folk book, most likely in the version by Pfitzer) to gather inspiration for his Faust. (Goethe didn&#x27;t read Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; until 1818, the same year he began working again on the second part of his play.) In 1831, Goethe concluded the play, adding the final scene of the fifth act. Right after finishing the play, Goethe sealed the manuscript and locked it in a drawer in his office; yet, he was tempted to work again on the play, and he pulled out the manuscript for a private reading to Ottilie von Goethe and Johann Peter Eckermann, revising some minor details. After Goethe&#x27;s death (on March 22, 1832), the second part of the play was published by Eckermann and Friedrich Wilhelm Riemer in the first volume of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Nachgelassene Werke&quot; (&quot;Posthumous Works&quot;).

==Acts==
===Act I===
* &quot;Graceful area. Faust, bedded on flowery turf, weary, restless, seeking sleep. Dusk. Ghost circle, floating moves, graceful little figures.&quot;

The first act opens with an appeal by Ariel to forgive Faust and ease the cares of his suffering.

* &quot;Hall of the Throne. State Council in anticipation of the emperor. Trumpets. Servants of all kinds, beautifully dressed, step forward. The emperor ascends the throne, to his right the astrologer.&quot;

The first act sees Mephistopheles (playing the role of a fool) saving the imperial finances of the Emperor – and so the Holy Roman Empire – by money creation, introducing the use of paper money instead of gold to encourage spending (and economic recovery).

* &quot;Spacious room with side chambers, decorated and dressed up for the masquerade.&quot;

This is by far the most extensive section of the first act, describing the Florentine carnival from the perspective of Goethe, above all based on Antonio Francesco Grazzini&#x27;s &quot;Tutti i trionfi&quot; (1559) – a collection of contemporary &quot;songs and hard lifts&quot;. A parade of Florentine notables, including Dante and Gianni Schicchi, pass by.

* &quot;Lustgarten, morning sun. Faust, Mephistopheles, decent, not remarkable, according to custom, dressed, and both knees exposed.&quot;

The &quot;Emperor of Thumb&quot; (to use a devilish term of Mephistopheles) describes how much he enjoyed the recent celebrations, and wants more &quot;dergleichen Scherze&quot; (5988). The Emperor appears and blesses the newly introduced paper money from Mephisto, which is adorned with pictures of Simon Magus. The Emperor begins to understand its meaning and to squander it, as do his advisors. Goethe here satirizes the introduction of paper money during the French Revolution, with various advisors possibly representing Danton, Sieyès and other figures.

* &quot;Dark gallery. Faust. Mephistopheles.&quot;

Faust enters the &quot;realm of the mothers&quot; – variously described as the depths of the psyche or the womb – in order to bring back the &quot;ideal form&quot; of beauty for the Emperor&#x27;s delight. In this case, the ideal forms are Helen of Troy and her lover Paris. Faust summons their spirits from Hades, but the emperor and the male members of his court criticize Paris&#x27;s appearance, while the women of the court criticize Helen&#x27;s appearance. Faust falls in love with Helen. In a fit of jealously toward Paris, who is now abducting Helen, Faust destroys the illusion and the act ends in darkness and tumult.

===Act II===

Mephistopheles transports the unconscious Faust into his old study. Mephistopheles, donning Faust&#x27;s robe once again, resumes his conversation with the freshman, who is now a cynical baccalaureus. The Homunculus, an artificial human being created by Wagner, Faust&#x27;s former famulus, by means of an alchemical process, leads Faust and Mephistopheles to the &quot;Classical Walpurgisnacht&quot;, where they encounter gods and monsters from Greek antiquity. Faust, still searching for Helen, is led by the sybil Manto into the Underworld. Mephistopheles, meanwhile, meets the Phorkyads or Phorcydes (another name for the Graeae), three hideous hags who share one tooth and one eye between them, and he disguises himself as one of them. Guided by the sea-god Proteus, the Homunculus is initiated into the process of becoming fully human, but his glass flask shatters, and he dies.

===Act III===
The third act begins with Helen&#x27;s arrival at the palace of Menelaus in Sparta, accompanied by women, who, as in Classical drama, constitute the chorus. The hideous Phorkyas appears at the hearth, and warns Helen that Menelaus means to sacrifice her and her attendants. Distraught at this new knowledge, Helen implores Phorkyas to save them. Phorkyas transports Helen and the chorus to Faust&#x27;s fortress, where Helen and Faust declare their love for each other. After defeating Menelaus&#x27; army, Faust proclaims the pastoral beauty of the Arcadian countryside.

The scene changes in time and space: a range of rocky caverns, with a shadowy grove extending to the foot of the rocks. Phorkyas, now Faust and Helen&#x27;s attendant, explains to the newly-woken chorus that during the past interval Faust and Helen have had a spirited son named Euphorion, who charms all with his beauty and gift for music. The wild Euphorion, becoming increasingly bold in his flight, falls to his death (in allusion to Icarus), whereupon the sorrowful Helen disappears in a mist to Hades (in allusion to the legend of Orpheus). The chorus of women, undesirous of joining their mistress in the Underworld, revert to nature, which they extol in songs of praise. As the act ends, Phorkyas is revealed to be Mephistopheles in disguise.

===Act IV===
In the fourth act, Faust finds himself taken away from Arcadia to a mountain top in Germany. Watching a cloud, that is separating into two parts, he recognizes in one part Helen and in the other Gretchen. The cloud with the form of Helen moves eastward, while the cloud of Gretchen rises heavenward. Then Mephistopheles, who has left behind his Greek appearance, joins Faust again. Mephistopheles strikes up a geognostic dispute about the genesis of terrestrial surface and especially the mountain region of this scene. Thereafter Faust states as his new higher purpose, that he wants to reclaim new land. Behind his desire stands the idea to control the elements or even to subdue nature. Subsequently, Faust focuses on controlling the sea, from which he reclaims new ground by dams and drainage ditches. But a war breaks out between the Emperor and a rival Emperor, whereby Faust&#x27;s plans are interrupted. Mephistopheles introduces the three mighty men (German: ) consisting of Bullyboy, Grab-quick and Hold-tight (&quot;Raufebold&quot;, &quot;Habebald&quot;, &quot;Haltefest&quot;), that should help to oppress the revolt and implement Faust&#x27;s ambitious project. With the assistance of the three mighty men Faust achieves the victory for the Emperor. The three mighty men reveal dubious behaviours as looters, that cast a long shadow over their future services. As a reward for his military service Faust gets a district at the beach to administer.

===Act V===
An indefinite interval of time has passed since the end of the previous act, and Faust is now an old but powerful man favored by the king. Using dikes and dams to push back the sea, Faust has built a castle on the reclaimed land. Upon seeing the hut of an old peasant couple (Baucis and Philemon) and a nearby chapel, Faust becomes irritated that these two structures do not belong to him, and orders to have them removed. Mephistopheles overinterprets Faust&#x27;s orders by murdering the old couple. The personification of Care breathes upon Faust&#x27;s eyes, and he becomes blind. Upon disclosing his plans to better the lives of his subjects, motivated perhaps out of guilt, he recognizes the moment of sheer bliss which he would seek to prolong and drops dead. Mephistopheles believes Faust has lost his wager and tries to claim his soul. Angels suddenly appear, dropping rose-petals on the demons, who flee from the burning petals. While Mephistopheles had won his wager with Faust, Mephistopheles had lost his wager with God, made in the Prologue to Part I, that man could be swayed from righteous pursuits. Mephistopheles stands his ground, however, and under the aphrodisiac influence of the roses, lusts after the angels, who meanwhile make off with Faust&#x27;s soul.

The scene abruptly changes to a wilderness inhabited by holy anchorites: &quot;Mountain-gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert&quot;. &quot;Pater Profundus&quot; discloses the parable of nature, which is a harbinger of divine love. The angels bearing Faust&#x27;s soul appear in heaven. After the enraptured Doctor Marianus extols the Eternal Feminine, the virgin Mary, &quot;Mater Gloriosa&quot;, appears from on high. Three biblical holy women, &quot;Magna Peccatrix&quot; (the Great Sinneress, Luke 7:36), &quot;Mulier Samaritana&quot; (the Samaritan woman, John 4), and &quot;Maria Aegyptiaca&quot; (&quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;), plead for Faust&#x27;s soul, while &quot;Una Poenitentium&quot; (previously Gretchen), also pleading for grace, offers to lead the reborn Faust into the higher spheres of heaven. &quot;Mater Gloriosa&quot; grants her wish.

The &quot;Chorus Mysticus&quot; ends the drama:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;All of the transient,
Is parable, only:
The insufficient,
Here, grows to reality:
The indescribable,
Here, is done:
Woman, eternal [&quot;Ewig-Weibliche&quot;, &quot;the eternal female&quot;],
Beckons us on.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Ancient parallels===
The final words are spoken by a &quot;Chorus Mysticus&quot;, i.e. a chorus related to the mysteries, which alludes to an &quot;indescribable&quot; process in which &quot;the eternal feminine leads us on&quot;. This resembles ancient mystery religions, and particularly the mysteries of Isis, more than it does orthodox Christian mysticism. In ancient rites of initiation into the mysteries of the goddess Isis, the initiate was guided by a nonverbal process called the &quot;&quot;. The last words of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust Part II&quot; call to mind the &quot;epopteia&quot;, which is a nonverbal and indescribable process, associated with the sense of sight. 

Similarly, a few lines earlier, Faust petitions the angels for a vision of the &quot;Queen of heaven&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Mightiest empress of the world,
Let me, in the blue
Pavilion of the sky unfurl&#x27;d,
Thy mystery view!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Höchste Herrscherin der Welt!
Lasse mich, im blauen,
Ausgespannten Himmelszelt
Dein Geheimniß schauen. (11997–12000)&lt;/poem&gt; Likewise in his final words, Faust prays to the Mater Gloriosa using the titles &quot;Virgin, Mother, Queen&quot; (11995) and also &quot;Goddess&quot; (12100). This goes beyond orthodox Christian teaching, for although &quot;Queen of heaven&quot; is a Christian title of the Virgin Mary, Christian churches balk at calling her &quot;Goddess&quot;, which would imply polytheism. 

However, in the mysteries of Isis, a goddess was indeed invoked by the title &quot;Queen of heaven&quot; -- as witnessed by Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, an important source for the modern understanding of ancient mystery religions. The protagonist of the &quot;Golden Ass&quot; begins his prayer to the &quot;Goddess&quot; by calling her &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;. 

Apuleius also calls Isis &quot;mother of all Nature ... whose sole divinity is worshipped in differing forms, with varying rites, under many names, by all the world.&quot; Goethe echoes this motif of the archetypal &quot;mother of Nature&quot;, for instance at the beginning of &quot;Faust Part I&quot;, Doctor Faust refers to Nature as a &quot;veiled goddess&quot;, in explicit reference to the ancient veiled Isis, who was also identified as goddess and mother of nature:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Mysterious, even in broad daylight,
Nature won&#x27;t let her veil be raised:
What your spirit can&#x27;t bring to sight,
Won&#x27;t by screws and levers be displayed.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Geheimnißvoll am lichten Tag
Läßt sich Natur des Schleyers nicht berauben,
Und was sie deinem Geist nicht offenbaren mag,
Das zwingst du ihr nicht ab mit Hebeln und mit Schrauben. (672–675)&lt;/poem&gt;

== Goethe&#x27;s statements about &quot;Faust II&quot; ==
In the context of Act III:

I never doubted that the readers for whom I effectively wrote would grasp the principal significance of the portrayal straight away. It is time that the impassioned dispute between classicists and romantics should finally be reconciled. The principal thing is that we should properly cultivate ourselves; the source from which we do so would not matter, if we did not have to fear the possibility of miscultivation by appealing to false models. For it is certainly a broader and purer insight into and around Greek and Roman literature to which we owe our liberation from the monkish barbarism of the period between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Is it not from this high level that we can learn to appreciate everything in its true physical and aesthetic value, both what is oldest and what is newest?

– Goethe&#x27;s letter to K. J. L. Iken September 27, 1827 (translation of Rüdiger Bubner)

Rather in the context of Act III:

&quot;Yet, ... it all appeals to the senses, and on the stage would satisfy the eye: more I did not intend. Let the crowd of spectators take pleasure in the spectacle; the higher import will not escape the initiated, as has been the case with the &#x27;Magic Flute&#x27;, and other things beside.&quot;

– &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; by Johann Peter Eckermann January 25, 1827 (translated by John Oxenford)

In the context of Act IV &quot;The Mothers! Mothers! nay, it sounds so strange.&quot; (6216–6217):

&quot;I can reveal to you no more [...] except that I found, in Plutarch, that in ancient Greece mention was made of the Mothers as divinities. This is all that I owe to others, the rest is my own invention. Take the manuscript home with you, study it carefully, and see what you can make of it.&quot;

– &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; by Johann Peter Eckermann January 10, 1830 (translated by John Oxenford)

&quot;But, in the second part, there is scarcely anything of the subjective; here is seen a higher, broader, clearer, more passionless world, and he who has not looked about him and had some experience, will not know what to make of it.&quot;

– &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; by Johann Peter Eckermann February 17, 1831 (translated by John Oxenford)

<text>Fair Head or Benmore (; The Great Cliff) is a long, high, mountain cliff, close to the sea, at the north-eastern corner of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The cliff&#x27;s sheer and vertical high dolerite rock face is shaped into distinctive vertical columns like organ pipes, which formed 60 million years ago when a sill of igneous rock was injected between horizontal Carboniferous sediments.

Fair Head is considered one of the best traditional climbing and bouldering locations in the British Isles, and is one of the biggest expanses of climbable rock in Northwest Europe. It has one of the largest concentration of extreme-graded routes in the British Isles, and has climbs at E9-grade (e.g. &quot;Rathlin Effect&quot;), as well as highball problems at E9-grade (e.g. &quot;Long runs the Fox&quot;), and bouldering at grade (e.g. &quot;Blondie SDS&quot;).

==Geography==

The headland of Fair Head rises above the sea, and extends for over . The dolerite rock face is over high in places. Wild goats can be seen roaming among the rocks beneath the clifftops, where a walkway called &quot;The Grey Man&#x27;s Path&quot; winds around the rugged coastline. From the road above the cliff, a human-made Iron Age island or crannóg can be seen in the middle of a lake, Lough na Cranagh. The lakes are stocked with trout and can be fished during the summer months. All of the land at Fair Head is private farmland, and not owned by the National Trust (who only have a lease on the land to the east of the headland). Access is by the goodwill of local farm owners. Fair Head is the closest headland to Rathlin Island.

Fair Head&#x27;s rock formations appear on the 2nd century Ptolemy&#x27;s map of Ireland from Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, described as a point called Ῥοβόγδιον (&quot;Rhobogdiun&quot;) (cf the Pictish Robogdii tribe), which academics believe is Fair Head. The name may derive from the Proto-Celtic root *&quot;bogd&quot;, &quot;bend&quot;.

Fair Head (and the neighboring Murlough Bay) are classed as an area of special scientific interest (ASSI), and are on the register of Antrim ASSI.

==Geology==

Fair Head is a sill of Palaeogene age that is the thickest and most extensive of the various sills from the plateau lavas of northeast Ireland. A sill is a tabular body of what was once molten rock that was injected into horizontal rocks (usually well-bedded sedimentary strata). Fair Head&#x27;s sill is thick at its maximum, and consists of columnar-jointed dolerite rock (a medium-grained igneous rock compositionally equivalent to finer-grained basalt) showing crystals of olivine, that intruded into Carboniferous sediments in the north of the outcrop circa 60 million years ago. At the north end of Murlough Bay, a substantial sill (the Binnagapple sill) appears below the main Fair Head sill, separated by of Carboniferous shales.

Despite the thickness, the heat from the Fair Head sill did not alter the underlying Triassic sandstone, however, shales have been converted to hornfels extending up to from the contact. The distinctive columnar jointing of the dolerite rock is the result of stresses caused by the cooling and solidifying of the melt, and there are minor crush zones associated with later compression. Although the cliff face is stable, weathering has periodically toppled some columns producing blocks of massive dimensions on the scree below. Geologists record that even major storms barely disturb these blocks (e.g. unlike the limestone blocks at Ailladie in Clare), and thus the scree may be little changed since the late-glacial period.

==Rock climbing==

===Reputation and ethics===
The 2014 Fair Head guidebook, its 6th edition, lists over 430 routes mostly from grade VS 4b up to E6 6b, and the current climbing databases list over 445 routes at grades up to E9 6c. Fair Head is not regarded as an ideal crag for novice climbers, and the long nature of the routes (averaging over 50 metres, with many up to 100 metres), the requirement for long and intimidating abseils for access in many areas, and the high concentration of E-grade climbs, means that it is ideally a crag for intermediate and even more for expert-level climbers. There have been fatalities at the crag. An annual Fair Head Climbing Meet is held over the first weekend of June for all climbers.

The cliffs abound in well-protected steep crack climbing, between one and four pitches in length, with routes that range from under to over . Many of the cracks involve hand-jamming (and even full-body jamming), and some climbers tape their hands to protect the skin from the &quot;Fair Head rash&quot;. Some routes involve off-width or full-width chimneying, which is not often encountered in other Irish crags. As with all Irish crags, Fair Head is a traditional climbing area with no bolted or sport climbing routes allowed; the Mountaineering Ireland guidebook states that any newly placed manufactured bolts will be removed.

Fair Head is considered one of the best climbing venues in the British Isles, and is compared to Stanage for the scale of routes, particularly at E-grade. Fair Head is noted for the variation in its climbing sections from the westerly-facing sea-cliff walls like the &quot;Rathlin Wall&quot;, to the cold dark mountain-like north faces of &quot;White Lightning Amphitheatre&quot; and &quot;Grey Man&#x27;s Path&quot;, which have been compared to Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu. Climbing author David Flanagan called it &quot;the jewel in the crown of Irish climbing&quot;. &quot;Climbing&quot; ranked &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (E6 6b) in its top-5 E6-grade climbs, and &quot;Born to Run&quot; E4 (6a, 5c, 5c) in its top-5 E4-grade climbs, in the Brish Isles.

===Layout===

Fair Head is one of the largest rock climbing crags in the British Isles, stretching to over 5-kilometers. The individual sections can have a very different feel and character, ranging from dry westerly faces to cold dark northerly faces. The main sectors (and subsectors) are (east to west):
* &quot;Small Crag&quot; is a 10–20m high sector with almost 70 climbs, most of which are at VS to HVS grade, which stretches for 1-kilometre above a forested hillside; the difficulty of access means that abseiling in is recommended. Together with infestations of midges, this makes the sector unpopular, in spite of the quality of climbing. Further east is the small &quot;The Middle Crag&quot; with a handful of 20–25m E1 climbs accessed by abseil from in-situ stakes.

* &quot;Main Crag&quot; is 3-kilometers long, 100m tall, with several sub-sections (see below). While many routes are accessed by long abseil (up to 100m), there are two descent gullies at either end, but 3-kilometres apart, the &quot;Grey Man&#x27;s Path Gully&quot; (east end) and &quot;Ballycastle Descent Gully&quot; (west end).
:* &quot;Binnagapple Area&quot; has 30 routes on clean lichen-free rock (as it absorbs the early-morning sun) but is less frequented as most routes are graded E2 to E4, and it requires a long abseil for access; it has some of the best-regarded multi-pitch E-grade routes, &quot;Toby Jug&quot; (E1 5a, 5b), &quot;Hurricane&quot; (E2 5b, 5b), and &quot;Sandpiper&quot; (E2 5c, 5a), and extremes like &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (E4 6a) and &quot;The Dark Side&quot; (E8 6c).
:* &quot;Grey Man&#x27;s Path&quot; has almost 30 routes but is less popular, despite its easier access via the gully, as the cliff is windy and the rock slow to dry; the section is noted for &quot;Burn Up&quot; (HVS 5a, 5a), described as the &quot;hall of fame HVS of the crag&quot; and which has a dramatic &quot;throne belay&quot;.
:* &quot;White Lightning Amphitheatre&quot; is a vast open bay usually accessed via an 85m abseil, with over 20 routes mostly graded E3 to E4, including &quot;Born to Run&quot; E4 (6a, 5c, 5c), described as &quot;one of the best routes in Ireland&quot;, and ranked in the &quot;5 Best E4-graded routes in the UK&quot;. 
:*&quot;An Bealach Rúnda area&quot; (including &quot;Terraces&quot;) is over 30 routes, some requiring body-jamming and multi-pitch route finding, accessed via a 90m abseil down &quot;An Goban Saor&quot;; &quot;An Bealach Rúnda&quot; (E1 5a, 5b, 5a) is one of the most popular climbs in Fair Head, with &quot;Blockbuster&quot; (E2 5c, 4c, 5b) well regarded, however, most other routes are above the E3-grade, with &quot;An Bealach Eile&quot; at E8 6c.

* &quot;Rathlin Wall&quot; is a 40–100m high west-facing wall with easy access to over 35 single and multi-pitch extreme climbs that include some of the best-regarded E2 (e.g. &quot;Equinox&quot;, &quot;Blind Phew&quot;, &quot;Mizen Star&quot;) to E4 (&quot;Face Value&quot;) and E5 (&quot;The Mask&quot;) graded climbs in Fair Head, as well as some of the most extreme climbs at Fair Head including &quot;Complete Scream&quot; (E8 6b), and &quot;The Big Skin&quot; (E8 6c).
* &quot;Wall of Prey&quot; is a wall between &quot;Rathlin Wall&quot; and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; that contains over 10 climbs the easiest of which is &quot;Wall of Prey&quot; (E5 6b), and which includes &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (E6 6b), ranked in the &quot;5 Best E6-graded climbs in the UK&quot;, &quot;Below and Behold&quot; (E7 6c), and &quot;Rathlin Effect&quot; (E9 6c), the crag&#x27;s first E9.
* &quot;Ballycastle Descent Gully&quot; (East &amp; West) is one of the most popular areas after &quot;The Prow&quot; given the ease of access, westerly aspect, and quality VS and HVS options, with &quot;Aoife&quot; (VS 4b, 4b), &quot;Girona&quot; (VS 4c, 4c), and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (HVS 5a, 5a), some of the most popular climbs in Fair Head.
* &quot;The Prow&quot; is the most popular climbing section in Fair Head – and particularly for first-time visitors to dolerite crack and corner climbing routes – with over 40 easily accessible and mostly west-facing routes that are generally linear single-pitch crack climbs of 20–60m in length, and which include several of Fair Head&#x27;s best-regarded climbs in the VS (e.g. &quot;The Black Thief&quot;, &quot;The Fence&quot;) and E1 (&quot;Midnight Cruiser&quot;, &quot;Railroad&quot; and &quot;Fireball&quot;) range.
* &quot;Farrangandoo crag&quot; is an amphitheatre-shaped sector that has over 30 routes covering a range of lengths (mostly 25–45m) and grades (from VS to E2), with &quot;Pangur Ban&quot; (HVS 5a), and &quot;Crib Pad Crack&quot; (E1 5b) (including the E3 6a &quot;Crib Direct&quot;), being the most popular routes.
* &quot;Marconi&#x27;s Cove&quot; is a small crag about 500m away that gets a lot of afternoon sun, and contains about 30 shorter (by Fair Head standards) 20–25m single-pitch climbs from VS to E3, on more open face climbing, with &quot;Soundman&quot; (E3 5c) and &quot;Distant Voices&quot; (E3 5c) being the most regarded.

===Access===

Fair Head crag is on private property and is part of the McBride family farm, a working farm the McBride family has operated for over three centuries, but access is given. The eastern side of Murlough Bay is part of the National Trust. The McBride&#x27;s &quot;Sean&#x27;s Farm&quot; car park is near to the &quot;Ballycastle Descent Gully&quot; area, while the &quot;National Trust&quot; car park is closer to the &quot;Grey Man&#x27;s Path Gully&quot;. From either car park, it takes about 15 minutes to reach the top of the crag. Fair Head&#x27;s eastern end (the &quot;Small Crag&quot;, and the &quot;Murlough Bay&quot; bouldering area) can be approached from the Murlough Bay car park.

The two main descent options to the base of the crag by foot are the popular &quot;Ballycastle Descent Gully&quot;, and the less popular &quot;Grey Man&#x27;s Path Gully&quot;. Walking along the base of the Fair Head crag for any distance is not recommended as the terrain makes it time-consuming and very unpleasant, and therefore for routes in the middle of the crag that are far from the two descent gullies, a 100m abseil rope is advised (with a knot tied at the end of it for safety); several of the main routes have large boulders or metal stakes as abseil points. Climbers can stay at the crag in &quot;Sean&#x27;s Farm&quot;, where the McBride family offer basic temporary camping and some lodging facilities (including a camping barn) for a fee, while more extensive accommodation, including a hostel, can be found in nearby Ballycastle.

===Climbing history===

The first climbs at Fair Head were done in the mid-1960s by Belfast-based climbers and members of the Dublin-based Spillikin Club. Most of these climbs followed loose and dirty chimneys and are rarely repeated today, however, by the end of the sixties development of the crag had started in earnest. Development slowed during the height of the troubles in the early 1970s, but development picked up again in the late seventies, led by the husband-and-wife team of Calvin Torrans and Clare Sheridan, and a number of other Dublin climbers. This small band devoted themselves to developing Fair Head, founded the Dal Riada Climbing Club (named after the ancient kingdom which included this area), and acquired a climbing hut nearby to accommodate themselves and other visiting climbers.

==Bouldering==
Fair Head also contains over 511 bouldering problems, with a concentration in the boulder fields that have accumulated in &quot;Murlough Bay&quot; area (east side of the crag) and at the base of the &quot;Ballycastle Descent&quot; area (west side). These dolerite boulders have fallen off the cliffs above and the general required style is described as &quot;steep, crimpy and powerful&quot;, with a caution that excess bouldering mats are needed to handle the poor landing areas due to the density of the strewn boulder fields. Rob Hunter, with his wife Veronica, is credited with developing the venue, and their 2012 guidebook listed over 450 routes from grade to .

In 2020, Hunter created the first route by adding a sit-down-start (SDS) to Dan Varian&#x27;s problem, &quot;Blondie&quot;. Classic extreme problems include Varian&#x27;s &quot;Blondie&quot; and &quot;Glen Ross&quot; , which Varian describes as one of his best-ever climbing moments. and also Ricky Bell&#x27;s &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Arete&quot; , and &quot;Spindle SDS&quot; on the distinctive Hanging Rock boulder. Extreme highball bouldering problems include &quot;The Big Black&quot; (E7 6c), and Ricky Bell&#x27;s 2015 free solo of the boulder slab &quot;Long Runs the Fox&quot; (E9 6c) in the &quot;Murlough Bay&quot;.

In 2012, Irish climbing author David Flanagan, ranked Fair Head as one of the best bouldering locations in Ireland, just behind Glendalough in Wicklow. In a 2017 video review for &quot;Rock &amp; Ice&quot; magazine, British boulder Dan Turner called it one of the best locations in the British Isles, and &quot;Britain&#x27;s answer to Magic Wood in Switzerland&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Fair Head is used as a location in Season 7 of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, in Episode 3 &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Justice&quot;, and Episode 5 &quot;Eastwatch&quot;.

<text>The Sidewalk.com website was formerly the location of a Microsoft Corporation local information project. The website is now owned by Ask Media Group.

==History==
Sidewalk.com was first registered in 1995 by a C.D. Bell of Los Angeles, CA, as a website where local subscribers could gain a presence on the web. Bell compiled a lengthy list of possible names for his new domain, and much to his surprise his first choice, &quot;Sidewalk.com&quot;, was available. Most of the website content was rather inconsequential save for the wildly popular &quot;Unofficial O.J. Simpson Boycott Page&quot;.

In 1996 Bell sold the domain to the Microsoft Corporation who, for its purposes, was interested in the domain name only.

1997 saw Microsoft debut the website as a listing of local events and information in numerous cities. It was Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s attempt to create a group of comprehensive web portals oriented towards specific cities. Imbued with hip urban writing and lifestyle articles, the service was intended to compete with urban weekly newspapers. It was preceded by other city-specific net guides such as AOL&#x27;s Digital Cities and Boulevards.

In 1999, Microsoft sold the project to Citysearch. However, in 2007 Steve Ballmer stated that &quot;Sidewalk was really aimed at what we now call local search... Sidewalk is one we should not have gotten out of.&quot;

On June 25, 2009, Citysearch launched the &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot; challenge, inviting anyone to create a brand new business at Sidewalk.com that enable users to live life on the go more easily. Participants are called to submit a brilliant idea for a web and mobile application that includes access to Citysearch&#x27;s taxonomy, directory, content and other open APIs focused on local. Selected by a panel of judges, the creator of the winning application will win $10,000 in cash and, possibly, the opportunity to develop and manage a new business venture with up to $1 million in funding and an equity stake in the new Sidewalk.com venture, and access to the Citysearch publisher network allowing them to instantly monetize traffic.

As of October 2012, the site is controlled by Citysearch subsidiary CityGrid Media and contains very limited content.

<doc id="1163393" wikidata="Q382369" url="?curid=1163393" title="Mehdi Bazargan">
<text>Mehdi Bazargan (; 1 September 1907 – 20 January 1995) was an Iranian scholar, academic, long-time pro-democracy activist and head of Iran&#x27;s interim government. 

One of the leading figures of Iranian Revolution of 1979, he was appointed prime minister in February 1979 by Ayatollah Khomeini, making him Iran&#x27;s first prime minister after the revolution. He resigned his position in November of the same year, in protest at the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran and as an acknowledgement of his government&#x27;s failure in preventing it.

He was the head of the first engineering department of University of Tehran.

==Early life and education==

Bazargan was born into an Azerbaijani family in Tehran on 1 September 1907. His father, Hajj Abbasqoli Tabrizi (died 1954) was a self-made merchant and a religious activist in &quot;bazaar&quot; guilds.

Bazargan went to France to receive university education through an Iranian government scholarship during the reign of Reza Shah. He attended Lycée Georges Clemenceau in Nantes and was a classmate of Abdollah Riazi. Bazargan then studied thermodynamics and engineering at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (École Centrale Paris).

Following his return to Iran, Bazargan was called up for conscription, and served from 1935 to 1937. According to Houchang Chehabi, Bazargan was firstly tasked with shifting pebbles in a barracks but was then moved to translate technical articles from French.

==Career==
After his graduation, Bazargan became the head of the first engineering department at Tehran University in the late 1940s. He was a deputy minister under Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh in the 1950s. Bazargan served as the first Iranian head of the National Iranian Oil Company under the administration of Prime Minister Mosaddegh.

Bazargan co-founded the Liberation Movement of Iran in 1961, a party similar in its program to Mossadegh&#x27;s National Front. Although he accepted the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as the legitimate head of state, he was jailed several times on political grounds. A strong admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, he praised Gandhi&#x27;s ideas and the Indian independence movement in his writings in jail as an ideal example for Iranians.

===Iranian Revolution===
On 4 February 1979, Bazargan was appointed prime minister of Iran by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He was seen as one of the democratic and liberal figureheads of the revolution who came into conflict with the more radical religious leaders – including Khomeini himself – as the revolution progressed. Although pious, Bazargan initially disputed the name &quot;Islamic Republic&quot;, wanting an &quot;Islamic Democratic Republic.&quot; He had also been a supporter of the original (non-theocratic) revolutionary draft constitution, and opposed the Assembly of Experts for Constitution and the constitution they wrote that was eventually adopted as Iran&#x27;s constitution. Seeing his government&#x27;s lack of power, in March 1979, he submitted his resignation to Khomeini. Khomeini did not accept his resignation, and in April 1979, he and his cabinet members were reported to have escaped an assassination attempt.

Bazargan resigned, along with his cabinet, on 4 November 1979, following the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy. His resignation was considered a protest against the hostage-taking and a recognition of his government&#x27;s inability to free the hostages, but it was also clear that his hopes for liberal democracy and an accommodation with the West would not prevail. 
Bazargan continued in Iranian politics as a member of the first Parliament (&quot;Majles&quot;) of the newly formed Islamic Republic. He openly opposed the Cultural Revolution and continued to advocate civil rule and democracy. In November 1982, he expressed his frustration with the direction the Islamic Revolution had taken in an open letter to the then speaker of parliament Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

The government has created an atmosphere of terror, fear, revenge and national disintegration. ... What has the ruling elite done in nearly four years, besides bringing death and destruction, packing the prisons and the cemeteries in every city, creating long queues, shortages, high prices, unemployment, poverty, homeless people, repetitious slogans and a dark future?
His term as a member of parliament lasted until 1984. During his term, he served as a lawmaker of the Freedom Movement of Iran, which he had founded in 1961, and which was abolished in 1990. In 1985, the Council of Guardians denied Bazargan&#x27;s petition to run for president.

===Views===
Bazargan is a respected figure within the ranks of modern Muslim thinkers, known as a representative of liberal-democratic Islamic thought and a thinker who emphasized the necessity of constitutional and democratic policies. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution Bazargan led a faction that opposed the Revolutionary Council dominated by the Islamic Republican Party and personalities such as Ayatollah Mohammad Hosseini Beheshti. He opposed the continuation of the Iran–Iraq War and the involvement of Islamists in all aspects of politics, economy and society. Consequently, he faced harassment from militants and young revolutionaries within Iran.

===Attacks===
On 8 April 1978, Bazargan&#x27;s house in Tehran was bombed. The underground committee for revenge, a reputed state-financed organization, proclaimed the responsibility of the bombing.

===Laws of social evolution===
Bazargan is known for some of the earliest work in human thermodynamics, as found in his 1946 chapter &quot;A Physiological Analysis of Human Thermodynamics&quot; and his 1956 book &quot;Love and Worship: Human Thermodynamics&quot;, the latter of which being written while in prison, in which he attempted to show that religion and worship are a byproduct of evolution, as explained in English naturalist Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), and that the true laws of society are based on the laws of thermodynamics.

==Death==
Bazargan died of a heart attack on 20 January 1995 at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland after collapsing at Zurich Airport. He was travelling to the United States for heart surgery.

==Personal life==
Bazargan married Malak Tabatabai in 1939. They had five children, two sons and three daughters.

<text>Ramiro Corrales (born March 12, 1977) is an American former professional soccer player. He spent most of his professional playing career with the San Jose Earthquakes in Major League Soccer.

Known as a &quot;reliable contributor who [is] strong in defense, composed and responsible with the ball and who works hard to make his teammates better&quot;, Corrales was the last remaining active MLS player from its inaugural season in 1996 upon his 2013 retirement.

==Club career==

===San Jose Clash (1996–1997)===
Born in Salinas, California, Corrales did not play college soccer; instead he signed with the California Jaguars of USISL. He then became a professional and entered the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. This was before the advent of Project-40, so Corrales forfeited any opportunity to guarantee a college scholarship. Corrales was drafted 81st by the Columbus Crew but was then immediately traded to the San Jose Clash (later to be renamed &quot;Earthquakes&quot;) for a second-round selection in the MLS Supplemental draft.

Ramiro made his MLS debut on April 28, 1996, as a substitute in a match against the LA Galaxy. His first assist came a couple months later on June 8 against the Dallas Burn and his first goal came off a free kick against the Tampa Bay Mutiny on September 9. In his rookie season for the San Jose Clash, he garnered a goal and an assist playing 11 matches. He started in 11 games the following season.

=== MetroStars (1998–2000) ===
In November 1997, Corrales was drafted 16th by the Miami Fusion in the 1997 Expansion Draft. He was traded again in June 1998, this time to the MetroStars in exchange for Carlos Parra. In 1998 Corrales played in 3 matches for the Metros, getting one assist. The 1999 season saw Corrales take a large amount of playing time with the club in a total 31 appearances. He was second on the team in minutes with 1,460. The 2000 season saw Corrales split his time between the Metrostars and the US Olympic squad who were going through Olympic qualification and the 2000 Summer Olympics soccer tournament. Corrales ended the season with two assists in twenty two games played.

=== San Jose Earthquakes (2001–2004) ===
In 2001, Corrales was traded back to San Jose for the rights to goalkeeper Paul Grafer. There, he was an integral part of coach Frank Yallop&#x27;s squad that won the 2001 and 2003 MLS Cups. The 2002 season was one of Corrales&#x27; best, scoring three goals and providing nine assists in 28 matches played, both career highs. In nine years in MLS, Corrales scored nine goals and provided 19 assists.

=== HamKam (2005–2006) ===
Seeking to leave MLS, Corrales signed with Norwegian club Hamarkameratene on a three-year contract. He was part of a wave of American MLS players who went to Scandinavia to seek better wages and European play. He was signed to play as a central midfielder at the club but he mainly played as left back while sometimes being used as a left midfielder. In the 2006 season he scored his first goal in Norway, a free kick goal against IK Start. He was selected the club player of the year in the 2006 season by both local newspaper Hamar Arbeiderblad and as voted by the fans on the club&#x27;s official homepage. Due to the fact that HamKam was relegated at the end of the season, rumors swirled about where Corrales would leave to. He was rumored to be heading for Spain or Belgium, though IK Start in Norway seemed to be the front runner to sign him.

=== Brann (2007) ===
On January 5, 2007, Hamarkameratene and Brann agreed on a transfer, but Corrales was expelled from Norway on February 9 by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, leaving it uncertain if he could play for Brann. Corrales was expelled because he had played the whole 2006 season without a work-permit. The case was solved on March 14 when the Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board (UNE) gave Corrales a new work-permit. Corrales dealt with injuries and made only 17 appearances overall for the club, but scored a goal and helped lead Brann to their first title since 1963.

After a US versus Sweden training match in January 2008, Ramiro refused to return to Bergen and expressed that he would rather give up soccer than return. He claimed he did not like the Bergen weather, although he later said he would accept a move to Oslo which has a more dry climate than Bergen. He also modified his statement to he did not like being benched. Corrales was rumored to return to MLS with Toronto FC and former club New York Red Bulls showing interest. The Houston Dynamo still held his rights, which were kept by the team since their move from San Jose in 2006, and so any return to MLS would have to go through Houston.

=== Return to San Jose Earthquakes (2008–2013) ===
Corrales eventually returned to the United States in 2008, re-signing for the San Jose Earthquakes, who bought his rights from the Houston Dynamo. He made his first appearance for the Quakes since 2004 on April 3, in a match against the LA Galaxy. He scored his first goal in his new stint on May 10 against the Columbus Crew.

After the departure of Quakes captain Nick Garcia in a trade, Corrales was selected by Frank Yallop to be the next player to lead the team. Yallop cited Corrales&#x27; experience, calm but stern leadership, and being bilingual as reasons for selecting him as captain. In 2009, he became the team&#x27;s all-time leader in appearances with his 164th, in their match against FC Dallas on October 7 passing Richard Mulrooney to grab the record.

In 2010, he led the Quakes to the Eastern Conference Final of the MLS Cup playoffs, the club reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2005. They passed the New York Red Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, after the Quakes were down a goal in the first leg.

Entering into 2011, Corrales was dealing with more frequent injuries, and so he started to adapt to becoming more of a mentor than just a player. At the start of the season he was one of three players to have remained since the inaugural MLS season, the other two being Zach Thornton and Frankie Hejduk. In 2011, he played in his 200th career match for San Jose against the New York Red Bulls on July 2, becoming the first player to reach 200 games played with San Jose.

In 2012, he had a career year, captaining the Quakes in their Supporters Shield-winning season. He was selected by MLS commissioner Don Garber to participate in the 2012 MLS All Star game, his first ever. He played for 35 minutes in the match against Chelsea after being subbed in during the 56th minute for San Jose teammate Justin Morrow. He finished the season with two goals and seven assists, the assists tally the second highest in his career. When off-season came, Corrales saw his option declined by San Jose on November 28, 2012. He subsequently entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft. He was re-signed by the Earthquakes for the 2013 season in both a playing and coaching capacity in February 2013.

He reached the 300th MLS appearance mark in a match against the Houston Dynamo in 2013, becoming the 21st player in MLS history to hit that mark. Corrales played his last game on October 26, 2013, against FC Dallas at Buck Shaw Stadium; he played as a starter and was subbed out in the 69th minute treated with a standing ovation and teammates carrying him off the pitch. He passed on his captain&#x27;s armband to Chris Wondolowski, which served not only a practical in game purpose but also symbolized the transition of player leadership for the next season on, with Wondolowski serving as captain starting in 2014.

In 2018, he came out of retirement to become a player-coach for Premier Development League team Santa Cruz Breakers FC in their debut season.

== Post-playing career ==
In April 2021, he joined the technical staff of USL Championship expansion side Monterey Bay FC. Corrales and head coach Frank Yallop were both let go from their positions on July 31, 2024.

==Career statistics==


== International ==
Corrales was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent. Ramiro has earned appearances for the United States national team, playing for the U-20 and U-23 teams along with four caps for the senior team in the 90&#x27;s (his first coming October 16, 1996 against Peru). He also appeared in two games at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, helping the United States reach the semifinals. He was finally recalled in 2008 after an eight-year absence.

<doc id="1163412" wikidata="Q6987443" url="?curid=1163412" title="Negotiation theory">
<text>The foundations of negotiation theory are decision analysis, behavioral decision-making, game theory, and negotiation analysis.
Another classification of theories distinguishes between Structural Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Process Analysis, Integrative Analysis, and behavioral analysis of negotiations.

Negotiation is a strategic discussion that resolves an issue in a way that both parties find acceptable. Individuals should make separate, interactive decisions; and &quot;negotiation analysis&quot; considers how groups of reasonably bright individuals should and could make joint, collaborative decisions. These theories are interleaved and should be approached from the synthetic perspective.

==Common assumptions of most theories==
Negotiation is a specialized and formal version of conflict resolution, most frequently employed when important issues must be agreed upon. Negotiation is necessary when one party requires the other party&#x27;s agreement to achieve its aim. The aim of negotiating is to build a shared environment leading to long-term trust, and it often involves a third, neutral party to extract the issues from the emotions and keep the individuals concerned focused. It is a powerful method for resolving conflict and requires skill and experience. Henry Kissinger defined negotiation as &quot;a process of combining conflicting positions into a common position under a decision rule of unanimity, a phenomenon in which the outcome is determined by the process.&quot; Druckman adds that negotiations pass through stages that consist of agenda-setting, a search for guiding principles, defining the issues, bargaining for favorable concession exchanges, and a search for implementing details. Transitions between stages are referred to as turning points.

Most theories of negotiations share the notion of negotiations as a process, but they differ in their description of the process.

Structural, strategic, and procedural analysis builds on rational actors, who are able to prioritize clear goals, are able to make trade-offs between conflicting values, are consistent in their behavioral patterns, and are able to take uncertainty into account.

Negotiations differ from mere coercion, in that negotiating parties have the theoretical possibility to withdraw from negotiations. It is easier to study bilateral negotiations, as opposed to multilateral negotiations.

==Structural analysis==
Structural Analysis is based on a distribution of empowering elements among two negotiating parties. Structural theory moves away from traditional Realist notions of power in that it does not only consider power to be a possession, manifested for example in economic or military resources, but also thinks of power as a relation.

Based on the distribution of elements, in structural analysis we find either power-symmetry between equally strong parties or power-asymmetry between a stronger and a weaker party. All elements from which the respective parties can draw power constitute structure. They may be of material nature, i.e., hard power (such as weapons), or of social nature, i.e., soft power (such as norms, contracts, or precedents).

These instrumental elements of power, are either defined as parties’ relative position (resources position) or as their relative ability to make their options prevail.

According to structural analysis, negotiations can be described with matrices, such as the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, a concept taken from game theory. Another common example is the game of Chicken.

Structural analysis is easy to criticize, because it predicts that the strongest will always win. This, however, does not always hold true.

==Strategic analysis==
Strategic analysis starts with the assumption that both parties have a veto. Thus, in essence, negotiating parties can cooperate (C) or defect (D). Structural analysis then evaluates Á outcomes of negotiations (C, C; C, D; D, D; D, C), by assigning values to each of the possible outcomes. 
Often, cooperation of both sides yields the best outcome. The problem is that the parties can never be sure that the other is going to cooperate, mainly because of two reasons: first, decisions are made at the same time or, second, concessions of one side might not be returned. Therefore, the parties have contradicting incentives to cooperate or defect. If one party cooperates or makes a concession and the other does not, the defecting party might relatively gain more.

Trust may be built only in repetitive games through the emergence of reliable patterns of behavior, such as tit-for-tat.

==Process analysis==
Process analysis is the theory closest to haggling. 
Process Analysis focuses on the study of the dynamics of processes. E.g., both Zeuthen and Cross tried to find a formula in order to predict the behavior of the other party in finding a rate of concession, in order to predict the likely outcome.

The process of negotiation, therefore, is considered to unfold between fixed points: starting point of discord, endpoint of convergence. The so-called security point, which is the result of optional withdrawal, is also taken into account.

An important feature of negotiation processes is the idea of turning points (TPs). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to analyses of TPs in single and comparative case studies, as well as experiments. Considered as departures in the process, Druckman has proposed a three-part framework for analysis in which precipitating events precede (and cause) departures which have immediate and delayed consequences. Precipitating events can be external as when a mediator becomes involved, substantive as when a new idea is proposed, or procedural as when the formal plenary structure becomes divided into committees. Departures can be abrupt or relatively slow and consequences can escalate, moving away from agreement, or they might move in the direction of agreement. Using this framework in a comparative study of 34 cases, Druckman discovered that external events were needed to move talks on security or arms control toward agreement. However, new ideas or changed procedures were more important for progress in trade or political negotiations. Different patterns were also found for interest-based, cognitive-based, and values-based conflicts and between domestic and international negotiations.

Turning points are also analyzed in relation to negotiation crises or disruptions in the flow of the talks. Earlier research showed that TPs are more likely to occur in the context of crises, often in the form of changes that put the talks back on track and transition to a new stage (Druckman, 1986, 2001). A key to resolving crises is reframing the issues being discussed. The choice to reframe was shown to occur more frequently among negotiators when their trust is low and transaction costs are high. The research to date on TPs has generated ideas likely to stimulate further studies. Some of these ideas include a search for the underlying mechanisms that can explain the emergence of TPs. Foremost among these are flexibility and adaptability in response to crises or violations of expected behavior. The key challenge is to discover the conditions that foster progress toward a solution to the dilemma of balancing the desire to agree with the desire to come out favorably. For a review of the research on turning points, see Druckman and Olekalns.

==Integrative analysis==
Integrative analysis divides the process into successive stages, rather than talking about fixed points. It extends analysis to pre-negotiations stages, in which parties make first contacts. The outcome is explained as the performance of the actors at different stages. Stages may include pre-negotiations, finding a formula of distribution, crest behavior, settlement

==Bad faith negotiation==
Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.

===Inherent bad faith model in international relations and political psychology===
Bad faith in political science and political psychology refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of information processing. The &quot;inherent bad faith model&quot; of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles’ beliefs and his model of information processing. It is the most widely studied model of one&#x27;s opponent. A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles’ position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel&#x27;s initial position on the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<text>Participatory budgeting (PB) is a type of citizen sourcing in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget through a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making. Participatory budgeting allows citizens or residents of a locality to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.

Participatory budgeting processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth. A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government transparency and accountability, increased levels of public participation (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning. Participatory budgeting stands as one of several democratic innovations—such as British Columbia&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Assembly—encompassing the ideals of a participatory democracy.

Frameworks of participatory budgeting differ throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. Participatory budgeting, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region&#x27;s particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of participatory budgeting vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, participatory budgeting has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, participatory budgeting has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology. As of 2014, participatory budgeting has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.

== History ==


Participatory budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party (PT), drawing on the party&#x27;s stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a springboard for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the Brazilian Democratic Movement in municipalities such as Pelotas), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1989. Porto Alegre is the capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center; at that time of implementation, it had a population of 1.2 million. The initial success of participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented participatory budgeting, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.

===Porto Alegre===

In its first Title, the 1988 Constitution of Brazil states: &quot;All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution.&quot; The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of military dictatorship, and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge.

Brazil&#x27;s contemporary political economy is an outgrowth of the Portuguese empire&#x27;s patrimonial capitalism, where &quot;power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships&quot;. Unlike the Athenian ideal of democracy, in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil&#x27;s government is structured as a republic with elected representatives. This creates a separation between the state and civil society, which has opened the doors for clientelism. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain &#x27;clients&#x27;, typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader who represents the views of shop owners may ask a local party official for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. At the same time, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party officials and influential citizens rather than the broader public.

In 1989, Olívio Dutra won the mayor&#x27;s seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT&#x27;s organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is what we now know as participatory budgeting.

PB was active in Porto Alegre until 2017. Over time, city leaders’ political support for the participatory budget has declined, and Porto Alegre’s current leadership has suspended the process.

== Pre-requisites ==
According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for participatory budgeting to be adopted: &quot;[…] strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators&#x27; attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens.&quot;

There are generally two approaches through which participatory budgeting formulates: &quot;top-down&quot; and &quot;bottom-up&quot;. In the top-down approach, the adoption of participatory budgeting is required by the federal government (for example, as in Peru). In the bottom-up approach, local governments initiate participatory budgeting independent from the national agenda (such as in Porto Alegre); with this approach, NGO&#x27;s and local organizations play crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members.

==Procedure==
Broadly, all participatory budgeting programs allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives sub-jurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. Therefore, mediating institutions are also needed to combine budget preferences expressed by sub-jurisdictions.

Participatory budgeting processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps:

# The municipality decides how much of its budget to allocate to PB projects. For example, in 2018, Czech municipalities have devoted 3.7M Euro to PB, which was about 0.6% of their total expenditures. In 2023, Paris decided to devote about 75 million Euro to PB in 2023 (see List of participatory budgeting votes for details about other countries). 
# The municipality may be divided geographically into multiple districts, so that the residents in each district can focus on projects more relevant to them. The budget available for each district is also determined at this stage.
# Representatives of the districts, either elected or volunteered, work with government officials in a PB committee. The committees meet regularly to deliberate under a specific timeline, and come up with preliminary project proposals.
# Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc. Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on. The initial proposals are developed into feasible proposals by focus groups and experts. In several rounds of deliberation, the list of proposals is shortlisted and finalized.
# The short-list of proposals is put to a public vote. See Participatory budgeting ballot types for various types of ballots that can be used in the voting process.
# A pre-determined aggregation rule is used to select the winning projects, and the municipal government implements the winning projects (see combinatorial participatory budgeting for a detailed discussion of various aggregation rules). 
This cycle of steps is repeated annually.

=== Digital participatory budgeting (e-participatory budgeting) ===
Technology has often used been to support participatory budgeting, which is commonly referred to as e-participatory budgeting. The use of digital technologies in the process was pioneered by the municipality of Ipatinga in Brazil, which offered the citizens the possibility to vote for projects via the Internet in 2001. The online voting option was later integrated to the participatory budgeting of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in 2003, and in the municipality of Belo Horizonte in 2006. Since then, the number of participatory budgeting initiatives that included online voting has multiplied around the world, and includes cities like Paris, New York City, Lisbon, Madrid, and Mexico City.

Although the effects of online voting in participatory budgeting have not been widely researched, a study in 2006 examining the case of participatory budgeting of Belo Horizonte suggests that online voting played a role in increasing the number of participants in the process. A 2015 study of Rio Grande do Sul showed an 8.2% increase in total turnout with the introduction of online voting, with the online channel more likely to attract participants who were younger, male, wealthier, and more educated. Despite these differences in participant demographics, a 2017 study found that the introduction of online voting in Rio Grande do Sul did not lead to a systematic difference in vote choices between online and offline voters.

Telephones—both mobile and fixed landlines—have also been used to stimulate uptake of participatory budgeting processes. The municipality of Ipatinga was the first to employ telephony in 2005, by creating a toll-free number for citizens to indicate their preferences for budget allotments, and by sending automated voice and text messages incentivizing citizens to attend the participatory budgeting meetings. Although some initiatives have used text messages to enable mobile voting—such as in La Plata, Argentina and Cascais, Portugal—most usage has been to encourage voting participation, either in-person or via the Internet.

A participatory budgeting algorithm is sometimes used in order to calculate the budget allocation from the votes. This algorithm takes as input a list of projects, the available budget, and the voters&#x27; preferences, and returns an allocation of the budget among the projects satisfying some pre-defined requirements.

== Outcomes ==

=== Improvement in citizens&#x27; well-being ===

Participatory budgeting has been shown to increase citizen&#x27;s overall well-being. Some examples include:

* Goncalves showed that increase in PB in Brazil lead to a reduction in infant mortality. The research found that infant mortality rates are substantially lower in governments that use participatory budgeting compared to those that do not. This is due to the fact that infant mortality disproportionately affects poorer income groups more than middle-upper groups, with participatory budgeting leading to an increase in pro-poor investments, such as health and sewage infrastructure. 
* A World Bank paper by Bhatnagar, et al. concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the poor. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as unemployment, it leads to &quot;noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various public welfare amenities&quot;. The paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, sewer and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. Additionally, the number of schools quadrupled since 1986. 
* A cross-national study found that greater participation in the preparation and execution of the budget corresponded to greater allocation of public funds in education. 
* A study examining the impact of participatory budgeting in New York City finds that it leads to a decrease in overall complaint calls to the 311 number, which indicates an improvement in public service performance. 
* A cross-country study found that participatory budgeting positively impacts on the well-being of underserved communities in Brazil, Peru, and South Korea.

These results suggest that countries who &quot;sustain participatory budgeting programs may be part of general improvements in governance that produce[s] more durable access to healthcare.&quot; Participatory budgeting has led to advancements in government because democratic governments with this kind of budgeting are able to make better use of public funding.

=== Government transparency ===

Participatory budgeting allows for effective and efficient policy changes, and positively influences aspects such as government transparency. Foremost, participatory budgeting increases budget transparency. In contrast, a lack of transparency can disconnect citizens from their government. For example, in the Dominican Republic, citizens reported that they did not feel they had a voice in their local government and claimed that they were not aware of how to participate in legislation within their districts. Due to this attitude, &quot;citizen&#x27;s perceptions of such things as why raising tax revenue is important, how public budgets are carried out, or how public works are paid for are often ill-informed.&quot;
=== Advancement in democracy ===
The Colombian organization Fundacion Solidaridad, which seeks to promote democratic developments through participatory budgeting practices, implemented seminars and practices to &quot;facilitate the exchange of experiences in participatory budgeting at the municipal level through dialogues and planning meetings.&quot; Fundacion Solidaridad&#x27;s approaches showed that participatory budgeting led to concrete advancements in democracy. The results concluded that participatory budgeting served as a platform for democratic societies to be able to partner with public institutions and international partners to be able to &quot;promote activities for democracy and transparency at the local level.&quot; Increased government transparency allows civic societies to have more impact within their own communities, as well as understand the importance of civic engagement.

After more than a decade, the high number of participants suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre&#x27;s health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).

Research also shows that participatory budgeting has a greater impact over longer periods of time. In a paper that updated the World Bank&#x27;s methodology, which expanded statistical scope and analyzed Brazil&#x27;s 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. The longer that a municipality used participatory budgeting, the more health and sanitation benefits accumulated. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term—it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term.

=== Citizens&#x27; attitudes ===
Several studies have found positive effects of PB on the citizens&#x27; attitudes towards the government:

* Soonhee Kim studied the effect of PB in South Korea on citizen participation, transparency, and public trust in government. He showed that when citizens participate in PB, they are more inclined to (1) support democracy, (2) perceive democracy as an effective institution, and (3) understand how governmental budgeting works. Through PB, citizens are able to acquire skills that allow them to be active citizens. Participatory budgeting has shown that it &quot;may help marginalized people and other previously excluded groups to build their self-esteem and self-fulfillment through their participation in local budget decisions&quot;. Civic participation has also shown to &quot;foster the attitudes and skills of citizenship&quot;, and shape identities and loyalties.
* Frenkiel studied three PB projects in China: one in Chengdu and two in Wenling, over seven years. She found that PB contributed to opening the decision-making process to formerly excluded participants, who are local elites and “super residents”.
* Kukuckova checked the effect on PB on the voter turnout in Czech Republic. The evidence regarding this issue is ambiguous. For example, implementing PB in Prague indeed increased the voter turnout at the municipal elections, but in other Czech cities, no significant effect was found.

=== Increase in tax revenues ===
Participatory budgeting has been associated with increased tax revenues. For instance:

* A study examining the case of Porto Alegre suggests that participatory budgeting contributed to an increase of 269% in own-source revenues from 1988 to 2004. 
* Another comparative study of 25 municipalities in Latin America and Europe found a significant reduction in tax delinquency after the adoption of participatory budgeting. 
* More conclusively, a World Bank study examining 253 cases of participatory budgeting in Brazil found that municipalities with the process collect 39% more local taxes than similar municipalities without it.

=== Adoption ===
Based on Porto Alegre&#x27;s system, more than 140 of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil (about 2.5%) have adopted participatory budgeting.

Participatory budgeting gives alternative ways for citizens be a part of the democratic process. This has encouraged a worldwide spread. Participatory budgeting is impactful in countries that struggle to provide public services and in rural communities marked by high levels of poverty. Another key adaptation of participatory budgeting is that it is &quot;far less likely to use specific rules that promote social justice and mandates the distribution of greater resources to underserved communities&quot;, which allows for greater opportunity to serve poor communities.

== Criticism ==

=== Lack of representation ===
Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre, a World Bank paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge. Nevertheless, studies show that although participants may not fully mirror the demographics of the population as a whole, participatory budgeting fares better than the status quo of traditional representative democracy institutions. For instance, political scientist Graham Smith notes that participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre has been substantially more effective in mobilizing women and citizens from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. In a similar vein, a report on New York City&#x27;s process shows that participatory budgeting was more successful in mobilizing people of color and low-income groups than local elections.

=== Clientelism ===
Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing clientelism.

=== Misallocation of resources ===
Participatory budgeting can harm other government projects, which may not be pursued due to finite resources being allocated elsewhere. In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects. Additionally, participatory budgeting has many barriers to entry for governments; thus, officials fear electoral costs. Institutions also might lack resources and political will to engage. Some institutions also lack the bureaucratic structure to be able to design and execute this kind of approach.

=== Low participation ===
In some PB elections, the participation rate is very low. For example, there are reports of 0.1% participation rate in Germany, and 1%-3% in Chicago in 2012 and 2014.

== Examples ==
=== Latin America ===

In 2012, around 40% of participatory budgeting programs were located in Latin America, where the concept and mechanics of the system were developed in the 1980s. The goal was to &quot;democratize democracy&quot; by engaging the general public, fighting clientelism, and mobilizing the underprivileged who had been left out and left behind by the Brazilian political system. The participatory pyramid consists of three levels: local assemblies that are open to all residents, district participation forums, and a general participatory council at the city level. The meetings&#x27; objectives include debating priorities and choosing representatives to oversee the implementation of recommendations. Anyone who desires to participate in open meetings is permitted to do so.

Porto Alegre, Brazil, is an interesting case of Latin American participatory budgeting: following some earlier attempts in smaller towns, participatory budgeting came into its own in Porto Alegre as a result of a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; that emerged following an electoral victory by the Workers&#x27; Party in 1988.

=== North America and Europe ===
Adaptations of the participatory democracy model are found mainly in Spain and Italy. Also widespread on the Iberian Peninsula are participatory budgets that incorporate elements of the &quot;multi-stakeholder participation model&quot;. The most widespread participatory budgets in Europe, however, are those that closely resemble the &quot;proximity participation model&quot;. Most notably, this model has been embraced in the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Latvia, and Estonia. Participatory budgeting has also taken root in North America, particularly Canada and the United States.

=== Africa ===
The development of participatory budgeting is relatively recent in Africa. Development took on impetus when the Federation of African Cities and Regional Governments (UCLGAA) took an active role promoting training and visibility regarding participatory budgeting at its triennial International Meeting, Africities, held in Dakar in 2012. The path followed in Africa is the same as the one followed by Latin American radical movements. It differs from European cases, where local governments played a major role. During the 2000s, alternative globalization networks exerted a strong impact.

=== Asia ===
Participatory budgets in Asia began to appear in larger numbers around 2005. Here, participatory budgeting programs were rarely built on pre-existing forms of citizen participation. The fast development of participatory budgets around the world led to the creation of continental networks supporting the dissemination of participatory budgeting. The experience of Porto Alegre, Brazil, has played a particularly important role as a point of reference. For example, local authorities and NGOs from South Korea and China have often visited Porto Alegre, especially since 2009; and in India, the Kerala participatory strategic planning experiment encountered Porto Alegre during the Mumbai World Social Forum.

In 2012, there were 58–109 active experiments in participatory budgeting in Asia.

<text>Bosse Field is a baseball stadium located in Evansville, Indiana seating 5,181 people, but with picnic area and standing room it can hold more than 8,000 people. Opened in 1915, it was the first municipally owned sports stadium in the United States and is the third-oldest ballpark still in regular use for professional baseball, surpassed only by Fenway Park (1912) in Boston and Wrigley Field (1914) in Chicago.

It is the home field for the professional Evansville Otters of the Frontier League, as well as high school and American Legion games, and in the past hosted spring training for the Detroit Tigers, college baseball, high school, college, and NFL football, college soccer, and concerts. Six Baseball Hall of Fame members played for Evansville teams at Bosse Field during their minor league careers, including Chuck Klein, Hank Greenberg, Warren Spahn, Bob Uecker, Bert Blyleven and Jack Morris. The historic stadium was also used in 1991 by Columbia Pictures for filming numerous game scenes in the 1992 comedy-drama, &quot;A League of Their Own.&quot;

==History==
Benjamin Bosse, mayor of Evansville from 1914 to 1922, reached an agreement with Thomas Garvin&#x27;s family shortly after taking office in January 1914 to purchase land on the north side of the city for a park. However, the city was in a deficit and could not afford the full $50,000 price. Mayor Bosse conceived of the plan to sell part of the land to the school board who would then build a new stadium to be used for school functions as well as Evansville&#x27;s baseball team, of which Bosse was a co-owner. When the president of the school board opposed the plan, Bosse had him replaced with a friend, and the new school board both approved the project and also voted to name it Bosse Field in honor of the mayor. Construction was completed the following summer, and Bosse Field opened on June 17, 1915. A Central League record crowd of 8,082 fans attended the stadium dedication and opening game, a 4–0 Evansville victory. Evansville was in third place when they moved to Bosse Field, but went on to win the league championship in 1915.

Ten baseball teams other than the Otters have played at Bosse Field. Some of the most famous are the Evansville Triplets (1970–84), Evansville Braves (1946–57), Evas/Pocketeers/Hubs (1919–1931) and the Evansville River Rats (1914–15). The River Rats had played in Evansville previously from (1903–1910) and (1901–1902). The Triplets won the American Association titles in 1972, 1975, and 1979. The River Rats won the Central League title in 1908 and 1915. The Braves won the Three-I League title in 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.

From 1921 to 1922, Bosse Field was used as a football stadium and was home to the Evansville Crimson Giants of the NFL.

The Otters franchise came to Evansville in 1995 and have attracted a record number of fans for the league. In 2006 the Otters won the Frontier League title.

Baseball Hall of Fame members Hank Greenberg, Chuck Klein, Edd Roush, Warren Spahn, and Sam Thompson played at Bosse Field during their careers; another 95 Hall of Fame members visited Bosse Field on opposing teams. There have been over 20 Major League Baseball players from Evansville and dozens of Minor Leaguers.

Football Hall of Fame member Bob Griese played high school football and American Legion baseball at Bosse Field; Don Mattingly, Andy Benes, Rob Maurer, Jeff Schulz, Alan Benes and Jamey Carroll all played at Bosse Field during their high school and/or college careers.

==Former/current professional teams==
Current / former professional teams who have called Bosse Field home, have won a combined 10 league titles.

<doc id="1163432" wikidata="Q642117" url="?curid=1163432" title="Siege of Nicaea">
<text>The siege of Nicaea was the first major battle of the First Crusade, taking place from 14 May to 19 June 1097. The city was under the control of the Seljuk Turks who opted to surrender to the Byzantines in fear of the crusaders breaking into the city. The siege was followed by the Battle of Dorylaeum and the Siege of Antioch, all taking place in modern Turkey.

==Background==
Nicaea, located on the eastern shore of Lake Askania, had been captured from the Byzantine Empire by the Seljuk Turks in 1081, and formed the capital of the Sultanate of Rûm. In 1096, the People&#x27;s Crusade, the first stage of the First Crusade, had plundered the land surrounding the city, before being destroyed by the Turks. As a result, sultan Kilij Arslan initially felt that the second wave of crusaders were not a threat. He left his family and his treasury behind in Nicaea and went east to fight the Danishmends for control of Melitene.

==Crusader siege==
The crusaders began to leave Constantinople at the end of April 1097. Godfrey of Bouillon was the first to arrive at Nicaea, with Bohemond of Taranto, Bohemond&#x27;s nephew Tancred, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and Robert II of Flanders following him, along with Peter the Hermit and some of the survivors of the People&#x27;s Crusade, and a small Byzantine force under Manuel Boutoumites. They arrived on 6 May, severely short of food, but Bohemond arranged for food to be brought by land and by sea. The crusaders put the city to siege beginning on 14 May, assigning their forces to different sections of the walls, which was well-defended with 200 towers and sent a message to Raymond to hurry his advance to aid the siege. Bohemond camped on the north side of the city, Godfrey on the south, and Raymond and Adhemar of Le Puy on the eastern gate.

==Defeat of Kilij Arslan==
On 16 May the Turkish defenders sallied out to attack the crusaders, but the Turks were defeated in a skirmish with the loss of 200 men. The Turks sent messages to Kilij Arslan begging him to return, and when he realized the strength of the crusaders he quickly turned back. An advance party was defeated by troops under Raymond and Robert II of Flanders on 20 May, and on 21 May the crusader army defeated Kilij in a pitched battle which lasted long into the night. Losses were heavy on both sides, but in the end the sultan retreated despite the pleas of the Nicaean Turks. The rest of the crusaders arrived throughout the rest of May, with Robert Curthose (accompanied by Ralph de Guader) and Stephen of Blois arriving at the beginning of June. Meanwhile, Raymond and Adhemar built a large siege engine, which was rolled up to the Gonatas Tower in order to engage the defenders on the walls while miners mined the tower from below. The tower was damaged but no further progress was made.

==Byzantine arrival==
Byzantine emperor Alexios I chose not to accompany the crusaders, but marched out behind them and made his camp at nearby Pelecanum. From there, he sent boats, rolled over the land, to help the crusaders blockade Lake Ascanius, which had up to this point been used by the Turks to supply Nicaea with food. The boats arrived on 17 June, under the command of Manuel Boutoumites. The general Tatikios was also sent, with 2,000 foot soldiers. Alexios had instructed Boutoumites to secretly negotiate the surrender of the city without the crusaders&#x27; knowledge. Tatikios was instructed to join with the crusaders and make a direct assault on the walls, while Boutoumites would pretend to do the same to make it look as if the Byzantines had captured the city in battle. This was done, and on 19 June the Turks surrendered to Boutoumites.

When the crusaders discovered what Alexios had done, they were quite angry, as they had hoped to plunder the city for money and supplies. Boutoumites, however, was named &quot;dux&quot; of Nicaea and forbade the crusaders from entering in groups larger than 10 men at a time. Boutoumites also expelled the Turkish generals, whom he considered just as untrustworthy. Kilij Arslan&#x27;s family went to Constantinople and were eventually released without ransom. Alexios gave the crusaders money, horses, and other gifts, but the crusaders were not pleased with this, believing they could have had even more if they had captured Nicaea themselves. Boutoumites would not permit them to leave until they had all sworn an oath of vassalage to Alexios, if they had not yet done so in Constantinople. As he had in Constantinople, Tancred at first refused, but he eventually gave in.

==Aftermath==
The crusaders left Nicaea on 26 June in two contingents: Bohemond, Tancred, Robert II of Flanders, and Tatikios in the vanguard, and Godfrey, Baldwin of Boulogne, Stephen, and Hugh of Vermandois in the rear. Tatikios was instructed to ensure the return of captured cities to the empire. Their spirits were high, and Stephen wrote to his wife Adela that they expected to be in Jerusalem in five weeks. On 1 July they defeated Kilij at the Battle of Dorylaeum, and by October they reached Antioch; they would not reach Jerusalem until two years after leaving Nicaea.

<text>A ruling clique is a group of people who jointly rule an oligarchic form of government.

Ruling cliques generally differ from another type of oligarchy: a military junta. Military juntas are always ruled by military personnel (often high-ranking like general). A ruling clique is typically formed by people from various professions, who, once in positions of power or leadership, tend to form councils, a political party, or perhaps some other form of organized group. Members of such a grouping may share a rough balance of power, although this may shift as members seek greater influence, often at the expense of others. Ruling cliques tend to reduce accountability within the governing elite, thereby steering the established political system towards one that is more autocratic, rather than democratic, in nature.

The danger of ruling cliques stems from the inherent self-interest of any informally organised system of political governance. This point is captured by George Orwell in the following quote, taken back from his 1943 work &#x27;Looking Back on the Spanish War&#x27;:“Nazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as &quot;the truth&quot; exists. […] The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, &quot;It never happened&quot;—well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five—well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs […]”Some ruling cliques could be considered a form of aristocracy while others are based on a very small circle of rulers rather than a broader based organization such as a political party. In some cases, the entire ruling clique is composed of a council of leaders who are the only members of the clique.

<doc id="1163461" wikidata="Q259737" url="?curid=1163461" title="Madge Sinclair">
<text>Madge Dorita Sinclair CD (née Walters; April 28, 1938 – December 20, 1995) was a Jamaican actress best known for her roles in &quot;Cornbread, Earl and Me&quot; (1975), &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; (1980–1986), and the ABC TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; (1977). Sinclair also voiced the character of Sarabi, Mufasa&#x27;s mate and Simba&#x27;s mother, in the Disney animated feature film &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). A five-time Emmy Award nominee, Sinclair won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Drama Series for her role as &quot;Empress&quot; Josephine in &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Fire&quot; in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Born Madge Dorita Walters in Kingston, Jamaica, to Jamaican parents Herbert and Jemima Walters, Sinclair studied at Shortwood College for Women. After completing her studies, she worked as a teacher in Jamaica until 1966, when she left for New York to pursue her career in acting. Sinclair began acting with Joseph Papp&#x27;s Public Theatre. In 1971 she portrayed Clytemnestra in the New York Shakespearean Festival production of &quot;The Wedding of Iphigenia&quot;.

==Career==
Sinclair made her film debut as Mrs. Scott in &quot;Conrack&quot; (1974) opposite Jon Voight; a role which earned her a nomination for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture. Her next major critical success was as Bell Reynolds in the 1977 ABC mini-series &quot;Roots&quot; for which she received her first nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award.

Following &quot;Roots&quot;, she starred in the 1978 film &quot;Convoy&quot; as the Widow Woman, and she played Leona Hamilton in &quot;Cornbread, Earl and Me&quot;. Also in 1978, she co-starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Grandpa Goes to Washington&quot;. Sinclair went on to a stint in the 1980s as nurse Ernestine Shoop on the series &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; opposite Pernell Roberts. She received three Emmy nominations for her work on the show, and critic Donald Bogle praised her for &quot;maintaining her composure and assurance no matter what the script imposed on her&quot;. In 1988, Sinclair played Queen Aoleon alongside James Earl Jones&#x27;s King Jaffe Joffer in the Eddie Murphy comedy &quot;Coming to America&quot;, which reunited her on screen with her &quot;Roots&quot; husband and co-star John Amos. Later, both Sinclair and Jones would reunite as the queen and king for the roles of Sarabi and Mufasa, Simba’s parents, in the Disney animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). The film became one of the best-selling titles ever on home video. It would also be her last film role. The two also collaborated on the series &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Fire&quot;, which earned Sinclair an Emmy in 1991 for Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series, famously beating out the expected winner, &quot;L.A. Law&quot; Diana Muldaur.

Sinclair played the role of Lally in the 1991 Channel 4 television miniseries &quot;The Orchid House&quot; (based on Phyllis Shand Allfrey&#x27;s novel of the same name), directed by Horace Ové, and also received critical praise for her supporting role in the 1992 television movie &quot;&quot; with JoBeth Williams. In 1993, Sinclair came to London to appear on stage at the Cochrane Theatre in &quot;The Lion&quot;, by Michael Abbensetts and directed by Horace Ové, for the Talawa Theatre Company. From 1994 to 1995, she played a supporting role in the short-lived ABC-TV sitcom &quot;Me and the Boys&quot;, which starred Steve Harvey. Sinclair, in her role as the captain of the USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, is commonly cited as the first female Starfleet starship captain to appear in &quot;Star Trek.&quot; Years later, Sinclair played Geordi La Forge&#x27;s mother, captain of the USS &quot;Hera&quot;, in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Interface&quot;. Her final acting role was in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Dream On&quot;, which first aired one month before her death.

==Personal life==
Sinclair was married to Royston Sinclair, a Jamaican police officer, from 1956 until 1969 and had two sons with him. In 1982, Sinclair married actor Dean Compton, to whom she was still married at the time of her death.

==Death==
Sinclair died on December 20, 1995, aged 57, following a 13-year battle with leukemia. Her remains were cremated and her ashes were scattered in her hometown in Jamaica. She was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction, rank of Commander, for service in the performing arts by prime minister of Jamaica, P. J. Patterson in October 2000.

<text>Enrique Roberto &quot;Henry&quot; Cuellar ( ; born September 19, 1955) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 2005. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district extends from the Rio Grande to San Antonio&#x27;s suburbs.

Cuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and briefly served as the Texas secretary of state in 2001, making him, as of 2025, the most recent Democrat to have held a statewide office in Texas.

Cuellar was first elected to Congress in 2004, after defeating incumbent Ciro Rodriguez in a primary challenge. He is considered a centrist or conservative Democrat within the House Democratic Caucus. He has since been comfortably reelected in every general election while surviving a number of competitive primary races, most notably in 2020 and 2022.

In early May 2024, Cuellar was indicted on money laundering, bribery and conspiracy charges by a federal grand jury in Houston, Texas. He is alleged to have accepted nearly $600,000 from Azerbaijan and a Mexican commercial bank in order to influence U.S. policy.

==Early life and education==
Cuellar was born in Laredo, Texas. Both of his parents were Mexican American. His father, Martin Siller Cuellar Sr. (1926–2019), was born in Tamaulipas, Mexico, and immigrated to the United States. His mother, former Odilia Perez (1928–2015), was a native of Zapata, Texas.

Cuellar graduated in 1973 from J. W. Nixon High School. He received an associate of arts degree from Laredo Community College, then known as Laredo Junior College. He then attended the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Science in foreign service. He also earned a Master of Arts (MA) in international trade from Texas A&amp;M International University, a Juris Doctor (JD) from the University of Texas School of Law, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin.

As of 2023, he was finishing a master&#x27;s in defense and strategic studies from the Naval War College.

==Early career==
In 1981, Cuellar opened his own law firm in Laredo and became a licensed customs broker in 1983. From 1984 to 1986 he taught at Texas A&amp;M International University as an adjunct professor of international commercial law.

===Texas House of Representatives===
Cuellar was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 2001, representing most of Laredo. During his time as a state representative, he served on the House Appropriations, Higher Education, and Calendar committees. He also served on several national legislative committees dealing with state budgets, the U.S.–Mexico border, and international trade.

===Texas Secretary of State===
In 2001, Governor Rick Perry appointed Cuellar to be Secretary of State of Texas. He served in the office for just over nine months until his resignation, after which Geoff Connor held the position in an acting capacity. , Cuellar is the last Democrat to have served in the role.

During his short time as Texas secretary of state, Cuellar issued an opinion that, while not legally binding, argued that home-rule cities in the state of Texas could not adopt ranked-choice voting for their elections under the Texas Constitution. That opinion has been the primary basis for the city of Austin, ignoring the passage of the city&#x27;s 2021 Proposition E, which would have adopted ranked-choice voting in Austin.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2002====

In 2002, Cuellar was the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in Texas&#x27;s 23rd congressional district. He lost to five-term incumbent Republican Henry Bonilla 52%–47% in the closest race Bonilla had faced up to that point.

====2004====

Cuellar spent much of early 2003 preparing for a rematch against Bonilla. However, redistricting shifted most of Laredo, which had been the heart of the 23rd since its creation in 1966, into the 28th district, represented by Ciro Rodriguez. Cuellar challenged Rodriguez, a former friend, for the nomination winning by 58 votes.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the campaign as &quot;nasty&quot;. The initial count gave Rodriguez a 145-vote lead, but after a recount Cuellar led by 58 votes. Cuellar&#x27;s victory was one of only two primary upsets of incumbents from either party in the entire country.

The 28th district was far more Democratic than the 23rd making him heavily favored in the general election. In November, he defeated the Republican by a 20-point margin, becoming the first Laredoan in over 20 years elected to represent the 28th district.

Cuellar&#x27;s election to the House in 2004 was a standout for Democrats in a year in which Republicans otherwise gained seats in Texas&#x27;s House delegation.

====2006====
On March 7, 2006, Cuellar again defeated Rodriguez in the Democratic primary with 52% of the vote in a three-way race. No Republican filed.

On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Texas Legislature had violated Latino voters&#x27; rights when it shifted most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs. As a result, nearly every congressional district from El Paso to San Antonio had to be redrawn, and the primary results for these districts were invalidated. A court drew a new map in which all of Laredo was moved into the 28th district while the south San Antonio area was moved to the 23rd. An election open to all candidates with a runoff if no candidate won 50% was scheduled for the date of the general election, November 7, 2006.

In the general election on November 7, 2006, Cuellar had no Republican opposition. He handily defeated Ron Avery of McQueeney, the chairman of the conservative Constitution Party in Guadalupe County, and Democrat Frank Enriquez, a McAllen trial attorney, with nearly 68% of the vote.

====2008====

Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary on March 4, 2008. In the general election, he outran President Barack Obama, winning nearly 70% of the vote to win reelection while the president won 56% in the district.

====2010====

Cuellar was unopposed for the Democratic nomination in 2010 and won reelection in the general election.

====2012====

Cuellar was opposed in the November 6 general election by Republican and Libertarian Party candidates.

Guadalupe County, a Republican stronghold that usually opposed Cuellar for reelection, was removed from the reconfigured 28th district.

Cuellar defeated the Republican, 112,262 votes (68%) to 49,095 votes (30%). Hisel took 2% of the vote, and a Green Party candidate received the remaining 1%.

====2014====

Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced no Republican opposition in 2014.

====2016====

Cuellar won a rematch in the March 1, 2016, Democratic primary with former Republican congressional candidate William R. Hayward, who switched parties to run again for the House. Cuellar received 49,962 votes (89.8%) to Hayward&#x27;s 5,682 (10.2%). Cuellar then defeated Republican Zeffen Patrick Hardin in the November 8 general election, 122,086 (66.2%) to 57,740 (31.3%). Green Party nominee Michael D. Cary received 4,616 votes (2.5%).

====2018====

In 2018, Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary. He won 84.4% (117,178 votes) in the general election.

====2020====

On January 11, 2019, the progressive organization Justice Democrats, which supported U.S. representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s successful 2018 primary campaign in New York City, announced that it was seeking a primary challenger against Cuellar in the Democratic primary scheduled for March 4, 2020. On July 13, 2019, the Justice Democrats organization announced its support for Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration and human rights attorney from Laredo who had announced a primary campaign against Cuellar. Cuellar defeated Cisneros 51.8% to 48.2% in the primary. He won the general election in November with 58.3% of the vote, defeating Republican nominee Sandra Whitten and Libertarian nominee Bekah Congdon.

====2022====

Cuellar finished first with a plurality in the Democratic primary, tallying 23,552 votes, 48.4%, over Cisneros, who received 22,745 votes, 46.9%. Cuellar and Cisneros qualified for the May runoff while a third candidate, Tannya Benavides, was eliminated after getting 2,289 votes (4.7%).

During the runoff, Cuellar faced renewed scrutiny over an incident in 2018 where he fired a pregnant staffer who had requested parental leave and subsequently suffered a miscarriage, and according to court documents, subsequently urged other staffers to help him discredit her.

On June 7, trailing by 281 votes in the runoff, Cisneros requested a recount to be conducted by the Texas Democratic Party. Cuellar extended his lead to a 289-vote margin during the recount. The Associated Press called the race on June 21, 2022. Cuellar went on to easily win reelection against the Republican nominee.

==== 2024 ====

During the primary election process, Cuellar gathered support from key party leaders; the endorsements were seen as a move to head off a primary challenge against him.

Leaders that endorsed him for 2024 included Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, whip Katherine Clark, and Democratic Caucus chair Pete Aguilar. Former speaker Nancy Pelosi, former majority leader Steny Hoyer and assistant democratic leader Jim Clyburn also endorsed Cuellar.

On July 1, 2024, it was reported that Cuellar&#x27;s office is the worst-paid U.S. House office. The median salary in his office is $47,480.

Cuellar faced Republican political newcomer and physician Jay Furman in the general election. Cuellar narrowly defeated Furman by just under a 5% winning margin, the closest election of his congressional career. Trump carried his district in the concurrent presidential election at the same time as well, making Cuellar one of 13 Democrats who won districts Trump won.

== Political positions ==

Cuellar is a conservative Democrat. He has described himself as a &quot;moderate centrist&quot;. During the 117th Congress, he voted with the Democratic caucus 96.8% of the time.

During the Trump administration, Cuellar voted with the Democratic majority 87.9% of the time, while voting with Trump&#x27;s stance 40.6% of the time. Cuellar was ranked the 6th-most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives in the first session of the 117th United States Congress by the Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy. He is one of two members belonging to the fiscally-conservative Blue Dog Democratic Coalition in the Texas congressional delegation.

As of August 2023, Cuellar had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 96% of the time.

===Immigration ===

In 2011, Cuellar authored and co-sponsored legislation seeking to honor slain ICE agent Jaime Zapata. Billed as a border security bill, it would increase cooperation among state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies during investigations of human and drug smuggling from Mexico.

In 2013, in a statement with House colleagues Beto O&#x27;Rourke and Filemon Vela Jr., Cuellar renewed his opposition to a border fence along the Rio Grande between the U.S. and Mexico. He denounced inclusion in the Senate immigration bill of an amendment sponsored by senators Bob Corker and John Hoeven that called for 700 additional miles of border fencing, calling the fence an antiquated solution to a modern problem. The fence, he said, ignores the economic ties between the two nations, which reached $500 billion in 2012.

Cuellar was one of three Democrats to vote for Kate&#x27;s Law, which expands maximum sentences for immigrants who reenter the U.S. after being deported. He supported legislation to strip federal funding for jurisdictions that have sanctuary policies in place.

===2008 primary===
On June 15, 2007, Cuellar endorsed then U.S. senator Hillary Clinton for president in 2008. He said, &quot;Senator Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House.&quot; In 2007, he held a fundraiser for Clinton in Laredo that raised over $200,000 and was attended by former president Bill Clinton.

=== Abortion ===
Cuellar opposes abortion rights. He expressed concerns that the Senate health care bill allowed federal funding for abortion. He has voted for a ban on abortion after 20 weeks.

In 2023, he was among the four democrats who voted amend the annual defense policy bill to ban a Biden administration policy that allowed service members to be reimbursed for abortion-related travel and other expenses.

In 2021, he was the only Democrat to vote against the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, which aims to preserve access to abortion nationwide. The Act was proposed in response to the Texas Heartbeat Act which bans abortion after 6 weeks in Texas.

=== Appropriations ===
Cuellar is the only Texas Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee and is prolific in using his perch to deliver federal funds to his district. In 2011, he delivered federal funding to open a Veterans Administration outpatient clinic operated jointly with UT Health San Antonio in Laredo, Texas. At the time, the mayor declared that the project &quot;would not have been possible&quot; without the congressman&#x27;s support.

In 2020, Cuellar secured $1.2 million in federal funding to support efforts to fight COVID-19 in Webb County.

=== Affordable Care Act ===
He supported the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which narrowly passed the House.

On March 21, 2010, Cuellar voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed the House by a vote of 219–212.

=== Bipartisan infrastructure deal ===
Cuellar was instrumental in shepherding through passage of the bipartisan infrastructure deal in 2021. He was one of nine moderate Democrats who threatened to boycott a procedural vote unless House leadership first allowed a vote on President Biden&#x27;s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The effort was successful and resulted in the successful passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.

=== Environmental issues ===
On June 26, 2009, Cuellar voted with the House majority to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act, also known as the cap and trade bill. In March 2023, Cuellar announced that he would vote to roll back environmental regulations in President Biden&#x27;s Inflation Reduction Act, making him one of only two Democrats to do so.

=== Immigration ===
In 2025, Cuellar was one of 46 House Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

=== LGBT rights ===
Cuellar supports legal same-sex marriage and voted for the Respect for Marriage Act.

In 2025, Cuellar was one of two House Democrats (the other being Vicente Gonzalez) to vote in favor of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would ban transgender athletes from participating in women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; sports at federally funded schools and educational institutions.

=== Marijuana ===
In 2020, Cuellar was one of six House Democrats to vote against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which aimed to legalize cannabis at the federal level. In 2014, he voted for a Republican measure blocking the implementation of a Washington, D.C., decriminalization law.

Cuellar is an opponent of the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment which would limit the enforcement of the federal law criminalizing marijuana in states that have legalized medical cannabis.

=== PRO Act ===
Cuellar voted against the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act in 2021 and 2022.

=== Perceptics ===
Cuellar has supported automated license plate recognition federal contractor Perceptics and has been linked to lobbying on behalf of the firm by Podesta Group. Perceptics CEO John Dalton called him a &quot;friendly congressman&quot; for Perceptics.

=== Foreign Policy ===
Cuellar supports US support for Ukraine in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion. In the wake of news that the Iranian regime was supplying drones to Russia to use in the war, Cuellar led a bipartisan letter calling for the Biden administration to cripple Iran&#x27;s access to technology so that American-made technology isn&#x27;t used to feed Russia&#x27;s war.

Cuellar voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

=== San Antonio to Monterrey rail ===
Cuellar is a leading proponent for the proposed expansion of passenger rail from San Antonio, Texas to Monterrey, Mexico, a project he has advocated for since 2008. He spearheaded support for feasibility studies by both the United States and Mexican governments on the proposal and has sought federal funding to supplement private funds in a public-private partnership. An agreement has been signed between United States and Mexican officials to explore the proposal.

The project is supported by Samuel García, governor of Nuevo León state where Monterrey is located. The governor visited Washington, DC in 2021 on a trip hosted by Cuellar&#x27;s office to build support for the proposal link. The train&#x27;s route would connect San Antonio to Monterrey in 2 hours, with a stop in Laredo, within Cuellar&#x27;s district.

=== Trump impeachment ===
On December 18, 2019, Cuellar voted in favor of both articles of impeachment against Trump.

Following the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, Cuellar called for a second impeachment of Donald Trump. On January 13, he voted in favor of impeachment.

== FBI investigation and indictment==
On January 19, 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Cuellar&#x27;s Laredo residence and campaign office as part of a federal probe relating to Azerbaijan, known for its practice of &quot;caviar diplomacy&quot; and money laundering scandals like the Azerbaijani Laundromat. A federal grand jury also issued subpoenas for records related to Cuellar, his wife, and at least one campaign staffer related to the matter. Cuellar has taken an interest in Azerbaijan and co-chairs the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.

As of May 2022, Cuellar&#x27;s lawyer maintained Cuellar was innocent and was not a target of the investigation; the FBI had made no statement at that point. In response, party leaders including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi reaffirmed their support for Cuellar. As of January 2023, no arrests had been made in the case, the FBI had not indicated Cuellar was a person of interest and Cueller was not believed to be the subject of the investigation. Cuellar easily won reelection following the incident.

On May 3, 2024, Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were indicted on money laundering, conspiracy, and bribery charges. The indictment says that nearly $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican commercial bank was laundered into shell companies owned by Imelda from December 2014 through at least November 2021. After the indictment was unsealed, Cuellar released a supportive statement regarding his wife. Former president Donald Trump defended Cuellar.

After Cuellar&#x27;s indictment, two political advisors he had worked with pled guilty to charges that they had conspired with Cuellar to launder more than $200,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank. Cuellar&#x27;s indictment accuses him of accepting money from a Mexican bank in exchange for &quot;influencing the Treasury Department to work around an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank&#x27;s interests.&quot; The advisors, including Cuellar&#x27;s former campaign manager, Colin Strother, allegedly facilitated the payments. Strother and Florencio &quot;Lencho&quot; Rendon struck plea deals in exchange for cooperating with the investigation into Cuellar; they each face up to 20 years in prison and fines in excess of $100,000. Cuellar has said he is innocent of the charges and that his actions were &quot;consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.&quot;

Cuellar is represented by criminal defense attorney Josh Berman of Clifford Chance LLP.

==Personal life==
Cuellar is one of eight children. His father was an immigrant migrant worker. A brother, Martin Cuellar, serves as Sheriff in Webb County. A sister, Rosie Cuellar, is the municipal judge in Rio Bravo.

Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, have two daughters. In 2014, Cuellar portrayed George Washington during the annual Washington&#x27;s Birthday Celebration in Laredo. Cuellar is Roman Catholic.

On October 2, 2023, at around 9:30.p.m. ET, Cuellar was held at gunpoint and carjacked by three robbers outside of his Washington, D.C., apartment residence. The suspects stole Cuellar&#x27;s vehicle, as well as his luggage, although the car and all of his belongings were recovered by law enforcement a few hours later. Cuellar was reportedly unharmed. A police investigation is ongoing.

<doc id="1163473" wikidata="Q30061575" url="?curid=1163473" title="Lewis and Clark National Historical Park">
<text>The Lewis and Clark National Historical Park (including the former Fort Clatsop National Memorial), located in the vicinity of the mouth of the Columbia River, commemorates the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Administration of the park, which includes both federal and state lands, is a cooperative effort of the National Park Service and the states of Oregon and Washington. The National Historical Park was dedicated on November 12, 2004.

After reaching the Pacific Ocean, the Corps of Discovery camped at Fort Clatsop in the winter of 1805–1806. The park features a replica of the fort and a nearby visitor center. Also included in the park are several sites on the north bank of the river in Washington and other sites in Oregon.

==Lewis and Clark National Historical Park==
The federal park began as Fort Clatsop National Memorial which was established on May 29, 1958. The memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. On October 30, 2004, it was redesignated Lewis and Clark National Historical Park with expanded jurisdiction over multiple sites, including:

* Fort Clatsop
* Fort to Sea Trail (dedicated on November 14, 2005)
* Netul Landing
* Salt Works
* Station Camp/Middle Village
* Clark&#x27;s Dismal Nitch

==Oregon State Parks==
===Ecola State Park===
Ecola State Park was the site of the Corps of Discovery&#x27;s 1806 trek over difficult terrain to see a beached whale. Today, it features several miles of hiking trails through old-growth forest and several beaches. Haystack Rock and the Needles are visible from many sites in the park.

===Fort Stevens State Park===
Fort Stevens, with its park, offers exploration of history, nature, and recreational opportunities. The fort was the Oregon component of the three-fort Harbor Defense Command area at the mouth of the Columbia River (Fort Canby and Fort Columbia were the other two).

===Sunset Beach State Recreation Site===
Sunset Beach is the terminus of the Fort To Sea Trail, which begins in Fort Clatsop. Sunset Beach also provides visitors with direct access to the Pacific Ocean with expansive views from Cape Disappointment to the north and Tillamook Head to the south.

==Washington State Parks==
===Cape Disappointment State Park===
Cape Disappointment State Park, formerly known as Fort Canby State Park, is a camping park on Cape Disappointment on the Long Beach Peninsula, fronted by the Pacific Ocean. The park offers of ocean beach, two lighthouses, an interpretive center, hiking trails, and the remains of Fort Canby. The Cape Disappointment Historic District was listed on the National Register on August 15, 1975.

===Fort Columbia State Park===
Fort Columbia State Park preserves Fort Columbia, a coastal artillery post along the north side of the Columbia river outlet. At , the park includes an interpretive center focused on the fort and regional history.

Chinook Point, the site from which an American captain, Robert Gray, first saw the Columbia River, is part of the park. His explorations gave the United States a strong position in its later territorial contests with Great Britain. Chinook Point was named a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

<text>An emergency physician (often called an &quot;ER doctor&quot; in the United States) is a physician who works in an emergency department to care for ill patients. The emergency physician specializes in advanced cardiac life support (advanced life support in Europe), resuscitation, trauma care such as fractures and soft tissue injuries, and management of other life-threatening situations.

In some European countries (e.g. Germany, Belgium, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden), emergency physicians/anaesthetists are also part of the emergency medical service. They are dispatched together with emergency medical technicians and paramedics in cases of potentially life-threatening situations for patients (heart attacks, serious accidents, resuscitations or unconsciousness, strokes, drug overdoses, etc.). In the United States, emergency physicians are mostly hospital-based, but also work on air ambulances and mobile intensive-care units.

Patients who are brought in the emergency department are usually sent to triage first. The patient may be triaged by an emergency physician, a paramedic, or a nurse; in the United States, triage is usually performed by a registered nurse. If the patient requires admission to the hospital, another physician, such as an internal medicine physician, cardiologist, or neurologist takes over from the emergency physician.

== Training in the United States ==
The standard training route of emergency physicians in the United States is four years of college, four years of an approved medical school, and then a three- or four-year residency in emergency medicine. After completion of residency it is common for American emergency physicians to work in a hospital&#x27;s emergency department and take the board certification necessary to become certified in emergency medicine. This includes a 300+ question written exam followed by an oral examination.

== Role in healthcare ==
Emergency physicians in the United States typically work in emergency departments. Patients come in for a variety of reasons, including severe, life-threatening complaints such as strokes and heart attacks, potentially life-threatening complaints like severe abdominal pain, and less severe complaints such as mild injuries. The emergency physician is expected to oversee their care, rule out life-threatening diseases, stabilize the patient if necessary, and decide if the patient needs to be admitted to the hospital for further care or discharged home to follow up as an outpatient. Emergency physicians work with a large number of other professionals, including physician assistants/nurse practitioners, registered nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, medical technicians, medical scribes, and more. For more information on what the practice of an emergency physician looks like, see emergency medicine.

==Fellowship==
Some additional training paths after becoming an emergency physician include:
*Toxicology
*Wilderness medicine
*Emergency ultrasound
*Trauma and/or critical care
*Sports medicine
*Pediatric emergency medicine
*Medical education
*International emergency medicine
*Hyperbaric and undersea medicine
*Emergency medical services (EMS) and disaster medicine
*Aerospace medicine

These training paths are recognized by the American Academy of Emergency Medicine and are anywhere from 1–2 years in length.

<doc id="1163476" wikidata="Q981919" url="?curid=1163476" title="Fannett, Texas">
<text>Fannett is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,363 at the 2020 census. It is about southwest of Beaumont and is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area.

==History==
The community is named after B. J. Fannett, a local landowner who opened a general store there in the 1890s. When Japanese immigrants brought rice farming to the area, Fannett grew to meet the farmers&#x27; needs.

In 1993 and again in 2004, Fannett was the center of a controversy over the naming of Jap Road (now Boondocks Road). The road had been named in the early 20th century in reference to the immigrant rice farmer Yoshio Mayumi. However, as social awareness increased over time, it became clear that the name was never meant to honor Mayumi and had always been an ethnic slur. Instead of naming the road after Mayumi, it was decided to change the name to Boondocks Road.

Fannett is home to the Clifton Steamboat Museum, which features a large exhibit on Lieutenant Commander Harry Brinkley Bass (after whom the United States Navy destroyer was named).

==Demographics==
Fannett first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,363 people, 871 households, and 588 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
In 1961, the Fannett Independent School District was combined with that of neighboring Hamshire, forming the Hamshire-Fannett Independent School District.

Hamshire-Fannett ISD is assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

<text>Elliot Liebow (1925–1994) was an American urban anthropologist and ethnographer. His works include &quot;Tally&#x27;s Corner&quot; and &quot;Tell Them Who I Am&quot;, both micro-sociological writings that were participant observer studies of people in poor areas. He also served as chief of the Center for the Study of Work and Mental Health at the National Institute of Mental Health.

&quot;Tally&#x27;s Corner&quot; served as Liebow&#x27;s PhD dissertation for Catholic University of America. The book has been considered a &quot;classic&quot; ethnography of black street-corner society in Washington DC featuring the narratives of young unemployed and casually employed black men about work, their families, friends and themselves. It has sold more than a million copies. However, the book has also been widely criticized for failing to explore or acknowledge the constraints of institutional and systemic racism on the lives and social conditions of Black people.

Liebow was also a poet.

&quot;Tell Them Who I Am&quot; accounts the everyday life of homeless women in Washington D.C. Liebow&#x27;s purpose for the book was to &quot;write a straight forward description of shelter life,&quot; &quot;see the world of homelessness as homeless women see and experience it,&quot; and explain &quot;how these women remained human in the face of inhuman conditions.&quot;

<doc id="1163496" wikidata="Q3980283" url="?curid=1163496" title="Take Me as I Am (Faith Hill album)">
<text>Take Me as I Am is the debut studio album by American country music singer Faith Hill, released on October 12, 1993, by Warner Bros. Nashville. The album has been certified 3× platinum in the United States for shipments of three million copies.

Four singles were released from the album. The first two—&quot;Wild One&quot; and &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;—reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart in 1994. &quot;Wild One,&quot; the tale of a rebellious teen-aged girl in conflict with her parents&#x27; more conservative ways, was the lead-off single, spending four weeks at No. 1 that January. &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, a cover of the 1967 song by Erma Franklin, was issued as the follow-up. The third single, &quot;But I Will&quot;, also charted, and the title track reached No. 2 in 1994.

==Critical reception==

Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that on &quot;But I Will&quot;, &quot;the power of her pliable, pure country voice has never been better showcased than on this heartfelt ballad about a woman who&#x27;s had just about enough.&quot;

<doc id="1163502" wikidata="Q495306" url="?curid=1163502" title="Pernell Roberts">
<text>Pernell Elven Roberts Jr. (May 18, 1928 – January 24, 2010) was an American stage, film, and television actor, activist, and singer. In addition to guest-starring in over 60 television series, he was best known for his roles as Ben Cartwright&#x27;s eldest son Adam Cartwright on the Western television series &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–1965), and as chief surgeon John McIntyre, the title character on &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; (1979–1986).

Roberts was also known for his lifelong activism, which included participation in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 and pressuring NBC to refrain from hiring White people to portray minority characters.

==Early life==
Roberts was born on May 18, 1928 in Waycross, Georgia, the only child of Pernell Elven Roberts Sr., a Dr Pepper salesman, and Minnie (Betty) Myrtle Morgan Roberts. During his high-school years, Pernell played the horn, acted in school and church plays, and sang in local USO shows. He attended, but did not graduate from, Georgia Tech. Enlisting in 1946, he served for two years in the United States Marine Corps. He played the tuba and horn in the Marine Corps Band, and he was also skilled at playing the sousaphone and percussion. He later attended, also without graduating, the University of Maryland, where he had his first exposure to acting in classical theatre. He appeared in four productions while a student, including &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;, but left school to act in summer stock.

== Professional theatre ==
In 1949, he made his professional stage debut with Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle in &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; at the Olney Theatre in Olney, Maryland. Later, he spent eight weeks at the Bryn Mawr College Theatre in Philadelphia, portraying Dan in Emlyn Williams&#x27; &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; and Alfred Doolittle in Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.

In 1952, Roberts moved to New York City, where he appeared first off-Broadway in one-act operas and ballets with the North American Lyric Theatre, with the Shakespearewrights, at the Equity Library Theatre, and later on Broadway with performances in &quot;Tonight in Samarkand&quot; (also in Washington, DC), &quot;The Lovers&quot; opposite Joanne Woodward, and &quot;A Clearing in the Woods&quot; with Robert Culp and Kim Stanley. He won a Drama Desk Award in 1955 for his performance in an off-Broadway rendition of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which was followed by the role of Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He performed in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot;, and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; at the American Shakespeare Festival, and later on Broadway. He performed in &quot;St. Joan&quot; (1954, Cleveland), &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; (at the Provincetown Playhouse), &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and &quot;King John&quot;.

In 1956, Roberts returned to the Olney Theatre, starring opposite Jan Farrand in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with the Players, Inc. group. The same year, Roberts made his television debut in the &quot;Shadow of Suspicion&quot; episode of &quot;Kraft Television Theater&quot;, followed by guest-starring roles in &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, &quot;Buckskin&quot;, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;.

==Transition to film and television==
Roberts signed a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1957, and made his film debut a year later as one of Burl Ives&#x27; contentious sons in &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (1958). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. He also landed a character role in &quot;The Sheepman&quot; (1958), opposite Glenn Ford and Shirley MacLaine, and continued to guest-star on television shows such as episodes of &quot;Shirley Temple Storybook Theater&quot; (&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Hiawatha&quot;), the live-broadcast &quot;Matinee Theater&quot;, where he starred again in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, and in &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot;. This was followed by appearances in &quot;Trackdown&quot;, &quot;Buckskin&quot;, and episodes of &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;. Roberts guest-starred as Captain Jacques Chavez on the NBC adventure series &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1958). He appeared with fellow guest star Fay Spain in the 1958 episode &quot;Pick Up the Gun&quot; of &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot; and played the lead villain Travis in the 31st episode (&quot;Hey Boy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;) of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, portraying a killer boss exploiter of Chinese coolie laborers. The episode aired 4/11/1958.

In 1959, Roberts guest-starred in episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Detectives&quot;, and &quot;House Call&quot;. Also in 1959, he co-starred in the film &quot;Ride Lonesome&quot;. &quot;If Roberts felt typecast by Westerns, they also provided his finest role in this film, arguably the greatest of the B-movies starring Randolph Scott and directed by Budd Boetticher. Roberts recognized the film&#x27;s classic structure; his engaging outlaw, Sam Boone, counterpoints Scott&#x27;s granite-faced Ben Brigade, maintaining the tension of whether they will work together or clash. He similarly played off James Coburn, who was making his film debut as Boone&#x27;s quiet sidekick, Whit.&quot; The same year, he was cast in &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

===&quot;Bonanza&quot;===

Roberts played Ben Cartwright&#x27;s urbane eldest son Adam, in the Western television series &quot;Bonanza&quot;. Unlike his brothers, Adam was a university-educated architectural engineer.

Roberts, having largely been &quot;a stage actor, accustomed as he was to a rigorous diet of the classics&quot; and to freely move about from part to part, found the &quot;transition to a television series&quot;, playing the same character, &quot;without costume changes&quot;, a difficult one. &quot;It was perhaps not surprising that, despite enormous success, he left &quot;Bonanza&quot; after the 1964–65 season, criticizing the show&#x27;s simple-minded content and lack of minority actors...&quot;. It particularly distressed him that his character, a man in his 30s, had to defer continually to the wishes of his widowed father, and he reportedly disliked the series itself, calling it &quot;junk&quot; television and accusing NBC of &quot;perpetuating banality and contributing to the dehumanization of the industry.&quot; The equally self-critical Roberts (&quot;I guess I&#x27;ll never be satisfied with my own work&quot;), &quot;had long disdained the medium&#x27;s commercialization of his craft and its mass-production, assembly-line mindset.&quot; Frustrated with &quot;Bonanza&quot; and angry, he told a reporter in 1965, &quot;I feel I&#x27;m an aristocrat in my field of endeavor. My being part of &quot;Bonanza&quot; was like Isaac Stern sitting in with Lawrence Welk&quot;.

In much later interviews, Roberts denied statements about &quot;Bonanza&quot; attributed to him. &quot;I did not enjoy &quot;Bonanza&quot; anymore...but I never said those things people said I said.&quot; He was, however, &quot;too wise not to recognize its weaknesses.&quot; In a 1963 interview, he asked a reporter, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it a bit silly for three adult males to have to ask father&#x27;s permission for everything they do?&quot; &quot;They told me the four characters (Lorne Greene, patriarch Ben, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon as his brothers) would be carefully defined and the scripts carefully prepared; none of it ever happened,&quot; he complained to the Associated Press in 1964. He objected to how &quot;Bonanza&quot; portrayed the relationship between the &quot;father&quot; and adult &quot;sons&quot;, describing it as &quot;adolescent&quot;.

Roberts acknowledged reasons for &quot;Bonanza&quot;&#x27;s appeal, but pointed to his personal need for story lines with greater social relevance, adult themes, and dialogue. He wanted &quot;Bonanza&quot; to be &quot;a little more grown up&quot; (&quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;, 1966). He also noted that he was not suited to the &quot;procedural&quot; and &quot;confining aspect&quot; of series television, another reason for his dissatisfaction, while on the show.(&quot;Mike Douglas Show,&quot; 1966)
Roberts had high hopes for what he could contribute to &quot;Bonanza&quot; and was disappointed with the direction of the show, and the limitations imposed on his &quot;Bonanza&quot; character and on his acting range. In a newspaper interview, he said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t grown at all since the series began...I have an impotent role. Wherever I turn there&#x27;s the father image.&quot;

Finally, after disagreements with writers and producers over the quality of the scripts, characterization, and &quot;Bonanza&quot;&#x27;s refusal to allow him to perform elsewhere while on contract, Roberts &quot;turned his back on Hollywood wisdom and well-meant advice,&quot; and left, largely to return to legitimate theater.

Roberts fulfilled, but did not extend his six-year contract for &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and when he left the series, his character was eliminated with the explanation that Adam had &quot;moved away.&quot; Later episodes suggested variously that Adam was &quot;at sea&quot;, had moved to Europe, or was on the East Coast, running that end of the family business. The last episode Pernell Roberts worked on was &quot;Dead and Gone&quot;, air date April 4, 1965. He appeared in the next two that aired, which were filmed prior to &quot;Dead and Gone&quot; — &quot;A Good Night&#x27;s Rest&quot;, air date April 11, 1965, and &quot;To Own The World&quot;, air date April 18, 1965. Adam Cartwright was mentioned on occasion in the series (including a 1967 episode that did not air until April 4, 1971 (&quot;Kingdom of Fear&quot;). 

Bonanza producer David Dortort described Roberts as &quot;rebellious, outspoken... and aloof,&quot; but as one who &quot;could make any scene he was in better...&quot;. In a later archive interview, he regretted not having insisted on a &quot;marriage for Adam&quot; and having Roberts continue on the show as a semiregular. He added, &quot;I must confess..I was too hard on him. I did not appreciate him. I knew he was good, but I didn&#x27;t realize he was good[...] none better.&quot; In the last two &quot;Bonanza&quot; movies that aired on NBC in the early 1990s, the story line stated that Adam, now in Australia, had equaled his father&#x27;s success, dominating the engineering/construction business.

==== Singing ====

Roberts was the only accomplished singer of the original cast, though David Canary, who joined &quot;Bonanza&quot; in 1967, had a background in voice and performed on Broadway. During Roberts&#x27; &quot;Bonanza&quot; years, he recorded &quot;Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies&quot;, a folk music album, which &quot;AllMusic&quot; calls &quot;...the softer, lyrical side of folk music — pleasant and not challenging, but quite rewarding in its unassuming way.&quot; The album, released by RCA Victor and arranged by Dick Rosmini, is available on compact disc only as part of the fourth disc of the &quot;Bonanza&quot; 4-CD boxed set on Bear Family Records.

On the &quot;Bonanza&quot; box-set albums, Roberts also sings &quot;Early One Morning&quot;, &quot;In the Pines&quot;, &quot;The New Born King&quot;, &quot;The Bold Soldier&quot;, &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;, &quot;Sylvie&quot;, &quot;Lily of the West&quot;, &quot;The Water is Wide&quot;, &quot;Rake and a Ramblin&#x27; Boy&quot;, &quot;A Quiet Girl&quot;, &quot;Shady Grove&quot;, &quot;Alberta&quot;, and &quot;Empty Pocket Blues&quot;.

==Mixed theatre, film and television==
After &quot;Bonanza&quot;, Roberts played summer stock theatre, regional theaters, and episodic TV, which gave him the opportunity to play a wide variety of roles. He toured with musicals such as &quot;The King and I,&quot; &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, &quot;Camelot&quot;, and &quot;The Music Man&quot;, and dramas such as &quot;Tiny Alice&quot;. He played Jigger in an ABC television presentation of &quot;Carousel&quot; and was featured in a CBS Playhouse production, &quot;Dear Friends&quot;.

In 1967, Roberts starred in the lavish, but short-lived David Merrick production of &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, directed by Vincente Minnelli. The show had a much-publicized &quot;chaotic&quot; preview performance due to technical problems stemming from lack of rehearsal time at the National Theatre in Washington, DC, where the preview performance took place. &quot;What was offered the people of Washington was a dress rehearsal. David Merrick spoke to the audience beforehand warning them of this.&quot; Problems were corrected by the official opening night, when the show received good reviews for Roberts, musical score and lyrics, stage design, and costumes, but poor reviews for its co-star and other aspects of the production. The show, nevertheless, was thought to have the potential to continue to Broadway. &quot;&quot;Mata Hari&quot; was a show with a great story, two fascinating characters, and some accessory mess that could have easily been tidied up by anyone but Vincente Minnelli.&quot; But Merrick, &quot;instead of bringing someone to clean house closed the production down&quot;.

In 1972, Roberts returned to Broadway and toured with Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, in which he played the title role. &quot;Particularly helpful is Pernell Roberts in the acted-upon title role... This actor is a sturdy, not unamusing leading-man type and may his appearance as a Bergman costar be rewarded beyond &quot;Bonanza&quot;.&quot;

In 1973, Roberts was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for his performance in &quot;Welcome Home&quot; at the Ivanhoe Theatre in Chicago. The same year, Roberts starred as Rhett Butler opposite Lesley Ann Warren, in another major production, &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; at the Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, again receiving good personal reviews, amidst weak reviews for the rest of the show.

His additional stage credits after &quot;Bonanza&quot; include &quot;Two for the Seesaw,&quot; &quot;A Thousand Clowns,&quot; &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest,&quot; &quot;Any Wednesday,&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (as Captain von Trapp). He did &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; while still playing in &quot;Bonanza&quot; in 1963.

In television interviews, Roberts said that he would have stayed with &quot;Bonanza&quot;, had he been allowed to do so on a part-time basis to enable him to return to theater. 

Roberts played Jim Conrad, the lead role, in the 1971 TV movie that served as a pilot for the series &quot;San Francisco International Airport&quot;, though the role was played by Lloyd Bridges in the actual episodes of the series. Roberts guest-starred in TV shows such as &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.,&quot; &quot;The Virginian,&quot; &quot;The Big Valley,&quot; &quot;Lancer,&quot; &quot;&quot; (four episodes), &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.,&quot; &quot;The Wild Wild West,&quot; &quot;Ironside&quot; (two episodes), &quot;The Rockford Files,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;Mannix,&quot; &quot;Vega$,&quot; &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; &quot;Hawaii Five-O,&quot; &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries,&quot; &quot;Nakia,&quot; &quot;Night Gallery,&quot; &quot;The Bold Ones,&quot; &quot;The Quest,&quot; &quot;Police Story,&quot; &quot;Most Wanted,&quot; &quot;Westside Medical,&quot; &quot;Man from Atlantis,&quot; &quot;Jigsaw John,&quot; &quot;Sixth Sense,&quot; &quot;Quincy, M.E. &quot; &quot;The Feather and Father Gang,&quot; &quot;Hawkins,&quot; &quot;Men from Shiloh,&quot; &quot;Perry Mason,&quot; &quot;Wide World of Mystery,&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man,&quot; and appeared in miniseries, including &quot;Captains and the Kings,&quot; &quot;Centennial,&quot; &quot;The Immigrants&quot;, and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days.&quot; He starred in two cult films, &quot;Four Rode Out&quot; (1971) and &quot;Kashmiri Run&quot; (1970), directed by veteran TV director John Peyser, and other feature films, including &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; (1978). He co-starred or was featured in several TV movies, including, &quot;The Adventures of Nick Carter,&quot; &quot;Dead Man on the Run,&quot; &quot;Assignment Vienna&quot;&#x27;s pilot &quot;Assignment: Munich&quot;, &quot;The Night Rider,&quot; &quot;The Silent Gun,&quot; &quot;The Lives of Jenny Dolan&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Tower,&quot; &quot;Hot Rod,&quot; &quot;Desperado,&quot; &quot;The Bravos,&quot; and &quot;High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane&quot;.

=== &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;===
In 1979, Roberts again achieved star status as the lead in &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; (1979–1986), receiving an Emmy nomination in 1981, and playing the character twice as long as Wayne Rogers had (1972–1975) on CBS″s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; series. Roberts told &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1979 that he chose to return to weekly television after watching his father age and realizing that it was a vulnerable time to be without financial security. &quot;The show allowed Roberts both to use his dramatic range and to address issues,&quot; wrote &quot;The Independent.&quot;

In the 1980s and 1990s, playing off his &quot;Trapper John M.D.&quot; persona, Roberts acted as TV spokesman for Ecotrin, a brand of ASA-based analgesic tablets. His roles since included &quot;Donor&quot; (1990) with Melissa Gilbert and &quot;Checkered Flag&quot; (1990). He appeared as captain of the CBS teams for &quot;Battle of the Network Stars 11 and 12&quot;.

Of the period between series, Roberts said he enjoyed moving around and playing different characters. During that time, he also toured university campuses conducting seminars on play production, acting, and poetry.

===Final roles===

In 1980, Roberts reunited with his former &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-star Lorne Greene, for two episodes of &quot;Vega$&quot;.

In 1988, Roberts co-starred with Milla Jovovich in the TV movie &quot;The Night Train to Kathmandu.&quot;

He guest-starred as Hezekiah Horn in the powerful &quot;Young Riders&quot; episode, &quot;Requiem for a Hero&quot;, for which he won a Western Heritage Award in 1991.

In interviews, Roberts had described television as a &quot;director&#x27;s and film cutter&#x27;s medium,&quot; but he himself was described as a &quot;born television actor... low key.&quot;

He narrated documentaries, including the National Geographic episode, &quot;Alaska, The Great Land&quot; in 1965, &quot;In the Realm of the Alligator&quot; in 1986, the TV special &quot;Code One&quot; about the work of paramedics in 1989, and &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; episode of the History Channel, 1999.

From 1991 to 1993, in his last venture into series television, Roberts lent his distinctive voice to host and narrate the TV anthology series, &quot;&quot;. He made his last TV appearance in 1997 on an episode of &quot;&quot;, updating a &quot;Mannix&quot; character he had portrayed decades before.

In his later life, and after the death of all of his former &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-stars, Roberts &quot;jokingly referred to himself as, &#x27;Pernell, the last one, Roberts.&#x27;&quot; He read &quot;Bonanza Gold Magazine&quot;, which was like looking at an old family album, he said, and watched reruns of &quot;Bonanza&quot; when he wanted to see old friends.

==Personal life and death==
Roberts married four times, first in 1951 to Vera Mowry — a professor of theatre history at Washington State University and subsequently Hunter College, as well as professor emerita of the PhD program in theatre at City University of New York, with whom he had his only child. Roberts and his first wife later divorced. His son died in a motorcycle accident in 1989.

Roberts married Judith Anna LeBrecque on October 15, 1962; they divorced in 1971. He subsequently married Kara Knack in 1972, divorcing in 1996.

At the time of his death from pancreatic cancer on January 24, 2010, Roberts was married to Eleanor Criswell.

<text>Runcorn Docks, originally the Bridgewater Docks, is an inland port on the Manchester Ship Canal in the town of Runcorn, Cheshire, England. It is operated by Peel Ports and handles bulk and project cargo.

==History==

===Early development===
It is possible that a small Roman port existed on the River Mersey at Runcorn. But the development of a port of any significance did not start until the Bridgewater Canal was extended to Runcorn in 1776. A line of ten locks was built from 1771–1773 to connect the Runcorn basin of the canal at 21.3m AOD with the River Mersey at 3.7m AOD. Close to this point, the Duke of Bridgewater built Bridgewater House from which to supervise the work. To the west of this area he built a dock (&#x27;Old Dock&#x27;), which opened in 1791. By 1825, a second flight of locks was constructed to deal with the volume of traffic. Together, this complex was known as the Bridgewater Docks.

Two further docks were developed on neighbouring Runcorn waterways: Weston Point Docks on the Weston Canal in 1810, and Old Quay Docks on the Runcorn to Latchford Canal in 1826. Thus the port of Runcorn comprised three separate companies: the Bridgewater Trustees, the Mersey and Irwell Company, and the Weaver Trustees.

In the early years of the 19th century, the amount of cargo passing through the docks steadily increased. From 1816 to 1834, the Bridgewater Dock increased its trade from 76,000 tons to 118,000 tons, and the Mersey and Irwell from 90,000 tons to 135,000 tons. To cope with this increased business, the Bridgewater Trustees built a new dock, Francis Dock, which opened in 1843. In 1844, the Mersey and Irwell Company was purchased by the Trustees of the Bridgewater Canal.

===Independent customs port===

Throughout this time, the port of Runcorn was part of the Port of Liverpool. The growing importance of Runcorn was recognised on 5 April 1847 when it was designated as an independent customs port. Its boundary extended on both sides of the Mersey, from Warrington Bridge in the east to a point on a line stretching from Eastham church in Cheshire to Chapel Farm House in Lancashire. It included the waters of the River Weaver up to Frodsham Bridge. On the north bank of the Mersey, it included Widnes Dock; the world&#x27;s first purpose-built railway dock. A new customs house was built to mark the event.

Runcorn&#x27;s status as an independent customs port was not a success. Few large ships were registered in the port or transferred from the Liverpool register, and on 12 April 1850 it returned to the Port of Liverpool. However, the port&#x27;s prospects improved with the abolition of the Navigation Acts (which had restricted the use of foreign shipping) in 1849, and an increasing number of foreign vessels began to arrive at the docks. Trade increased so much that the Bridgewater Trustees were having difficulty in coping with the increased trade. In 1853, an act promoted by the Earl of Ellesmere led to the construction of a short canal, the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which connected the Bridgewater Docks to the Weston Canal and Weston Point Docks. This opened for traffic on 25 February 1860. In the same year, the Bridgewater Trustees opened Alfred Dock, which was fitted with hydraulic cranes. At this time, the Runcorn docks were coming under increasing competition from the railways, especially from the St Helens Canal and Railway Company which opened Garston Dock downstream on the north bank of the Mersey.

Runcorn was appointed again as an independent customs port on 1 January 1862. In 1862, a telegraph line was installed which linked the dock with the Bridgewater Trustees&#x27; offices in Manchester and their dock in Liverpool. From around this time, there was a considerable increase in trade. In April of that year, over 110 vessels entered the port, which was more than could be conveniently accommodated. In order to deal with the increased trade, the Bridgewater Trustees began to build a new dock in 1867 and to remove obstructions from the river. It was named Arnold Dock and opened in 1870. Before the repeal of the Navigation Acts, most of the trade had been coastal, with virtually no foreign trade in 1845. Whereas in 1871, the export trade amounted to 43,000 tons and the imports more than 30,000. The Mersey and Irwell docks were not as successful as there were no major dock improvements after 1829 and the approach channels silted up. On the north bank of the Mersey, West Bank Dock at Widnes was busy especially with importing raw materials and exporting chemicals and fertilisers. The other major materials passing through the port were raw cotton, potter&#x27;s clay, salt, coal and soap.

During the 1870s, the business of the port was beginning to decline because of the progressive silting of the shipping channels. When the Duke of Bridgewater died in 1803, he left his coal mining and canal businesses to be run by a Trust. In 1872, the navigation part of the trust was sold to the Bridgewater Navigation Company at a cost of £1,115,000. This consisted of the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigations, together with their docks and warehouses. The company developed further improvements including a new dock, the Fenton Dock (named after the chairman of the company), which was completed in 1875 at a cost of £50,000. This was equipped with hydraulic cranes and served by high level tramways and railway sidings. Meanwhile, the Weaver Trustees were developing their trade, having built the Delamere Dock in 1870. The engineer for this dock was Edward Leader Williams who later became the engineer for the Manchester Ship Canal. There were no further large scale developments at the port until the Tollemache Dock was opened at Weston Point in 1885.

===Coming of the Manchester Ship Canal===

From about 1877, the silting of the channels started to improve and trade improved again. The improvement continued until 1889 when the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal caused problems. Trade declined again, and in 1894 the independent customs Port of Runcorn was abolished and incorporated into the Port of Manchester. Construction of the ship canal began in November 1877. On 3 August 1887, the Manchester Ship Canal Company purchased the Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1,710,000, thus acquiring the Bridgewater Canal and its docks and the Mersey and Irwell system. The ship canal allowed large ocean-going ships to access the Port of Runcorn. The canal was completed from Eastham to Weston Point by 1892, and in July of that year a temporary port called Saltport was established at the mouth of the River Weaver. By 1893, the ship canal was opened as far as the Old Quay Dock. In order to allow direct access to the Port of Runcorn and the Weaver Navigation, four locks were built. Weston Marsh lock at the mouth of the Weaver allowed access to the Weaver Navigation; Weston Mersey lock enabled entrance to the Weaver Docks; the Bridgewater docks were served by the Bridgewater lock; and the Old Quay dock by the Runcorn Old Quay lock. The ship canal was opened throughout its length in 1894. Saltport was bypassed and a few years later it was dismantled. To the east of the Bridgewater Dock, the ship canal passes under Runcorn Railway Bridge which has a clearance of above the high water mark of the Mersey. This meant that the larger of the tall ships could not pass under the bridge. A lay-by was therefore built for these ships to discharge their cargo, which was carried onwards by a lighter to its destination. The lay-by was big enough to accommodate the largest merchant vessels of the day. While the larger vessels approached the Runcorn docks by way of the ship canal, the smaller vessels sailed up the Mersey and entered the docks through the locks.

===Decline and recovery===

From the opening of the ship canal there was a temporary improvement in trade for the Runcorn docks but a decline set in from the turn of the century. There was a short revival after the First World War but this was not maintained. Improvements were made to Bridgewater Docks in 1935 but by 1950 the docks were &quot;virtually moribund&quot;. Trade at Runcorn Docks declined from 124,428 tons in 1925 to 32,881 tons in 1951, and at Weston Point Docks from 200,000 tons in 1938 to 40,000 tons in 1954. The old line of locks from the Bridgewater Canal was disused by the late 1930s. They were closed and filled in under the Ship Canal Act 1949. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure of the new line of locks, the old dock area and the Francis and Arnold Docks. The former Tidal Basin of the Bridgewater Docks assumed the name Francis Dock after the latter was filled in. The Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in to provide additional quay space for modern docks and the old warehouses were demolished.

With the construction of the Silver Jubilee Bridge in 1961, communications to the docks were improved and trade began to recover. The dock entrance to the ship canal was widened and the docks deepened. Trade increased from 50,000 tons in 1957 to 773,000 tons in 1973. In the month of December 2014, the Docks saw 50,126 tons of cargo in trade, the highest monthly tonnage recorded in the last quarter of a century.

==Present day==
Runcorn Docks is owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company which is part of the Peel Ports Group. It comprises Francis Dock (formerly the Tidal Basin, now berths No. 1–2), Alfred Dock (berths No. 3–5), and Fenton Dock (berths No. 6–9). It can take ships with cargoes up to 5000 tonnes with a maximum length of 350 feet (107m) and maximum draught of 7 metres. The adjacent canal lay-by has a deepwater berth of 168m. It has pipelines handling chemical and other liquid cargoes connecting to adjacent storage facilities and to the Ineos Chlor network.

<text>Monsefú, founded as San Pedro de Monsefú, is a town in Northern Peru, capital of the Monsefú district in the Chiclayo Province that is part of the Lambayeque Region. It is renowned for its food and handicrafts, which are on display at the annual FEXTICUM festival, named in 1973 by Professor Limberg Chero Ballena and held in July during the &quot;Fiestas Patrias&quot;. Monsefú is also the home of cumbia groups &quot;Grupo 5&quot; and &quot;Hermanos Yaipen&quot;. Monsefú was elevated to the category of &quot;city&quot; on October 26, 1888.

==Etymology==
Spanish priest Fernando de la Carrera, in his work &quot;Arte de la lengua yunga&quot; (1644), argues that the word &quot;monsefu&quot; comes from &quot;Omænssefæc&quot;, meaning &quot;God punishes the one who offends the earth&quot;.

==History==
Before the arrival of the Spanish, Monsefú would have been part of the chieftainship of Cinto, with the name of Chuspo, whose main center have been located in the vicinity of San Bartolo hill. In 1578, heavy rains and floods blighted the crops and in 1612, the area was ravaged by a disease. The population was reduced by the disease and survivors after a few years were located in what is now Monsefú.

In the early 1880s, the Chilean Army, under the command of Patricio Lynch, occupied the area and its surroundings during the War of the Pacific, where infrastructure was built by the Chilean authorities for both the locals and the troops&#x27; use, with the latter residing in a barracks. After the war, the town was elevated to city level on October 26, 1888 at the request of deputy Manuel María Izaga, under the presidency of Andrés Avelino Cáceres.

==Government==
===List of mayors===
The following is a list of mayors of Monsefú since the establishment of a municipal government:
==Climate==
It has a varied semitropical temperature, since part of its territory is on the shore of the sea, and another is located in the valley of the Reque River.

<doc id="1163522" wikidata="Q2298997" url="?curid=1163522" title="The Exies">
<text>The Exies are an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 1997. Their name, &quot;The Exies&quot;, is short for &quot;The Existentialists&quot;. Their two Virgin Records releases, &quot;Inertia&quot; (2003) and &quot;Head for the Door&quot; (2004), have sold over 400,000 copies combined.
On June 30, 2024 the band released a six song EP titled &quot;Closure ep.&quot;

==History==
The Exies formed in 1997 when singer and guitarist Scott Stevens drafted bassist Freddy Herrera and drummer Thom Sullivan to form a new group. Stevens&#x27; friend Chris Skane played guitar in an early incarnation of The Exies, but left citing other priorities. Skane was then replaced by guitarist David Walsh.

Stevens picked the name &quot;The Exies&quot; from a John Lennon biography, stating on Rockline (11/9/2002) that it was the only Beatles-related name left that was not taken. When the Beatles were touring around Hamburg, Germany in the 1960s, they encountered three distinct social groups among the kids: the mods, the rockers, and the art students (who referred to themselves as &quot;the existentialists&quot;). John Lennon coined the term &quot;the exies&quot; to refer to the art students.

The band released their self-titled debut album in 2000 on Ultimatum Records, and toured extensively. While touring, they caught the attention of Grammy-winning record producer, Matt Serletic, who bought their contract from the indie label they were on.

Thom Sullivan and The Exies parted ways in September 2000, and Dennis Wolfe joined the band. A few months later, one of their songs was featured on the animated series Gary &amp; Mike. The majority of 2001 and early 2002 was spent writing and recording. The band began touring in August 2002.

===&quot;Inertia&quot;===
In 2002 the band signed to Virgin Records and in January 2003 they released their second album, &quot;Inertia&quot;. The album received wide distribution, and their first single, &quot;My Goddess&quot;, received a fair amount of radio play and was featured in the PlayStation 2 game, &quot;&quot;. The song &quot;Without&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for EA Sports &quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot;.

The Exies continued touring in 2003 in support of Inertia, with &quot;My Goddess&quot; being performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and peaking at No. 12 on Modern Rock chart. The video for &quot;My Goddess&quot;, filmed by Diane Martel, became a top 10 hit on MTV2.

&quot;Inertia&quot; is The Exies&#x27; most successful album, reaching # 115 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===&quot;Head for the Door&quot;===
In June 2004, The Exies headed back into the studio with producer Nick Raskulinecz. Their third album &quot;Head for the Door&quot; was released in December 2004. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Ugly&quot;, was used by World Wrestling Entertainment as the theme song for that year&#x27;s &quot;Survivor Series 2004&quot; pay-per-view event in November 2004, and was featured in a commercial for the Warner Bros. television network. The song &quot;Slow Drain&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;NFL Street 2&quot;, which was released on the Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles. The band promoted the album by opening for Velvet Revolver on their first arena tour.

Along with Sum 41 and Silvertide, The Exies supported Mötley Crüe on their &quot;Carnival of Sins Tour&quot;.

Their second single from &quot;Head for the Door&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, is part of the PlayStation 2 video game, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, released in 2005. It is also part of the Xbox 360 game &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; via download through Xbox Live, along with &quot;Guitar Hero: Smash Hits&quot; on various consoles.

The song &quot;What You Deserve&quot; was also featured in the game &quot;Juiced&quot;.

The song &quot;Slow Drain&quot; was also featured in the games &quot;NFL Street 2&quot;, and the PlayStation 3 version of &quot;Full Auto 2&quot;.

===&quot;A Modern Way of Living with the Truth&quot;===
After returning from the tour with Mötley Crüe, Virgin decided to release the Exies from their contract. Soon after this, Dennis Wolfe and David Walsh left the band to pursue other goals. This left Stevens and Herrera alone, and decided to reunite with former guitarist Chris Skane and began writing songs. On 26 May 2006, the band announced on its blog that they were returning to the studio with producer James Michael to work on their fourth album. The album, &quot;A Modern Way of Living with the Truth&quot;, was released 15 May 2007 by Eleven Seven Music, the band&#x27;s new label.

To promote the album the band toured with Buckcherry, Papa Roach, and Hinder. This was followed by a tour with rock band Smile Empty Soul throughout the summer of 2007. After those shows, they toured with Drowning Pool for the &quot;This is for the Soldiers Tour&quot;. The band released five songs on MySpace and radio from &quot;A Modern Way of Living with the Truth&quot;: &quot;Different Than You&quot;, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, &quot;This Is the Sound&quot;, and &quot;A Fear of Being Alone&quot;. On June 28, The Exies released a music video for the song &quot;God We Look Good (Going Down in Flames)&quot;, a song that was left off the album.

In 2008, The Exies re-released &quot;A Modern Way of Living with the Truth&quot; on iTunes with five extra tracks. &quot;God We Look Good (Going Down in Flames)&quot; was included along with acoustic versions of &quot;My Goddess&quot;, &quot;Ugly&quot;, &quot;Genius&quot;, and &quot;Tired of You&quot;. Their song &quot;Lay Your Money Down&quot; was featured in the video game, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2009&quot;.

In 2008, internet rumors circulated that Scott Stevens was suffering from drug addiction. Stevens denied the drug abuse hearsay, and joked about the rumors during press interviews. In June, the Exies completed The Cage-Rattle Most Wanted Tour with Nu-metal band, Nonpoint. In October that year, they began a tour with TRUSTcompany.

In 2011 Scott Stevens co-wrote songs with Theory of a Deadman on their album The Truth Is..., David Cook on his album This Loud Morning and Halestorm&#x27;s album The Strange Case Of...

===&quot;Closure Ep&quot;===
On January 27, 2023, The Exies released their first song in fifteen years entitled, &quot;Spirits High.&quot; This was followed by the subsequent releases of singles &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; and &quot;s.A.D.&quot; before the release of the band&#x27;s first EP, titled &quot;Closure&quot;.

In an interview with Loudwire, band frontman Scott Stevens described their six new songs as &quot;all having meaning to them.&quot; According to Stevens, the EP comes straight from the heart, placing all their struggles and triumphs into an emotional 23 minutes and 15 seconds. When asked about the future of the band, Stevens replied, “I have a wishlist in my head that I’m trying to manifest by putting it out there.” He then goes on to explain that he is currently in the process of finding opportunities for future shows and projects, lending to the possibility that there may be more to come from The Exies in the future.

<text>Rubies of Eventide was a free to play (donation-funded) massively multiplayer online role-playing game previously published by American studio Mnemosyne, LLC. Powered by the Lithtech Jupiter engine, Rubies of Eventide is set in the medieval fantasy world of Vormis represented by a 3D world. The game launched in June 2003, shut down and restarted and after 6 years, ceased operation in August 2009.

==History==
CyberWarrior, Inc. launched Rubies of Eventide on 2 June 2003 as a paid service. Citing low subscription rates, CyberWarrior announced that the game would cease operations in December, 2003 but later managed to secure additional funding for some months. Later, two former CyberWarrior developers, together with the founder of the game, set up a private server to play the game with close friends and relatives, but found that some hardcore fans managed to hook themselves to their connection. After leasing the game to Mnemosyne, LLC. in 2004, the game continued to operate on a donation-based model. Players were able to start and play accounts for free (with limited server space), while patrons gain priority in game access during peak usage, and certain in-game benefits.

<doc id="1163530" wikidata="Q2923778" url="?curid=1163530" title="Brandon Prideaux">
<text>Brandon Prideaux (born August 18, 1976) is an American soccer coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the men&#x27;s soccer team at the University of Washington.

Prideaux spent most of his professional career in Major League Soccer, playing for the Kansas City Wizards, D.C. United, the Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire. His final game as a professional was on November 14, 2009, when his Fire team lost on penalties to Real Salt Lake in the 2009 MLS Cup Eastern Conference playoff final.

==Early life and college==
Born in Seattle, Washington, Prideaux is a native of Renton, Washington and a graduate of Kentridge High School.
Prideaux played college soccer for the University of Washington from 1994 to 1997.

==Playing career==
Upon graduating college in 1998, Prideaux joined the Seattle Sounders of the A-League. He excelled for the Sounders, registering two goals and ten assists while leading the team in minutes played.

Prideaux&#x27;s performance in the A-League attracted the attention of MLS, and he signed with the Kansas City Wizards for the 1999 season; he played in 15 games, starting 8, registering one assist. In his second year with the Wizards, Prideaux seized a starting role, starting all 31 of the games he played in, and helped lead the Wizards to an MLS Cup, playing a part in one of the best defenses in the league&#x27;s history. Prideaux played with the Wizards one more season, before being traded to D.C. United for Stephen Armstrong prior to the 2002 season.

Prideaux started 53 of 55 games he played for D.C. in 2002 and 2003, but had his starting position challenged in 2004 with the emergence of Josh Gros, and a tactical shift that led the team to play a 3-5-2 formation more often. Nevertheless, he started 16 games, and was a useful role player for the club. In 2005, he resumed his regular role, starting 28 of 29 games, but served primarily as a backup in 2006, playing in only 9 matches after suffering a knee injury. While in D.C., Prideaux coached the NCSL division 1 Arlington Warriors, and led them to great success in Metro area league. Prideaux has yet to score a goal after eight years in MLS and currently holds the record for most matches played without scoring having succeeded Nick Garcia after the latter finally scored his first in June 2006.

On December 15, 2006, D.C. United traded Prideaux to the Colorado Rapids in exchange for two draft picks.

Prideaux was waived by the Colorado Rapids on March 4, 2008, and was picked up by the Chicago Fire in the MLS Waiver Draft.

Prideaux announced his retirement from MLS on June 9, 2009, effective at the end of the season. 

==Coaching career==
Prideaux became an assistant coach at the University of Washington on January 1, 2010.
After his MLS career, he returned to his alma-mater where he is currently the assistant coach. His coaching style is known for taking examples of himself and his experience in the MLS.

<doc id="1163532" wikidata="Q5641835" url="?curid=1163532" title="Half tide dock">
<text>A half tide dock is a partially tidal dock. Typically the dock is entered at high tide. As the tide ebbs a sill or weir prevents the level dropping below a certain point, meaning that the ships in the dock remain afloat, although they still rise and fall with the tides above this. Half tide docks are particularly useful in areas with a large tidal range.
The sill of a half tide dock must be set sufficiently far below the daily high tide mark to allow ships to pass over it. Obviously this was easier to achieve with small ships of shallow draught, or in areas with a large tidal range. Inside the dock, the depth of water beneath the sill&#x27;s level depends only on the depth to which the dock was excavated, although this obviously increases construction costs.

The importance of the sill, and the tide&#x27;s height above it, is reflected by these dock sills becoming an important local datum level and for tide tables being calculated for heights above it (i.e. clear draught in and out of the dock). This importance has often continued for many years after the original sill had been replaced, as at Sharpness on the Severn Estuary, or where the dock had disappeared entirely, such as Old Dock Sill in Liverpool.

== A &quot;gate-flap&quot; half-tide dock ==

A modern refinement of the half-tide dock uses a &quot;gate-flap&quot;, which replaces a fixed sill with a hinged flap that opens as the tide rises, and closes as the tide ebbs. When open, the gate-flap rests horizontally at the seabed level. Operation is usually hydraulic, with automatic control; and warning lights or alarms will indicate when the gate-flap is about to be lowered or raised. The advantage over the older fixed sill is that, when the gate-flap is down, there is greater draught available to boats as there is no sill providing an obstacle. 

Such gate-flap systems are in place in Swansea, Padstow, Douglas, and Peel (the latter two in the Isle of Man).

<text>ORP &quot;Orzeł&quot; a Polish Navy submarine of Project 613 () . She was built in the Soviet Union as S-265 and was commissioned by the Polish Navy in 1962. She served under the pennant number 292 (317 for a brief period) and was decommissioned in 1983. It was one of the four Whiskey-class submarines operated by the Polish Navy, the other three being , and .

In 1968, during Warsaw Pact fleet exercise on Barents Sea, together with the other Polish submarine , she avoided detection by huge Soviet and East Germany ASW forces, consisting of 300 ships - including nuclear submarines - and about 500 aircraft, and unnoticed entered into the biggest Soviet naval base in Murmansk. A year later, guided by radio-guidance from Poland, &quot;Orzeł&quot; intercepted in the North Sea a Soviet and torpedoed her by dummy torpedoes. In implementing the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s Cold War strategy, she also led patrols in the North Atlantic, doing jobs there such as a continuous reconnaissance in close distance to NATO&#x27;s naval bases, including the most important U.S. strategic submarine base outside United States - Holy Loch in Scotland and also the base of Londonderry in Northern Ireland. She was also exercising the breaking of western marine communication lines in the North Atlantic, as well as carrying out tasks in the North Atlantic training programs, including &quot;Use of weapons and overcome ASW forces exercise program&quot;.

On 30 December 1983 she was decommissioned due to poor condition of her hull, after years of service, and scrapped in 1986. During her service, the ORP &quot;Orzeł&quot; was four times awarded as The Best Ship of Polish Navy (1963, 1965, 1972 and 1977).

<doc id="1163537" wikidata="Q89546" url="?curid=1163537" title="Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall">
<text>Joseph Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall (9 June 1774 – 23 November 1856) was an Austrian orientalist, historian and diplomat. He is considered one of the most accomplished orientalists of his time.

==Life==
Born Joseph Hammer in Graz, Duchy of Styria (now Styria, Austria), he received his early education mainly in Vienna. Entering the diplomatic service in 1796, he was appointed in 1799 to a position in the Austrian embassy in Istanbul, and in this capacity he took part in the expedition under Admiral William Sidney Smith and General John Hely-Hutchinson against France. In 1807 he returned home from the East, after which he was made a privy councillor.

In 1824 he was knighted and thereafter styled himself as &quot;Ritter Joseph von Hammer&quot;.

For fifty years Hammer-Purgstall wrote prolifically on the most diverse subjects and published numerous texts and translations of Arabic, Persian and Turkish authors. He was the first to publish a complete translation of the divan of Hafez into a western language. By traversing so large a field, he laid himself open to the criticism of specialists, and he was severely handled by Heinrich Friedrich von Diez (1751–1817), who, in his &quot;Unfug und Betrug in der morgenländischen Litteratur, nebst vielen hundert Proben von der groben Unwissenheit des H. v. Hammer zu Wien in Sprachen und Wissenschaften&quot; (1815), devoted to him nearly 600 pages of abuse. He also came into friendly conflict on the subject of the origin of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot; with his younger English contemporary Edward William Lane.

Hammer-Purgstall supported the foundation of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna and became the academy&#x27;s first president (1847–1849). The Austrian Oriental Society, founded in 1959 to foster cultural relations with the Near East, is formally named &#x27;Österreichische Orient-Gesellschaft Hammer-Purgstall&#x27; in recognition of Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s accomplishments.

In 1847 he received a medal commissioned by a friend of his, Ludwig August von Frankl. The reverse references some of his works in pictures.

He died in Vienna on 23 November 1856.

==Views==
Hammer considered the Greeks of his time to culturally belong with the Orient on linguistic and political grounds, rather than following the philhellenic trend of equating the Greeks with their classical legacy. In this regard, he seems to have stayed faithful to a late eighteenth-century intellectual tradition.

==Works==
Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s principal work is his (10 vols., Pest, 1827–1835; revised edition in 4 vols., 1834–1836; reprinted 1840). Among his other works are:

==Family==
Hammer married Caroline von Henikstein (1797–1844), the daughter of Austrian Jewish financier Joseph von Henikstein in 1816. In 1835, upon inheriting the estates of the Countess Purgstall (née Jane Anne Cranstoun), the Edinburgh-born widow of his late friend Gottfried Wenzel von Purgstall, he acquired the title &quot;Freiherr&quot; and changed his family name to Hammer-Purgstall. The Countess Purgstall&#x27;s sensationalist portrayal by her fellow Scotsman Basil Hall in &quot;Schloss Hainfeld; or, a Winter in Lower Styria&quot; (1836), an account of his visit as an invited guest to the Purgstall estates in 1834, may have served as an inspiration for the eponymous vampire protagonist of Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot;.

<text>The Carleton University Students&#x27; Association (or CUSA) is a non-profit corporation that represents the undergraduate students at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

== Governance ==
===Executive===
Executive members of CUSA are elected yearly. The executive is responsible for improving CUSA services, working on the issues important to you, and carrying out the daily work of the Association. The 2024/25 executive members are: 
* President – Sarah El Fitori 
* VP Finance-Treasurer – Samuel Easby
* VP Internal-Secretary – Aiden Rohacek
* VP Student Issues – Artur Estrela da Silva 
* VP Student Life – Nawalia Imtiaz

===New Governance Model===
In the October 2021 meeting, CUSA Council adopted the new governance structure on the advice of the Democratic Reform Committee and CUSA&#x27;s lawyers to comply with new provincial legislation and to expand decision making responsibilities and ethical safeguards. Based on the results of the 2021 general elections, it was evident that students wanted and voted for change, and the governance restructuring aimed to rebuild students&#x27; confidence on their money being used wisely by their students&#x27; association in the future.

==== Democratic Reform Committee ====
In October 2021, the CUSA Council was presented with the Democratic Reform Committee&#x27;s Final Report. Starting 11 August 2021, the Democratic Reform Committee (DRC) met twice every week with the goal of restoring student trust in CUSA that had been lost in recent years. Following the 2021 CUSA General Election, the 2021/2022 Executive committed to the project of democratic reform and struck this Committee. The Committee was composed of three students at large, five councilors, three non-voting CUSA Staff, one volunteer notetaker, and one member of the CUSA Executive. 

The Committee began by consulting with John McNair, CUSA&#x27;s lawyer, who answered questions from Committee members about the state of CUSA&#x27;s Governance. Mr. McNair&#x27;s testimony reinforced the harsh reality: CUSA&#x27;s bylaws and governing structures were seriously flawed and vulnerable to malicious lawsuits to the detriment of CUSA and the student body. Mr. McNair&#x27;s testimony emphasized the urgent need for full and total reform of CUSA governing structures – not only because reform would improve CUSA&#x27;s democratic functioning, but because such modifications were vital to the sustenance of CUSA as an organization. 

Following Mr. McNair&#x27;s interview, the Committee invited witnesses and guests with personal experience working in select fields pertinent to the Committee&#x27;s mandate, or who were known to have institutional knowledge that could be especially worthy of the Committee&#x27;s time. Invited witnesses and guests include: current and former CUSA full-time staff (including a former CUSA executive), current and the most recent former executives, current and former student leaders from recently reformed students&#x27; associations in Ontario were invited, and consultants from the student union movement in the United Kingdom were invited. All witnesses were agreed upon by Committee members in earlier Committee meetings.

The Committee also organized four public forums for students-at-large to raise any questions, comments, or concerns regarding reforms to CUSA&#x27;s governance and elections systems. Students had a wide variety of concerns, comments, and suggestions for Committee members to consider; however, the Committee noticed there were a few issues with wide-spread support. The Committee noted: 

* Students were generally opposed to the slate system and were concerned about the hiring process of CUSAs Electoral Officers. 
* CUSA struggles to provide clear communication to students about opportunities and operations. 
* A series of former Electoral Officers also gave testimonies (requesting for anonymity for the sake of their well-being), most of whom vividly described the hate and vitriol received during their time in office and recommended that Electoral Officers not be selected from the student body.

===== Summary of Recommendations by the Democratic Reform Committee =====

* Recommendation One: As such, the Committee recommends that Council vote to endorse a merger of the Carleton University Students&#x27; Association (&quot;the Association&quot;) and CUSA, Inc. (&quot;the Corporation&quot;).
* Recommendation Two: The Committee recommends the creation and implementation of a well recruited, dutifully selected, properly trained, and expertly advised independent Board of Directors composed of 8 students-at-large and the CUSA President to focus on protecting the long-term future of CUSA from a financial, legal, and reputational perspective.
* Recommendation Three: The Committee further recommends modifications to the voting rights, selection process, legal responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms as described above, of: CUSA President/Chief Executive Officer; CUSA Vice Presidents; and CUSA Councillors
* Recommendation Four: The Committee recommends the roles of executives become full-time at 35 hours per week.
* Recommendation Five: The Committee recommends that only the President and CUSA Councillors be elected in at-large elections, with Vice Presidents selected in processes determined by CUSA council.
* Recommendation Six: The committee recommends that limits be placed on how and when CUSA Executives are able to serve more than one term, including options such as nonconsecutive term limits, a limit of one term as an executive, or a &quot;move up or move out&quot; philosophy engrained in the CUSA Bylaws. 

Out of these 6 recommendations, only Recommendation Four was met with a serious debate from the 2021/2022 CUSA Council. The end result of the debate was to designate the President&#x27;s role as a full-time position for the entirety of the governance year, with the Vice Presidents working full-time (35 hours/week) during the summer &amp; part-time (25 hours/week) during the academic year. While the President&#x27;s role requires a 35 hour/week commitment throughout governance year, the role may take a limited number of courses - pertaining to approval by the CUSA Board. 

==== CUSA Board ====
The CUSA Board holds responsibility for the long-term financial, legal, and reputational position of the corporation. As a Not-For-Profit Corporation, the CUSA Board is subject to all relevant principles and policies of the Ontario government, provincial law, and the Articles of Incorporation. To ensure ethical fiscal management within CUSA operations &amp; strategy, all members of the Board hold a fiduciary responsibility towards the organization.

Composition of the CUSA Board

# 8 student-at-large directors 
# The CUSA President (ex-officio)
# The CUSA Vice President Finance/Secretary-Treasurer (ex-officio, non-voting)

Eligibility to be a Director

# Be a current Carleton Undergraduate student at the time of application, intending on remaining a Carleton Undergraduate student for the duration of the term of appointment
# Directors may not be employees of CUSA, unless occupying ex-officio positions (President/CEO, VP Finance/Secretary-Treasurer)
# Directors may not be sitting CUSA councillors, or CUSA councillors within the most recent academic year
# Directors may not be former CUSA executives
# Board Members may not maintain or hold fiduciary responsibility to another entity that could conceivably regularly conflict with their fiduciary responsibility to CUSA while a member of the Board.
# Directors shall not serve more than four calendar years on the CUSA Board.

Ascension to the Board

# Candidates for the board shall be reviewed and selected by the CUSA Board Nominating and Appointing Committee for ratification by CUSA Council
# CUSA Council will then vote to ratify or deny the selection
# All applicants so ratified will immediately ascend to the CUSA Board

Primary Responsibilities

# Inform strategic direction and organizational growth
# Provide oversight and accountability for the organization
# Monitor policies, procedures, and processes of decision making and resource allocation
# Approve the budget every year
# Comply with the Not-For-Profit Corporations Act (2010)

==== CUSA Council ====
With changes in the governance of the organization, the CUSA Council now holds responsibility for hiring Vice Presidents and appointing the Board of Directors. The Council operates as a deciding body for the association&#x27;s day-to-day business, holding power on advocacy &amp; accountability actions of the Executive team, with a stronger emphasis on Presidential accountability as the President is the only elected body. The Vice Presidents work as &quot;hired officers&quot; of the association, accountable to the council &amp; the board. Since the positions for Vice Presidents are no longer elected by students-at-large, per the Ontario Not For Profit Corporations Act (2010), they are not allowed to hold voting powers in the council and their seats were converted to student representative seats allocated on the basis of enrolment in the academic faculty. 

==== CUSA Executives ====
Per the new governance structure, the President is now the only position elected by students-at-large. To optimize governance &amp; operations, the roles of Vice Presidents were redefined, with much of their power dispersed to other check-and-balance bodies within CUSA. The change in governance and organization hierarchy led to the determination that the positions of Vice Presidents should be selected, elected, and appointed by the CUSA Council after the CUSA General Election. To ensure organizational efficiency, the CUSA President&#x27;s role was determined and changed to be a full-time role that requires a 35 hours/week commitment with due responsibility and accountability to the CUSA Board of Directors, CUSA Council, and the Not For Profit Corporations Act (2010).

== Elections ==
CUSA holds general elections every year with by-elections held every October. With the land-slide win of a &quot;No Confidence&quot; vote in the 2022 CUSA General Elections &amp; its consequent nullification due to the instant-runoff voting system, the association soon after reformed its electoral code. The association now uses the single transferable vote system. The association has been holding online elections since 2014. Voter turnout in 2017 was over 37%. The voter turnout in the 2024 General Elections was 19.8%.

===2025 CUSA Elections===

The Carleton University Students’ Association (CUSA) held its presidential election for the 2025-2026 term from February 4 to February 6, with undergraduate students voting through a ranked ballot system. Three candidates—Nagam Abuihmaid, Chas Nuhn, and Sean Joe-Ezigbo—competed for the position, each presenting distinct policy priorities and financial strategies.

Abuihmaid, a third-year neuroscience student, campaigned on improving CUSA transparency, advocating for better public transit connections, and developing a CUSA mobile app. She emphasized the need for direct campus bus routes, streamlined communication with student clubs, and increased student awareness of CUSA services.

Nuhn, a third-year public affairs and policy management (PAPM) student, focused on reducing student costs by proposing CUSA’s withdrawal from the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), lowering CUSA executive salaries by $5000 each, increasing free printing from 100 to 150 pages per student, donating additional wieghts and ropes to the Carleton University gym and developing a student phone plan. He also proposed the creation of the/a University Network for Inclusion, Training and Yoth (UNITY) Hub to support marginalized students who feel excluded at Carleton University and to enhance leadership training for all CUSA Club executives.

Joe-Ezigbo, a fourth-year commerce student and former CUSA vice president (finance), centered his campaign on financial reform. He advocated for a levy review, summer operational adjustments for CUSA businesses, and the creation of an off-campus housing support centre. He also proposed survivor-centric sexual violence support and parking reimbursements for students with accessibility needs.

During a debate held on January 28, candidates discussed transit advocacy, student engagement, and CUSA’s financial challenges, including its $1.2 million budget deficit. While all three candidates supported reducing OC Transpo U-Pass fees, they differed on approaches to CUSA’s finances. Joe-Ezigbo and Abuihmaid supported a student levy increase, while Nuhn expressed concerns about charging students more money despite acknowledging CUSA’s financial struggles.

The election results have not yet been announced.

===2024 CUSA Elections===

The Carleton University Students’ Association (CUSA) held its presidential election for the 2024-2025 term from February 6 to February 8, with undergraduate students voting through a ranked ballot system, with Sarah El Fitori elected as CUSA President. Despite Sean Joe-Ezigbo leading in first-round votes, El Fitori secured victory in the final round with 2,017 votes (52.4%), defeating Joe-Ezigbo, who received 1,832 votes (47.6%).

The election saw a voter turnout of 19.8%, a significant increase from the previous year’s 13.4%. According to CUSA’s electoral code, votes were counted using the Hare Quota, and eliminated candidates had their votes transferred to remaining contenders in subsequent rounds. The final elimination order was Burte Ariunbold (Round 2), Finlay Maroney (Round 3), Kamran Azizli (Round 4), and Sean Joe-Ezigbo (Round 5).

In addition to the presidential race, all five referendum questions passed, including the creation of an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion levy, a First-year Transition levy, and an increase to the Clubs and Societies levy. Students also voted to remove the Millennium Promise and World Food Programme fees.

The results were announced on February 12, 2024, at Ollie’s Pub and Patio, a CUSA-owned venue. 27 councillors were also elected across various faculties, and El Fitori began her term on May 1, 2024, alongside the newly selected vice-presidents.

==Controversies==

===Abortion rights===
On December 5, 2006, CUSA voted 26-25-1-1 (26 in favour, 25 against, 1 abstaining, 1 absent) of supporting abortion rights, and discontinuing anti-abortion activism. This drew critical reactions from anti-abortion groups and from campus groups, such as the Carleton University Debating Society, that said CUSA was stifling open debate. Those in favour of the motion defended it as ensuring &quot;women&#x27;s rights&quot; on campus. This vote was reversed in December 2012.

===Shinerama cystic fibrosis fundraising controversy===
In November 2008, the CUSA voted to drop its annual Shinerama cystic fibrosis fundraiser, in favour of a fundraiser for an as-yet-undetermined charity, because the illness is not &quot;inclusive&quot; enough. Shinerama is a fundraiser held at universities across Canada every fall in support of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF), first held in 1961; Carleton has participated for the past 25 years and has contributed nearly $1 million to the cause.

Donnie Northrup, CUSA councillor representing the Faculty of Science, introduced the motion which stated that cystic fibrosis &quot;has been recently revealed to only affect white people, and primarily men&quot; and that therefore, it was inappropriate for the CUSA to donate money to researching a cure. Supporters of the motion argued that &quot;all orientees and volunteers should feel like their fundraising efforts will serve diverse communities.&quot;

====Reactions and Criticism====
The CUSA was criticized for this decision since the motion did not reveal the source of the claim that cystic fibrosis affects only Caucasians. In fact, the CCFF&#x27;s website states that: &quot;The disease is most common in caucasians, but it can affect all races.&quot; Nick Bergamini, a CUSA council member who represents Journalism students, stated that &quot;They&#x27;re playing racial politics with something that is supposed to bring people together – a charity.&quot; Bergamini commented that &quot;they see this, in their own twisted way, as a win for diversity. I see it as a loss for people with cystic fibrosis.&quot;

Cathleen Morrison, who is the CEO of the CCFF, stated in an interview with CTV News that although cystic fibrosis &quot;does affect Caucasian populations primarily,&quot; the term Caucasian includes people from South Asia, North Africa, the Persian Gulf and Israel. Morrison explained that &quot;These are Caucasian populations. These people do not have white skin. They have CF, it now seems, in the same ratios as other Caucasian people who do have white skin.&quot; Morrison also stated that cystic fibrosis affects just as many young girls as boys.

Jonathan Kay, a columnist for the &quot;National Post&quot;, blasted CUSA for this decision. Kay stated that &quot;Even by the loopy standards of students governments, this has got to be a new low.&quot; Kay argued that cystic fibrosis, although it has a much higher rate of occurrence in caucasian males, affects all races and both genders. Kay also pointed out that many charity events raise money for breast cancer, even though it is primarily a female disease, and for Tay–Sachs disease, whose sufferers are almost exclusively Jewish. Editorial and opinion articles from the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; have also condemned CUSA&#x27;s actions with the editorial declaring that &quot;when [a student association] does something as ignorant and thoughtless as Carleton University&#x27;s did this week, the country pays attention.&quot;

====Subsequent response by CUSA====
CUSA president Brittany Smyth later stated that the council has been considering rotating the beneficiary of Shinerama instead of always giving the money to one charity, arguing that &quot;It&#x27;s about people wanting to do something different.&quot; Smyth said the colour of someone&#x27;s skin wasn&#x27;t at issue; rather, the decision was made to spread the university&#x27;s fundraising efforts to other charities. In an interview with CTV news, Smyth stated that &quot;There was some discussion about that issue but very small. Most of it was around just switching it up and doing something different for a change.&quot;

CUSA released a statement on November 26 indicating that the association&#x27;s council would revisit their decision. Smyth stated, &quot;It has become clear that there is not an appetite at Carleton to change from [Shinerama]... The responsible thing to do is to reverse the decision,&quot; adding that &quot;the motion was never meant to imply that raising funds for Cystic Fibrosis research was not a worthwhile cause.&quot; Smyth announced an emergency meeting of CUSA&#x27;s council to vote on a new motion to reinstate the charity. A unanimous vote at that meeting revoked the earlier decision, approved the restoration of next year&#x27;s Shinerama campaign and also approved the publication of an apology over the matter. Donnie Northrup, the council representative responsible for moving the original motion to cancel Shinerama, resigned his position at CUSA as did another councillor, Sean Maguire. However, over the summer of 2009 Northrup was acclaimed back into CUSA. The meeting also received petitions demanding the resignation of Smyth and certain other councillors, although no actions on these were immediately taken.

===Disqualification of a President-Elect===

On February 13, 2009, Bruce Kyereh-Addo of the Demand Better slate was found to be in violation of the Consolidated Electoral Code on multiple counts and subsequently disqualified. To date, Kyereh-Addo&#x27;s disqualification was upheld by the electoral board.

=== 2009 CFS referendum petition ===
During the 2009–2010 school year, a group of students launched a petition to hold a referendum on possible disaffiliation of CUSA from the CFS. Stated reasoning for this referendum was to counter issues such as the claimed ineffectiveness of the CFS and interference in other university&#x27;s unions. In a press release the petitioners stated that the CFS &quot;made almost no gains as a lobby group in its 30 years of operation.&quot; This was strongly denied by the CFS.

After several weeks a counter petition was created to try to bar the issue from going to a university-wide vote, which was controversially spearheaded by several CUSA officials. Soon afterward CUSA officially endorsed the counter-petition by a vote of 17 in favour, 7 against and 9 abstaining. The motion also mandates that CUSA members must advocate in favour of the CFS. This has attracted more criticism toward CUSA by students who feel it should stay neutral and instead try to help students make an informed decision. The pro-referendum petition ended up garnering over 2300 signatures before its submission to the CFS offices in Toronto. Despite being hand-delivered by a Bailiff, the CFS have stated they did not receive the petition. A referendum at Carleton had previously been held in 1995, on the possibility of joining the newly formed Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA), that lost narrowly.

===Disqualification of VP Student Services===
In 2016, Ashley Courchene, a third year political science major, ran for Vice President Student Services under the slate Change. After winning the election by only 21 votes, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Matt Swain disqualified the Change slate due to an alleged infraction by the assistant campaign manager Ahmad Gitteh and presidential candidate Abdullah Jabber, which led to Ashley Courchene&#x27;s disqualification. Mr. Courchene successfully appealed the disqualification to the Electoral Board. Your Carleton then successfully appealed to the Constitutional Board (which overrides the electoral board). Mr. Courchene then went to the Ontario Superior Court, which reinstated him to the position of VPSS. Neither CUSA nor Your Carleton appealed the court&#x27;s decision.

<text>The University of Ottawa Students&#x27; Union, commonly referred to as the UOSU (; &quot;SÉUO&quot;) is the student organization representing undergraduate students of the University of Ottawa. It is the successor organization of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa following its dissolution in 2019 after a referendum between the two was given to students.

== History ==
=== Student Federation of the University of Ottawa ===

The SFUO represented University of Ottawa undergraduate students from 1969 to 2018. It was a not-for-profit organization, incorporated under the Ontario &quot;Corporations&#x27; Act&quot;. On August 9, 2018, La Rotonde, the university&#x27;s French-language newspaper, reported that the Ottawa Police Service was investigating members of the SFUO and its executive for fraud. Subsequently, on August 10, the university announced it was withholding their funding until an audit into the allegations could be completed. Due to fraud and embezzlement allegations, the University of Ottawa announced that it would terminate its agreement with SFUO.

On September 25, 2018, the University of Ottawa provided the Federation with a 90-day notice of termination of their contract, citing insufficient progress and further allegations of workplace misconduct, internal conflict, and improper governance. The announcement noted that, as of December 24th, 2018, the Federation would no longer be recognized as the official representative of students, and invited students who wished to establish successor organizations to come forward.

The SFUO offices closed on April 10, 2019. An equitable court receiver was appointed to officially dissolve the federation.

Notable past presidents of the organization included Marcel Prud&#x27;homme (1958–59), André Ouellet (1959–60), Allan Rock (1969–70), Hugh Segal (1970–71), Denis Paradis (1974–75), Mauril Bélanger (1977–79), Anne McGrath (1979–80), Bernard Drainville (1984–85), Gilles Marchildon (1987–88), Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin (1990–91) and Guy Caron (1992–94).

=== Founding and subsequent history ===

To determine whether or not the SFUO could remain in place, the university organized a referendum on which organization should represent undergraduate students. The newly-organized University of Ottawa Students&#x27; Union ran on decreasing politicization, increasing student power, and decreasing centralization within the Union. Meanwhile, the SFUO believed that it was best positioned to maintain the services and resources that students had access to. UOSU won the referendum overwhelmingly.

The University then signed a new agreement with UOSU, outlining additional oversight and financial transparency measures, and recognizing it as the sole voice of undergraduate students at the University.

In 2020, the position of President was established, with Babacar Faye as its inaugural office holder.

== Governance ==
The University of Ottawa Students&#x27; Union is a not-for-profit organization, incorporated in Canadian corporate law under the &quot;Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act&quot;. The organization itself is governed by its Constitution, which establishes its political apparatus and component organs.

=== General Assembly ===

The General Assembly is the highest governing body within UOSU and is composed of all of the members of the Union. The General Assembly meets twice annually, once in the fall and winter semesters, respectively. Except as limited by the Constitution, the GA may pass resolutions that bind the Board and Executive Committee. The GA has authority over amending UOSU&#x27;s Constitution.

=== Board of Directors ===

The Board of Directors governs and provides oversight to UOSU. It comprises 30 members that serve 1-year terms: a President, 6 Commissioners, 22 Directors elected from their faculties, and 1 Indigenous Director, elected through the Indigenous Students&#x27; Association. Each faculty has between 1 and 5 Directors.

There is a public Board meeting session held every month; much of its responsibilities are delegated to various committees, which are either enshrined in the organization&#x27;s constitution or formed as ad hoc committees, each focusing on a specific field or area of concern.

=== Executive Committee ===
The Executive Committee (EXEC) manages the day-to-day operations of UOSU, with specific jurisdiction over human resources and signing contracts. The EC comprises 7 undergraduate students: the President, and six Commissioners. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific aspect of the organization. They include the Equity, Francophone Affairs, Student Life, Advocacy, Operations, and Communications Commissioners.


=== Elections ===
General elections are held during the Winter term, either in February or March, to elect the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. By-elections are held in October to fill vacant director and executive positions.

==== 2024 ====
General elections 

General elections were held on February 18, 2024. Turnout was 6.74%. President Delphine Robitaille was re-elected unopposed. The Interim Equity Commissioner, Imani Bunzigiye, was elected to a full term, and Interim Francophone Affairs Commissioner was defeated by Daphnée Veilleux-Michaud. 3 Executive positions were left vacant: Student Life, Communications, and Advocacy Commissioner.

On May 6, 2024, the UOSU Board of Directors hired Greg Coleman as Operations Commissioner and Sanjida Flora as Advocacy Commissioner.

By-elections

2024 by-elections concluded October 14, 2024 with 8.47% voter turnout, the highest for a by-election in the union’s short history. Three members were elected to the UOSU executive committee: Anne Hyppolite as communications commissioner, Alex Stratas as advocacy commissioner, and Emilia Bah as student life commissioner, all pending ratification. Voting, originally scheduled for five days, was extended by two days due to an issue that temporarily limited the ability of co-op students to vote. 

==== 2023 ====

===== General elections =====
General elections were held from March 5–9, 2023. Turnout was 3.8%. Only 1 Executive Position was contested, with Joyce Williams being elected Equity Commissioner with 51.7% of the vote. The Operations and Advocacy Commissioners were elected unopposed. Faculty Directors were elected.

===== By-elections =====
By-elections were held from October 9–14, 2023. Turnout was 7.7%. The positions of President, Student Life Commissioner, Francophone Affairs Commissioner and Communications Commissioner were filled. Additionally, 5 Director seats and 3 Senate seats were filled.

Students voted in 10 referendums during the by-elections. 9 of them passed, including an 11% reduction in Union fees, resulting in a $500,000 cut to its budget.

== Clubs and Student Governments ==

=== Clubs ===
The organization recognizes over 360 different clubs and associations related to all aspects of student life, from powerlifting to chess to politics.

=== Recognized Student Governments ===
Recognized Student Governments (RSGs) are autonomous, but affiliated organizations representing students from different undergraduate programs. UOSU recognizes 25 RSGs and funds them on a per-student basis.

==Businesses and services==
The SFUO, and subsequently the UOSU after it succeeded them, operates businesses and offers services that students and/or members of the public can access.

== Controversies ==

=== uOttawa Students for Life ===
In 2019, uOttawa Students for Life (UOSFL), a club that advocated against abortion rights on campus, received provisional club status, giving them funding from UOSU and the right to book spaces on campus, sparking controversy. A special General Assembly meeting was called when a petition demanding the Union remove club status from UOSFL and adopt a pro-choice stance was signed by 500 students and presented to the Union. The meeting failed to reach quorum. In January 2020, the Board of Directors stripped UOSFL of club status.

=== CHUO-FM referendum ===
During the October 2023 by-elections, UOSU members voted to eliminate a tuition levy that funded CHUO-FM, a local campus radio station. The levy was set at $4.99 per student, which accounted for between $360,000–$380,000 of annual funding, or around 80% of its total funding. The radio station criticized the decision, saying their survival was at risk, and the referendum was legally questionable.

At the General Assembly meeting following the referendum, the referendum was not ratified after the Board received legal advice to reject it. According to President-elect Delphine Robitaille, it would have been a &quot;legal liability.&quot; There is no similar precedent for not ratifying referendum results. During the 2024 general elections, the referendum was approved again.

=== 2024-2025 service cuts ===
Following the Fall 2023 Elections, UOSU members approved a referendum forcing a 11.37 percent cut to UOSU student fees in the 2024-2025 school year. In part due to these cuts, UOSU&#x27;s Budget 2024-2025 included the defunding and dissolution of four services: the Bilingualism Centre, the Peer Help Centre, Foot Patrol, and the Multifaith Centre. On June 24, 2024, the Francophone Affairs Commissioner, Daphnée Veilleux-Michaud, held an emergency meeting open to the public regarding the proposed closure of the Bilingualism Centre. A number of students, including club and student association executives attended the meeting. Operations Commissioner Greg Coleman, who had written the budget with UOSU President Delphine Robitaille, was the only Board member to at the meeting other than Veilleux-Michaud. Reporters from the French-language student newspaper, La Rotonde, and a member from the student radio CHUO-FM were also present. 

After the emergency meeting, Francophone students who felt that the budget cuts unfairly targeted them joined the Francophone Affairs Commissioner in writing an open letter, which was published in La Rotonde, criticizing the proposal. In particular, they felt the UOSU was putting Bike Co-op before them and suggested that this service should perhaps be defunded instead. Coincidentally, in The Fulcrum&#x27;s article on the passage of the budget, an Anglophone Board of Directors member representing the Faculty of Social Sciences, James Adair, and the Operations Commissioner are pictured to the right of the President with Bike Co-op branded water bottles.

After the passage of the budget, La Rotonde published an article criticizing the outcome, calling into question the May 1 salary increase of UOSU executives to $23 per hour, and again suggesting that the Bike Co-op should have been cut instead. Less than a week later on July 6, La Rotonde published another open letter to the UOSU President, insisting that the budget included cuts to the Feminist Resource Centre that constituted &quot;anti-femenist intellectual harassment.&quot; However, no cuts aimed at this service were included in the 2024-2025 budget.

<doc id="1163586" wikidata="Q550521" url="?curid=1163586" title="Chester Himes">
<text>Chester Bomar Himes (July 29, 1909 – November 12, 1984) was an American writer. His works, some of which have been filmed, include &quot;If He Hollers Let Him Go&quot;, published in 1945, and the &quot;Harlem Detective&quot; series of novels for which he is best known, set in the 1950s and early 1960s and featuring two black policemen called Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson. In 1958, Himes won France&#x27;s Grand Prix de Littérature Policière.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Chester Himes was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, on July 29, 1909, to Joseph Sandy Himes and Estelle Bomar Himes; his father was a professor of industrial trades at a black college, and his mother, prior to getting married, was a teacher at Scotia Seminary. Chester Himes grew up in a middle-class home in Missouri. When he was about 12 years old, his father took a teaching job in the Arkansas Delta at Branch Normal College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), and soon a tragedy took place that would profoundly shape Himes&#x27;s view of race relations. He had misbehaved and his mother made him sit out a gunpowder demonstration that he and his brother, Joseph Jr., were supposed to conduct during a school assembly. Working alone, Joseph mixed the chemicals; they exploded in his face. Rushed to the nearest hospital, the blinded boy was refused treatment because of Jim Crow laws. &quot;That one moment in my life hurt me as much as all the others put together&quot;, Himes wrote in his autobiography &quot;The Quality of Hurt&quot;.

The family later settled in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents&#x27; marriage was unhappy and eventually ended in divorce.

=== Prison and literary beginnings ===
In 1925, Himes&#x27;s family left Pine Bluff and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended East High School. He attended The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, but was expelled for playing a prank. In late 1928, he was arrested and sentenced to jail and hard labor for 20 to 25 years for armed robbery and sent to Ohio Penitentiary. In prison, he wrote short stories and had them published in national magazines. He stated that writing in prison and being published was a way to earn respect from guards and fellow inmates, as well as to avoid violence.

His first stories appeared in 1931 in &quot;The Bronzeman&quot; and, starting in 1934, in &quot;Esquire&quot;. His story &quot;To What Red Hell&quot; (published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1934) as well as to his novel &quot;Cast the First Stone&quot; – only much later republished unabridged as &quot;Yesterday Will Make You Cry&quot; (1998) – dealt with the catastrophic prison fire Himes witnessed at Ohio Penitentiary in 1930.

In 1934, Himes was transferred to London Prison Farm and in April 1936 was released on parole into his mother&#x27;s custody. Following his release, he worked at part-time jobs while continuing to write. During this period, he came into contact with Langston Hughes, who facilitated Himes&#x27;s entree into the world of literature and publishing.

In 1937, Himes married Jean Johnson.

=== First books ===
In the 1940s, Himes spent time in Los Angeles, working as a screenwriter but also producing two novels, &quot;If He Hollers Let Him Go&quot; (1945) and &quot;Lonely Crusade&quot; (1947), which charted the experiences of the great migration, drawn by the city&#x27;s defense industries, and their dealings with the established black community, fellow workers, unions and management. He also provided an analysis of the Zoot Suit Riots for &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the magazine of the NAACP.

Mike Davis in &quot;City of Quartz: Excavating the Future of Los Angeles&quot;, describing the prevalence of racism in Hollywood in the 1940s and &#x27;50s, cites Himes&#x27; brief career as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers, terminated when Jack L. Warner heard about him and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want no niggers on this lot.&quot; Himes later wrote in his autobiography:

Back on the East Coast Himes received a scholarship at the Yaddo artists&#x27; community, where he stayed and worked in May and June 1948, in a room opposite Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s.

=== Emigration to France ===
Himes separated from his wife, Jean, in 1952, and the following year he began a period of travels by boarding a ship to France. By the 1950s, he had decided to settle permanently in France, a country he liked in part due to his popularity in literary circles. In Paris, Himes was friends with his contemporaries; the political cartoonist Oliver Harrington and fellow expatriate writers Richard Wright, James Baldwin and William Gardner Smith.

In Paris in the late 1950s Chester met his second wife, Lesley Packard, when she interviewed him for the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;; she wrote a fashion column there under the name of &quot;Monica&quot;. He described her as &quot;Irish-English with blue-gray eyes and very good looking&quot;; he also saw her courage and resilience, Chester said to Lesley: &quot;You&#x27;re the only true color-blind person I&#x27;ve ever met in my life.&quot; After he suffered a stroke, in 1959, Lesley quit her job and nursed him back to health. She cared for him for the rest of his life, and worked with him as his informal editor, proofreader, confidante and, as the director Melvin Van Peebles dubbed her, &quot;his watchdog&quot;. After a long engagement, they were married in 1978, as Chester Himes was still legally married to his first wife, Jean, and only able to gain a divorce that year.

Lesley and Chester faced adversities as a mixed-race couple but they prevailed. Their circle of political colleagues and creative friends included towering figures Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Malcolm X, Carl Van Vechten, Picasso, Jean Miotte, Ollie Harrington, Nikki Giovanni, Ishmael Reed and John A. Williams. Williams based the main character of his 1967 novel &quot;The Man Who Cried I Am&quot; on Himes. Bohemian life in Paris would in turn lead Lesley and Chester to the South of France and finally on to Spain, where they lived until Chester&#x27;s death in 1984.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1969, Himes moved to Moraira, Spain, where he died in 1984 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, at the age of 75. He is buried at Benissa cemetery.

== Critical reception and biography ==

Some regard Chester Himes as the literary equal of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Ishmael Reed says: &quot;[Himes] taught me the difference between a black detective and Sherlock Holmes&quot; and it would be more than 30 years until another black mystery writer, Walter Mosley and his Easy Rawlins and Mouse series, had even a similar effect. S. A. Cosby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; also positively compared Himes to Chandler and Hammett, enjoying his writing of the &quot;Black experience&quot; and skepticism regarding the American Dream. Cosby also opined that Himes&#x27; works influenced future writers and cited his Harlem cycle as being among his favorite work.

In 1996, Himes&#x27;s widow Lesley Himes went to New York to work with Ed Margolies on the first biographical treatment of Himes&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;The Several Lives of Chester Himes&quot;, by long-time Himes scholars Edward Margolies and Michel Fabre, published in 1997 by University Press of Mississippi. Later, novelist and Himes scholar James Sallis published a more deeply detailed biography of Himes called &quot;Chester Himes: A Life&quot; (2000).

A detailed examination of Himes&#x27;s writing and writings about him can be found in &quot;Chester Himes: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography&quot; compiled by Michel Fabre, Robert E. Skinner, and Lester Sullivan (Greenwood Press, 1992).
In 2017, Lawrence P. Jackson published a significant biography of Himes, more than 600 pages in length, titled &quot;Chester B. Himes: A Biography&quot;. Reviewing the biography for &quot;Johns Hopkins Magazine&quot;, Bret McCabe noted it makes the case that while &quot;[Himes&#x27;s] debut, &quot;If He Hollers Let Him Go&quot; (1945), is as admired today as it was in its time[...] its follow-up, &quot;Lonely Crusade&quot; (1947), is overlooked and underappreciated, and positions it as a key text in reckoning both Himes&#x27;s subsequent career and later works.&quot;

==Works==
Himes&#x27;s novels encompassed many genres including the crime novel/mystery and political polemics, exploring racism in the United States.

Chester Himes wrote about African Americans in general, especially in two books that are concerned with labor relations and African-American workplace issues. &quot;If He Hollers Let Him Go&quot;—which contains many autobiographical elements—is about a black shipyard worker in Los Angeles during World War II struggling against racism, as well as his own violent reactions to racism. &quot;Lonely Crusade&quot; is a longer work that examines some of the same issues.

&quot;Cast the First Stone&quot; (1952) is based on Himes&#x27;s experiences in prison. It was Himes&#x27;s first novel but was not published until about ten years after it was written. One reason may have been Himes&#x27;s unusually candid treatment – for that time – of a homosexual relationship. Originally written in the third person, it was rewritten in the first person in a more &quot;hard-boiled&quot; style. &quot;Yesterday Will Make You Cry&quot; (1993), published after Himes&#x27;s death, restored the original manuscript. The restored 1998 edition includes a 1997 introduction by filmmaker and writer Melvin Van Peebles.

Himes also wrote a series of Harlem Detective novels featuring Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones, New York City police detectives in Harlem. The novels feature a mordant emotional timbre and a fatalistic approach to street situations. Funeral homes are often part of the story, and funeral director H. Exodus Clay is a recurring character in these books.

The titles of the series include &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot;, &quot;The Real Cool Killers&quot;, &quot;The Crazy Kill&quot;, &quot;All Shot Up&quot;, &quot;The Big Gold Dream&quot;, &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot;, &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot;, and &quot;Blind Man with a Pistol&quot;; all written between 1957 and 1969. The final entry in the series was to be &quot;Plan B&quot;, published posthumously in 1983.

&quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; was made into a movie in 1970, which was set in that time period, rather than the earlier period of the original book. A sequel, &quot;Come Back, Charleston Blue&quot;, based upon &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot;, was released in 1972. &quot;For Love of Imabelle&quot; was made into a film under the title &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot; in 1991. In the 1980s, British publisher Allison and Busby reprinted several of the Harlem detective novels in editions that featured paintings by Edward Burra on the covers.

In May 2011, and again in 2020 Penguin Modern Classics in London republished five of Himes&#x27;s detective novels from the Harlem Cycle. The literary estate is overseen by Chester and Lesley&#x27;s &quot;niece&quot; Sarah Pirozek (daughter of Lesley&#x27;s best and oldest friend).

Two Himes short stories &quot;The Assassin of Saint Nicholas Avenue&quot; and &quot;Tang&quot; have also been filmed as short subjects, the latter included as a segment in the 1994 anthology television film &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Himes was Catholic, but professed to be &quot;not a good one&quot;. At the time of his death in Moraira, he was married to Lesley Himes (née Packard), his partner, confidant, and informal editor, since 1959.

<text>Afgekia is a small genus of large perennial climbing shrubs native to Thailand in Asia, belonging to the family Fabaceae. They are reminiscent of the related genus &quot;Wisteria&quot;.

==Description==
The two species of &quot;Afgekia&quot; are scrambling climbers, reaching high. The mature stems are brown. The leaves are evergreen and generally have 8–16 paired leaflets plus a terminal leaflet. The leaflets are long by wide. The erect inflorescence is a leafy raceme, long. The individual flowers are long and have the general shape of members of the subfamily Faboideae. The standard petal is long by wide, cream in colour with pale pink to purple markings and a pale or dark yellow or greenish nectar guide. The deep pink or purple wing petals are more or less equal in length to the keel at long by wide, with short basal claws. The white keel petals are long by wide. Nine of the stamens are fused together, the other is free; all curve upwards at the apex. The inflated seed pods are long by wide, splitting when ripe to release the 2 or 3 seeds.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Afgekia&quot; was established by William Grant Craib in 1927, initially with one species, &quot;Afgekia sericea&quot;. The genus name commemorates Arthur Francis George Kerr, being formed from his initials. Kerr was an Irish physician and pioneering botanist in Thailand in the early twentieth century. The type specimen of &quot;Afgekia sericea&quot; was collected by Kerr&#x27;s Thai associate Anuwat.

A 2019 molecular phylogenetic study showed that one of the species then placed in &quot;Afgekia&quot; (&quot;A. filipes&quot;, now &quot;Padbruggea filipes&quot;) did not belong in the genus, but that the remaining two species formed a well separated clade, sister to &quot;Kanburia&quot;, in turn forming a larger clade with &quot;Callerya&quot;, &quot;Serawaia&quot; and &quot;Whitfordiodendron&quot;. Morphological characters that distinguish &quot;Afgekia&quot; from other genera include two rather than one pair of callosities on the standard petal and the longest stipules and floral bracts in the tribe Wisterieae.

===Species===
, Plants of the World Online accepted two species:
* &quot;Afgekia mahidoliae&quot; 
* &quot;Afgekia sericea&quot;

<text>The RBC Taylor Prize (2000–2020), formerly known as the Charles Taylor Prize, was a Canadian literary award, presented by the Charles Taylor Foundation to the best Canadian work of literary non-fiction. It was named for Charles P. B. Taylor, a noted Canadian historian and writer. Instituted in 2000, the 2020 prize was the final year the prize was awarded. The prize was originally presented every two years until 2004, and became an annual award from 2004 onwards. The monetary value of the award increased over the years. The final award in 2020 had a monetary value of $30,000.

The award adopted its present name in December 2013, when RBC Wealth Management was announced as the new corporate sponsor. In addition, under RBC&#x27;s sponsorship the award added a second $10,000 award for an emerging Canadian literary non-fiction writer between the ages of 18 and 35, to be chosen by the winner of the main award. This award was presented for the first time at the 2014 ceremony.

In 2018 the new RBC Taylor Prize Emerging Writers Mentorship Program was unveiled. This was a professional development program designed to support the next generation of Canadian writers and was part of the RBC Taylor Prize Emerging Writers Award, a distinction that was given annually to a Canadian author whose work embodies the pursuit of excellence in literary non-fiction.

The mentorship program was made available to five Canadian non-fiction writers, who were selected in partnership with a national network of university and college writing programs. These students were paired with the 2018 RBC Taylor Prize shortlisted authors, who would help support their career development and growth.

In 2020, the organizers announced that the 2020 award would be the final presentation of the award.

==Winners and nominees==
==RBC Taylor Emerging Writer Award==
The RBC Taylor Emerging Writer Award was instituted for the first time in 2014. The award was presented to an emerging writer selected by the winner of that year&#x27;s primary award, and consisted of $10,000 and a mentorship from the writer who made the selection.

In 2018, the RBC Taylor Foundation also announced the creation of a mentorship program for writers who had not yet published their first non-fiction manuscript. Five writers would be selected for the mentorship each year, each receiving mentorship from one of the shortlisted main prize authors.

<text>Faith is the third studio album by American country music artist Faith Hill, released in 1998. 

Due to the success of the single &quot;This Kiss&quot; in Australia and the UK, the album was released under the title Love Will Always Win, featuring the title track, a new version of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; and two new versions of &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot;, which replace &quot;You Give Me Love&quot;, &quot;My Wild Frontier&quot;, &quot;Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me&quot; and the original version of &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot;. Other tracks on this album are mixed differently and remove some of the country elements and replacing them with a more pop sound. In some countries, &quot;It Matters to Me&quot;, the title track and hit single from Hill&#x27;s 1995 second album &quot;It Matters to Me&quot;, is also included as a bonus track. 

&quot;Better Days&quot; was previously recorded by Bekka &amp; Billy on their 1997 debut album &quot;Bekka &amp; Billy&quot;. &quot;Love Will Always Win&quot; was later issued as a single by Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood from Brooks&#x27; 2005 album &quot;The Lost Sessions&quot;. &quot;I Love You&quot; was originally recorded by Celine Dion for her 1996 album, &quot;Falling into You&quot;. 

The album was released on April 21, 1998, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. It was certified six-times Platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over six million copies in the United States. Two songs off of the album, &quot;This Kiss&quot; and &quot;Let Me Let Go&quot;, were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance at the 41st and 42nd Annual Grammy Awards respectively.

<text>A marine aquarium is an aquarium that keeps marine plants and animals in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, as a means of more natural biological filtration.

Marine fishkeeping is different from its freshwater counterpart because of the fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants.
== Marine fishkeeping history ==
The first saltwater tanks were Venetian glass jars where the Romans kept anemones outdoors, but these systems were very short lived.

The Aztec Empire had 10 ponds of saltwater aquariums at Texcoco.
In 1846, Anna Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.

Personal saltwater fishkeeping began on a wider scale in the 1950s, starting with the basic rectangular glass aquariums (usually 20 gallon), still popular today. Bleached coral along with a substrate of coarse crushed coral were the norm. Algae, including beneficial types such as coralline algae, were viewed negatively and were generally removed. The clean, sterile tank was viewed as the healthiest.

During the early days of marine aquaria, saltwater was collected at local beaches. Natural saltwater contains many unwanted organisms and pollutants. Aquarium literature of the time suggests that the most commonly kept marine fish were the percula clownfish, sergeant major damselfish, small, brackish-water pufferfish and scats, jeweled blennies, and blue damsels. Aquariums were equipped with large air compressors, and were heavily aerated and filtered (primarily with undergravel filters, a norm for some time).

An ever-growing number of hobbyists experiencing the inconvenience of gathering natural sea water and the concurrent development of analytical chemistry techniques led to research into the chemical composition of sea water. Synthetic salt mixes were developed to replicate the chemical environment of the tropical ocean, including trace elements and salts. This advance made marine fishkeeping popular in areas without access to clean sea water.

Air driven, counter-current protein skimmers and reliable submersible electric heaters were invented in Germany. Various advances in filtration included trickle and hang-on filters, both allowing a more natural equilibrium in the aquarium environment. The advancement of fluorescent lighting technologies to provide higher output, along with metal halide lighting, enabled the first reef tanks, making it possible to keep corals and other invertebrates without natural sunlight.

More efficient chemical testing allowed aquarists to understand the chemical properties of aquariums. By the 1980s, a biologically-based understanding of how to maintain an artificial ocean environment brought more successful and widespread marine fishkeeping.
== Modern fishkeeping ==

=== Marine aquarium components ===

The major components are an aquarium, usually made from glass or acrylic, filtration equipment, lighting, and an aquarium heater. Marine aquariums can range in volume from less than 80 litres, (&lt; 20 US gal) to over 1,200 litres (300 US gal). Small volumes are more difficult to maintain due to the more rapid changes in water chemistry. The majority of saltwater aquariums are between 160 and 400 litres (40 and 100 US gal).
===Types of marine aquariums===
Marine aquarists typically divide saltwater aquariums into those housing fish only, those housing fish with live rock, and those primarily designed to house corals and other invertebrates (also known as reef aquariums). Many fish hobbyists also divide the types of saltwater tanks based on the water temperatures at which they are kept.

====Tropical marine====
The most common type of saltwater fish tank, the tropical marine tank, houses marine animals from tropical climates. Usually kept between 
, these tanks include tropical reef tanks, as well as fish-only tanks. These tanks tend to have a low concentration of microscopic plankton and other foods eaten by filter feeders. Most livestock for these aquariums are acquired through commercial means.

====Temperate marine (coldwater marine)====
One of the more obscure types of fish tanks, the coldwater marine tank, holds fish of temperate climates, with temperatures ranging around . Colorful species such as the ornate cowfish, blennies, and sea anemones can be found. The anemones and invertebrates in temperate waters easily rival their tropical counterparts. Most colorful species are found in the western Pacific and west coast of North America. Maintenance of these tanks is similar to keeping a fish only tank with live rock, or a non-photosynthetic tropical aquarium.

A significant diversity of species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather duster worms. A few corals can be found at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK. The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose behavior patterns and tank compatibilities have been well documented in the last five or six decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them.

Many temperate fish have specific local diet requirements, while others, will eat just about any crustacean or frozen foods. Some fish should not be kept with fish small enough to fit into its mouth, crabs or mollusks. Similarly some crabs can not be kept with some mollusks, while other fish, crabs, mollusks and echinoderms may be compatible with each other. It takes experience before one can successfully gauge the compatibility of the fish and invertebrates in one&#x27;s area. Due to it being such a localized hobby in the United States, not many people go the route of local tanks which are far more popular in Europe.

=== Live rock ===

Live rock is rock that has been in the ocean, composed of limestone and decomposing coral skeleton, usually around a coral reef such as those around Fiji, and is usually covered with beneficial algae, coralline and tiny invertebrates and bacteria that are desirable in the aquarium. Some examples of the microfauna commonly found on live rock are crabs, snails, feather dusters, brittle stars, starfish, limpets, abalones, and an occasional sea urchin, sea anemone, coral, and sea sponge. Also, if the aquarist is unlucky, a mantis shrimp. Bristleworms are also common, most of which, while unattractive, are not harmful and are useful scavengers; some species can be pests, however. The addition of live rock is one of the best ways to ensure a healthy aquarium, as the rock provides a buffer to maintain high pH (8.0-8.3), alkalinity, and acid-neutralizing capacity. Alkalinity is often known by a rather confusing term, &quot;carbonate hardness&quot;, or KH. This is usually measured in &quot;degrees&quot; (dKH) or meq/L.

The microfauna found on live rock are detrivores and herbivores (as they eat algae and fish waste), and provide fish with a natural, attractive shelter. Live rock usually arrives from online dealers as &quot;uncured&quot;, and must be quarantined in a separate tank while undergoing the curing process, which involves the inevitable die-off of some of the rock&#x27;s inhabitants and the subsequent production of undesirable ammonia and nitrite. Live rock that is already cured is available at most pet stores that cater to saltwater. Live sand is similar to live rock and is equally desirable.

Sometimes hobbyists use so-called &quot;dry rock&quot;, which is simply old live rock that has been allowed to dry out and to lose most of its live inhabitants, to keep unwanted pests out of their aquariums, and as an inexpensive alternative to live rock.

=== Filtration ===
In general, marine aquariums have more complex filtration requirements than most freshwater aquariums. The various components frequently include wet and dry filters and protein skimmers. Protein skimmers are devices that remove organic compounds prior to their degradation, and are very useful in marine aquariums. Protein skimming is also used in the popular Berlin method that relies on live rock and periodic partial water changes to degrade and remove waste products. The Berlin method requires large amounts of live rock in the aquarium. The rule of thumb is 1/2–1 lb. per 1 US gallon (0.2–0.4 kg per 4 liters).

Many marine aquariums include a sump, which is an external container connected to the main aquarium with a water pump. In most setups, the sump is located below the aquarium and is fed water from the main tank via an overflow. An overflow at its simplest is a round hole drilled towards the top of the tank, connected via tubing to an output below it. As the water level increases past the height of the overflow (weir), the water &quot;overflows&quot; the tank and falls through to the sump below. It is typical to have tall combs on the overflow edge so fish do not jump inside. The water circulation is powered by a water pump in the sump, which pushes the water up into the tank, thus causing more water to flow over and perpetuating the cycle. There are many advantages to using a sump, both for the appearance and the health of the tank. The sump helps the appearance of the tank, because it allows filtration and maintenance equipment (protein skimmer, heater, activated carbon) to be kept out of sight of the main tank. It also ensures that the water level of the main aquarium never changes, as the overflow sets the water level in the main tank. The sump aids tank health by helping to oxygenate the water by increasing the amount of water/air surface area used for gas exchange.

Some marine aquariums also include a refugium. Refugiums are small containers or aquariums that are hidden behind or beneath the main aquarium and connected to it via a water pump (often in a similar manner to a sump). Refugiums have recently become quite popular among reef aquarists because they can be used to serve several purposes such as adding water volume or providing a fish-free site for biological filtration in live rock and/or the sandbed. Fish-free refugiums host populations of copepods, amphipods, isopods, and other zooplankton.

=== Lighting ===

Regular cyclical lighting is used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them feel more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue.

In marine aquariums containing corals, or other photosynthetic invertebrates, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Since the intensity of the light will vary based on the source and distance from the source, lighting requirements are sometimes described using a measurement called Photosynthetically Available Radiation, or PAR.

Various light sources include but are not limited to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.

====Natural sunlight====
The most primitive lighting source is natural sunlight. This is only effective in areas near the equator because the intensity of sunlight is greatest there. Efficiently utilizing natural sunlight requires complex planning and, as such, this method is applied on only the largest reef systems. Many times in the hobby natural sunlight is actually avoided due to the low spectrum of lighting it has. The yellow tint is often undesirable and is believed to encourage problem algae, though studies show it does not.

====Incandescent====
Incandescent lamps have been phased out over the years. They are wasteful of energy, producing between 15 and 30 lumens per watt of power (out of a possible 683 lumens per watt for an ideal light source). They can be found many times in older aquarium light hoods. They burn out frequently, put off a lot of heat, and normally do not have an appropriate spectrum associated with them. Most incandescent lamps can be replaced with commonly available and efficient screw in power compact bulbs.

====Standard fluorescent====
Standard fluorescent tubes are the common light bars found in commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The downside to regular fluorescent lights is that they do not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.

====Higher-output fluorescent====
There are several improved variations of fluorescent technology. The main ones are very high output (VHO), power compact fluorescent (PC), and T-5 high output (HO).

VHO fluorescent lamps run at higher power levels, usually about three times the standard wattage for a given bulb length. They have the advantage of high light output, but the larger diameter bulbs limit the efficiency of reflectors and the number of bulbs that can be fit in an aquarium hood.

PC lighting is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner and are often folded over one another to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power compact fluorescent bulbs. PC bulbs are recommended to be replaced every six months to a year to keep the desired light spectrum.

T-5 HO lights are the newest variation on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, which allows for more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power compact fluorescent or VHO lighting fixtures. On the downside, T-5 lighting is the most expensive type fluorescent lighting available. Many times it is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent metal halide light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required.

All types of fluorescent lighting offer the same efficiency in lumens per watt; it is the shape of the bulb and reflectors that makes their overall outputs different.

====Metal halide====
Metal halide lights are generally the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 lumens per watt of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This is often referred to as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even the very bottom levels of most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of metal halide lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced.

Most metal halide fixtures are more expensive than fluorescent systems, but are required for some reef setups. Halide lamps concentrate heat as well as light output. The surface of an operating lamp becomes hot enough to cause second or third degree burns instantly, so this lighting technology must be used with caution. The heat produced can also warm the aquarium to unacceptable levels, possibly necessitating the use of a chiller for certain aquarium setups.

====LED====
The most recent addition to the list of aquarium lighting technologies is LED lighting. These have the potential to be much more efficient than any other technology, but are not fully developed. LEDs have the advantage of point source lighting, but are also adjustable to most power levels. This allows for more advanced lighting schedules, the simulation of cloud cover, or even lightning storms. So far, LEDs have found use mainly as lunar lighting in commercial products.

Reef-keeping enthusiasts have begun to build their own LED light fixtures as well. Debate over their effectiveness towards coral is still inconclusive, particularly with respect to their ability to give off UV radiation, critical to obtaining a vibrant array of colors that most people interested in LED lighting are looking for.

LED lighting can be considered one of the most energy efficient and low impact options to lighting a reef tank as well, with a projected life expectancy of seven years. LED lighting also helps replicate the natural look of sunlight because most LED lights produce shimmer lines like the ones found on natural reefs.

The amount of emitters or LED fixtures can vary greatly based on these and other factors; photosynthetic specimens being kept, the input energy lost to heat, the PAR of light at a certain depth of aquarium water, and the light spectrum (PUR) used.
Light spectrums that most closely duplicate nature are going to be most efficient. This includes blue light in spectrums approximately from 410 nm to 485 nm along with white (daylight) spectrums from 6500K to 14000K. Warm white emitters with the more yellow and green spectrums should be avoided.
The results can be anywhere from .8 watt per gallon to 1.5 watt per gallon of an average depth aquarium.

====Overall lighting considerations====
When considering lighting for an aquarium, there are generally two factors to consider: wattage and color temperature. Depending on the type of lighting (i.e. fluorescents, metal halide, etc.) the wattage of light emitted may vary considerably, from tens of watts to several hundred watts in a lighting system. Wattage, while not indicative of color, is equivalent to power and essentially determines how brightly the light will shine. Due to the scattering of light in water, the deeper one&#x27;s tank is, the more powerful the lighting required. Color temperature, measured in kelvins (albeit slightly unrepresentively) refers to the color of light being emitted by the lamp and is based on the concept of blackbody radiation. Light from the sun has a color temperature of approximately 5900 K and lighting systems with color temperatures &gt;5000 K tend to be best for growing plants in both the marine and freshwater setting. 10,000 K light appears bluish-white and emphasizes coloration in fishes and corals. Higher up on the spectrum there are 14,000 K and 20,000 K bulbs that produce a deep blue tint which mimic the lighting conditions underseas, creating an optimal ambience for invertebrates and livestock present.

=== Temperature control ===
Most marine aquarium inhabitants are endemic to tropical reefs and waters in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Red Sea. Marine aquarium temperatures should mimic the natural environment of the inhabitants and are most commonly maintained at . In regions where the ambient temperature is less than the desired temperature of the aquarium this generally necessitates the use of an aquarium heater. In some areas where ambient temperature is greater than the desired temperature, or for coldwater systems, refrigeration devices known as &quot;chillers&quot; are used to cool the aquarium water.

=== Water testing ===
Marine aquarists commonly test the water in the aquarium for a variety of chemical indicators of water quality. These include:

* Specific gravity, a relative measure of water density, is normally maintained between 1.020 and 1.024 in aquariums with fish only, and 1.023 and 1.026 for aquariums containing invertebrates.
* Salinity should therefore be between 28 and 35 ppt, with the higher values being beneficial in advanced reef systems. Because salinity is by definition directly related to specific gravity, both can be tested with an inexpensive hydrometer or refractometer.
* pH should be maintained between 8.1 and 8.3. 
* Ammonia should be near zero.
* Nitrite should be near zero.
* Nitrate should be well below 10 ppm, but close to zero is best.
* Phosphate should be below 0.3 ppm.
* Alkalinity should be 3.2–4.5 meq/L. or 7 and 12 degrees of carbonate hardness (dKH).
*Copper concentration should be measured and not rise over 0.15 ppm
*Calcium should be around ~ 400 ppm
*Magnesium levels should be ~1250 - 1350 ppm

pH can be raised with a commercially available buffering agent or through calcium-rich substrates. A calibrated calcium reactor can assist in maintaining both pH and alkalinity. Using purified water from a reverse osmosis/deionization (RO/DI) unit can prevent KH and pH fluctuation.

The nitrogen cycle refers to the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While fish waste (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into the water from the fishes&#x27; gills. Biological (bacterial) nitrification converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a &quot;refugium.&quot; A refugium is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. Refugiums usually contain a deep sand bed to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the refugium as another means of nitrate export. As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations.

Other suggested tests include those for calcium, carbonate alkalinity, magnesium, and other trace elements. It is often beneficial (and necessary) for the aquarist to research the water chemistry parameters for the specific organism that is desired.

=== Acclimation ===
Acclimation is a process that is performed when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation. This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry. There are several different methods of doing this, including the use of a drip line, or of a measuring cup or other device to slowly mix water from the aquarium tank into a container with the new animal.

The drip line or trickle acclimating method is a safe and gentle way to introduce saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure can be used to acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set on the floor next to the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.

=== Water changes ===
Water changes are a staple of good saltwater maintenance. Larger (approximately ) aquariums are much more stable and water changes may not need to take place if the nitrogen cycle has fully established itself in the tank, although this is a controversial statement among aquarists. Water changes are used to maintain balance of calcium, carbonate alkalinity, and magnesium which are rapidly depleted in a reef aquarium, while also maintaining levels of other trace elements as well as removing toxic solutes which may accumulate from many different sources and cannot be removed by even advanced filtration methods. Supplements are needed (such as calcium) when regular water changes alone are not able to maintain adequate levels, particularly those of calcium, carbonate, and magnesium. Water changes involve removing a fraction of the total volume of the aquarium, replacing that water with new pre-mixed saltwater. Pre-mixed saltwater has been dechlorinated and/or dechloraminated—typically with an additive such as bisulfite or through filtering. Water should be brought to the same temperature if more than a 5% change is occurring. Salinity should match that of the aquarium, or be dosed very slowly if altering the salinity. Aging and aerating saltwater (such as in a bucket with a powerhead or airstone) is recommended as good practice to allow the pH to stabilize.

Replacement water should be of the same source as the aquarium, whether it be reverse osmosis (RO), de-ionized (DI), distilled or from a municipal supply, in order to avoid drastic changes in water chemistry. In cases where one is replacing a tap water-based salt mix with a reverse osmosis-based salt mix, the replacement water should be added slowly over the course of several hours to avoid sending the aquarium inhabitants into osmotic shock. However, large water changes are not advised under routine circumstances anyway, so this is really irrelevant. Municipal, or tap water, is not recommended for a marine aquarium as it often contains high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates and other dissolved solids which fuel the growth of nuisance algaes, particularly diatoms, which appear as a rust-colored powdery algae and grows in the overabundance of silicates present in all tap water. Water filtered by a four-stage process including mechanical, carbon, reverse-osmosis, and de-ionizing components is recommended as this can provide the easiest route to absolutely pure water. Four- and five-stage RO/DI filtration units can be obtained for as little as $100 and are a cost-effective means of converting tap water into water usable in a marine aquarium.

== Conservation ==
Almost all species kept in marine aquaria at this time are caught in the wild, although tank-raised specimens are becoming increasingly common as a viable alternative. The list of marine aquarium fish, such as clownfish that are captive-bred and available on a commercial scale, is increasing. As of a 2019 report, there were nearly 400 known captive-bred species, 46 that were considered commonly available. Much collecting is done in Indonesia and the Philippines, where use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods, while discouraged, is unfortunately common. The majority of live rock is also harvested in the wild, and recent restrictions on this harvest in Florida have caused a shift to Fijian and aquacultured rock. Natural rock, because it is created by coral polyps, takes many years if not centuries to form, and is a vital habitat for countless marine species; thus, commercial-scale harvesting of naturally occurring live rock has been criticized by conservationists. Additionally, many animal species sold to hobbyists have very specific dietary and habitat requirements that cannot be met by hobbyists (e.g. genus &quot;Labroides&quot; wrasses, the moorish idol); these animals almost inevitably die quickly and have markedly reduced lifespans compared to wild specimens. Often these specific environmental requirements cause improperly housed livestock&#x27;s color and appearance to be poor. These issues are often downplayed by individuals and organizations with a financial interest in the trade. Hobbyists who support conservation should buy only certified net-caught fish (although ensuring the legitimacy of such claims can be difficult) or captive-raised fish, as well as farmed corals and to support legitimate reef conservation efforts. The majority of corals can be &quot;fragged&quot;, whereby a portion of a larger captive coral is separated and can subsequently be raised into an individual specimen, allowing for coral propagation within the domestic aquarium; the trade in frags (i.e. fragments) offers a fantastic opportunity for marine aquarists to obtain new and unique corals while limiting the impact on the natural environment. Rare species and those without a history of being successfully kept in captivity should be avoided.

=== Commercial development ===
Various businesses have commercialized fishkeeping. With the advent of large scale business operations focusing on breeding massive quantities of specimens, marine fishkeeping has become much more widespread than ever before. Perhaps the biggest disincentive to marine fishkeeping, in comparison to freshwater, is the initial setup cost. A reef tank full of coral and equipment can cost in excess of $2,500 US, although a budget-minded home hobbyist could spend less than half of this and still get a satisfactory result.

<text>The Pushkin Prize () was a Russian literary award presented to a Russian writer considered to have achieved the highest standard of literary excellence. It was established in 1881 by the Russian Academy of Sciences to honor one of the greatest Russian poets Alexander Pushkin (1799–1837), then discontinued during the Soviet period. It was restored in 1989 by Alfred Toepfer Foundation in Hamburg. In 1995, the State Pushkin Prize was established by Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s decree, with Vladimir Sokolov being the first laureate. Both lasted till 2005. In 2005 the New Pushkin Prize was established by the Aleksander Zhukov Fund, as well as the Pushkin and Mikhaylovskoye museums. In 2017 the International Creative Contest &quot;World Pushkin&quot; was established by the Russkiy Mir Foundation and the A. Pushkin State Literary Memorial and Natural Museum-Reserve Boldino.

<doc id="1163667" wikidata="Q1966082" url="?curid=1163667" title="I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am">
<text>&quot;I&#x27;m Henery the Eighth, I Am&quot; (also &quot;I&#x27;m Henery the VIII, I Am&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m Henry VIII, I Am&quot;; spelled &quot;Henery&quot; but pronounced &quot;&#x27;Enery&quot; in the Cockney style normally used to sing it) is a 1910 British music hall song by Fred Murray and R. P. Weston. It was a signature song of the music hall star Harry Champion.

Joe Brown included the song on his first album &quot;A Picture of You&quot; in 1962. In 1965, it became the fastest-selling song in history to that point when it was revived by Herman&#x27;s Hermits, becoming the group&#x27;s second number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, dethroning &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; by the Rolling Stones. Despite that success, the single was not released in the UK. The Herman&#x27;s Hermits version is a very short song, one of the shortest ever to be a number-one single in the US.

In the well-known chorus, Henery explains that his wife had been married seven times before, each time to another Henery:
&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;m &#x27;Enery the Eighth, I am,
&#x27;Enery the Eighth I am, I am!
I got married to the widow next door,
She&#x27;s been married seven times before
And every one was an &#x27;Enery
She wouldn&#x27;t have a Willie nor a Sam
I&#x27;m her eighth old man named &#x27;Enery
&#x27;Enery the Eighth, I am!&lt;/poem&gt;

However, in the Hermits&#x27; version, Peter Noone ends each chorus with &quot;I&#x27;m her eighth old man, I&#x27;m &#x27;Enery&quot; and never sings &quot;named&quot;.

== Harry Champion version ==
According to one source, Champion &quot;used to fire off [the chorus] at tremendous speed with almost desperate gusto, his face bathed in sweat and his arms and legs flying in all directions.&quot; In later versions recorded by Champion, &quot;Willie&quot; is changed to &quot;William&quot; because the former is a British slang term for &quot;penis.&quot;

== Joe Brown version ==
In 1961, this song was recorded and extensively performed live by the British star Joe Brown, who revived the song and made it largely known in the British pop world. His version has two choruses either side of his guitar solo (B-side, Piccadilly Records 7N 35005). George Harrison was a fan of Brown&#x27;s and sang the song as part of the Beatles&#x27; early repertoire. The group never recorded their version. To the present day, Brown often performs it in concert.

== Herman&#x27;s Hermits version ==
The rock and roll stylings of the song gave Herman&#x27;s Hermits their second US number one hit in 1965; like the Brown arrangement, it contains only the chorus (and none of the three verses) of the original. As a result, the tune is a mere one minute and fifty seconds long, one of the shortest-ever songs to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart. In their short and fast take of the song, the guitar and bass are considered proto-punk and were a direct influence on the Ramones, (indeed the song &quot;Judy Is A Punk&quot; includes the line &quot;Second verse, same as the first&quot; as in the Hermits&#x27; tune.) The speedy guitar work at the break by lead guitarist Derek Leckenby evokes Chuck Berry sonically (e. g. “Johnny B. Goode”) then memorably shifts into quoting the melody. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the song&#x27;s &quot;strong dance beat and vocal performance.&quot;

They performed the song on &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; as well as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. This version was also performed on the third-season premiere of &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; with Jimmy Dean and Jim Henson&#x27;s Rowlf the Dog wearing wigs, three months after Herman&#x27;s performance on Sullivan.

==Chart history==

===Weekly charts===

===Year-end charts===

== Other versions ==
Connie Francis recorded a version for her 1966 album &quot;Connie Francis and The Kids Next Door&quot;.

== Title and lyrics ==
The song is traditionally sung in a Cockney accent. Earlier sources usually spell the name &quot;Henery&quot; (as do some old sources when referring to the historical King of England and Ireland), and the music requires the name &quot;Henery&quot; (or &quot;&#x27;Enery&quot;) to be pronounced as three syllables. The sheet music for the 1965 Herman&#x27;s Hermits revival, however, presented the name as &quot;Henry&quot;, as do sources referring to this version.

In the Herman&#x27;s Hermits version, the band sings the lyrics three times. Between the first two choruses, Peter Noone calls out, &quot;Second verse, same as the first!&quot; The background singers on the version recorded by Connie Francis use this call as well.

== In popular culture ==
* In the Flanders and Swann song &quot;Greensleeves&quot; (in which the duo purport to tell the tale of the classic song&#x27;s creation), the monarch himself claims to be the true author of the piece, stating &quot;We are Henry VIII, we are!&quot;
* In the 1990 film &quot;Ghost&quot;, Sam (Patrick Swayze) sings this song on a continuous run in a bad Cockney London accent all night long, to Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) to annoy her into helping him.
* Homer Simpson - in the persona of Henry VIII - sings a parody of this song in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2004 episode &quot;Margical History Tour&quot;, with the lyrics referencing Henry&#x27;s voracious appetite.
* Alvin and the Chipmunks covered this song.
* The original Harry Champion version of the song was used as the titles music of The Libertines 2012 music documentary &quot;There Are No Innocent Bystanders&quot;.

<text>Sesbania is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae, and the only genus found in tribe Sesbanieae. Riverhemp is a common name for plants in this genus. Notable species include the rattlebox (&quot;Sesbania punicea&quot;), spiny sesbania (&quot;Sesbania bispinosa&quot;), and &quot;Sesbania sesban&quot;, which is used in cooking. Plants of this genus, some of which are aquatic, can be used in alley cropping to increase the soil&#x27;s nitrogen content. The species of rhizobia responsible for nitrogen fixation in &quot;Sesbania rostrata&quot; is &quot;Azorhizobium caulinodans&quot;.

Some 60 species are currently accepted, with about 39 still unresolved. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, in the Americas from the southern United States to northern Argentina, in sub-Saharan Africa, in southern Asia, and in New Guinea, Australia, and the Pacific. The largest number of species are found in Africa, and the remainder in Australia, Hawaii, and Asia.

==Fossil record==
Fossil seed pods from the upper Oligocene resembling &quot;Sesbania&quot; have been found in the Hungarian locality of Eger Wind-brickyard. The fossil species grew in a swampy and riparian environment.

<text>Nicholas Paul Rimando (born June 17, 1979) is an American former professional soccer player who last played as a goalkeeper for Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer and the United States national team. He holds the Major League Soccer records for career wins, clean sheets, saves, and overall appearances.

==Youth and college==
Rimando was born in Montclair, California and attended Montclair High School. He played two years of college soccer at UCLA. As a freshman in 1997, he tended goal as the Bruins won the College Cup; after his sophomore year, he signed a Project-40 contract with MLS.

==Professional career ==

===Miami and D.C.===
Rimando was selected 35th in the third round of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft by the Miami Fusion, and quickly took the starting position from Jeff Cassar, starting 22 games as a rookie. He started 25 games the following season, helping the Fusion to win the 2001 MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield.

When the Fusion were contracted after the 2001 season, Rimando was selected third overall by D.C. United (his coach at Miami, Ray Hudson, was the new United boss) in the subsequent Allocation Draft.
For DC, Rimando played in every game in 2002 and in 25 games in 2003 until he missed the end of the season with an injury. In 2004, with Hudson gone, he lost his starting job to Troy Perkins, but regained it for the stretch run, backstopping DC to the MLS Cup. In 2005, he regained his everyday starter status, but was beaten out by Perkins again in 2006, playing only two games during the whole season.

===Real Salt Lake===
On December 11, 2006, Rimando was traded along with Freddy Adu to Real Salt Lake. He was then traded to New York Red Bulls on February 9, only to be traded back to Real Salt Lake on February 23 following the sudden retirement of the latter team&#x27;s first-choice keeper Scott Garlick.

Rimando was RSL&#x27;s first-choice keeper during the 2007 season. His team struggled constantly and never seriously contended for a playoff berth, but Rimando led MLS with 146 saves in 27 games, including efforts against New England (13 saves in a 0–0 draw on June 2) and Toronto FC (12 saves in a 0–0 draw on September 15). His hard work was rewarded at the end of the season when he was named Real Salt Lake&#x27;s 2007 Most Valuable Player.

Rimando continued as Salt Lake&#x27;s first-choice keeper in 2008 and 2009. He emerged as one of the top keepers in the league, as evidenced by his MLS Player of the Month award in July 2008. His strong performance between the pipes, combined with his team&#x27;s much-improved defensive play, carried the team to Western Conference Final in 2008 and even further in 2009. In the Eastern Conference Final against the Chicago Fire, RSL battled to a scoreless draw after 120 minutes. Rimando made several saves in regulation and overtime, then added three saves on penalty kicks, lifting his team to a 5–4 shootout victory. In the MLS Cup championship match, Rimando again found himself facing a shootout, and again he delivered. He made three saves, leading RSL to a victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy. For his efforts, he was named MLS Cup MVP, only the second goalkeeper to earn the honor (Tony Meola accomplished the feat in 2000).

In 2010, RSL emerged as possibly the greatest defensive team in the history of Major League Soccer. With Rimando as goalkeeper, Salt Lake set an MLS record for fewest goals allowed in a single season - just 20 in 30 matches. Rimando also set club records for most shutouts in a single season (14) and longest shutout streak (568 minutes). Additionally, the team set a league record for highest goal differential (+25), but they were upset by FC Dallas in the first round of the playoffs and couldn&#x27;t defend their MLS Cup title from the previous season. Despite his stellar season - one of the greatest ever by a keeper in American professional soccer - Rimando did not receive the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award. Instead, it was given to Donovan Ricketts of the L.A. Galaxy, which caused some controversy around the league.

On February 4, 2011, Rimando signed a contract extension with RSL that kept him with the club through the 2013 season.

On March 3, 2013, Rimando became the 2nd MLS goalkeeper to earn 100 shutouts after a 2–0 win over the San Jose Earthquakes.

In December 2013, Real Salt Lake and Rimando traveled to Sporting Park in Kansas City, Kansas to face Sporting Kansas City for the MLS Championship Game. Rimando played well despite 10 degree temperatures. He made four major saves in the game. His third save was perhaps the best. Graham Zusi shot a high half volley, but Rimando tipped it over the crossbar. The game went on to penalty kicks after a 1–1 draw. Rimando saved a penalty kick from Matt Besler, but Real Salt Lake lost in sudden death.

On August 9, 2014, playing at home against his former club, D.C. United, Rimando secured the lead in career shutouts for an MLS goalkeeper in a 3–0 win.

On March 1, 2019, Rimando announced he would be retiring following the 2019 season. He played his final match on October 23, 2019, in a MLS Cup Playoffs match against Seattle Sounders FC at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, Washington. Rimando played with an injured left shoulder and made seven saves as Real Salt Lake lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the playoffs. He finished his MLS career with the league record in appearances (515), wins (223), saves (1,712), and shutouts (154).

==International career==
Although mostly a backup to Tim Howard, Rimando played for the United States at the 1999 World Youth Championship in Nigeria. He earned his first senior team cap on November 17, 2002, against El Salvador. After that, he did not receive much attention from the national team until his outstanding play in MLS in 2009 caught the attention of U.S. coach Bob Bradley. Rimando was invited to train with the senior team in 2010 in preparation for the World Cup, although he was not selected for the tournament. He has made some international appearances since then, including a standout performance in a friendly against Panama on January 25, 2012. He was consistently the third-choice keeper under former manager Jurgen Klinsmann, and was the first-choice keeper at the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

On May 22, 2014, Rimando was named to the final 23-man roster for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The tournament was his first-ever World Cup finals roster, though he did not log any minutes in any of the USMNT&#x27;s matches.

==Personal life==
Rimando&#x27;s father is of Filipino descent and his mother is of Mexican descent. In December 2005, Rimando married his longtime girlfriend, Jacqui Little. She played for the Washington Freedom in the now-defunct WUSA and is also from California. The wedding was performed by teammate Ben Olsen in Malibu, California. Rimando and Little have two children, Jett Nicholas Rimando and Benny Rose Rimando. They have since divorced.

<text>Semic Comics ( is one of the leading comic book publishers in France. It is officially known as Semic S.A.

Along with French comics, the company formerly published the official translations of products produced by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Today, Semic publishes translations from other American publishers such as Avatar Press, Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, and Top Cow Productions.

Semic&#x27;s imprints include Semic Books and Semic Manga.

== History ==
=== Éditions Lug ===

In 1950, writer/editor Marcel Navarro and Auguste Vistel founded Éditions Lug. At first, the company only reprinted old French and Italian comics. But soon, Navarro decided that his company needed some original characters. He enlisted a number of French and Italian studios to create a new series. Although many of them invoked characters featured in American comics, they had enough differences to make them unique.

In 1969, Éditions Lug began publishing licensed translations of Marvel Comics in a magazine called &quot;Fantask&quot;. That year also saw the creation of &quot;Wampus&quot;. But French censorship forced Éditions Lug to cancel both of these magazines after six issues.

In the next two decades, Éditions Lug continued to expand, thanks to its growing program of French editions of Marvel Comics, which began to include &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Many new magazines and series were added to their French line. A shared universe began to emerge, although not nearly as tightly integrated as the Marvel Universe.

In the mid-1980s, Auguste Vistel died. Eventually, Marcel Navarro chose to retire. In 1989, Éditions Lug was sold to the Semic Group / Semic Press, a Scandinavian comic book publisher, and renamed Semic France.

=== Semic Group ===
After Navarro&#x27;s departure, Semic continued to publish French editions of Marvel Comics, but in 1993 discontinued the creation of original material. The half-dozen original Lug titles that remained became reprints-only; Lug was fully merged into Semic in 1994.

=== Tournon Group / Semic S.A. ===
In 1997 the Semic Group was sold to the Danish media house Egmont. At the time of the sale, the Semic Group sold a controlling interest in the company that had formerly been Éditions Lug back to its French partners/distributors, the Tournon Group. The new, autonomous publisher operated under the name Semic S.A. In May 1999, Tournon moved the company&#x27;s headquarters from Lyon to Paris.

In 2000, under new editor-in-chief Thierry Mornet, Semic S.A. revamped its old characters and began publishing new stories. In late 2003/early 2004, Semic canceled the new lines. As a result, in early 2004, a multinational group of writers and artists formed Hexagon Comics and reclaimed the rights to the characters they had created for the publisher.

In 2005, the Tournon Group dissolved the company, although the &quot;Semic&quot; brand continued to belong to Tournon.

Since 2011, the name has been revived by one of Tournon&#x27;s companies, Semic Distribution, which is responsible for marketing derivative products, in particular those of Marvel Comics.

<doc id="1163729" wikidata="Q1204356" url="?curid=1163729" title="ROM hacking">
<text>ROM hacking (short for Read-only memory hacking) is the process of modifying a ROM image or ROM file to alter the contents contained within, usually of a video game to alter the game&#x27;s graphics, dialogue, levels, gameplay, and/or other elements. This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to improve an old game of importance, as a creative outlet, or to essentially make &quot;new&quot;, unofficial games using the old game&#x27;s engine.

ROM hacking is generally accomplished through use of a hex editor (a program for editing non-textual data) and various specialized tools such as tile editors, and game-specific tools which are generally used for editing levels, items, and the like, although more advanced tools such as assemblers and debuggers are occasionally used. Once ready, they are usually distributed on the Internet for others to play on an emulator or a games console.

Many ROM hacks today are typically created as a fun way of playing the original games, as they typically redesign the game with new mechanics, graphics, levels, and other features while keeping most if not all of the items the same, effectively creating either an improved or an entirely different version of the original games. Some hacks are also created to unlock and/or reimplement features that existed in the game&#x27;s code but are not utilized in-game, especially for when rediscovering or restoring old beta content that was hidden away from the final game&#x27;s release.

Fan translation (known as &quot;translation hacking&quot; within the ROM hacking community) is another type of ROM hacking; there are also anti-censorship hacks that exist to restore a game to its original state, which is often seen with older games that were imported, as publishers&#x27; content policies for video games (most notably, Nintendo&#x27;s) were much stricter in the United States than Japan or Europe; randomizers are also available for certain games, which are designed to shuffle entity placements from within the games. Although much of the method applies to both types of hacking, this article focuses on &quot;creative hacking&quot; such as editing game levels.

==Communities==
Most hacking groups offer web space for hosting hacks and screenshots (sometimes only hosting hacks by the group&#x27;s members and hosting almost any hack), a message board, and often have an IRC channel. Several hacking groups have also created guides that aims to help beginners get into grips with ROM hacking for the first time, such as the legendary &quot;Rom Hacking Bible&quot; for the NES written in the mid-to-late 1990s, while others are designed for those that wanted to learn how to add or change things from start to finish.

There are many sites on the internet dedicated to world of ROM hacking, with each site focusing on several hacks and translations of several different games across multiple series, franchises and platforms. One of the most popular sites dedicated to ROM hacking of video games was ROMhacking.net, which first went online in late 2005. From its inception up until 2024, it served as a hub related to all things ROM hacking, hosting a repository of hacks, translations, utilities, documents, and patches for many well-known and obscure video games from the third generation up to the seventh generation. ROMhacking.com was the immediate predecessor of ROMhacking.net, which launched five years earlier in 2000 and was briefly renamed as ROMhacking.org between 2001 and 2002 before returning to its original name afterwards and then went offline in late 2004.

ROMhacking.net has since transitioned over into being a read-only news site for ROM hacking projects after nearly 20 years of hosting on August 1, 2024 due to various reasons beyond the site&#x27;s control, with its former database and files being archived on the Internet Archive. New submissions on the site were also permanently closed on the same day of the announcement, and all downloads will remain available on the site for as long as the site maintainers can handle.

==Methods==
Having been created by many different programmers or programming teams, ROM data can be very diverse.

===Hex editing===
A hex editor is one of the most fundamental tools in any ROM hacker&#x27;s repertoire. Hex editors are usually used for editing text, and for editing other data for which the structure is known (for example, item properties), and Assembly hacking.

Editing text is one of the most basic forms of hacking. Many games do not store their text in ASCII form, and because of this, some specialized hex editors have been developed, which can be told what byte values correspond to what letter(s) of the alphabet, to facilitate text editing; a file that defines these byte=letter relationships is called a &quot;table&quot; file. Other games use simple text compression techniques (such as byte pair encoding, also called dual tile encoding or DTE, in which certain combinations of two or more letters are encoded as one byte) which a suitably equipped hex editor can facilitate editing.

A hex editor is the tool of choice for editing things such as character/item properties if the structure and location of this data are known and there is no game-specific editor for the game that can edit this information. Some intrepid hackers also perform level editing with a hex editor, but this is extremely difficult (except on games whose level storage format closely resembles how it is presented in a hex editor).

===Graphics editing===
Another basic hacking skill is graphics hacking, which is changing the appearance of the game&#x27;s environments, characters, fonts, or other such things. The format of graphics data varies from console to console, but most of the early ones (NES, Super NES, Game Boy, etc.) store graphics in tiles, which are 8x8-pixel units of data, which are arranged on-screen to produce the desired result. Editing these tiles is also possible with a hex editor, but is generally accomplished with a tile editor (such as &quot;Tile Layer&quot; or &quot;Tile Molester&quot;), which can graphically display the ROM data, as well as finding and editing tiles.

Graphics hacks can range from simple edits (such as giving Mario an afro or Luigi a golf club) to &quot;porting&quot; characters from one game to another (such as creating pixelated (&quot;retro-styled&quot;) sprites of later generation Pokémon for use with Generation I-V Pokémon games), to full-blown thematic changes (usually with accompanying palette changes; see below).

More sophisticated graphics hacking involves changing more than just tiles and colors, but also on how the tiles are arranged, or tile groups generated, giving more flexibility and control over the final appearance. This is accomplished through hex editing or a specialized tool (either for a specific game or a specific system). An example of this approach was the incomplete &quot;Pokémon Torzach&quot;, a Pokémon FireRed hack of that attempts to add a whole new generation of Pokémon and tiles to the game. It was able to achieve some desirable results with the tools that were currently available at the time. &quot;Super Mario Land 2 DX: 6 Golden Coins&quot; is another example of graphics hacking, which is an enhanced version of the original game that added, among others, full-color support (the original game was greyscale-only) and some quality-of-life improvements, such as fixes with screen flickering issues from the original game.
===Palette editing===

Another common form of hacking is &quot;palette hacking&quot;, where color values are modified to change the colors a player sees in the game (this often goes hand-in-hand with graphics hacking); Palette values are commonly stored in Hex. This is fairly easy for NES games, the graphics of which use a pre-defined set of colors among which a game selects (using a YIQ-based color palette); palette hacking in this case entails changing which of those colors are selected. The matter is slightly more complicated with Super NES games as well as games for other systems (which includes Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) games), which store absolute RGB color values. Palette editors are usually simple and often are with level editors or game-specific graphics editors.

===Level editing===

One of the most popular forms of ROM hacking, level editing entails modifying or redesigning a game&#x27;s levels or maps. This is almost exclusively done with an editor specially tailored for a particular game (called a &quot;level editor&quot;). Level edits can be done to make the game more challenging, to alter the flow of the game&#x27;s plot, or just to give something new to an old game. Combined with extensive graphics hacking, the game can take on a very different look and feel.

===Data editing===

A core component of many hacks (especially of role-playing video games) is editing data such as character, item, and enemy properties. This is usually done either &quot;by hand&quot; (with a hex editor) if the location and structure of the data is known, or with a game-specific editor that has this functionality. Through this, a hacker can alter how weapons work, how strong enemies are or how they act, etc. This can be done to make the game easier or harder or to create new scenarios for the player to face.

===Assembly hacking===

The most powerful, and arguably the most difficult, hacking technique is editing the game&#x27;s actual code, a process called &quot;ASM hacking&quot; (&quot;ASM&quot; means &quot;assembly&quot;, referring to the low-level programming language that gets executed by the CPU). There is no set pattern for ASM hacking, as the code varies widely from game to game, but most skilled ASM hackers either use an emulator equipped with a built-in debugger or tracer, or run the ROM through a disassembler, then analyze the code and modify it using a hex editor or assembler according to their needs. While quite challenging compared to the relatively simple methods listed above, &quot;anything&quot; is possible with ASM hacking, usually within the limitations of the hardware and software of the gaming platform. This can range from altering enemy AI to changing how graphics are generated. If the developers used a typed language, the hacker may be able to compile their code for the game in the same language if they have access to a proper compiler. One such example would be using C to hack Nintendo 64 games, since MIPS-GCC can compile code for the Nintendo 64.

===Music hacking===
Music hacks are relatively rare in most hacks, due to the wide variety of ways games store music data (hence the difficulty in locating and modifying this data) as well as the difficulties in composing new music (or porting music from another game). As music cracking is very uncommon, many hacks do not have any ported/composed music added in. Exceptions exist, however, such as the most recent &quot;Super Mario World&quot; hacks where custom music can have new instruments not found in the original game. Other games that have music hacking as part of their research and hacking communities are the NES &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, and the Mega Drive (Genesis) &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games.

As many Game Boy Advance games use the M4A Engine (informally called &quot;Sappy Driver&quot; and officially known as &quot;MusicPlayer2000&quot; or MP2k) for music, the program SapTapper can be used to hack Game Boy Advance music data. Various other utilities were created to work with the engine such as Sappy 2006. Another instance of the same engine being used between games is on the Nintendo 64 where most games use the same format; albeit with different sound banks for each game. A utility known as the N64 Midi Tool was created to edit the sequences that the majority of Nintendo 64 games use, however it does not cover first-party N64 titles that use a slightly different engine such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

On the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), several games made for the system had its music and sound effects created under a single sound engine commonly known as &quot;SMPS&quot; (also known as &quot;Sound-Source&quot; by some developers), which has been offered in both 68000 and Z80-based versions. Leveraging the YM2612 and SN76489 sound chips of the console, this engine was predominantly used in a wide variety of Japanese-developed games for the system (including Sega&#x27;s first-party games), with some games providing modified versions of the sound engine tailored for a specific game. The SMPS engine has been researched for decades by many hackers, which led to the creation of various utilities that can alter and create music (and sound effects) for games using the SMPS engine (most notably the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games in particular); many of the compositions and arrangements made under the SMPS engine had eventually made their way onto the Steam Workshop.

===ROM expansion===

Generally speaking, a ROM hacker cannot normally add content to a game, but merely change existing content. This limit can be overcome through &quot;ROM expansion&quot;, whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased, making room for more content and, in turn, a larger game. The difficulty in doing this varies depending on the system for which the game was made. For example, expanding an NES ROM may be difficult or even impossible due to the mapper used by the game. For example, if a mapper allows 16 ROM banks and all of them are used, expanding the ROM further is impossible without somehow converting the game to another mapper, which could be easy or extremely difficult. On the other hand, expanding an SNES game (and even a Mega Drive (Genesis) game for that matter) is (relatively) straightforward. To utilize the added space, parts of the game code have to be modified or rewritten (see Assembly hacking above) so the game knows where to look. Another type of &quot;ROM expansion&quot; that is fairly easy is Game Boy Advance ROMs. The ROMs themselves are generally small, but the memory space available sometimes exceeds it by multiples of up to 17.

==Distribution==

Once a hack is completed (or an incomplete version is deemed suitable for an interim release) it is released onto the Internet for others to play. The generally accepted way to do this is by making an unofficial patch (in IPS format or others) that can be applied to the unmodified ROM. This, and usually some form of documentation, is put in an archive file and uploaded somewhere. IPS is a format for recording the differences between two binary files (in this case, between the unmodified and hacked ROMs) and is suitable for ROM hacks. IPS is still used today for small patches—however, as ROMs became larger, this format became useless, leading to quite a few file formats being created—such as NINJA and PPF (also known as &quot;PlayStation Patch Format&quot;). PPF is still used today, particularly to patch large files such as ISO CD-ROM images as well as Nintendo 64 games. A new patch format, UPS, has also been developed by the ROM hacking community, designed to be the successor to IPS and PPF.
A more recent patching format, the APS patching system, has also been developed by a devoted Game Boy Advance ROM hacker. Compared to other patching formats, the APS system is more space efficient, is reversible, and is faster than its predecessor.

The main purpose of distributing a hack in patch form is to avoid the legal aspects of distributing entire ROM images; the patch records only what has &quot;changed&quot; in the ROM, hence distributing it does not usually distribute parts of the original game. A patch is also normally drastically smaller than a full ROM image (an NES ROM can run anywhere from 8 KB to 2 MB; a Super NES ROM can run from 256 KB to 6 MB; and Mega Drive (Genesis) ROMs can run from 512 KB to 4 MB).

In a novel example of legal distribution, Sega released a Steam-based virtual hub for its previous collection of Mega Drive (Genesis) games, entitled &quot;Sega Mega Drive Classics Hub&quot;. The &quot;Hub&quot;, besides allowing players to play emulated versions of these older games, takes advantage of Steam&#x27;s support for user-created content through the Steam Workshop, officially allowing the distribution of ROM hacks of any of the offered games.

==Usage==
Patched ROMs are often played on emulators, however, it is possible to play patched ROMs on the original hardware. The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled (which usually involves replacing the original ROM chip with a new one), or another compatible cartridge of the same type, such as flash cartridges. This is particularly popular for fan translations, homebrew games, prototypes, games for which ROM cartridges were never produced, or for games that require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware that are not available in emulators.

==Systems and games==
The majority of ROM hacking is done on NES and SNES games (including Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) games to an extent), since such games are small and simple compared to games of more advanced consoles such as the Nintendo 64 or Nintendo DS. Games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance are also popular for hacking, as well as games for the PlayStation to a lesser extent. However, games intended for more recent consoles are not exempt from hacking, and as computers have become faster over time and more programs and utilities have been written, more PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS hacks have emerged.
Of these, popular games to play are popular games to hack; many hacks have been released of games of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, &quot;Mario&quot; series (including &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario World&quot;), &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series (including &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;, and &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;), &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, &quot;EarthBound&quot;, &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, and many others.

A notable hacked arcade game was &quot;Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition&quot;, which featured increased game speed and new special moves. The success of this game prompted Capcom to release &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot; as an official response.

&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; magazine published a monthly column called &quot;Program Pitstop&quot;. This focused mainly on cheat hacks for games, but also featured both a level map printer for the original &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, as well as a full level editor for the same game.

He served as its president and chairman until 2019, where he stepped down. As of October 2011, Fukunaga was named chairman of online video game publisher GameSamba.

== Biography ==
Fukunaga was born in Itami, Hyōgo, Japan, and grew up in West Lafayette, Indiana in the United States. He graduated from West Lafayette High School in 1979.

Fukunaga attended Purdue University where he got his BSEE in 1982 and his MSEE in 1984. He later moved to Boca Raton, Florida to work as an engineer for IBM. He then attended Columbia Business School, obtaining an MBA in 1989. He held a position with Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) before getting a job with Tandem Computers in Sunnyvale, California.

Fukunaga is also the co-founder and manager of EchoLight Studios, a Texas-based Christian television production company run by Rick Santorum. EchoLight initially shared office space with Fukunaga&#x27;s Funimation.

Originally, Toei Animation told Funimation that they could not have the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. However, Fukunaga&#x27;s uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was one of the producers for Toei Company and helped him convince Toei Animation to give the license to Funimation. So Fukunaga went to coworker Daniel Cocanougher, whose family owned a feed mill in Decatur, Texas, and convinced the Cocanougher family to sell their business and invest in creating a production company. With that, Funimation was established in 1994.

In 2005, Funimation was acquired by the Navarre Corporation for US$100.4 million, Fukunaga still remained the company&#x27;s CEO. In 2011, the company was sold to a group of investors which included Fukunaga himself. In 2017, 95% of Funimation was sold to Sony Pictures Television Networks for US$143 million, with Fukunaga retaining a 5% stake.

In 2019, Fukunaga stepped down as general manager of Funimation. His remaining equity interest was repurchased by Sony Pictures when he left the firm. In 2022, Funimation changed its name to Crunchyroll LLC, after a streaming service of the same name it had a acquired one year earlier.

During an October 2023 seminar at Columbia Business School’s Center on Japanese Economy and Business, Fukunaga was asked by an audience member why he chose to retire from Funimation. Fukunaga replied, &quot;Honestly, after cashing out twice in the company, I really didn’t need to work for a living anymore!&quot;

== Personal life ==
Fukunaga is married to Cindy Brennan, who also was a co-founder and former executive producer at Funimation. They have three children. He has one sister, Nina Fukunaga Johnson, who is a radiation oncologist in Michigan.

<doc id="1163734" wikidata="Q3618497" url="?curid=1163734" title="Anthony Hecht">
<text>Anthony Evan Hecht (January 16, 1923 – October 20, 2004) was an American poet. His work combined a deep interest in form with a passionate desire to confront the horrors of 20th century history, with the Second World War, in which he fought, and the Holocaust being recurrent themes in his work.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Hecht was born in New York City to German-Jewish parents. He was educated at various schools in the city – he was a classmate of Jack Kerouac at Horace Mann School – but showed no great academic ability, something he would later refer to as &quot;conspicuous&quot;. However, as a freshman English student at Bard College in New York he discovered the works of Wallace Stevens, W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, and Dylan Thomas. It was at this point that he decided he would become a poet. Hecht&#x27;s parents were not happy at his plans and tried to discourage them, even getting family friend Ted Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, to attempt to dissuade him.

In 1944, upon completing his final year at Bard, Hecht was drafted into the 97th Infantry Division and was sent to the battlefields in Europe. He saw combat in Germany in the &quot;Ruhr Pocket&quot; and in Cheb in Czechoslovakia. However, his most significant experience occurred on April 23, 1945, when Hecht&#x27;s division helped liberate Flossenbürg concentration camp. Hecht was ordered to interview French prisoners in the hope of gathering evidence on the camp&#x27;s commanders. Years later, Hecht said of this experience, &quot;The place, the suffering, the prisoners&#x27; accounts were beyond comprehension. For years after I would wake shrieking.&quot;

===Career===
After the war ended, Hecht was sent to occupied Japan, where he became a staff writer with &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. He returned to the US in March 1946 and immediately took advantage of the G.I. Bill to study under the poet–critic John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College, Ohio. Here he came into contact with fellow poets such as Randall Jarrell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Allen Tate. He later received his master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University. In 1947 Hecht attended the University of Iowa and taught in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, together with writer Robie Macauley, with whom Hecht had served during World War II, but, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his war service, gave it up swiftly to enter psychoanalysis.
In spring, 1947, he taught at Kenyon. His first poems, &quot;Once Removed&quot; and &quot;To a Soldier Killed in Germany&quot;, were published in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;. Later that year, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned to his parents&#x27; home in New York City and entered psychoanalysis. In 1948, his poems begin to appear in &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Furioso&quot;. He later won the Furioso Poetry Award and enrolled at Columbia University as a candidate for a master&#x27;s degree in English literature.

Hecht released his first collection, &quot;A Summoning of Stones&quot;, in 1954. Even at this stage Hecht&#x27;s poetry was often compared with that of W. H. Auden, with whom Hecht had become friends in 1951 during a holiday on the Italian island of Ischia, where Auden spent each summer. In 1993 Hecht published &quot;The Hidden Law&quot;, a critical reading of Auden&#x27;s body of work. In his second book, &quot;The Hard Hours&quot;, Hecht first addressed his own experiences of World War II – memories that had caused him to have a nervous breakdown in 1959. Hecht spent three months in hospital following his breakdown, although he was spared electric shock therapy, unlike Sylvia Plath, whom he had encountered while teaching at Smith College.

Hecht&#x27;s main source of income was as a teacher of poetry, most notably at the University of Rochester, where he taught from 1967 to 1985. He also spent varying lengths of time teaching at other notable institutions such as Smith, Bard, Harvard, Georgetown, and Yale. Between 1982 and 1984, he held the esteemed position of Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Hecht won a number of literary awards including: the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (for &quot;The Hard Hours&quot;), the 1983 Bollingen Prize, the 1988 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the 1989 Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry, the 1997 Wallace Stevens Award, the 1999/2000 Frost Medal, and the Tanning Prize.

Hecht died on October 20, 2004, at his home in Washington, D.C.; he is buried at the cemetery at Bard College. One month later, on November 17, Hecht was awarded the National Medal of Arts, accepted on his behalf by his wife, Helen Hecht.

The Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize is awarded annually by the Waywiser Press.

==Literary style, inspirations, and themes==
Hecht was known for his masterful use of traditional forms and linguistic control. Extraordinarily erudite, his verse often features allusions to French literature, Greek myth, and tragedy, and English poets and poetry stretching from Wallace Stevens to John Donne. He was often described as a &quot;traditionalist&quot;. In &quot;The Hard Hours&quot; (1967), Hecht drew upon his experiences as a soldier in Europe during World War II.

<doc id="1163754" wikidata="Q4115257" url="?curid=1163754" title="Pausa">
<text>In linguistics, pausa (Latin for &#x27;break&#x27;, from Greek παῦσις, &quot;pâusis&quot; &#x27;stopping, ceasing&#x27;) is the hiatus between prosodic declination units. The concept is somewhat broad, as it is primarily used to refer to allophones that occur in certain prosodic environments, and these environments vary between languages.

==Characteristics==
Some sound laws specifically operate only &quot;in pausa&quot;. For example, certain phonemes may be pronounced differently at the beginning or the end of a word if no other word precedes or follows within the same prosodic unit, such as a word in the citation form. That is the case with the final-obstruent devoicing of German, Turkish, Russian, and other languages whose voiced obstruent consonants are devoiced pre-pausa and before voiceless consonants.

The opposite environment is relevant in Spanish, whose voiced fricatives become stops post-pausa and after nasals. Such environments are often termed &quot;pre-pausal&quot; and &quot;post-pausal&quot;, respectively. The phrases &quot;in pausa&quot; and &quot;pausal form&quot; are often taken to mean at the end of a prosodic unit, in pre-pausal position, as pre-pausal effects are more common than post-pausal effects.

Very commonly, such allophones are described as occurring &quot;word-initially&quot; or &quot;word-finally&quot;, as opposed to other allophones found &quot;word-medially&quot;, because that is a more accessible phrasing for most readers. However, that phrasing is accurate only for a word in citation form. It is not always clear in the description of a language whether an alleged word-boundary allophone is actually defined by the word boundary, as opposed to being pausal allophones being defined by prosodic boundaries.

==Examples==
In English, the last stressed syllable before a pausa receives tonic stress, giving the illusion of a distinction between primary and secondary stress. In dialects of English with linking or intrusive R (a type of liaison), the &quot;r&quot; is not realized in pausa even if the following word begins in a vowel. Similarly, French liaison does not operate in pausa.

English words that have weak and strong forms are realized as strong after and often also before a pausa.

In some dialects of English, the voiced fricatives devoice when they are in pausa, making the /z/ a [z̥] in &quot;a loud buzz&quot; but remaining a [z] in &quot;a buzz that&#x27;s loud&quot;.

In Arabic, Biblical Hebrew, other Semitic languages, and Egyptian, pausa affects grammatical inflections. In Arabic, short vowels, including those carrying case, are dropped before a pausa, and the gender is modified. The Arabic alphabet has a letter (&quot;tāʾ marbūṭa&quot; ) for the feminine, which is classically pronounced in pausa but in liaison. In Masoretic Biblical Hebrew, () is the general feminine form of &#x27;to you&#x27; but also the pausal masculine form.

In Spanish, voiced fricative/approximants are pronounced as stops after a pausa and after a nasal.

In Tuscan, the full infinitive form of the verb occurs only pre-pausa.

In Kombe, a word-final high tone becomes low or downstepped in pausa.

In Mehri, emphatic consonants become ejectives pre-pausa.

In Tapieté, epenthesis of [x] occurs when /ɨ/ is in pausa, while epenthesis of [ʔ] occurs when any other vowel is in pausa. So the word /kɨ/ becomes [kɨx] when it is in pausa, and the word /hẽʔẽ/ becomes [hẽʔẽʔ] when it is in pausa.

<doc id="1163769" wikidata="Q7128045" url="?curid=1163769" title="Palm Island, Queensland">
<text>Palm Island is a locality consisting of an island group of 16 islands, split between the Shire of Hinchinbrook and the Aboriginal Shire of Palm Island, in Queensland, Australia. The locality coincides with the geographical entity known as the Palm Island group, also known as the Greater Palm group, originally named the Palm Isles.

However, the term &quot;Palm Island&quot; is most often used to refer to the main island, Great Palm Island, the largest island in the group and the only one with a significant population of permanent residents, most of whom are Aboriginal. The island is also known by the name &quot;Bwgcolman&quot;, meaning &quot;one people from many groups&quot;, derived from an Aboriginal language of one of the earliest groups of Aboriginal people removed from the mainland and settled there from 1918 onwards, during its use as an Aboriginal reserve.

The term &quot;Palm Island&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the island group, sometimes the Aboriginal Shire, and sometimes Great Palm Island, but as most of the other islands are uninhabited, the majority of sources are actually referring to Great Palm only, or to the Aboriginal Shire Council.

Orpheus Island has a tourist resort and research facility, and is the only one with a well-developed tourist industry.

In the , the locality of Palm Island (incorporating all the island in the group) had a population of 2,138 people, of whom 1,918 (89.7%) identify as Indigenous Australians.

== Geography==

There are 16 islands that make up the Greater Palm group, 12 of them named. The islands listed from north to south, are:
* Pelorus Island (North Palm Island, Yanooa, Guyroogarrie) – uninhabited and privately owned
* Orpheus Island (Goolboddi – contains national park, research facility and tourist resort, privately owned)
**Albino Rock is part of Orpheus Island National Park.
* Curacoa Island (Noogoo or Inoogoo) 
* Fantome Island (Eumilli)
* Great Palm Island (Bwgcolman)
* Esk Island (Soopun)
* Falcon Island (Carbooroo)
* Eclipse Island (Garoogubbee)
* Brisk Island (Culgarul)
* Barber Island (Boodthean)
* Fly Island 
* Havannah Island

The group was originally named the &quot;Palm Isles&quot; (see History, below), while other current names for the island group are the Palm Island group and the Greater Palm group. The majority of the islands are micro-islands; the most notable are Great Palm Island (the largest and only one with a permanent population), Fantome Island, and Orpheus Island.

The ocean surrounding the islands is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where extraction and fishing are regulated. Neighbouring islands outside the Palm group include Rattlesnake Island, which is used for Air Force bombing practice, and Magnetic Island, an island suburb of Townsville. The nearest island to the group is Pandora Reef.

Table 1 shows the micro-islands, known as rocks, and their Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) designations.
==Origins==

Today&#x27;s population are descendants of people taken to the Palm Island Aboriginal Settlement from 1914 up to 1971. Estimates vary, but the number of tribal groups represented by the descendants (known as the Bwgcolman people) is at least 43 and has been said to represent 57 different language groups. At least 5000 people were forcibly removed to the reserve from all over Queensland, the Torres Strait and Melanesian islands. The majority of the current population descend from peoples occupying the region between Bowen and Tully, from north-western Queensland, and from the Cape York Peninsula.

==Governance and settlements==
The locality of Palm Island falls in the federal Division of Herbert and the Electoral district of Townsville.

Local government of the islands is split: the two most northerly islands, Pelorus and Orpheus, are in the Shire of Hinchinbrook, while the other ten are in the Aboriginal Shire of Palm Island. Table 2 (below) shows the ten islands of the group in the jurisdiction of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council. The remaining rocks, listed above, are owned by the Commonwealth and are in the jurisdiction of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

Australia Post lists only one postcode for &quot;Palm Island, QLD&quot; (4816), which refers to the island group; there is no formal name for the settled areas of Great Palm Island. The main town has on Great Palm has schools, shops, a football club, hospital and churches. The town area, next to the jetty where the ferries dock, has no formal name, and is still called &quot;the Mission&quot; by some of the locals. It is referred to as &quot;Palm Islands&quot; on the Queensland Government place names database. In addition to the town, there are several small settlement areas to the north and south, but the roads are limited to the western side of the island.

The islands within Palm Island Aboriginal Shire have alcohol restrictions: the maximum amount of alcohol a person can carry in the restricted area is of any liquor with a concentration of less than 4 per cent. While it is not a completely dry zone, &quot;sly grog&quot; sales are not permitted and penalties apply for breaches of the law. There is one licensed premises in the restricted area, the Coolgaree Bay Sports Bar and Bistro, where alcohol can only be sold for on-premises or off-premises consumption to a patron with a valid membership card.
&lt;br&gt;

==Climate==

Lying in the tropical zone, the islands&#x27; climate is tropical and the area is vulnerable to cyclones.

==History==
===Pre-contact ===
The Manbarra people are the traditional owners of Great Palm and nearby islands. In Manbarra beliefs the Palm Island group were formed in the Dreamtime from the broken up fragments of an ancestral spirit, Rainbow Serpent. Manbarra (also known as Wulgurukaba) is a language of the Palm Island region, which lies within the local government boundaries of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council.

In the Hinchinbrook shire, the traditional owners of Orpheus Island were the Nywaigi, while the Warakamai inhabited Hinchinbrook Island.

The islands in the area were named the &quot;Palm Isles&quot; by explorer James Cook in 1770 as he sailed up the eastern coast of Australia on his first voyage. It is estimated that the population of the island at the time of Cook&#x27;s visit was about 200 Manbarra people. Cook sent some of his men to Palm Island and &quot;they returned on board having met with nothing worth observing&quot;.

In 1819, Captain Phillip Parker King landed on one of the islands and recorded seeing recently occupied circular huts, and canoes nearby their landing place.

===(Great) Palm Island history===

Great Palm Island has always been the most populated island. It is estimated that the population of the island at the time of Cook&#x27;s 1770 visit was about 200 people. From the 1850s, locals were enticed away to join bêche-de-mer and pearling enterprises with Europeans and Japanese, and by the end of the 19th century the population had been reduced to about 50.

In 1914, the Palm Island Aboriginal Settlement was created by the Queensland Government, and relocated people from 1918 all over Queensland, starting with Hull River Mission residents after the mission was destroyed by a cyclone. People from up to 57 language groups were moved there. In the first two decades of its existence, the number of residents rose from 200 to 1,630. It was regarded as a penal settlement, with people being sent there for perceived wrongdoing, and soon it became the largest government Aboriginal reserve in Queensland.

St George&#x27;s Anglican Church was built in 1931 from palm leaves and grass (approx ). On Wednesday 4 July 1935, a new timber St George&#x27;s Anglican Church was opened and dedicated by Bishop John Feetham.

During World War II, the Naval Air Station Palm Island (aka Palm Island Airfield) was built at Wallaby Point in 1943 by the US Navy’s 55 Construction Battalion (Seabees). It was a seaplane maintenance facility with a concrete slipway which was predominantly used to serve PBY Catalina flying boats.

St Anthony&#x27;s Catholic Church in the Parish of St Anne was blessed and opened on Sunday 6 August 1961 by Bishop H. E. Ryan. It was designed and built from stone by Townsville consulting engineers, Ariotti and Norman. It is at 26 Banfield Drive (within the grounds of the Catholic school, ).

The women&#x27;s dormitory closed in 1967 and was demolished in 1969. The children&#x27;s dormitories were officially closed on 5 December 1975.

====1978: Sacking of the Aboriginal Council====
The Aboriginal Council of Palm Island was sacked by Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s government in July 1978. This followed moves by the Queensland Government to hand over control of Palm Island to Townsville Council, which was opposed by islanders in a petition instigated by Labor senator Jim Keeffe. Denis Freney, writing in &quot;Tribune&quot;, reported that the decision was made based on a counter-petition run by the government which contained many signatures of Aboriginal people which had been forged or obtained by duplicity, and was &quot;part of a plan by the Bjelke-Petersen government to ride roughshod over the wishes of the 1305 residents of the island and open it up to property speculators and tourist development&quot;. He wrote that both petitions contained many of the same people&#x27;s signatures.

====1999: Compensation by Queensland Government for underpaid wages====

In 1999 the Queensland Government apologised and gave compensation each to former Palm Islander employees in recompense for underpaid wages between 1975 and 1986. The payment was ordered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a case first brought to the commission by seven Palm Islanders in 1986.

====2004: Death in custody and consequences====
On 19 November 2004, Palm Island resident Mulrunji (known as Cameron Doomadgee while alive), aged 36 or 37, died in a police cell on Palm Island, one hour after being picked up for allegedly causing a public nuisance. After the post-mortem report said that the cause of death was severe internal injuries, riots occurred, and as a result, a number of people were charged with offences.

Two coronial inquests were held, a police officer was tried for manslaughter, but acquitted on 20 June 2007. The Crime and Misconduct Commission examined police relations in Queensland and as part of this, conducted an inquiry into police handling of the Mulrunji investigation. In 2010 it reported that more work was needed on police relations, while noting that some improvement had occurred, recommending 51 specific actions.

The police raids and behaviour following the riot were found in December 2016 to have breached the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;, with a record class action settlement of awarded to victims in May 2018. The raids were found by the court to be &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;unnecessary, disproportionate&quot; with police having &quot;acted in these ways because they were dealing with an Aboriginal community&quot;.

===Fantome Island medical facilities (1926–1973)===

In 1926 a lock hospital was built on Fantome Island; Aboriginal people were sent there mainly for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. In 1937 Fantome Island became a medical clearing station, where Aboriginal people sent to Palm Island were examined and treated if necessary. A leprosarium was established on Fantome in 1939.

The hospital was closed in 1945, and the leprosarium in 1973, when the inhabitants were moved to (Great) Palm Island.

===2004: Legal action relating to pearl farming===

Zen Pearls Pty Ltd and Indian Pacific Pearls Pty Ltd (both controlled by Michael Crimp) established pearl farms in 1998 with the permission of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (which controls the sea waters around the islands), despite the opposition of, at least some, of the people of Palm Island. On 24 September 1998 the Manbarra elders passed a resolution opposing the farms on the basis of;

&quot;the historical and cultural significance of the Juno Bay site for both the Manbarra and Bwgcolman Peoples, the sense of trespass on traditional ownership rights, concerns that the cultural connection to the area would slip away and a strong feeling that the provision of a small number of employment opportunities offered by the pearling operations would not adequately compensate the damage to cultural values.&quot;
Subsequently, the Park Authority refused to extend the pearl farming permits and Crimp took action before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have this decision reversed. On 15 March 2004 the Tribunal agreed that the permits should be terminated but allowed the existing pearling operations to continue to 1 December 2005. This decision was substantially upheld by the Federal Court on 21 October 2004.

== Demographics ==
The Indigenous population generally identify with either the Bwgcolman (descendants of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people removed to Palm Island from throughout Queensland by the authorities, or Manbarra (original inhabitants) people. , the community consisted of approximately 42 Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander clan or family groups.

In the , the locality of Palm Island had a population of 2,455 people, of whom 74.5% identify as Australian Aboriginal and 12.8% identify as Torres Strait Islander. The Palm Island community was younger than Australians as a whole, with 32.0% under 15 and only 3.3% over 64, and they were more religious. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 50.4%, Anglican 19.4%, Other Protestant 8.5%, Baptist 5.0% (total 91.2% Christian) and No Religion 8.1% (compared with 29.2% for Queensland). 92.2% of respondents reported speaking only English at home (compared with 81.2% for Queensland), the next most common being Yumplatok (Torres Strait Creole) at 0.2%. 702 people were in the available workforce: of these, 38.6% were employed full-time, 28.3% were employed part-time and 29.1% were unemployed. The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and over was (compared with in Queensland). 93.8% of occupied private dwellings were rented. Level of education achieved was much lower than Queensland as a whole, with only a tiny number having any higher or further education.

In the , the locality of Palm Island had a population of 2,138 people, of whom 1,918 (89.7%) identify as Indigenous Australians.

==Education==
Palm Island Settlement State School opened in 1926, but closed in 1927. A mission school operated on the island in 1930s. In 1962, Palm Island Settlement School opened, being renamed Palm Island State School, and in 1994 was renamed Bwgcolman Community School.

The Sisters of Our Lady Help of Christians established St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Convent in 1934. They established a temporary Catholic school in October 1934 with 97 students, but a lack of funds prevented the establishment of a permanent Catholic school until 1938. St Michael&#x27;s Catholic School was blessed on Sunday 24 July 1938 by the Apostolic Delegate Giovanni (John) Panico. In 1945, the Sisters of Our Lady Help of Christians were replaced by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. In 1969, the school was relocated as it was in the way of the development of the airport. From 1979 to 1991, the school was under lay leadership, before the Sisters of the Good Samaritan took over in 1992.

Palm Island Provisional School opened in 1938 for the children of the white officials on the island. It closed in 1970.

As at 2022, there are two schools on Palm Island, both on Great Palm Island.

Bwgcolman Community School is an Indigenous community primary and secondary (Early Childhood-12) school for boys and girls at Creek Road (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 249 students with 30 teachers and 28 non-teaching staff (23 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

St Michael&#x27;s Catholic School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Banfield Highway (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 101 students with 8 teachers and 13 non-teaching staff (12 full-time equivalent).

Bwgcolman Indigenous Knowledge Centre (IKC) is owned and operated by the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council (PIASC), providing a community space that builds community capacity through combining library services with a range of training, learning and information activities. These activities enable access to information knowledge and culture, developing the capacity of community members to participate in social and economic opportunities. The IKC has played a vital role as a historical information centre, connecting local community, and visitors with historical connections, with family history records.

==Transport==
Sealink Queensland runs a ferry every day from Townsville to Great Palm Island each day of the week except Tuesday, with the journey taking around an hour and 15 minutes. There is also a daily ferry and barge from Lucinda. Palm Island Airport is on Great Palm Island and is operated by the shire council. Hinterland Aviation operates several flights on each weekday between 7am and 4:30pm, and Townsville Helicopters operates on-demand helicopter flights to and from Palm Island, also from Townsville Airport.

There is a daily scheduled helicopter flight from Townsville to the luxury resort on Orpheus Island and back, and private helicopter charter flights are available from Townsville, Cairns or other nearby facilities.

==Tourism==
In the locality of Palm Island, only Orpheus Island has a well-developed tourist industry, based around a private luxury resort, the Orpheus Island Lodge.

Some attempts have been made to develop a tourist industry on Great Palm Island, but these have met with limited success. Although the island has tropical rainforest and is rich in diverse flora and fauna, is close to the Great Barrier Reef and its waters abound with tropical fish, making it an ideal spot for eco-tourism, there have been concerns owing to its troubled history and social problems, and its residents need to be ready to embrace the idea of a possible flood of visitors. There are, however some facilities and accommodation on the large island for tourists, such as Klub Kuda. The Palm Island Motel is operated by the council.

==Notable people==
===The Clays===

Iris Clay (1936–1979) and her husband Frederick William (Fred, or Freddie) Clay (1927–1983) were Indigenous leaders and activists who fought for equality for the people of Palm Island. Iris worked for the Aboriginal Legal Service on Palm Island, and was a founding member as well as director of Aboriginal Hostels Limited.

&quot;Freddie and Ivy (sic) Clay&quot; were recorded as having been moved to Palm Island in 1935 from Cloncurry. Ivy arrived with her parents and some, but not all, of her siblings in the 1930s. At the age of 15, Fred escaped to the mainland, and got as far as Ingham before he was captured at gunpoint and returned to the reserve. Fred became a boxer around 1950, participating in a match at the Brisbane Stadium in May 1950 (recorded as aged 19?). He was an activist by 1969, when Aboriginal people were not allowed on the main street.

Fred became a councillor on Palm Island Council, including a stint as chairman from 1973 to 1974. During this time, the council sought to obtain federal government funding so that Palm Islanders could run their own affairs, and develop the island&#x27;s economy themselves, instead of decisions about the people coming under Queensland&#x27;s oppressive &quot;Aborigines Act 1971&quot; and the &quot;Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971&quot;. He was president of the council at the time of its sacking by the Bjelke-Petersen government in July 1978, and later deported from the island, along with Bill Rosser (see below).

Clay Street in the suburb of Bonner, Australian Capital Territory, was named in honour of Iris and Fred Clay in 2009. In 2014, the Frederick William Clay Park was opened on the foreshore of the town on Palm Island.

===Bill Rosser===
Bill Rosser, aka B. R. Rosser (13 May 1927 – May 2002), author of &quot;This is Palm Island&quot; (1978), &quot;Return to Palm Island&quot; (1994) and many other books, was also a union organiser. He visited Palm Island at the invitation of Iris Clay (whom he had met at the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Townsville) in 1974, and was shocked at the extent to which the life of Aboriginal people was prescribed by the Queensland laws.

Rosser, Fred Clay and others tried started a newsletter called &quot;Smoke Signal&quot; (aka &quot;Palm Island Smoke Signal&quot;) in 1974, describing the life of Aboriginal people under the current legislation. The newsletter ran for at least 12 issues. Clay and Rosser were subsequently deported from the island.

Rosser later produced another publication for Aboriginal people, called &quot;Black Knight&quot;, in Brisbane (1975).

<text>Butterfly watching is a hobby concerned with the observation and study of butterflies. It also includes the &quot;catch and release&quot; of butterflies. There are clubs, handbooks, checklists, and festivals devoted to the activity.

The Canada Day and Fourth of July annual butterfly count, a census of species by butterfly watchers throughout North America, is an example of citizen science.

== Equipment used ==
* Low-power binoculars (7x35, for example), especially close-focus binoculars are helpful
* A butterfly field guide. Not all butterflies are readily identifiable from color photographs. The skippers, for example, are best identified from set specimens.
* A camera (optional)

==Locations==
A person can watch butterflies almost everywhere but some well-known butterfly-watching areas include Costa Rica, the Amazon Basin, and sub-Saharan Africa.

== Counting butterflies ==
Projects in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands, North America, and other countries provide a framework for reporting butterfly sightings in an attempt to understand the factors that threaten or favor European butterflies.

<text>The black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons) is a tropical fish belonging to the ghost knifefish family (Apteronotidae). They originate in freshwater habitats in South America where they range from Venezuela to the Paraguay–Paraná River, including the Amazon Basin. They are popular in aquaria. The fish is all black except for two white rings on its tail, and a white blaze on its nose, which can occasionally extend into a stripe down its back. It moves mainly by undulating a long fin on its underside. It will grow to a length of .

Black ghost knifefish are nocturnal. They are a weakly electric fish which use an electric organ and receptors distributed over the length of their body in order to locate prey, including insect larvae.

==Natural habitat==
The black ghost knifefish natively lives in sandy bottom creeks in South America. Natives believe that the ghosts of the departed take up residence in these fish, hence the name.

==In aquaria==
Black ghost knifefish require a medium sized tank of when smaller, though as they grow larger will require a much larger tank of around . A lid is needed as they have been known to jump out. Black Ghost knifefish get to a maximum size of in the wild, but usually stop growing at in home aquaria, although they may grow to in a larger tank. They should be provided with a shelter (such as a plastic tube or driftwood) in which to hide. They prefer a dimly lit tank as their eyesight is optimized for low light. Black ghost knife fish are weakly electric fish. They will eat smaller fish in the tank and are intolerant of conspecifics. As with other scaleless fish, they are vulnerable to parasite infestations such as ich (&quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot;). They can reproduce in captivity, although there are only a few reports of Black Ghost Knifefish reproducing. It is possible to use a device to convert a captive fish&#x27;s electrical signals into audible sound, allowing listeners to hear the fish &quot;talk&quot;. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis has a display with such a device and a black ghost knifefish.
==Electricity==
The black ghost knifefish is a weakly electric fish as a result of the electromotor and electrosensory systems it possesses. While some fish can only receive electric signals, the black ghost knifefish can both produce and sense the electrical impulses. Electrogenesis occurs when a specialized electric organ found in the tail of the fish generates electrical signals, which are thus called electric organ discharges (EODs). Then, for these EODs to be sensed by the fish, electroreception occurs when groups of sensory cells embedded in the skin, known as electroreceptor organs, detect the electrical change. The EODs are used for two major purposes: electrolocation and communication.

The kind of EOD produced can be used to distinguish between two types of weakly electric fish: the pulse-type and the wave-type. The black ghost knifefish are considered to be the latter type, because they can continuously generate EODs in small intervals. Wave-type EODs have a narrow power spectra, and can be heard as a tonal sound, where the discharge rate establishes the fundamental frequency. By emitting its own continuous sinusoidal train of EODs, the fish can determine the presence of nearby objects by sensing perturbations in timing and amplitude of electric fields, an ability known as active electrolocation. The particular organs used to sense the self-generated high-frequency EODs are tuberous electroreceptor organs. On the other hand, when low-frequency electric fields are generated by external sources instead of the fish itself, a different class of electroreceptor organs is used for this passive electrolocation, called ampullary organs. Therefore, the black ghost knifefish uses an active and a passive electrosystem, each with its own corresponding receptor organs. The fish can also use a mechanosensory lateral line system, which detects water disturbances created by the motion of the fish&#x27;s body. As nocturnal hunters, the fish can rely on all three systems to navigate through dark environments and detect their prey. 

Each species has a characteristic EOD baseline frequency range, which varies with sex and age within the species, as well. The baseline frequency is maintained to be almost constant at stable temperature, but will usually be changed due to the presence of others of the same species. Such changes in frequency relevant to social interaction are called frequency modulations (FMs). The role these FMs have in communication is significant, as black ghost knifefish have developed jamming avoidance responses, which are behavioral responses that avoid the overlapping of EOD frequencies between conspecific individuals to prevent sensory confusion. Moreover, a study was conducted that focused on sexual dimorphism in electrocommunication signals. Female black ghost knifefish generate EODs at a higher frequency than the males, an FM which can be used for gender recognition. A study found the subordinate black ghost knifefish exhibited noticeable gradual frequency rises (GFRs) in their EODs whereas the dominant fish did not, supporting the researchers&#x27; hypothesis that GFRs during communication are indicative of submissive signals.

<doc id="1163782" wikidata="Q1077297" url="?curid=1163782" title="Zzap!64">
<text>Zzap!64 is a computer games magazine covering games for computers manufactured by Commodore International, especially the Commodore 64 (C64). It was published in the UK by Newsfield Publications Ltd and later by Europress Impact.

The magazine launched in April, with the cover date May 1985, as the sister magazine to &quot;CRASH&quot;. It focused on the C64 for much of its shelf life, but later incorporated Amiga game news and reviews. Like &quot;CRASH&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, it had a dedicated cult following amongst C64 owners and was well known for its irreverent sense of humour as well as its extensive, detailed coverage of the C64 scene. The magazine adopted an innovative review system that involved the use of the reviewers&#x27; faces, artistically rendered by in-house artists Oli Frey and Mark Kendrick, to express their reaction to the games. These eventually evolved into static cartoons as the magazine began catering for a younger market. High-quality games were indicated in reviews via the &quot;Gold Medal&quot; award, the logo was used as a selling point for games, big and small.

By 1992, the magazine had changed so dramatically in design and editorial direction that then-publisher Europress decided to relaunch the magazine. Thus, issue 91 of &quot;Zzap!64&quot; became issue 1 of &quot;Commodore Force&quot;, a magazine that itself lasted until March 1994.

==History==
The first issue of &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, dated May 1985, was released on 11 April 1985. Its inaugural editorial team included editor Chris Anderson, Software Editor Bob Wade, freelance writer Steve Cooke (who joined the staff from the recently folded &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot;), and reviewers Gary Penn and Julian Rignall, who won their jobs after having placed as finalists at a video game competition. The editorial headquarters was in Yeovil, more than 120 miles from Newsfield&#x27;s headquarters in Ludlow; the team was relocated to Ludlow after three months to cut costs, and Anderson and Wade left the staff after declining to make the move. Anderson would later found Future Publishing and the TED Conference.

As the Amiga gained popularity in the UK, &quot;Zzap!64&quot; began to publish occasional reviews of Amiga games. The Amiga coverage became a fixed feature of the magazine in issue 43 (November 1988), when the title was renamed to &quot;Zzap!64 Amiga&quot;.

The magazine experienced controversy in 1989, when three out of four reviewers (Gordon Houghton, Kati Hamza and Maff Evans) were fired and replaced during production of issue 50 (June 1989). The only one remaining, Paul Rand, had been employed at &quot;Zzap!64&quot; a mere two months. Issue 50&#x27;s editorial mentioned nothing of what happened, and the issue featured content from the three fired reviewers without discussing their fates.

Issue 74 (June 1991) saw the dropping of all Amiga coverage (the word &quot;Amiga&quot; was dropped from the name in 1990), and the magazine became completely devoted to the C64 once more. Four months later the publisher Newsfield declared bankruptcy and publication was suspended for a month. Europress Impact (a satellite company of Europress launched by Roger Kean, Oliver Frey and Jonathan Rignall) became the new publisher of &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, beginning with issue 79 (December 1991).

Issue 90 (November 1992) was the last official &quot;Zzap!64&quot; issue. From the following month, the magazine was replaced by &quot;Commodore Force&quot;.

===In Italy===
The Italian edition (just titled &quot;Zzap!&quot;), authorised by the original publisher, was not limited to Commodore 64 games, but it also reviewed games for other 8-bit machines like the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC, and Atari 8-bit computers. Around 80% of the content was translated with the remainder written in Italy. From issue 1 (May 1986) to issue 73 (December 1992) it was released as an actual magazine; with issue 74 (January 1993) it became an inset of the Italian version of The Games Machine until December 1993 when it stopped being published.

From 1996 to 1999, &quot;Zzap!&quot; became an online magazine, a PC gaming website with a different &quot;cover&quot; each month and a mailbag, which reviewed games with the same style of the original magazine.

In 2002, a special &quot;issue 85&quot;, dedicated to then recently released games for 8-bit machines, was released in PDF format.

In 2021, the &quot;Airons&quot; cultural association in Vigevano resumed the publication of a new &quot;Zzap!&quot; magazine, founded by a group of former editors. The magazine is published aperiodically and only sent via mail to the members; it focuses on retrogaming and new games for 8- and 16-bit systems, still made by enthusiasts and small independent software houses.

==Commemorative issues==
In March 2002, a special &quot;Issue 107&quot; of &quot;Zzap!64&quot; was published digitally in PDF format, later receiving a limited print run of 200 copies. Originally intended as a fan project based on a suggestion by journalist Cameron Davis in a &quot;Zzap!64&quot; discussion forum, a number of ex-Newsfield writers later volunteered to join the project, including former editors Gordon Houghton, Robin Hogg and Paul Glancey.

The special issue reflected the C64&#x27;s continuing popularity in the 21st century as a platform for retro gamers and hobbyists, with the majority of reviews focusing on recently released C64 games. The magazine&#x27;s design was based on &quot;classic era&quot; &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, and the front cover was based on an illustration by former Newsfield artist Oli Frey, significantly revised by designer Craig Grannell.

Another special issue of &quot;Zzap!64&quot; was created in July 2005 to celebrate the magazine&#x27;s twentieth anniversary. Dubbed &quot;The Def Tribute to Zzap!64&quot;, it was professionally printed and given away with issue 18 of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine. Although more celebratory and retrospective in design than issue 107, it nevertheless featured a great deal of new content, including a foreword and articles by former Newsfield director and &quot;Zzap!64&quot; editor Roger Kean and new material from former editors Gary Penn and Chris Anderson. The front cover and centerfold featured rare illustrations by Oli Frey from his pre-Newsfield days.

Fusion Retro Books licensed the rights to use the ZZAP! and Crash trademarks from Future Publishing, creating a series of Annuals funded through Kickstarter and published in time for Christmas. Roger Kean was involved in editing and compiling the issues alongside Chris Wilkins. The Annuals up to 2022 featured new and specially commissioned Oli Frey cover artwork.

Fusion Retro Books then negotiated the transfer of the remaining Newsfield trademarks for future use.

Since March 2021, a new bimonthly volume of Zzap! 64 has been available through Patreon subscriptions. This is a 66-page A5 magazine, published bi-monthly by Fusion Retro Books. Original staff member Robin Hogg is part of the reviewing team, with artist Simon Butler contributing the regular Gallery section looking at artwork. The Technical Bit In The Middle now focuses on modern hardware and other upgrades for the computer, with a regular section dedicated to the MEGA65 computer.

<text>The City of Vancouver Book Award is a Canadian literary award, that has been presented annually by the city of Vancouver, British Columbia to one or more works of literature judged as the year&#x27;s best fiction, non-fiction, poetry or drama work about the city.

As with the City of Toronto Book Award, the award may go to one or more books.

The award has a monetary value of $3,000. The prize is funded by interest earned from the city&#x27;s publishing reserve, which was established in 1977 as a permanent legacy for writers and publishers. The fund received royalties generated from &quot;Vancouver&#x27;s First Century: A Photo History of Vancouver&quot;, edited by city staff. The third edition of the book, renamed &quot;Vancouver: A City Album&quot;, or many years generated royalty payments for the fund.

<text>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country&#x27;s currency. Such fluctuations may change a country&#x27;s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.

==List==
This is a sortable list of all European countries by their gross domestic product in billions of US dollars at market or official government exchange rates (nominal GDP), according to the International Monetary Fund. The economic and political map of Europe also includes: Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus and Kosovo.

<text>David Euan Wallace, MC PC (20 April 1892 – 9 February 1941) was a British Conservative politician who was an ally of Neville Chamberlain and briefly served as Minister of Transport during World War II.

==Early life==
Wallace was born on 20 April 1892. He was the son of John Wallace, of Glassingall, Dunblane, Perthshire. His paternal grandparents were David Wallace, an ironmaster, and Janet (née Weir) Wallace. His aunt, Edith Wallace, was the wife of Maj. Robert Dunbar Sinclair-Wemyss.

He was educated at Harrow before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Career==
In 1911, Wallace joined the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards Reserve, gaining the rank of Captain, serving as adjutant from 1915 to 1918. He was decorated with the award of the Military Cross (MC) after being wounded four times during the Great War.

After the War, he became assistant Military Attaché at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. He acted as a special Commissioner for the North-East coast and acted as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Governor General of Canada in 1920.

===Political career===
He was first elected to the House of Commons at Member of Parliament (MP) for Rugby from 1922 to 1923, then represented Hornsey from 1924 until his death in 1941 (when he was considered one of the richest members of the House of Commons). He served as Assistant Government Whip from 1928 to 1929; Junior Lord of the Treasury in 1929 and 1931; Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1931 to 1934; Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1935 to 1935; Secretary for Overseas Trade from 1935 to 1937; Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1937 to 1938; Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1938 to 1939. On 21 April 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Wallace the Minister of Transport.

Wallace was invested as a Privy Counsellor by King Edward VIII in June 1936, along with Lt.-Col. David John Colville (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland) and, his former brother-in-law, Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr (Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education).

==Personal life==
Wallace was twice married and the father of five sons, four of whom died while serving in the military. On 26 November 1913 Wallace married Lady (Myra) Idina Sackville, daughter of The 8th Earl De La Warr and Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey. Lady Idina designed Kildonan House in Barrhill, South Ayrshire with the architect James Miller in homage to her childhood home, but they separated before it was completed. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1919, they were the parents of two sons:

* David John Wallace MC (1914–1944), a Major in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps who was killed in action during World War II while serving with the Special Operations Executive in Greece (during the Battle of Menina) and who married Joan Prudence Magor, a daughter of Richard Magor of Chelmsford, in 1939. 
* Gerard Euan Wallace (1915–1943), a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve who was killed in a flying accident in Kenya in August 1943, aged 27 and who married Mary Elizabeth Koch de Gooreynd, née Lawson, in November 1940.

On 10 May 1920, he was married to Barbara Lutyens (1898–1981), the daughter of architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (a daughter of Edith Villiers and The 1st Earl of Lytton, the Viceroy of India and British Ambassador to France). Together, they were the parents of three sons:

* John Wallace (1922–1946), a Lieutenant in the Life Guards who died, unmarried, as a result of a general anaesthetic during a nose operation, while on active service.
* Edward Peter Wallace DFC (1923–1944), a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve who was killed in action during World War II. He was unmarried.
* William Euan &quot;Billy&quot; Wallace (1927–1977), who was educated at Eton and University College, Oxford, and was a former escort of Princess Margaret, whom he had known since childhood. He married the Hon. Elizabeth Anne Hoyer Millar, daughter of The 1st Baron Inchyra and Anna de Marees van Swinderen (the daughter of Dutch diplomat René de Marees van Swinderen), in 1965. Princess Margaret, by then married to Antony Armstrong-Jones, attended the wedding.

He inherited a coal and iron fortune estimated at more than £2,000,000.

After undergoing a serious operation before Christmas 1940, Wallace died on 9 February 1941. His widow, who married Herbert Agar (the American journalist who was editor of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;) in 1945, lived another forty years before her death in 1981.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest son David, he was a grandfather of two: Laura Jacqueline Wallace (b. 1941), who married Dominic Paul Morland (a son of Sir Oscar Charles Morland GBE KCMG, of Pickering, Yorkshire and Alice Lindley) in 1963, they divorced and she married, secondly, Keith Fitchett, in 2003; and Cary Davina Wallace (b. 1942), who married David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford.

<doc id="1163793" wikidata="Q5190372" url="?curid=1163793" title="Cry (Faith Hill album)">
<text>Cry is the fifth studio album by American country music singer Faith Hill. It was released on October 15, 2002, via Warner Bros. Nashville. The album was Hill&#x27;s attempt at expanding her crossover appeal that she had garnered with hits like &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot;. Hill co-produced the album along with Marti Frederiksen, Byron Gallimore, and Dann Huff.

Upon its release, &quot;Cry&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, with Hill&#x27;s decision to focus on pop and R&amp;B influences while largely abandoning the country sound of her previous album being divided over. Despite this, the album went on break a record for the highest first week sales by a female country artist, debuting atop both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums chart with first week sales of 467,000 copies sold in its first week. It would go on to sell four million copies worldwide and was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA, a moderate success compared to her previous album &quot;Breathe&quot; (1999), which was certified 8× Platinum.

Five singles in total were released. The title track, &quot;Cry&quot;, was released in August 2002 and despite debuting at number 32 on the US Hot Country Songs, it only peaked at number 12, marking her lowest-peaking lead single to the format. Country radio was hesitant to play songs from the album and as such, follow-up singles released like &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still Here&quot; failed to be successful. &quot;One&quot; was exclusively released to the adult contemporary format while &quot;Baby You Belong&quot; was released exclusively to Japan to promote the 2002 Disney film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. The album was negatively reviewed at country radio, with many programmers claiming Hill had &quot;abandoned&quot; the genre. Hill was heavily compared to Celine Dion in terms of the move of genres, which was also negatively reviewed.

At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004, the album received two nominations: Best Country Album and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the title track, winning the latter award. &quot;Cry&quot; would later be ranked at number 179 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 album of the 2000&#x27;s decade. In a retrospective interview from 2005 while promoting her following album &quot;Fireflies&quot; (2005), Hill told &quot;Billboard&quot; that &quot;it was definitely a different record,&quot; but that she is still &quot;so proud of [the album].&quot; The album, along with works by fellow female artists LeAnn Rimes (&quot;Twisted Angel&quot;), Shania Twain (&quot;Up!&quot;), and Lee Ann Womack (&quot;Something Worth Leaving Behind&quot;), were seen as albums that struggled the most at country radio due to how they tried to appeal to both pop and country, but failed to have major success in either genre. Hill, in particular, was questioned if she was &quot;selling out&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1999, Hill released her fourth studio album &quot;Breathe&quot; (1999). Commercially, the album was very successful, debuting atop both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts. It spawned crossover hits such as &quot;Breathe&quot;, which satisfied both pop and country audiences, and &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot;, with the former becoming the number-one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Year-End list for 2000. This success was what led her to win the Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist award at the 2000 American Music Awards. She also garnered a hit song from the 2001 Michael Bay-directed film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot;, which became her most successful song in Europe. This success swayed Hill to make a more pop-friendly album. While she still stuck with her previous producers Byron Gallimore and Dann Huff, she also brought in Marti Frederiksen, who is most well-known for his work with Aerosmith, to produce the title track. With this record, Hill dived into genres such as gospel and R&amp;B.

== Songs ==
The album opens up with the song &quot;Free&quot;, which YouTuber Todd In The Shadows, in a retrospective review for the album, called &quot;white woman funk&quot;. Lyrically, Hill recalls having a &quot;poor self-image as a child, and developing confidence thanks to faith and angelic comfort.&quot; The title track, &quot;Cry&quot;, was to initially have featured Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. On &quot;Cry&quot;, Hill sings about wishing a partner to display emotion after a breakup. The Pink and Linda Perry penned song &quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Fly Away&quot; shows Hill singing about offering encouragement and prayer support; Hill&#x27;s vocals in this song were compared to girl group En Vogue. &quot;I Think I Will&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot; both show Hill singing about the recognition of inner strength; on the former song, she also sings about &quot;wanting to make the world a better place&quot;. &quot;Unsaveable&quot; has a unique Motown-inspired groove. &quot;This Is Me&quot;, a song that has influences of country rock, has a similar distinct sound to Jessica Andrews&#x27; 2001 hit song &quot;Who I Am&quot; most likely due to both the songs sharing the same writer, Troy Verges. On the song &quot;One&quot;, she takes inspiration from Barbra Streisand; lyrically, it speaks of longing to restore intimacy in a &quot;too-busy&quot; relationship. &quot;Baby You Belong&quot; lyrically points to either a romantic relationship or a mother-child relationship due to its vagueness. The closing track, &quot;You&#x27;re Still Here&quot; is a heartbreak song where Hill delivers the words with &quot;a crackle in her voice.&quot;; it is about a departed loved one that Hill feels nearby.

== Singles ==
&quot;Cry&quot;, the title track, was first issued on August 8, 2002 as a digital download to country radio. It was officially released to the format on August 19, 2002, as the lead single to the album. It debuted at number 32 on the US Hot Country Songs chart with less than four days of airplay, becoming Hill&#x27;s then-highest debut and the highest debuting single of the year; the record was broken when Shania Twain debuted at number 24 with &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot;. Despite a strong debut, it only peaked at number 12 on September 21, 2002. This, in turn, became her first lead single to miss the top ten; her previous lowest peaking lead single was with &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Vegas&quot; for &quot;It Matters to Me&quot; (1995), which peaked at number five on the October 21, 1995 issue. However, &quot;Cry&quot; proved to have much more success in the adult contemporary market, peaking atop the Adult Contemporary chart for 11 consecutive weeks. Internationally, the song peaked at number three in Canada while reaching the top twenty in Hungary, New Zealand, Spain, Norway, and Romania. The Mike Lipscombe-directed music video would garner Hill two nominations at the 2003 CMT Flameworthy Awards for Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year.

The second single, &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, was released on November 18, 2002, as the second single to the album. It debuted at number 53 the week of November 23, 2002, thanks in part to a performance at the 2002 CMA Awards. It peaked at number 26 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Hill&#x27;s first single since &quot;But I Will&quot; back in 1994 to miss the top-twenty of the chart. Exclusively released to German speaking Europe, it peaked at numbers 52 and 64 in Austria and Germany. The video would win the award for Hottest Female Video of the Year at the 2003 CMT Flameworthy Awards.

&quot;Baby You Belong&quot; was exclusively released to Japan on March 8, 2003. It was released in the country to promote the 2002 Disney film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;; the song was included in the Japanese version&#x27;s soundtrack. It failed to enter the charts there.

The fourth single, &quot;One&quot;, was exclusively released to US adult and hot adult contemporary radio on April 7, 2003. The song performed moderately well, peaking at number seven on the Adult Contemporary chart. It also briefly charted at number 38 on the Adult Top 40 chart.

&quot;You&#x27;re Still Here&quot; was released on April 28, 2003, as the fifth and final song from the record. It peaked at number 28 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Cry&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on 8 reviews. Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Hill for taking stylistic risks but conceded that the album &quot;invites some of the criticism that will inevitably come its way.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Cry&quot; is a confident effort, with Hill laying claim as queen of&quot; pop-country, however the magazine also described the songs as &quot;sometimes bland&quot; and &quot;repetitive.&quot; AllMusic writer Robert L. Doerschuk was ambivalent towards the album&#x27;s production, writing that &quot;her established skills as a song interpreter are lost in all this sturm und drang and her voice, while undeniably powerful at its peak, doesn&#x27;t have the range that allows most singers in this style... to at least milk the material.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the album to be &quot;contrived&quot; and impersonal, with Barry Walters writing, &quot;[Hill is] an expert in the yelps and sighs that signify pop passion, and what she lacks in personality she makes up for with power, professionalism and unfailing hooks.&quot; Robert Hillburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was particularly critical, rating the album one-and-a-half stars out of four. &quot;The songs ... are mediocre,&quot; he writes, &quot;her vocals are rarely convincing, and the arrangements are ham-fisted.&quot;

In a piece commemorating &quot;Cry&quot;&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Billy Dukes of &quot;Taste of Country&quot; theorized that most of the polarizing opinions on the album were a result of the &quot;building tension&quot; at the time between country &quot;purists&quot; and listeners who liked Hill&#x27;s contemporary pop influences.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Cry&quot; debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart and the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated November 2, 2002. The album sold over 472,000 copies in its first week, marking the highest first week sales of Hill&#x27;s career and also setting a new record for the largest first-week sales figure by a solo female country artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991; the record was later broken just a few weeks later when fellow country singer Shania Twain would debuted at number one with over 874,000 copies sold first week for her 2002 album &quot;Up!&quot;. It would only spend one week at number one on the Billboard 200 and only spent 39 weeks total, Hill&#x27;s second shortest chart run with a solo album. On the country charts, it would spend three non-consecutive weeks at number one and overall 63 weeks on the chart to date; &quot;Cry&quot; is one of only two of Hill&#x27;s solo albums to not spend at least 100 weeks on the country charts.

<text>Lyndhurst is a large village and civil parish situated in the New Forest National Park in Hampshire, England, about nine miles () south-west of Southampton. Known as the &quot;Capital of the New Forest&quot;, Lyndhurst houses the New Forest District Council and Court of Verderers. It is also a popular tourist attraction, with many independent shops, art galleries, cafés, museums, pubs and hotels. As of 2001 Lyndhurst had a population of 2,973, increasing to 3,029 at the 2011 Census.

The name derives from an Old English name, comprising the words &quot;lind&quot; (lime tree) and &quot;hyrst&quot; (wooded hill). The first mention of Lyndhurst was in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name &#x27;Linhest&#x27;. The church of St. Michael and All Angels was built in the 1860s, and contains a fresco by Lord Leighton and stained-glass windows by Charles Kempe, William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and others; Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Alice in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, is buried there. Glasshayes House (the former Lyndhurst Park Hotel) is the only surviving example of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s architectural experimentation, and local folklore records Lyndhurst as the site of a Dragon-slaying, and as being haunted by the ghost of Richard Fitzgeorge de Stacpoole, 1st Duc de Stacpoole.

==History==
The name &quot;Lyndhurst&quot; is an Old English name, meaning &#x27;Wooded hill with lime-trees growing&#x27;. The name comprises the words &quot;lind&quot; (&#x27;lime-tree&#x27;) and &quot;hyrst&quot; (&#x27;wooded hill&#x27;). The first mention of Lyndhurst was in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name &#x27;Linhest&#x27;. It was part of the royal lands of the New Forest, with the exception of 1 virgate which was held by Herbert the Forester. Herbert may have been the ancestor of the Lyndhurst family, beginning with Herbert Lyndhurst, who held the bailiwick and manor of Lyndhurst in the 12th and 13th centuries.

The manor passed to Henry III in 1270, and together with the wardenship of the New Forest, which invariably accompanied the manor, it formed part of the dowry of four consecutive queens: Eleanor of Castile, Margaret of France, Isabella of France, and Philippa of Hainault. The manor was back in the hands of the king before 1362, and it was granted to various noble families over the course of the following century. Between 1467 and 1581 it was in the hands of the Earls of Arundel, after which it once again reverted to the Crown.

The estate was once again passed to various noble families until 1667, when Charles II granted it to Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton. He was followed successively by his son and grandson, but by the mid 18th century it was back in royal hands, being held successively by Prince William Henry (up to 1805) and Prince Frederick (until 1827). Subsequently, the manor was deemed &quot;not important to be kept&quot;, and the copyholds of the manor, which included estates in Minstead, Burley, Bartley and Poulner, either became enfranchised or passed to the Crown.

A royal park was attached to the manor of Lyndhurst from a very early date. It was unusual for being a King&#x27;s Park within a King&#x27;s Forest. In 1299 it covered an area of , the profits from the honey gathered there amounting to 2 shillings per annum. It was actively worked during the 14th and 15th centuries when payments were made for the fencing and repairing of the palings. The &quot;old Park&quot; of Lyndhurst is where the Lime Wood (formerly Parkhill) Hotel now stands, the new park being on the A337 Brockenhurst road.

==Geography==

Lyndhurst is in the New Forest National Park, in Hampshire, England. The village is the administrative capital of the New Forest, with the district council based in the village. The Court of Verderers sits in the King&#x27;s House in Lyndhurst. The local headquarters of the Forestry Commission, the body that handles the maintenance of the softwood plantations, forest roads and paths, and controlling the spread of invasive plants, such as rhododendrons and gorse is also based in the King&#x27;s House.

The church of St. Michael and All Angels is a major landmark, built of many different colours of brick, on one of the highest points in the village. Glasshayes House (also known as the Lyndhurst Park Hotel) is a Georgian &quot;Gothick&quot; villa, and after its 1912 alterations is the only surviving example of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s forays into architecture. In local tradition it is haunted by the ghost of Richard Fitzgeorge de Stacpoole, 1st Duc de Stacpoole. It sits adjacent to Bolton&#x27;s Bench, a picturesque hill to the east of the village which, according to local folklore, was originally the corpse of a dragon; Other local landmarks include a row of much photographed thatched cottages on the road to the neighbouring hamlet of Emery Down, and the New Forest Centre, which includes the New Forest Museum and New Forest Gallery.

Also situated towards the outskirts of the village is Foxlease, one of the training and activity centres of Girlguiding UK, which has been the scene of several internationally important Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting events. It was established in February 1922 following the marriage of president Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. The headquarters of the privately owned British chemicals company Ineos is located in the village.

The civil parish includes the hamlets of Bank and Emery Down. Lyndhurst is surrounded by varied &quot;forest&quot;, from the heathland of Parkhill to the bog of Matley, and the open forest with its ancient oak and beech to the enclosures of softwoods.

==The King&#x27;s House==
The most important building in Lyndhurst is the King&#x27;s House, which has also in the past been called the Queen&#x27;s House, for the name changes according to the gender of the monarch. It is the principal building owned by the Crown in the New Forest, and contains the Verderers&#x27; Hall, home of the ancient Verderers&#x27; Court. The King&#x27;s House is also the local headquarters of the Forestry Commission.

A manor house probably existed in Lyndhurst by the 13th century. In the reign of Edward I an order was given for &quot;twenty oaks to make laths for the use of the queen&#x27;s manor-house at Lyndhurst.&quot; This house was probably superseded by the hunting lodge built at Lyndhurst in the 14th century, which received frequent royal visits, and for which there are many records relating to the repair and enlargement. In 1388 a hall was built within the lodge, known later as the Verderers&#x27; Hall.

Rebuilding took place in the reign of Henry VIII, and especially in the 17th century, during the reigns of Charles I and Charles II, and the current structure largely dates from this time. The last monarch to stay here was George III who visited the New Forest in June 1789. Frances Burney, who was Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte, described the house as &quot;a straggling, inconvenient, old house, but delightfully situated, in a village—looking indeed at present like a populous town, from the amazing concourse of people that have crowded into it.&quot;

The building today is a rambling two-storey structure in brick. The prisoners&#x27; dock, tables and chairs of considerable age are preserved in the hall. Also to be found within is the so-called &quot;Stirrup of Rufus&quot;, which was used to measure dogs.

==Religious sites==
The village&#x27;s Anglican church, St Michael and All Angels, is on a mound overlooking the village. It was built between 1858 and 1870, and is the third such building on the site. The church was designed by William White. It is constructed with red brick with yellow trim. It has a tall (160 ft,(48.8m)) brick-banded spire at the north-west end which can be seen from the Isle of Wight. The interior has yellow, white and red exposed brickwork, and a nave roof decorated with life-size supporting angels. The church contains a fresco by Frederick Leighton showing the &quot;Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins&quot;, with biblical characters said to be modelled on local people. The church also contains stained glass windows designed by William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and Charles Kempe.

Alice Liddell, also known as Alice Hargreaves, the inspiration for Alice in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, lived in and around Lyndhurst after her marriage to Reginald Hargreaves, and is buried in the graveyard.

There is also a very fine, small Catholic Church of the Assumption and St Edward the Confessor, built by Sir Arthur Blomfield between 1894 and 1896 as a memorial to Marie-Louise Souberbielle. The village also has a Baptist church.

==Education and culture==
Saint Michael and All Angels Infant School is the main village school. Lyndhurst Pre-School is located next to the Infant School. New Forest Small School is an independent school for children aged 3 to 16.

In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Lyndhurst library.

==The Bisterne Dragon==

Lyndhurst is notable in English folklore for being the supposed location of a dragon-slaying. The local tradition is that a dragon had his den at Burley Beacon in Burley. There are several versions of the tale, one being that the creature &quot;flew&quot; every morning to Bisterne, where it would be supplied with milk. To kill the dragon, a valiant knight (usually named Berkeley) built a hide, and with two dogs lay in wait. The creature came as usual one morning for its milk, and when the hut door was opened the dogs attacked it, and while thus engaged the knight took the dragon by surprise, the dogs dying in the affray. The fight raged throughout the forest, with the dragon finally dying outside Lyndhurst, its corpse turning into a great hill (now known as Boltons Bench). Though the knight had defeated the dragon he had been mentally broken by the battle, and after thirty days and thirty nights he went back to Boltons Bench to die alone atop it, his body turning into the yew tree which can still be seen today.

==Transport links==
The village is the meeting point of the A35, which runs northeast to southwest between Southampton and Bournemouth, and the A337 which runs north to south between Cadnam on the M27, and Lymington, a ferry port for the Isle of Wight on the south coast. To deal with the large volume of traffic through the village, there is a one-way system. This in effect turns the major roads of the village into a roundabout.

It has long been mooted that the solution to Lyndhurst&#x27;s traffic problem is to build a bypass through the surrounding National Park forest land. In 1947 the Government&#x27;s Baker Report accepted that a bypass might be necessary, and provision was made in the New Forest Act 1949 to construct roads through the forest with the consent of the Verderers. Public inquiries were held in 1975 and 1983. On both occasions the various routes proposed by the county council were opposed by the Verderers as being detrimental to the environment. The Verderers stated that they would not oppose a less harmful route.

The last serious attempt at a Lyndhurst Bypass Bill was rejected in July 1988. In 2006 Lyndhurst Parish Council again called for a bypass, and proposed that the road followed the route suggested in 1983 but with a cut-and-cover tunnel.

Although Lyndhurst itself does not have a railway station, it is served by Ashurst New Forest railway station, three miles () away, which was for many years named Lyndhurst Road railway station. It is also only four miles () from Brockenhurst and under 4 miles from Beaulieu Road station – all these stations are on the South West Main Line to London and Weymouth, serving Bournemouth and Southampton. Bus services operated by Bluestar run frequently to Southampton and Lymington. There are also two daily National Express coach departures to London Victoria. The New Forest Tour, an open-top bus tour run in the summer, starts and finishes in Lyndhurst.

<text>Katrina Price (December 3, 1975 – January 18, 1999) was an American basketball player. A star guard in her college career at Stephen F. Austin State University, Price died by suicide after her rookie season in professional basketball.

== High school career ==
In 1994, Price was named Central Texas Player of the Year and co-Most Valuable Player for Central Texas Female Athlete of the Year. She was also a class salutatorian with a 4.25 GPA. In her senior year she led La Vega High School (Waco, Texas) to the 1994 state finals and a 32–4 record, and averaged 30.0 points, 13.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 5.0 steals per game. The previous year, she was named 1993 Volleyball MVP of District 17-3A, for her performance in that sport.

== College career ==
In her Division I NCAA career, Price was Stephen F. Austin State University&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 2,278 career points and the Southland Conference player of the year in 1997 and 1998. A 5&#x27;-10&quot; guard, she was a third-team AP All-American (first team Academica All American) selection her senior season (1997–1998), averaging 22.1 points and 5.3 rebounds a game. As of 2001 Price held the record for most three-point field goals in a single championship game, with seven, in a game against the University of Toledo in 1997.

Price excelled academically as well as athletically. In high school, she was second in her graduating class, and she made the Dean&#x27;s List every semester she was in college.

== USA Basketball ==
Price competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 1997 Jones Cup Team that won the silver medal in Taipei. Several of the games were close, with the USA team winning four games by six points or fewer, including an overtime game in the semifinal match against Japan. The gold medal game against South Korea was also close, but the USA fell 76–71 to claim the silver medal for the event. Price averaged 3.0 points per game.

== Professional career ==
Price was drafted seventh overall pick by the Long Beach Stingrays in the 1998 American Basketball League draft, but the team disbanded before she could play a game. She was assigned to the Philadelphia Rage roster in August. She was a reserve guard, playing in 12 of the Rage&#x27;s 14 games before the league shut down in late December.

<doc id="1163812" wikidata="Q7879983" url="?curid=1163812" title="Ulster Liberal Party">
<text>The Ulster Liberal Party was a liberal and non-sectarian political party in Northern Ireland linked to the British Liberal Party. The party was officially neutral on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. Members expressed different views on the issue but agreed that Northern Ireland could only join the Republic of Ireland if that was the wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.

==History==
Active before the First World War, the Ulster Liberal Association sought to avoid a position on the question of Home Rule (the restoration of an Irish parliament in Dublin) which had seen Liberal Unionists split and join Conservatives in the Irish Unionist Alliance. In 1908, the Association dismissed the former Independent Orangeman and Liberal candidate for Mid Armagh in the 1906 parliamentary election, R. Lindsay Crawford as editor of its paper, &quot;Ulster Guardian&quot;, because it could not allow its pages &quot;to be used directly or indirectly in support of devolution or Home Rule&quot;.

After the creation of Northern Ireland as a home-ruled division of the United Kingdom in 1921, the Association was restyled the Northern Ireland Liberal Association, and in May 1928 relaunched itself as the Ulster Liberal Party. It nominated candidates in the 1929 UK general election, including future Seanad Éireann member Denis Ireland and Unbought Tenants&#x27; Association MP George Henderson, before the party became inactive.

The party was re-founded by Albert McElroy in 1956, as (again) the Ulster Liberal Association. From 1961 to 1969, the party had one seat in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, when Sheelagh Murnaghan held one of the four seats allocated to Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast. It was represented on the committee of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967. As a party it sought to end sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland and Murnaghan tried on four occasions to pass a Bill of Rights in the Northern Ireland Parliament to address discrimination.

In 1969 Claude Wilton became a senator for the party in the Senate of Northern Ireland.

After 1970, it suffered the loss of many of its members to the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. Its last political contest was the 1985 local government election, after which its last remnants joined the Labour &#x27;87 group. The Liberal Democrats, successor to the British Liberal Party, later formed links with the Alliance Party. There is also a small local party of the Liberal Democrats in Northern Ireland, who do not contest elections.

==Leadership==
As of 1971, the party&#x27;s president was McElroy, while John Quinn was the chair, and Berkley Farr was the secretary. Cecil Bell replaced Farr as secretary, and James Murray took over in 1979. From 1978 until 1982, the chair was Mervyn Cowan, the secretary was James Murray, and the position of president had been abolished. Patricia Cowan was the treasurer throughout.

<text>The Marzabotto massacre (in Italian &quot;strage di Marzabotto&quot;, &quot;Marzabotto slaughter&quot;), or more correctly, the massacre of Monte Sole, was a World War II war crime consisting of the mass murder of at least 770 civilians by Nazi troops, which took place in the territory around the small village of Marzabotto, in the mountainous area south of Bologna. It was the largest massacre of civilians committed by the Waffen SS in western Europe during the war. It is also the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Italy.

==Massacre==
In reprisal for attacks on German soldiers by partisans and the Resistance between 29 September and 5 October 1944, SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Walter Reder led soldiers of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS to systematically kill hundreds of people in Marzabotto. They also killed numerous residents of the adjacent Grizzana Morandi and Monzuno communes, the area of the massif of Monte Sole (part of the Apennine range in the province of Bologna).

Historians have struggled to document the number of victims. Some sources report up to 1,830 victims; others estimate 955 people killed. The Peace School Foundation of Monte Sole reports 770 victims. This number is close to the official report by &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Reder, who reported the &quot;execution of 728 bandits&quot;. Among the victims, 155 were less than 10 years old, 95 were aged 10 to 16, 142 were over 60 years old, 454 were male and 316 were female. Five were priests.

Giovanni Fornasini, a parish priest and member of the Resistance, risked his life to protect the population from the Nazis during the massacres. While Fornasini saved the lives of many of his parishioners and managed to escape immediate death, he was later discovered by an SS officer while he was burying the bodies of those killed in the massacre, which was forbidden by the Nazis. The officer accused him of crimes committed in the Marzabotto area. When Fornasini confessed to having helped the villagers avoid execution, the officer shot and killed him.

==Justice==
* The British tried SS General Max Simon for his part in the massacre. He was sentenced to death, later changed to life in prison. Simon was released in 1954 and died in 1961.
* The Americans arrested SS Major Walter Reder, an Austrian national, in Salzburg, and handed him over to the British. Reder was extradited to Italy in May 1948 to stand trial for war crimes. In 1951 he was tried in an Italian military court in Bologna. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the military prison at Gaeta. He was released in 1985 and died six years later in 1991.
* In 1998, on the 54th anniversary of the massacre, the German President Johannes Rau made a formal apology to Italy and expressed his &quot;profound sorrow and shame&quot; to the families of the victims of Marzabotto.
* In January 2007, 10 of 17 suspected former SS members were found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; by an Italian military tribunal in the north Italian town of La Spezia. They were sentenced to life imprisonment for the massacre. The Italian media reported that the 10 were also ordered to pay roughly €100 million to the survivors and relatives of the victims. Seven suspects were acquitted.

==Victims==

* Giovanni Fornasini (1915–1944), priest, Gold Medal of Military Valour, Servo di Dio
* (1918–1944), priest

==In popular culture==
* The 1975 film &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, which deals with philosophical themes about fascism, consumerism and the abuse of power, features a scene where hostages in a fascist convoy drives through Marzabotto as one hostage tries to escape. The scene was not shot in the real Marzabotto location. 
* &quot;The Man Who Will Come&quot; (2009) tells the story of the local Italian people, partisans and the Marzabotto massacre. It has won numerous awards. It features Raffaele Zabban playing Don Giovanni Fornasini, and Germano Maccioni playing Don Ubaldo Marchioni.

<doc id="1163829" wikidata="Q28106657" url="?curid=1163829" title="Model sheet">
<text>In visual arts, a model sheet, also known as a character board, character sheet, character study or simply a study, is a document used to help standardize the appearance, poses, and gestures of a character in arts such as animation, comics, and video games.

Model sheets are required when multiple artists are involved in the production of an animated film, game, or comic to help maintain continuity in characters from scene to scene. In animation, one animator may only do one shot out of the several hundred that are required to complete an animated feature film. A character not drawn according to the production&#x27;s standardized model is referred to as off-model.

Model sheets are also used for references in 3D modeling to guide proper proportions of models.

==Purposes==
Model sheets have also been used in the past to maintain graphic continuity over the years for long lasting cartoon productions of short or short features such as the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; or &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series.

Model sheets are drawings of posed cartoon or comic strip characters that are created to provide a reference template for several artists who collaborate in the production of a lengthy or multiple-edition work of art such as a comic book, animated film or television series. Model sheets usually depict the character&#x27;s head and body as they appear at various angles (a process known as &quot;model rotation&quot;), includes sketches of the character&#x27;s hands and feet, and shows several basic facial expressions.

Model sheets ensure that, despite the efforts of several or many artists, their work exhibits unity, as if one artist created the drawings (that is, they are &quot;on model&quot;). They show the character&#x27;s structure, proportions, attire, and body language. Often, several sheets are required to depict a character&#x27;s subtler emotional and physical attitudes.

Depending on the whim of animation direction, deviations from the model may be permitted in the course of final animation; this &quot;tightness&quot; of model is a major distinguishing factor in overall animation style, as it constitutes a tradeoff between expressiveness and smoothness/consistency. As such, the usage of models varies widely between studios and projects.

Model sheets can also be used in the construction of costumes or sculpted figurines.

==Specific annotations==
Model sheets also provide notes that present specific information about how to develop particular features of the character, such as his or her head shape, hair length and style, size and position of the eyes and the mouth.

==Examples==
Some model sheets are specific to particular completed or ongoing projects, whereas others are more general and inclusive of a studio&#x27;s entire collection of characters. Animation studios besides Disney and fans also post model sheets on their Internet Web sites. Larry&#x27;s Toon Institute provides a generic model sheet for the purpose of introducing the concept of model sheets.

==Copyright and fair use==
Model sheets are not typically in the public domain, but are copyrighted material owned by the animation studio which created it.

Although model sheets originally are intended for artists who work for the studios that own the characters for which these templates are developed, other artists, such as those who create fan art, profit from them by adapting their characters to their own uses.

<doc id="1163830" wikidata="Q6707657" url="?curid=1163830" title="Lydia Millet">
<text>Lydia Millet (born December 5, 1968) is an American novelist. Her 2020 novel &quot;A Children&#x27;s Bible&quot; was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction and named one of the ten best books of the year by the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. She has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize. &quot;Salon&quot; wrote of Millet&#x27;s work, &quot;The writing is always flawlessly beautiful, reaching for an experience that precedes language itself.&quot;

== Biography ==
Millet was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she attended the University of Toronto Schools. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in interdisciplinary studies, with highest honors in creative writing, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a master&#x27;s degree from Duke University. Formerly married to Kieran Suckling, Millet lives in Tucson, Arizona with her two children. She holds a master&#x27;s in environmental policy from Duke University&#x27;s Nicholas School of the Environment and worked for Natural Resources Defense Council for two years before joining the Center for Biological Diversity in 1999 as a staff writer.

== Career ==
Millet is best known for her dark sense of humor, stylistic versatility, and political bent. Her first book, &quot;Omnivores&quot; (1996), is a subversion of the coming-of-age novel, in which a young girl in Southern California is tormented by her megalomaniac father and invalid mother and finally sold in marriage to a real estate agent. Her second, &quot;George Bush, Dark Prince of Love&quot; (2000), is a political comedy about a trailer-park woman obsessed with the 41st American president.

=== &quot;My Happy Life&quot; (2002) ===
Brief but weighty, her third book, &quot;My Happy Life&quot; (2002), is a poetic, language-oriented work about a lonely misfit trapped in an abandoned hospital, who writes the poignant story of her life on the walls. It is narrated by, as &quot;The Village Voice&quot; glowing deems her, &quot;an orphan cruelly mistreated by life who nevertheless regards her meager subsistence as a radiant gift.&quot; Despite the horrors that amount to her life, she still calls herself happy. Jennifer Reese of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; commented on Millet&#x27;s new approach to the treatment of the literary victim, saying &quot;Millet has created a truly wretched victim, but where is the outrage? She has coolly avoided injecting so much as a hint of it into this thin, sharp and frequently funny novel; one of the narrator&#x27;s salient characteristics is an inability to feel even the mildest indignation. The world she inhabits is a savage place, but everything about it interests her, and paying no attention to herself, she is able to see beauty and wonder everywhere.&quot;

=== &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Pretty&quot; (2005) ===
Millet&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Pretty&quot; (2005), is a picaresque tragicomedy about an alcoholic pornographer with delusions, based partly on Millet&#x27;s stint as a copy editor at Larry Flynt Publications. Sarah Weinman of the &quot;Washington Post Book World&quot; called it &quot;both prism and truth&quot; &quot;With a sharp eye for small details, a keen sense of the absurd and strong empathy for its creations,&quot; Millet creates a kaleidoscope of quirky characters. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; called her fifth novel, &quot;Oh Pure and Radiant Heart&quot; (2005), an &quot;extremely smart…resonant fantasy.&quot; It brings three of the physicists responsible for creating the atomic bomb to life in modern-day New Mexico, where they acquire a cult following and embark on a crusade for redemption.

=== &quot;How the Dead Dream&quot; (2008) ===
&quot;How the Dead Dream&quot; is &quot;a frightening and gorgeous view of human decline,&quot; according to Utne Reader. It features a young Los Angeles real estate developer consumed by power and political ambitions who, after his mother&#x27;s suicide attempt and two other deaths, begins to nurture a curious obsession with vanishing species. Then a series of calamities forces him from a tropical island, the site on
one of his developments, onto the mainland where he takes a Conrad-esque journey up a river into the remote jungle. &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; summarized this black comedy, noting &quot;American culture loves its stories of hubris, downfall and ruin as of late, but it takes a writer of Millet&#x27;s sensitivity to enjoy the way down this much.&quot;

=== &quot;Love in Infant Monkeys&quot; (2009) ===
&quot;Love in Infant Monkeys&quot; is a short story collection featuring vignettes about famous historical and pop culture icons and their encounters with other species.

=== &quot;Ghost Lights&quot; (2011) ===
Her 2011 novel, &quot;Ghost Lights&quot;, made best-of-the-year lists in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and received strong critical attention. The novel stars an Internal Revenue Service bureaucrat named Hal — a man baffled by his wife&#x27;s obsession with her missing employer. In a moment of drunken heroism, Hal embarks on a quest to find the man, embroiling himself in a surreal tropical adventure (and an unexpected affair with a beguiling German woman). &quot;Ghost Lights&quot; is beautifully written, engaging, and full of insight into the heartbreaking devotion of parenthood and the charismatic oddity of human behavior. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;[An] odd and wonderful novel&quot;, while the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; wrote, &quot;Millet is that rare writer of ideas who can turn a ruminative passage into something deeply personal. She can also be wickedly funny, most often at the expense of the unexamined life.&quot;

&quot;Ghost Lights&quot; was the second in an acclaimed cycle of novels that began with &quot;How the Dead Dream&quot; in 2008. The third, &quot;Magnificence&quot; (2012) completes the cycle.

=== &quot;Magnificence&quot; (2012) ===
&quot;Magnificence&quot; introduced Susan Lindley, a woman adrift after her husband&#x27;s death and the dissolution of her family. Embarking on a new phase in her life after inheriting her uncle&#x27;s sprawling mansion and its vast collection of taxidermy, Susan decides to restore the extensive collection of moth-eaten animal mounts, tending to &quot;the fur and feathers, the beaks, the bones and shimmering tails.&quot; Meanwhile, an equally derelict human menagerie – including an unfaithful husband and a chorus of eccentric old women – joins her in residence. In a setting both wondrous and absurd, Susan defends her legacy from freeloading relatives and explores the mansion&#x27;s unknown spaces. Jonathan Lethem, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called it &quot;elegant, darkly comic…with overtones variously of Muriel Spark, Edward Gorey and J. G. Ballard, full of contemporary wit and devilish fateful turns for her characters, and then also to knit together into a tapestry of vast implication and ethical urgency, something as large as any writer could attempt: a kind of allegorical elegy for life on a dying planet. Ours, that is.&quot; The book was nominated for a Los Angeles Times Book Prize.

=== &quot;Shimmers in the Night&quot; (2012) ===
The September 2012 release of &quot;Shimmers in the Night&quot; was the second in &quot;The Dissenters&quot;, an eco-fantasy series for young adults. Beginning with &quot;The Fires Beneath the Sea&quot;, the plot follows two young siblings as they search for their mother, a shapeshifting character who is fighting against forces who wants to make the planet over in their own image.

=== &quot;Pills and Starships&quot; (2014) ===
&quot;Pills and Starships&quot; is a young adult novel set in &quot;a dystopic future brought by global warming.&quot;

=== &quot;Mermaids in Paradise&quot; (2014) ===
&quot;Mermaids in Paradise&quot; tempers the sharp satire of Millet&#x27;s early career with the empathy and subtlety of her more recent novels and short stories. In a send-up of the American honeymoon, &quot;Mermaids in Paradise&quot; takes readers to the grounds of a Caribbean island resort, where newlyweds Deb and Chip — the opinionated, skeptical narrator and her cheerful jock husband — meet a marine biologist who says she&#x27;s sighted mermaids in a coral reef. Karen Russell wrote &quot;leave it to Lydia Millet to capsize her human characters in aquamarine waters and upstage their honeymoon with mermaids. I am awed to know there&#x27;s a mind like Millet&#x27;s out there – she&#x27;s a writer without limits, always surprising, always hilarious.&quot;

=== &quot;Sweet Lamb of Heaven&quot; (2016) ===
&quot;Sweet Lamb of Heaven&quot;, published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in May 2016, blends domestic thriller with psychological horror, following a young mother&#x27;s flight from her cold and unfaithful husband. As her husband&#x27;s pursuit escalates to criminal levels, she and her six-year-old daughter go into hiding in a run-down coastal motel where the other guests may have unimaginable secrets of their own. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has praised the novel as &quot;a real thriller...part of a higher stakes game being played by Millet, one that will ultimately, unabashedly touch on time, beauty, horror, God, demons and the very nature of being,&quot; while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the book &quot;exuberant and playful...featuring a rollicking kidnapping plot and deliciously well-drawn characters.&quot;

=== &quot;Fight No More&quot; (2018) ===
&quot;Fight No More: Stories&quot;, published in June 2018, was named a best book of the year by &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

=== &quot;A Children&#x27;s Bible&quot; (2020) ===
&quot;A Children&#x27;s Bible&quot;, published in May 2020, follows a group of twelve children on a forced vacation with their families at a sprawling lakeside mansion. When a destructive storm descends on the summer estate, the group&#x27;s ringleaders decide to run away, leading the younger ones on a dangerous foray into the apocalyptic chaos outside. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, critic Ron Charles called the novel, &quot;a blistering little classic.&quot;

=== &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (2022) ===
&quot;Dinosaurs: A Novel&quot;, published October 2022, follows a lonely, wealthy heir as he moves from New York City to Phoenix, Arizona after a bad breakup. There, he befriends his next-door neighbors, becoming a confidante to the parents and a friend and trusted babysitter for the two children. He spends his time volunteering at a local women&#x27;s shelter and wrestling with his breakup and the possibility of future romance in middle age, while also learning about birds that populate the area – which are the descendants of &quot;dinosaurs&quot; referenced by the title.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; named it one of the top ten books of fiction published in 2022.

== Awards and honors ==
In 2012, Millet received a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named &quot;A Children&#x27;s Bible&quot; one of the top ten best books of 2020.

In 2022, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; named &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; one of the top ten books of fiction published in 2022.

<doc id="1163831" wikidata="Q2997434" url="?curid=1163831" title="Corn Palace">
<text>The Corn Palace, commonly advertised as The World&#x27;s Only Corn Palace and the Mitchell Corn Palace, is a multi-purpose arena/facility located in Mitchell, South Dakota, United States. The Moorish Revival building is decorated with crop art; the murals and designs covering the building are made from corn and other grains, and a new design is constructed each year. The Corn Palace is a popular tourist destination, visited by up to 500,000 people each year.

The Corn Palace serves the community as a venue for concerts, sports events, exhibits and other community events. Each year, the Corn Palace is celebrated with a citywide festival, the Corn Palace Festival. Historically it was held at harvest time in September, but recently it has been held at the end of August. Other popular annual events include the Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo in July and the Corn Palace Polka Festival in September. It is also home to the Dakota Wesleyan University Tigers and the Mitchell High School Kernels basketball teams.

==History==
In the late 19th century, a number of cities on the Great Plains constructed &quot;crop palaces&quot; (also known as &quot;grain palaces&quot;) to promote themselves and their products. As the idea succeeded, it spread, including: a Corn Palace in Sioux City, Iowa, that was active from 1887–1891; a Corn Palace in Gregory, South Dakota; a Grain Palace in Plankinton, South Dakota; and a Bluegrass Palace in Creston, Iowa. From 1887 to 1930, at least thirty-four corn palaces were built across the Midwest United States; only the Mitchell Corn Palace has remained intact.

The original Mitchell Corn Palace (known as &quot;The Corn Belt Exposition&quot;) was built in 1892 to showcase the rich soil of South Dakota and encourage people to settle in the area. It was a wooden castle structure on Mitchell&#x27;s Main Street, constructed on land donated by Louis Beckwith, a member of the First Corn Palace Committee. In 1904–1905, the city of Mitchell mounted a challenge to the city of Pierre in an unsuccessful attempt to replace it as the state capital of South Dakota. As part of this effort, the Corn Palace was rebuilt in 1905. In 1921, the Corn Palace was rebuilt once again, with a design by the architectural firm Rapp and Rapp of Chicago. Russian-style onion domes and Moorish minarets were added in 1937, giving the Palace the distinctive appearance that it has today.

In 2004, national media attention was drawn to the Corn Palace, when it received Homeland Security funding. This drew criticism of the Department of Homeland Security and its grant program. In 2007, the Corn Palace subsequently received $25,000 in DHS funding for a camera system useful for purposes including Barack Obama&#x27;s visit in 2008, and as reported by the &quot;Mitchell Daily Republic&quot;, to protect a &quot;new Fiberglass statue of the Corn Palace mascot Cornelius&quot; in 2009. This statue sits across Main Street, west of the Corn Palace.

The Palace&#x27;s domes were renovated in 2015 after shaking in strong winds. The new turrets are made of architectural metals.

==Mural construction==

The exterior corn murals are replaced and redesigned each year with a new theme, with designs created by local artists. From 1948 to 1971, the South-Dakota born Native American artist Oscar Howe designed the panels. Calvin Schultz designed the murals from 1977 to 2002. From 2003 to 2017, the murals have been designed by Cherie Ramsdell. No new mural was created in 2006 due to an extreme drought. Beginning in 2018, designs have been created by Dakota Wesleyan University students. As of 2018, it costs an estimated $175,000 each time the Palace is redecorated.

Twelve naturally occurring shades of corn are grown by local farmers to create the artwork. Artists&#x27; drawings are transferred to black tar paper labeled with codes corresponding to colors, providing a &quot;corn-by-numbers&quot; pattern showing where each colored cob should be nailed. Corn cobs are split in two lengthwise and nailed to the exterior of the building, using approximately 1.5 million nails and 325,000 ears of corn.

<text>Periwinkle is a color in the blue and violet family. Its name is derived from the lesser periwinkle or myrtle herb (&quot;Vinca minor&quot;) which bears flowers of the same color.

The color periwinkle is also called [[Lavender (color)|lavender blue]] and [[light blue]] violet. The color periwinkle may be considered a pale tint of purple-blue in the Munsell color system, or a &quot;pastel purple-blue&quot;. The color can represent serenity, calmness, winter, and ice. It can also symbolize blossoming friendships, womanhood, sentimental memories, and everlasting love. 

The first recorded use of periwinkle as a color name in English was in 1922.

== In popular culture ==

* Periwinkle blue is the color for esophageal and stomach cancer awareness ribbons, and for anorexia nervosa and bulimia. It is also the color for pulmonary hypertension awareness ribbons.
* Periwinkle was added to the Crayola palette in 1949.
* In the late 1990s, the Anaheim Angels changed their uniform to include this color.

<doc id="1163841" wikidata="Q304506" url="?curid=1163841" title="Alfisol">
<text>Alfisols are a soil order in USDA soil taxonomy. Alfisols form in semi-arid to humid areas, typically under a hardwood forest cover. They have a clay-enriched subsoil and relatively high native fertility. &quot;Alf&quot; refers to aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe). Because of their productivity and abundance, Alfisols represent one of the more important soil orders for food and fiber production. They are widely used both in agriculture and forestry, and are generally easier to keep fertile than other humid-climate soils, though those in Australia and Africa are still very deficient in nitrogen and available phosphorus. Those in monsoonal tropical regions, however, have a tendency to acidify when heavily cultivated, especially when nitrogenous fertilizers are used.

In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), most Alfisols are classified as Luvisols or Lixisols, but some are classed as Retisols or Nitisols. Aqualfs are mainly Stagnosols or Planosols. Alfisols with a natric horizon are mainly Solonetz.

Alfisols occupy around one-tenth of the Earth&#x27;s ice-free land surface. They are dominant in many areas, such as the Ohio River basin in the United States, southern and unglaciated Western Europe, the Baltic region and central European Russia, the drier parts of Peninsular India, Sudan in Africa, and many parts of South America.

Alfisols have undergone only moderate leaching. By definition, they have at least 35% base saturation, meaning calcium, magnesium, and potassium are relatively abundant. This is in contrast to Ultisols, which are the more highly leached forest soils having less than 35% base saturation. In eastern North America, Alfisols are commonly found in glaciated areas while Ultisols are restricted to the areas south of the limit of maximum glaciation.

The fossil record of Alfisols begins in the Late Devonian. Probably owing to their fertility, they are the oldest forest soils; vegetation on weathered Oxisols, by contrast, is not known earlier than Middle Permian. Fossil Alfisols remain common from the Carboniferous and all periods since the Eocene.

==Suborders==
* Aqualfs – This suborder is saturated with water long enough to cause oxygen depletion. Almost all of this suborder is thought to have been forested at some point. Redoximorphic features are present. 
* Cryalfs – This suborder occurs mainly in high elevations which tend to be cold with temperatures ranging from greater than 0 C to less than 8 C.
* Udalfs – This suborder is located in humid or subhumid climates. All of this word is thought to have been forested at some point. 
* Ustalfs – This suborder is located in semiarid climates with wet summers and dry winters. 
* Xeralfs – This suborder is located in mediterranean climates with very dry summers and wet winters.

==Fossil record of Alfisols==

The fossil record of Alfisols extends back to the Late Devonian. The Alfisol paleosols were woodland soils and early forest soils. The fertile Alfisols were most likely formed by Devonian forests. The oldest of the Alfisol paleosol forest soils are in the paleosols of the Aztec Siltstone in Victoria Land, Antarctica. In the paleosols of the Aztec Siltstone, the Rosemary paleosol, there is evidence for trees from surficial tree-throwing structures and large drab-haloed root tracers. From the fossil wood and spores found in the Aztec Siltstone, there is a strong indication that the trees were Archaeopteris-Callixylon. 

In upper New York State, there have been Devonian trees found in a large variety of paleosols. These Devonian trees help give clues as to what ecological tolerances for various early trees looked like. The paleosols associated with progymnosperm trunks are interpreted to not have grown in soils similar to the type of soils modern seed plants are grown in. The taxa of progymnosperm trunk fossils reproduced by spores. For reproduction, they were more dependent on moisture than modern seed plants. Comparing the &quot;Wattieza&quot;, from New York Devonian paleosols, and the &quot;Callixylon&quot; ecotones to show this dependency on moisture it shows that the Wattieza lived in an ecotone of 571 ± 72 mm mean annual precipitation and the Callixylon lived in an ecotone of 611 ± 46 mean annual precipitation. Because the Callixylon grew taller than the &quot;Wattieza&quot; it is inferred it was because there was more mean annual moisture available to the &quot;Callixylon&quot;.

In the lower Walton Formation, near Sidney, New York fossils of &quot;Archaeopteris macilenta&quot;, &quot;Callixylon zalesskyi&quot;, and &quot;Geminospora lemurata&quot; have been found. The tapering geometry of large woody root traces is the most likely cause of the intimate relationship between Argillic horizons, Alfisols, and forests. The large woody root traces can transport water and clay using their large pipes. They are efficient at moving soil into a subsurface horizon when the plant dies and the roots decay. 

The Mata Amarilla Formation, a formation in the Austral Basin in southern Patagonia, Argentina is the location known for the preservation of podocarp-dominated fossil forests. In the eastern area of the middle section of the Mata Amarilla Formation, there are vertic Alfisols. In these Alfisols, there is a preservation of fossil forests, whose minimum age is 337 years. The fossil forests in this section are made up of &quot;in situ&quot; trunks. These trunks, in life position, have shallow root systems with well-developed horizontal roots, and have minimal development of vertical roots. A log of &quot;Podocarpxylon gargiae&quot; roots was found in the formation as well. The total mean diameter of these trees in the vertic Alfisol paleosol is greater than 60 cm and the smallest tree diameter is 26 cm.

While Afisol paleosols are known for their woodland soils and fossils, other types of fossils have also been found. The ichnofacies of the ground-nesting bees, &quot;Celliforma&quot;, was formed in well drained Alfisols as well as Aridisols and Oxisols. The &quot;Termitichnus&quot; ichnofacies, which included a large array of termite nests and pellets, is found in Oligocene Alfisols, Aridisols, and Oxisols. All the tetrapod bones and tracks from the paleosol sequences of Late Devonian and Mississippian of New York and Pennsylvania, U.S.A. are found in Aridisols and Alfisols. The Alfisols in the Texas High Plains have evidence for fossilized pollen and beetles.

<doc id="1163842" wikidata="Q1928400" url="?curid=1163842" title="Puerto del Carmen">
<text>Puerto del Carmen (Pto. del Carmen) is the main tourist town on the island of Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain. It is part of the municipality of Tías. Most of Lanzarote&#x27;s over 1 million visitors per year choose this town as their destination. As a result, almost all of the town&#x27;s economy revolves around tourism.

== History ==
The area of Puerto del Carmen was inhabited before the arrival of the Normans on the island and, at least since the 16th century, known as Tiñosa, so it appears on the maps of Torriani (as Tinosa), Brihuela/Cosala (as La Tiñosa), P.A. del Castillo (as La Tiñoça) and Riviere (as La Tinosa). This toponym is probably of Guanche origin, adapted to the phonetics of Spanish and related to other lexical variants such as Tiñor in El Hierro or Tiñoa in Tenerife.

After The Conquest it becomes a place of anchorage. In 1591 Leonardo Torriani, refers to the natural port of La Tiñosa. Later on, it became important with the barrel trade.

In 1900 it was declared a Port of General Interest, a distinction it lost in 1928 in favour of Arrecife. In 1904, La Tiñosa became a town with 194 inhabitants, mainly dedicated to fishing. In 1957, the small fishing village was renamed Puerto del Carmen, in honour of Nuestra Señora del Carmen.

The promenade known as &quot;Avenida de las Playas&quot; contains many restaurants, shops, bars and casinos.

From the coast it has been extending inland, up to a distance of approximately one kilometre.

==Tourism==

Since the opening of the Hotel los Fariones in 1967 it attracts tourists from all over Europe, particularly Ireland, the UK and Germany as well as from Scandinavia and Spain. The &quot;Avenida de las Playas&quot;, the main street/avenue in the town, extends some 7 km along the island&#x27;s southern coast, with beaches on one side and many restaurants, bars, shops and other tourist attractions on the other. Apartments, villas and hotels cover a kilometre or so inland from the coastline. The quaint and peaceful old town includes the harbour and docks, the Puerto Tinosa. Here there are a smaller variety of restaurants and bars with views across the harbour and the sea to the volcanic mountains of Papagayo beyond to views of another Canary Island: Fuerteventura.

==Scuba diving==
Puerto del Carmen is host to a large number of dive centres and scuba diving is one of the most popular sports there with very favourable conditions all year round. Water temperatures vary from 19 °C in the winter to 23 °C in the summer and visibility averages over 25 metres to 30 metres. Playa Chica is based in the old town of Puerto Del Carmen and is home to over 10 dive sites, with dives available from shore and boat.

==Shopping and dining==

Puerto Del Carmen hosts a variety of shops which sell mainly tourist-oriented products. The new town hosts bars, restaurants and tourist shops. The old town has many restaurants with outdoor terraces that overlook the marina below and the distant volcanic peaks. The Biosfera Plaza is a shopping plaza, opened in 2002, which includes many international brands and has entertainment facilities. There are a handful of clubs in the open until 6am which are often popular with many younger tourists.

<text>Jason Dolph Thompson (born July 6, 1954) is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers, California Angels, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Montreal Expos from 1976 to 1986. He was a three-time MLB All-Star.

==Detroit Tigers==
Thompson was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifteenth round of the 1972 Major League Baseball draft, but chose instead to play ball at Cal-State Northridge. He was then selected in the fourth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft by the Detroit Tigers.

In his first professional season, , he batted .324 with 10 home runs and 38 runs batted in for the Southern League&#x27;s Montgomery Rebels. With regular first baseman Dan Meyer batting .192 with only two RBIs, the Tigers gave the job to Thompson early into the season. He responded by going four-for-five in his third game as a major leaguer.

Despite batting just .218, Thompson led the Tigers with 17 home runs and was third on the club with 54 RBIs. He also earned a reputation as one of the top fielding first basemen in the American League. Following the season, he was named to the Topps Rookie All-Star team.

In , Thompson was batting .276 with 12 home runs and 65 RBIs at the All-Star break to gain selection to the AL squad, but he did not appear in the game. He was named to the All-Star team again a year later, and flew out to George Foster in his only at-bat.

In 1979, in a nationally televised NBC game on June 16, Thompson hit two home runs in the game, a 4–2 loss. Thompson initially hit a foul ball over the roof in foul territory in right field completely out of Tiger Stadium off California Angels&#x27; right-hander Dave Frost who later gave up both home runs. Thompson also hit several other home runs over the right field roof of Tiger stadium during his time in Detroit. In four plus seasons with the Tigers, Thompson batted .256 with 98 home runs and 354 RBIs.

==California Angels==
After getting off to a slow start in , Thompson was traded from the Tigers to the Angels for Al Cowens on May 27. The Angels had a shortage of power hitters due to injuries to Don Baylor and Brian Downing at the time. Thompson assumed first base duties upon his acquisition by the Angels with Hall of Famer Rod Carew shifting to designated hitter, however, they traded positions by the end of the season. Thompson batted over .300 for the Angels, but was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates during spring training the following season for Mickey Mahler and Ed Ott.

==Trade to the Yankees==
Immediately after acquiring Thompson, the Pirates dealt him to the New York Yankees for Jim Spencer and minor league pitchers Greg Cochran and Fred Tolliver, however, commissioner Bowie Kuhn voided the deal. The Yankees were to pay Spencer&#x27;s salary according to the original deal; which put the transaction over the $400,000 limit the commissioner had established for any transaction.

==Pittsburgh Pirates==
Now part of a team he was never intended to be part of, Thompson got off to a slow start with the Pirates, batting .171 with seven home runs and seventeen RBIs in the first half of the strike shortened season. His hitting improved substantially in the second half of the 1981 season, as he batted .321 with eight home runs and 25 RBIs.

Thompson continued his hot hitting into , hitting thirteen home runs and batting .354 through the month of May to earn the third All-Star nod of his career. For the season, Thompson batted .284 with 31 home runs and 101 RBIs. He became the third player in Pirates history to reach the 100-RBI, 100-walk plateau, finishing fifth in the National League in OPS with a .902 mark.

On June 26, , Thompson hit four home runs in a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, tying Ralph Kiner&#x27;s 37-year franchise record for most home runs in a doubleheader.

Thompson remained with the Pirates through , batting .259 with 93 home runs and 354 RBIs in his five seasons with the club. During Spring training , he was dealt to the Montreal Expos for two minor leaguers. He lost his starting job to rookie Andrés Galarraga shortly into the season, and was released on June 30. Thompson was unable to continue his career due to knee injuries.

==Career stats==

While with the Tigers, Thompson earned the nickname &quot;Roof Top&quot; from his ability to hit balls onto the Tiger Stadium right field roof. On two occasions he powered the ball over the roof and completely out of the stadium. A steady first baseman, he also led each league in total chances in 1977 and .

<doc id="1163847" wikidata="Q371714" url="?curid=1163847" title="The Kids from Room 402">
<text>The Kids from Room 402 is an animated series produced by CinéGroupe and Saban Entertainment that premiered on October 9, 1999 on the Fox Family Channel in the United States, and on August 29, 2000 on Teletoon in Canada. It consists of 52 half-hour episodes, the last of which aired in 2000, with reruns airing until 2005. The series was also seen in Latin America and Europe on Fox Kids, with the latter region still airing the series after the Fox Kids channels were purchased by Disney and changed their name to Jetix; remaining on their schedule until the Jetix channels were once again rebranded as Disney XD.

The series is focused primarily on a group of elementary school students. Miss Graves, their teacher, is usually shown as an interlocutor in the issues and injustices that are inflicted upon the students, whether the dilemmas be internal or external. Each episode usually ends with a substantiated moral or lesson resulting from such aforementioned situations.

The series is based on the 40-page children&#x27;s book &quot;Gracie Graves and the Kids from Room 402&quot; by Betty Paraskevas and Michael Paraskevas, published in 1995. This was retitled in 2000 as simply &quot;The Kids from Room 402&quot; to match the series.

The animated series was story edited and developed for television by Lesa Kite and Cindy Begel, who wrote all 52 episodes.

==Characters==
===Kids from Room 402===
*Nancy Francis (voiced by Mindy Cohn) - Nancy is a redheaded girl with horn-rimmed glasses. Nancy has snobbish tendencies. She spends a lot of time trying to make herself popular. She is a good learner and a straight-A student. She always tries to fit in. She helps Jesse out a lot because he is picked on. Albeit good-natured, she is sometimes bossy. She is always trying to befriend Penny, but she is unsuccessful at that. Sometimes she ended up being &quot;friends&quot; with Polly McShane who she mostly dislikes. She and Jesse serve as the co-protagonists.
*Jesse McCoy (voiced by Spencer Klein/Shawn Pyfrom) - Jesse is the dumbest kid in the school, and he is often verbally picked on by his friends, including Vinnie, because his mother treats him like a baby. Whenever he has a hard task or homework to do, he usually gets out of it by telling a lie to Miss Graves or sometimes his mother, but both of them catch on and give him several punishments. Jesse is bald and wears an orange sweater with blue jeans.
*Vincent &quot;Vinnie&quot; Nasta (voiced by Andrew Lawrence/Pamela Adlon) - Vinnie is the prankster of the class. He is a tall Italian-American boy who likes to pull pranks on people. Even Miss Graves. Based on that, he tends to be a thorn in her side, to the point where she so often threatens to call his mother on him whenever he tries them on her. Vinnie wears a football jersey and has spiky brown hair. He is also friends with Jesse, and the two pull pranks together on some reason, although sometimes he picks on Jesse mainly due to how his mother treats him. Vinnie has an older brother named Tony, whose past school projects Vinnie often tries to pass as his own but Miss Graves always remembers having already evaluated them during Tony&#x27;s time. Vinnie once lost his friends when they learned his aunt married Mr. Besser but fortunately the wedding was short-lived.
*Polly McShane (voiced by Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey) - Polly, a proud Lithuanian-American, is considered a &quot;teacher&#x27;s pet&quot; in both demeanor and appearance. Polly is extremely intelligent (she is highly gifted and earned a score of 152 SD 15 - 99.97365 percentile - on the IQ test as was revealed in the episode HIQ) and has glasses, brown hair and a red and blue-striped dress. The other children, including the staff, can usually detect her presence due to her constant yodeling and obnoxious and intense disposition, especially on a count of her loud voice. She has an obsession with spoons. She is also well known for wanting to be the life of the party and be on top of everything, and for being a gossip and tattletale to the heads of the class over other children she catches behaving badly. For all of these reasons, she is a major thorn in the flesh of everyone, especially Nancy and Miss Graves. She has a pet goat named Schnitzy.
*Penny Grant (voiced by Tara Strong) - Penny is Danish-American and one of the wealthiest girls in the entire school, as well as a very charitable and kind person. Penny is not a snob despite the common stereotype following rich kids in modern-day animation. She has blonde hair and blue eyes that helps her fit in very nicely. She is faithful and voluntarily participate to social programs in order to help other people. Also she is intelligent, hard working and a bright student, often earning the best results on the class. Nancy and the other girls from the class try to befriend her because of how wealthy and kind she is, but sometimes Penny doesn&#x27;t even realize that she is rich, and that Nancy and the other girls are always trying to befriend her (although she doesn&#x27;t despise them).
*Arthur Kenneth Van Der Wall (voiced by Christopher Marquette) - An upper-class Dutch-American boy who is usually attempting to sell abnormally extravagant goods to the other children in the class. He has auburn hair and wears a blue suit. He is smart, clever and practical but also has a very shy personality. He often tries to profit from others, but usually his plans fail.
*Freddie Fay (voiced by Bryton McClure) - Freddie is basically classified as a nerd boy in the school and he often bemoans that fact. He has glasses, black hair, wears a yellow shirt and sticks out as an easily found school nerd. He works very hard to have good results and is an A− student. Being silly is frequently mocked by the others, especially Vinnie and Jesse, or fooled by Arthur who sometimes uses him in his plans. E.g. in one episode everyone picked on him because they thought he had wet his pants, when actually the water fountain sprayed him by accident.
*Charlie (voiced by Crystal Scales) - An African-American boy who looks slightly similar to Sanjay, with dark hair and a red shirt. He often wins what Nancy should have won. In one episode, the class switched seats to fool Mr. Besser when he became a substitute teacher, and when Nancy&#x27;s report was worth an A, Mr. Besser mistook her for Charlie due to the seating arrangement plans (since he knew few of the students&#x27; names except for Jesse and Vinnie, whom he often put in detention). And when Jesse got glasses that he couldn&#x27;t see with, he was the swing vote between Nancy and Charlie, and, while intending to vote for Nancy, voted for Charlie by mistake because he couldn&#x27;t see the names clearly.
*Jordan (voiced by Tara Strong) - A Chinese-American girl who is very rich, but keeps that in a secret. Nancy finds out in one episode, promising Jordan to keep the secret out of fear her friends will think she&#x27;s a snob. To keep them from knowing, she did not invite anyone to her house, which caused some people to think she&#x27;s poor. However, when Nancy bragged so much about having a wealthy friend (without telling anyone she was referring to Jordan) her other friends started avoiding her like Jordan feared would happen to her if they knew she was wealthy.
*Gabrielle (voiced by Olivia Hack) - A girl who is usually seen with Jordan and Nancy. She mostly goes along with everything Jordan thinks or does, and although she is Nancy&#x27;s friend, sometimes argues with her.
*Mary-Ellen (voiced by Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey) - A girl who is one of Nancy&#x27;s friends. Doesn&#x27;t have much participation in the series.
*Tillie (voiced by Tifanie Christun) - Another of Nancy&#x27;s friends, a tall girl with brown hair who is somewhat self-absorbed.
*Jenny - A girl with red glasses who doesn&#x27;t have much participation in the class.
*Joey Tuna - A tall boy who is often seen sitting next to Jesse in the series. Another character that doesn&#x27;t have much participation in the series.
*Don - A Chinese-American tall boy, and doesn&#x27;t interact much with the others.
*Piggy McCall (voiced by Justin Jon Ross) - A slightly fat boy with glasses who is also a minor character, 
*Melanie Bellanchof (voiced by Debi Derryberry) - A new student to the school, she is Mrs. Bellanchof&#x27;s daughter, her parents are either divorced or split up, as Melanie comes to town to live with her mother. She doesn&#x27;t like living with her, and when referring to anything that she doesn&#x27;t like will say either &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t care&quot; or &quot;Smells&quot;. At her house, she is mostly seen on the phone talking to a friend from her old school named Gloria.

===Other kids===
*Sanjay (voiced by Tara Strong) - An Indian-American student with dark brown hair, a maroon shirt, and speaks with an accent, who looks slightly similar to Charlie. He is often irritated by Polly.
*Zack (voiced by Sam Saletta) - The bully of the school and a recurring antagonist.

===Adults===
*Miss Gracie Graves (voiced by April Winchell) - Miss Gracie Graves is a really good teacher. She acts as the voice of reason, which is why most of her students go to her whenever they seek help or advice.
*Mr. Stuart Besser (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) - Mr. Stuart Besser is the incompetent principal of the school. Noted for his stupidity and overweight stature, he is often satirized, whether it be vocal or written, by his students. His negligence and ignorance serves as recurring comic relief within the television show. Mr. Besser was once married to Vinnie&#x27;s aunt, much to the shock of both males (Vinnie didn&#x27;t know Mr. Besser was his aunt&#x27;s husband and Mr. Besser didn&#x27;t know Vinnie is his wife&#x27;s nephew until the two of them met during the wedding party) but the wedding ended when she learned he expected to live at her expenses. Mr. Besser was oblivious to the fact Vinnie didn&#x27;t like being his nephew.
*Nurse Pitts (voiced by Lori Alan) - The school nurse. She&#x27;s obsessed with illness and also talks a lot about death. The kids, as well as the teachers, are scared of her.
*Coach (voiced by Cam Clarke) - The school gym teacher.
*Roberta McCoy (voiced by Edie McClurg) - Jesse&#x27;s overprotective mother. She usually treats Jesse like a baby and embarrasses him near his friends who sometimes mock him.
*Mrs. Amy Bellanchof - Melanie&#x27;s mother who is a teacher attending Melanie&#x27;s new school. However, as she didn&#x27;t have a lesson plan, her students made a bit progress, which put her on the verge of getting fired. Although Miss Graves helped her improve her class by sharing her lesson plan, Mrs. Bellanchof dishonestly passed Miss Graves&#x27; plan as her own to win an award. In other acts that show her lack of honesty, she got custody of her daughter by lying to the judge about which parent Melanie would rather live with, and used her position at the school to have her daughter join the cheerleading squad despite Melanie trying to tell her she doesn&#x27;t want to be a cheerleader. She also loses her temper easily, especially when Melanie complains and tells her she wants to go back to live with her father, pulling her hair and screaming when she is overly angry or stressed.
*Mrs. Francis (voiced by April Winchell) - Nancy&#x27;s mother.

===Cameo adults===
*Mrs. Myerson (voiced by April Winchell) - She is a stout woman with a very pleasant and respectable disposition. She wears a pink dress and has blonde hair. She lives in a neighborhood around the school. She briefly appears a few times in the episode &quot;Bing, Bing, Bing, and a Shot&quot;.
*Mr. Miller (voiced by Mel Brooks) - He is the pool official of a pool in Miami that Nancy goes to visit. He gives her a hard time about things like hygiene. He appears in the episode &quot;Squeezed Out&quot;.

<text>Butterflying is a way of preparing meat, fish, or poultry for cooking by cutting it almost in two, but leaving the two parts connected; it is then often boned and flattened. Spatchcocking is a specific method for butterflying poultry that involves removing the backbone, and spatchcock as a noun may refer to a bird prepared in that way.

==Etymology==
&quot;Butterfly&quot; comes from the resemblance of the cut to the wings of a butterfly.

==Red meat==
In butchery, butterflying transforms a thick, compact piece of meat into a thinner, larger one. The meat is laid out on a cutting board and cut in half parallel to the board almost all the way to the other side, leaving a small &quot;hinge&quot;, which is used to fold the meat out like a book. This technique is often used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, pounding out the meat with a meat mallet to make it thinner.

For leg of lamb, it is generally followed by boning.

Common uses of this technique include creating thin cutlets from chicken breasts for dishes such as chicken piccata, or rendering lamb leg roasts suitable for making roulades. It can also be a first step to dicing chicken or slicing it into strips. Because the butterflying technique results in a thinner piece of meat or poultry, it allows for quicker cooking times and often more even cooking.

==Poultry and &quot;spatchcocking&quot;==
Poultry is often butterflied. Butterflying makes poultry easier to grill or pan-broil.

The more specific term &quot;spatchcocking&quot; refers to a variation on butterflying that also removes the backbone and possibly the sternum, typically from a smaller bird. Removing the sternum allows the bird to be flattened more fully. This is popular for grilling, roasting, or cooking sous-vide. 

According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot; by Alan Davidson, the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; could be found in cookbooks as far back as the 18th and 19th centuries. It was thought to be of Irish origin, possibly short for &quot;dispatch cock,&quot; which referred to &quot;grilling a bird after splitting it open down the back and spreading the two halves out flat.&quot; It may also derive from &quot;spitchcock,&quot; a method of grilling eels.

&quot;Spatchcock&quot; may also be used as a noun to refer to a small bird that has been prepared by spatchcocking.

==Fish==
A butterfly fillet of fish is a double fillet, with the backbone and other bones removed by splitting the fish down the back or the belly.

==Other==
Butterflying shrimp or lobster tail involves cutting the hard top side, without cutting all the way down to the other, softer side.
