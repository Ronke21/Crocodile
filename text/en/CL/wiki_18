<text>Unleashed in the East is the first live album by the English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released in September 1979 on Columbia Records. It was recorded live over two nights in Tokyo during their Hell Bent for Leather Tour in February 1979. Upon release &quot;Unleashed&quot; became the band&#x27;s best-selling album up to that point, reaching the US Top 100 and the UK Top Ten, eventually the album became one of the five Judas Priest albums to gain a RIAA platinum certification. It is the first Priest album to be produced by Tom Allom who would remain at the helm for the next decade for the band, and the last release to feature drummer Les Binks.

To what extent the album was really live remains a matter of contention, with the album sometimes being called &quot;Unleashed in the Studio&quot;. Years later, after he had left Priest, Rob Halford noted in various interviews that the music was indeed live, but that his vocals had been ruined in the original recording and were later dubbed in a concert-like studio setting.

==Reissues==
The 2001 CD reissue featured four &quot;bonus tracks&quot;, &quot;Rock Forever,&quot; &quot;Delivering the Goods,&quot; &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; and &quot;Starbreaker&quot;, which had been issued on the 7-inch bonus disc that came with the original 1979 Japanese vinyl release. Three of these were from their then-current album &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;), which was not well represented on the original release. &quot;Delivering the Goods&quot; and &quot;Starbreaker&quot; had been exclusive to the Japanese release, although the former would be one of the B-side tracks to the &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; 12-inch, released in March 1980.

These four tracks were previously available on the Japanese pressing of the album (titled &quot;Priest in the East&quot; and having the same track-list as the remaster), and were recorded at the same time as the original nine tracks. Additionally, two more songs were recorded from the same concerts but were only available as B-sides on various singles:

&quot;Evil Fantasies&quot; was on the &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; 12-inch, along with &quot;Delivering the Goods.&quot; This live version of &quot;Evil Fantasies&quot; had an official CD release on &quot;Single Cuts&quot; (2011), albeit with a 6-second edit to the start, which trims Halford&#x27;s chat slightly.
&quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; was pressed with &quot;Rock Forever&quot; and &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; on a special 3 track live EP that came with initial UK pressings of &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot;. There is also a 1979 UK cassette version with 12 songs: &quot;Rock Forever&quot;, &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; in addition to the original 9 tracks. To date, this version of &#x27;Beyond the Realms of Death&#x27; has not been released on CD.

All the extra songs are fully produced, and are of the same quality as the original nine tracks. Certain bootlegs have turned up with all fifteen tracks in the original setlist order, to better reflect the actual concerts of the 1979 tour. (For the record, all the &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot; recordings were taken from shows on 10 February 1979 at Kosei Nenkin Kaikan Tokyo, and 15 February 1979 at Nakano Sunplaza Tokyo. Additionally, there were two shows on 10 February: an afternoon and an evening show. The two 10 February shows can be found as a bootleg under the title &quot;Tyranny Unleashed in the East.&quot;) Two more songs, &quot;White Heat, Red Hot&quot; and &quot;Take on the World&quot; were performed but never officially recorded.

However, the &quot;Take on the World&quot; 12-inch single, released in late 1978, included a live version of &quot;White Heat, Red Hot&quot; recorded at The Agora in Cleveland, Ohio on 9 May 1978 (on the &quot;Stained Class&quot; Tour). Live versions of &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot; and &quot;Starbreaker&quot; recorded from the same 1978 Cleveland show were released as b-sides to the &quot;Evening Star&quot; 7-inch single and &quot;Take on the World&quot; 12-inch single, respectively. These tracks are available on the &quot;Priest, Live and Rare&quot; CD. They are &quot;not&quot; the same versions as on &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot;. The band was possibly trying to avoid repetition by not including songs on the official full-length live album that were already available as live versions on singles.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that &quot;this absurd piece of bombast was recorded live in Japan and you can pick up every nuance of 120-decibel rock bounding off the audiences&#x27; skulls.&quot;

<doc id="1159328" wikidata="Q2916664" url="?curid=1159328" title="Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin">
<text>Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin in Florida (also known as Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in California, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast in Paris and Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue in Shanghai) is an interactive shooting dark ride attraction located in the Tomorrowland area of the Disney theme parks. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, this attraction combines a carnival game and a third-generation Omnimover system. It is inspired by Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, and contains several elements loosely based on the cartoon series &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;.

The attraction first opened at Magic Kingdom on November 3, 1998. Subsequent versions can be found at Disneyland, Disneyland Park in Paris, and Shanghai Disneyland. Although each ride may have a different name, all share the same major plot and characters. The ride formerly existed at Hong Kong Disneyland under the name &quot;Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters&quot;, but was closed in September 2017, and Tokyo Disneyland &quot;Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Astro Blasters&quot;, but was closed in October 31, 2024. For a brief period from the Shanghai version&#x27;s opening in 2016 until the Hong Kong version&#x27;s closure in 2017, and Japan version&#x27;s closure in 2024, the attraction was only one of two that could be found at all six Disney castle parks worldwide (the other attraction being Dumbo the Flying Elephant).

==Plot==
The backstory of the ride revolves around the attempts of Evil Emperor Zurg (voiced by Ken Mitchroney in Space Ranger Spin, Tesshō Genda in Astro Blasters at Tokyo Disneyland, Andrew Stanton at Astro Blasters in Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland and Laurent Gamelon in Astro Blasters in Disneyland Paris, and an unknown actor in Planet Rescue) to steal the batteries (known as &quot;crystallic fusion cells&quot;) used to power the space vehicles of the &quot;Little Green Men&quot; (voiced by Jeff Pidgeon). Participants are &quot;Star Command&quot; raw recruits sent to defeat Zurg. The queue area is awash in the chartreuse, white, and bright blue hues of Buzz Lightyear himself (voiced by Pat Fraley, who does voice for all Buzz Lightyear attractions [minus the Shanghai and Japanese rides]). Since Buzz Lightyear is a toy, the attraction is cleverly scaled to give the illusion that one has just been reduced to the size of an action figure, featuring such detail as giant, exposed Philips screw heads and an explanation of the interactive phase of the ride that resembles a toy&#x27;s instruction sheet, only on a gigantic scale. An Audio-Animatronic Buzz Lightyear figure and giant Etch-a-Sketch (Disneyland) and/or View-Master (Walt Disney World) provide explanation of the &quot;mission&quot; to destroy Zurg&#x27;s secret weapon with your blasters. While his body is audio-animatronic, Buzz&#x27;s face is actually a screen with a projection of computer animation, allowing better lipsync and more expressive features, making him look like a more realistic representation of the character from the films.

==Technical aspects==
&quot;Astro Blasters&quot; and &quot;Space Ranger Spin&quot; are equal parts shooting gallery and dark ride. Visitors board an Omnimover space vehicle featuring two laser pistols and a joystick. The pistols are used to shoot laser beams at targets of varying point values. Targets that are hit while lit up will produce much higher scores. A digital readout on the dashboard shows the player&#x27;s score. The joystick allows full 360-degree rotation of the vehicle to assist in aiming. During the ride, if the ride slows down or completely stops (this is a result of either a disabled guest or a ride breakdown), this allows for &quot;bonus points&quot; as the pistols and targets do not turn off. There are 4 different shaped targets which are worth different numbers of points: round (100 points), square (1,000 points), diamond (5,000 points), and triangle (10,000 points).

At the conclusion of the ride, the digital score flashes L1-L7 displaying the ranking or level achieved for the below scores:

* Level 1 Star Cadet: 0 – 1,000
* Level 2 Space Scout: 1,001 – 10,000
* Level 3 Ranger 1st Class: 10,001 – 100,000
* Level 4 Planetary Pilot: 100,001 – 300,000
* Level 5 Space Ace: 300,001 – 600,000
* Level 6 Cosmic Commando: 600,001 – 999,998
* Level 7 Galactic Hero: 999,999+

Some of the rides feature an on-ride photo, which depending on the park may be available as a free electronic postcard via e-mail at the exit, or be available for purchase on the Disney&#x27;s PhotoPass system. The photos include the player&#x27;s score. If the score is in the top 100 highest of the day, the player&#x27;s ranking may be included in the photo. The Top 10 players&#x27; scores are shown on the scoreboard at the exit queue. The top person gets their face posted on the screen. The Disneyland version once featured at-home play tied directly to the attraction itself via the Internet, however this is disabled.

The installation at the Magic Kingdom utilizes an existing ride system by Arrow Development, originally constructed in 1972 for If You Had Wings. The ride was designed and manufactured by Sansei Technologies, Inc. with the corporation of Walt Disney Imagineering.

==History==
===Magic Kingdom===
The layout and systems of the ride date back to 1972. This space was originally home to If You Had Wings, an aviation themed ride sponsored by Eastern Airlines. Eastern Airlines dropped sponsorship of the ride for financial reasons in early June 1987. All Eastern themes were removed, and the ride was renamed If You Could Fly. If You Could Fly was closed down in January 1989.

The installation of Space Ranger Spin also impacted the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover, which runs through the south show building. The Tomorrowland Transit Authority, or TTA as it is often called for short, had opened in 1975 as the WEDway PeopleMover. At that time, If You Had Wings was the attraction occupying the south show building. Three diorama windows were also positioned on the track: two on the right and one on the left. These allowed the Mexico, Jamaica, and Trinidad scenes to be visible to riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority in such a way as to hide all projectors, lights and other show support equipment.

The diorama windows were altered once more when If You Had Wings was transformed into Delta Dreamflight. This was done because the windows no longer correctly lined up with show scenes. The first window was replaced with backlit panels depicting the ride&#x27;s barnstormer scene. Window two looked into the Parisian Excursion scene, from a viewpoint which heavily distorted the tableau&#x27;s forced perspective. The third window would have had TTA riders looking directly into an extremely bright light and so was completely obscured with plywood and black fabric.

In October 1997, Disney announced that Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin would be added to Magic Kingdom. When Delta Dreamflight transitioned yet again into the current attraction in 1998, the first window was refitted with the diorama of the hair salon, and the second left open to look into the new attraction, though concern was expressed over the fact that this view allows TTA riders to look directly into banks of high-powered blacklights. At one point during Space Ranger Spin, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the TTA passing through the building. The ride was briefly sponsored by Mattel from opening day to 1999.

Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin was named the 2004 Disney Magazine Reader&#x27;s Choice Award winner for Best Magic Kingdom Park Attraction for Young Kids.

===Disneyland===
Like the Magic Kingdom version at Walt Disney World, it uses infrastructure from previous attractions. Its show building originally housed the Circle-Vision 360° theater. In 1997, as part of a major makeover of Tomorrowland, the Circle-Vision theater was removed and the space became part of the queue for the now infamous Rocket Rods. The Rocket Rods, which were prone to breakdowns, ran from 1998 to 2000. This space was then unused until 2005, when Astro Blasters opened.

==Queue==
===Magic Kingdom===
The queue of the ride shows different pictures of Buzz Lightyear and the Little Green Men. It also shows the battery cells and pipes plugging into Star Command. The rookie Space Rangers then pass Buzz himself, briefing the new recruits on their mission to battle Zurg, as a large wanted poster that declares Zurg public enemy number one is stationed next to the viewmaster. Rookies are directed to leave the briefing room, and report to the flight deck, allowing them to board XP 37 Star Cruiser. Attached to them are ion laser cannons and a joystick to spin the cart, and in the flight deck is a mural featuring Buzz and the Green Squadron battling Zurg&#x27;s forces (which has since been updated to resemble the ones found at Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris).

===Tokyo Disneyland/Disneyland/Hong Kong Disneyland/Disneyland Paris===
This ride&#x27;s queue (as well as the other clones with these blueprints) includes a walkie talkie with Buzz Lightyear on it reading his wrist communication device. The speakers provide the following backstory to the ride: Zurg is attacking Green Planet, home of the Little Green Men, as well as several Space Rangers being attacked and possibly neutralized by Zurg himself and the Giant Robot army in Sector 9. Zurg himself patches in a call declaring his plan, claiming that not even Buzz Lightyear can stop him now. The queue, as well as featuring posters from the Florida attraction, also features a poster depicting Buzz Lightyear shooting a purple, green and orange colored alien, and one depicting Lightyear leading a team of Space Rangers, which includes a character that strikingly resembles Princess Mira Nova from the film and the TV show Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. The rookies enter the briefing room to see Buzz himself, who (much like the Florida attraction) debriefs guests about the mission. The only difference between the two debriefs is that the future versions of the attraction included a line about Zurg&#x27;s reason for his use of the batteries, which is followed by Buzz firing an Astro Blaster at the Etch a Sketch, which will feature a drawing of Zurg, before disintegrating into nothing. The rookies proceed down a long Corridor seeing the LGMs testing the Blasters, maps of the Galactic Alliance, or the targets. The rookies then board their star cruisers on the flight deck, equipped with Astro Blasters, and (in the case of the California, Hong Kong, and Paris versions of the ride), surrounded by a mural of Buzz, alongside some LGMs, battling Zurg&#x27;s robot army. Each of the queues are different in each iteration, but all are similar in design and concept.

===Shanghai Disneyland===
This queue takes on a more futuristic and grounded approach to fit within the more futuristic Tomorrowland as opposed to the more cartoony and colorful variations found elsewhere. The backstory is also slightly changed, with Zurg being based on his homeworld of Xrgthung, the same planet from the opening Toy Story 2. Zurg plans to utilize a massive laser cannon to destroy the homeworld of the Little Green Men. Buzz Lightyear himself has traveled to the planet in an attempt to stop him, and asks the rookie Space Rangers for help, allowing them to be jetosenned on Star Cruisers equipped with two laser blasters.

==Attraction==
===Magic Kingdom===
The Magic Kingdom&#x27;s version of the ride, known as Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, is the first Buzz Lightyear attraction, and the third Omnimover ride to operate in Tomorrowland&#x27;s south show building. Unlike other versions of the attraction, Magic Kingdom&#x27;s version features laser guns that are stationary.

The ride begins when the cart enters the &quot;Astro-Accelerator.&quot; The ride then enters a robot attack scene. An orange robot called the Box-O-Bot (originally labeled as a Rock &#x27;Em Sock &#x27;Em Robot during the Mattel sponsorship), a blue and purple robot called the Gigantobot, a green robot called the Battery Bot, and a Dog Bot are all present in this scene. The ride then slopes down a short hill into Planet Z. Here guests encounter many aliens including space chickens, space spiders, and others. There is also a volcano that is shooting green goo. The guests then enter Zurg&#x27;s fortress where they see a battery delivery and Zurg commanding his guards to seize the guests and &quot;their little green friends, too.&quot; Zurg is in his spaceship, which he calls his Spiderbot. In the next room the aliens show the guests that Zurg has escaped. The next room is the projection tunnel and in it Zurg is shooting at the guests, telling them to &quot;PREPARE FOR TOTAL DESTRUCTION&quot; and that they&#x27;ll never catch him. The final room shows Buzz Lightyear fighting with Zurg in the now destroyed Spiderbot. The Little Green Men help Buzz tear it apart. Then the unload area shows Buzz Lightyear thanking the guests while holding Zurg in the claw. Zurg then threatens us that he&#x27;ll be back. Guests will then exit the ride into Buzz&#x27;s Star Command where they can purchase a photo of themselves on the ride.

Mattel, having just transferred its sponsorship from the It&#x27;s a Small World attraction thus in turn making that attraction sponsorless in nearby Fantasyland originally sponsored the Walt Disney World attraction from its opening to 1999 when all references to Mattel were removed from the attraction. The Disney World version has been without sponsorship ever since.

===Disneyland===

Disneyland&#x27;s version of the ride is called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters.

A key difference between this ride and its counterpart at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom is that its laser guns can be removed from their mounts to allow for more accurate shooting (similar to Men in Black: Alien Attack). The laser guns at Space Ranger Spin at Magic Kingdom cannot be removed from their mounts and have limited movement.

The ride begins as the rookies are jetosenned out into space and encountering Zurg&#x27;s robot army. Despite repainting and repositioning, the army still consists of the Box-O-Bot, the Gigantobot, the Dogbot, and the Batterybot. The Guests enter Zurg&#x27;s Dreadnought down a hallway shooting batteries until you reach his laboratory. Zurg himself is seen firing his ion blaster, infuriated of the guests&#x27; presence, their aim, their devotion to Star Command, and being knocked out of orbit. As the rookies leave the Dreadnought, a few robots attempt to land it safely, only to be electrocuted by the rookies and the failing equipment of the Dreadnought. The rookies enter Planet Z (In the French Version of the ride Buzz Lightyear says &quot;Attention Space Rangers, you&#x27;ve landed on Planet Z! Be ready for anything&quot;), encountering the hostile alien lifeforms surrounding the volcano. Before leaving Planet Z, Zurg, in his secret weapon, gloats at the rookies, taunting them of his supposed victory, declaring that Star Command will be his next target after he conquers Green Planet. The rookies re-enter space via a light speed tunnel with Zs around it. Out in space, the rookie find Buzz Lightyear is using an Astro Blaster working alongside Green Squadron to take down Zurg&#x27;s Secret Weapon, Zurg distraught and frustrated at his failure. The rookies arrive on Green Planet, where the LGMs signing the receipt to return Zurg to Al&#x27;s Toy Barn. Zurg promises revenge as the Green Squadron and Buzz Lightyear thank the rookies. Buzz proceeds to remind the guests to put the Blasters in their holsters and to check their final score on the status board. Guests exit the ride to the gift shop (ie Little Green Men&#x27;s Store Command or Star Command Suppliers).

===Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland===

The Tokyo version of the ride is called Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Astro Blasters and it is the original version of the second version of the ride and all of the ride&#x27;s audio is in Japanese. At Hong Kong Disneyland, the ride was called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and a highly identical clone of the Tokyo version with a more elaborate queue, with its entrance Buzz Lightyear statue being taken from the defunct DisneyQuest Chicago&#x27;s Astro Blasters bumper car attraction. The Hong Kong version was also entirely in English, and only trilingual for safety rules. Those two versions also featured a floating Planet Z outside of the DreadNought. Their version&#x27;s cruisers are called XP 38. On November 22, 2016, Disney announced that the Hong Kong version of the ride would be closing on August 31, 2017. In its place was the park&#x27;s second Marvel-themed ride, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, which became part of a new land, Stark Expo. However, Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s version is still operating today, until it was announced on April 26, 2024 that this version would close in October of that year, to be replaced with an attraction themed to the &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; franchise to open in 2026.

===Disneyland Paris===
At Disneyland Paris, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast replaced the Circle-Vision 360° production &quot;Le Visionarium&quot;, which closed in 2004. This version of the ride is much like the Disneyland version, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, except for the presence of a tribute to &quot;Le Visionarium&quot;: When you are in the robot attack scene at the beginning, if you look beneath the left arm of the Box-O-Bot, you might be able to see 9-Eye (the Circumvisual Photodroid from &quot;Le Visionarium&quot;) hiding there. However, it is an easy to miss tribute.

In the Paris version of the ride, the dialogue is the same but translated into French as well as English. In the queue, the Buzz Lightyear animatronic speaks English, as well as French for those who speak French, and don&#x27;t understand English. Some areas of the ride provide both dialogues, but in the scene where Zurg&#x27;s weapon is half-destroyed, it switches from English to French in a 6 dialogue loop as it does in the California version of the ride. This ride&#x27;s cruiser is called the XP 41 calling back to the California version. This is also the version with the second longest indoor queue.

=== Shanghai Disneyland ===
The most recent version of this attraction is called Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue. It is based on the opening sequence of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, set on Zurg&#x27;s home planet of Xrgthung, and featuring the robots with similar designs to those seen in the film.

The rookies are brought onto the surface of the planet, encountering several Zurgbots, all of which are easily neutralized with their laser guns, and with the help of the Little Green Men, and Buzz Lightyear himself. The battle is mainly on the surface before being brought into Zurg&#x27;s bunker, in which the defense systems are activated to prevent the rookies, Little Green Men, or Buzz himself from stopping the operation. Buzz continues to assist the rookies in destroying the defense systems and robots, and eventually encounter Zurg, having thwarted his plan. The evil Emperor swears vengeance as Buzz and the Little Green Men congratulate the rookies for their assistance to Star Command.

==Other appearances==

In 2005, the Walt Disney Company premiered a home version of the ride in the form of an internet video game that allows users to connect with guests at the parks. The scores of each guest from the dark ride are tallied with the internet gamer and increase the points won.

There was also a bumper car attraction at Walt Disney World&#x27;s DisneyQuest with the name &quot;Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Astroblaster&quot; where players rode and controlled enclosed bumper cars while shooting &quot;asteroids&quot; (black foam soccer balls) at each other. Getting hit by a ball at a specific target caused the cars to spin around and flash lights for a few seconds. However, that attraction was closed when DisneyQuest shut its doors in 2017.

The 2019 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; features a virtual version of the ride as one of its &quot;Attraction Flow&quot; theme park-inspired attacks, allowing the player to attack enemies with similar mechanics and visual style as the real ride.

<doc id="1159331" wikidata="Q414445" url="?curid=1159331" title="Aluminium nitride">
<text>Aluminium nitride (AlN) is a solid nitride of aluminium. It has a high thermal conductivity of up to 321 W/(m·K) and is an electrical insulator. Its wurtzite phase (w-AlN) has a band gap of ~6 eV at room temperature and has a potential application in optoelectronics operating at deep ultraviolet frequencies.

==History and physical properties==
AlN was first synthesized in 1862 by F. Briegleb and A. Geuther.

AlN, in the pure (undoped) state has an electrical conductivity of 10−11–10−13 Ω−1⋅cm−1, rising to 10−5–10−6 Ω−1⋅cm−1 when doped. Electrical breakdown occurs at a field of 1.2–1.8 V/mm (dielectric strength). 

The material exists primarily in the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, but also has a metastable cubic zincblende phase, which is synthesized primarily in the form of thin films. It is predicted that the cubic phase of AlN (zb-AlN) can exhibit superconductivity at high pressures. In AlN wurtzite crystal structure, Al and N alternate along the c-axis, and each bond is tetrahedrally coordinated with four atoms per unit cell.

One of the unique intrinsic properties of wurtzite AlN is its spontaneous polarization. The origin of spontaneous polarization is the strong ionic character of chemical bonds in wurtzite AlN due to the large difference in electronegativity between aluminium and nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, the non-centrosymmetric wurtzite crystal structure gives rise to a net polarization along the c-axis. Compared with other III-nitride materials, AlN has a larger spontaneous polarization due to the higher nonideality of its crystal structure (Psp: AlN 0.081 C/m2 &gt; InN 0.032 C/m2 &gt; GaN 0.029 C/m2). Moreover, the piezoelectric nature of AlN gives rise to internal piezoelectric polarization charges under strain. These polarization effects can be utilized to induce a high density of free carriers at III-nitride semiconductor heterostructure interfaces completely dispensing with the need of intentional doping. Owing to the broken inversion symmetry along the polar direction, AlN thin film can be grown on either metal-polar or nitrogen-polar faces. Their bulk and surface properties depend significantly on this choice. The polarization effect is currently under investigation for both polarities. 

Critical spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization constants for AlN are listed in the table below:

AlN has high thermal conductivity, high-quality MOCVD-grown AlN single crystal has an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 321 W/(m·K), consistent with a first-principle calculation. For an electrically insulating ceramic, it is 70–210 W/(m·K) for polycrystalline material, and as high as 285 W/(m·K) for single crystals).

AlN is one of the few materials that have both a wide and direct bandgap (almost twice that of SiC and GaN) and large thermal conductivity. This is due to its small atomic mass, strong interatomic bonds, and simple crystal structure. This property makes AlN attractive for application in high speed and high power communication networks. Many devices handle and manipulate large amounts of energy in small volumes and at high speeds, so due to the electrically insulating nature and high thermal conductivity of AlN, it becomes a potential material for high-power power electronics. Among group III-nitride materials, AlN has higher thermal conductivity compared to gallium nitride (GaN). Therefore, AlN is more advantageous than GaN in terms of heat dissipation in many power and radio frequency electronic devices.

Thermal expansivity is another critical property for high temperature applications. The calculated thermal expansion coefficients of AlN at 300 K are 4.2×10−6 K−1along a-axis and 5.3×10−6 K−1 along c-axis.

==Stability and chemical properties==
Aluminium nitride is stable at high temperatures in inert atmospheres and melts at about . In a vacuum, AlN decomposes at ~. In the air, surface oxidation occurs above , and even at room temperature, surface oxide layers of 5–10 nm thickness have been detected. This oxide layer protects the material up to . Above this temperature bulk oxidation occurs. Aluminium nitride is stable in hydrogen and carbon-dioxide atmospheres up to .

The material dissolves slowly in mineral acids through grain-boundary attack and in strong alkalies through attack on the aluminium-nitride grains. The material hydrolyzes slowly in water. Aluminium nitride is resistant to attack from most molten salts, including chlorides and cryolite.

Aluminium nitride can be patterned with a Cl2-based reactive ion etch.

==Manufacture==
AlN is synthesized by the carbothermal reduction of aluminium oxide in the presence of gaseous nitrogen or ammonia or by direct nitridation of aluminium. The use of sintering aids, such as Y2O3 or CaO, and hot pressing is required to produce a dense technical-grade material.

==Applications==
Epitaxially grown thin film crystalline aluminium nitride is used for surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWs) deposited on silicon wafers because of AlN&#x27;s piezoelectric properties. Recent advancements in material science have permitted the deposition of piezoelectric AlN films on polymeric substrates, thus enabling the development of flexible SAW devices. One application is an RF filter, widely used in mobile phones, which is called a thin-film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR). This is a MEMS device that uses aluminium nitride sandwiched between two metal layers.

AlN is also used to build piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers, which emit and receive ultrasound and which can be used for in-air rangefinding over distances of up to a meter.

Metallization methods are available to allow AlN to be used in electronics applications similar to those of alumina and beryllium oxide. AlN nanotubes as inorganic quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, which are isoelectronic with carbon nanotubes, have been suggested as chemical sensors for toxic gases.

Currently there is much research into developing light-emitting diodes to operate in the ultraviolet using gallium nitride based semiconductors and, using the alloy aluminium gallium nitride, wavelengths as short as 250 nm have been achieved. In 2006, an inefficient AlN LED emission at 210 nm was reported.

AlN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have attracted a high level of attention due to AlN’s superior properties, such as better thermal management, reduced buffer leakage, and excellent integration for all nitride electronics. AlN buffer layer is a critical building block for AlN-based HEMTs, and it has been grown by using MOCVD or MBE on different substrates. Building on top of AlN buffer, n-channel devices with 2D electron gas (2DEG) and p-channel devices with 2D hole gas (2DHG) have been demonstrated. The combination of high-density 2DEG and 2DHG on the same semiconductor platform makes it a potential candidate for CMOS devices.

Aluminum oxide ceramics facilitate polymerization reactions, enhancing efficiency and consistency in creating plastics and resins. They are also used in microwave applications as a substrate and heat sink. More researchers are examining the production of light-emitting diodes(LEDs) to operate in the ultraviolet region using aluminium gallium nitride(AlGaN) based semiconductors.

Among the applications of AlN are
* opto-electronics,
* dielectric layers in optical storage media,
* electronic substrates, chip carriers where high thermal conductivity is essential,
* military applications,
* as a crucible to grow crystals of gallium arsenide,
* steel and semiconductor manufacturing.

<doc id="1159350" wikidata="Q1343705" url="?curid=1159350" title="Enragés">
<text>The Enragés (; ), commonly known as the Ultra-radicals (), were a small number of firebrands known for defending the lower class and expressing the demands of the radical &quot;sans-culottes&quot; during the French Revolution. They played an active role in the 31 May – 2 June 1793 Paris uprisings that forced the expulsion of the Girondins from the National Convention, allowing the Montagnards to assume full control. The Enragés gained their name for their angry rhetoric appealing to the National Convention to take more measures that would benefit the poor. Jacques Roux, Jean-François Varlet, Jean Théophile Victor Leclerc and Claire Lacombe, the primary leaders of the Enragés, were strident critics of the National Convention for failing to carry out the promises of the French Revolution.

The Enragés were not a unified party, but rather a set of individuals who worked for their own objectives, and evidence of cooperation between them is inconclusive. The leaders did not view themselves as part of a cohesive movement, with Roux even calling for Varlet&#x27;s arrest at one point. The notion of the Enragés as a cohesive group was perpetuated by the Jacobins, as they lumped their critics to the left into one group.

== Primary demands ==
In 1793, Jacques Roux delivered a speech at the National Convention known as the &quot;Manifesto of the Enragés&quot; that represented the essential demands of the group. He asserted that freedom and equality had thus far been &quot;vain phantoms&quot;, because the rich had profited from the French Revolution at the expense of the poor. To remedy this, he proposed measures for price controls, arguing, &quot;Those goods necessary to all should be delivered at a price accessible to all&quot;. He also called for strict punishments against actors engaged in speculation and monopoly. He demanded the National Convention take severe action to repress counterrevolutionary activity, promising to &quot;show them [enemies] those immortal pikes that overthrew the Bastille&quot;. Lastly, he accused the National Convention of ruining the finances of the state and encouraged the exclusive use of the assignat to stabilize finances.

== Formation ==
The Enragés formed in response to the Jacobins&#x27;s reluctance to restrain the capitalist bourgeois. Many Parisians feared that the National Convention protected merchants and shopkeepers at the expense of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the lower-class working peoples. The Enragés, though not a cohesive body, offered these working poor a platform to express their dissent. Their dissent was often conveyed through riots, public demonstrations and passionate oratory.

Jacques Roux and Jean-Francois Varlet emboldened the Parisian working poor to approach the Jacobin Club on 22 February 1793 and persuade them to place price controls on necessary goods. The Enragés appointed two women to represent the movement and their agenda to the National Convention. However, the Convention refused to grant them an audience. This provoked outrage and criticism throughout Paris, and some went as far as to accuse the National Convention of protecting the merchant elite&#x27;s interests at the expense of the &quot;sans-culottes.&quot; Further attempts of the Enragés to communicate their position were denied by the National Convention. Determined to be heard, they responded with revolt. They plundered the homes and businesses of the merchant elite, employing direct action to meet their needs. The Enragés were noted for using both legal and extralegal means to achieve their ends.

The Enragés were composed of members within the National Convention and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. They illuminated the internal and external war waged by the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. They complained that the National Convention ordered men to fight on the battlefield without providing for the widows and orphans remaining in France. They emphasized the unavailability of basic necessities, particularly bread. In his &quot;Manifesto of the Enragés&quot;, Jacques Roux colorfully expressed this sentiment to the National Convention, asking,

They accused the merchant aristocracy of withholding access to goods and supplies to intentionally drive up prices. Roux demanded that the National Convention impose capital punishment upon unethical merchants who used speculation, monopolies and hoarding to increase their personal profits at the expense of the poor. The Enragés labeled price gouging as counter-revolutionary and treasonous. This sentiment also extended to those who sympathized with the recently executed King Louis XVI. They felt that those who sympathized with the monarchy would also sympathize with those who hoarded goods. It is not surprising that many within the Enragés actively worked against the Girondin faction of the Convention and, indeed, contributed to the demise of the moderate Girondins, who were widely seen as having fought to spare the king. Those who adhered to the ideologies presented in the &quot;Manifesto of the Enragés&quot; wished to emphasize to the National Convention that tyranny was not just the product of monarchy, and that injustice and oppression did not end with the execution of the king. In their view, oppression existed whenever one stratum of society sought to monopolize the majority of resources while simultaneously preventing others from gaining access to those same resources. In their view, the pursuit of resources was acceptable, but the act of limiting access to resources was punishable by death.

The Enragés called on the National Convention to restrict commerce, so that it might not &quot;consist of ruining, rendering hopeless, or starving citizens&quot;. While the Enragés occasionally worked within political structures, their primary objective was achieving social and economic reform. They were a direct action group, attempting to meet the immediate needs of the working poor.

== Women in the Enragés ==
Jean-François Varlet, though a man, understood the enormous influence women possessed, particularly within the French Revolution. Varlet formed the Enragés by provoking and motivating working poor women and organizing them into a semi-cohesive mobile unit. The Enragés often appointed women as speakers to represent the movement in the National Convention. Revolutionary proto-feminists held vital positions within the Enragés, including Claire Lacombe and Pauline Léon. The proto-feminists of the French Revolution are now credited with inspiring feminist movements in the 19th century.

== Key leaders ==

=== Jacques Roux ===
Jacques Roux, a Roman Catholic priest, was a leader of the Enragés. Roux supported the common people (i.e., the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;) and republicanism. He participated in peasant movements and endorsed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, to which he swore an oath on 16 January 1791. Roux famously claimed,

Roux saw violence as a key to the French Revolution’s success. In fact, when King Louis XVI was executed in January 1793, it was Roux who led him to the scaffold.

=== Jean Varlet ===
Jean Varlet, another leader of the Enragés, played a leading role in the fall of the monarchy. When King Louis XVI attempted to flee Paris, Varlet circulated petitions in the National Assembly and spoke against the king. On 10 August 1792, the Legislative Assembly suspended the king and called for the election of a National Convention. Varlet was elected as a deputy in the new Convention. Even as a member of this representative government, though, Varlet mistrusted representation and favored direct universal suffrage which could bind representatives and recall elected legislators. He sought to prevent the wealthy from expanding their profits at the expense of the poor and called for the nationalization of all profits obtained through monopoly and hoarding.

=== Théophile Leclerc ===
In 1790, Théophile Leclerc joined the first battalion of Morbihan volunteers, remaining a member until February 1792. He gained recognition in Paris through a speech to the Jacobins attacking Louis XVI. After moving to Lyon, he joined the Central Club and married Pauline Léon, a revolutionary woman. He approved of radical violence like the other Enragés, calling for the execution of expelled Girondins after the 2 June insurrection.

=== Claire Lacombe ===
In 1793, the actress Claire Lacombe, another individual associated with the Enragés, founded the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women. This group was outraged by high costs of living, lack of necessities and awful living conditions. Lacombe was known for violent rhetoric and action. On 26 May 1793, Lacombe nearly beat to death a Girondin woman, Théroigne de Méricourt, with a whip on the benches of the Convention. She might have killed her if Jean-Paul Marat had not intervened.

== Other groups ==
To the left of the Montagnards and Hébertists, the Enragés were undermined by Montagnard leader Maximilien Robespierre and Hébertist leader Jacques Hébert, both of whom implemented some of their proposals in order to appeal to the same &quot;sans-culottes&quot; the Enragés sought to win over. Their ideas were taken up and developed by Gracchus Babeuf and his associates.

Another group styling itself as &quot;Enragés&quot; emerged in France in 1968 among students at Nanterre University. Inspired by, and closely allied with, the Situationists, these &quot;Enragés&quot; emerged as one of the leading groups in the May 1968 French protests.

<text>The Institute of Latin American Studies (ILAS) was one of nine research institutes that comprised the School of Advanced Study at the University of London. It was located in the landmarked Senate House building in Bloomsbury, central London.

Following a consultation on proposals for the future of the school in late 2020, the activity of ILAS will be continued by the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) established from April 2021 at the Institute of Modern Languages Research (IMLR), joining its six transnational and transcultural research centres.

==History==
The Institute of Latin American Studies was established in 1965 with the objective of providing a focus for research on the literature, arts, history, politics and economics of Latin America and the Caribbean. It has been part of the School of Advanced Study, the UK’s national research centre and the only institution to receive national funding to promote research in the humanities.

ILAS’s founding director was Robin Humphreys, the first professor of Latin American history and the founder of Latin American studies in the United Kingdom. Humphreys’ tenure at ILAS from 1965 to 1974 &quot;set the standards which gained for the subject academic status and funding&quot;.

Between 2004 and 2013, ILAS formed part of the Institute for the Study of the Americas (ISA), along with the Institute of United States Studies (IUSS). In August 2013, ILAS was re-established to focus solely on supporting research on Latin America and the Caribbean. From April 2021, ILAS&#x27;s activity will be continued by the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS).

==Mission==
The national and international mission of ILAS has been to support researchers engaged in scholarship in the humanities broadly defined pertaining to Latin America and the Caribbean by building and maintaining national scholarly networks; hosting visiting fellows; hosting and promoting academic events; and providing digital resources of use for the research community.

The Institute’s area studies focus has been multidisciplinary and, as part of the School of Advanced Study, has benefited from academic collaboration across a wide range of subject fields in the humanities and social sciences. Furthermore, ILAS has worked closely with cultural, diplomatic and business organizations with an interest in Latin America.

<text>Daniel Stevens Dickinson (September 11, 1800 – April 12, 1866) was an American politician and lawyer, most notable as a United States senator from 1844 to 1851.

==Biography==

Born in Goshen, Connecticut, he moved with his parents to Guilford, Chenango County, New York, in 1806. He attended the common schools, was apprenticed to a clothier, and taught school at Wheatland, New York from 1821 on. In 1822, he married Lydia Knapp, with whom he had four children: Virginia, Manco, Lydia, and Mary; Virginia died at age 20 in 1846, and Manco in 1851. He also engaged in land surveying, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1828. He commenced practice in Guilford, and served as Postmaster of Guilford from 1827 to 1832. He moved to Binghamton, New York and served as its first Village President in 1834.

He was a member of the New York State Senate (6th D.) from 1837 to 1840, sitting in the 60th, 61st, 62nd and 63rd New York State Legislatures. He was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1843 to 1844. In 1844, he was a presidential elector, voting for James K. Polk and George M. Dallas.

In 1844, he was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, and was subsequently elected to a full term, holding office from November 30, 1844, to March 3, 1851. He was Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Finance (1849–1850), a member of the Committee on Manufactures (Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth United States Congresses), and a member of the Committee on Private Land Claims (Thirty-first United States Congress). As a senator and after, Dickinson was the leader of the conservative Hunker faction of the New York Democratic Party, and would eventually become leader of the &quot;Hards&quot; who opposed reconciliation with the more radical Barnburner faction which had left the party in 1848 to join the Free Soilers. Dickinson resumed the practice of law in 1851. He was delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention, where, on the 48th ballot, after efforts to nominate Franklin Pierce had fallen short, Virginia dramatically switched its votes from Pierce to Dickinson. The enthusiastic reaction in the hall suggested that a delegate-stampede to Dickinson might have ensued, but Dickinson then addressed the convention and &quot;eloquently withdrew his own name,&quot; enabling Pierce to obtain the nomination on the next ballot. In 1853, President Pierce appointed him as Collector of the Port of New York, but he declined to take office. In 1860, he supported John C. Breckinridge for president.

He supported the Union during the American Civil War. He was elected New York State Attorney General in November 1861 on a ticket nominated by the Independent People&#x27;s state convention (War Democrats), and endorsed by the Republicans. He was appointed United States Commissioner for the final settlement of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound agricultural claims in 1864.

Dickinson was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate when Abraham Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 and desired a pro-war Democrat on the Republican ticket to demonstrate support for his war policy, but the nomination went to Andrew Johnson. Dickinson supported Lincoln&#x27;s reelection, and was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1865, an office in which he served until his death.
On April 12, 1866, Dickinson died suddenly in New York City at the residence of his son-in-law Samuel G. Courtney, and was buried at the Spring Forest Cemetery in Binghamton. His cause of death was reported as a hernia.

==Legacy==

Daniel S. Dickinson is the namesake of the village of Port Dickinson, New York (and the encompassing town), Dickinson County, Iowa, and Dickinson County, Kansas. Dickinson street in Binghamton is named after Dickinson. A bronze statue of Dickinson by Allen George Newman was erected in front of the Broome County Courthouse in Binghamton, New York in 1924.

His great-granddaughter Tracy Dickinson Mygatt was a Socialist playwright and pacifist.

<doc id="1159362" wikidata="Q774671" url="?curid=1159362" title="Growing degree-day">
<text>Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology. GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners, and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, an insect will emerge from dormancy, or a crop will reach maturity. GDD is credited to be first defined by Reaumur in 1735.

==Introduction==
In the absence of extreme conditions such as unseasonal drought or disease, plants grow in a cumulative stepwise manner which is strongly influenced by the ambient temperature. Growing degree days take aspects of local weather into account and allow gardeners to predict (or, in greenhouses, even to control) the plants&#x27; pace toward maturity.

Unless stressed by other environmental factors like moisture, the development rate from emergence to maturity for many plants depends upon the daily air temperature. Because many developmental events of plants and insects depend on the accumulation of specific quantities of heat, it is possible to predict when these events should occur during a growing season regardless of differences in temperatures from year to year. Growing degrees (GDs) is defined as the number of temperature degrees above a certain threshold base temperature, which varies among crop species. The base temperature is that temperature below which plant growth is zero. GDs are calculated each day as maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature divided by 2, minus the base temperature. GDUs are accumulated by adding each day&#x27;s GDs contribution as the season progresses.

GDUs can be used to: assess the suitability of a region for production of a particular crop; estimate the growth-stages of crops, weeds or even life stages of insects; predict maturity and cutting dates of forage crops; predict best timing of fertilizer or pesticide application; estimate the heat stress on crops; plan spacing of planting dates to produce separate harvest dates. Crop specific indices that employ separate equations for the influence of the daily minimum (nighttime) and the maximum (daytime) temperatures on growth are called crop heat units (CHUs).

==GDD calculation==
GDD are calculated by taking the integral of warmth above a base temperature, &quot;T&quot;base (plant type dependant, see baseline section):

:formula_1 (where integration is over the time period with formula_2).

A simpler, approximately equivalent formulation uses the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures compared to a &quot;T&quot;base to calculate degree-days for a given day. As an equation:

:formula_3

If the minimum temperature &quot;T&quot;min is below the &quot;T&quot;base one, there exist two variants:

* variant A: Do not change formula_4. Only if formula_5, set formula_6. The resulting GDD is 0. This can be written more compactly as: formula_7

* variant B: Change formula_8 to formula_9
GDDs are typically measured from the winter low. Any temperature below &quot;T&quot;base is set to &quot;T&quot;base before calculating the average. Likewise, the maximum temperature is usually capped at 30 °C because most plants and insects do not grow any faster above that temperature. However, some warm temperate and tropical plants do have significant requirements for days above 30 °C to mature fruit or seeds.

===Example of GDD calculation===

For example, a day with a high of 23 °C and a low of 12 °C (and a base of 10 °C) would contribute 7.5 GDDs.

:formula_10

As a second example, a day with a high of 13 °C and a low of 5 °C (and a base of 10 °C) would contribute:

* version A: 0 GDD, as: formula_11)
* version B: 1.5 GDDs, as: formula_12

==Plant development==

==Pest control==
Insect development and growing degree days are also used by some farmers and horticulturalists to time their use of organic or biological pest control or other pest control methods so they are applying the procedure or treatment at the point that the pest is most vulnerable. For example:
* Black cutworm larvae have grown large enough to start causing economic damage at 165 GDD
* Azalea lace bug emerges at about 130 GDD
* Boxwood leafminer emerges at about 250 GDD

==Honeybees==
Several beekeepers are now researching the correlation between growing degree-days and the life cycle of a honeybee colony.

==Baselines==
The optimal base temperature is often determined experimentally based on the life cycle of the plant or insect in question. Common baselines for crops are either 5 °C for cool-season plants and 10 °C for warm-season plants and most insect development. 

===Crops===
* 4.5 °C wheat, barley, rye, oats, flaxseed, lettuce, asparagus,&quot;canning purposes&quot;
* 8 °C sunflower, potato
* 10 °C maize (including sweet corn), sorghum, rice, soybeans, tomato, coffee, grapes, snap beans, lima beans
* 30 °C the USDA measure heat zones in GDD above 30 °C; for many plants this is significant for seed maturation, e.g. reed (&quot;Phragmites&quot;) requires at least some days reaching this temperature to mature viable seeds

===Pests===
* 6 °C Stalk borer
* 7 °C Corn rootworm
* 9 °C Alfalfa weevil
* 10 °C Black cutworm, European corn borer, standard baseline for insect and mite pests of woody plants
* 11 °C Green cloverworm

===Modified growing degree days===
In the cases of some plants, not only do they require a certain minimum temperature to grow, but they will also stop growing above a warmer threshold temperature. In such cases, a &quot;modified growing degree day&quot; is used: the growing degree days are calculated at the lower baseline, then at the higher baseline, which is subtracted. Corn is an example of this: it starts growing at 10 °C and stops at 30 °C, meaning any growing degree-days above 30 °C do not count.

==Units==

GDDs may be calculated in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, though they must be converted appropriately; for every 9 GDDF there are 5 GDDC, or in conversion calculation:

GDDC = 5/9 * GDDF

The equivalent unit compliant with the International System of Units is the kelvin-second. A quantity of kelvin-seconds is four orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding degree day (1 Celsius degree-day is 8.64×104 K·s; 1 Fahrenheit degree-day is 4.8×104 K·s).

<text>Troy Perkins (born July 29, 1981) is an American former soccer player. During his career, he played for clubs in the United States, Canada, and Norway. The 2006 Major League Soccer Goalkeeper of the Year award winner earned seven caps with the United States national team.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Perkins is a graduate of Thomas Worthington High School, in Worthington, OH, and played college soccer at the University of South Florida and the University of Evansville. He was named third-team All-Conference USA in 2001, and second-team All-CUSA in 2002. He transferred to Evansville for his senior season. At Evansville, he allowed only twenty-one goals in nineteen matches, compiling a 1.09 goals-against-average. Perkins also played in the PDL for the Cape Cod Crusaders in 2002.

===Professional===
Upon graduating in 2003, Perkins went undrafted. However, he was signed to a developmental contract by D.C. United. Not expected to contribute, Perkins was given an opportunity after both Nick Rimando and Doug Warren lost their starting positions. Perkins proved up to the task, and went on to start sixteen games for the team, posting a 1.62 goals against average. Although Perkins was performing well, the team suffered during his tenure, and he was replaced near the end of the season with Nick Rimando, who would also start for United throughout the playoffs.

In early 2005 he trained with Bolton Wanderers F.C., an English Premier League club and in early 2006 he trained with Everton in Liverpool.

During the 2006 season, Perkins was the starting goalkeeper for United, playing thirty of thirty-two games. He was also named 2006 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year, Best XI, and voted to the 2006 All Star Team. Perkins finished the 2007 MLS season with a 1.10 goals against average, eight shutouts, and sixteen wins, the most in the league.

On December 20, 2007, Perkins signed a five-year contract with Vålerenga, making him the first American to sign for the Norwegian club.

On January 13, 2010, returned to D.C. United in a complicated pre-draft trade deal in which United traded midfielder Fred, its first-round 2010 MLS SuperDraft pick, its #6 spot in the MLS allocation order, and allocation money to Philadelphia Union in exchange for the Union&#x27;s #1 spot in the allocation order. D.C. then used the #1 allocation ranking to re-acquire Perkins. Attempts were made to sign him by Feyenoord and several French clubs, but nothing materialized and he returned to D.C. United.

On December 17, 2010, Perkins was traded to Portland Timbers for goalkeeper Steve Cronin and allocation money. Perkins went into camp as the Timbers&#x27; first choice goalkeeper, but he missed the first six Timbers games after a knee injury Perkins suffered in training. Despite the injury, Perkins notched the Timbers&#x27; first-ever league shutout with their 1–0 victory over Real Salt Lake on April 30, 2011.

Perkins signed a new contract with Portland on November 28, 2011.

Perkins began the 2012 season with the Timbers, however, on August 7, 2012, Perkins was traded to Montreal Impact for veteran Jamaican goaltender Donovan Ricketts. Perkins stayed with Montreal through the 2014 season.

On January 13, 2015, Perkins signed with Seattle Sounders FC.

On January 11, 2016, Perkins announced his retirement and joined the Seattle Sounders FC Academy as a staff member.

===International===
Perkins has also played for the United States National Team, receiving his first cap against Sweden on January 21, 2009.

==Personal life==
While being a backup goalkeeper for D.C. United, Perkins also had a second job working at a sporting goods store in Fair Lakes, VA called Galyans (which is currently known as Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods). Beginning in 2006, Perkins worked a second job as a mortgage loan processor, leading United fans to put up a banner that said, &quot;Troy Saves – and Loans.&quot;

Perkins has revealed that his return to MLS in 2010 was because his wife was unable to settle in Norway.

Perkins considers that his training as a mortgage loan processor is important and has stated, &quot;Goalies can usually play until they&#x27;re around 40, so you have to think about a job after retirement,&quot; He has an &quot;austere pregame routine, which entails shutting off all electronics and not talking to anyone for 24 hours. &#x27;I&#x27;m a miserable person to be around,&#x27; he says, laughing. &#x27;My wife hates it.&#x27;&quot;

After retiring from professional soccer and leaving the Sounders organization, Perkins was sworn in as a police officer in Kennewick, Washington in January 2017.

<text>Jackass Flats is a shallow alluvial basin located in the southwest portion of the Nevada National Security Site in Nye County, Nevada, United States. The area lies east of Yucca Mountain, south of the Calico Hills and Shoshone Mountain and northwest of Skull Mountain. The valley drains to the southwest via the Tonopah and Fortymile washes into the Amargosa Valley across US Route 95 at the town of Amargosa Valley, Nevada. The &quot;flat&quot; covers an area of approximately and ranges in elevation from about just north of US 95 to at the mountain bases to the north and east.

It is located mostly within Area 25 and extends into Area 14 and Area 26.

It was the test site of nuclear-powered rocket engines during project Project Rover and NERVA.

<doc id="1159407" wikidata="Q2496306" url="?curid=1159407" title="Homeosis">
<text>In evolutionary developmental biology, homeosis is the transformation of one organ into another, arising from mutation in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical genes, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis. In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a stamen or petals to the development of chlorophyll. Homeosis may be caused by mutations in Hox genes, found in animals, or others such as the MADS-box family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped insects become as successful and diverse as they are.

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the &quot;Ultrabithorax&quot; genotype gives a phenotype wherein metathoracic and first abdominal segments become mesothoracic segments. Another well-known example is &quot;Antennapedia&quot;: a gain-of-function allele causes legs to develop in the place of antennae.

In botany, Rolf Sattler has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.

Homeotic mutants in angiosperms are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant &quot;Clarkia&quot; (Onagraceae), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating in a mutation of a single gene. The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of &quot;Clarkia&quot;, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by Ed Lewis, the phenomenology of homeosis in animals was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many homeotic proteins. 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the homeodomain, while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the homeobox. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the Hox genes, although many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal genomes than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a &quot;selector&quot; as proposed by Antonio Garcia-Bellido. 
By definition selectors were imagined to be (transcription factor) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a tissue. 
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or (mutant) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by Michael Akam in a so-called &quot;post-selector gene&quot; model that incorporated additional findings and &quot;walked back&quot; the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; of selector-dependent stable binary switches.

The concept of tissue compartments is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal&#x27;s body plan.
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by Albert Erives and colleagues by focusing on enhancer DNAs that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the transcription factors that function as homeotic selectors versus the transcription factors that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the Notch signaling pathway and the BMP signaling pathway.
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to &quot;license&quot; enhancer DNAs in a restricted tissue compartment so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via polyglutamine-mediated aggregation.

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex multicellularity seen in animals, the multicellularity of land plants is developmentally organized into tissue and organ units via transcription factor genes with homeotic effects.
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess MADS-box DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number MADS-box factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of multicellularity in plants and animals, different eukaryotic transcription factor families were co-opted to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by Michael Akam.

<text>A counterattack is a tactic employed in response to an attack, with the term originating in &quot;war games&quot;. The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, while the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy (this may take the form of an opposing sports team or military units).

A counter-offensive is a broad-scale counterattack. The counter-offensive is executed after exhausting the enemy&#x27;s frontline troops and after the enemy reserves had been committed to combat and proven incapable of breaching defenses, but &quot;before&quot; the enemy has had the opportunity to assume new defensive positions. Sometimes the counter-offensive can be of a more limited operational maneuver nature, with more limited objectives rather than those seeking attainment of a strategic goal. A counter-offensive was considered by Clausewitz to be the most efficient means of forcing the attacker to abandon offensive plans. Counter-offensives can be executed not only on land, but also by the naval, and air forces. Strategic counter-offensives have been recorded by military historians in many wars throughout military history. Although not always known as such, because they are usually described by historians in conjunction with the defensive phase, such as the Battle of Moscow.

A saying, attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte illustrates the tactical importance of the counterattack : &quot;the greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory&quot;. In the same spirit, in his Battle Studies, Ardant du Pic noticed that &quot;he, general or mere captain, who employs every one in the storming of a position can be sure of seeing it retaken by an organised counter-attack of four men and a corporal&quot;.

A counterattack is a military tactic that occurs when one side successfully fends off the enemy’s attack and begins to push the enemy back with an attack of its own. In order to perform a successful counterattack, the defending side must quickly and decisively strike the enemy after defending, with the objective of shocking and overwhelming the enemy. The main concept of the counterattack is to catch the enemy by surprise. Many historical counterattacks were successful because the enemy was off guard and not expecting the counterattack.

== Analyzing historical counterattacks ==

In the past, there have been many notable counterattacks which have changed the course of a war. To be specific, Operation Bagration and the Battle of Austerlitz are good examples of the proper execution of a counterattack.

=== Operation Bagration ===
Operation Bagration is one of the largest counteroffensives in military history. In the summer of 1944 the assault, made up by roughly 1.7 million Red Army soldiers, succeeded in putting the Red Army on the offensive in the Eastern Front, as well as recapturing a large portion of the Soviet Union territory that Nazi Germany had captured 3 years prior in the summer of 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.

The Soviet counterattack focused on Belorussia, but prior to the counterattack starting, the Soviet Union fooled Nazi military leaders into believing that the attack would take place further south, near Ukraine.

To aid the deception, the Red Army established fake army camps in Ukraine and after German reconnaissance planes reported Soviet troop concentrations in the area, panzer and infantry divisions were rushed south from Belorussia, leaving it vulnerable to a major assault.

To support the attack, partisan groups in German-controlled territory were instructed to destroy German railroads to hamper German efforts to transport supplies and troops throughout the occupied territories and further weaken German Army Group Centre in Ukraine.

On 22 June 1944, the attack on Belarus by 1.7 million Soviet troops began and overwhelmed the depleted Germans defenders.

On 3 July, the Red Army captured Minsk, and later the rest of Belorussia.

Operation Bagration was a huge Soviet success and opened a direct route to Berlin after the fall of Belorussia, leading to the Red Army beginning to take over the territory that had been taken by the Wehrmacht three years before.

=== Battle of Austerlitz ===
Another military battle that utilized the counterattack tactic was the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. While fighting the Austrian and Russian armies, Napoleon purposely made it seem as if his men were weak from the fighting in several cases. Napoleon had his men retreat in an attempt to lure the Allies to battle. He purposely left his right flank open and vulnerable. This deceived the Allies into attacking and the Allies fell into Napoleon&#x27;s trap. When the Allied troops went to attack Napoleon’s right flank, Napoleon quickly filled up the right flank so the attack was not effective. However, on the Allied side, a large gap was left open in the middle of the Allied front line due to troops leaving to attack the French right flank. Noticing the large hole in the middle of the Allied lines, Napoleon attacked the middle and had his forces also flank around both sides, eventually surrounding the Allies. With the Allies completely surrounded, the battle was over. The Battle of Austerlitz was a successful counterattack because the French army defended off the Allied attack and quickly defeated the Allies. Napoleon deceived the Allies. He made his men seem weak and near defeat.

=== Battle of St. Vith ===

The Battle of St. Vith was part of the Battle of the Bulge, which began on 16 December 1944, and represented the right flank in the advance of the German center, 5th &quot;Panzer-Armee&quot; (Armored Army), toward the ultimate objective of Antwerp. Given the task of countering the German advance, US General Bruce C. Clarke decided that a mobile defense was the best solution. Knowing that the German army was aiming for an objective far behind the battle line, he decided that they could afford to lose a few kilometers a day - the idea being that a slowing down of the advance was as good as stopping them outright, since the Germans were limited by time.

The mobile defense he used at St. Vith involved the use of M36 tank destroyers acting as a base of fire to resist the oncoming German armored thrust, slowing them down enough to then counter-attack them with a force of M4 Sherman tanks. Artillery and Infantry were involved in this process as a combined arms force. The key was not to engage the Germans in a pitched battle, but to slow their advance enough to ruin their offensive timetable. The counter-attacks ensured that the German forces could not break through the slowly retreating forces. Clarke&#x27;s success was one of the first times armor had been used in a mobile defense.

<text>The &quot;Last Post&quot; is a British and Commonwealth bugle call used at military funerals, and at ceremonies commemorating those who have died in war.

==Versions==
The &quot;Last Post&quot; is either an A or a B♭ bugle call, primarily within British infantry and Australian infantry regiments, or a D or an E♭ cavalry trumpet call in British cavalry and Royal Regiment of Artillery (Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery).

Its duration varies typically from a little over one minute to nearly three minutes. For ceremonial use, the &quot;Last Post&quot; is often followed by &quot;The Rouse&quot;, or less frequently the longer &quot;Reveille&quot;.

The two regimental traditions have separate music for the call. While the B♭ infantry bugle version is better known, the E♭ cavalry trumpet version is used by the state trumpeters of the Household Cavalry.

==Origin==

The &quot;First Post&quot; call signals the start of the duty officer&#x27;s inspection of a British Army camp&#x27;s sentry posts, sounding a call at each one. First published in the 1790s, the &quot;Last Post&quot; call originally signalled merely that the final sentry post had been inspected, and the camp was secure for the night.

Its use in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Commonwealth nations has two generally unexpressed purposes: the first is an implied summoning of the spirits of the Fallen to the cenotaph, the second is to symbolically end the day, so that the period of silence before the &quot;Rouse&quot; is blown becomes in effect a ritualised night vigil. The &quot;Last Post&quot; as sounded at the end of inspection typically lasted for about 45 seconds; when sounded ceremonially with notes held for longer, pauses extended, and the expression mournful, typical duration could be 75 seconds or more.

From the 17th century, the British infantry had used drums to make signals in camp or on the battlefield, while the cavalry used trumpets. The first infantry drumbeat of the day was Reveille, while the last was Tattoo. This originated with British troops stationed in the Netherlands, after the Dutch call at the end of the day, &quot;Doe den tap toe&quot;, meaning &quot;Close the tap&quot;, a signal that beer taps had to be shut and that soldiers drinking outside the camp should return.

The difficulty of hearing drumbeat signals over the noise of gunfire led to the gradual introduction of the bugle, an instrument used by the Hanoverian Army, during the reign of King George III. The bugle was found especially useful for the mobile tactics of the light infantry and the newly formed King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in the American War of Independence. A number of different systems were introduced across various parts of the army, and in 1798, James Hyde, a trumpeter in the Royal Opera House and a trumpet-major in the local Volunteer Corps, was asked to &quot;revise the trumpet and bugle soundings, and to reduce them to uniformity, which is hereafter to be strictly observed in all regiments and corps of cavalry in His Majesty&#x27;s service&quot;. 

The result was published in the same year as &quot;The Sounds for Duty and Exercise&quot;. Hyde was dissatisfied with this edition and in 1799, produced another version with an additional chapter entitled &quot;The Bugle Horn Duty for the Light Infantry as used by the Foot Guards&quot;; this included the first known score for the Last Post, under the title of &quot;Setting the Watch&quot;. It is likely that Hyde used an amalgamation of existing calls; suggestions that the melody was inspired by Joseph Haydn lack any direct evidence.

==Memorial usage==
During the 19th century, the &quot;Last Post&quot; was also carried to the various countries of the British Empire. In all these countries, it has been incorporated into military funerals, where it is sounded as a final farewell, symbolising the fact that the duty of the dead soldier is over and that they can rest in peace.

&quot;Last Post&quot; is used in public ceremonials commemorating the war dead, particularly on Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth of Nations. In Australia and New Zealand it is also sounded on Anzac Day, usually before the two-minute silence, which concludes with &quot;The Rouse&quot;.

When the post is sounded during services such as Anzac Day, it is required of all current serving military members to salute for the duration of the call. During services organised by the Royal British Legion, it is expected that no salute is given during the &quot;Last Post&quot; and Silence, as all personnel will have removed head dress as in church service prayer, have heads bowed, weapons inverted, and flags and standards lowered.

In Ireland, the &quot;Last Post&quot; as with the Commonwealth is sounded during memorial services, funerals and commemorations. The difference where the Irish are concerned is that the accompaniment of drums is incorporated into the performance.

In India, Last Post is played at the Amar Jawan Jyoti on Republic Day and &quot;Kargil Vijay Diwas&quot; (Kargil Victory Day).

==Menin Gate==


Since 1928, the &quot;Last Post&quot; has been sounded every evening at 8 p.m. by buglers of the local Last Post Association at the war memorial at Ypres in Belgium known as the Menin Gate, commemorating the dead at the Battle of Ypres during the First World War. The only exception to this was during the four years of the German occupation of Ypres from 20 May 1940 to 6 September 1944, when the ceremony moved to Brookwood Military Cemetery in England.

On the evening that Polish forces liberated Ypres, the ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate, in spite of the heavy fighting still going on in other parts of the town. These buglers or trumpeters, sometimes seen in fire brigade uniform, are members of the fire brigade representing the Last Post Association, who organizes the events. The Last Post Association uses both silver B♭ bugles and E♭ cavalry trumpets, with either British Army tradition being respected during services at the gate.

The Last Post ceremony has now been held more than 30,000 times. On 9 July 2015, a ceremony titled &quot;A tribute to the tribute&quot; took place to commemorate the 30,000th ceremony.

==Other uses==

The &quot;Last Post&quot; was incorporated into the finale of Robert Steadman&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, a choral work on the subject of remembrance. It is also incorporated into Karl Jenkins&#x27;s orchestral mass &quot;The Armed Man&quot;, and in the movement entitled &quot;Small Town&quot;, in Peter Sculthorpe&#x27;s 1963 chamber orchestra work &quot;The Fifth Continent&quot;. A slightly altered version forms part of the slow movement of the &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; of Ralph Vaughan Williams and the ending of Mike Sammes&#x27; choral setting of Laurence Binyon&#x27;s poem &quot;For the Fallen&quot;.

Robert Graves&#x27;s poem &quot;The Last Post&quot; describes a soldier&#x27;s funeral during World War I. Ford Madox Ford used &quot;The Last Post&quot; as title for part of his tetralogy &quot;Parade&#x27;s End.&quot;

In 2015, Lee Kernaghan recorded a version for his album &quot;Spirit of the Anzacs&quot;.

The &quot;Last Post&quot; was performed in 2015 at the state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore.

&quot;The Last Post&quot; is the title of a theatre play by David Owen Smith and Peter Came performed during Armistice Week at Lincoln Drill Hall, Lincoln in November 2014. The play concerns the Beechey family of Lincoln, UK. Amy Beechey had eight sons who all enlisted to fight during the First World War; only three of them survived. The bugle call is sounded during the final moments of the play. The play was directed by Janie Smith and performed by people of Lincoln.

British Forces Broadcasting Service radio stations would play the &quot;Last Post&quot; before the National Anthem at closedown.

<doc id="1159419" wikidata="Q1565629" url="?curid=1159419" title="HMS Valiant (S102)">
<text>The sixth and most recent HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; was the second of Britain&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarines, and the first of the two-unit .

==Construction==
She was ordered on 31 August 1960 and laid down 22 January 1962 at Vickers-Armstrongs in Barrow-in-Furness. The basic design concept was to use the forward design of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; together with an aft end consisting of all British nuclear machinery based on the Dounreay prototype.

She was launched on 3 December 1963 by Lady Thorneycroft, and finally entered service 18 July 1966.

==Operational history==

She was refitted in 1970, 1977 and 1989.

In 1977 &quot;Valiant&quot; was trailing a Soviet submarine in the eastern Mediterranean when she suffered a salt water pipe leak, which flooded the reactor compartment with sea water. The reactor was shut down and the compartment pumped dry and after a clean-up of the compartment, the reactor was taken under power again. &quot;Valiant&quot; took part in the Falklands War in 1982, arriving in the war zone on 17 May. She transmitted more than 300 early air-warning alerts and spent 101 days on patrol off Argentina&#x27;s Patagonian coast. On 23 May, &quot;Valiant&quot; suffered minor damage while submerged off Rio Grande when an Argentine fighter coming back from a mission jettisoned its bombs near the submarine in order to secure a safe landing.
In November 2010, it was reported in Hansard that &quot;Valiant&quot; had run aground in the North Norwegian Sea in March 1991.

Following the development of engine trouble in June 1994, she was paid off on 12 August 1994.

Her hull and reactor are currently laid up afloat at Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth, Devon, until facilities are available for the long term storage of her radioactive components.

&quot;Courageous&quot; was selected for the museum ship to represent the SSN fleet of the Royal Navy during the Cold War. Components were removed from &quot;Valiant&quot; to restore &quot;Courageous&quot;.

<doc id="1159427" wikidata="Q3239055" url="?curid=1159427" title="Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Central Suffolk and North Ipswich is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Patrick Spencer of the Conservative Party.

== Constituency profile ==
Central Suffolk and North Ipswich was a safe seat for the Conservative Party, primarily made up of rural farming communities and retirement properties. The exception to this are the three wards from Ipswich Borough Council, which polarise support between the Conservatives and Labour, and Kesgrave, a new satellite town, which shows strong support for the Conservatives. The rural areas which make up the majority of the constituency, consistently return a majority of Conservative councillors. The local government make up of the seat, in respect of the number of borough and district councillors elected by party is 27 Conservative, 5 Labour, 4 Independent, 3 Liberal Democrat, and 2 Green. (Barking by-election 2016 was a Green gain). Significant Green gains were made in the 2023 District council elections.

==History==
The county constituency was formed for the 1997 general election, largely from eastern parts of the abolished constituency of Central Suffolk, including the north-western wards of the Borough of Ipswich. It also included western fringes of Suffolk Coastal.

Sir Michael Lord, knighted in 2001, who had held the predecessor seat of Central Suffolk, was the first MP who served the seat, from 1997 until 2010. The 2010 general election saw the fourth win for a Conservative with the election of Dan Poulter, who retained the seat at the three subsequent elections. Dan Poulter announced his defection to Labour in April 2024, and did not seek re-election. Following the 2024 election, the MP is Patrick Spencer for the Conservative Party.

== Boundaries and boundary changes ==
=== 1997–2010 ===
* The District of Mid Suffolk wards of Barham, Barking, Bramford, Claydon, Creeting, Debenham, Eye, Fressingfield, Helmingham, Hoxne, Mendlesham, Palgrave, Stonham, Stradbroke, Wetheringsett, Weybread, and Worlingworth;

* The District of East Suffolk wards of: Carlford &amp; Fynn Valley; Framlingham; Kesgrave; Rushmere St. Andrew; Wickham Market.

* The District of Mid Suffolk wards of: Battisford &amp; Ringshall; Blakenham; Bramford; Claydon &amp; Barham; Debenham; Needham Market; Stonham.

<doc id="1159442" wikidata="Q1660790" url="?curid=1159442" title="In the Garden (Eurythmics album)">
<text>In the Garden is the debut studio album by the British new wave duo Eurythmics. It was released on 16 October 1981 by RCA Records.

The album was co-produced with krautrock producer Conny Plank at his studio in Cologne, and features numerous guest musicians including Blondie drummer Clem Burke, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft drummer Robert Görl, and Can duo Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit. Plank had previously worked with the duo whilst they were in their previous band the Tourists.

Two singles were released from the album in the UK, &quot;Never Gonna Cry Again&quot; and &quot;Belinda&quot;. Neither the album nor the singles achieved much commercial success, although &quot;Never Gonna Cry Again&quot; charted at number 63 in the UK singles chart.

On 14 November 2005, RCA repackaged and released Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue as &quot;2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues&quot;. The re-issue of &quot;In the Garden&quot; added the B-sides from the album&#x27;s two singles, plus three tracks recorded live on the accompanying tour.

==Background==
Stewart first met Lennox in 1977 at the health food restaurant Pippins, where she was a waitress. During that time, Lennox was studying at Royal Academy of Music and Stewart was performing in the band Longdancer with Peet Coombes. The two became romantically involved after Stewart heard Lennox play some of her compositions on a harmonium. They later formed the Tourists with Coombs, who acted as the band&#x27;s primary songwriter and lead vocalist. Lennox sang harmony vocals in The Tourists and played a Vox keyboard that once belonged to John Lennon while Stewart served as the band&#x27;s guitarist. However, the band collapsed in part due to Coombe&#x27;s drug dependency. Stewart ended their romantic relationship around the time the Tourists dissolved, although the two still remained on amicable terms and formed Eurythmics in 1980.

The formation of Eurythmics occurred during a New Year&#x27;s Eve Party hosted by Conny Plank at his recording studio in Germany. At the party, Stewart and Lennox encountered Robert Görl, who was the drummer of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft. The three held a jam session at Plank&#x27;s studio that night and listened to music with Jaki Liebezeit and Holger Czukay. They recorded a series of demos at the insistence of Plank, who subsequently secured a record deal for the band with RCA Records. Plank served as the producer for &quot;In the Garden&quot; and received one third of the royalties generated from the album.

Stewart encouraged Lennox to ask Clem Burke of Blondie to contribute additional drums on the album. Lennox first encountered Burke playing Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Autoamerican&quot; at a New York club and successfully convinced him to accompany them to Germany for the recording sessions.

Lennox reflected in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot; that the album title was a metaphor for &quot;a place of change. It mixes growth and death with optimism and pessimism.&quot;

==Recording==
During the development of &quot;In the Garden&quot;, which was done in a farmhouse outside of Cologne, Plank travelled between recording studios to work with Ultravox. Stewart characterized the band&#x27;s experience in Germany as something that &quot;left a really big impression on us&quot; Plank and several session members encouraged Stewart to incorporate a variety of sonic textures into their songs. Stewart first developed an interest in field recordings as a child and had experimented with recording sounds from a bakery adjacent to his house. On &quot;In the Garden&quot;, Conny Plank and Holger Czukay from Can and Jaki [Liebezeit] would teach me to just record all different kind of sounds and mix them into the actual track—and even if you can&#x27;t identify them, the whole track comes alive. I&#x27;ve always done that ever since, and it all goes back to being a kid and making a recording in the baking shop.

Stewart&#x27;s interest in found sounds manifested in the atmospheric playground noises in &quot;English Summer&quot; and what Nick DeRiso of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; describe as &quot;weirdly disembodied voices&quot; in &quot;All the Young People&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;She&#x27;s Invisible Now&quot; features a typewriter as musical counterpoint and &quot;Revenge&quot; is layered with the sound of a woman&#x27;s satisfied laughs.

In an effort to distance himself from the music of the Tourists, Stewart sold two of his guitars and replaced them with a Roland TR-606 drum machine, a Roland Space Echo, and a synthesiser. Stewart explained that this decision was partially in response to a perceived pivot away from guitar-oriented albums in England. &quot;The punk movement had happened and had annihilated anything to do with guitar records. If you were in England, it was a joke if you just made a normal guitar record.&quot; Lennox commented that the experimental nature of the album was a byproduct of their desire to forge a new musical identity distinct from the Tourists.

Plank encouraged the band to experiment with microphone placement during the recording process; this resulted in microphones being suspended up in a barn and dangling over a well in certain instances. Stewart later credited Plank with sharing techniques that prepared him to become a record producer.

==Release==
&quot;In the Garden&quot; was released on 16 October 1981, and was a commercial failure, failing to chart, and receiving insufficient promotion from RCA Records. DeRiso writes: &quot;Maybe it was a bit too weird. Record buyers stayed away in droves, as &quot;In the Garden&quot; failed to chart anywhere. RCA tried floating a pair of singles, but &#x27;Never Gonna Cry Again&#x27; stalled at No. 63. &#x27;Belinda&#x27; sank without a trace. It wasn&#x27;t exactly an auspicious beginning for Eurythmics, but Lennox and Stewart were battle hardened after having already overcome so much.&quot; In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (1999), Justin Lewis comments on how the album&#x27;s &quot;European electronic sound&quot; was a departure from the power pop with which the Tourists were associated but which was now unfashionable; as a result, &quot;the critics didn&#x27;t know quite what to make of their new sound. It didn&#x27;t quite fit with New Romanticism – the new fad.&quot;

For the album&#x27;s accompanying tour, the band decided to forgo amplifiers and instead connected their equipment into a mixing console situated onstage adjacent to the drummer. The sound was projected through a PA system; some studio monitors were also used for sound reference. Stewart compared the setup to a &quot;giant HI-FI turned up&quot; and noted that the audio quality was a source of confusion for certain audience members, who incorrectly believed that the band was miming their parts due to the lack of unwanted noise emanating from the speakers. Rehearsals took place at the Mix, a makeshift studio located in an attic above a Camden timber factory. The location housed three keyboards, a double-neck guitar, a mixing console and two tape recorders.

==Reception==

In a favourable review in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, Tim de Lisle commented &quot;The ex-Tourists pack their bags and leave the safe pastures of pure English pop for the electronic delights of Cologne and superstar producer Connie Plank. On the way, they mug up on their Ultravox, Bowie, and Joy Division without forgetting their own roots, and the result is an intelligent, accessible first album.&quot; 

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic thought that Lennox&#x27;s &quot;ethereal&quot; vocals were more subdued on &quot;In the Garden&quot; compared to the band&#x27;s subsequent releases. He further described the album&#x27;s production as having a &quot;distant, mechanistic feel of the European electronic music movement, but less of the pop sensibility of later Eurythmics.&quot; Steven Grant and Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; noted how Lenox and Stewart formed Eurythmics to translate their love of &quot;Germanic experimental/electronic music&quot; into a British context, deeming the &quot;alluring&quot; album to be &quot;filled with lyrical love songs (&#x27;Belinda&#x27;) and gently strident social anthems, like &#x27;All the Young (People of Today)&#x27; and &#x27;Your Time Will Come.&#x27; Empowering it all are Lennox’s captivating, flexible but strong vocals and a commitment and humor that turn potentially pretentious material into unaffected, poetic work.&quot;

Barry Walters of &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) writes that &quot;In the Garden&quot; &quot;updates British guitar-based psychedelia with German electronics&quot; with members of Can, Blondie and industrial dance pioneers Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, &quot;names that say everything you need to know about the duo&#x27;s early ambitions. Vague, muddled, breathy, and not very good, it does sound strikingly contemporary today.&quot; Also noting the contributions from members of Can, Martin C. Strong of &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; (2006) called &quot;In the Garden&quot; a &quot;radical musical departure&quot; from the Tourists, adding: &quot;Icy synth-pop with avant-garde tendencies, the band&#x27;s closest musical compadres were the lipstick &#x27;n&#x27; legwarmers &#x27;New Romantic&#x27; crowd, although Eurythmics&#x27; vision was unique. So unique, in fact, that the record languished in relative obscurity, given scant support by R.C.A.&quot; In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1997), Colin Larkin named it &quot;a rigidly electronic sounding album, very Germanic, haunting and cold.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Classic Pop&quot; ranked &quot;In the Garden&quot; at number 40 in their list of the top 40 debut albums of the 1980s, deeming it a &quot;fascinating outlier&quot; in Eurythmics&#x27; discography, one which is often overlooked in favour of the straightforward pop records &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot; (both 1983). The magazine write that Conny Plank&#x27;s experimentalism &quot;coaxes gutsy post-punk material from the duo; Stewart’s heavy guitar on &#x27;Belinda&#x27; recalls the razorcut riffing of Keith Levene&#x27;s work on PiL&#x27;s &#x27;Public Image&#x27; single. And the icy synths of &#x27;Take Me To Your Heart&#x27; are the first signpost to their eventual electronic direction.&quot; Simon Reynolds writes that, after &quot;briefly flirting with the experimental vanguard&quot; on &quot;In the Garden&quot;, Eurythmics subsequently moved in a New Pop direction.

<text>Public transport bus services form a significant part of public transport in Singapore, with over 3.6 million rides taken per day on average as of December 2021. There are over 300 scheduled bus services and over 100 short-trip variants, operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore. The newest bus operator, Go-Ahead Singapore, started operations on 4 September 2016. In total, there are around 5,800 buses in operation as of 2024.

==History==
===Early history===

Buses were first introduced into Singapore when the Singapore Traction Company (STC) was established under the Singapore Traction Company Ordinance of 1925 to replace the ill-fated electric tramway with a trolleybus system. The first trolleybuses began operations on 14 August 1926 between Joo Chiat Road and Tanjong Pagar whereas trams were phased out by 1927, with 66 trolleybuses plying on six routes with a mileage of 15” by 30 September that year. The STC later phased in motorbuses in 1929 when seven Dennis G-type buses began plying between Geylang and Finlayson Green before being transferred to serve Seletar.

However, the STC faced heavy competition from “mosquito-buses”, a form of informal paratransit operated using privately owned modified Ford Model T vehicles. Reckless driving of such “mosquito-buses” led to the government imposing heavy regulation on them, including having to stop at fixed stops (1923) and speed limits (1927). By 1935, “mosquito-buses” were replaced with more formalised bus services with the former “mosquito-bus” owners establishing what came to be known as the Chinese bus companies; these Chinese-operated buses connected the rural parts of Singapore to the town as opposed to the inner town services of the STC.

During the Japanese Occupation during the Second World War, all bus operations were briefly unified under the , fuel shortages then led to some buses being charcoal-powered.

===1950s-1960s: Post-war recovery and troubles===

After the end of the war, the British Military Administration (BMA) was established to oversee the rebuilding of British institutions in its Malayan and Singapore colonies. Under the BMA, the STC slowly returned to normal operations with much of the dilapidated bus fleet replaced with newer motorbuses of the Albion make whereas the Chinese bus companies sought after numerous British makes such as Vulcan and Bedford. On the other hand, trolleybus operations were scaled down with only 50 new Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies-built trolleybuses procured as opposed the original 108 AEC-built trolleybuses from the pre-war period. Trolleybuses were eventually phased out by 1962 and were replaced by new Isuzu-built motorbuses.

Unfortunately the 1950s boded bad times for both the STC and the Chinese bus companies. General discontent on the poor working conditions, coupled with a highly politicised environment in the 1950s, led to many of their workers joining labour unions such as the STC Employee&#x27;s Union and the Singapore Bus Workers’ Union (SBWU). Labour unrest led to transport paralysis, with two notorious incidents being the Hock Lee bus riots in 1955 (that year alone saw 57 strikes) and a 146-day-long Great STC Strike in 1956, the latter which further accelerated the decline of the STC when Chinese bus companies established their presence in the inner city with replacement bus services. Illegal “pirate taxis” also flourished during this time, offering a form of relief for stranded commuters although they were also notorious for unsafe driving practices and cost the bus companies and legitimate taxi drivers much losses.

The severity of the situation demanded immediate action from the government; in 1956 five Commissioners led by Mr L.C. Hawkins of the London Transport Executive published a report that recommended nationalisation of public transport but little was followed up by the government then.

===1970s: Bus reorganization and mergers===


Five years after the independence of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965, the government published a White Paper to study into an overhaul on bus services; this was followed by the Wilson Report published by Australian transport consultant R.P. Wilson, who not only reaffirmed the need for rationalisation of bus transport but also provided detailed recommendations on bus routes, frequencies, fares, vehicle specifications, bus stop and terminal design and maintenance standards.

In April 1971, the 10 Chinese bus companies were merged to form three larger regional bus companies, namely Amalgamated Bus Company in the west, Associated Bus Services in the east, and United Bus Company in the north. The STC retained its presence in central Singapore but lost its privileges previously granted by the 1925 STC Ordinance. Unable to cope with existing financial difficulties and competition from the regional companies, the STC eventually discontinued bus operations in 1971, with its remaining bus fleet being split up between the three regional companies. Service quality did not make great improvement however, with breakdowns and complaints from passengers being very common. Eventually in 1973, the Singapore government persuaded the three regional companies to merge to form a single entity called Singapore Bus Services (SBS).

SBS inherited many problems from its Chinese predecessors, including use of 14 non-standard bus models that frequently broke down, poor standards among the staff and inadequate infrastructure. Hence, the government seconded a Government Team of Officials to SBS in 1974 to overhaul the management and culture. Under the supervision of the GTO, SBS completely overhauled their bus fleet with new buses of usually the Albion Viking or Mercedes-Benz OF1413 makes and introduced a rigorous maintenance regime, improving the reliability of their buses greatly whereas a new disciplinary code was introduced, reducing complaints by half from 1979 to 1983. The government also helped to further alleviate the burden from SBS by introducing priority bus lanes to speed up bus services and introduced Scheme B bus services operated by private companies in 1974.

In 1977, SBS introduced into service its first double-decker buses, the Leyland Atlantean AN68 on route 86 between Tampines Way and Shenton Way.

In light of dissatisfaction over bus services in the Jurong area and requests for improved coverage, SBS started a reorganisation of bus services across the country, starting with Jurong. This consisted of a network of internal services serving a town, with external services terminating at a point in the town, along with bus interchanges to serve as such termini. Additional depots were also constructed, which SBS claimed gave them more control over bus operations.

In 1975, one-man operation (OMO) that charged a flat fare (for the case of SBS; TIBS opted for a distance fare) was introduced to cut manpower costs; this was followed by a one-man operated ticketing operation (OTS) in 1982. By 1984, bus conductors were completely phased out.

By 1978, SBS was in a healthy position to be publicly listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange as SBS (1978) Limited.

===1980s-1990s: Market competition===

By the 1980s, SBS had managed to modernise its fleet with new buses such as the Volvo B57, Mercedes-Benz OF1417 and the Leyland Atlantean AN68. By 1982 however, there was concerns that SBS might turn complacent. To ensure that SBS remain competitive, the government gave Ng Ser Miang of Singapore Shuttle Bus (SSB, one of the two operators of City Shuttle Service) the green light to set up a second operator. Named as Trans-Island Bus Service (TIBS), TIBS started operations the following year with a modest fleet of 90 Hino buses on routes 160 and 167. By 1988, the company had expanded its operations to encompass Woodlands and Yishun and operated 328 buses on 214 routes and had taken over SSB.

In 1984, SBS trialled its first air-conditioned buses, the Mercedes-Benz OF1413/61, on route 168. Following various trials of different air-conditioned demonstrators, SBS made its first bulk order for air-conditioned buses in 1989, the Scania N113CRB. When the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) opened in 1987, bus services were further rationalised such that buses complemented the MRT by “feeding” commuters into the MRT network. Fares for both buses and the MRT were also coordinated together from 1987 with the setting of the Public Transport Council that year whereas magnetic stored value cards were implemented across the entire bus network to streamline fare payment earlier in 1986.

In 1993, SBS introduced into service its first air-conditioned 12m double decker bus, the Leyland Olympian 3-axle. With a capacity of 131, its size earned it the nickname the “Superbus”. Three years later, TIBS phased in Singapore&#x27;s first articulated buses with a length of 17.5m and a capacity of 150.

===Late 1990s-2000s: Bus operators go multimodal===

By 1996, SBS had expanded far beyond public bus operations to include tourist transport (SBS Leisure), taxis (Citycab) and engineering works (SBS Engineering) to name a few. To better manage its business, SBS (1978) Limited was rebranded as DelGro Corporation while public bus services were now managed by a new subsidiary named SBS. This new company also won a tender in 1999 to operate the North East MRT line and the LRT systems in Sengkang and Punggol and was rebranded as SBS Transit in 2001 to reflect its multimodal nature. By 2003, Delgro Corporation merged with Comfort Group to form ComfortDelGro, one of the largest land transport operators in the world whose operations include Metroline in London and ComfortDelGro Australia. In 2001, TIBS was merged into SMRT Corporation and by 2004, the TIBS name was dropped by SMRT, with TIBS now being known as SMRT Buses.

During this period, there were also numerous changes outside corporate shakeups; in 1995, some bus services in Bukit Panjang, Sengkang and Punggol were transferred to TIBS from SBS but this was reversed in 1999 when SBS won the contract to operate the North East MRT line. In return, bus services in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok were transferred to TIBS that year. In 2002, the contactless EZ-Link card was introduced to replace the magnetic farecard and the first air-conditioned bus interchange opened in Toa Payoh; by the end of 2021, there were 11 air-conditioned integrated transport hubs (ITHs).

In 2006, SBS Transit introduced into service its first wheelchair accessible bus, the Volvo B9TL, on route 21 between Pasir Ris and St. Michael&#x27;s. SSB wound up in 2007 with the discontinuation of the City Shuttle Service and its fleet was inherited by SMRT Buses. By 2009, both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses were renewing their respective bus fleets with new low-entry Scania K230UB buses and Mercedes-Benz OC500LE buses respectively.

LTA took on the role of central bus network planner from 2009, working with communities and the bus operators, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses, to identify areas for bus improvements and to shift the focus to placing the commuter at the centre and taking a holistic approach in planning the bus network, taking into consideration development in the Rapid Transit System (RTS) network and other transport infrastructure. It is meant for their feedbacks, and any changes will be under the monthly updates, this has been brought through Bus Services Enhancement Programme. Under BSEP, about 80 new services are being introduced and 1000 buses are being added over five years.

Quality of Service (QoS) standards have also been tightened to reduce waiting time and reduce crowding. Now, those with increased loads run every 10 minutes or less during weekday peak hours in 2015. Feeder bus services have become more frequent too, with 95% of bus services now running at intervals of 10 minutes or less during the weekday peak periods, tightened from 85%.

It was also in the 21st century when the public bus operators looked into alternative fuel sources. In 2002, SBS purchased 12 CNG-powered Volvo B10BLE buses whereas the first hybrid buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses were introduced in 2010.
===2010s: Government leans in===

Since the early years of independence, the government has maintained its stance that heavy car usage is not sustainable for Singapore in the long term with a mixed-use of policies to both deter car usage and to push its people to take public transport. In December 2011, the North–South MRT line suffered its first major breakdowns with 127,000 passengers affected in the worst of them.

Amid growing criticism of the existing operating model and growing strain on the bus system, the main public transport statutory board Land Transport Authority (LTA) launched the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), with 80 new and extended bus routes and 1000 government-funded buses, involving Volvo B9TL (Wright Eclipse Gemini 2), Mercedes-Benz Citaro, Alexander Dennis Enviro500 and MAN A22 buses. introduced over a period of five years. In 2013, the last non-air-conditioned public bus, the Volvo Olympian 2-Axle, was phased out of service whereas SMRT Buses introduced its first wheelchair-accessible articulated bus, the MAN A24 and in the following year, its first-ever double-decker bus, the Alexander Dennis Enviro500.

In 2014, LTA announced that it would replace the existing operating model with the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) from 2016 onwards. Modelled after the Transperth model with elements of the competitive tendering model from London Buses, LTA would own all bus assets and lease them out in regional packages to different bus operators for five years. The first bus package, the Bulim Bus Package, was awarded to Anglo-Australian company Tower Transit whereas Loyang was awarded to Go-Ahead. Both companies began their operations in 2016. The entire public bus system was fully transitioned into the BCM by September 2016 with SBS Transit and SMRT signing agreements with LTA to operate the remaining packages up to 2021 to 2026 after which they would be gradually opened up to competitive tendering.

With the BCM, bus operators introduced new buses with new features; in 2016 the first fully electric bus since the withdrawal of trolleybuses, the BYD K9, was operated by Go-Ahead Singapore whereas the first buses with USB charging ports commenced service with SMRT that year. In 2017, two three-door buses — a double-deck MAN A95 and a single deck MAN A22 were trialled by Tower Transit and SMRT Buses respectively. New Volvo B5LH hybrid buses were also purchased from Volvo in 2018.

On 17 December 2018, LTA started a 6-month trial of on-demand public bus (ODPB) services. It allows commuters to request on-demand bus services within the Marina-Downtown and Joo Koon areas during off-peak hours on weekdays, and those heading from the CBD to Bedok or Tampines late-night hours. During the trial, regular bus services serving the areas specified will still be available, though at lower frequencies. However, the trials were unsuccessful and were eventually discontinued after 15 June 2019. As a result, services 400 and 402 were merged into Feeder service 400, from Shenton Way to Marina Barrage and Marina South Pier without the need to be suspended during the COVID-19 circuit breaker. Service NR7 is the first night bus service to be discontinued, others were suspended from 7 April 2020.

In April 2019, SimplyGo, a new payment scheme that allows direct fare payment from bank cards, was introduced. Stroller restraint systems were also retrofitted on all wheelchair-accessible buses since July 2019. In addition, LTA also experimented with assistive technology for commuters with special needs on routes 139 and 141 from January to July 2019.

=== 2020s: Sustainable and accessible buses ===

On 3 April 2020, 10 units of Yutong E12 electric buses debuted on SMRT Buses services 944 and 983, on Tower Transit services 66 and 990, and on Go-Ahead service 15. 

On 29 July 2020, 5 units of BYD K9 electric buses debuted on SBS Transit services 135, 162, and 807, with the rollout of the remaining 15 units completed in December 2020.

On 27 October 2020, 10 units of Yutong E12DD double-decker electric buses debuted on SMRT service 983, on Tower Transit service 189, and on Go-Ahead services 83 and 118. 

On 25 August 2021, ST Engineering-Linkker LM312 which is fitted with 3 doors debuted on SBS Transit Service 38 and 40, on SMRT Buses services 176 and 976. 

On 5 October 2021, ST Engineering Retrofitted Electric Bus, SG3100M which was once a diesel bus was retrofitted to an electric bus debuted on SMRT Buses Service 176. However, it was taken out of service the next day due to rolling back issues and charging connectivity issues. It has since returned to revenue service in August 2023 after taken out for repairs between late 2022 to August 2023.

All the Volvo Super Olympian buses were retired from revenue service on 8 April 2020, with the exception of SBS9889U being in revenue service until 11 November 2020. However, 2 buses have been preserved - 1 in Hong Kong for heritage purposes and the other in a special needs school in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore for practical purposes. A sole Mercedes-Benz O405G (Hispano Habit), TIB1238H which operated under Kranji Depot [KJDEP] has been preserved at Kranji Depot and has been deregistered with the &quot;Off Peak&quot; Number plate which has a Red Plate with White Text. November 2020 marked the last day of operation of non-wheelchair-accessible buses with TIB1242U, a Hispano Habit-bodied Mercedes-Benz O405G on Service 169 being the last non-wheelchair-accessible bus on revenue service.

On 1 December 2020, all public buses in Singapore became fully wheelchair-accessible.

In April 2023, LTA launched a tender for 400 electric buses. The tender was won by BYD and Zhongtong, for 240 and 120 buses each. An option for 60 extra buses was exercised and awarded to BYD in October 2024, and the new buses entered service from December.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged in the beginning of 2020, the Singapore government introduced the circuit breaker measures to curb the spread of the virus. Under these measures, selected public bus services were suspended in two tranches, with adjustments made later. The first tranche of suspended bus services took effect from Wednesday, 8 April 2020, while the second tranche of bus service suspensions started from Wednesday, 15 April 2020. The suspensions lasted till Monday, 1 June 2020; Express and City Direct services all resumed after 1 June 2020, and several recreational and discretionary services were suspended until 30 June 2022, after which all services except 401 were withdrawn.

Bus 401 was eventually reinstated on 4 June 2022 while the rest of the suspended bus services were withdrawn from 30 June 2022.

====Installation of protective screens====
Since 2016, protective screens were installed to protect bus drivers from potential abuse by passengers. This was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect bus captains from the virus as well.

====Autonomous buses====
Between 2015 and 2022, ST Engineering embarked on various initiatives and effort to develop and trial autonomous buses. The public trials included Sentosa (3 months, 2019), Science Park 2 (4 months, 2021) and Jurong Island (4 months, 2021). In 2023, the company discontinued their autonomous bus development effort, citing insufficient financial resources. The Centre of Excellence for Testing &amp; Research of Autonomous Vehicles (CETRAN) has said that autonomous vehicles remained a key part of the plan to make the city-state &quot;car-lite&quot;, potentially reducing accidents and keeping roads safer for all.

==== Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme ====

In July 2024, LTA announced the launch of the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme (BCEP), in which they would spend nearly $900 million over a period of eight years to improve the connectivity of public buses in Singapore. These improvements would include purchasing more buses, introducing new bus services and increasing the frequency of existing ones, recruiting more staff and building new transport infrastructure.

Under the BCEP, the main initiatives of the programme include -

* Bus Service Improvements: In response to changing travel patterns and continuing plans of bus service rationalisation in view of the expanded rail network, bus services will be improved through introduction of new bus services, modifying services or improving service frequencies. This includes service 230 extension to Caldecott, as well as the preliminary plans of extending service 116 to Buangkok, extending service 114 to Yio Chu Kang (with introduction of service 114M), amending service 197 to Kembangan and Chai Chee, discontinuation of service 196e and 853M, and extension of service 171 to Tengah.
* Peak-Hour Express Bus Services: More peak hour express bus services will be introduced. This includes two City Directs from Punggol to CBD and one from Tengah/Bukit Batok West to CBD.
* New Bus Services in New Estates: With growing demand in residential estates, the introduction of new bus services will be sped up to serve residents&#x27; needs better. Two bus services are introduced: 861 and 967; and the third one will be introduced in Tampines around 2025.
* Express Feeder Services: The new category will reduce residents travel time to major transport nodes by skipping intermediate bus stops along routes. The first express feeder service was introduced on 9 December 2024, which is 298X.

==Vehicles==
Singapore&#x27;s buses consist of single deck and double deck buses and they are operated by all four operators, SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore. Articulated buses are operated by SMRT Buses, with several units being transferred to SBS Transit and Tower Transit Singapore as part of the Seletar and Sembawang-Yishun Bus Packages respectively under the Bus Contracting Model (BCM).

==Routes==

Singapore has many different bus services plying through the island. These bus routes are categorised accordingly:
* Trunk: Routes that ply between various towns. (e.g. 5, 12, 27, 100, 133, 162, 857, 960)
* Feeder: Services that operate within a single town (e.g. 243G, 334, 386, 410W, 807, 901M, 945) or in a dual-loop fashion (e.g. 222, 291, 293, 811, 912)
* Express Feeder: Feeder services that skips lower demand bus stops for quicker travels (i.e. 298X)
* Short Trip: Routes that operate short haul trips of services which cover high demand sectors of the parent route. (e.g. 3A, 70B, 147A, 222A, 857A, 965A)
* Jurong Industrial Services: Routes that serve the Jurong and Tuas industrial areas, served by SMRT Buses under the Jurong West Bus Package. (e.g. 247, 249, 251, 258)
* Express: Routes that stop at selected stops and generally run on expressways or long stretches of express sector for faster travel between several towns. (e.g. 43e, 174e, 502/502A, 854e, 951E)
* City Direct: Service connecting passengers directly to and from the Central Business District during peak hours. Previously operated by private operators. (i.e. 651 to 678; 660M)
* Cross Border Services: Services that cross the Causeway or the Second Link into Malaysia. As the public will use passport or QR-code scanning; bus drivers will scan the bus pass for verification without the need of passports or QR code scanning, as the ICA will have their own database at the bus depot (e.g. Ulu Pandan and Woodlands Bus Depot), and Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange is sterile area for bus drivers. (i.e. 160, 170, 170X, 950)
* Resorts World Sentosa Bus services: Bus services that operate in and out of Resorts World Sentosa. Services run on weekends and Public Holidays. (i.e. RWS8)
* Scheme B Bus services: Bus services that are operated by private operators at peak timings. (Note that these services are not very well mentioned by LTA) (i.e. 621, 625, 640)

=== Bus packages ===

Under the Bus Contracting Model, bus services are grouped into bus packages, each of which is operated by a bus operator.

<text>Leonard Weir (born 1928 in Preston, Melbourne, Victoria) is an Australian lyric tenor best known for his performances in stage musicals in the United Kingdom, particularly in the role of Freddy Eynsford-Hill in the original London production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; along with Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison. He replaced John Michael King who played Freddy in the original Broadway production of the play.

Weir made a cameo appearance in the 1959 Sid James comedy film, &quot;Make Mine a Million.&quot; He appeared on UK television on &quot;Jack Hylton&#x27;s Monday Show&quot; in 1958. From 1969-1970 he made several appearances in Australian television on GTV-9&#x27;s popular variety show, &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;.

Weir was a finalist in the 1952 Sun Aria competition.

Weir married Beverley Clare on 23 April 1953 at Scots Church, Collins Street, Melbourne. The couple met when Weir was engaged to sing at her sister&#x27;s wedding. In 1954 they went to London where he studied with the Italian tenor Dino Borgioli for four years while working as a clerk at Australia House. Beverly also studied with Borgioli and obtained singing engagements in England. Weir joined the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company for its production of The Merry Widow (starring fellow Australian June Bronhill).

They returned to Australia in 1964.

Weir has two children. His son, Nick Weir, was the host of several game-shows, before becoming a cruise ship entertainment manager.

<doc id="1159450" wikidata="Q1188949" url="?curid=1159450" title="Public Services International">
<text>Public Services International (PSI) is the global union federation for workers in public services, including those who work in social services, health care, municipal services, central government and public utilities. , PSI has 700 affiliated trade unions from 154 countries representing over 30 million workers.

==History==
In March 1907, the executive of the German Union of Municipal and State Workers, based in Berlin, issued a call to &quot;workers employed in municipal and state undertakings, in power stations, in gas and waterworks, in all countries&quot; to attend an international conference in August 1907, in Stuttgart. Four Danes, two Dutchmen, eight Germans, a Hungarian, a Swede, and a Swiss met in the Stuttgart trade union building for the First Congress of Public Services International, representing 44,479 workers, and they founded the International Secretariat of the Workers in Public Services. This grew rapidly, and by 1913 represented more than 100,000 workers, enabling a part-time salary to be paid to the secretary, based in Berlin.

The federation ceased to operate during the First World War, but was reactivated in 1919, now based in Amsterdam. In 1925, it renamed itself as the International Federation of Employees in Public Services, while in 1935 it absorbed the International Federation of Civil Servants, becoming the International Federation of Employees in Public and Civil Services. The headquarters moved back to Berlin in 1929, then to Amsterdam in 1933, and on to Paris. This closed in 1940, and the occupying Nazi forces destroyed the federation&#x27;s property, but in 1945 the federation was relaunched at a meeting of the executive committee, held in London. The following year, it became known as the International Federation of Unions of Employees in Public and Civil Services, then in 1958 it shortened its name to become the &quot;Public Services International&quot;.

==Policies==

PSI is involved in the movement against privatization of public services by corporations across the world. PSI also works against tax evasion by multinational corporations and is a founding member of the International Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation. PSI&#x27;s pro-worker stance has put it at odds with the WTO, World Bank, and IMF who predominantly promote market solutions.

PSI works in partnership with affiliate trade unions, other global union federations and NGOs such as the Our World Is Not For Sale Network.

== Public Services International Research Unit ==
Financed by PSI, Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) researches the privatization and restructuring of public services around the world, with special focus on water, energy, waste management, and healthcare. Established in 2000, it is part of the Business School of the University of Greenwich, UK.

<text>Conspiracy is a 2001 made-for-television drama film that dramatises the 1942 Wannsee Conference. Using the authentic script taken from the only surviving transcript recorded during the meeting, the film delves into the psychology of Nazi officials involved in the &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish question&quot; during World War II.

The film was written by Loring Mandel and directed by Frank Pierson. Its ensemble cast includes Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci, Colin Firth and David Threlfall. Branagh won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor, and Tucci was awarded a Golden Globe Award for his supporting role.

==Plot==
On 20 January 1942, Nazi German officials hold a conference at a villa in Wannsee, a wealthy district on the outskirts of Berlin, to determine the method by which they will make Germany&#x27;s territory free of Jews, including the occupied countries of Poland, Reichskommissariat Ostland, Czechoslovakia and France.

Chairing the meeting is Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Security Main Office, who states he has been given a mandate in the form of a directive from Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to achieve a &quot;complete solution of the Jewish question.&quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger responds that the meeting is pointless and that the Jewish question has already been settled. Heydrich announces that the government&#x27;s policy will change from emigration to &quot;evacuation&quot;, and Fascist Italy will be forced to cooperate. There is consternation over the use of euphemisms from several of the participants, and Heydrich
insinuates a policy of genocide that will become more explicit as the meeting progresses.

The men discuss sterilisation and exemptions for mixed-race Jews who have one or more non-Jewish grandparents. Heydrich&#x27;s willingness to entertain various competing ideas suggests the ultimate fate of the Jews has not been decided. As the discussion continues, however, it becomes evident to the participants that the purpose of the meeting is not to formulate policy but to receive direction from the SS. Heydrich calls a break in the proceedings, and after praising Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, a lawyer in the Reich Ministry for the Interior, takes Stuckart aside to warn him about the consequences of his stubbornness. On reconvening, Heydrich reveals in frank detail the policy that had already been decided before the meeting convened: the wholesale extermination of Europe&#x27;s Jewish population using gas chambers and ovens to incinerate the bodies.

SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann then reveals that the SS has been building extermination camps at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka, and making preparations for the &quot;Final Solution&quot; under the noses of Germany&#x27;s civilian bureaucrats. Eichmann describes the method that will be used: asphyxiation of Jews in gas chambers built at locations such as Auschwitz.

Throughout the meeting and over refreshments attendees raise other side issues, reflecting the interests of their respective work areas, including concerns that cholera and typhus could break out from the overpopulated ghettos in Poland. A break is called and this time it is Kritzinger&#x27;s turn to be taken aside and intimidated by Heydrich. Kritzinger realizes that any hopes he had of assuring livable conditions for the Jewish population are unrealistic. In return, he tells Heydrich a cautionary tale about a man consumed by hatred of his father, so much so that his life loses its meaning once his father dies. Heydrich later interprets this as a warning that a similar fate awaits them after the Jews are exterminated, though he rejects the warning, telling Müller and Eichmann that he will not miss the Jews.

Heydrich then recalls and concludes the meeting. He also asks for explicit assent and support from each official, one by one. After giving careful instructions on the secrecy of the minutes and notes of the meeting, they adjourn and begin to depart.

As the officials depart, a brief account of the fate of each one is given. Most of the members either died during the war or were arrested immediately after; two, Josef Bühler and Karl Eberhard Schongarth, are convicted by Allied military tribunals and executed, and the others acquitted to live a peaceful life in postwar West Germany. Heydrich would be assassinated by Czechoslovak partisans for his brutal rule in Bohemia and Moravia within six months, while Eichmann would flee to Buenos Aires but be captured, tried and sentenced to death by Israel in the 1960s. The film ends with the house tidied up and all records of the meeting destroyed as if it had never happened. The final card before the credits reveals that Luther&#x27;s copy of the Wannsee minutes, recovered by the US Army in the archives of the German Foreign Office in 1947, was the only record of the conference to survive.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
Colin Callendar, head of HBO NYC productions, identifies two primary historical arguments underpinning the narrative. He underscores the conference&#x27;s role as a mechanism for consolidating Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s authority and that of the SS in executing the infamous &quot;Final Solution.&quot; He also emphasizes the film&#x27;s portrayal of a lack of a clearly defined and centralized policy preceding the Wannsee Conference. These insights reflect a functionalist interpretation of the Holocaust, highlighting the evolutionary and radicalizing nature of the genocide, often originating from lower ranks within the Nazi hierarchy. Callendar also notes the presence of distinct groups of various ranking officials (and their conflict objectives) which underscores the Holocaust&#x27;s emergence as a result of competing interests among different governmental agencies.

In addition to Callendar, the producers had the input of three historians, including Michael Berenbaum of the United States Holocaust Museum and Andrea Axelrod as a historical advisor. Noted Holocaust historian Christopher Browning also acted as a consultant. Browning offered small critiques, including geographical mistakes, references to speeches and events that had not yet happened in January 1942 and how the German officials referred to each other. Axelrod provided extensive research and documentation (amounting to 170 citations), including verifying the amount of snowfall in Wannsee on the date of the conference.

=== Screenplay ===
Pierson brought Mandel into the project initially for an unproduced script entitled &quot;Complicity.&quot; This was intended to be a companion movie detailing the failure of the Allies to help with Jewish refugees. The piece never made it to the screen, most likely as a result of the sensitive subject of culpability of Western Allies.

Mandel utilized the only existing copy of the conference minutes, called the &quot;Wansee Protocols&quot;, found in 1947 in the German Foreign Office files as the basis for the script. During an interview discussing a later adaptation of the screenplay into a theatre production, the author noted &quot;I had never heard of the Wansee Conference&quot; and that Pierson told him &quot;...it was the first thing he had encountered about the Holocaust that angered him rather than making him want to cry&quot;, he signed on to write the screenplay. The script is not verbatim from conversations at the conference and most of the actual dialogue is invented. The meeting occurred over a period of 90 minutes, which is the same running time of the movie.

=== Filming ===
Kenneth Branagh, the actor portraying Heydrich in the film, reported that he found the role deeply unsettling. Despite grappling with a profound aversion towards the historical figure he portrayed, Branagh is acclaimed for delivering a remarkable portrayal of the allegedly flamboyant officer. Branagh&#x27;s portrayal was challenging not only by the difficulty of delivering lines but also by the absence of discernible motivations or upbringing factors explaining Heydrich&#x27;s chilling readiness to perpetrate genocide on an unprecedented scale. Branagh reaffirmed a recurring theme of the film, emphasizing its commitment to historical accuracy over sensationalism or star power, underscoring the importance of authentically recounting this harrowing chapter of history.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Conspiracy&quot; has a 100% approval rating from 7 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

In The American Historical Review, Alan E. Steinweis critically analyzes the film, offering insights from a historian&#x27;s perspective. Steinweis highlights instances within the film where certain scenes are identified as dramatic inventions, pointing out discrepancies between historical accuracy and cinematic portrayal. However, Steinweis underscores a common limitation in historians&#x27; critiques of films, noting their tendency to focus solely on specific fictionalized elements while overlooking broader thematic arguments and the overarching vision of the film.

Steinweis also juxtaposes &quot;Conspiracy&quot; with its 1984 German predecessor, &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot;, suggesting that the earlier film may offer a more historically accurate depiction by providing a more detailed examination of the killing process. He critiques the portrayal of Reinhard Heydrich in &quot;Conspiracy&quot; while commending the depiction of Adolf Eichmann as &quot;refreshing.&quot; Yet, Steinweis argues that a deeper analysis, often absent in historical reviews of films, would involve an exploration of the film&#x27;s production history to uncover the filmmakers&#x27; intentions, historical arguments, and research methodologies underlying the film&#x27;s creation.

James Rampton in &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the film: 

An impressed Austin Film Society had a lengthy review of the film and details about its making.

<doc id="1159456" wikidata="Q5634797" url="?curid=1159456" title="HMS Valiant (1863)">
<text>HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; was the second ship of the armoured frigates ordered by the Royal Navy in 1861. Her builders went bankrupt shortly after she was laid down, which significantly delayed her completion. After being launched in 1863, she waited a further five years to receive her guns due to supply issues. Upon being commissioned in 1868 the ship was assigned as the First Reserve guard ship for Southern Ireland, where she remained until she was decommissioned in 1885. &quot;Valiant&quot; was hulked in 1897 as part of the stoker training school HMS &quot;Indus&quot; before becoming a storeship for kite balloons during the First World War. The ship was converted to a floating oil tank in 1926 and served in that role until sold for scrap in 1956.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Hector&quot;-class ironclads, like their immediate predecessors, the , were designed as smaller and cheaper versions of the armoured frigates. They were modified versions of the &quot;Defence&quot;-class ships with additional armour and more powerful engines.

&quot;Valiant&quot; was long between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship was overweight and displaced . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms. The ships of her class were designed with a very low centre of gravity and had a metacentric height of . While handy in manoeuvring, they rolled quite badly.

===Propulsion===

&quot;Valiant&quot; had one 2-cylinder horizontal-return connecting-rod steam engine made by Maudslay Sons &amp; Field driving a single propeller. Six boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engine produced a total of . During her sea trials on 18 September 1865 &quot;Valiant&quot; had a maximum speed of . The ship carried of coal, enough to steam at full speed.

The ship was barque-rigged and had a sail area of . Her funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone. She was designed to allow the ship&#x27;s propeller to be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail, but the hoisting gear was never fitted.

===Armament===
The armament of the &quot;Hector&quot;-class ships was intended to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to eight rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns and twenty-four 68-pounders. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–1864 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.

Due to her extended construction time, &quot;Valiant&quot; never received the breech loaders, and was armed with sixteen and two rifled muzzle-loading guns. The two 8-inch guns were mounted on the quarterdeck where they could be fought in all weathers and four 7-inch guns were also fitted on the upper deck. The remaining twelve 7-inch guns were carried on the main deck. The shell of the 15-calibre 8-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate armour.

===Armour===
The &quot;Hector&quot;-class ships had a wrought-iron waterline armour belt, thick, that covered amidships and left the bow and stern unprotected. To protect against raking fire the belt was closed off by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads at each end at lower deck level. The armour extended to below the waterline. The main deck was protected by a strake of armour that ran the full length of the ship. Amidships, it was 4.5-inch thick for a length of 216 feet and tapered to a thickness of to the ends of the ship. The armour was backed by of teak. The lack of armour at the stern meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable.

==Service history==
HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; was laid down on 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town. This company went bankrupt in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames Ironworks, which delayed the ship&#x27;s launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after &quot;Valiant&quot; had been towed to Portsmouth for fitting out, the ship was inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy. Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles was slow and ships already in commission had priority so &quot;Valiant&quot; was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five years after she was launched.

After &quot;Valiant&quot; was commissioned she became the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland, where she remained until 1885, an experience unique among the British ironclads, although she did have one break to have new boilers installed. From June to August 1878 the ship formed part of the Particular Service Squadron at the time of the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, and sailed up the Dardanelles under the command of Admiral Hornby. On 20 July 1884 &quot;Valiant&quot; was accidentally rammed by the ironclad in Lough Swilly, damaging her hull and tearing off her boats, davits and fittings on one side of the ship. &quot;Valiant&quot; was paid off in 1885, and saw no further front-line service; lying for thirteen years in a partially dismantled state at Devonport. In 1897 she was assigned to the stoker training establishment , briefly losing her name, before being renamed as &quot;Indus IV&quot; in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS &quot;Valiant III&quot;. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so that she was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze, where she remained until 1956. &quot;Valiant&quot; was sold in that year to Belgian ship breakers and towed to Bruges on 8 December 1956.

<doc id="1159465" wikidata="Q7489" url="?curid=1159465" title="Emperor Gaozong of Song">
<text>Emperor Gaozong of Song (12 June 11079 November 1187), personal name Zhao Gou, courtesy name Deji, was the tenth emperor of the Chinese Song dynasty and the first of the Southern Song dynasty, ruling between 1127 and 1162 and retaining power as retired emperor from 1162 until his death in 1187. The ninth son of Emperor Huizong and a younger half-brother of Emperor Qinzong, Zhao Gou was not present in the capital of Bianjing (the modern day Kaifeng) when it fell to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in 1127 during the beginning of the Jin-Song Wars. Narrowly avoiding capture by Jin forces, he escaped first to Yangzhou and then Lin&#x27;an (the modern day Hangzhou), assuming the throne and re-establishing the Song court. Despite initial setbacks, including Jin invasions and a brief deposition in 1129, Emperor Gaozong consolidated his political position and presided over the continued military conflict with Jin. Prior to 1141, military commanders including Han Shizhong and Yue Fei reconquered portions of the Central Plains while chancellors like Lü Yihao, Zhao Ding, Zhang Jun, and Qin Hui managed the civil bureaucracy.

In 1141, Gaozong collaborated with Qin to pursue a peace settlement with Jin. Although the resulting Treaty of Shaoxing ceded the Central Plains and formally established Song as a Jin tributary, it ensured two decades of uninterrupted peace, allowing the Southern Song state to achieve internal stability and open a lucrative trade with Jin. Furthermore, it served to preclude the return of Emperor Qinzong, who remained in captivity in Jin and whose release could have jeopardized Gaozong&#x27;s claim to the throne. Gaozong and Qin then secured court control over the military, forcing Han Shizhong and the general Zhang Jun into retirement and executing Yue Fei on trumped-up charges. Despite his successes as emperor, Gaozong&#x27;s treatment of Yue, who was remembered as a culture hero, and his surrender of over half of Song China to the enemy, marred his reputation in both traditional historiography and popular memory. Gaozong, along his father and half-brother, were blamed for the Song dynasty&#x27;s decline.

Gaozong&#x27;s only biological son, Zhao Fu, died in childhood. In 1160, he adopted his distant relative Zhao Yuan and elevated him to crown prince in 1162, shortly before abdicating in his favor. Despite his abdication, Gaozong retained &quot;de facto&quot; control of state affairs as retired emperor, continuing to oversee the dynasty until dying of natural causes in 1187, at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Emperor Gaozong was the ninth son of Emperor Huizong and a younger half-brother of Emperor Qinzong. His mother, whose maiden family name was Wei (), was a concubine of Huizong. She was honoured as Empress Xianren (顯仁皇后; 1080–1159) after his ascension to the throne.

Emperor Gaozong was originally a prince named Zhao Gou during the reigns of his father and brother. After Huizong abdicated, his older brother Qinzong became emperor. During this time, the capital of Bianjing was under siege by the Jurchens. He was ordered to the Jurchen camp to negotiate peace by Qinzong in an effort to end the siege early but Zhao Gou was held for ransom. He later came back after being ransomed due to the Jurchens&#x27; doubts of his identity. After his half-brother and father and the capital were captured by forces of the Jurchen-led Jin Empire in the Jingkang Incident in 1127 along with majority of the imperial clan members due to his predecessors&#x27; incompetence and the imperial court&#x27;s corruption, he escaped to Southern China due to being in Cizhou for a diplomatic mission and therefore, not in Bianjing. In order to escape, Zhao Gou had to move province to province in order to escape the Jin troops. The Jurchens tried to lure him back to Bianjing where they could finally capture him, but did not succeed. Zhao Gou finally arrived in the Song Southern Capital at Jiankang, the first of many temporary capitals.

== Reign ==

=== Enthronement ===

After proving himself to be a more competent administrator than his predecessors, he won support from imperial court&#x27;s remnants of his ascension to the throne; he reestablished the Song Empire (historically known as the Southern Song dynasty) and was proclaimed as Emperor Gaozong with the era name Jianyan in Jiankang (present Nanjing) which at the time was a temporary residence for the remnants of the Song. The new reign name Jianyan 建炎, literally meaning &quot;Establishing the Fire,&quot; suggests the Southern Song&#x27;s continuation to the Northern Song (Fire was the dynastic element of the Song as decided in the early years of the dynasty). He would later move to Yingtianfu (; modern Shangqiu) due to the historical significance to Emperor Taizu of Song.

From 1127 to 1129, the Song sent thirteen embassies to the Jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of Gaozong&#x27;s mother and Huizong, but the Jin court ignored them. The Da Chu, a puppet state established by the Jin Empire, was abolished in 1127 when Zhang Bangchang and the regent of Da Chu, the former Empress Meng, submitted to Emperor Gaozong, who then ordered Zhang&#x27;s execution under pressure from Li Gang.

Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s early reign was filled with Jurchen raids and attacks on his realm. This can be traced to Zhang&#x27;s execution and the submission of Da Chu to Song, which ultimately caused the Jin to renew their attacks and quickly conquer Northern China. Initially, he employed military leaders such as Li Gang, Zong Ze, Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Yu Yunwen to lead the Song forces to hold off the Jurchens, as well as to improve his public image through his declaration to restore the Song Empire to its former glory. However, when one of Li Gang&#x27;s guerrilla forces, the Red Scarf Army, scored a major victory against the Jin troops and almost captured their commander-in-chief, the emperor dismissed the minister on a trumped-up charge, implying that he did not want to win this battle, because if Song won, Emperor Qinzong might be restored.

Owing to the vulnerability of Yingtianfu, Emperor Gaozong moved to Yangzhou in late 1127 or early 1128. However, Yangzhou proved to be no safe haven for the Song either, as barely a year later the Jurchens advanced to the point where they were threatening to capture Yangzhou. When the Jurchens advanced to the Huai River, the court was partially evacuated to Lin&#x27;an (modern Hangzhou) in 1129. Days later, Gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback, just a few hours ahead of Jurchen vanguard troops.

=== Mutiny and first abdication ===

On March 26, 1129, Gaozong lost his throne to a mutiny that was instigated by the palace guards led by Miao Fu () and Liu Zhengyan (). They were unsatisfied with Gaozong&#x27;s decision to appoint their adversary Wang Yuan to an important imperial post hence would outrank them. Banding together with at least ten thousand palace guards under the pretense that Wang and the court eunuchs were plotting, Miao and Liu mutinied and murdered Wang. They then forced Gaozong to abdicate in favor of his two-year-old son, Zhao Fu. The plot came to an abrupt end less than a month later on April 20, 1129, when Miao and Liu were defeated by Gaozong&#x27;s loyal army, led by Han Shizhong, and were both executed for treason. Gaozong&#x27;s son later died from illness after an unofficial reign of three months. After being restored to the throne, Gaozong himself was pursued by Jin forces and was not in full control of southern China until the late 1130s. The mutiny would cause Emperor Gaozong to move his capital to Jiankang.

In 1130, Wuzhu, a Jurchen general, crossed the Yangtze southwest of Jiankang and then captured the city. Wuzhu set out from Jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture Gaozong. The Jin seized Hangzhou on January 22 and then Shaoxing further south on February 4 where Emperor Gaozong was almost captured by Wuzhu at Mingzhou near Lin&#x27;an but Zhang Jun, another general who briefly halted the Jin advance, giving Emperor Gaozong the chance to flee the city by ship. Soon, the Jurchens gave up the pursuit and retreated north. After they plundered the undefended cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou, they finally started to face resistance from Song armies led by Yue Fei and Han Shizhong.

In 1130, during the Battle of Huangtiandang, when fleeing to the south, he had the newly appointed commander-in-chief, Yue Fei, who was only 27 years old at the time, to help with the defense, and Yue scored a major victory against the Jin armies neared Nanjing. After the Song forces defeated the Jin, they stayed north of the Yangzi River, and Emperor Gaozong declared the city of Lin&#x27;an as the dynasty&#x27;s new temporary capital, replacing Kaifeng in 1133.

Having no surviving sons of his own, he adopted two boys in 1133: one of them became the foster son of the future Empress Wu in 1140, and the other one in 1142.

=== Invasion of Da Qi ===
Reluctant to let the war drag on, the Jin decided to create Da Qi (the &quot;Great Qi&quot;) in 1130, their second attempt at a puppet state in Northern China. The Jurchens believed that this state, nominally ruled by someone of Han Chinese descent, would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency. The Jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower, and controlling the entirety of northern China was not administratively feasible. In the final months of 1129, Liu Yu (; 1073–1143) won the favor of the Jin Emperor Taizong. Da Qi had more autonomy than the previous Da Chu although Liu Yu was obligated to obey the orders of the Jurchen generals. With Jin support, Da Qi invaded the Song in November 1133. Li Cheng, a Song turncoat who had joined the Qi, led the campaign. They initially had success as Xiangyang and nearby prefectures fell to his army. The capture of Xiangyang on the Han River gave the Jurchens a passage into the central valley of the Yangtze River. However, their southward push was halted by the general Yue Fei. In 1134, Yue Fei defeated Li and retook Xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures. But later that year, Qi and Jin initiated a new offensive further east along the Huai River. For the first time, Emperor Gaozong issued an edict officially condemning Da Qi. The armies of Qi and Jin won a series of victories in the Huai Valley, but were repelled by Han Shizhong near Yangzhou and by Yue Fei at Luzhou (, modern Hefei). In 1135, the Jin Emperor Taizong died. This caused the Da Qi to suddenly withdraw, giving the Song time to regroup. The Da Qi lost a battle at Outang (), in modern Anhui, against a Song army led by Yang Qizhong (). The victory boosted Song morale, and the military commissioner Zhang Jun convinced Emperor Gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack. Emperor Gaozong initially agreed, but he quickly abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named Li Qiong () killed his superior official and defected to the Jin with tens of thousands of soldiers.

=== Steps towards Peace ===

Meanwhile, Emperor Xizong inherited the Jin throne from Taizong, and pushed for peace. He and his generals were disappointed with Liu Yu&#x27;s military failures and believed that Liu was secretly conspiring with Yue Fei. These conditions caused the Jin to officially abolish Da Qi in late 1137 and the Jin and Song began negotiations towards peace.

When Emperor Gaozong was eventually told of the death of Huizong and Empress Zheng in 1137, he reportedly reacted quite severely, ordering an extended period of mourning.

In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Lin&#x27;an the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Despite this, Lin&#x27;an would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.

Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations.

=== Treaty of Shaoxing ===
After years of fighting and significant military success, Emperor Gaozong settled on a pacifist stance. One of the major reasons behind this was that Emperor Gaozong and the chancellor Qin Hui did not want the Song army to defeat the Jurchens and destroy the Jin Dynasty, as this might result in Gaozong&#x27;s half-brother - the last emperor of the Northern Song Dynasty, Emperor Qinzong, who was living in Jin-imposed exile in Manchuria - being recalled to the throne. If this happened, Gaozong would lose power. At the time, Yue Fei and Han Shizhong were preparing to attack Kaifeng and recapture it. Fearing that a victory at Kaifeng might cause the Jurchens to release Emperor Qinzong, Emperor Gaozong followed their advice, sending 12 orders back in the form of 12 gold plaques to Yue Fei, recalling him to the capital. There, Yue Fei said, in tears, &quot;Thirty years of effort now is wasted.&quot; Emperor Gaozong also recalled every soldier under threats to kill their families. After Yue Fei&#x27;s return to the capital, Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui imprisoned him on a trumped-up charge under &quot;groundless&quot; () and had him put to death. Han Shizhong was also dismissed from his military duties. On October 11, 1142, the Song and Jin empires signed the Treaty of Shaoxing, which recognised the Jurchens&#x27; claims to the former Song territories they had already conquered. This meant that Emperor Gaozong had to give up all land north of the Huai River, in exchange for peace between the two empires. Aside from two incidents, this peace would last for seventy years. The Song also had to pay a yearly tribute of 250,000 taels of silver and 250,000 packs of silk to the Jin.

The negotiation allowed the emperor&#x27;s mother and other selected members of the imperial clan (including a woman claimed to be his half-sister Princess Roufu (Zhao Duofu), whom he later sentenced to death under suspicion of impersonating an imperial princess) to return to Song; Empress Wei was then named Empress Dowager in Southern Song. However, the treaty designated the Song as the &quot;insignificant state&quot;, while the Jin was recognized as the &quot;superior state&quot;. People would later blame the emperor for Yue Fei&#x27;s death and vilify him as a hypocritical tyrant who sought to solidify power at the expense of greater danger to Song. However, although the treaty&#x27;s terms resulted in Song becoming a vassal state to the Jin, it saved Song&#x27;s economy: since the dynasty&#x27;s founding, the regime had lost more capital on military defenses than on annual payments to their neighbors, about three-quarters of state revenue. Thus, even if Gaozong wanted to recover the lost territories, he could not afford it financially; the cost of rebuilding the Song&#x27;s northern territories would have risked bankrupting the south. In addition, with the southern part of China remaining under Song control, the transport of goods became more cost-effective by boat via the streams and camels criss-crossing the region. It also eliminated obstacles to trades, allowing traders to import goods between Song and Jin territories. Qin Hui, in a reply to Gaozong&#x27;s gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations, told the emperor that &quot;the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty&#x27;s. Your servant only carried it out; what achievement was there in this for me?&quot;

Emperor Gaozong was also a notable poet and had significant influence on other Chinese poets. Among his surviving works is the &quot;Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain&quot;.

In 1161, the ruler of the Jin Dynasty, Wanyan Liang, wishing to unify China under his regime, declared war on the Song in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi. The Jin lost the war. An important consequence of this was to remove Song&#x27;s status as a vassal state, although it still had to pay tribute. Wanyan Liang was assassinated shortly afterwards, when many Jin officers rebelled as a result of the Jin defeat.

===Economy under Emperor Gaozong===
In the Shaoxing period, Emperor Gaozong told his ministers that expanding court land is similar to buying private land, questioning its value if it brings no benefits. During his reign, the government&#x27;s economic role grew, with fiscal policy aiding political functions and regulating social economic activity.

During the early Shaoxing period of Emperor Gaozong, Hu Meng, Deputy Director of the Bureau of General Accounts, requested the court to issue an edict to promote tax collectors who exceeded their targets to raise military funds. The period also created the &quot;zongzhi tax&quot; which combined twenty taxes along with the continuance of Xuanhe period taxes by officials. These increases of taxes further funded the military.

== As Retired Emperor ==
In 1162, after reigning for more than 35 years, Emperor Gaozong abdicated. Because his only son, Zhao Fu, had died of illness around the age of two, Emperor Gaozong passed the throne to his adopted son and distant cousin Zhao Shen, who then became Emperor Xiaozong. Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s handling of the Battle of Caishi with Wanyan Liang may also have contributed to his decision to retire. In retirement he assumed the title of &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (&quot;Retired Emperor&quot;) and retained some power until his death in 1187.

His death saddened Emperor Xiaozong and caused him to abdicate only two years after Gaozong&#x27;s death.

===Sister Song&#x27;s Fish Soup===

In 1180, Gaozong, when cruising on the West Lake, came across an elderly woman known as Fifth Sister Song, who escaped to Hangzhou after the Jurchens occupied the former capital and made her living by running a diner near the lake. After Gaozong tried one bowl from her, he offered her gold and silk after enjoying it. This event made her soup dish famous in the Southern Song capital; it then named Sister Song&#x27;s Fish Soup (宋嫂魚羹) and she became a wealthy culinarian. It remains a traditional dish in the Zhejiang cuisine.

<doc id="1159482" wikidata="Q964141" url="?curid=1159482" title="Revenge (Eurythmics album)">
<text>Revenge is the fifth studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 29 June 1986 by RCA Records in the United Kingdom and on 14 July in the United States. Following on from their previous album, &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; continued further in this direction as the duo embraced a more &quot;rock band&quot; style. The album spawned four singles and was a commercial success. The fourth and final single, &quot;Missionary Man&quot;, won the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Its release was supported by an extensive world tour. A 1987 concert from the Australian leg of the tour was also released on home video as &quot;Eurythmics Live&quot;.

On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG released remastered versions of each of Eurythmics&#x27; eight studio albums, containing bonus tracks and remixes. The bonus track &quot;Revenge 2&quot; is a radically different remake of &quot;Revenge&quot;, the closing track of the duo&#x27;s 1981 debut album &quot;In the Garden&quot;. A line from the song (&quot;She said revenge can be so sweet&quot;) is also heard at the end of &quot;A Little of You&quot;.

<doc id="1159483" wikidata="Q5633406" url="?curid=1159483" title="HMS Minotaur (1863)">
<text>HMS &quot;Minotaur&quot; was the lead ship of the armoured frigates built for the Royal Navy during the 1860s. &quot;Minotaur&quot; took nearly four years between her launching and commissioning because she was used for evaluations of her armament and different sailing rigs.

The ship spent the bulk of her active career as flagship of the Channel Squadron, including during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. She became a training ship in 1893 and was then hulked in 1905 when she became part of the training school at Harwich. &quot;Minotaur&quot; was renamed several times before being sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class armoured frigates were essentially enlarged versions of the ironclad with heavier armament, armour, and more powerful engines. They retained the broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor, but their sides were fully armoured to protect the 50 guns they were designed to carry. Each was equipped with a plough-shaped ram that was also more prominent than that of &quot;Achilles&quot;.

The &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The ships displaced . The hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.

&quot;Minotaur&quot; was considered &quot;an excellent sea-boat and a steady gun platform, but unhandy under steam and practically unmanageable under sail&quot; as built. Steam-powered steering improved her manoeuvring qualities significantly when it was installed in 1875 and she was judged &quot;one of our very best manoeuvrers we have in the Navy&quot; by Vice Admiral Philip Colomb in 1890. The ship&#x27;s steadiness was partially a result of her metacentric height of .

===Propulsion===
&quot;Minotaur&quot; had a two-cylinder trunk steam engine, made by John Penn and Sons, that drove a single propeller. Ten rectangular fire-tube boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engine produced a total of during the ship&#x27;s sea trials on 10 May 1867 and &quot;Minotaur&quot; had a maximum speed of . The ships carried of coal, enough to steam at . &quot;Minotaur&quot; was reboilered in 1893 and reached with .

The ship had five masts and a sail area of . Because her propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag, &quot;Minotaur&quot; only made under sail. Both funnels were semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail. Admiral George A. Ballard described &quot;Minotaur&quot; and her sisters as &quot;the dullest performers under canvas of the whole masted fleet of their day, and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose.&quot; In 1893–4, after her withdrawal from active service, &quot;Minotaur&quot; had two masts removed and was re-rigged as a barque.

===Armament===

The armament of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships was intended to be 40 rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns on the main deck and 10 more on the upper deck on pivot mounts. The gun was a new design from Armstrong, but proved a failure a few years after its introduction. The gun was withdrawn before any were received by any of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships. They were armed, instead, with a mix of and rifled muzzle-loading guns. All four nine-inch and 20 seven-inch guns were mounted on the main deck while four seven-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns. The ship also received eight brass howitzers for use as saluting guns. The gun ports were wide which allowed each gun to fire 30° fore and aft of the beam.

The shell of the 14-calibre 9-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the ability to penetrate armour.

&quot;Minotaur&quot; was rearmed in 1875 with a uniform armament of 17 nine-inch guns, 14 on the main deck, two forward chase guns and one rear chase gun. The gun ports had to be enlarged to accommodate the larger guns by hand, at a cost of £250 each. About 1883 two breech-loading guns replaced two 9-inch muzzle-loading guns. Four quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120-mm) guns, eight QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, eight machine guns and two torpedo tubes were installed in 1891–2.

===Armour===

The entire side of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships was protected by wrought iron armour that tapered from at the ends to amidships, except for a section of the bow between the upper and main decks. The armour extended below the waterline. A single 5.5-inch transverse bulkhead protected the forward chase guns on the upper deck. The armour was backed by of teak.

==Construction and service==
HMS &quot;Minotaur&quot; was originally ordered on 2 September 1861 as HMS &quot;Elephant&quot;, in honour of the ship once commanded by Nelson seventy years before, but her name was changed to &quot;Minotaur&quot; during construction. She was laid down on 12 September 1861 by the Thames Ironworks in Blackwall, London. She was launched on 12 December 1863, commissioned in April 1867 and completed on 1 June 1867. The lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details, and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig. The ship cost a total of £478,855.

&quot;Minotaur&quot; finally commissioned in Portsmouth as the flagship of the Channel Squadron, a position which she retained until 1873. In 1872 the ship nearly rammed the ironclad as they were leaving Belfast Lough. &quot;Minotaur&quot; lost her bowsprit and fore topgallant mast, but &quot;Bellerophon&quot; only suffered some minor flooding. She paid off for a long refit in 1873 and resumed her position in 1875 when she rejoined the Channel Squadron. &quot;Minotaur&quot; became the first ship in the Royal Navy to receive a permanent installation of an electric searchlight in 1876.

In 1882, she took part in naval operations off Egypt during the British invasion of the country, arriving in Alexandria just after the British squadron there had bombarded the port&#x27;s defences on 11 July. She remained on active service off Egypt, sometimes shelling shore positions, until October 1882 when she sailed for Malta.

On 24 December 1886, she collided with in the Tagus, severely damaging HMS &quot;Monarch&quot;.

On 28 February 1887, she rescued the passengers and crew of the British steamship , which was wrecked on a reef off Vigo, Spain. The ship was the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir William Hewett, who had earned the Victoria Cross in the siege of Sevastopol in 1854, during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fleet Review on 23 July 1887. &quot;Minotaur&quot; was paid off at the end of 1887 in Portsmouth and assigned to the Reserve until 1893 when she became a training ship at Portland. She was renamed HMS &quot;Boscawen II&quot; in March 1904 and transferred in 1905 to Harwich as part of the training school . The ship was renamed 11 June 1906 as HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; and then to &quot;Ganges II&quot; on 25 April 1908. She was sold on 30 January 1922 for scrap.

<doc id="1159492" wikidata="Q5175343" url="?curid=1159492" title="Cotham, Bristol">
<text>Cotham is an area of Bristol, England, about north of the city centre. It is an affluent, leafy, inner city suburb situated north of the neighbourhoods of Kingsdown and St Paul’s and sandwiched between Gloucester Road (A38) to the east, and Hampton Road to the west.

Cotham is closely related to the neighbourhood of Redland to the north, with the Severn Beach Railway Line broadly marking where Cotham ends and Redland begins, though Ward boundaries show Cotham extending to Redland Road. Redland’s boundaries is usually taken to extend to Coldharbour Road. To the north lies Bishopston and Westbury Park, and Durdham Down to the west. Cotham and Redland together make up the Bristol City Council&#x27;s Cotham and Redland Conservation Area.

It is also the name of a council ward of the city, which also includes other areas.

== The suburb ==
Cotham is characterised by its individually developed urban streets, dominated by a high-quality victorian townscape, in conjunction with its spacious, leafy character as a product of the individual gardens and areas of public landscape, both larger than average for an inner city suburb, generally handed down from earlier estate layouts of parklands. Over-arching these two elements is a dramatic local topography, which contributes greatly to the quantity and quality of views and panoramas.

The local architecture is typified by its use of Pennant and Brandon Hill stone and limestone in the form of Bath stone, with brick and render are also found. The hilly topography gives emphasis to roofs, bay windows and chimneys emphasising the scale and substance of victorian villa construction. The escarpments and hillside nature of development has also given rise to a variety of natural stone retaining walls, typical of the area.

It is a cosmopolitan residential area with large old houses, many of which are used as hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, or divided into flats, and a selection of small independent shops. It also contains the comprehensive Cotham School (formerly Cotham Grammar School).

The top of Saint Michael&#x27;s Hill in Cotham was one of the historical city limits of Bristol, and the traditional location for hangings. Between 1555 and 1557 three Marian martyrs were burned to death here for their religious beliefs. The gallows form one quarter of the badge of the local Rugby club, Cotham Park RFC.

Cotham Church was built in 1842–1843 by William Butterfield in a Gothic Revival style, as Highbury Congregational Chapel. It was Butterfield&#x27;s first commission, obtained through his family&#x27;s connection with William Day Wills of the tobacco firm W. D. &amp; H. O. Wills. The apse, tower, south transept and school were added in 1863 by Edward William Godwin. Since 1975 it has been an Anglican church.

== Demographics ==
Cotham ward had an estimated resident population of 11,693 according to mid-2019 estimates, based on changes to the ward definition in 2016. Using the same data, according to the Census of 2011, following 2016 ward changes, the resident population in mid-2011 was 11,715. The 2011 Census gave the ward a population of 12,554 according to the definition of Cotham ward in 2011.

Mid-2019 estimates gave the population of Cotham ward by age as being 9.0% aged 0–5 years; 33.2% aged 16–24 years; 31.6% aged 25–39 years; 11.7% aged 40–54 years; 6.1% aged 55–64 years; and 8.4% aged 65 years or older.

In the 2011 Census, 81.5% of residents considered themselves as being White British, 1.2% White Irish, 0.1% White Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 6.6% Other White, 3.4% Mixed, 1.6% Indian, 0.3% Pakistani, 0% Bangladeshi, 1.7% Chinese, 1.0% Other Asian, 0.9% Black African, 0.5% Black Caribbean, 0.4% Other Black, 0.4% Arab and 0.4% as Other ethnic group. Overall, 10.5% of residents considered themselves to be from a Black or Minority Ethnic group compared with 16% for Bristol as a whole. 85.1% or residents were born in the UK, with China, Germany and &#x27;Other EU countries&#x27; being the top three countries of birth outside of the UK.

In the 2011 Census, the largest group by religious belief was 51.8% considering themselves to have no religion, followed by 35.2% Christian, 8.4% Religion not stated, 1.3% Muslim, 0.9% Buddhist, 0.9% Hindu, 0.8% Other religions, 0.5% Jewish and 0.2% Sikh. Only the proportion of Cotham residents stating as themselves as having No religion (51.8% versus 37.4%) or being Jewish (0.5% versus 0.2%) was significantly higher than Bristol overall and only the proportion stating themselves as being Christian significantly lower (35.2% versus 46.8%).

== Electoral ward ==
The Cotham ward comprises Cotham, Kingsdown, and a large part of Redland. This follows extensive changes in 2016, when Kingsdown and more parts of Redland were added to the ward.

===Politics===

Cotham is part of the parliamentary constituency of Bristol Central. Since 2024 the Member of Parliament is Carla Denyer, a Green Party of England and Wales member.

Cotham is represented by two councillors on Bristol City Council. Currently, these are Mohamed Makawi and Guy Poultney. They are both members of the Green Party.

== Health ==
The Family Practice is a local general practice with a 70 year history. It provides primary care services to over 15,000 locally residents. In 1993 the practice moved to its current building, Western College. The College was designed by the Bristol architect, Henry Dare Bryan, in the Arts and Crafts style and is a Grade II listed building. It was opened in 1906 as a Theological Training College for the Congregational Church. From 1968 to 1990 it served as the offices of the Southern Universities Joint Examination Board. The Family Practice is a teaching practice for both GP specialist training and for teaching medical students from the University of Bristol.

The University of Bristol Student Health Service is a separate general practice located at Hampton House Health Centre, opposite Western College, providing primary care service to students of university their families with over 6,000 registrations a year. The Grade II listed Hampton House building itself is the former site of the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, built in 1925 in the Jacobethan Cotswold vernacular style by George Oatley, a local Bristol architect renowned for the design on many buildings locally, most notably the nearby Wills Memorial Building. Homeopathic treatments had been available in Bristol since 1854. As homeopathy services developed and expanded over time, its popularity required the building of a specialist hospital. Following his appointment as president of the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital in 1916, Walter Melville Wills commissioned the construction of the new hospital at the site, moving from its former location, a building in Brunswick Square. The commission was a gift to the city in remembrance of his son, killed in action in 1915 in the First World War. The Wills family owned a successful Bristol tobacco company and bequeathed the city a number of prominent buildings. Construction began in 1921 with the engraved foundation stone laid by Edward, Prince of Wales. The building ceased use as a homeopathic hospital in 1986 following the defunding of homeopathic services on the NHS.

Life expectancy at birth for Cotham residents is 87.5 years for females and 84.1 years for males. Both are significantly better than Bristol as a whole, where the life expectancy is 82.8 years for females and 78.5 years for males.

All cause premature mortality (defined as the directly age standardised rates of people dying of all causes before the age of 75 years) was 228.6 premature deaths per 100,000 population for Cotham ward, significantly better than the Bristol average of 381.2 people per 100,000 population. For selected causes of premature deaths, the directly age standardised rates of deaths under 75 years were 100.1 cancer deaths per 100,000 people, 25.1 deaths per 100,000 people due to cardiovascular disease and 15.5 deaths per 100,000 people due to respiratory causes. For Bristol as a whole, these rates were 151.6 cancer deaths per 100,000 people, 74.5 deaths per 100,000 people due to cardiovascular disease and 40.0 deaths per 100,000 people due to respiratory causes, with only the rate of premature death due to cardiovascular disease significantly different between Cotham residents and Bristol as a whole.

According to the Bristol Quality of Life survey, 94.0% of Cotham residents consider themselves to be in ‘good health’ compared with 87.6% for Bristol. 16.2% reported having an illness or health condition limiting day-to-day activities at least a little (25.7% for Bristol as a whole). 29.2% were overweight or obese (45.0% Bristol overall). 2.5% were classed as physically ’inactive’ (6.8% Bristol average). 85.7% did enough regular exercise each week (71.2% Bristol average). 5.6% were smokers (9.5% Bristol overall) and 0.6% reported living in households where someone regularly smokes in the house (3.9% Bristol overall).

13.9% were at ‘higher risk of alcohol related health problems’ (16.1% Bristol average). 7.8% were classed as having ‘above average mental wellbeing’ (9.9% Bristol average), whilst 8.0% were reported as having ‘below average mental wellbeing’ (14.7% Bristol average). 2.1% felt ‘lonely because they don’t see family enough’ (3.4% Bristol average). 75.7% reported being ‘satisfied with life’ (75.3% Bristol average) and 25.1% reported ‘very high life satisfaction’ (23.5% Bristol average). 6.1% reported a ‘low life satisfaction’ (9.0% Bristol average).

== Education ==
Cotham School is a secondary school with co-operative academy status, with a capacity for 1480 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years (Years 7 to 11). It is closely associated with nearby Redland Green School. Together the two schools collaboratively feed into North Bristol Post 16 Centre, a sixth form centre also based in Cotham. Cotham School was formally the Trade and Mines School from 1856 to 1885 and the Merchant Venturers&#x27; School until 1920.

Cotham School, through its former evolutions, has educated two Nobel Laureates, Paul Dirac (graduated 1918) and Peter Higgs (1946). Dirac, born in Bristol and growing up to the north of Cotham and Redland in the neighbourhood of Bishopston, made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schrödinger &quot;for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory&quot;. He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics.

Peter Higgs, born in Newcastle upon Tyne but raised in Bristol, is known for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism (known as the Higgs mechanism) that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle (known as the Higgs boson), by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider. Following the discover of the predicted Higgs boson, Higgs was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics along with François Englert. Higgs himself was inspired by the work of Paul Dirac whilst at the school. Higgs is recognised by the school through its science centre, the Dirac Higgs science, opened by Higgs himself in 2012.

Cotham Gardens Primary School (formerly Colston&#x27;s Primary School) is a primary school taking children from the ages of 5 to 11 years.

Although there are no public access libraries in the neighbourhood itself, the area is served by the nearby Redland Library to the west on Whiteladies road, Clifton; Bishopston Library on Gloucester Road to the east; and Bristol Central Library in the city centre to the south.

<text>The Costa Daurada (; ; meaning in English &quot;Golden Coast&quot;) is an area on the coast of Catalonia, Spain, between Cunit and Alcanar on the Mediterranean Sea.

Its traditional banks are the deltas of the Foix and Ebro rivers, although it mainly refers to the entire province of Tarragona. To the north it borders the Garraf Massif and it borders the Costa del Azahar
to the south.

Places of interest include the El Vendrell beaches, the town of Roc de San Gaieta, the Roman Arch of Bará, the remains of Tarraco, declared a World Heritage Site and as well as several small towns or places such as Sant Carles de la Ràpita, with one of the best fishing ports in this entire coastal sector. Inlands, the walled town of Montblanc and the Poblet Abbey stand out, where various kings of the Crown of Aragon lie.

Another tourist attraction on the Costa Dorada is the PortAventura World amusement park.

==Etymology==

Costa Daurada, literally, the Golden Coast, takes its name from the colour of its sand when the sun is shining.

<doc id="1159502" wikidata="Q1671085" url="?curid=1159502" title="Savage (Eurythmics album)">
<text>Savage is the sixth studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 9 November 1987 by RCA Records. The album peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies.

The album spawned a total of four singles – &quot;Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)&quot;, &quot;Shame&quot;, &quot;I Need a Man&quot; and &quot;You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart&quot;, all of which achieved considerable commercial success internationally. 

==Background==
Following the much more mainstream commercial content of their previous two albums, &quot;Savage&quot; saw Eurythmics &quot;turn sharp left&quot; (as band member Dave Stewart put it), returning to the much more experimental sound that their early albums incorporated. Produced in France (recorded at Chateau de Dangu in Normandy and mixed at Grande Armée Studios in Paris), the album made heavy use of the NED Synclavier digital sampling keyboard. The only other musician working on the recordings with Stewart and Annie Lennox was drummer Olle Romo, who handled much of the Synclavier programming. Lennox brought more of a feminist focus to her lyrics which was made more evident by the accompanying video album, which featured a video for each song.

==Release and reception==
Although the album was not as commercially successful as the duo&#x27;s previous two albums, it reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, spawned three UK top-30 singles, and has been certified Platinum. It was less successful in the United States, where it peaked at number 41.

On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released most of Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue (including &quot;Savage&quot;) as deluxe edition reissues. Each of their eight studio albums&#x27; original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes.

<doc id="1159512" wikidata="Q47412" url="?curid=1159512" title="Ferdinand I of Aragon">
<text>Ferdinand I (Spanish: &quot;Fernando I&quot;; 27 November 1380 – 2 April 1416 in Igualada, Òdena) named Ferdinand of Antequera and also the Just (or the Honest) was king of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and (nominal) Corsica and king of Sicily, duke (nominal) of Athens and Neopatria, and count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya (1412–1416). He was also regent of Castile (1406–1416). He was the first Castillian ruler of the Crown of Aragon.

==Biography==
Ferdinand was born 27 November 1380 in Medina del Campo, the younger son of King John I of Castile and Eleanor of Aragon.

On 15 August 1403 in Medina del Campo, Ferdinand founded a new order of knighthood, the Order of the Jar.

In 1406, upon the death of his elder brother, King Henry III of Castile, Ferdinand declined the Castilian crown and instead, with Henry&#x27;s widow Catherine of Lancaster, became coregent during the minority of his nephew John II of Castile. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of domestic affairs.

In a war with the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, he conquered the town of Antequera (1410), whence his surname.

After Ferdinand&#x27;s maternal uncle, King Martin I of Aragon (Martin II of Sicily), died without surviving legitimate issue, Ferdinand was chosen King of Aragon in 1412 to succeed him in the Compromise of Caspe. The other candidate, Count James II of Urgell (see Counts of Urgell), revolted and Ferdinand dissolved the County of Urgell in 1413.

Ferdinand created the title of Prince of Girona for the heir of the Crown of Aragon on 19 February 1416.

The most notable accomplishment of his brief reign was his agreement in 1416 to depose the Antipope Benedict XIII, thereby helping to end the Western Schism, which had divided the Roman Catholic Church for nearly 40 years.

He is buried in the Crown of Aragon&#x27;s royal pantheon of the monastery of Poblet, in a magnificent tomb ordered by his son Alfonso to Pere Oller in 1417.

The Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla wrote an official biography of Ferdinand, &quot;Historiarum Ferdinandi regis Aragonum libri sex&quot;.

==Family and children==
In 1394 Ferdinand married Eleanor of Alburquerque (1374–1435). They had seven children:
* Alfonso V of Aragon (1396–1458), king of Aragon, Sicily and Naples, married Maria of Castile
* John II of Aragon (1398–1479)
* Henry of Aragon (-1445), duke of Villena, count of Alburquerque and Empuries, lord of Sogorb, etc. and grand master of the military Order of Santiago, married Catherine of Castile
* Eleanor of Aragon, (1402–1445), queen of Portugal, who married Edward I of Portugal
* Maria of Aragon, (1403–1445), queen of Castile, first wife of John II of Castile
* Peter of Aragon (1406–1438), count of Alburquerque and duke of Noto
* Sancho of Aragon (c.1400–1416), grand master of the Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara

==Appearance and character==
&quot;He was tall, a little more than average, and thin and ruddy, and his cheeks had a few freckles... very patient to all who wanted to talk to him, even if their speeches were ordinary or not well-reasoned...&quot;

==Genealogy==

<text>SRI International&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center (ARC) was founded in the 1960s by electrical engineer Douglas Engelbart to develop and experiment with new tools and techniques for collaboration and information processing.

The main product to come out of ARC was the revolutionary oN-Line System, better known by its abbreviation, NLS. ARC is also known for the invention of the &quot;computer mouse&quot; pointing device, and its role in the early formation of the Internet.

Engelbart recruited workers and ran the organization until the late 1970s when the project was commercialized and sold to Tymshare, which was eventually purchased by McDonnell Douglas.

==Beginnings==
Some early ideas by Douglas Engelbart were developed in 1959 funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (now Rome Laboratory).
By 1962, a framework document was published.

J. C. R. Licklider, the first director of the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), funded the project in early 1963. First experiments were done trying to connect a display at SRI to the massive one-of-a-kind AN/FSQ-32 computer at the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California.

==NASA funding==
NASA began to provide major funding at the behest of Robert Taylor in 1964. A custom graphical workstation was built around a commercial computer, the CDC 160A, and a CDC 3100, which handled a single user at a time. In 1965, Taylor became IPTO director, leading to increased funding. In 1968 an SDS 940 computer running the Berkeley Timesharing System allowed multiple users.

The project was first called ARNAS after the sponsors. For a few years it was then called the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center, which got shortened to the Augmentation Research Center around 1969.

==The Mother of All Demos==
During a 90-minute session at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, Engelbart, Bill English, Jeff Rulifson and other ARC staffers presented their work in a live demonstration, including real-time video conferencing and interactive editing in an era when batch processing was still the paradigm for using computers. This was later called &quot;the Mother of All Demos&quot;.

==Reference library service==
Engelbart had volunteered ARC to provide the first reference library service on the ARPANET while it was being designed. The first message sent on ARPANET was between the ARC computer and UCLA. Larry Roberts continued to fund the ARC through DARPA IPTO until he left in 1974. The library service evolved into the Internet Network Information Center managed by Elizabeth J. Feinler. Bertram Raphael was put in charge of the project in 1976.

==Sale to Tymshare==
The technology was sold to Tymshare in 1977, with 20 members of the former SRI group (including Engelbart) becoming Tymshare employees. Only about three or four people were left to continue the NIC, although this group grew quickly along with the Internet. Jon Postel left in 1977 to join the Information Sciences Institute. A number of early participants moved on to careers at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and other leading computer companies.

Tymshare renamed the software &quot;Augment&quot; and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart&#x27;s desire to do further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart&#x27;s resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.

==Books about ARC==
The complex story of the rise and fall of ARC has been documented in a book by sociologist Thierry Bardini. From the perspective of the 1960s counter-culture revolution, John Markoff, in his book &quot;What the Dormouse Said&quot;, also follows Englebart&#x27;s persistence in creating ARC as not only a collection of talented off-beat engineers working in direct contrast to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory nearby, but also as a sociological experiment that constructed and tested methods for group creation and design.

ARC was also indirectly covered in many other books about Xerox PARC, since that is where many ARC employees later fled to (and brought some of Engelbart&#x27;s ideas with them). Taylor had founded the Computer Systems Laboratory at PARC in 1970.

<text>KC Accidental was a Canadian post-rock band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The band released two albums of mostly instrumental music. It later evolved into Broken Social Scene.

==History==
KC Accidental was formed in 1998, and started out as a two-person recording project consisting of Kevin Drew and Charles Spearin. The &quot;KC&quot; in the band&#x27;s name was taken from the initials of their first names. The pair began recording in a home studio; their debut album &quot;Captured Anthems for an Empty Bathtub&quot; was sold by Drew and Spearin exclusively through one shop in 1998 and quickly sold out.

The group released a second album in 2000 entitled &quot;Anthems for the Could&#x27;ve Bin Pills&quot; on Noise Factory Records. It included contributions from Jason Collett, Evan Cranley, Emily Haines, Jason McKenzie, Jessica Moss, James Payment, Bill Priddle, James Shaw and Justin Small. Many of these musicians went on to work with Drew and Spearin in Broken Social Scene, who released their debut album, &quot;Feel Good Lost&quot; on Noise Factory in 2001.

As a reference to the earlier group, Broken Social Scene included a song titled &quot;KC Accidental&quot; on its Juno Award-winning album &quot;You Forgot It in People&quot;.

The two albums by KC Accidental, long time out of print and out of reach, were reissued by Arts &amp; Crafts on 2CD/2LP format and digitally in 2010.

On June 21, 2013, KC Accidental performed a new 15-minute song entitled &quot;Summer Withdrawal&quot; live at Jason Collett&#x27;s Courtyard Revue in Toronto. It was the first time the band had performed in 13 years. A year later on June 20, 2014, KC Accidental reconvened for a full live show at the North by Northeast festival.

As of 2016, Broken Social Scene continues to perform the song &quot;KC Accidental&quot; in their live shows.

<text>We Too Are One is the seventh studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 11 September 1989 by RCA Records. It would be the duo&#x27;s last studio release until 1999&#x27;s &quot;Peace&quot;.

==Background and release==
When it was released in 1989, the album debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, where it has since been certified double platinum. It spawned four singles, all of which reached the UK top 30: &quot;Revival&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot;, &quot;The King and Queen of America&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;. In North America, &quot;(My My) Baby&#x27;s Gonna Cry&quot; was also released as a single; it charted at number 58 in Canada, while failing to chart in the United States.

On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue as Deluxe Edition reissues, including &quot;We Too Are One&quot;. The original track listing was supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes.

===Home media===
A companion home video, &quot;We Two Are One Too&quot;, was released in 1990, featuring the music videos for the five singles from the album and footage of the band performing the album&#x27;s other tracks. This is the only commercial release of the promotional video for the 1989 single &quot;Revival&quot;, which has never been included on any subsequent video compilations from the band.

<text>Charles Layman Terry Jr. (September 17, 1900 – February 6, 1970) was an American lawyer and politician from Dover, in Kent County, Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic Party and served as Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court as well as Governor of Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Terry was born at Camden, Delaware, son of Charles Layman Sr. and Elizabeth Maxon Terry. He attended Wesley College and the University of Virginia, receiving his law degree from Washington and Lee University. At Virginia, Terry was initiated into the Psi chapter of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Terry married Jessica Irby and had one child, Charles III. They were members of Christ Episcopal Church in Dover.

==Professional and judicial career==
Terry was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1924 and practiced in Dover, serving as attorney for the Kent County Levy Court and the Delaware General Assembly. In 1936, he was appointed Delaware Secretary of State. He then served as associate justice of the Delaware Superior Court from December 7, 1938, until April 29, 1957, and, as President Judge from that date, until July 23, 1962. He was then appointed justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and in May 1963 became its Chief Justice, serving until 1964.

Henry R. Horsey and William Duffy in their article on the Delaware Courts described Terry&#x27;s tenure as Judge as follows: &quot;In his twenty-five years on the bench, Judge Terry, or just plain &quot;Charlie&quot; as he preferred to be called, was, through his knowledge of the legislative process and influence with the General Assembly, instrumental in obtaining numerous judicial reforms. These included an increase in judicial salaries and significant improvements in the judicial pension system, establishment of full-time Courts of Common Pleas in Kent and Sussex Counties, enduring support for the creation of the present separate Supreme Court of Delaware and extensive improvements and enlargements of the judicial facilities in both the Public Building in Wilmington and the Kent County Courthouse.

==Governor of Delaware==
Terry had political ambitions and with the support of the incumbent governor, Elbert N. Carvel, resigned as chief justice. He was elected as Governor of Delaware in 1964, defeating former governor. Republican David P. Buckson, by 5,423 votes

As governor the former Justice instituted a major reform of the magistrate courts or justice of the peace court system, transforming a &quot;court once ridden with politics and favoritism&quot; into what eventually became &quot;an efficient system of salaried, full-time judges sitting in a courtroom setting and conducting proceedings under uniform written rules of procedure.&quot; In particular, the practice of paying fees to these officials based on the number of cases was ended, and they came to receive a set salary. A second change occurred with the purchase of Woodburn, the official Governor&#x27;s House. Governor Terry and his family were the first occupants. Terry&#x27;s other major initiative was the founding of the Delaware Technical and Community College, with a campus in each county. The former judge was proving to be a very effective governor; as deft, charming, and authoritative as appropriate.

However, Delaware could not escape the key issues of the 1960s, particularly the issue of racial equality. In the Delaware General Assembly there were lengthy debates about equal housing, but no significant legislation could be agreed upon. In the streets of Wilmington, a few nights of shootings in 1967 resulted in a curfew and a liquor sales ban. Terry went to the Delaware General Assembly and demanded and received the authority to declare a state of emergency with crowd control powers. He immediately put the emergency into effect and although the violence was ended in a week, continued the emergency for another month. Then, a year later, real problems came with the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. A few days later Wilmington exploded in two days of self-destructive rioting, looting and burning. Terry again responded with an emergency declaration and sent the National Guard in to assist the city police. A week later, when the situation seemed under control, the mayor lifted the curfew and requested the withdrawal of the National Guard. Believing there was more violence to come, Terry refused. It was not until Terry left office, eight months later, that the National Guard was removed from the streets of Wilmington. While all this was simmering, students at Delaware State College in Dover shouted down Terry during a speech and briefly occupied the administration building. Terry responded by closing down the school for a month. Terry had become known by some as &quot;The Great Divider.&quot;

Terry was not without considerable support for his notable accomplishments and for the way he handled the violence in Wilmington. He campaigned for a second term and only narrowly lost, believing an October heart attack and a rezoning dispute in Sussex County cost him the election. However, 1968 was a Republican sweep, and Russell W. Peterson, a chemist from New Castle County, was able to defeat him by 2,114 votes, undoubtedly helped by a large number of Democrats in Wilmington who were seeking new leadership to end the tension and violence.

==Death and legacy==
Terry died at Dover and is buried there in the Christ Episcopal Church Cemetery. The Charles L. Terry Campus of the Delaware Technical and Community College at Dover is named in his honor.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The governor takes office the third Tuesday of January and has a four-year term. All judicial positions are appointed by the governor.

<text>Herdecke () is a town in the district of Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. It is located south of Dortmund in the Ruhr Area. Its location between the two Ruhr reservoirs Hengsteysee and Harkortsee has earned it the nickname &quot;Die Stadt zwischen den Ruhrseen&quot; (lit. &quot;The city between the Ruhr lakes&quot;).

The city is located in the area of the Regionalverband Ruhr (RVR). The two Ruhr lakes as well as the forests on the Ardey heights make the town attractive to tourists. The historic center with its many half timbered houses and the 30-metre-high railway viaduct across the Ruhr valley are two more landmarks.

==Geography==

Herdecke is located at the foot of the Ardeygebirge, the northwestern part of the Sauerland, between Dortmund in the North and Northeast, Hagen in the South, Wetter (Ruhr) in the Southwest and Witten in the West and Northwest. Herdecke lies between 80 and 274 meters above sea levels. It lies on the north bank of the river Ruhr, between the Harkortsee to the west and the Hengsteysee to the east.

===Geology===
Though part of the Ruhrgebiet, the town was only indirectly influenced by the mining of coal, as it has few coal beds.

===Climate===

The average precipitation is between 850 and 900 mm. The average temperature is around 10.6 °C.

===Town structure===

Most of Herdecke lies North of the Ruhr except for a small part at the Ruhr bridge. The town is about 8 kilometers in length from North-East to South-West and 5 kilometers in width from North-West to South-East.

Herdecke has two major settlements: Herdecke proper and Ende. The latter covers the former town of Ende with its farming communities Kirchende, Ostende, Westende and Gedern as well as the &quot;mansion district&quot; Ahlenberg.

==History==

The origin of Herdecke was the foundation of a women&#x27;s monastery at the beginning of the 9th century. The former monastery church (&quot;Stiftskirche&quot;), which was rebuilt in the second half of the 13th century, still retains parts of the original Carolingian construction.

In 1324 Herdecke went from ownership of the Electorate of Cologne to the County of Mark. The count took all jurisdiction from the abbess and erected a pillory in front of the church which existed until 1700. 1355 market rights were given by Count Engelbert III. In the following centuries the regionally important corn market developed thanks to the good connection to trading roads from Cologne to the Weser area, Münsterland and Siegerland.

1594 free jurisdiction was canceled. In 1615 Herdecke became a &quot;Freiheit&quot;. In the winter of 1624/1625, Herdecke was host to a garrison of Spanish military. It was given city rights by Friedrich Wilhelm I in 1739.

The Fourth Edition of &quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; noted in 1888: „Herdecke, town in Prussian government district Arnsberg, Hagen, 104 meters above sea levels. Lies at the navigable Ruhr and the lines Hagen-Witten, Hagen-Dahlhausen and Schwelm-Dortmund of the Prussian State Railroad Company. Has an evangelic and catholic church, great sandstone quarries as well as factories for fabrics, tobacco, leather paper and hardware, dye works and beer brewing. On the heights of the town is the Kaisberg with a tower commemorating the Baron of Stein; further away are the remnants of the Hohensyburg; the new tower was erected to honour president v. Vinke. Underneath the Hohensyburg lies the Sonnenstein, a 200 meter high plateau where every year in June the famous Rhein-Westfalic Sonnenstein fair is being held. Next to Herdecke lies Vorhalle with its iron and brass factories.“

1939 Ende was incorporated into Herdecke. In World War II the town was &quot;godfather&quot; to the U 751, a submarine that was sunk in the Atlantic by British planes on 17 July 1942.

===Population history===

In the course of two centuries between 1739 and 1939 Herdecke changed from a medieval market town to a flourishing small town. The population between 1939 and 1993 grew at 147% because of people&#x27;s wishes to &quot;have a green home&quot;. In the 1990s the population reached its maximum to this day (26,500). The population slowly declined afterwards.

Because of the population grow Herdecke is a town with the most sealed surfaces in the Government District of Arnsberg. More than a third of the town&#x27;s surface has been built upon and almost 300 square metres of surface per person is sealed.

===Emblem===

The Herdecke emblem is a silvern oak on a hill bearing yellow fruit upon a red shield. The so-called &quot;Herta-Oak&quot; has been the city&#x27;s trademark for a long time. A city seal of 1784 already shows a tree. Since the giving of the emblem by the Prussian Government in 1902, the official emblem bears a wall with three towers on the top side.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Herdecke is Katja Strauss-Köster, an independent politician endorsed by the CDU, The Greens, and FDP. She was first elected in 2009, winning 71% of votes, and re-elected in 2015. In the most recent mayoral election on 13 September 2020, Strauss-Köster was re-elected again with 66.0% of votes, defeating Jan-Christoph Schaberick of the SPD.

===City council===

The Herdecke city council governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

<text>The Raleigh Chopper is a bicycle (referred to as a wheelie bike) for children / young adults, manufactured and marketed by the Raleigh Bicycle Company of Nottingham, England. The unique design became a cultural icon and is fondly remembered by many who grew up in that period. The design was influenced by dragsters, &quot;chopped&quot; motorcycles, beach buggies, and even chariots, as can be seen on the centre page of the 1969 Raleigh US catalogue. The bicycle has featured in many movies and TV series. MK1 models were produced from 1968 to 1972, MK2 models were produced from 1972 to 1983 and MK3 models were produced from 2004 to 2012 and sold through to 2018.
*MK1 - was available in 3, 5 or 10 speed models. Brilliant Orange, Golden Yellow, Flamboyant Green, Targa Mustard (HBR model), and Horizon Blue.
* Sprint GT - available in either Bronze or Flamboyant Green.
* MK2 - standard 3 speed models available in Infra Red, Ultra Violet, Fizzy Lemon, Quick Silver, Space Blue, and Jet Black (Prismatic decal model).
* MK2 - Pink 5 Speed (Derailleur)
* MK2 - SE with cast alloy mag wheels to commemorate 750,000 choppers
* MK3 - Standard available in Black, Purple, Red, Silver, Pink, Yellow
* MK-IV - Ultra-Violet and Infra Red only at initial release.

==Design==
The Raleigh Chopper design has been subject of debate but only since 1996, with claims by Alan Oakley (1927–2012) chief designer for Raleigh and then more than 30 yrs later, from Tom Karen of OGLE Design.

Alan Oakley&#x27;s archive was sold in 2018 (Mellor &amp; Kirk Auctioneers, Nottingham, August 2018) and reveals valuable insight into this debate that until 2018 had not been seen in public. The archive reveals that the Design Council did not consult Raleigh before citing Tom Karen as designer of the Chopper and the Design Museum merely acknowledge Karen as the designer of the finished &#x27;product&#x27;. The Oakley archive contains an account from the then managing director and Chairman of Raleigh that reveals the reasoning for Raleigh sending their chief designer to America for a three-week fact-finding mission, it describes the trip, the &#x27;envelope sketch&#x27; that provided the inspiration for the eventual product and the months following the trip. It describes the market&#x27;s need for the Chopper and the strategy for going to market. Whilst this debate was active for a short while, study of the Oakley archive confirms that Oakley&#x27;s famous envelope sketch was the inspiration and was included in the brief that was offered to an outside design firm, OGLE design, who then designed the product.

The Raleigh Chopper was the bike that rescued Raleigh from administration with huge global sales from a total production run including Mk1 Mk2 Mk3 models which ran from 1968 to 1983 (mk1 &amp; mk2) and then 2004 to 2012 (mk3).

The Chopper featured in numerous TV series and movies throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Back to the future&quot;. Until the BMX came along in the mid-1980s, the Chopper outsold other bikes by 6 to 1.

In 2014 a 1980 MK2 Raleigh Chopper gifted to US President Ronald Reagan sold at auction for a record $35,000.

The Chopper was designed in response to the Schwinn Sting-Ray, and an earlier attempt, the Rodeo, which was not commercially successful. The popularity of the Chopper also led to a range of smaller bikes following a similar design theme. These included the Raleigh Chipper, Tomahawk and Budgie models, aimed at younger riders.

== History ==

=== Mk 1 ===

Mk1 1968 to 1972. The Chopper&#x27;s patent was applied for in the US in 1967. The Chopper was introduced at American trade shows in January 1969 but it was not until April 1969 when Raleigh Choppers were available for public to purchase. The bike featured a choice of a single-speed coaster hub, a 3-speed coaster, a standard non-coaster 3 speed or 5-speed (3+2) Sturmey Archer gear hub, selected using a frame-mounted console gear lever. Other features that appealed to the youth market were the unusual frame, long padded high-back seat, sprung seat at the back, high-rise (ape hanger) handlebars, &#x27;bobbed&#x27; mudguards (fenders) and differently sized wheels: front and rear. The rear hoop above the seat resembled a dragster anti roll bar &quot;sissy bar&quot;. Even the kickstand was designed to give the stationary bicycle a lean reminiscent of a parked motorcycle. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring a red line around the sidewall.

In 1969 the Raleigh Chopper was launched on the UK market. This was a triple launch for Raleigh with the Mk1 Chopper produced until 1972. The Chopper was branded as THE HoT oNE, alongside the Moulton Mk3 (The Smooth One), and the RSW Mk3 (The Dolly One). The Chopper was sold as a &quot;must have&quot; item and signifier of &quot;coolness&quot; for many children at the time.

=== Mk 2 ===
1972 to 1983 The Mk 2 (&quot;Mark 2&quot;) Chopper was an improved version sold from 1972. It had the rarely-purchased option of five-speed derailleur gears (1973/74 &quot;Pinky&quot;), and the gear lever shifter reverted from a knob to a T-bar-style shifter only with a different style to the lever. (The earlier &#x27;Tall frame&#x27; model had already sported the T-bar style, albeit with a black shifter handle with an elliptical window within the shifter cover.) The frame was subtly revised, and the seat shortened, bringing rider weight forwards of the rear axle (and thus the fulcrum point of balance) to help prevent the front of the bicycle lifting up. A small rear rack was added, the handlebars were welded to the stem to stop children from inclining the &quot;ape hanger&quot; bars backward, thereby rendering the bicycle almost unsteerable. A drop-handlebar version, the Sprint GT, was produced 1972 - 1973 and this differed from the standard Mk 2 as it had a slightly taller frame. The Chopper Mk 2 remained in production until 1983, by which time the BMX craze had taken over its market. However, the Chopper almost single-handedly rescued Raleigh, which had been in decline during the 1960s, selling over a million of the model worldwide.

== Mk 3 ==
After being out of production for over 20 years, a new version of the Chopper, the Mk3, was launched in 2004. In deference to modern safety concerns, adopted a more conventional saddle design from a single one-piece saddle to a split saddle and cissybar arrangement to circumvent saddle height laws, and dropped the groin-catching gear lever in favour of handlebar mounted gear controls; to commemorate this former feature the Mk3 had a sticker where the lever once was located. It was available at first in red, then purple then various colours followed including Limited Release models. . Rather than steel, the frame was made from aluminium alloy tubing to make the bicycle lighter. The wheels were still 20 inches at the back and 16 at the front. In 2012, all unsold stock was brought back in-house, re-liveried (new colours and decals) and then sold off up to and including 2018. Available in various colours including Purple, Yellow, Polished alloy, White, Pearl white, Black, Red and some runs of Limited Releases such as the World Cup Edition, Beano edition, and Ben Sherman edition.

The Mk3 was never manufactured in Nottingham UK and instead production was either based in the US, Taiwan or Vietnam.

== MK - IV ==

=== Brief outline ===
The MK-IV is the latest model to be added to the Raleigh chopper range and is a return to the classic mk2 model outline in all major design aspects but with the need to comply with modern legislation (see Design below).

Released to the General public in June 2023 the entire available stock sold out within three hours.

Available colours were Ultra-Violet and Infra-Red.

Two members of the enthusiast movement were invited to work with and on the design team from 2020.

Support in the form of Q&amp;A and general advice for and about the new model has been and continues to be given in a social media group specific to the new model since the official media launch. The group is currently headed by the two enthusiasts who worked with and on the Raleigh design team, therefore the knowledge being shared about the MK-IV is accurate, well presented and openly shared with everyone, rather than being gatekept as is so prevalent elsewhere.

=== Design ===
The MK-IV project was started in 2019 with the intention for the new model to be released in 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of the release of the mk2. However, world events delayed this until 2023. The team behind the new MK-IV invited two members of the Raleigh Chopper Enthusiast movement Mr K Price and Mr R Whitmill to work with and as part of the design team from 2020.

Based upon and reverse engineered from the Mk2, the MK-IV Chopper is an updated version that complies to contemporary safety standards as at time of manufacture, with a frame that is stronger than any previous model through use of modern tube materials with thicker walling.

There are a number of differences between the mk2 and the MK-IV, most notably the saddle, which, as per contemporary regulations and safety standards, is slightly shorter in height at the rear end. The saddle is also slightly wider at the front. The other most notable difference is the low height sissybar, which is the same style as was used on the mk2 Sprint GT as well as some USA models of the chopper from the late mk1 onwards. Again, this is to meet contemporary regulations as at time of the design process.

With the shifter once again returning to the cross-bar, the need to completely redesign the inner mechanism arose. It was, therefore, designed in such a way as to be made from laser cut steel which includes the slider table as part of the shifter base itself whilst also having cable guides. The shifter lever is held between &quot;plate packs&quot; either side of the lever acting to space the lever into the centre. One set of these plate packs on one side of the shifter lever house the indexing plate, bearing and spring which gives the shifter mechanism the ability to correctly set the cable position for each gear of the SRF3 rear hub. This new shifter works with the AW hubs of prior models and original shifters work with the SRF3 proving compatibility forwards and backwards.

Other design elements include a newly designed heron head chainwheel, a newly manufactured spoke protector to match the original design, a return to twin block pedals and a specifically newly designed headbadge to match the original other than being a stick-on type vs the original rivetted on type.

The pedals were manufactured once again under the UNION brand (owned by Marwi group from 1995). Union previously produced the pedals as used on late mk1 and all mk2 models as well as other Raleigh bicycles of the period. Uniquely, these new pedals also carry a narrow reflector, a feature harking back to the early twin-block pedals used on late mk1 and early mk2 Raleigh Choppers before legislation required slightly wider reflectors be utilised. The new narrow reflectors, however, are sized between the original narrow reflector s and the later larger reflectors and thus are a hybrid between the two styles.

The spoke protector is of a brushed finish and does not carry any makers mark, though it is in all other ways a perfect duplication in size and pattern to the later alloy type as used on the mk2 models

The handlebars are of the same pattern as the mk2 model, however they do not have the ball bearing groove and carry a tapered locking wedge in place of the conical locking wedge used on the mk1 and mk2 models. All handlebars carry dates on the lower end of the stem as well as under the left hand handlebar grip.

Brake levers and brake callipers are alloy Dia Compe units.

Wheel rims are once again steel and a very close duplicate of the original type used on the mk2. However, they are now made from 2mm steel and thus a single skin &quot;U&quot; shape rather than 1mm steel folded over with an inner shoulder, as per the original type.

The wheels are laced to contemporary standard alloy hubs, utilising 12G stainless steel spokes for the rear wheel and 14G stainless steel spokes for the front wheel. In line with contemporary standards, both wheels are spoked with a woven pattern.

One not-so-obvious change in design is seen within the chainstays. On mk1 and mk2 models, the &quot;S&quot; bend of the chainstays started inches (38.1mm) behind the saddle post tube of the frame. On the MK-IV this &quot;S&quot; bend starts at 1/2 inch (12.7mm) behind the saddle post tube.

== MK-IV Production ==

=== Prototypes ===
Production of prototypes occurred Twice

Production of the first prototype batch occurred in April 2021, then again in October 2022 a further batch of prototype frames were manufactured. In each case, three frames were produced. Of the April 2021 batch, only frame number three (RE210003) passed testing and is the only frame that remains extant.

Of the October 2022 frames, frame number one (RN220001) was used as a test mule and destroyed (photos exist of this testing), whilst frame number two (RN220002) and frame number three (RN220003) were painted in Ultra-Violet and Infra Red respectively. These were, are and remain the only painted prototypes to exist and they are the first of any of the new model to carry the colours decided on for the &quot;first launch&quot; models. These colours were chosen as the first to be released in recognition of these colours being the launch colours of the mk2 model of 1972.

Later into the R&amp;D process, RN220003 the Infra-Red prototype, was used as a parts compatibility test mule, this involving removal of parts from the MK-IV for test fitment on a mk2, as well as mk2 parts being tested for fitment on a MK-IV to prove compatibility both backwards as well as forwards.

The RN22 prototypes carry wheel rims of a slightly different profile, early dated shifter covers and handlebars, have thin vinyl decals on the shifter covers vs the better quality production decals, slightly different front forks and slightly different mudguards. RN220003 still carries prototype pedals.

=== Main production ===
Full production of the MK-IV started in February 2023 and lasted through March 2023 for the first release of this new model, production of the frames being carried out in Taiwan. Other parts specifically for the new model were manufactured as well as appropriate parts from other manufacturers / models being used.

The frames are constructed of metric tubing with a thicker wall than previous models due to contemporary safety standards making all tubing much stronger than the previous models. With all joints TIG welded, rather than using a mix of brazing and welding as used on the mk1 and mk2 models, the new frames are therefore more robustly constructed.

Paint finish is achieved utilising etch primer over the bare metal, followed by white primer, colour coat, then decal application, followed by a coat of clear lacquer. All paints used being water-based.

Decals are slightly smaller due to the new tubing sizes and were reduced proportionately to suit during the design process.

The &quot;Arrow Wedge&quot; design decal carries the number 954917. Although this number bears no relationship on or to the design of the new MK-IV frame, it is carried as a continuation of the prior number carried on the last of the mk2 models, which was 954916 (prev 954915, prev &quot;design no applied for&quot;).

=== Production colourway patterns ===
With the RN22 Prototypes, the Pattern was EVEN numbers were Ultra-Violet (RN220002) and ODD numbered frames were Red (RN22003).

Main production started in February 2023 by reversing the colorway pattern of the RN22 prototypes. Frame number RB230001 being in Ultra-Violet, then RB230002 in Infra-Red. This alternating pattern was followed to the end of the month, thus ODD numbered RB23 frames are Ultra-Violet and EVEN numbered frames are Infra-Red.

In March 2023, the pattern reversed again so that ODD numbered frames are Infra Red (Ex. RD230001) and EVEN numbered frames are Ultra-Violet (Ex. RD230002) and thus run in identical colorway sequence to the RN22 prototypes.

There are, as with any production environment, exceptions to the above patterns.

== MK-IV launch ==
The Raleigh Chopper MK-IV underwent three launch events. One private launch, two public launches and these events consisted of both Official and supported Private campaigns.

The first launch event was an invite only VIP &quot;Soft Launch&quot; in May 2023 consisting of a few select members of the Raleigh Chopper enthusiast movement. This was held at the (now closed) &quot;Experience Raleigh&quot; center in Maid Marian Way, Nottingham

The second launch event was the official media launch of 31 May 2023. From this point onwards both Raleigh UK and the two members of the enthusiast movement who were working with and on the design team provided information on and about the new model being released. Raleigh UK used the National newspapers, television and social media, whilst the two enthusiasts, with the blessing of Raleigh UK, worked privately using social media and the Annual Raleigh Chopper show website exclusively to bring news and information of the new model to the general public and enthusiasts alike.

The third launch event was the official sales launch of 20 June 2023, once again held at the (now closed) &quot;Experience Raleigh&quot; center in Maid Marian Way, Nottingham. Doors were opened to VIP guests at 10am whilst, officially at least, the doors were opened to the general public at 12pm. Four of the new model were on display, these consisting of the two RN22 prototypes being displayed in the window to the right of the doorway, with RB230002 (Infra Red) and RD230010 (Ultra-Violet) taking centre-stage in front of a balloon arch where people could get &quot;hands-on&quot; with the new model, inspect and even pose with them for photographs. Previous generations of the model (mk1, mk2 &amp; mk3) were also on display courtesy of enthusiasts who brought them along to the event.

Between official media launch, yet prior to official sales launch, Raleigh UK attended and had a display stand at the Annual Raleigh Chopper show 2023, held at Emberton Country Park (Prev. held at Billing Aquadrome) in early June 2023. This consisted of a display of previous generations of the Chopper with two of the new MK-IVs forming part of the display, one of those being Ultra-Violet RD230010, the other being Infra Red RB230002. Only two other MK-IV&#x27;s were in attendance, those belonging to the two enthusiasts who were working with the Raleigh design department and who were carrying out private publicity campaigns for the new model with the blessing of Raleigh UK after receiving one each of the new MK-IV. These two privately owned MK-IV&#x27;s were not only the very first in private ownership, even before official media launch or sales launch, but they were on display for the purpose of inspection by fellow enthusiasts. With many attendees of the show choosing to test ride them, it proved a great method of further promoting the new model, along with those on display by Raleigh UK.

The reasoning behind the two MK-IVs being in private ownership was, in part, to allow time for real-world testing and feedback as well as for acquisition of photographic material for the private publicity campaign.

== MK-IV sales ==
The MK-IV Chopper was sold online through the Raleigh Bikes UK website and at the Nottingham &quot;Experience Raleigh&quot; showroom from, officially at least, 12pm, 20 June 2023. Available only in Ultra-Violet or Infra-Red and available only to the home market. All available bikes sold out on day-one within three hours, demonstrating that demand for these iconic bikes after some 51 years since the introduction of the MK2 in 1972 has not waned but increased.

These sales also included the sale of the two RN22 prototypes to private buyers.

Further inventory, not available on sales launch day was released for sale through the website on 25 July 2023 and again, sold out within hours. This was expected to be the last of the inventory, however, a further 50 unsold MK-IVs were released for sale through the website on 24 August 2023. Once again, selling out within hours.

Despite these sales, there have been a considerable number of complaints made about the quality of the wheel rims, particularly about the finish of the joints of the rims. In some cases, wheel rims that appear &quot;egg&quot; shaped and in other instances, poor welded joints in the rims that were actually cracked. Despite these issues, the vast majority of those who purchased one are happy with them, even those with replacement wheels.

== MK-IV Dating ==

Dating the new MK-IV is relatively easy as it uses a slightly modified form of the 1974 onwards frame numbering system.

In Basic Form the frame sequence breaks down as follows:

R = Raleigh,

N = October,

22 = Year,

the last 4 digits constitute the number of the frame built that month, in sequential order, resetting to 0001 the following month.

== MK-IV full tools list ==

The following full tools list was put together to aid those who own a MK-IV in knowing which tools are required for each part of the bike.

It is released to the general public in the hope that it will be of use both contemporaneously as well as in the future.

==Original models==

===North American market===
The North American market had a much wider spectrum of models and colours available. In 1971 there was a ban on tall sissy bars so the chopper was only sold with a low back rest. A summary of US models:

* MK1 1969 &#x27;Tall Frames&#x27;; available as a single speed coaster (SC), 3 speed (AW - three speed and TCW - three speed coaster), and 5 speed (S5 - 3+2).

====Canada====

The Raleigh Chopper was also sold through Eaton&#x27;s in Canada, badged as Gliders, and sold as the Fastback 100, Fastback XT101, SS357, ULT, Princess and MACH-2 models.

=== Worldwide sales ===
Raleigh sold the Chopper to many countries worldwide. In some countries Raleigh chose to sell Choppers with alternative brands. These included BSA, Hercules, Humber, Malvern Star, Phillips, Robin Hood, Rudge and Speedwell Fireballs.

=== Imitators ===
The success of the Chopper led to similarly styled imitators, such as the Pavemaster Trusty Tracker, Triang Dragster, Dawes Zipper, Panther and Vindec High Riser in the UK as well as the very close copy of an Mk 2 named &quot;Cincoa&quot; as well as a Portuguese variant called the Chapparal, and in more recent years the Ground Cruiser which was sold in the UK at the same time as the release of the MK 3.

<doc id="1159557" wikidata="Q413728" url="?curid=1159557" title="Cefuroxime">
<text>Cefuroxime, sold under the brand name Zinacef among others, is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat and prevent a number of bacterial infections. These include pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, sepsis, urinary tract infections, and Lyme disease. It is used by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects may include &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection, anaphylaxis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to be safe. It is a second-generation cephalosporin and works by interfering with a bacteria&#x27;s ability to make a cell wall resulting in its death.
Cefuroxime was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Cefuroxime is active against many bacteria including susceptible strains of Staphylococci and Streptococci, as well as a range of gram negative organisms. As with the other cephalosporins, it is susceptible to beta-lactamase, although as a second-generation variety, it is less so. Hence, it may have greater activity against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, and Lyme disease. Unlike other second-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime can cross the blood–brain barrier.

A systematic review found high quality evidence that injecting the eye with cefuroxime after cataract surgery will lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis after surgery.

==Side effects==
Cefuroxime is generally well tolerated, and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headaches/migraines, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class.

Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and penicillin, an assessment in 2006 have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins.

==Related compounds==
Cefuroxime axetil is an ester prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective when taken by mouth. It is a second-generation cephalosporin.

==Trade names==
In the US it is marketed as Zinacef by Covis Pharmaceuticals since the company acquired the U.S. rights to the product from GSK. GSK had continued marketing a pediatric oral suspension as Ceftin; however, this presentation was discontinued as of 24 June 2017.

In Bangladesh, it is available as Sefur by Opsonin Pharma, Kilbac by Incepta, Axim by Aristopharma, Rofurox by Radiant, Xorimax by Sandoz and Uroxime by EURO Pharma Ltd. In India, it is available as Ceftum and Cefuall by Allencia Biosciences in tablet form and Supacef in injection form by GSK. In Poland, it is available as Zamur by Mepha, subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. In Australia, the &quot;first generic&quot; form of Cefuroxime axetil, Pharmacor Cefuroxime (tablets) from Pharmacor Pty Ltd, was registered on 27 March 2017, by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Cefuroxime axetil is sold in tablet form in Turkey under the brand names Aksef  and Cefaks. Cefuroxime axetil is also available (in two strengths) as granules for oral suspension from Aspen Pharmacare Australia Pty Ltd under the brand name Zinnat cefuroxime.

<doc id="1159563" wikidata="Q949491" url="?curid=1159563" title="Peace (Eurythmics album)">
<text>Peace is the eighth and final studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 18 October 1999 by RCA Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album of new material in 10 years, following 1989&#x27;s &quot;We Too Are One&quot;.

==Background and release==
After their first performance together in eight years at a record company party in 1998, Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart began writing and recording together for the first time since 1989. After a benefit concert at the Institute of Contemporary Arts for the family of Ruth Picardie, a journalist who died of breast cancer, the duo convened at The Church Studios to write new music. The band had previously recorded their &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; album in 1984 at the facility, which they had rented and converted into a recording studio two years prior. By the time they received news of their upcoming Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the band had amassed half an album&#x27;s worth of songs.

Much of the songwriting took place in the recording studio, where the two songwriters frequently restructured and rearranged their material. Stewart described the process as &quot;creating a collage&quot;, where his rough melodic ideas and Lennox&#x27;s lyrics would go through multiple iterations until they arrived at the final product. The band used a Marantz CDR640 CD recorder for the project, which Stewart selected because of its audio capabilities. &quot;At the end of the session, I can take away a true representation of what we have done. I can listen to alternative mixes or listen back to a different arrangement in the car or at home and know I&#x27;m hearing the same thing that I hear in the studio.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title was designed to reflect the duo&#x27;s ongoing concern with global conflict and world peace. It was promoted with a concert on the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Rainbow Warrior II&quot;, where they played a mixture of old and new songs. A world tour, titled the Peacetour, followed soon after, with all profits donated to Amnesty International and Greenpeace. The final show of the tour, on 6 December 1999 at the London Docklands Arena, was filmed and released on VHS and DVD.

===Singles===
&quot;I Saved the World Today&quot; served as the lead single from the album, reaching number 11 on the UK singles chart—their highest-charting single there since 1986. The second single, &quot;17 Again&quot;, was released in January 2000. It reached the UK top 30 and topped the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In May 2000, &quot;Peace Is Just a Word&quot; was released as a promotional single in the United Kingdom with &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; as its B-side.

===2005 re-release===
On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue as &quot;Deluxe Edition Reissues&quot;. Each of their eight studio albums&#x27; original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes. For unknown reasons, many songs on the 2005 reissue of &quot;Peace&quot; are alternate mixes compared to the original 1999 release. The most dramatically different mix is &quot;I&#x27;ve Tried Everything&quot;, which is more upbeat with additional drums. Other songs with mix differences include &quot;17 Again&quot;, &quot;I Saved the World Today&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Power to the Meek&quot; (missing a verse from the original version), and live tracks were substituted for the original studio versions of &quot;I Want It All&quot; and &quot;Peace Is Just a Word&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Critics were generally impressed with the album, although &quot;NME&quot; commented that it &quot;lacked the power&quot; of their previous releases. &quot;Q&quot; magazine opined that the release of the album &quot;quietly acknowledged that their solo careers had failed&quot;, despite the fact that both of Lennox&#x27;s solo albums up to that point had reached number one in the UK and been certified multi-platinum in both the UK and US.

<text>Dallas Baptist University (DBU) is a private Baptist university in Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1898 as Decatur Baptist College, Dallas Baptist University currently operates campuses in Dallas, Plano, and Hurst. It is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas.

==History==
Dallas Baptist University (formerly known as Decatur Baptist College and Dallas Baptist College) opened in Decatur, Texas in 1898. The Baptist General Convention of Texas purchased the land in 1897 from Northwest Texas Baptist College. The school enjoyed a rich, full history in Decatur until 1965 when it moved to Dallas at the invitation of the Dallas Baptist Association.

The school&#x27;s historic Administration Building in Decatur, built in 1893, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was destroyed in a fire on March 18, 2023, after years of service as the Wise County Heritage Museum.

In October 1965, Dallas Baptist College began offering classes to its first class of over 900 students. The initial piece of land for the campus, overlooking Mountain Creek Lake in the hill country of southwest Dallas, was donated by John Stemmons, Roland Pelt, and associates. An interested group of businessmen donated additional acreage, and in 1994 a donation by the Louis Hexter family brought the current size of the DBU campus, known as University Hill, to . In 2018, an additional land acquisition increased the total campus size to .

In 1968, the college moved from junior college to senior college status, subsequently offering its first four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees in May 1970. In 1985, the college officially changed its name to Dallas Baptist University. The new structure consisted of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Mary C. Crowley College of Christian Faith, the Dorothy M. Bush College of Education, and the College of Business.

===Growth and expansion===

In 2019, the university enrolled 4,487 students. The university offers 84 undergraduate majors, 24 master&#x27;s degree programs, over 45 dual master&#x27;s programs, and 2 doctoral programs. While in its early years, the school had the reputation of being a commuter college, today&#x27;s DBU has well over 2,000 students living on campus.

In 1992, the John G. Mahler Student Center, the first new building on the DBU campus in more than 20 years was dedicated. The building is a close replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was the first of many new buildings in the Georgian architectural style on the campus.
In 2009, the Patty and Bo Pilgrim Chapel was dedicated. The structure is used for various events such as chapel services and concerts, and houses office space for the Graduate School of Ministry along with classrooms and a large multipurpose room. The inspiration for the exterior of the building came from the First Baptist Church in America, located in Providence, Rhode Island.

 In the fall of 2011, the university opened the Joan and Andy Horner Hall. Named after the founders of Premier Designs, Horner Hall houses the DBU communication department, the offices for the College of Fine Arts, a multipurpose classroom and video recording studio, a design lab, and a music business recording studio, designed by the Russ Berger Design Group. The exterior of the structure is modeled after Congress Hall located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 2001, DBU-North opened in Carrollton, Texas as DBU&#x27;s first regional academic center, serving North Dallas and Collin County. For several years, DBU-North was located in Frisco, Texas, and in 2011, moved to Plano, Texas. DBU also opened DBU-Hurst-Colleyville in Hurst in the summer of 2005.

In 2015, Jim and Sally Nation Hall opened its doors. A near replica of Monticello, the building is the home of the Gary Cook School of Leadership, as well as other administrative offices. The building also houses several classrooms as well as a special event space situated in the dome of the building.

Further locations for special programs and opportunities include the Department of Military Science at University of Texas at Arlington (Army ROTC), Aerospace Studies at Texas Christian University (Air Force ROTC), and the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics in Dallas Texas.
==Academics==

Dallas Baptist University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM). The College of Business is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) to offer the Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) and the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) business degrees.

The teacher, principal and superintendent education programs of the university are approved by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).

DBU is also affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas.

=== Institute for Global Engagement ===
The Institute for Global Engagement was founded at DBU in 2015 to be &quot;a Christian, non-partisan think tank dedicated to addressing issues in the public square with biblical distinctiveness&quot; and to be &quot;a moral and spiritual catalyst for renewal in our culture.&quot; The goal of the institute is to be interdisciplinary in bringing together experts and practitioners from a variety of fields to address issues from a distinctively Christian worldview. Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, former UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen. Jim Mattis. The organization also produces &quot;The Daily Briefing&quot;, an email that goes out three times a week covering the news of the day with a Christian perspective.

=== Rankings and recognition ===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Dallas Baptist University 214th among &quot;National Universities&quot; in its 2017 college and university rankings.

==Traditions==
In its early years, Dallas Baptist University&#x27;s mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.

=== Cross Ring ===
The Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experiences at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.

===Mr. Patriot===
One of DBU&#x27;s longest-running traditions, stemming from when DBU&#x27;s mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant. This anticipated event, formerly named Mr. Big Chief from 1981 to 2018, allows male students to display their skills, humor, and creativity. The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear), and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title and has the right to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.

===Family events===
Family Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus. Notable events include the Family Softball Game, Movie on the Quad, and Art Show as well as a family service project. Families are invited to fellowship with their students as well as the university faculty and staff through community activities and other fun events.

=== Unity Walk ===
Beginning in 2017, DBU has held an annual Unity Walk on MLK Day, with the DBU community coming together to remember the world of Martin Luther King, Jr., and pray for the dream of a unified country to become a reality. In addition to the walk, a special speaker each year recites King&#x27;s famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Also during the day, students, faculty, and staff participate in the service projects in Dallas as a part of the national MLK Day of Service.

==Athletics==

Dallas Baptist University&#x27;s Patriot Athletic Department sponsors 15 intercollegiate athletics teams that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). DBU also sponsors cheerleading and beginning in the fall of 2010, ice hockey at the club levels. All teams compete at the NCAA Division II level and compete in the Lone Star Conference, with the exception of the baseball team, which is a member of the Division I Conference USA, which they joined in the 2014 season. Although the baseball team played as an independent for several years, they accepted an invitation to join the Western Athletic Conference for the 2013 season. DBU also sponsors six intercollegiate club sports. The Diamond Belles are also an active part of the Patriot Athletic Department, serving as an auxiliary group of the Athletic Department.

In 2021, the Women&#x27;s Golf team won the NCAA Division II National Championship.

The DBU Baseball Team continues to be a premier sport for the school, with the team returning to an NCAA Super Regionals for the second time in school history in 2021, falling to Virginia in Game 3. 
The Athletic Department also features a Christ-centered Patriot Discipleship program, entitled &quot;Champions for Christ,&quot; as well as the Athletic Department&#x27;s Global Missions Initiative with athletic mission trips to Guatemala, Northern England, Peru, and South Korea.

===Teams===
A member of the Lone Star Conference, Dallas Baptist University sponsors eight men&#x27;s and seven women&#x27;s teams in NCAA-sanctioned sports: DBU is also home to a debate team that competes within the International Public Debate Association (IPDA). The team began competing in the fall of 2021.

<doc id="1159575" wikidata="Q4635630" url="?curid=1159575" title="360-day calendar">
<text>The 360-day calendar is a method of measuring durations used in financial markets, in computer models, in ancient literature, and in prophetic literary genres. 

It is based on merging the three major calendar systems into one complex clock, with the 360-day year derived from the average year of the lunar and the solar: (365.2425 &quot;(solar)&quot; + 354.3829 &quot;(lunar)&quot;)/2 = 719.6254/2 = 359.8127 days, rounding to 360. 

A 360-day year consists of 12 months of 30 days each, so to derive such a calendar from the standard Gregorian calendar, certain days are skipped.

For example, the 27th of June (Gregorian calendar) would be the 4th of July in the USA.

==Ancient Calendars==

Ancient calendars around the world initially used a 360-day calendar.

===Rome===

According to Plutarch&#x27;s Parallel Lives Romans initially used a calendar which had 360 days, with varying length of months. However, Macrobius&#x27; Saturnalia and Censorinus&#x27; The Birthday Book, claim that the original Roman calendar had 304 days split into 10 months. 

===India===

The Rig Veda describes a calendar with twelve months and 360 days.

===Mesoamerica===

In the Mayan Long Count Calendar, the equivalent of the year, the tun, was 360 days.

===Egypt===
Ancient Egyptians also used a 360-day calendar. One myth tells of how the extra 5 days were added.


==Financial use==

A duration is calculated as an integral number of days between startdate A and enddate B. The difference in years, months and days are usually calculated separately:

: formula_1

There are several methods commonly available which differ in the way that they handle the cases where the months are not 30 days long, i.e. how they adjust dates:

; European method (30E/360)
: If either date A or B falls on the 31st of the month, that date will be changed to the 30th.
: Where date B falls on the last day of February, the actual date B will be used.
: All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days, but another source says that February has its actual number of days.
; US/NASD method (30US/360)
: If both date A and B fall on the last day of February, then date B will be changed to the 30th. 
: If date A falls on the 31st of a month or last day of February, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
: If date A falls on the 30th of a month after applying (2) above and date B falls on the 31st of a month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
: All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.
; ISDA method
: If date A falls on the 31st of a month, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
: If date A falls on the 30th of the month after applying the rule above, and date B falls on the 31st of the month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
: All months are considered to last 30 days except February which has its actual length. Any full year, however, always counts for 360 days.
; BMA/PSA method
: If date A falls on the 31st of a month or last day of February, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
: If date A falls on the 30th of the month after applying the rule above, and date B falls on the 31st of the month, then date B will be changed to the 30th.
: All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.
; Alternative European method (30E+/360)
: If date A falls on the 31st of a month, then date A will be changed to the 30th.
: If date B falls on the 31st of a month, then date B will be changed to the 1st of the following month.
: Where date B falls on the last day of February, the actual date B will be used.
: All months are considered to last 30 days and hence a full year has 360 days.

<doc id="1159588" wikidata="Q1433881" url="?curid=1159588" title="Productive forces">
<text>Productive forces, productive powers, or forces of production (German: &quot;Produktivkräfte&quot;) is a central idea in Marxism and historical materialism.

In Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels&#x27; own critique of political economy, it refers to the combination of the means of labor (tools, machinery, land, infrastructure, and so on) with human labour power. Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from Adam Smith&#x27;s reference to the &quot;productive powers of labour&quot; (see e.g. chapter 8 of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776)), although the German political economist Friedrich List also mentions the concept of &quot;productive powers&quot; in &quot;The National System of Political Economy&quot; (1841).

All those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers&#x27; cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human knowledge can also be a productive force.

Together with the social and technical relations of production, the productive forces constitute a historically specific mode of production.

== Labor ==
Karl Marx emphasized that with few exceptions means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a ghost town or capital depreciation due to strike action). Simultaneously, technological developments which serve as means of production would not exist without what Marx refers to as &quot;general intellect,&quot; the human innovation and industry which motivates industrial development.

Capital itself, being one of the factors of production, comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with &quot;a life of its own&quot;. Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls &quot;the capital relation&quot; as being summarised by the circumstance that &quot;capital buys labour&quot;, i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate &quot;things&quot; to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation.

The productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme reification.

Unlike British classical economics, Marxian economics classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production (&quot;not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things&quot;).

== Destructive forces ==
Marx and Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:

== Marxist–Leninist definition in the Soviet Union ==
The Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., textbook (1957, p xiv) says that &quot;[t]he productive forces reflect the &quot;relationship&quot; of people to the objects and forces of nature used for the production of material wealth.&quot; (italics added) While productive forces are a &quot;human&quot; activity, the concept of &quot;productive forces&quot; includes the concept that technology mediates the human-nature relationship. Productive forces do &quot;not&quot; include the subject of labor (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the means of production. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; &quot;means of production&quot; are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor. (Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., 1957, p xiii).

On the other hand, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969–1978) states:
According to this, productive forces have such structure:
* People (human labour power)
* Means (the material elements of the productive forces)
** Means of production
*** Means of labour
**** Instruments of labour
*** Objects of labour (also known as Subject of labour)
** Means of consumption

Marxism in USSR served as core philosophical paradigm or platform, and had been developing as a science. So different views, hypotheses and approaches were widely discussed, tested and refined with time.

== Reification of technology ==
Other interpretations, sometimes influenced by postmodernism and the concept of commodity fetishism have by contrast emphasized the reification of the powers of technology, said to occur by the separation of technique from the producers, and by falsely imputing human powers to technology as autonomous force, the effect being a perspective of inevitable and unstoppable technological progress operating beyond any human control, and impervious to human choices.

In turn, this is said to have the effect of naturalising and legitimating social arrangements produced by people, by asserting that they are technically inevitable. The error here seems to be that social relations between people are confused and conflated with technical relations between people and things, and object relations between things; but this error is said to be a spontaneous result of the operation of a universal market and the process of commercialization.

== Productivity ==
Marx&#x27;s concept of productive forces also has some relevance for discussions in economics about the meaning and measurement of productivity.

Modern economics theorises productivity in terms of the marginal product of the factors of production. Marx theorises productivity within the capitalist mode of production in terms of the social and technical relations of production, with the concept of the organic composition of capital and the value product. He suggests there is no completely neutral view of productivity possible; how productivity is defined depends on the values and interests people have. Thus, different social classes have different notions of productivity reflecting their own station in life, and giving rise to different notions of productive and unproductive labour.

== Chinese contexts ==
In 1984 Deng Xiaoping declared &quot;the fundamental task for the socialist stage is to develop the productive forces&quot;. For Deng &quot;only by constantly developing the productive forces can a country gradually become strong and prosperous, with a rising standard of living.&quot;

Deng Xiaoping in 1988 described science and technology as the primary productive force. This idea was incorporating into Deng Xiaoping Theory.

<text>Lathyrus pratensis or meadow vetchling, yellow pea, meadow pea and meadow pea-vine, is a perennial legume that grows to 1.2 m in height.

The hermaphrodite flowers are pollinated by bees. As a perennial, this plant reproduces itself over many years, spreading out from the point it was introduced, especially in damp grassy areas. This plant has been propagated in the past as animal fodder.

&quot;Lathyrus pratensis&quot; is also a host plant for ovipositioning of the wood white butterfly (&quot;Leptidea sinapis&quot;).

==Description==
Meadow vetchling is a perennial plant with a limp, unwinged stem that grows to and is erect and hairy. The leaves are alternate with short stalks and large stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with a single pair of broad lanceolate leaflets with blunt tips, entire margins and a terminal unbranched tendril. The inflorescence has a long stem and a cluster of five to twelve yellow flowers, each long. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the &quot;standard&quot;, the lateral two as the &quot;wings&quot; and the lowest two are joined to form the &quot;keel&quot;. There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long black pod. This plant flowers from June to August.
==Distribution and habitat==
Meadow vetchling is native to Europe and Asia, but has been introduced to other parts of the world. In the United States, this plant is found primarily in the northwestern states of Oregon and Alaska. Its typical habitat is rough grassy places, broad-leaved woodland, forest margins, hedgerows and banks where it uses its tendrils to clamber over other vegetation.

<doc id="1159619" wikidata="Q7446964" url="?curid=1159619" title="Seismic gap">
<text>A seismic gap is a segment of an active fault known to produce significant earthquakes that has not slipped in an unusually long time, compared with other segments along the same structure. There is a hypothesis or theory that states that over long periods, the displacement on any segment must be equal to that experienced by all the other parts of the fault. Any large and longstanding gap is, therefore, considered to be the fault segment most likely to suffer future earthquakes.

The applicability of this approach has been criticised by some seismologists, although earthquakes sometimes have occurred in previously identified seismic gaps.

==Examples==
===Loma Prieta Seismic Gap, California===
Prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake( = 6.9), that segment of the San Andreas Fault system recorded much less seismic activity than other parts of the fault. The main shock and aftershocks of the 1989 event occurred within the previous seismic gap.

===Central Kuril gap, Russia===
Immediately following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, a seismic gap analysis of the seismic zones around the Pacific Ocean identified the Central Kuril segment of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench subduction zone as the most likely to give rise to a major earthquake. This zone, 500 km in length, at that time had experienced no major earthquake since 1780, but was bounded to north and south by segments that had moved within the last 100 years. The Mw = 8.3 earthquake of 15 November 2006 and the = 8.2 earthquake of 13 January 2007 occurred within the defined gap.

===Central Himalayan Gap, India===
Although there had been earthquakes to the west (near Delhi) in 1905, and to the east (Nepal–India earthquake) in 1934, there was a 600-kilometer-long region of the central Himalayan that had not ruptured since 1505. In April 2015, the 7.8 April 2015 Nepal earthquake occurred near the center of this region.

===Cascadia, United States–Canada===

The only known damaging earthquakes to have occurred in the Cascadia subduction zone since the 1700 Cascadia earthquake are the 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake and 2001 Nisqually earthquake.

<doc id="1159624" wikidata="Q432980" url="?curid=1159624" title="Elihu Emory Jackson">
<text>Elihu Emory Jackson (November 3, 1837 – December 27, 1907), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 41st Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1888 to 1892. He was born in 1837 in Delmar, Maryland and died in 1907 in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried at the Parsons Cemetery in Salisbury, Maryland, the county seat of Wicomico County. He was part owner of Pemberton Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Governor Jackson is also known as having attended the ceremonies at Gettysburg Battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from the largest military battle on the North American continent in July 1863, dedicating several regimental and battle monuments for engagements participated in by the Union Army (United States Army), and even visiting some already erected and privately funded Confederate States Army monuments, and showing equanimity towards both sides with several regiments of Maryland troops in both armies, including regiments from the former pre-war State Militia. During the ceremonies and travels through the battlefield areas, he and his staff carried a revived Maryland state flag incorporating the shield from the coats-of-arms of the old colonial proprietary family of the Calverts and Crosslands, with both the black/gold chevrons of the paternal Calvert family and the red/white colors of the split bottony crosses (trefoil) of the maternal Crossland family. The ancestral parents of the first Lord Baltimore, Sir George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore (Lord Baltimore) who originally received the granting charter in 1632 from King Charles I of England for the new third English colony and Province of Maryland, which after his sudden death, was transferred to his eldest son and heir, Cecilius Calvert (the second Baron Baltimore and Lord Baltimore), who then became the first Lord Proprietor of the Colony while still living in England. It was he who sent the first two ships (the &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Dove&quot;) to the shores of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay with colonists who first briefly visited Virginia further south, then landed in March 1634, established the new capital St. Mary&#x27;s City, under his younger brother Leonard Calvert, as the first colonial governor.
By the end of the 19th century, carrying the old colonial armorial bearings from the shield emblazoned on a newly revived state flag, now seemed symbolic of the revival of reconciliation and sense of moving forward in the state so deeply torn asunder during the recent Civil War. There are several photographs of the Governor and his staff arrayed in front of several of the Maryland military monuments at Gettysburg, dressed in military uniforms and with the new state flag prominently posted alongside.
It was officially adopted in 1904 as the state flag by act of the General Assembly of Maryland in the historic 18th-century Maryland State House in the later state capital of Annapolis.

In his 2005 biography of poet Ogden Nash, Douglas M. Parker has written that &quot;Elihu Emory Jackson ... made a sizable fortune in the lumber business.&quot; The family, wrote Parker, were &quot;Southern Methodists and Southern sympathizers.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s granddaughter, Frances Leonard, was wed to Nash from 1931 to his death in 1971.

<doc id="1159658" wikidata="Q3544231" url="?curid=1159658" title="USS Spadefish (SS-411)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Spadefish&quot; (SS/AGSS-411), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the spadefish. Although she was commissioned late in the war and spent only one year in the Pacific war zone, she was able to run up a record of 88,091 tons in 21 ships and numerous trawlers sunk.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Spadefish&quot; was laid down on 27 May 1943 at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California. She was launched on 8 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Florence Scanland (&quot;née&quot; Boyd), wife of Commodore Francis W. Scanland, and was commissioned on 9 March 1944, Commander Gordon W. Underwood in command.

==Service history==
===First war patrol, July – September 1944===
Following shakedown training along the coast of California, &quot;Spadefish&quot; departed San Francisco on 14 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 June. On 23 July, she got underway from Pearl Harbor for her maiden war patrol, as a member of a coordinated attack group with and .

On 19 August, while patrolling in Philippine waters off the northwest coast of Luzon, &quot;Spadefish&quot; torpedoed and sank her first enemy target the 9,589-ton, passenger-cargo ship &quot;Tamatsu Maru&quot;. Three days later, she trailed three large tankers through Babuyan Channel along the northern Luzon coast; closed range; and fired two spreads of torpedoes, sinking the 10,023-ton tanker &quot;Hakko Maru No. 2&quot;, and damaging a second tanker that, protected by a destroyer, limped back to a shallow cove off Luzon.

For several hours into the next day, &quot;Spadefish&quot; attempted to get around the escort to attack the damaged ship anchored in the cove. The submarine finally let go with four stern torpedoes at the destroyer, but the enemy zigged clear and proceeded to depth charge the entire area. Having only three torpedoes remaining, &quot;Spadefish&quot; set course for Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, to replenish her supply.

On 8 September, &quot;Spadefish&quot; was patrolling in waters of Nansei Shoto when she contacted a convoy of eight cargo ships. During a daring night surface attack, she fired a total of 20 torpedoes, sinking cargo ships &quot;Nichiman Maru&quot;, &quot;Nichian Maru&quot;, &quot;Shinten Maru&quot;, and &quot;Shokei Maru&quot; and damaging another. The following morning, she fired her final four torpedoes at an escort guarding the stricken ship; but they ran under the target. The submarine&#x27;s only reward on this occasion was a rain of depth charges.

Although she was out of torpedoes, &quot;Spadefish&quot; continued to trail the remaining ships of the convoy that first took refuge in the harbor of Ishigaki; and then, in company with five escorts, continued their voyage. &quot;Spadefish&quot; terminated her first war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 24 September, having sunk six enemy ships for a total of over 31,500 tons. With the additional 33,000 tons sunk by her sister submarines, the coordinated attack group accounted for a total of 13 ships and over 64,000 tons of enemy shipping.

===Second war patrol, October – December 1944===

On 23 October, she got underway from Pearl Harbor for her second war patrol, in a coordinated attack group with and . While patrolling in the Yellow Sea on 14 November, she torpedoed and sank the Japanese cargo ship .

Three days later, she contacted an enemy convoy headed directly at her. After letting the convoy pass overhead, she surfaced after darkness had set in and commenced an &quot;end around&quot;. She first fired six torpedoes at the prime target, the 21,000-ton escort aircraft carrier ; and then turned rapidly to port and fired four stern torpedoes at a tanker. The unarmored fuel tanks of the escort carrier &quot;Shinyo&quot; exploded and started a huge fire that destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew. Only 70 men from her crew of 1,200 officers and men survived. Damage to the tanker could not be confirmed.

Later that same night, &quot;Spadefish&quot; drove in for another attack, firing four stern torpedoes at &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 156.&quot; As the enemy disappeared in the resulting explosion, the submarine quickly evaded other escorts and left the vicinity.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; sank the fourth ship of her second patrol on 29 November by torpedoing the 3,760-ton cargo ship &quot;Daiboshi Maru No. 6&quot;; and then concluded her patrol at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 12 December.

===Third war patrol, January – February 1945===
After spending the holidays at Majuro, &quot;Spadefish&quot; departed on 6 January 1945 for her third war patrol, conducted with , , and in the Yellow Sea. On the day of her departure, two United States Marine Corps SBD Dauntless dive bombers of Marine Scouting Squadron 245 (VMSB-245) mistook her for a Japanese submarine and dropped two depth charges on her after she submerged off Majuro. She suffered only superficial damage and no casualties, and she proceeded to her patrol area.

On 28 January 1945, &quot;Spadefish&quot; intercepted Japanese convoy and let go with two spreads of torpedoes. The 7,158-ton converted seaplane tender &quot;Sanuki Maru&quot;, exploded and quickly sank, and the frigate &quot;Kume&quot; spouted flames and began to sink slowly. Three Japanese escorts pounced on &quot;Spadefish&quot;, but she made her escape and continued her patrol.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; added to her score on 4 February by sinking the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Tairai Maru&quot;. Two days later, only five miles from Port Arthur, she blasted the 1,092-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shohei Maru&quot;, to the bottom. An enemy patrol airplane dropped a depth charge in the vicinity of the submarine; but, although she was rocked by the shock waves, &quot;Spadefish&quot; was unharmed and returned to Guam on 13 February.

===Fourth war patrol, March – April 1945===
On 15 March 1945, &quot;Spadefish&quot; departed Guam for her fourth war patrol, conducted in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea. On 21 March, an Allied aircraft mistakenly attacked, dropping a bomb that exploded as she submerged which exploded as she passed a depth of . She sustained no damage or casualties, but her crew found bomb fragments on her deck after she surfaced.

On 23 March 1945, &quot;Spadefish&quot; sneaked past four escorts and let go with three torpedoes that sank the 2,274-ton cargo ship &quot;Doryo Maru&quot;. &quot;Spadefish&quot; patrolled along the coast of Kyūshū, continuing north to Tsushima Strait, where she carried out reconnaissance to determine the presence of minefields. She demolished an enemy schooner off the coast of Korea on 1 April and gave the same treatment to a three-masted junk on 7 April. Two days later, she sank the cargo ship &quot;Lee Tung&quot;; and, on 11 April, damaged a minesweeper. She terminated her fourth patrol at Guam on 21 April 1945.

===Fifth war patrol, June – July 1945===

Equipped with a new mine-detecting device, she began her fifth war patrol, joining eight other United States submarines in penetrating through the minefields of Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. On 10 June, outside the breakwater of Tarukawa Wharf, &quot;Spadefish&quot; overtook the outbound passenger-cargo ship &quot;Daigen Maru No. 2&quot;, and blew the enemy ship apart with two torpedo hits. Before the day was over, the submarine had also sunk the passenger-cargo ships &quot;Unkai Maru No. 8&quot; and &quot;Jintsu Maru&quot;.

Before dawn on 12 June 1945, &quot;Spadefish&quot; sank a motor sampan with 20 mm fire; and, later in the day, sank three trawlers in gunfire attacks. On 13 June she mistakenly sank the Soviet merchant ship at in a friendly fire incident. On 14 June, she sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Seizan Maru&quot;; and, in a night attack on 17 June, she sank the C.M. minelayer &quot;Eijō Maru&quot;. She then rejoined the other submarines and exited the Sea of Japan, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 July 1945.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; was preparing for another war patrol when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945 (14 August across the International Date Line in Hawaii.

===Post-World War II===
&quot;Spadefish&quot; remained at Pearl Harbor until 2 September 1945 and then set course for Mare Island Naval Shipyard where she was decommissioned on 3 May 1946 and placed in reserve. She was reclassified an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-411, on 6 November 1962, struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1967, towed to New London, CT Submarine Base full of spare parts and later sold for scrap in 1969.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Spadefish&quot; (SS-411) received four battle stars for World War II service.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Spadefish&quot; is one of several submarines along with the era&#x27;s , , , and whose war patrols can be re-enacted in the 1985 MicroProse computer game &quot;Silent Service&quot; and the game&#x27;s various ports, including Konami&#x27;s 1989 release for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

In 2008 &quot;Spadefish&quot;″s ship&#x27;s flag and ship&#x27;s wheel were appraised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for an episode of the American television series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

<text>The Afan Forest Park (formally and locally known as Afan Argoed Country Park) is a forest park in Britain. It is set in the Afan Valley in Neath Port Talbot, in south Wales. It is well known for its mountain biking and hiking or hillwalking trails. It is situated seven miles (11 km) from Junction 40 of the M4 (the Port Talbot turn).

== Trails and waymarked walks ==

As the A4107 meanders through the steep sided valley it is easy to understand why this valley has been developed as a premier mountain bike riding venue in the United Kingdom. The Forest Park also has nine waymarked walking trails, ranging from a 30-minute amble to a 3-4 hour ramble. There are also miles of public rights of way. As well as mountain biking, there is also a network of of disused railway lines which are used for walking and cycling. These are called the Family Routes, or the Low Level Cycleway. These also form a link between the mountain bike trails.

The Forest Park Centre has camping facilities, with campsites with a shower block and toilet block which can also be used by other visitors. In addition to these basic facilities, the centre also has a café, small local museum on mining, bike shop and a gift shop.

===Kanji Wood===
In 2002, Afan Forest Park was officially twinned with the C.W.Nicol Woodland Trust in Kurohime in the Nagano prefecture of Japan. In Afan Forest Park, &#x27;Kanji Wood&#x27; was developed on three kanji characters; human, forest and life and landscaped with Japanese trees, shrubs and sculptures.

===Education and activities===

The Forest Park runs a schools program with its &quot;Education Ranger&quot; and also organises adult education from the study room at the Forest Park Centre, which is available for private groups. They also do an annual program of walks and activities and have a wildlife puzzle trail for families.

===Theatre Tymaen===
Developed in 2006, this is a 300-seat outdoor theatre for drama, music, art and workshops. It is available for hire.

===Mountain bike trails===
Penhydd Trail

The Penhydd trail was built by a group of enthusiasts from the local mountain bike club. It&#x27;s a 22 km loop. This trail was voted as the trail to ride before you die by &quot;What Mountain Bike Magazine&quot; in 2004.

The Wall Trail

With the success of the Penhydd Trail, the Forestry Commission saw how popular mountain biking was becoming so the Wall trail was built. This is a 24 km mainly single-track loop. The Graveyard section and the final descent of the Wall have been well reviewed.

White&#x27;s Level Trail

This is a 6 km single-track climb and downhill. There is usually transport available for downhill riders at weekends, from the Glyncorrwg Mountain Bike Centre. The whole trail is 15 km long and has recently been the focus of most new trail building activity. A new section, the NPower Renewables Energy Trail, was opened on 12 October 2007.

Skyline Trail

The newest trail in the valley. This is a 46 km long loop, sharing the same initial climb as White&#x27;s Level. It is known for the views from the horizon line. The Jetlag section is known for its high difficulty. There are also two &#x27;shortcuts&#x27; on the route for riders who are not ready to attempt the whole 46 km.

W2 Trail

This is a high level link that connects both The Wall and White&#x27;s Level.

===Accommodation===
Lists of places to stay in and around the park can be found at the Afan Forest Park website.

2015 Update: A new campsite has opened in Afan Forest Park called Willow Springs Campsite.

==Media==
Afan Forest park was named in the top ten places in the world to &quot;ride before you die&quot; by &quot;What Mountain Bike Magazine&quot;. Other destinations named included Whistler, Canada.

The high bridge in the park was used as a recurring filming location for the Channel 4/Netflix black comedy &quot;The End of the F***ing World&quot;.

==Forestry==
Large numbers of larch trees infected with &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot; have been felled, to be replaced by mixed species for timber production.

<text>Henry Lloyd (February 21, 1852 – December 30, 1920) was the 40th governor of Maryland in the United States from 1885 to 1888. He was born in 1852 in Dorchester County, Maryland and died in 1920 in Cambridge, Maryland. He was a grandson of Maryland Governor Edward Lloyd.

==Early life==
Henry Lloyd was born in Dorchester County, Maryland on February 21, 1852, the son of Daniel Lloyd and Kitty Henry Lloyd. He was descended from Edward Lloyd, who had served as Colonial Governor in 1709, and from Edward Lloyd V, the Governor in 1809. He was a descendant on his mother&#x27;s side of John Henry, the first United States Senator from the Eastern Shore and Governor between 1797 and 1798. He graduated from Cambridge Academy in 1871, then began his career by teaching school. He began the study of law in the office of his uncles Daniel Maynadier Henry, then Congressman from the Eastern Shore, and Judge Charles P. Goldsborough. He was admitted to the bar in 1873.

==Personal life==
On October 18, 1886, he married Mary Elizabeth Staplefort, and they had one son.

==Career==
In 1881, he was elected a member of the Maryland State Senate from Dorchester County, being elected its President in the Legislative Session of 1884. He then became the acting governor on March 27, 1885, when Robert M. McLane resigned to become Minister to France. He continued as such until January 1886, when the Legislature votes 100 of 114 ballots for him to be Governor. He was inaugurated on January 21, 1886, to serve until January 11, 1888.

Following his term as governor, Lloyd resumed his law practice in Cambridge, Maryland. He was then elected for the full 15-year term as an Associate Judge of the First Judicial Circuit in 1893.

==Death==
Lloyd died at his home in Cambridge on December 30, 1920. He is buried at the Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Cambridge.

<text>American World University (AWU) is an unaccredited institution offering post-secondary education programs by distance learning. It has no physical campus. It awards academic degrees. In January 2000 American World University offered &quot;all degrees&quot; for $1,000 as a &quot;New Years Special&quot;.

==History==
In 1990, Maxine Asher founded AWU, which operated out of a Rapid City, South Dakota, office until 2000, when an increase in Iowa standards for post-secondary institutions led it to relocate to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Asher herself was based in California and died in 2016.

, its current office address is 400 South Beverly Drive, Suite 214 in Beverly Hills, California.

==Criticism and controversy==
American World University is not accredited by any institutional accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. However, it is listed as &quot;accredited&quot; by the World Association of Universities and Colleges, an organization that is also run by Maxine Asher.

As part of its services, AWU claims to offer people the opportunity to earn college credits based life experience and work, and to take courses at home through distance education. However, some dispute AWU&#x27;s claim to provide legitimate academic services. John Bear, the author of &quot;Bears&#x27; Guide to Earning Degrees through Distance Learning&quot;, said of AWU, &quot;Academically, there&#x27;s nothing there.&quot;

In January, 2004, the State of Hawaii&#x27;s Office of Consumer Protection won a lawsuit against AWU; the judgment enjoined AWU from &quot;Providing any post-secondary instructional programs or courses leading to a degree&quot; or &quot;Acting as or holding themselves out as a &#x27;college&#x27;, &#x27;academy&#x27;, &#x27;institute&#x27;, &#x27;institution&#x27;, &#x27;university&#x27; or anything similar thereto.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Iowan&quot; describes AWU in depth in an article entitled &quot;Stealth U. in Iowa City duped many, experts say.&quot; According to the article, Michael Lambert, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.–based Distance Education and Training Council said Asher applied for accreditation for AWU to his organization in 1996. He said she complained about the requirements and the paperwork and challenged him to visit her in person. He recalls flying to Iowa City and meeting her in a few empty rooms that were the headquarters of AWU. After a 30-minute meeting, Asher withdrew the application for accreditation.

The same article related the experiences of a student named John Shaw, who he says he received specific assurances from Asher that the master&#x27;s degree he was seeking would be acknowledged in Saudi Arabia. When he applied for a job in that country, he was told that neither the degree nor the school were considered legitimate: &quot;In fact, they told me that I was wasting my time and money studying with that school.&quot;

In March 2004 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that a public official was criticized for possessing a doctorate from American World University. The article quoted John Bear as saying &quot;Academically, there&#x27;s nothing there,&quot; said Bear who noted &quot;I don&#x27;t call it a school, I call it a business.&quot;

As of 2006, the Los Angeles-area Better Business Bureau&#x27;s report on AWU gave it a D rating, apparently based on one complaint, which the BBB says AWU &quot;refuse[d] to adjust, relying on terms of agreement.&quot; The Mississippi Better Business Bureau, however, called AWU&#x27;s record &quot;satisfactory,&quot; again mentioning just a single complaint (presumably a different one) which, they judged, AWU had &quot;made every reasonable effort to resolve.&quot;

AWU granted Ph.D. diplomas to several people who later supported the university in its literature, including Dr. Adrian Waller (a former lecturer at Nihon University in Tokyo and Mishima, Japan,) and Dr. Bruce Rosen (former Asst. Professor, Computer Science, University of Texas–San Antonio). Hamzah Haz, Vice President of Indonesia, was reported to have obtained an internet PhD from AWU.

<doc id="1159679" wikidata="Q313429" url="?curid=1159679" title="Otto, Duke of Austria">
<text>Otto, known as the Merry (; 23 July 1301 – 17 February 1339), was Duke of Austria and Styria from 1330, as well as Duke of Carinthia from 1335 until his death. A member of the House of Habsburg, he ruled jointly with his elder brother Duke Albert II.

==Biography==
Otto was born in the Austrian capital, Vienna, the youngest son of King Albert I of Germany and Elizabeth of Carinthia, a member of the House of Gorizia-Tyrol (&quot;Meinhardiner&quot;). His elder brothers were Rudolf III, who became King of Bohemia in 1306, Frederick the Fair, elected King of the Romans in opposition to Louis the Bavarian in 1314, the Austrian dukes Leopold I and Albert II, as well as Henry the Friendly.

After the murder of King Albert I in 1308, the Habsburgs lost out in the struggle for the German throne, when Frederick the Fair was defeated by his Wittelsbach rival Louis in the 1322 Battle of Mühldorf. In the course of a rapprochement of both dynasties, Otto married Elizabeth of Wittelsbach, a daughter of Duke Stephen I of Bavaria. In 1327 he founded Neuberg Abbey in Styria, on the occasion of the birth of his first son Frederick II, and the Chapel of Saint George in the Augustinian Church in Vienna. When his wife Elizabeth died in 1330, she was buried at the Neuberg Abbey church.

From 1329 onwards, Otto administered the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia (Further Austria). In 1330, he and his brother Albert II were enfeoffed with the Austrian duchy. Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor since 1328, also vested Otto with the title of an Imperial vicar. In February he developed close ties with the mighty House of Luxembourg by secondly marrying Anna of Bohemia, daughter of King John the Blind and sister of future emperor Charles IV, in the Moravian royal city of Znojmo.

Two months later, Otto&#x27;s maternal uncle, the &quot;Meinhardiner&quot; duke Henry of Carinthia, died without male heirs, whereupon Emperor Louis IV on 2 May 1335 ceded the Duchy of Carinthia, the adjacent March of Carniola and the southern part of the Tyrol to Otto and Albert as Imperial fiefs in Linz. Otto was enthroned as duke in accordance with the archaic Carantanian rite on the Zollfeld plain, and, from that time onwards, took care of Carinthia rather than of the Austrian duchy. In 1337 he founded the knightly order &quot;Societas Templois&quot; for the crusade against the pagan Prussian and Lithuanian tribes. His nickname &quot;the Merry&quot; refers to the festive atmosphere at his court.

Otto died at Neuberg Abbey at the age of 37. His sons and titular successors Frederick II and Leopold II died shortly afterwards in 1344 (presumably poisoned), and the line became extinct.

==Marriages and children==

On 15 May 1325, Otto married his first wife Elizabeth of Bavaria. She was a daughter of Stephen I, Duke of Bavaria and Jutta of Schweidnitz. They had two children:
*Frederick II (10 February 1327 – 11 December 1344)
*Leopold II, Duke of Austria (1328 – 10 August 1344)

Elizabeth of Bavaria died on 25 March 1330. Otto remained a widower for almost five years. On 16 February 1335, Otto married his second wife Anna of Luxembourg, daughter of King John of Bohemia and his first wife Elizabeth, a member of the Přemyslid dynasty. They had no children. Anna died on 3 September 1338.

Otto also had four illegitimate sons who appear in genealogies. The identities of their mother or mothers and their later fates are unknown:
*Otto
*Leopold
*Johann
*Leopold

<text>David Stokes (born May 28, 1982, Dumfries, Virginia) is an American former professional soccer player, who last played three seasons in Major League Soccer and two in the USL First Division.

==Early life and education==
Stokes attended high school at C.D. Hylton High School in Woodbridge, Virginia where he won back to back Virginia AAA state championships. His high school team received a #1 national ranking in 1998. Stokes played club soccer for the Braddock Road Youth Club, where he won three Virginia State Cups and a USYSA National Championship in 1999. Stokes also won an indoor National Championship with Braddock Road. 

Stokes then played three years of college soccer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2000 to 2002. As a sophomore, Stokes was named Defensive MVP of the College Cup as he helped UNC to a national championship.

==Club career==
===Professional===
After finishing his junior season, Stokes signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. Hailed as the second-coming of Eddie Pope, Stokes was selected 5th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. Although Stokes&#x27; athleticism was clear, he did not receive the opportunity to play in regular season action during his rookie year. He did appear in U.S. Open Cup games for United, friendly matches (including a win against Blackburn Rovers) and made appearances on loan with the Virginia Beach Mariners. After Ray Hudson was released, many expected Stokes to play a larger role in Peter Nowak&#x27;s team. Stokes had a promising beginning to the 2005 season in which he saw action in the CONCACAF champions cup and began the MLS regular season in the starting eleven. A concussion sidelined Stokes in the early part of his campaign. After recovering from this, he had another setback after he suffered a harsh tackle resulting in cartilage damage in his left ankle. The injury required surgery and ended Stokes&#x27; &#x27;05 season. Stokes worked hard to recover earlier than expected and arrived fit to play in the &#x27;06 preseason, but 2 quadriceps tears sidelined Stokes once again until the late summer. Stokes worked his way back into the first team after reserve team appearances but did not receive much playing time in his last season with DC.

After his tenure with DC, Stokes overcame his injuries and signed with the Carolina Railhawks. He was able to return to school and continue to play as well. Stokes helped Carolina to back to back Southern Derby Cup championships and plans on graduating from UNC in the summer of 2009.

===International===
Stokes played for the United States under-23 men&#x27;s national soccer team in the qualification rounds, notching the game winning assist in the group phase play vs. Honduras which locked the team into first place going into the semi-final. This talented group failed to qualify, however, after losing to Mexico in Mexico in front of their crowd of 60,000+.

<text>Feodor Chaliapin Jr. (; 6 October 1905 – 17 September 1992) was a Russian-born actor who appeared in many American and Italian films.

==Life==

Chaliapin was the son and namesake of the great operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin. He was born in Moscow, Russian Empire, and had a distinguished career in acting throughout Europe, mainly in Italy. His mother was Iola Tornaghi, a ballerina who abandoned a promising ballet career to care for Feodor and his five siblings. When the Russian Revolution occurred in October 1917, the Chaliapins attempted to continue living in Russia, but this became impossible, especially after the Bolsheviks reputedly confiscated his wealthy father&#x27;s money and property. Along with many other Russian émigrés, part of the family emigrated to Paris in 1924, via Finland. The senior Chaliapin used this as his world base, like other émigrés and members of their families who often ended up living in the United States such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff and, for a while, Sergei Prokofiev.

Chaliapin grew up in a family that spoke three languages. He received an excellent education in Moscow and lived there until 1924, when he emigrated to Paris to be with his father, leaving behind his mother and the rest of the family. Chaliapin knew some of the greatest composers and conductors of the 20th century, particularly Rachmaninoff, a personal family friend and teacher of his father. Tired of living in his father&#x27;s shadow in Paris, Chaliapin struck out on his own, moving to Hollywood to begin his film career — first in silent movies, in which his then-heavy accent could not be heard in the small bit parts he played. In his later years, Chaliapin achieved international stardom in more major roles.

Chaliapin is perhaps most remembered by modern audiences for the film &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), in which he played the venerable blind abbot, Jorge de Burgos. He had a major role in &quot;Inferno&quot; (1980). One of his most memorable roles was Grandpa Castorini in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), starring Cher. The director, Norman Jewison, sought the advice of his friend Sean Connery in deciding whether to hire him for the role — the two having starred together in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; — who is reputed to have said: &quot;He canna see, he canna hear — but he will steal every scene in the film he&#x27;s in, he&#x27;s brilliant&quot;.
Chaliapin also played the role of Leonides Cox, Robert De Niro&#x27;s father in &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot; (1990). His last notable film role was as Professor Bartnev in &quot;The Inner Circle&quot; (1991), a true story about Soviet Russia under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin.

In one of his briefest roles, Chaliapin dies in the arms of Gary Cooper in the opening scenes of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1940 novel.

Of Chaliapin&#x27;s early film roles, one of the most memorable was in Victor Tourjansky&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner of the Volga&quot; (1959). Much of his filmography lies in Italian films, including an appearance as Julius Caesar in Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Roma&quot;.

Chaliapin was reunited with his mother, who then was 87 years old, in Rome in 1960. His mother&#x27;s emigration was helped by the reforms (the so-called &quot;thaw&quot;) of then Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev. The price of this was having to leave behind a museum-quality home and a magnificent art collection in Moscow as collected by Feodor Chaliapin Sr. The only objects of art permitted to leave Russia were photograph albums of Chaliapin&#x27;s childhood and youth in Moscow.

Mikhail Gorbachev, the last General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, instituted political and economic reforms known as &quot;perestroika&quot;. Under these reforms, Chaliapin was able to remove his father&#x27;s remains from Paris to Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. The grave is marked by a white marble statue of Chaliapin Sr.

In 1992, Chaliapin died of natural causes after an illness in Rome, where he had lived since World War II. He was survived by his twin sister, Tatiana Chaliapin Chernoff, and several nieces and nephews.

He is buried at the Cimitero Flaminio, Provincia di Roma, in Lazio, Italy.

<doc id="1159685" wikidata="Q886672" url="?curid=1159685" title="Robert Milligan McLane">
<text>Robert Milligan McLane (June 23, 1815 – April 16, 1898) was an American politician, military officer, and diplomat. He served as U.S. minister to Mexico, France, and China, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland&#x27;s 4th congressional district, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and as the 39th governor of Maryland.

== Early life and military career ==
McLane was born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1815, the son of Louis McLane and Catherine Mary Milligan. His birthplace, the Louis McLane House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. He received early education from a private school conducted by John Bullock, a Quaker. He received higher education from St. Mary&#x27;s College in Baltimore, Maryland until he moved with his family to Europe, after his father had been appointed as an ambassador to England. He was sent to Paris to receive further education from Collège Bourbon, where he became acquainted with the Marquis de Lafayette. His elder brother was Louis McLane, former president of Wells Fargo &amp; Co.

McLane and his family moved back to the United States in 1833 when his father was appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The same year, McLane was appointed as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point by President Andrew Jackson, and graduated in July 1837 with a commission as second lieutenant of Artillery in the United States Army. McLane was deployed with his regiment to Florida during the Seminole War in 1837 under the command of General Thomas S. Jesup, and in 1838 was re-deployed to the west under General Winfield Scott.

In 1838, he was transferred to the Corps of Topographical Engineers under General Zachary Taylor. In 1841, he was sent to the Northern Lakes for survey work and was also sent to Europe to examine the dikes and drainage systems in the Netherlands and Italy. While in Europe, he met his future wife, Georgine Urquhart, and eventually fathered two children with her. McLane resigned his commission in 1843 to pursue the study of law, and was admitted to the bar the same year. He commenced practice in Baltimore thereafter.

== Political and diplomatic career ==

=== Early political career and election to Congress ===
In 1845, McLane was elected as a representative of Baltimore City to the Maryland House of Delegates after successfully campaigning for President James K. Polk a year previous. In 1846, McLane ran for Congress and defeated his Whig opponent, John P. Kennedy, by 500 votes. He was re-elected two years later, and served from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1851. In Congress, McLane was seen as an exceptional orator, and, during his second term, was chosen as chairman of the Committee on Commerce. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1850. After his tenure in Congress, McLane moved to the Western United States to become a counsel for a mining corporation, which was engaged in legal activities regarding property in California. He remained out West until 1852, when he returned to Maryland to serve as presidential elector for Franklin Pierce.

=== Ambassador to China and Mexico ===
In 1853, during the Taiping Rebellion, President Pierce appointed McLane as commissioner to China, with the powers of a Minister Plenipotentiary, and at the same time accredited to Japan, Siam, Korea, and Cochin China. Despite the civil war, McLane was ordered to secure commercial relations between China and the United States, and was also ordered to negotiate with the rebels while also retaining diplomatic relations with the Imperial Government. He successfully renewed trade relations between both nations, but returned to the United States in 1854 due to poor health. After his return to the United States, he resumed his political activity by serving as delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1856, during which he supported future President James Buchanan.

The United States and Mexico had broken off diplomatic relations in 1858, after which civil war broke out in Mexico. McLane was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico on March 7, 1859, and was charged to determine if the government of Benito Juárez was worthy of recognition. He also negotiated, as ambassador, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty, which would have expanded the transit rights of the U.S. across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to include an interoceanic canal concession. However, the treaty was not ratified by the United States Senate. McLane retired as Ambassador to Mexico on December 22, 1860.

=== American Civil War and return to Congress ===
During the American Civil War, the federal government, under President Abraham Lincoln, forcibly forbade the state of Maryland from joining the Confederacy. McLane was a member of the delegation sent to Washington, D.C. to question the actions of the federal government. McLane personally believed that it did not have the constitutional right to force Maryland into submission but was determined, along with the rest of the delegation, that Maryland should not secede. During the rest of the war, McLane refocused his attention back towards his law practice, as he had been appointed counsel for the Western Pacific Railroad in the winter of 1863.

McLane would continue to devote his energies towards his law practice until well after the end of the Civil War and did not re-enter politics until the Democratic National Convention in 1876. He entered the Maryland State Senate in 1877, representing Baltimore City. He left the State Senate in 1879 to again run for election to Congress. He was successful, and served two terms from March 4, 1879, to March 3, 1883. During his first term in Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads.

McLane, according to Athen&#x27;s Post newspaper of 22 March 1861, drew page 1 notice when harangued the audience delighted to hear him, &quot;By the living God, the Susquehanna river will run red with blood...I pledge my life and heart to march with you... For what? To prevent a single human being from crossing into Maryland to execute the laws of the United States.&quot; Like many, McLane pumped up the crowds with hate and fear, lots of bravado, but those men who pumped up crowds that way did not actually do anything but get others to invade and kill, while they found ways to avoid actual battle.:

=== Governor of Maryland and Ambassador to France ===
In 1883, the Maryland Democratic Party nominated McLane to be the next Governor of Maryland. In the election, McLane handily defeated his Republican opponent, Hart Benton Holton, by 12,000 votes. During his tenure, several notable pieces of legislation were passed, including the establishment of the Bureau of Statistics and Labor Information, and the establishment of a universal time standard throughout the state. McLane only served as governor for slightly over a year, from January 8, 1884, until his resignation on March 27, 1885, having been appointed by President Grover Cleveland as United States Minister Plenipotentiary to France.

McLane moved to France with his wife, whom he had met there many years previously, to carry out his ambassadorial duties. He established permanent residence in Paris even after his tenure as ambassador expired in 1889, due to his wife&#x27;s declining health. His own health began to decline in 1891, culminating in 1898 when he died. His body was returned to Baltimore, and was interred at Greenmount Cemetery.

He was admitted as a hereditary member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Maryland in 1858 and later served as the president of the Maryland Society from 1885 to 1899. The Maryland State Oyster Police Force (“Oyster Navy”), later the State Fishery Force steamer , serving the state from 1884 to 1945 with a brief World War I period commissioned USS &quot;Governor R. M. McLane&quot; (SP-1328) was named in his honor.

<text>Miroslav &quot;Mika&quot; Antić (; 14 March 1932 – 24 June 1986) was a Serbian poet, film director, journalist and painter. He was a major figure of the Yugoslav Black Wave. He had six children.

==Biography==
He wrote poems, articles, dramas, movie and TV scripts and documentaries. As a film-maker, he was considered as a part of the &quot;Black Wave&quot; of Yugoslav film. His films, in particular &quot;Breakfast with the devil&quot; in which Antić criticized the double morality of the communists during Tito’s time, were forbidden and destroyed. They were rediscovered and restored in the end of the 1990s. He acted in several movies and was a painter.

In addition to poems about Romani people with whom he identified (despite being of Serbian ancestry), because of his bohemian lifestyle, and the long poem on Vojvodina published as a separate book, he is especially well known for much recited at poetry gatherings and competitions poems about teenagers &quot;Plavi čuperak&quot; (A Blond Lock of Hair).

His oldest son, Igor, is a visual artist.

<doc id="1159689" wikidata="Q755196" url="?curid=1159689" title="Athena (band)">
<text>Athena is a rock/ska band from Istanbul, Turkey, founded by twin brothers Hakan Özoğuz (guitar and backing vocals) and Gökhan Özoğuz (lead vocals and guitar) in 1987. It is regarded as one of the best Turkish rock groups by many listeners. They have released 8 albums and featured as the Turkish entry to the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;For Real&quot;, finishing fourth.

== Band history ==

=== Foundation and rise in popularity (1997–2000) ===
Athena (ah-T&#x27;hěn-ah) was formed by twin brothers Gökhan Özoğuz and Hakan Özoğuz as a thrash metal band in 1987. After an unsuccessful first album, they switched their style to ska punk sometime later. Athena released their second album &quot;Holigan&quot; in 1998. The distinct ska sound of the album was welcomed by the local record buying public so much so that the title song &quot;Holigan&quot; was adopted as a march by football supporters of all ages at the stadiums. The album hit various Turkish charts and stayed at the top for a considerable amount of time. Shortly after releasing &quot;Holigan&quot;, Athena did a large scale tour of Turkey. One of the significant moments of the tour was their show at Açikhava Tiyatrosu in Istanbul. They later opened for Rolling Stones at a concert at Ali Sami Yen Stadium, then home to the Turkish football club Galatasaray.

Athena was the face of Turkey as part of the Millennium Concert at Taksim Square in Istanbul on the first night of 2000. The said concert was broadcast live by the Turkish channel NTV. They were later invited to the Popkomm Festival held in Köln, Germany where they performed with the Beastie Boys.

Their third album “Tam Zamanı Şimdi” was released in 2000 and the first single &quot;Yaşamak Var Ya&quot; was an instant hit in Turkey. The album sales reached gold status in an extremely short time. Their tour was sold out as a result of their exploding popularity. They performed a series of concerts in Germany pairing up with the German ska band The Fritz. After the tour, their song &quot;Devam Boşver&quot; was included in the album &quot;World of Ska Volume 11&quot;, released in Europe by the ska label Pork Pie Records. They later recorded the song &quot;Oniki Dev Adam&quot; (12 Giant Men) for the Turkish national basketball team. The Turkish team finished runner-up in the EuroBasket 2001 and many European newspapers commented that the song, sung by the team’s supporters during the games, led the team play better.

In January 2002, Athena’s fourth album &quot;Her Şey Yolunda&quot; was released. Two songs from this album, &quot;Öpücük&quot; and &quot;Beyoğlu&quot; were major hits. In 2003 Athena became part of an anti-war movement against the Iraqi war and contributed to the collaborative song &quot;Savaşa Hiç Gerek Yok&quot; (No Need for War), performing with many other musicians. Athena was the guest group at the huge dance show directed by Beyhan Murphy for Turkish Opera and Ballet. They also headlined the H2000 Festival June 2003 with Starsailor. Athena were among the headliners of the Rock&#x27;n Coke Festival of 2003 together with such acts as Pet Shop Boys, The Cardigans, Suede, Simple Minds, Sugababes, Dirty Vegas. 

=== Eurovision entry, release of 5th self-titled album (2000–present) ===
On May 15, 2004, Athena represented Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;For Real&quot;. In an unprecedented result, the ska band finished 4th in the contest. After Eurovision, their maxi single &quot;For Real&quot; was released in Germany and Greece. Athena’s first concert after the Eurovision Song Contest was the European – Turkish Festival in Berlin which was broadcast live on TRT (Turkish National TV). After the concert, and already popular in Germany, Athena was a guest on TV Total, a popular German talk show where they performed live.

In June 2004 Athena’s new album &quot;US&quot; was released in Turkey. With the release of their fifth self-titled album, &quot;Athena&quot; in 2005, their sound showed signs of change once more, with the band experimenting with an alternative rock sound this time. In 2010 the band released the album &quot;Pis,&quot; which followed this change in style. In 2005, the song &quot;Tam Zamani Simdi&quot; was featured on the FIFA 06 soundtrack.

In 2011, Athena recorded a cover of &quot;My Way&quot;, one of Frank Sinastra&#x27;s most popular songs in honor of Coca Cola&#x27;s 125th anniversary with Gökhan Özoğuz being the lead songwriter of the Turkish version of the song &quot;Ben Böyleyim&quot;. 

Gökhan and Hakan Özoğuz were among the four jury members of the third season of the reality television singing competition ‘O Ses Türkiye’ aired by TV8 (the Turkish version of the television show &quot;The Voice&quot;).

In 2014, Athena released an album named &quot;Altüst&quot;. The most controversial song in that album is “Ses Etme” because of the music video which published in 2016. The music video features the day of a transgender woman. Athena criticized the prejudice against transgender people and the hate crime in this song.

<doc id="1159702" wikidata="Q447059" url="?curid=1159702" title="Dulce María Loynaz">
<text>Dulce María Loynaz Muñoz (Havana, Cuba; 10 December 1902 – 27 April 1997) was a Cuban poet, and is considered one of the principal figures of Cuban literature. She was awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize in 1992. She earned her Doctorate in Civil Law at University of Havana in 1927.

==Early life==
Dulce María Loynaz was the daughter of the famous General Enrique Loynaz del Castillo, a hero of the Cuban Liberation Army and author of the lyrics of the march theme, &quot;El Himno Invasor&quot;, and sister of poet Enrique Loynaz Muñoz. Dulce María was born in Havana, Cuba on December 10, 1902, to a family of great sensibility towards artistic and cultural manifestations and deep patriotic feelings. Homeschooled as a child, Loynaz grew up in a familiar environment highly propitious for poetry.

Although Loynaz had a sheltered childhood, her early adulthood was much more adventurous, including experiences available at that time only to wealthy young women, even outside of Cuba. She published a number of poems in her teens and twenties.

=== Education ===
She completed the Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Havana in 1927, but rarely practiced law, and stopped practicing altogether in 1961 out of dislike. She was able to travel widely. In addition, her talents and her family&#x27;s social position brought her into personal contact with some of the major Spanish-language authors of the century, including Spanish author Federico García Lorca, Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1945, Cuban author Alejo Carpentier, and the Spanish writer Juan Ramón Jiménez who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1956.

== Publications and poetry ==
Loynaz published her first poems in &quot;La Nación&quot; in 1920. She traveled extensively including to Turkey, Syria, Libya, Palestine, and Egypt. Loynaz also visited Mexico in 1937 and various countries in South America from 1946 to 1947, and the Canary Islands in 1947 and 1951 where she as declared adoptive daughter.

Loynaz began writing &quot;Jardin&quot; in 1928 and completed the novel in 1935, shortly after Cuban women obtained the right to vote. During these early decades of the twentieth century, a time of great feminist activity, a dynamic and effective women&#x27;s movement flourished in Cuba, and women&#x27;s rights became part of the Cuban political consciousness. The feminist attitude Loynaz displays in &quot;Jardin&quot; is tied strongly to the image of the city. The novel begins and ends with the heroine looking out from the garden toward a city that resembles Havana.

In 1950, she published weekly chronicles at different publications of the epoch such as &quot;El País&quot;, &quot;Excélsior&quot;, &quot;Social&quot;, &quot;Grafos&quot;, &quot;Diario de la Marina&quot;, &quot;El Mundo&quot;, &quot;Revista Cubana&quot;, &quot;Revista Bimestre Cubana&quot; and &quot;Orígenes&quot;. In 1953, she attended as the university&#x27;s guest, celebrations that marked the 700th year since the naming of Salamanca University.

Her book &quot;Poemas sin nombre&quot; (Untitled Poems) was translated to Italian in 1955. She participated in conferences and readings, not only in Cuba but also in Spain and Latin America. She was elected as a member of the Arts and Literature National Academy in 1951, of the Cuban Academy of Language in 1959 and the Spanish Royal Academy of Language in 1968.

The Royal Academy of Spanish Language nominated her for the Miguel de Cervantes Prize in 1984. In 1985, &quot;Poesías Escogidas&quot; (Selected Poems) and Bestarium (a book of poems written before 1959) were published in Havana. During these years, she participated in conferences, gave speeches, and received prizes and awards bestowed by different Cuban cultural institutions.

She was awarded the King Alfonso X the Wise Order and on November 5, 1992, the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, an honorable distinction she received in Spain in 1992 from King Juan Carlos I&#x27;s hands. This is considered the Nobel prize in the world of the Spanish literature.

In 1959 she voluntarily stopped writing and publishing in Cuba. In a situation such as Cuba&#x27;s over the past 40 years, it is not surprising that a person as private in temperament as Dulce María Loynaz would seclude herself, or that her public statements have always been extremely discreet, patriotic, and yet non-political. More perplexing is the fact that, according to all her closest friends, she entirely stopped writing poetry when the Revolution triumphed in 1959. Although her work was characterized by so many of her friends as a private vocation, perhaps the total disappearance of the social world which fostered it, silenced her.

The discovery of her work by a large and enthusiastic audience in her home country when she was in her 80s, really for the first time and after more than 25 years of internal exile, must have been like the return of the dove in her poem, “Noah,” carrying the green branch that signifies a safe harbor. &quot;Fe de vida&quot; (Life&#x27;s Faith), her last work, saw the light in 1993, while celebrating in Pinar del Río, the First Ibero American Meeting about her work and life. Furthermore, some texts from her delicate creation have been adapted into music by different singers and songwriters.

She received several awards among them: National Order of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, Order of Félix Varela of the Culture, National Culture Distinctive Award, the Alejo Carpentier Medal (Cuba), and The Civil Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1947. She was awarded the Cuban National Prize for Literature (1987).

<doc id="1159705" wikidata="Q15466" url="?curid=1159705" title="William T. Hamilton">
<text>William Thomas Hamilton (September 8, 1820October 26, 1888), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 38th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1880 to 1884. He also served in the United States Senate, representing the State of Maryland, from 1868 to 1874, and in the House of Representatives, representing the second district (1849–1853) and fourth district (1853–1855) of Maryland.

==Early life and politics==
Hamilton was born in Boonsboro, Maryland, and received early schooling from a local tutor named John Brown. He went on to attend Hagerstown Academy, and later Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, from 1836 to 1840. After college, Hamilton studied law with former Maryland Congressman John Thomson Mason, Jr., and was admitted to the bar in 1845. He then commenced law practice in Hagerstown, Maryland.

In 1846, Hamilton was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, but failed to win re-election in 1847. He was, however, elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-first, Thirty-second, and Thirty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849 – March 3, 1855. While Hamilton was in Congress, even though his district was largely manufacturers and miners, he supported tariffs but only as a source of revenue for the government. Other actions while in Congress included his tenure as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia during the Thirty-third Congress.

From 1855 until 1868, Hamilton avoided politics and resumed the practice of law and farming in Hagerstown. During that time, he became widely known throughout Western Maryland as an excellent trial lawyer.

William Hamilton owned slaves and had a slaves quarters in his home in Hagerstown, Maryland.

==United States Senate==
After his long absence from politics, Hamilton was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate by the General Assembly, and served from March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1875. Hamilton was a strong supporter of restoring southern sovereignty following the American Civil War, and voted against the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which granted voting rights to all men regardless of race.

In 1871, Hamilton endorsed William Pinkney Whyte during the Maryland governor campaign, but regretted the decision thereafter following Whyte&#x27;s actions as governor. In 1874, Hamilton was abandoned by the state Democratic Party during the nomination process for his senate seat, and was not considered by them for re-election. Instead, Hamilton ran for governor in 1875, but lost his party&#x27;s nomination to fellow Democrat John Lee Carroll.

==Governor of Maryland==
After failing to receive nomination for governor, Hamilton again stepped away from the political arena, returning to his previous engagements in Western Maryland. During that time, however, he continued to push persistently for a Democratic nomination as governor of Maryland, which he succeeding in doing in 1879. Hamilton faced future U.S. Postmaster General, Republican James Albert Gary, during the election, and defeated him by more than 22,000 votes.

As governor, Hamilton regularly conflicted with the state legislature, believing they were neglecting the state&#x27;s economy. He sought to reduce government waste by abolishing excessive offices and positions, such as the office of Weighers of Grain and Hay, but again the legislature refused to cooperate with his program. He retired as governor on January 8, 1884, retaining popular support throughout the state. His hostile treatment of the legislature as governor, however, had made the state Democratic party again unreceptive towards him.

Hamilton returned to Hagerstown where he avoided further involvement in state and national politics. He returned to the practice of law, but also worked to improve the city and county public works, streets, and water supply. He was maintained a great deal of popularity in Hagerstown and the surrounding areas, and his death following a long battle with illness was widely mourned. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery (Maryland).

==Family==
Hamilton&#x27;s daughter Josephine married the inventor Hiram Percy Maxim. His other daughter Clare married Hayden Eames, brother of the opera singer Emma Eames. His granddaughter was actress Clare Eames, his great-granddaughter is actress Jennifer Howard, and his great-great-grandson is actor Tony Goldwyn.

<text>Popsicle is a Good Humor-Breyers brand of ice pop consisting of flavored, colored ice on a stick.

==History== 
=== 1905–1925: Frank Epperson ===
In 1905 in Oakland, California, 11-year-old Francis William &quot;Frank&quot; Epperson was mixing a powdered flavoring for soft drinks with water. He accidentally left it on the back porch overnight, with a stirring stick still in it. That night, the temperature dropped below freezing, and the next morning, Epperson discovered the drink had frozen to the stick, inspiring the idea of a fruit-flavored &quot;popsicle&quot;.

In 1922, he introduced the creation at a fireman&#x27;s ball, where according to reports it was &quot;a sensation&quot;. In 1923, Epperson began selling the frozen pops to the public at Neptune Beach, an amusement park in Alameda, California. By 1924 Epperson had received a patent for his &quot;frozen confectionery&quot; which he called &quot;the Epsicle ice pop&quot;. He renamed it Popsicle, supposedly at the insistence of his children. Popsicles were originally sold in fruity flavors and marketed as a &quot;frozen drink on a stick.&quot;

Six months after receiving a patent for the Popsicle, Good Humor sued Popsicle Corporation. By October 1925, the parties settled out of court. Popsicle agreed to pay Good Humor a license fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.

=== 1925–1965: Joe Lowe Company ===
In 1925, Epperson sold the rights to the Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company of New York, who set up a subsidiary called Popsicle Industries to sell the product. &quot;I was flat and had to liquidate all my assets,&quot; he recalled years later. &quot;I haven&#x27;t been the same since.&quot;

=== 1965–1987: Consolidated Foods ===
In 1965, Popsicle Industries was sold to Consolidated Foods Corporation (later renamed ‘Sara Lee’). 

=== 1986–1993: Split ownership ===
By 1986, Sara Lee was struggling to bring Popsicle to profitability, so the company sold the U.S. operations of Popsicle Industries to the Gold Bond Ice Cream Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

In 1987, Sara Lee sold the Canadian operations of Popsicle Industries to AmBrit Inc. In 1990, Empire of Carolina bought the Canadian operations of Popsicle Industries from Ambrit Inc.

=== Since 1989: Unilever ===
In 1989, Good Humor, now a subsidiary of Unilever, bought the U.S. rights to the Popsicle brand from Gold Bond and folded the U.S. operations of Popsicle Industries into its Good Humor-Breyers division.

In 1993, Unilever bought the corporate assets of Isaley Klondike from Empire of Carolina, which included the Klondike bar brand and the Canadian operations of Popsicle Industries. This re-united the Popsicle brand for the Canadian and U.S. markets under the Good Humor-Breyers division.

==Popsicle Pete==
In April 1939, a company mascot called Popsicle Pete was introduced on the radio program &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; as having won the &quot;Typical American Boy Contest&quot;. The character told listeners that they could win presents by sending wrappers from Popsicle products to the manufacturer. Pete continued to appear in the company&#x27;s U.S. advertising campaigns until the 1989 acquisition by Good Humor. During the 1940s, Popsicle Pete ads were created by Woody Gelman and his partner Ben Solomon, and appeared on Popsicle brand packages for decades.

The mascot was then introduced in Canada in 1988 and featured in television commercials, promotions, and print advertisements until 1996.

==Products==

The Popsicle brand began expanding from its original flavors after being purchased by Good Humor-Breyers in 1989. Under the Popsicle brand, Good Humor-Breyers holds the trademark for both Creamsicle and Fudgsicle. Creamsicle&#x27;s center is vanilla ice cream, covered by a layer of flavored ice. Fudgsicle, originally sold as Fudgicle, is a flat, frozen dessert that comes on a stick and is chocolate-flavored with a texture somewhat similar to ice cream.

Firecrackers are a brand of Popsicles that come in a shape resembling a firecracker (the top being red (cherry), the middle white (white lemon), and the bottom blue (blue raspberry)). These have a similar appearance to Wells Dairy&#x27;s Blue Bunny&#x27;s Bomb Pop. Slow Melt Pops include a small amount of gelatin that helps them stay frozen longer than traditional ice pops. Slow Melt Pops are available in several varieties.

Yosicles are a brand of Popsicle that contain yogurt. Revello Bars are chocolate covered ice cream on a stick.

Fruit Twisters are a brand of Popsicle that have fruit juice, milk and cane sugar.

<doc id="1159715" wikidata="Q911994" url="?curid=1159715" title="Brian Carroll">
<text>Brian Carroll (born July 20, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a defensive midfielder, notably appearing for D.C. United Columbus Crew and Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer. He is the only player in MLS history to have won four consecutive Supporter Shields.

==Youth and college career==
While in high school, Carroll was the &quot;Washington Post&quot; All-Met Player of the Year, was twice named to the &quot;Parade&quot; All-American team, and led the West Springfield Spartans to the final of the Virginia state tournament in 1998. He played college soccer at Wake Forest University from 2000 to 2002. Named captain as a sophomore, Carroll tied the school record for most assists in a game with three and finished the year as a second-team All-ACC selection. As a junior, he was again team captain, an All-American, and was a finalist for the Hermann Trophy. After his junior year, he signed a Project-40 contract with MLS, completing his career at Wake Forest with 7 goals and 15 assists, having started all 61 games over the three years.

==Club career==
===D.C. United===
Carroll was selected 11th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. Unfortunately for him, coach Ray Hudson preferred a lineup dominated by veterans, and although he saw time in U.S. Open Cup competition, Carroll did not appear in any regular season games. Peter Nowak replaced Hudson following the 2003 season, and soon expressed incredulity that a player as talented as Carroll saw no playing time under Hudson. Carroll was a fixture in Nowak&#x27;s lineup for the first game of the 2004 season, and would remain there all year long, appearing in all 30 of the team&#x27;s games, starting 26 of them, earning his first MLS assist, and winning the MLS Cup. In 2005, he led the team in minutes and games played, scored his first league goal, added three more assists, and led MLS in consecutive games played, at 62. Carroll was one of three players nominated for the 2005 MLS Fair Play Award. Carroll started 31 games for the club in 2006, with 1 goal and 3 assists. Carroll lost his starting role with United to fellow defensive midfielder Clyde Simms midway through the 2007 season, but still had a productive year, with 4 assists to his credit.
It was announced on 27 November 2006 that Carroll was on trial with French club Olympique de Marseille with hopes for an eventual transfer. However, on 23 January 2007 it was announced that Carroll had re-signed with D.C. United.

===Columbus Crew===
On November 21, 2007, Carroll was selected as part of the expansion draft to join the new San Jose Earthquakes club. On November 26, he was traded to the Columbus Crew in exchange for Kei Kamara.

In June 2010, Caroll signed a four-year contract extension with the Crew. On November 6, 2010, he missed the penalty which ended the Crew&#x27;s playoff run, sending the ball over the crossbar.

===Philadelphia Union===
On November 22, 2010, Carroll was traded to Philadelphia Union in exchange for a second-round draft pick and allocation money.

Between 2004 and 2016 he made at least 21 appearances for 13 different seasons. Upon retirement he was praised for his professionalism and leadership.

==International career==
Carroll played on the Under-18, Under-20, and Under-23 national teams, including at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina and 2003 Olympic Qualifying. In his first game for the full national team (a World Cup qualifier vs. Panama on October 12, 2005), he was named Man of the Match. He ended his career with eight caps.

==Personal life==
Carroll is the brother of fellow former professional soccer players Jeff Carroll and Pat Carroll, both of whom have also played for D.C. United. He is a lifelong Catholic whose soccer career has been influenced by former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.

Following retirement Carroll was planning to move to the Indianapolis area to pursue a career in financial planning.

<doc id="1159719" wikidata="Q339631" url="?curid=1159719" title="Fred W. Friendly">
<text>Fred W. Friendly (born Ferdinand Friendly Wachenheimer, October 30, 1915 – March 3, 1998) was a president of CBS News and the creator, along with Edward R. Murrow, of the documentary television program &quot;See It Now&quot;. He originated the concept of public-access television cable TV channels.

==Early career==
Friendly was born to a Jewish family in New York City to Therese Friendly Wachenheimer and Samuel Wachenheimer, a jewelry manufacturer. The family moved from Manhattan&#x27;s Morningside Heights district (where later, Friendly would teach for a quarter-century) to Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated from Hope Street High School in 1933. He received an associate&#x27;s degree from Nichols Junior College in 1936.

He entered radio broadcasting in 1937 at WEAN in Providence, Rhode Island, where he reversed the order of his middle and last names, and began using Friendly as his last name. In World War II, he served as an instructor in the Army Signal Corps and reported for an Army newspaper in the Pacific Theater (&quot;The CBI Roundup&quot;) before mustering out as a master sergeant in 1945. His decorations included the Legion of Merit and the Soldier&#x27;s Medal.

By the late 1940s, Friendly was an experienced radio producer. It was in this role that Friendly first worked with Murrow on the Columbia Records historical albums, &quot;I Can Hear It Now&quot;. The first entry in the series, released on Thanksgiving Day 1948, covered the crisis and war years 1933–1945. It was a ground-breaker in that it used clips of radio news coverage and speeches of the major events from that twelve-year time span. Friendly created the concept after noticing the new use of audiotape in regular radio news coverage, as opposed to wire or disc recordings that had been an industry standard. Periodically, Friendly created recordings of news events when such recordings didn&#x27;t exist or, recreated ones that were considered too chaotic to use on an album . CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun, in his memoir &quot;On and Off the Air&quot;, said he once was forced by Friendly to ask Charles de Gaulle if he would recreate the speech he gave upon his return to Paris (de Gaulle refused). The recreations never were identified as such, and trying to separate the real from the recreated, continues to be problematic for radio historians.

Although Murrow was an established CBS name and at the time Columbia Records was owned by CBS, Friendly&#x27;s next full-time work came as a news producer at NBC. It was there that Friendly originated the idea for the news-oriented quiz show &quot;Who Said That?&quot;, first hosted by NBC newsman Robert Trout, followed by Walter Kiernan, and John Charles Daly. The program, which Friendly edited, ran irregularly on NBC and then ABC between 1948 and 1955.

Friendly later wrote, directed, and produced the NBC Radio series &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; during the Summer of 1950. It was about the development of the atomic bomb. It featured Trout, Bob Hope, and &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Bill Laurence, who had won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Manhattan Project.

==CBS years==
After the success of &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;, Friendly was recruited to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums—a weekly show called &quot;Hear It Now&quot; that was hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as &quot;See It Now&quot; on Sunday, November 18, 1951.

Murrow and Friendly broadcast a revealing &quot;See It Now&quot; documentary analysis on Senator Joseph McCarthy (airing March 9, 1954) that has been credited with changing the public view of McCarthy and, being a key event leading to McCarthy&#x27;s fall from power. It was an extension of the duo&#x27;s continuing probe of the conflict between McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Communist crusade and individual rights.

The previous fall, Murrow and Friendly had produced a notable &quot;See It Now&quot; episode on the topic, when the show probed the case of Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Milo Radulovich, who had lost his security clearance because of the supposed leftist leanings of his sister and father—evidence the Air Force kept sealed. Five weeks later, Radulovich was reinstated by the secretary of the Air Force. Radulovich was granted leave of his duties that same year, however, when he was forced to move temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a dog mauling incident.

After &quot;See It Now&quot; ended, in the Summer of 1958, Friendly and Murrow worked together on its successor, &quot;CBS Reports&quot;, although Friendly alone was executive producer and Murrow no more than an occasional reporter and narrator. Their most famous &quot;CBS Reports&quot; installment—the probe of migrant farm workers &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot;—aired in November 1960 and still is considered one of television&#x27;s finest single programs.

After Murrow&#x27;s departure from the television network in 1961, Friendly continued to oversee several notable &quot;CBS Reports&quot; documentaries, including &quot;Who Speaks for Birmingham?&quot;, &quot;Birth Control and the Law&quot;, and &quot;The Business of Heroin&quot;.

Under CBS president James T. Aubrey Jr. the pressures on CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly fought with Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, &quot;Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control&quot;, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman William S. Paley supported the news, however, and protected Friendly&#x27;s division from Aubrey&#x27;s proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered that there would be fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly&#x27;s relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired.

Friendly served as president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966.

===CBS resignation===
In 1966, Friendly resigned from CBS when the television network ran a scheduled episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; instead of broadcasting live coverage of the first United States Senate hearings questioning American involvement in Vietnam. Onetime CBS News president Dick Salant, the executive who preceded and later succeeded Friendly in the role, wrote in his memoirs that Friendly&#x27;s problem was compounded by his inability to make such a request directly to the top CBS management (William S. Paley and Frank Stanton), as previous CBS News presidents had. In this case, Friendly had to go through a new supervisor at the executive level, CBS Broadcast Group president Jack Schneider.

==Later career==
After he left CBS, Friendly initially worked as a broadcast consultant at the Ford Foundation, a position he maintained until 1980. In this capacity, he initially developed an infeasible plan to allocate revenue generated by communications satellites toward the nascent medium of public television before he emerged as an integral figure in &quot;negotiations about interconnection that would lead to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in 1969.&quot; By ensuring National Educational Television&#x27;s subordination to the Washington-based PBS through the merger of NET with New York City&#x27;s WNDT (and including a $2 million Ford Foundation grant to bolster the station&#x27;s local programming), Friendly reluctantly placated members of the Nixon administration who perceived NET as a propagandistic front for the Eastern Establishment.

Despite his relative dearth of formal education—not atypical among contemporaneous practitioners—he was appointed to the tenured faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism as the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Broadcast Journalism in 1966.

Over the next thirteen years, Friendly assumed stewardship of the school&#x27;s hitherto threadbare broadcast journalism concentration. To the chagrin of some of his colleagues, he often eclipsed other top administrators (including 1970s-era dean Elie Abel, who was personally recommended by Friendly for the post) in the popular consciousness. The non-degree Summer Program in Journalism for Members of Minority Groups (renamed the Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists following the death of a distinguished alumna in a December 1972 airplane crash) was directed by Friendly from 1968 to 1975, enabling many individuals (most notably media-savvy attorney Geraldo Rivera) to switch careers during the tempestuous epoch. A proposed &quot;University Broadcast Laboratory&quot; (an experimental Sunday news magazine initially proposed by Friendly in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Columbia, and NET) only manifested in attenuated form, however, as &quot;Public Broadcast Laboratory&quot; from 1967 to 1969; administrative and content circumscriptions imposed by the University trustees precipitated his divestiture from the program and hastened the retirement of Journalism School dean Edward W. Barrett in 1968. As chair of Mayor John Lindsay&#x27;s Task Force on CATV and Telecommunications that year, Friendly revived his revenue-sharing proposal by advising cable companies to set aside two channels that the public could lease for a minor fee, ultimately enabling the development of public-access television.

Spurred by classroom discussions, he inaugurated the Media and Society Friendly Seminars under the auspices of the Journalism School in 1974 as private conference fora on media, law (particularly the Constitution and the First Amendment) and public policy for the edification of professionals from disparate fields. Drawing upon the case method employed by many professional schools and the Socratic method for interlocution, these eventually evolved into PBS&#x27;s long-running &quot;Fred Friendly Seminars&quot; in 1981.

Following his statutory retirement in 1979, Friendly relinquished control of the Journalism School&#x27;s broadcast program; however, he continued to teach and produce the seminars at Columbia as an administrative officer of the University before retiring in earnest in 1992. By the time of his death in 1998, Friendly &quot;was criticized by some working in network news as being isolated in academia and out of touch with the new realities—and limitations—of the business of broadcast journalism.&quot; The broadcast newsroom and an endowed professorship remain named for Friendly, attesting to his outsized influence at a critical juncture in the development of the school.

While in academia, he authored several books, including &quot;The Good Guys, The Bad Guys, And The First Amendment&quot; (an account of a number of First Amendment court cases and particularly, of the Fairness Doctrine), &quot;Minnesota Rag&quot; (a history of &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot;), &quot;The Constitution: That Delicate Balance&quot;, and &quot;Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control&quot; (a memoir about his sixteen years at CBS).

In 1986, Friendly was appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch to New York City&#x27;s Charter Revision Commission. Chaired by Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., the body&#x27;s recommendations led to the dissolution of the New York City Board of Estimate following the adoption of the city&#x27;s 1990 charter, whereupon the commission dissolved.

Friendly was a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College from April 9-April 12, 1986. He also served as a visiting professor at Yale University (1984) and Bryn Mawr College (1981).

In addition to his work with the seminars, Friendly produced and hosted a ten-part series on PBS, &quot;Ethics in America&quot;, on which a panel of leading intellectuals debated and discussed modern ethical issues.

<doc id="1159738" wikidata="Q7844318" url="?curid=1159738" title="Triton College">
<text>Triton College is a public community college in River Grove, Illinois.

==History==
Junior College District 300 was voted into existence in a referendum in March 1964. In March 1965, a second referendum was passed approving the purchase of an campus site at Fifth Avenue and Palmer Street in River Grove. The school was named Triton College in recognition of the three high school districts that it encompassed – Elmwood Park, Leyden, and Proviso Township. Triton College opened in September 1965 and held classes at several of the high schools in its district. About 1,200 students were enrolled, and full-time in-district tuition was US$5 per semester hour.

Construction on the permanent campus began in June 1967 with the Technology building and proceeded in phases. With the opening of the Learning Resource Center in 1974, the original campus plan was essentially complete, except for some athletic facilities and the Performing Arts Center, a large auditorium planned for the area now occupied by the soccer field, but never built. The original Cernan Space Center building, located north of the Learning Resource Center, was plagued by latent construction defects, and, after being used for several years, was demolished and replaced by the present building located nearby.

In 1972, another referendum was passed adding Oak Park and River Forest, Riverside Brookfield, and Ridgewood high school districts to the original three, forming Community College District 504. This district was expanded to its current size in 1974 by the addition of Rosemont and Pennoyer school districts. By 1975, enrollment had grown to nearly 20,000, in-district tuition had increased to US$11 per semester hour, and Triton had become the largest single-campus community college in Illinois. The campus was expanded by the acquisition of the North Avenue Drive-In theater, which closed in 1973. This area, designated the &quot;East Campus&quot; and located across Fifth Avenue from the original (&quot;West&quot;) campus, was cleared and used mainly for the construction of athletic facilities, as well as a small auditorium as part of the Collins Center.

== Campus ==
Triton College sits on a campus that features electronic classrooms, labs, sports facilities, a library and bookstore, an art gallery and performing arts center, botanical gardens and greenhouses, culinary arts program restaurant and bistro, and the Cernan Earth and Space Center, which is a public planetarium. Recent renovations include the Health Sciences Building, The Student Center Building, and Symonds-Puckett field.

The campus is also the home of Triton Troupers Circus.

== Academics ==
Triton College facilitates accredited Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Fine Arts, and Associate of Applied Science for transfer and career. The institution also offers English as a second language (ESL) and GED classes. Triton College is a member of the Illinois Articulation Initiative and has transfer agreements with universities across the state, such as the University of Illinois. In addition, students can earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees on Triton&#x27;s campus from Southern Illinois University, Dominican University, Benedictine University, and others through the University Center. The college also offers the academically rigorous Scholars Program for high achieving incoming freshman.

=== Rankings ===
In 2016, Payscale.com ranked Triton College the top two-year college in Illinois and among the top in the United States according to salaries of its graduates.

== Student life ==
Triton College boasts a diverse majority-minority student body with sizable populations of Hispanic/Latino, white, African American, and Asian students. The college is also a Hispanic-serving institution. About 75% of students are from the inner ring Chicago suburbs, while residents of Chicago and other cities, states, and countries make up the remaining 25%.

Triton students participate in Model UN, Triton Student Association, and many clubs on a variety of interests. Students also participate in the &quot;Tritonysia&quot; play festival, write and edit the &quot;Fifth Avenue Journal&quot;, and other artistic endeavors.

=== Athletics ===
Triton competes in NJCAA and is a member of the North Central Community College Conference (N4C). The school mascot is the Trojans.

<text>John Lee Carroll (September 30, 1830 – February 27, 1911), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 37th Governor of Maryland from 1876 to 1880.

==Early life==
Carroll was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Col. Charles Carroll (b. 1801) and Mary Digges Lee (b. 1800). Col. Charles Carroll was the grandson of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737–1832), the only Catholic signer and longest living, last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. John Lee Carroll was also a grandson of Congressman John Lee and great-grandson of Maryland&#x27;s second (and seventh) Governor of Maryland, Thomas Sim Lee (1745–1819).

At the age of ten, in 1840, Carroll was sent to Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Frederick County&#x27;s Emmitsburg, where he remained for two years. He then attended Georgetown University in Georgetown, near Washington, D.C., and then the secular part of St. Mary&#x27;s College, on North Paca Street in Baltimore, for another three years. Carroll then decided to enter the legal profession, and like his maternal grandfather, attended Harvard Law School of Harvard College, (now Harvard University), in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston for two terms.

==Career==
After finishing schooling, Carroll worked as a student lawyer for the law office of Brown and Brune in Baltimore. He was admitted to the bar in 1851. Carroll practiced law in Maryland from 1854 until 1858. He ran as a Howard County Democratic candidate for the state General Assembly in 1854, (shortly after the separation of the former Howard or Western District of Anne Arundel County and the &quot;erection&quot;/establishment of Howard as the 22nd of the state&#x27;s 23 counties). However, Lee lost to a candidate of the newly dominant &quot;Know Nothing&quot; Party (also known as the American Party) during the political crises of the 1850s. Carroll then moved to New York City and while there, accepted a position as deputy clerk and United States Commissioner in the office of the clerk of the United States District Court. He stayed there until 1861, at the outbreak of the Civil War, when he returned to Maryland, where he then remained the rest of his life. Upon returning to Maryland, Carroll purchased &quot;Doughoregan Manor&quot;, historic family estate in Howard County, near Ellicott City from his older brother Charles Carroll.

Carroll was elected into the Maryland Senate in 1867 and served four terms, from 1868 to 1876. He was elected President of the State Senate in 1874.

In 1875, Carroll became the Democratic Party nominee for Governor of Maryland, opposed by James Morrison Harris. He won by a 10,000-vote majority and was inaugurated as governor on January 12, 1876.

===Strikes and unrest in 1877===

The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began with a sudden cut in wages by the B. &amp; O. Railroad&#x27;s Board of Directors and President John Work Garrett, which caused workers to walk off the job in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and spread nationwide to the rest of the B. &amp; O., as well as several other lines. Governor Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the Maryland National Guard to stop railroad workers from striking in Cumberland, Hagerstown and in Frederick County&#x27;s shops and roundhouses at Brunswick. Once the news spread by telegraph east, it touched off riots in Baltimore at the Mount Clare Shops and the yards at the B. &amp; O.&#x27;s Camden Street Station, headquarters of the line.

The National Guard attempted to march from their armories to Camden Station—the Fifth Regiment from the armory in the assembly hall above the Richmond Market along North Howard Street in the northwest city, and the Sixth from their armory at North Front and East Fayette Streets, near Jonestown/Old Town. The Fifth marched south down Howard Street and the Sixth attempted to march south on Front Street along the east bank of the Jones Falls for a few blocks then west on East Baltimore Street, through the middle of the downtown business district (and avoided the obvious associations of marching along the waterfront of Pratt Street, as the 6th Massachusetts Regiment did 16 years before, with its tragic memories). Despite this precaution, each regiment had to again literally fight its way through the streets of the city, attacked by projectiles, rocks and angry mobs the entire way. Conflict gripped the city and Governor Carroll was powerless to stem the tide. Later, additional reinforcements of Federal troops were called in by newly elected 19th President Rutherford B. Hayes to restore order in Baltimore.

===Later career===
In later years, Carroll served on the Howard County Board of Education and served in 1883 on an early grand jury that used both Caucasian and African American members.

Carroll was also a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the Revolution.

==Marriage and children==
Carroll was married twice, first to Anita Phelps (April 23, 1838 – March 24, 1873), daughter of Royal Phelps of New York, on April 24, 1856. They had nine children:

* Charles Lee Carroll (October 5, 1857 – 1858)
* Mary Louisa Carroll (b. May 26, 1859); married Comte Jean de Kergorlay, of France
* Anita Maria Carroll (b. March 28, 1861); married Baron Louis de la Grange, of France
* Royal Phelps Carroll (October 29, 1863 – 1922), attended Harvard College (class of 1885); married to Marion Langdon (1864–1949), daughter of Eugene and Harriet ( Lowndes) Langdon of New York and a descendant of John Jacob Astor, 1 daughter 
* Charles Carroll (January 12, 1865 – 1921); married Suzanne Bancroft (1865 – 1959), 1 son
* Albert Henry Carroll (October 6, 1866 – 1867)
* Mary Irene Carroll (March 3, 1869 – November 8, 1888)
* John Lee Carroll (February 26, 1871 – c. 1895)
* Mary Helen Carroll (b. 1873); married Herbert Robbins (1869 – 1946), no issue

Carroll was married secondly to Mary Carter Thompson (1847–1899), daughter of Judge Lucas P. Thompson, in April 1877 and had one son. As of 2012, Philip&#x27;s grandchildren owned Doughoregan Manor, the family estate in Howard County.
* Philip Acosta Carroll (b. May 10, 1879 – July 1957); married to Nina Ryan (1897 – 1989), 2 sons and 1 daughter

Mary Thompson&#x27;s sister Caroline Thompson was married to John Lee&#x27;s older brother, Charles Carroll (1828–1895).

Carroll died in Washington, D.C. and was buried at the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore City, Maryland.

<text>The Lutheran Hour is a U.S.-based Christian radio program produced by Lutheran Hour Ministries. The weekly broadcast began on October 2, 1930, as an outreach ministry of the Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League, part of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). Since 2018, Rev. Dr. Michael Zeigler is the current speaker of &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot;. During the 1950s–1980s, the program was heard on 1,200 stations in the U.S. and in thirty other nations. Its motto is &quot;Bringing Christ to the Nations&quot;.

==History==
On October 2, 1930, the Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League began the weekly national broadcast of &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; with Walter A. Maier as the first speaker. Initially, the program was on 32 stations of the CBS network. Maier continued as the program&#x27;s well-known speaker for the next twenty years (1930–1950). In 1940, &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; began a Spanish-language broadcast by Dr. Andrew Melendez. Beginning in 1955, Oswald Hoffmann became speaker for the next thirty-three years (1955–1988), heard on 1,200 stations in the U.S. and in thirty other nations. In 1992, the Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League selected &quot;Lutheran Hour Ministries&quot; as the overall identity for its media outreach programs. By 2012, &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; was heard on 800 stations in the U.S. and on the American Forces Network, consisting of organ and choral music preceding the speaker&#x27;s and a recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

==Speakers==
Michael Zeigler has been &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; speaker since October 2018. An engineering graduate of the Air Force Academy, he served as an officer in the U.S. Air Force until 2006, when he entered Concordia Seminary to become a Lutheran minister. He holds Master of Divinity and PhD degrees. Although music is no longer a part of the program, the traditional conclusion of each broadcast with the speaker&#x27;s offering of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer continues.

The show has had a number of speakers:
*Walter A. Maier (1930–1950)
*Andrew Melendez (1941–1972) (Spanish Lutheran Hour)
*Lawrence Acker (1950–1951)
*Armin C. Oldsen (1951–1953)
*Oswald Hoffmann (1955–1988)
*Wallace Schulz (1977–2002) (associate speaker)
*Dale A. Meyer (1989–2001; guest speaker November 2017–September 2018)
*Kenneth R. Klaus (2002–2011; guest speaker November 2017–September 2018)
*Gregory P. Seltz (2011–October 29, 2017)
*Michael Zeigler (2018–present)

===2002 controversy===
In July 2002, weeks after his promotion from associate speaker to main speaker, Wallace Schulz was involved in an LCMS controversy that resulted in his leaving the broadcast. Acting in his capacity as LCMS Second Vice President, Schulz suspended LCMS Atlantic District president David Benke, ruling that Benke, by taking part in an inter-faith prayer event at Yankee Stadium to commemorate the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, had engaged in syncretism and unionism, practices prohibited by the LCMS. (Benke&#x27;s suspension was later overturned on appeal.) The show&#x27;s board of governors, shortly following Schulz&#x27;s elevation to main speaker, had requested that he recuse himself from the Benke adjudication to avoid &quot;a conflict of interest&quot; in his duties to the Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League, which operates Lutheran Hour Ministries and had not taken an official position on the Benke case in order to avoid alienating members holding differing views on the issue. When Schulz accepted the Benke case, the board relieved him of his duties while keeping him on the payroll, stating that the radio program had been &quot;compromised&quot; by Schulz&#x27;s participation in church politics, and that it might serve to &quot;polarize&quot; the International Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League. The LLL offered Schulz a return to the show under condition that he accept stipulations for future conduct, but Schulz refused to accept these restrictions and thus did not return to the show.

Schulz&#x27;s removal, like the Benke case itself, proved controversial within the LCMS. His supporters argued that Schulz had a constitutional duty to rule in the case, and thus could not recuse himself upon the board of governors’ request. Eric Stefanski, in a column published by the conservative LCMS group Concord, accused the LLL of waging &quot;a massive, twisted PR battle&quot; against Schulz, and of presenting him with &quot;ultimatums that no pastor could agree to without denying his Ordination vows.&quot; Supporters of Schulz also argued that a drop in financial receipts at the ILLL, which led to layoffs and program cancellations in 2003, were attributable primarily to donor and listener dissatisfaction over the speaker&#x27;s removal. Opponents of Schulz&#x27;s actions praised the decision to suspend the speaker, with many arguing, as a column published by the liberal LCMS organization Jesus First stated, that those who disagreed with Schulz&#x27;s actions were &quot;working hard to present views more representative of this church&quot;.

<doc id="1159746" wikidata="Q7333264" url="?curid=1159746" title="Rifle Volunteers">
<text>The Rifle Volunteers was a regiment of the British Territorial Army. In 2007, it was re-designated as 6th Battalion, The Rifles.

==History==
The &quot;Rifle Volunteers&quot; were formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of the 6th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Light Infantry, 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and elements of the 2nd (Volunteer) Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment in consequence of the reforms implemented due to the Strategic Defence Review. The HQ was in Exeter, and the battalion comprised five rifle companies and a headquarters company, as follows:
*HQ Company, at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter
*A (The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment) Company, at Gloucester, Bristol, and Cinderford
*B (Somerset Light Infantry) Company, at Taunton, Yeovil, and Bath
*C (Devonshire and Dorset Regiment) Company, at Dorchester and Poole
*D (Cornwall Light Infantry) Company, at Truro, Bodmin, and Camborne
*E (Devonshire and Dorset Regiment) Company, at Plymouth and Exeter

The Volunteer Band of the 4th Battalion, The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment formed the band of the Rifle Volunteers. The battalion regularly entered the Nordic &amp; Biathlon Championships known as &quot;Exercise Spartan Hike&quot;, held in Serre Chevalier, France each year. They were Territorial Army and 5th Division Champions for three years running between 2003 and 2005.
In 1999 a number of individuals were mobilised from The Rifle Volunteers to join 2nd Battalion The Royal Green Jackets on their Kosovo tour returning in early 2000.

The first major deployment from The Rifle Volunteers was in November 2003 when 55 soldiers were deployed to the Kabul, Afghanistan. Attached to C &#x27;Tavolato&#x27; Company of 2nd Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles. On 28 January 2004 Private Jonathan Kitulagoda was killed by a suicide bomber whilst on a routine patrol.

In April 2004 a composite company of the regiment (Salamanca Company) was dispatched to Basra, Iraq. The company was attached to the 1st Battalion Cheshire Regiment, as part of 1 Mechanised Brigade, within the Multi-National Division (South East). Salamanca Company distinguished itself; Sergeant Peter &#x27;Stooley&#x27; Poole-Reeves was awarded a Mention in Dispatches for his actions during a contact in which he was shot in the chest plate of his body armour. Additionally Sergeant Kevin Pinnell and Private Matthew Gavin were awarded Joint Commander&#x27;s Commendations. The company returned home at the end of October. The battalion was part of 43 (Wessex) Brigade.

===Structure before re-designation===
Shortly before re-designation as a battalion of the Rifles, the regiment&#x27;s structure underwent a reform in order to reflect its post amalgamation structure, and ease the process:
*HQ (Devonshire and Dorset) Company, at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter
*A (Gloucestershire) Company, at Gloucester and Bristol
*B Company, at Taunton and Exeter
*C (Devonshire and Dorset) Company, at Dorchester and Poole
*D Company, at Bodmin and Plymouth

==6th Battalion, The Rifles==
On 24 November 2005, it was announced by the Ministry of Defence that the battalion would be re-designated as a territorial battalion of a new large regiment to be called The Rifles. To that effect on 1 February 2007, the regiment became 6th Battalion, The Rifles. The battalion now serves as the reserve infantry battalion for Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Gloucestershire, and Hereford, with sub-units spread right across its recruiting area.

===Current Structure===
The battalion&#x27;s current structure is as follows:
*HQ Company, at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter
**Detachment, at Paignton
**Detachment, at Barnstaple
*A Company, at Gloucester
**2 Platoon, at Suvla Barracks, Hereford
**3 Platoon, at HMS Flying Fox, Bristol
*C Company, at Dorchester
**6 Platoon, at Poole
*D Company, at Truro
**8 Platoon, at Plymouth

<doc id="1159754" wikidata="Q7084278" url="?curid=1159754" title="Old Ironsides (poem)">
<text>&quot;Old Ironsides&quot; is a poem written by American writer Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. on September 16, 1830, as a tribute to the 18th-century . The poem was one reason that the frigate was saved from being decommissioned, and it is now the oldest commissioned ship in the world that is still afloat.

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
Aye tear her tattered ensign down
Long has it waved on high,
And many an eye has danced to see 
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon&#x27;s roar;—
The meteor of the ocean air
Shall sweep the clouds no more.

Her deck, once red with heroes&#x27; blood,
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o&#x27;er the flood,
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor&#x27;s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!

Oh, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set every threadbare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,
The lightning and the gale!
&lt;/poem&gt;
- Oliver Wendell Holmes

==Background==
&quot;Old Ironsides&quot; was the nickname given to the 18th-century frigate, USS &quot;Constitution&quot; during the War of 1812 after its naval battle with . &quot;Constitution&quot; was one of the original six frigates of the United States Navy, commissioned by the Naval Act of 1794. It was the third of four ships with 44 guns and was granted its name by President George Washington. The ship saw action during the Quasi-War, the First Barbary War, the Battle of Tripoli Harbor, and the Battle of Derne before it earned the famous nickname during the War of 1812. It was nicknamed this because the live oak wood with which the ship was made was so strong that the 18-pound British cannonballs bounced right off the hull.

==Composition and publication history==
Holmes had recently abandoned his studies of law and began writing poetry for fun. In September 1830, he read an article in the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; about the Navy&#x27;s plans to dismantle the historic USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. Startled, he was moved to write &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; to express his opposition to the scrapping. The poem was published in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; the next day and was soon reprinted by papers in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington.

==Response==
The poem brought Holmes immediate national attention, and the poem would remain among his best-known. Also, the poem generated enough public sentiment that the historic ship was preserved though plans to do so may have already been in motion. Today, &quot;Constitution&quot; is well known by its nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; and is the oldest commissioned ship in the world that is still afloat.

<doc id="1159758" wikidata="Q5218013" url="?curid=1159758" title="Daniel MacIvor">
<text>Daniel MacIvor (born July 23, 1962) is a Canadian actor, playwright, theatre director, and film director. He is probably best known for his acting roles in independent films and the sitcom &quot;Twitch City&quot;.

==Personal==
MacIvor was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia and educated at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and then at George Brown College in Toronto. MacIvor is openly gay. He married Paul Goulet in 2006; they have since divorced. He has an Italian Greyhound, called &#x27;Buddy&#x27;. In 2021, MacIvor earned an MA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies from the University of Toronto.

==Career==
In addition to his film and theatrical credits, MacIvor wrote the libretto to the opera &quot;Hadrian,&quot; for which Rufus Wainwright wrote the music.

===Theatre===
MacIvor founded the theatre company da da kamera with Michele Jelley in 1986 to independently produce his own work. He was in residence at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre - for whom he has written, directed, and acted. His plays include &quot;Never Swim Alone&quot;, &quot;This is a Play&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Marion Bridge&quot;, &quot;You are Here&quot;, &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;, and &quot;A Beautiful View&quot;. Five of MacIvor&#x27;s plays were published as &quot;I Still Love You&quot; in 2006, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of da da kamera, (&quot;Never Swim Alone&quot;, &quot;The Soldier Dreams&quot;, &quot;You are Here&quot;, &quot;In on It&quot;, and &quot;A Beautiful View&quot;), and won MacIvor a coveted Governor General&#x27;s Award for Drama.

===Solo theatre work===
MacIvor is particularly well known for a series of solo shows created in collaboration with director Daniel Brooks. These include &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Here Lies Henry&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;. These incorporate a minimalist and meta-theatrical style. In &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Here Lies Henry&quot;, MacIvor portrays one character who speaks directly to the audience, acknowledging their presence. While the direct address of the audience continues in &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;, MacIvor portrays several characters throughout the course of the piece and this direct address is occasionally broken up by dialogue between these characters.

In 1992, &quot;2-2 Tango&quot; was included in &quot;Making Out&quot;, the first anthology of Canadian plays by gay writers, alongside works by Ken Garnhum, Sky Gilbert, David Demchuk, Harry Rintoul and Colin Thomas.

The first three of these pieces were staged at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in the 2006/2007 season as part of a tribute and retrospective of da da kamera&#x27;s work.

MacIvor and Brooks later collaborated with Iris Turcott to create the play &quot;Who Killed Spalding Gray?&quot;, in which MacIvor performs the part of a fictional character partly based on the style of deceased American actor Spalding Gray. The show premiered at the Halifax&#x27;s Magnetic North Theatre Festival, and was later performed in Toronto at the Luminato Festival and at the High Performance Rodeo in Calgary

===Film===
In his early film work, MacIvor frequently collaborated with director Laurie Lynd, including on the short films &quot;RSVP&quot; in 1991, &quot;The Fairy Who Didn&#x27;t Want to Be a Fairy Anymore&quot; in 1992, and the feature film &quot;House&quot; (1995).

In the early 2000s MacIvor wrote, co-wrote and directed several independent films, which were usually made in his home province of Nova Scotia. They include &quot;Past Perfect,&quot; &quot;Marion Bridge&quot;, &quot;Whole New Thing&quot; and &quot;Wilby Wonderful&quot;.

As an actor he appeared in Cynthia Roberts&#x27;s &quot;Bubbles Galore&quot; and Jeremy Podeswa&#x27;s &quot;The Five Senses&quot;, had a recurring role in the television series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; and played Nathan in the iconic Canadian television series &quot;Twitch City.&quot; In recent years MacIvor has been working with director Bruce McDonald as screenwriter of the films &quot;Trigger&quot; and &quot;Weirdos&quot; (for which MacIvor won a Canadian Screen Award in 2017 for best original screenplay).

==Awards and honors==
In addition to winning the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Drama in 2006. MacIvor has won other notable awards during his career. Mr. MacIvor also has two Chalmers New Play Awards, once in 1997 and 1992.

===Plays===

In 1998, MacIvor won the award for overall excellence at the New York International Fringe Festival for his play &quot;Never Swim Alone&quot;.

In 2002, his play &quot;In On It&quot; earned him a GLAAD Award and a Village Voice Obie Award.

<text>The 1970 NBA draft was the 24th annual draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held on March 23, 1970, before the 1970–71 season. In this draft, 17 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection. If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated. The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each division, with the order determined by a coin flip. The Detroit Pistons won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the San Diego Rockets were awarded the second pick. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. Three expansion franchises, the Buffalo Braves, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Portland Trail Blazers, took part in the NBA Draft for the first time and were assigned the seventh, the eighth and the ninth pick in each round. In the first round, the Cavaliers had the seventh pick, while the Blazers and the Braves had the eighth and the ninth pick respectively. In the subsequent rounds, the Cavaliers and the Braves exchanged their order of selection, while the Blazers had the eighth pick throughout the draft. The draft consisted of 19 rounds comprising the selection of 239 players; it holds the record for the most prospects selected in any NBA draft.

==Draft selections and draftee career notes==
Bob Lanier from St. Bonaventure University was selected first overall by the Detroit Pistons. Rudy Tomjanovich from the University of Michigan and Pete Maravich from Louisiana State University were selected second and third respectively. Fourth pick Dave Cowens from Florida State University and eighth pick Geoff Petrie from Princeton University went on to be named as joint winners of the Rookie of the Year Award in their first season. Six players from this draft, Lanier, Maravich, Cowens, 18th pick Calvin Murphy, 19th pick Nate Archibald and 122nd pick Dan Issel, have been inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Maravich, Cowens and Archibald were also named to the list of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History announced at the league&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1996. Maravich had four All-NBA Team selections and five All-Star Game selections. Cowens won two NBA championships with the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, one Most Valuable Player Award in 1973, and had three All-NBA Team selections and seven All-Star Game selections. Archibald won one NBA championship with the Celtics in 1981 and had five All-NBA Team selections and six All-Star Game selections. Lanier and Murphy were selected to eight and one All-Star Games respectively. Dan Issel initially opted to play in the American Basketball Association (ABA) with the Kentucky Colonels. He played six seasons in the ABA before finally joining the NBA with the Denver Nuggets when both leagues merged. He was selected to five All-ABA Teams, six ABA All-Star Games and one NBA All-Star Game.

Randy Smith, who was selected by the Detroit Pistons with the 205th pick, did not enter the league until the 1971–72 season, after he was drafted again in the 1971 NBA draft by the Buffalo Braves with the 104th pick. He was selected to both the All-NBA Team and the All-Star Game. Tomjanovich was selected to five All-Star Games during his career. Charlie Scott, the 106th pick, initially opted to play in the ABA with the Virginia Squires before joining the NBA in 1972. He was selected to two All-ABA Teams, two ABA All-Star Games and three NBA All-Star Games. Three other players from this draft, fifth pick Sam Lacey, seventh pick John Johnson and eighth pick Geoff Petrie, was also selected to at least one All-Star Game. The Rockets&#x27; first and second round picks, Tomjanovich and Murphy spent all of their playing career with the Rockets. Tomjanovich played 11 seasons while Murphy played 13 seasons with the Rockets.

Lanier, Tomjanovich, Cowens and Issel all became head coaches after ending their playing career. Lanier was the interim head coach of the Golden State Warriors in the 1995. Tomjanovich coached two NBA teams, the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers. He coached the Rockets for 12 seasons, leading them to the NBA championship twice in 1994 and 1995. He also coached the United States national basketball team to a gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. Cowens started his coaching career as a player-coach with the Celtics during the 1978–79 season, before returning to a full-time player in the next season. He later coached two more NBA teams, most recently with the Golden State Warriors. Issel coached the Denver Nuggets for six seasons in two separate three-year stints. Two other players drafted also went on to have coaching careers in the NBA: 40th pick Gar Heard and 125th pick George Irvine.

The 1970 draft class is considered to be one of the best in NBA history as it produced eight Hall of Famers and twelve All-Stars from those draftees who played in the NBA. The first four picks were inducted to the Hall of Fame and seven of the first eight picks became All-Stars. The 1970 Draft is also known as the first draft where international players who had never played U.S. high school and college basketball were selected. In the 10th and 11th round, the Atlanta Hawks drafted Mexican Manuel Raga and Italian Dino Meneghin; both were playing in the Italian league at the time. They became the first two international players drafted to the NBA. However, neither of them ever played in the league as the Hawks did not have US$35,000 to buy out either of their contracts with their teams. Meneghin, who played 28 seasons in Italy, has been inducted by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to the FIBA Hall of Fame and also to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Raga has also been inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1159779" wikidata="Q3487113" url="?curid=1159779" title="Snak">
<text>Snak (Danish for &quot;chat&quot;) was a shareware Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client written by Kent Sorensen for the Macintosh platform. Snak was distributed as shareware and could be freely used and evaluated for 30 days at no charge. After the 30-day evaluation period has ended, the program would quit after 15 minutes of use, and a registration key had to be purchased. Versions up to 4.12 run on both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X while version 5 and newer only support Mac OS X. The program is Intel Only as of version 5.3.4. The program is not fully compatible with current macOS versions and is no longer supported, with the developer stating that he is unable to create new versions due to the deprecation of the Carbon libraries. On October 10, 2018, Snak was made freeware with a license key published on the project&#x27;s web site.

==Features==
Snak supports an unlimited number of connections and channels, private chats, as well as full DCC support for file transfers and chat. It can be scripted with AppleScript and the ircII scripting language. Snak features an Actions list which makes it easy to automate responses to many common events on IRC.

Snak includes the ability for multiple panels to share the windows. A panel can contain a channel, a dialog with another user, a list, or information about a DCC file transfer. This results in an effective use of the screen space and improves the ability to follow multiple channels. A panel can be moved from one window to another by dragging the title bar or the panel tab.

Although limited support UTF-8 support has been included since version 5.1.5 (released 2006-09-23), as of December 30, 2014, full UTF-8 support is still lacking (promised for &quot;the next major version&quot;).

==Reception==
Jason Parker, Assistant editor for Download.com, wrote for CNET Reviews on May 26, 2005, &quot;If you want a great IRC chat client for Mac, Snak is hands-down the best in the category.&quot;

<text>The Yamaha AN1x is a DSP-based analog modeling synthesizer (a.k.a. virtual analog synthesizer), produced by Yamaha Corporation from 1997 to 1998, and was marketed as an &quot;analog physical modelling control synthesizer&quot;.

==Development==
The AN1x is a first-generation virtual analogue physical modelling synthesizer. After Clavia released the original Nord Lead in 1995, Roland followed suit in 1996 with the JP-8000. Yamaha, having already been working on physical modelling synthesis for a number of years, released the AN1x in mid-1997. 

Whilst the AN1x has a similar chassis to other Yamaha synthesizers, such as the CS1x and particularly the CS2x, this is where the similarity ends. The latter use pre-loaded sample-based synthesis to generate sound, thus categorising them as romplers. The AN1x on the other hand is a fully fledged synthesizer. Yamaha&#x27;s proprietary &#x27;virtual analog&#x27; technology, models the components that traditionally occupy the signal path of an analog subtractive synthesizer. The VCOs, VCAs, VCFs, and LFOs etc., are all digitally modelled and rendered using DSP VLSI processor(s).

It has been noted that the firmware of the AN1x contains simulated characteristics of Sequential Circuits&#x27; Prophet 5 and particularly the Prophet 10 synthesizers, as well as Yamaha&#x27;s own CS range of polyphonic analog synthesisers. Yamaha purchased the rights to Sequential Circuits in 1987, following the dissolution of the company. Sequential&#x27;s founder, Dave Smith subsequently became President of DSD Inc., a research and development division of Yamaha. During his time at Yamaha, in addition to his work on vector and wavetable synthesis, which culminated in the SY22 and TG33, Smith also worked on physical modelling synthesis and software synthesizer concepts. Research that laid the foundations for the development of the AN1x.

==Scenes and voice architecture==
The AN1x is a duo-timbral synthesizer, having two individual sets of voice parameters, called &quot;Scenes&quot;, for each of the 128 voice patches. Within each voice, each scene can be programmed to be similar sounding variations of each other, two identical copies of the same sound, or even two completely different sounding timbres.

The user can either quickly switch between the two &quot;Scenes&quot;, or morph between them, which interpolates individual parameters, rather than simply crossfading. The result being complex new timbres being heard whilst morphing. It is also possible to save a snapshot of the timbre at any point during a morph, to become a new baseline timbre for one of the &quot;Scenes&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Scene&quot; data can be copied from, or saved to a different voice patch entirely. When the AN1x&#x27;s &quot;Layer&quot; mode is set to either &quot;Split/Split Unison&quot; or &quot;Dual/Dual Unison&quot;, dual timbrality is possible, whereby &quot;Scenes&quot; can be set to receive MIDI data on two separate channels. Each &quot;Scene&quot; will have five notes of polyphony. The AN1x has a maximum polyphony of ten notes, although the actual polyphony depends upon the playing mode the synthesizer is set to. These being either a single monotimbral &quot;Scene&quot;, two &quot;Scenes&quot; layered or split, monophonic or polyphonic, and whether the note-multiplying &quot;Unison&quot; mode is active. Dual mode halves polyphony to five notes per voice, dividing each of the two internal 5-note DSP processors between both &quot;Scenes&quot; separately; dual timbral. In mono or dual modes, &quot;Unison&quot; uses five notes per key per &quot;Scene&quot; for a single voice (1 processor × 5 notes), or two notes per key for a dual voice (2 processors × 1 timbre per processor); thus, in &quot;Dual&quot;, &quot;Mono&quot; or &quot;Unison&quot; mode, the synthesizer is monophonic for each of the two &quot;Scenes&quot;. In polyphonic mode, &quot;Unison&quot; is only possible for single voices, each key takes two notes, of the same timbre, one from each of the two processors.

==Waveform oscillators==
The voice architecture is based on a dual oscillator design with multi-mode filter. Available waveforms are: &quot;Pulse-width modulation&quot; (PWM), &quot;Saw&quot;, &quot;Square&quot;, &quot;Saw2&quot;, &quot;Saw/Pulse Wave mix&quot;, and &quot;Saw/Square mix&quot;. Additional waves, &quot;Inner 1-3&quot; are available for the first oscillator (OSC1) in oscillator sync mode. Triangle and sine waves are possible by altering the shape of pulse waves. The AN1x has a wave shaping &quot;Edge&quot; tool, which can facilitate 128 intermediate waves. The first oscillator can be split to have a master, main and a tuneable slave sub-oscillator, when activated via three oscillator sync algorithms. The master and/or slave oscillator within OSC1 can be modulated by the first low-frequency oscillator (LFO1), either jointly or individually. The AN1x has twin operator frequency modulation (FM), comprising four algorithms, where the first oscillator is modulated by the second. Finally there is ring modulation and white noise. When set to &quot;Unison&quot; mode, the AN1x layers five oscillators for each &quot;Scene&quot; timbre. Whilst this reduces polyphony, &quot;Unison&quot; thickens up the sound considerably. Additionally, stereo separation can be set for panning, as well as the tuning of the five layered oscillators. The overall effect is not too dissimilar from the Roland JP-8000 &quot;supersaw&quot; waveform, except that &quot;Unison&quot; can be applied to waveforms other than the sawtooth wave.

==Filters, envelopes, low frequency oscillators and control matrix==
Each of the two scenes that make up a single voice is composed of an amplitude envelope, a filter envelope, a pitch envelope, and a three-band equaliser. These affect the combined two oscillators on a per-note basis. The AN1x has two LFOs. LFO1 comprises 21 waveforms: 5× sine variations, 5× triangle variations, 3× square variations, 4× saw variations and 4× sample and hold variations. LFO2 consists of a triangle wave only. These affect all notes at once, i.e. monophonic LFOs. The LFOs are fast, up to the audible note range. The AN1x has a non-resonant high-pass filter, which is situated in series with a multimode resonant filter, the latter offering a low-pass filter (LPF), high-pass filter (HPF), band-pass filter (BPF) and band elimination filter (BEF). The multimode filter is capable of resonant self oscillation. Additionally, feedback from the voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) is routed back to the oscillator mixer before the main filter, and frequency modulation can be used alongside oscillator sync. The AN1x has a comprehensive modulation matrix, comprising 16 sources and 96 destinations.

==Sequencing capabilities==
The AN1x features an arpeggiator with 30 preset patterns, a step sequencer with 16 steps, 256 total sequence patterns, 128 voice patterns &#x27;one per voice&#x27; + 128 user patterns. All 256 patterns can be overwritten for use, and a &#x27;Free Envelope Generator&#x27; &#x27;128 user patterns, one per voice&#x27;. The arpeggiator and sequencer can both output to MIDI and sync to MIDI timecode, and the arpeggiator can also be applied to incoming MIDI data. Furthermore, the notes may be fixed or transposed via the synthesizer&#x27;s keyboard or MIDI input. The step sequencer can be used to send control data, such as filter cutoff values or notes to the synthesizer&#x27;s tone generator or to MIDI output. Both the arpeggiator and step sequencer have several looping modes. The &#x27;Free Envelope Generator&#x27; (Free EG) is a powerful motion control feature that allows the user to record controller movements for up to four parameters, &#x27;4 tracks, 1 parameter per track&#x27; for a duration of up to 16 seconds each, or 8 bars that are tempo linked.

Note: If the tempo is set to 40bpm, with a 4/4 count, this would result in 48 seconds of recording time per track. 
When applied to a voice, the Free EG becomes an intrinsic component of the voice whilst it is played, allowing for complex and evolving organic movement of sound. The way in which the Free EG loops can also be set in various ways, as well as the keyboard tracking and triggering.

==Multi effects==
The effects section contains three different sets of programmable effects, as well as a programmable 3-band equaliser (EQ). 
The 14 variation effect types are: Chorus, &#x27;2 types&#x27;, flanger, symphonic, phaser, auto pan, rotary speaker, pitch change, aural exciter, compressor, wah, distortion, overdrive and amp simulator. 
The five delay effect types are: Delay left-centre-right (LCR), delay left-right (LR), echo, cross delay and tempo delay, which automatically matches the delay time to the current tempo setting. The eight reverb effect types include three types of hall reverb, two types each of room and stage reverb, and a plate reverb.

The voice signal initially passes through the variation and EQ sections in series, then on to the delay and reverb sections. The delay and reverb sections can be configured to operate in either series or parallel. Individual effects sections (variation, delay, reverb) or all effects, excluding the EQ, can be bypassed at will. Additionally, realtime controllers can be designated to control specific effect parameters.

==Control synthesizer==
As well as promoting its &quot;Analog Physical Modelling&quot;, Yamaha referred to the AN1x as a &quot;control synthesizer&quot;, in a similar vein to the CS1x and CS2x. This is due to each voice patch in the AN1x having 20 &quot;control sets&quot;, which utilise assignments of the user-adjustable controls and MIDI control change messages to a number of numerical parameters within the sound engine.

The user controls include: Keyboard pitch, velocity and channel aftertouch, a modulation wheel, a pressure-sensitive (X-axis,Z-axis) ribbon controller, two expression pedal input sockets, a footswitch input socket, and eight assignable parameter control knobs. The underlying philosophy of this arrangement is that the user doesn&#x27;t have to alter the actual sound editing parameters whilst playing, instead using the assignable real-time controls mentioned above.

The physical keyboard action includes velocity, aftertouch, and portamento. The X-Z ribbon controller, responds to horizontal sweeps and pressure. The eight realtime control knobs can also be pressed to display their current parameter values. Each knob and controller can have multiple parameters assigned to them.

==Controller resolution==
Being a first-generation virtual analog synthesizer, the AN1x&#x27;s controller resolution responds by default to 128 increments from its built in controllers. Consequently, the user will sometimes hear slight but distinct stepping of the filter, especially when more pronounced resonance is used. However, there are several workarounds: The first is to press the control knobs while rotating them to access smoother increments, but over a narrower frequency range. The second method involves the use of a MIDI controller or synthesizer, whose controllers generate higher resolution data values. The AN1x responds to this due to its mature MIDI implementation and NRPN recognition. The result being a smoothing out of the filter sweep, therefore giving a more authentic analog feel.

==Physical characteristics==
The keyboard&#x27;s main housing is made of ABS plastic, and the chassis base is metal. Dimensions: (W) × (D) × (H). Weight: .

==Reception and usage==
Though containing more features than its contemporaries, the control interface of the AN1x initially proved frustrating for some users, due to its programming being matrix-based rather than one control per parameter like the Roland JP-8000. To counter these early misgivings, a sound set was released by Yamaha UK, called the &quot;London&quot; sound set, which contained clones of some of the JP-8000 presets. This helped to demonstrate the sound capabilities of the AN1x. 

In 2000, Yamaha used the AN1x synthesis architecture to produce the PLG150-AN plugin board for the CS6x. The following year, Yamaha followed the AN1x with the AN200, a groovebox-type desktop sound module.

The AN1x has been used by numerous artists, including: Jean Michel Jarre, Psyclon Nine, History Of Guns, Velvet Acid Christ, Nine Inch Nails, Nitin Sawhney, Phish, Igor Khoroshev of YES, Steve Hillier of Dubstar, Jacob Thiele of The Faint, 808 State, Antti Pouta of Pariisin Kevät, Above &amp; Beyond, Jesper Anderberg of The Sounds, Daniel Ruppar of Down In The Lab/One Chord Till Anarchy, and Boards of Canada.

<doc id="1159824" wikidata="Q7965210" url="?curid=1159824" title="Walter Inglis Anderson">
<text>Walter Inglis Anderson (September 29, 1903 – November 30, 1965) was an American painter and writer.

Anderson died from cancer November 30, 1965, at the age of 62.

== Early life and education ==
Anderson was born in New Orleans to George Walter Anderson, a grain broker, and Annette McConnell Anderson, a prominent New Orleans family member who had studied art at Newcomb College. He was the second of three brothers, the eldest being Peter Anderson and the youngest James McConnell &quot;Mac&quot; Anderson.

As a child, Anderson attended St. John’s School in Manilus, New York until his schooling was interrupted at age 14 by World War I. He then transferred to the Manual Training School in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In 1922 he enrolled at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (now Parsons School of Design). After a year at Parsons, he won a scholarship to study at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Here (1924–1928) he would study under iconoclastic modernists like Henry McCarter, Hugh Breckenridge, and Arthur Carles, winning a Packard Award for his animal drawing and a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, which allowed him to spend a summer in France. While in France, Anderson was particularly impressed with cave paintings, which noticeably influenced his drawing style.

==Ocean Springs==
Anderson&#x27;s older brother Peter opened the Shearwater Pottery Factory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi in 1928, on a 24-acre parcel of property his parents had purchased in 1918.

Anderson moved to Ocean Springs after his years at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and worked as a designer in the family business, Shearwater Pottery. In 1928-29 he designed his earliest ceramic pieces: pelican and crab bookends, lampstands, peculiar &quot;Resting&quot; and &quot;Sitting Geometric Cat&quot;; a &quot;Horse and Rider&quot; and innumerable plates and vases. His work as a designer and decorator at Shearwater Pottery from 1928 until his death, included incised pieces, sgraffito work, underglaze decoration, woodcarvings of saints, and designs for furniture.

Among his early projects, launched with his younger brother James (&quot;Mac&quot;), was a &quot;Shearwater Pottery Annex&quot; which produced inexpensive figurines, giving Anderson enough of an income in 1932 to marry Agnes Grinstead an art history graduate of Radcliffe College, who would later write a poignant memoir of their life together (&quot;Approaching the Magic Hour&quot;). During the early years, manufacturing of the figurines, which he called &quot;widgets&quot;, prevented Anderson from painting and led to considerable tension. 

In 1934, commissioned by a family friend, Ellsworth Woodward, Anderson painted an ambitious mural in the auditorium of the Ocean Springs Public School (&quot;Ocean Springs Past and Present&quot;) as part of Public Works of Art Project. Paintings from this period include: &quot;Indians Hunting&quot;; &quot;Jockeys Riding Horses&quot;; four oil portraits of Sissy, 1933–37; &quot;Black Skimmer&quot;; &quot;Androcles and Lion&quot;; &quot;Man on Horse&quot;; and Birth of Achilles (Memphis Brooks Museum of Art); along with watercolors of flowers, animals, and birds; studies for a projected book on birds of the southeastern U.S.; and linoleum blockprints, including &quot;Tourist Cards;&quot; &quot;Alphabet&quot;; nursery rhymes; &quot;On the River&quot;; &quot;Valkyries&quot;; &quot;Butterfly Book&quot;; and scenes from Shearwater Pottery. Designs for a second mural, in the Jackson, Mississippi, Court House, were accepted by an illustrious committee then rejected by a Washington bureaucrat, causing Anderson considerable frustration. This disappointment, coupled with the death of his father in 1937, lingering bouts of both malaria and undulant fever, and the struggle to eke out a living with work he detested (manufacturing figurines) led to a mental breakdown, with psychotic episodes, in 1937. 

==Oldfields==
In 1941, Anderson moved to Gautier, Mississippi, to live on his wife&#x27;s father&#x27;s estate (Oldfields) with his family. An extraordinarily productive period followed. Freed from his work at the Pottery, he had time to draw, paint and make block prints; to illustrate some of his favorite books; to experiment with theories of dynamic symmetry and with the drawing methods of the Mexican artist and educator Adolfo Best Maugard; and to translate from Spanish part of Jose Pijoan&#x27;s history of art (probably without realizing that the work had already been translated into English).

==Horn Island==
The Oldfields period came to an end in 1945 when he left his family and moved back to a cottage at Shearwater. From then until his death in 1965 he lived a reclusive life, working as a decorator at the Pottery and making frequent excursions in a rowboat sometimes rigged with a sail, from Ocean Springs to Horn Island, Mississippi, where he lived in primitive conditions and portrayed the life around him - birds, sea creatures, animals, trees, landscapes - in radiant watercolors and in a series of logbooks. He also ventured abroad to Costa Rica and China, and made numerous bicycle trips, on some of which he traveled for thousands of miles. &quot;The wheels are turning again&quot;, he once wrote. &quot;A bicycle seems to leave no room for other evils, or goods for that matter. It is an inclusive and exclusive wheel.&quot; 

One of his greatest works from this period is a series of murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, he painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville. Along the opposite wall he painted what he called the &quot;Seven Climates&quot;, in the sense of &quot;a belt of the earth&#x27;s surface contained between two given parallels of latitude.&quot; The Gulf Coast - Ocean Springs in particular - is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Around the same time, Anderson painted murals along the wooden walls of a padlocked room in his cottage at Shearwater. These murals, now called the Shearwater Cottage Murals, were discovered after his death and are inspired by Psalm 104. They are a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the &#x27;Walter Anderson Museum of Art.

When the Brooklyn Museum invited him to an exhibition of his linoleum block prints in 1948, he chose instead to travel to China, where he hoped to gaze upon unknown landscapes and examine Tibetan murals (the China trip ended, deep inland, when his passport and other belongings were stolen and Anderson returned, partly on foot, to his point of departure in Hong Kong.)

==Walter Anderson as a writer==
Among Anderson&#x27;s most vivid writings are logbooks recording his travels by bicycle to New York City (1942); New Orleans (1943); Texas (1945); China (1949); Costa Rica (1951); and Florida (1960); an account of his life among the pelican colonies of North Key, in the Chandeleurs; and about 90 journals of his trips to Horn Island, off the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, in which he combines close observation of the natural world with reflection on art and nature. Another noteworthy log describes a walking tour to a colony of sand- hill cranes north of Gautier, Mississippi, in January 1944.

==After Hurricane Katrina==
Anderson&#x27;s work (his family&#x27;s collection) was partially destroyed when Hurricane Katrina struck Ocean Springs in 2005, and the storm surge penetrated the small cinderblock building that had been built after Hurricane Camille to house safely those of his works owned by his family. There was extensive water damage to the watercolors, drawings, manuscripts, and other objects that were kept there, and much of this work, from the Anderson Family collection, was dried and removed to Mississippi State University. Some has been restored by conservator Margaret Moreland.

<text>Arturo Torres (born December 11, 1980) is an American soccer player, the first player in the history of Chivas USA of Major League Soccer.

Torres played college soccer at Loyola Marymount University from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, although he only started 13 of 18 games, Torres scored 16 goals and 4 assists, and was a first-team All-WCC selection. Torres had continued success in 2000, registering 11 goals and 10 assists, and was named the WCC Co-Player of the Year. As a junior, Torres was again a first-team All-WCC selection, after scoring 11 goals and 3 assists. As a senior, he scored 8 goals and 13 assists, and was named to the All-WCC first team for the fourth straight year. He finished his career at LMU with 46 goals and 22 assists.

Upon graduating, Torres was selected 19th overall by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft and signed to a developmental contract. In his first year, he appeared in nine games, starting three. In 2004, he appeared in 18 games, scoring a goal and two assists. Despite the meek numbers, Chivas USA made Torres the first official player in club history, drafting him first overall in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. He would go on to play 23 games for the club during the 2005 season, scoring 2 goals.

==Personal life==
Torres was born in the United States to Mexican parents.

<text>Baldet is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies in the lava-flooded region between the craters Cori to the north, Stoney to the southwest, and the worn walled plain Minkowski to the southeast.

The rim of Baldet is low and worn, but generally retains its original circular shape. There is a slight outward bulge along the northwest rim, and the western interior wall is wider than elsewhere.

The flat, nearly featureless interior has been flooded by lava, and has a lower albedo than the surroundings giving is a darker hue. A smaller crater has broken into the eastern rim, leaving a gap where the two craters intersect that has been covered in lava. A similar-sized crater with a fractured floor lies just inside the northern rim, producing a raised ring in the crater surface. A similar crater lies just outside the southern rim of Baldet.

The crater was named by the IAU in 1970 after French astronomer Fernand Baldet.

<text>Ball is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after British astronomer William Ball. The formation is circular and symmetrical, and has received little significant wear. The interior is rough-surfaced, curving downward toward the relatively wide central peak at the midpoint.

The crater is situated on the rim of the more sizable Deslandres, to the east of the crater Lexell, and southewest of Gauricus. To the north is Sasserides, and further to the north-northwest is the prominent ray crater Tycho.

<doc id="1159844" wikidata="Q1286395" url="?curid=1159844" title="I Am Kloot">
<text>I Am Kloot were an English rock band, formed in Manchester in 1999. The band was composed of vocalist/guitarist John Bramwell, bassist Peter Jobson and drummer Andy Hargreaves.

The band released six studio albums, and was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2010 for the album &quot;Sky at Night&quot;. The band split up in 2016, with Bramwell concentrating on a solo career.

The origin of the band name was shrouded in secrecy for the majority of the band&#x27;s existence, with Bramwell stating in 2013 that the band &quot;never said and we never will&quot; confirm the origin of the name and joked that &quot;If I told you, I&#x27;d have to kill you&quot;. Jobson later claimed that the name I Am Kloot was inspired by the Alan J. Pakula film &quot;Klute&quot;, and also that &quot;I Am Kloot is a left handed card game made famous in the diaries of Jerome K. Jerome&quot; – the rules of which are expounded in Jerome’s &quot;Three Men on the Bummel&quot;.

==History==
I Am Kloot were formed by members of The Mouth, a band co-fronted by John Bramwell and Bryan Glancy. Bramwell, who was born and brought up in Hyde, Cheshire, had previously played with bands including The Face Brothers (a band he was kicked out at the age of 18), The Ignition, Five Go Off To Play Guitar and The Debuchias, and performed solo as Johnny Dangerously. Peter Jobson moved from Morpeth, Northumberland to Manchester to study at Salford College (where he graduated with a BA Hons in Popular Music and Recording) and befriended Bramwell at The Night and Day Café, where they both ended up working for several years booking bands. Bramwell also ran an acoustic night at the venue called &quot;Acoustica Mancunia&quot; (and would continue hosting acoustic nights Gecko and Palookaville whilst the band got established). Jobson first saw Bramwell play at Castlefield Arena in central Manchester on 15 June 1996, the day of the IRA Bomb and ended up joining The Mouth who had released one single &quot;Bang&quot; the previous year, replacing the band&#x27;s original bassist Simon Burns. The band split with Glancy after he went on holiday a week before a tour and did not return for three weeks. They began working on Bramwell&#x27;s songs and changed their name to I Am Kloot.

The band released their debut double A-Side single &quot;Titanic/To You&quot; in November 1999 on local label Ugly Man Records, which was advertised around Manchester city centre with posters bearing just the lyric &quot;there&#x27;s blood on your legs, I love you&quot; daubed in red ink, leading to complaints in the local press. Guy Lovelady, the owner of Ugly Man Records had rung Bramwell about getting one of his acts to play Night and Day, but he refused to discuss it after having fallen out with the venues owner and instead sought to get the band&#x27;s debut single released on the label. Lovelady agreed without hearing any material, and did not actually hear the single until after it had been released and first saw the band play live two months later at The Kashmir Klub in London with The Libertines supporting. The band borrowed £1,000 to release the single and packaged the records in brown paper bags instead of proper sleeves to save money.

The band released their second double A-Side single &quot;Twist/86 TV&#x27;s&quot; in March 2000 on Ugly Man before signing to Wall of Sound imprint &quot;We Love You&quot; to release their debut album &quot;Natural History&quot; in March 2001. Having decided against recording the album in the band&#x27;s rehearsal space in Jobson&#x27;s basement, it was recorded with Elbow frontman Guy Garvey in a church on the Isle of Mull. Despite being heralded by the NME as figureheads of the so-called New Acoustic Movement (although Bramwell did not want to admit to there being an acoustic scene at the time &quot;because of the labels that immediately get attached to ‘acoustic music’&quot;), the band returned home from touring to find the label had gone bust, owing the band money. The album went out of print in the UK, which Bramwell later described as a stalling moment for the band, but was still available in Europe due to it being distributed by a different label, so the band toured Holland, Germany and France instead of focusing on the UK.

Following two years of contractual problems, the band signed to The Echo Label and released their self-titled second album &quot;I Am Kloot&quot; in September 2003 with Bramwell stating that the band did not &quot;fit into the current Strokes/White Stripes rock thing, so we&#x27;re out on a limb again.&quot; The album was produced by Chris Potter, with Ian Broudie producing one song, &quot;Life in a Day&quot;. Despite originally planning to release &quot;Proof&quot; as a single to promote the album, going as far as approving artwork and track listing, as well as commissioning a promo video starring Christopher Eccleston, it ended up not receiving a commercial release in the UK. Instead, the promo video was made available through the band&#x27;s website and only received a physical release in the Benelux countries on the PIAS record label. At the time, Bramwell claimed that the single was not released properly as they &quot;didn’t want to do any singles any more&quot;, but later admitted that the record label refused to release it.

The band released their third album &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; in April 2005 via The Echo Label. The album was recorded at Moolah Rouge Studios in Stockport with Joe Robinson, who had previously worked with Badly Drawn Boy and Alfie. During sessions for the album, they placed microphones everywhere, commenting that they &quot;were miking up things that were vibrating because we were playing. If you’ve got a tabletop with cups and saucers on it, it might vibrate when you play a certain note, and not when you play others. So you mike up the tabletop, and play the song, and on certain notes you get these strange sounds&quot; and added that they &quot;kept it sparse, not layering it up so much as adding colour&quot;. Bramwell proclaimed that &quot;something clicked in the last 12 months, I felt as if the band had just begun, as if we&#x27;d sprung from the head of Zeus in Full body armour&quot;, yet later claimed that he &quot;got the shakes around Gods and Monsters. I was over-thinking, not going with my instincts writing-wise&quot;.

In August 2005, the band parted ways with The Echo Label after it &quot;became clear the label were unable to sustain the band&#x27;s financial backing&quot;. It transpired that the label&#x27;s parent company, the Chrysalis Group had announced a restructuring of The Echo Label after announcing a loss of over £2.0 million, resulting in a change of direction at the label and dropping many of its roster including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Stands, with I Am Kloot jumping before they were pushed.

On 21 November 2005, the band released the Guy Garvey/Craig Potter produced stand-alone single &quot;Maybe I Should&quot; via their own label, Skinny Dog Records. The single followed a short UK tour, which saw the band play their biggest headlining shows to date, culminating with a show at the London Astoria.

In October 2006, the band released BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions, a compilation of session tracks that were recorded for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio One programme over two sessions in 2001 and 2004.

Without a record deal, the band began work on their fourth album at Moolah Rouge Studios in early 2006, with Jobson describing the recording set up in May of that year as being &quot;quite relaxed. When it feels right we record and hopefully that mood will pervade the album&quot; and revealed that they were working with the studios owners Colin &amp; Norman McLeod who also played live with the band, and added that &quot;the atmosphere in the studio with them is inspiring&quot;. The band premiered several new songs at Manchester Academy in November 2006. However, these recordings were ditched in 2007, with the band choosing to record the songs over three days live in the studio with no overdubs, treating the recording as a gig. To reflect the live nature of the recordings, the album was released as &quot;I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge&quot;, initially as a limited edition hand numbered 2000 copy CD in November 2007 at three shows at Manchester Academy (the same venue where they previewed some of the songs a year previous), before receiving a full commercial release through Skinny Dog Records on 14 April 2008 with an additional DVD featuring a documentary on the band from the now defunct Channel M station. The album was dedicated to former bandmate and friend Bryan Glancy who died in January 2006, with Bramwell revealing that &quot;lots of the lyrics on the album come from conversations with Bryan&quot;. Bramwell also commented that the band &quot;might have returned to something that we had initially, which we all think is maybe quite a good idea&quot;. It was revealed in November 2008 that film director Danny Boyle, who had used the band&#x27;s song &quot;Avenue Of Hope&quot; on the closing credits to his film &quot;Sunshine&quot; the previous year, had approached the band to develop an original musical with them.

In October 2009, the band released a double album compilation of B-sides, rarities and previously unreleased songs under the title &quot;B&quot;.

The band released their fifth album, &quot;Sky at Night&quot; on 5 July 2010 through Shepherd Moon Records/EMI Label Services. The album was originally intended to be released in Autumn 2009, with recording sessions having begun in January that year, but was delayed due to Moolah Rouge Studios going into liquidation and disrupting recording. Album sessions were finished at Blueprint Studios in Salford and produced by Craig Potter and Guy Garvey, with Bramwell shattering his elbow at Big Hands bar on Oxford Road, Manchester whilst celebrating completion of the album. Having taken 60 days in the studio to record over a 12-month period, with long gaps in between sessions, Bramwell revealed that taking so long to record the album had meant that they had been unable to tour and were &quot;all skint because of it&quot;. The album resulted in &quot;the greatest sales and acclaim&quot; of the band&#x27;s career, with Jobson noting that the album &quot;was definitely where things went up a gear, in the UK at least. We got played on the radio, which had never happened before, and then to be nominated for the Mercury was massive for a band like us – we’ve always been about word of mouth&quot; and admitting that prior to the album being released, that &quot;after 10 years of gigging and working hard, we basically had nothing at all - no manager, label, money, we were pretty fucked up to be honest&quot;. Bramwell described the album as &quot;a bit of a sidestep; a one-off, single-themed, late-night, romantic LP&quot;.

The band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Let It All In&quot; on 21 January 2013, and was preceded by a live stream of the album on the &quot;Guardian&quot; website. Less orchestrated than &quot;Sky at Night&quot;, the album was recorded initially as a 3-piece, with the recordings finalised over 6 weeks with producers Garvey and Potter. On the song &quot;Bullets&quot; Bramwell can be heard singing with a lisp, initially claiming to have lost several teeth during a speedboat accident in the south of France, Bramwell later admitted that his teeth just started falling out. The album featured the eventual release of the song &quot;Even The Stars&quot;, which was regularly played live prior to the release of &quot;I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge&quot;, but was omitted from that album. It was then set to feature on &quot;Sky At Night&quot;, with Bramwell stating that the song was &quot;almost like a single. The thing with singles is they tend to not have all the Kloot elements in them because they’ve got too poppy. But this song has got a real hook, it’s still got a lot of the soul and ghostliness that all Kloot songs should have&quot;, but was then omitted from that album too. The version eventually released is much slower than previous versions, with Bramwell admitting that the band had &quot;tried recording it in many different ways; I think we’ve finally found one that works in a Kloot way. There are some more exciting live versions of it that we’ve done, but when we tried recording it previously it didn’t work&quot;.

In May 2013, the band announced their biggest headline show to date, which was held at the O2 Apollo Manchester venue in December 2013, and fans were asked by the band to submit song requests.

In 2014, the band scored the incidental music for the BBC One television miniseries &quot;From There to Here&quot;, with the first episode aired 22 May. The soundtrack album will be released on 24 November 2014 on Caroline Records. The music was composed and recorded by the band members individually, with them not having seen each other since December 2013. In down time from the band, Jobson toured Europe with singer-songwriter Nadine Shah and Bramwell undertook a UK solo acoustic tour.

In July 2014, Jobson revealed that the band&#x27;s &quot;last 2 albums have been very elaborate and our business set up has been very corporate. Although that has brought benefits it has also distracted us from what Kloot is about. Some of the most commercially successful things we have done have been artistically and personally the most unrewarding&quot; and added that this period had &quot;taken its toll on our relationship. We were doing something we didn´t want to do. It took a while to find that out. We were pretty sick for a while there.&quot;

The band released the live album &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; on 13 April 2015 via Walk Tall Recordings / PIAS.

The band performed in June 2016 as part of the &#x27;Guy Garvey&#x27;s Cultural Meltdown&#x27; at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Prior to that, the band had not played or met up together for over 12 months.

In November 2017, Bramwell revealed that the band had split up, stating that &quot;there was no heavy break-up or anything. I just wanted to do something else. I&#x27;ll never say never to getting back together but I was in I Am Kloot most of my adult life, but just as you can go to a great place on holiday year after year, sooner or later you want to go to somewhere else&quot;. He later added that &quot;the real reason I’ve gone solo is because I started as a finger-style classical and folk guitarist. It was great to be in a band, but at the end of the day it doesn’t really work in that format. It needs to be exposed&quot;.

==Post-split==
Bassist Pete Jobson now resides full time in London with his actor wife and his young family.

Around 2017, drummer Andy Hargreaves was playing live with singer-songwriter Matt Skinner.

John Bramwell continued his solo career. See more: John Bramwell.

The indie rock band 86tvs (Felix White, Hugo White, Will White and Jamie Morrison) is named after the song of the same name from I Am Kloot&#x27;s debut album, inspired by the White brothers&#x27; love of the band in childhood.

==Awards==
&quot;Sky at Night&quot; was shortlisted for the 2010 Barclaycard Mercury Music Prize. In response to the nomination, Bramwell stated: &quot;I thought we&#x27;d be out of, off people&#x27;s radar enough, that they wouldn&#x27;t have, kind of, noticed. One of the factors why they actually did pay attention to this record is the fact that Guy [Garvey] and Craig [Potter] produced it.&quot;

<text>James Archibald McLarnin (19 December 1907 – 28 October 2004) was an Irish professional boxer who became a two-time welterweight world champion and an International Boxing Hall of Fame inductee.

As of December 2024, BoxRec ranks McLarnin as the second greatest pound for pound fighter of all time, only behind Sugar Ray Robinson.

==Background==
There was often confusion over McLarnin&#x27;s exact place of birth and his date of birth. McLarnin himself was unsure as to the exact location and at various times claimed to be born in Inchicore, Dublin, in modern-day Ireland, or the Lisburn Road in Belfast, Ireland, modern day Northern Ireland. Adding to the confusion he went by nicknames the &quot;Dublin Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Belfast Spider&quot;. It was Irish boxing historian Patrick Myler who later unearthed McLarnin&#x27;s birth certificate which showed that McLarnin was born in Hillsborough, County Down, Ireland in 1907.

McLarnin&#x27;s father, Sam McLarnin, a Methodist from Dublin, was described as &#x27;a typical Dublin Irishman&#x27; and traveled throughout Britain and Ireland for work as a butcher. He later married Mary Ferris from Belfast and they settled in County Down before being drawn into Belfast. When McLarnin was three years of age the whole family emigrated to Saskatchewan, Canada via Liverpool. The McLarnins started out as a wheat farmers, but years later, at the age of 10 and following a particularly harsh winter, the family moved to Vancouver where they opened a second-hand clothes store in Vancouver&#x27;s east end.

McLarnin was a prodigious athlete, his main sports were football, baseball and boxing and was considered a model of propriety by Rev. A.E. Roberts at the Methodist mission in Vancouver. He took up boxing at the age of 10 after getting into a fight defending his newspaper-selling pitch. Former professional boxer Charles &quot;Pop&quot; Foster recognized McLarnin&#x27;s talent at the age of 13. He constructed a makeshift gym for McLarnin to train in, sure that he would one day be the champion of the world. The two of them would remain close, and when Foster died, he left everything he had to McLarnin.

==Boxing career==
Following a successful start to his career in Vancouver, McLarnin&#x27;s grew aggrieved at the low pay he was receiving for bouts and decided to move south. &quot;We had to go to the United States to make our money. We owe Vancouver nothing&quot; said McLarnin.

Foster took McLarnin to San Francisco, where his youthful appearance made it difficult to get a fight until he lied about his age. It is for this reason that McLarnin was known as the &quot;Baby-faced Assassin&quot;. Despite his youthful appearance, McLarnin had incredible power with both fists, his right being particularly feared. However, like many similar fighters McLarnin suffered several hand injuries throughout his career. Towards the end of his career McLarnin was forced to become more of a scientific boxer to reduce further injuries to his hands.

McLarnin lost his first title shot on 21 May 1928 in New York against world lightweight champion Sammy Mandell. However, he did go on to beat him twice in the following two years. It would be five years before McLarnin would next get a title shot, during which time he knocked out gifted Jewish fighters Al Singer, Ruby Goldstein, and Sid Terris.

McLarnin&#x27;s second title shot came against welterweight champion Young Corbett III. McLarnin won by knockout after only 2 minutes 37 seconds. Following his title success, McLarnin fought an epic three-fight series with Barney Ross. The first fight, on 28 May 1934, was won by Ross, but McLarnin regained his title in their next match four months later. In the deciding fight on 28 May 1935, McLarnin lost his title for the final time in a narrow decision.

McLarnin retired in November 1936 still at the top of his game, having won his last two fights against all-time greats Tony Canzoneri and Lou Ambers. His record was 54 wins, 11 losses, and 3 draws in 68 contests. In 1996 &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; voted McLarnin the fifth-greatest welterweight of all time.

==Life after boxing==
McLarnin never returned to the ring despite large incentives for him to do so. Unlike many boxers, McLarnin invested his money wisely and retired a wealthy man. He opened an electrical goods store, and also did some acting, golfing, and lecturing.

In 1937, he appeared with boxers Maxie Rosenbloom, James J. Jeffries, Jack Dempsey, and Jackie Fields, in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Big City&quot;, a film involving rough competition between two rival taxi companies.

In 1938, he appeared in a background gymnasium scene for the successful 1938, MGM boxing movie, &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; with boxers Abe &quot;The Newsboy&quot; Hollandersky, Joe Glick, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jack Roper, and Tommy Herman.

In 1946, he appeared in Monogram Pictures&#x27; boxing movie, &quot;Joe Palooka, Champ&quot;, with cameos by real boxing greats Joe Louis, Henry Armstrong, Ceferino Garcia, and Manuel Ortiz. Heavyweight Jack Roper appeared as the character Waldo. The simple plot involved young boxer Joe and his girl resisting mob influence while Joe trains to fight the champ.

==Death==
McLarnin died on 28 October 2004 at the age of 96 in Richland, Washington. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Banachiewicz is a largely degraded lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. 

==Geography==

Banachiewicz crater is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is largely degraded. Portions of the western and southwest rim still survive as low ridges in the surface, while the remainder is a jumble of irregular terrain with little definition. It was named after Polish astronomer Tadeusz Banachiewicz. Due to its location, this crater appears very foreshortened to an earthbound viewer. The visibility is more than partly affected by libration, which can at times completely conceal this formation from view.

There are two small impact craters of note within the interior: Banachiewicz B is adjacent to the western rim, while the smaller, former Banachiewicz F crater—renamed by the IAU as &quot;Knox-Shaw&quot;—lies on the eastern floor of the walled inner plain. It is located closer to the midpoint, and 12 km in circumference. It was named after British astronomer Harold Knox-Shaw. Knox-Shaw is a bowl-shaped formation of the type that is found over much of the lunar surface. The rim is circular and the inner walls slope down to a small interior floor at the midpoint. It is not significantly eroded and has no other distinguishing features.

Just to the northeast of this formation is the large walled plain Neper, which lies on the southern edge of Mare Marginis. The crater Schubert is located to the south of Banachiewicz, while Schubert E is attached to the exterior of the western rim.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Banachiewicz.

<text>Barbier is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It forms a matched pair with Cyrano to the north-northwest, and it lies to the southeast of the huge walled plain Gagarin. Southwest of Barbier is the crater Sierpinski, and to the southeast is the Mare Ingenii.

The outer rim of Barbier has been eroded somewhat by subsequent impacts, particularly at the north end where the wall has been degraded by several small craterlets. A small crater lies across the eastern rim, and the southern rim is wider and irregular in shape. An unusual irregular crater (Barbier F) with a hummocky floor, approximately 16 km long, lies near where a central peak would be located, offset to the east of the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barbier.

<text>Barkla is a lunar impact crater that lies near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is located to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus, and was formerly designated Langrenus A before being renamed by the IAU in 1979. Due east of Barkla is Kapteyn, a formation only slightly larger with a similar size. Southwest of Barkla is the crater Lamé.

The rim of Barkla is very nearly circular, although it is slightly elongated to the northeast and southwest. The wall shows little appearance of erosion from subsequent impacts, and is not overlain by any craterlets of note. At the midpoint of the floor is a central peak, which joins a low ridge running to the south and northeast.

<doc id="1159860" wikidata="Q1356241" url="?curid=1159860" title="What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)">
<text>What&#x27;s Up, Doc? is a 1972 American screwball comedy film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O&#x27;Neal. It was intended to pay homage to comedy films of the 1920s, &#x27;30s, and &#x27;40s, especially &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny cartoons.

&quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; was a success, and became the third highest-grossing film of 1972. It won the Writers Guild of America (WGA) 1973 &quot;Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen&quot; award for Buck Henry, David Newman, and Robert Benton. &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; was ranked number 61 on the list of the 100 greatest American comedies published by the American Film Institute (AFI), number 68 on the AFI&#x27;s list of 100 greatest love stories in American cinema, and number 58 on the list of the WGA&#x27;s 101 Funniest Screenplays published by the Writers Guild of America. The film was very loosely based on the 1971 novel &quot;A Glimpse of Tiger&quot; by Herman Raucher – only a few character traits were used.

==Plot==
Dr. Howard Bannister, a musicologist from the Iowa Conservatory of Music in Ames, Iowa, has travelled to San Francisco to compete for a research grant offered by Frederick Larrabee. Howard is accompanied by his tightly wound, overbearing fiancée Eunice Burns. As the two check into the Hotel Bristol, Howard runs into the charming trouble-magnet Judy Maxwell in the hotel&#x27;s drugstore. She never finished college, but nevertheless has amassed a considerable amount of knowledge from all of the academic institutions from which she was expelled. She begins to pursue Howard and lodges herself in the hotel without paying.

Howard has brought with him a plaid overnight bag containing igneous &quot;tambula&quot; rocks that have certain musical properties, unaware that three other parties are staying on the same floor of the Bristol with identical bags. The mysterious &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; has illegally obtained a bag containing top-secret government papers, which government agent &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; is on a mission to recover. Wealthy socialite Mrs. Van Hoskins has a bag containing her sizable collection of valuable jewels that hotel employees Harry and Fritz attempt to steal. Judy&#x27;s bag is filled with her clothing and a large dictionary. Over the course of the evening, the four parties unwittingly take one another&#x27;s bags.

Judy, masquerading as Eunice at the musicologists&#x27; banquet, uses her humor, wit, and academic knowledge to charm everyone except Howard&#x27;s Croatian competitor, Hugh Simon. Unable to overcome Judy&#x27;s pretense—and realizing Larrabee&#x27;s infatuation with her might win him the grant—Howard denies knowing the real Eunice when she hysterically tries to enter the banquet. Judy later intrudes into Howard&#x27;s hotel room. His struggle to hide her presence from Eunice while the thieves attempt to recover the jewels lead to a fire and the destruction of the room. Ultimately, Howard ends up with the jewels, Judy with the documents, Mr. Smith with Judy&#x27;s clothes, and the thieves with the rocks.

The following day, everyone makes their way to a reception in Larrabee&#x27;s upscale Victorian home, where a fight breaks out involving guns, furnishings, and thrown pies. Howard and Judy take all four bags and flee through San Francisco, first on a delivery bike, and then in a decorated Volkswagen Beetle stolen from a wedding party, pursued by Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones and the jewel thieves, who also have taken Eunice, Larrabee and Simon hostage. They go through Chinatown disrupting a parade, down Lombard Street, through a panel of glass, through wet cement, and eventually into San Francisco Bay at the ferry landing, after causing several collisions.

Everyone ends up in a courtroom, where Judge Maxwell, already on the brink of a nervous breakdown, tries to clear up the matter but only succeeds in finding his daughter Judy as the cause of all the trouble. Later, after the bags have been returned to their rightful owners, Howard and Judy find themselves at the airport again. &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; is pursuing &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, who is now back in possession of the government papers, while the thieves plan their escape from the country. Mrs. Van Hoskins pays for the considerable damage and splits the remaining $50 of the reward she had offered among those who helped retrieve her jewels. Eunice appears with Larrabee and Simon, who won the grant. However, he is exposed by Judy as a plagiarist, thus getting Howard the grant after all. Eunice leaves Howard for Larrabee.

Howard boards a plane back to Iowa alone, only to find Judy in the seat behind him. He declares his love for her and apologizes for what he said earlier. Judy responds, &quot;Love means never having to say you&#x27;re sorry&quot;, to which Howard replies, &quot;That&#x27;s the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; As the two kiss, a scene from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; is screened on the plane.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development and writing===


===Filming===
Polly Platt, Bogdanovich&#x27;s former wife, was the production designer.

The opening and ending scenes were filmed at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in the South Terminal (now Terminal 1). The opening scene was filmed in the downstairs TWA Baggage Claim area, and the next to last scene was filmed in the upstairs departure area beneath the arrival/departure board and at the flight insurance counter.

The San Francisco Hilton was the shooting location for the Bristol Hotel. The exterior of the hotel, where Streisand is hanging from a ledge, was shot in Westwood, Los Angeles. The view from the Bristol Hotel, looking down, is from the Saint Francis Hotel looking at Geary Street.

The San Francisco setting was chosen to allow an elaborate comic spoof of the San Francisco car chase in the hit 1968 film &quot;Bullitt&quot;. Bogdanovich claims the rousing chase sequence accounted for one-fourth of the film&#x27;s $4 million budget. The classic &quot;plate glass&quot; scene, in which O&#x27;Neal and Streisand are pedaling on a stolen grocery store delivery bicycle, was filmed at Balboa and 23rd Avenue in the Richmond District. In another scene, their out of control bike goes down Clay Street in Chinatown. The Volkswagen Beetle is stolen from the curb in front of Saint Peter and Paul Church at Washington Square Park, and the Beetle hides on a car carrier on Sacramento Street just west of Van Ness Avenue, in an area where many car dealerships were once located (Van Ness was San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Auto Row&quot;). The production did not have permission from the city to drive cars down the concrete steps in Alta Plaza Park in San Francisco; these were badly damaged during filming and still show the scars today. At the end of the car chase, almost everyone ends up foundering in San Francisco Bay—except O&#x27;Neal and Streisand, comfortably afloat in the Volkswagen Beetle. During the making of this scene, the actor Sorrell Booke almost drowned in the Bay.

The final scene on board a TWA Boeing 707 shows O&#x27;Neal looking out the righthand window showing the Marina District and the Embarcadero Freeway.

==Music==

As with &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, all the music is diegetic; there is no underscoring anywhere in the film.

Although &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; is not a musical, it contains some singing and other musical moments. The song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot; from the musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot; is sung as a solo during the opening credits by Streisand, and as a duet during the closing credits by Streisand and O&#x27;Neal. The same Cole Porter musical supplied at least two other tunes played as background music: &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;, heard during the first hotel lobby scene.

&quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot; is whistled by the Streisand character as she crosses the street, following the pizza delivery man, into the Bristol Hotel before the first hotel lobby scene.

About two-thirds of the way into the film, Howard accompanies Judy at a piano (on a floor of the Hotel Bristol apparently under construction or renovation) as she sings the beginning of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (made famous in the film &quot;Casablanca&quot;). The scene includes Streisand imitating Humphrey Bogart with the line, &quot;Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, he walks into mine. Play it, Sam.&quot;

Musical in-jokes appear throughout the film. Over-the-top Muzak-styled elevator music featuring Cole Porter&#x27;s songs is used throughout the hotel elevator scenes. In the chase scene, a Chinese marching band is inexplicably playing the Mexican tune &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; (although, in certain prints, it sounds more like &quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot;) on German glockenspiels. At the American Musicologists&#x27; banquet, themes from Thoinot Arbeau&#x27;s &quot;Orchésographie&quot; can be heard in the background, incongruously played on a Hammond organ and a sitar.

George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Someone to Watch over Me&quot; is whistled by Streisand outside the hotel drug store.

The Bugs Bunny number—derived from his characteristic tagline—that gives the movie its title, appears as well, with the original animation, in the last scene. Instrumental versions of &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Talk About Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, an old Tin Pan Alley hit that had appeared in the Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;One Froggy Evening,&quot; are background music during the opening scene in the airport.

==Release==
The film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 9, 1972.

Novelization:

===Home media===
&quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; was originally released on VHS in 1982.

As part of a collector&#x27;s box set of Streisand&#x27;s films, it was released on DVD in July 2003 and then on Blu-ray in August 2010.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $66 million against a budget of $4 million. It became the third highest-grossing film of the year, ranking behind &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Barbra Streisand was never more likable than in this energetic, often hilarious screwball farce from director Peter Bogdanovich.&quot;

In his review of &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, notoriously caustic critic John Simon (upon whom, according to director Bogdanovich, the character of Hugh Simon was based) said that Barbra Streisand &quot;look[ed] like a cross between an aardvark and an albino rat surmounted by a platinum-coated horse bun,&quot; and called the film a heavy-handed attempt at nostalgia.

The film was re-released in the United States in 1973 and earned an additional $3 million in theatrical rentals and in 1975, earning an additional $6 million.

===Accolades===
The film won the Writers Guild of America 1973 &quot;Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen&quot; award for writers Buck Henry, David Newman and Robert Benton. Madeline Kahn was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – No. 61
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – No. 68

<text>John Foster Williams (12 October 1743 – 24 June 1814) was an American mariner who served as an officer in the Massachusetts State Navy during the American Revolutionary War and later an officer in the Revenue-Marine.

==Career==
Williams was commissioned a captain in the Navy of Massachusetts and received command of the brig &quot;Hazard&quot; late in 1777. In the following year, he took her to sea in a fruitless search for British West Indiamen; but he and his ship eventually achieved success in 1779. While cruising in the West Indies, &quot;Hazard&quot; fell in with the privateer brigantine &quot;Active&quot; on 16 March. At the end of a &quot;smart action&quot; of 35-minutes&#x27; duration, &quot;yard arm to yard arm,&quot; &quot;Active&quot; struck her colors and became &quot;Hazard&#x27;s&quot; prize, after having suffered 13 killed and 20 wounded out of her 95-man crew. &quot;Hazard&quot; sent the captured brigantine back to Massachusetts under a prize crew and subsequently returned home in April, after taking several other prizes. 
In May, &quot;Hazard&quot; returned to sea, this time in company with the brig &quot;Tyrannicide&quot;. At 0830 on 15 June, the two ships fell in with two British ships and—after a short, sharp engagement—forced both enemy vessels to strike their colors. Later that summer, &quot;Hazard&quot;—like the rest of the Massachusetts Navy—took part in the ill-fated Penobscot expedition, an operation which eventually cost the state&#x27;s navy all of its commissioned vessels. 

Williams received command of the new 20 gun frigate &quot;Protector&quot; in the spring of 1780 and took her to sea in June. In accordance with instructions from the Board of War, the new warship cruised in the vicinity of the Newfoundland Banks, on the lookout for British merchantmen. Her vigilance was rewarded early in June. 

At 0700 on 9 June 1780, &quot;Protector&quot; spotted a strange ship bearing down on her, flying British colors. At 1100, the Continental frigate, also flying English colors, hailed the stranger and found her to be the 32-gun letter-of-marque &quot;Admiral Duff&quot;, bound for London from St. Kitts. When the enemy&#x27;s identity had been ascertained, &quot;Protector&quot; hauled down British colors and ran up the Continental flag—opening fire almost simultaneously. The action ensued for the next hour and one-half, until &quot;Admiral Duff&quot; caught fire and exploded, leaving 55 survivors for Protector to rescue soon thereafter.

With the coming of peace, Williams returned to his native Boston. Because of rampant smuggling and the need for enforcement of tariff laws, upon the urging of Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, the United States Congress created the Revenue-Marine on 4 August 1790. Under the enabling legislation that authorized the Revenue-Marine, a &quot;System of Cutters&quot;, consisting of ten ships, were initially ordered and constructed. John Foster Williams was commissioned as a Revenue-Marine officer by President George Washington 21 March 1791 and given oversight of construction of the cutter &quot;Massachusetts&quot; which he later commanded. After &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was determined to be too slow for her assigned tasks she was decommissioned and &quot;Massachusetts II&quot; was constructed and commissioned in 1793; Williams was chosen as master.

==Later life and death==
Williams died in Boston on 24 June 1814.

<text>James Endicott (May 8, 1865 – March 9, 1954) was a Canadian church leader, missionary and administrator. 

==Life and career==
Endicott was born in Devon, England. He emigrated to Canada with his family at the age of seventeen and grew up in a farming community on the Canadian Prairies. 

Endicott studied at Wesley College in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1893. He was elected Moderator of the United Church of Canada by the 2nd General Council in Montreal, Quebec, in 1926.

Endicott and his wife moved to Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, in 1894 as missionaries and were integral to the development of the Methodist mission already in place there. He was very influenced by the social gospel movement and was greatly impacted by the plight of the poor and oppressed he encountered while in China. The Endicotts and their five children returned to Canada in 1910 due to the poor health of their youngest daughter and settled in Toronto where James Endicott became General Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church of Canada in 1913. He continued in this position after union with the United Church of Canada until his retirement in 1937.

Endicott was a leading figure in efforts to merge the Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches leading to the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925. He served as Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 1926 to 1928. He was recommended highly to this position by his predecessor, George C. Pidgeon, because of his dedication to and enthusiasm for missionary work. He also served as head of the Foreign Missions Board of the United Church from its founding until his retirement in 1937 and remained a leading figure in the denomination until the end of his life. His son, James Gareth Endicott, was also a minister and missionary in China and was close friends with Lester B. Pearson.

<doc id="1159873" wikidata="Q2587183" url="?curid=1159873" title="Nammalvar">
<text>Nammalvar was one of the twelve Alvar saints of Tamil Nadu, India, who are known for their affiliation to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism. The verses of the Alvars are compiled as the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, where praises are sung of 108 temples that are classified as divine realms, called the Divya Desams. Nammalvar is considered to be the fifth in the line of the twelve Alvars. He is highly regarded as a great mystic of the Vaishnava tradition. He is also considered to be the foremost among the twelve Alvars, and his contributions amount to 1352 among the 4000 stanzas in the &quot;Naalayira Divya Prabandam&quot;.

According to traditional scriptures, Nammalvar was born in 3059 BCE in Alwarthirunagiri; historically he flourished in 8th century CE. In Hindu legends, Nammalvar remained speechless from the moment of his birth, sitting under a tamarind tree when he first interacted with Madhurakavi Alvar, who saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing.

The works of Nammalvar were compiled by Madhurakavi as four different works, the &quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot; (1,102 verses), &quot;Tiruviruttam&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Tiruvaciriyam&quot; (or Tiru Asiriyam - 7 verses) and &quot;Periya Tiruvantati&quot; (87 verses). The works of Nammalvar contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism.

The Garudasevai festival in Nava Tirupati, the nine Vishnu temples in the Thoothukudi region, and the Araiyar Sevai during the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival of the Srirangam temple are dedicated to him. The verses of Nammalvar and other Alvars are recited as a part of daily prayers and during festive occasions in several Vaishnava temples in Tamil Nadu.

==Alvars==

The word &quot;alvar&quot; means the one who dives deep into the ocean of the countless attributes of god. The Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, songs of love and devotion, are compiled as &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandham&quot; containing 4000 verses and the 108 temples revered in their songs are classified as Divya Desam. The saints had different origins and belonged to different castes. As per history, the first three &quot;alvars&quot;, Poigai Alvar, Bhoothath Alvar and Pey Alvar were born miraculously. Thirumalisai Alvar was the son of a sage, Thondaradippodi Alvar, Madhurakavi Alvar, Periyalvar and Andal were from the Brahmin community, Kulashekhara Alvar was a kshatriya, Nammalvar was a Vellala, Thiruppaan Alvar was a paanar and Thirumangai Alvar was a &quot;kallar&quot;. The &quot;Divya Suri Charitra&quot; by Garuda-Vahana Pandita (11th century), &quot;Guruparamparaprabhavam&quot; by Pinbaragiya Perumal Jiyar, &quot;Periya tiru mudi adaivu&quot; by Anbillai Kandadiappan, &quot;Yatindra Pranava Prabavam&quot; by Pillai Lokacharya, commentaries on &quot;Divya Prabandam&quot;, Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts, temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the &quot;alvars&quot; and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu. Poigai is considered an incarnation of &quot;Panchajanya&quot; (Krishna&#x27;s conch), Bhoothath of &quot;Kaumodakee&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s Mace/Club), Pey of &quot;Nandaka&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s sword), Thirumalisai of &quot;Sudarshanam&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s discus), Namm of &quot;Vishvaksena&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s commander), Madhurakavi of &quot;Vainatheya&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s eagle, Garuda), Kulasekhara of &quot;Kaustubha&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s necklace), Periya of Garuda (Vishnu&#x27;s eagle), Andal of Bhoodevi (Vishnu&#x27;s wife, Lakshmi, in her form as Bhudevi), Thondaradippodi of &quot;Vanamaalai&quot; (Vishnu&#x27;s garland), Thiruppaan of &quot;Srivatsa&quot; (An auspicious mark on Vishnu&#x27;s chest) and Thirumangai of Sharanga, Rama&#x27;s bow. The songs of &quot;Prabandam&quot; are regularly sung in all the Vishnu temples of South India daily and also during festivals.

According to a traditional account by Manavala Mamunigal, the first three &quot;alvars,&quot; namely Poigai, Bhoothath and Pey, belong to the Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BCE). It is widely accepted by tradition and historians that the trio are the earliest among the twelve &quot;alvars&quot;. The &quot;alvars&quot; were also instrumental in promoting the Bhagavatha cult and the two epics of India, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The &quot;alvars&quot; were instrumental in spreading Vaishnavism throughout the region. The verses of the various &quot;alvars&quot; were compiled by Nathamuni (824-924 CE), a 10th-century Vaishnava theologian, who called it the &quot;Tamil Veda&quot;.

==Early life==

According to traditional scriptures, Nammalvar was born on the 43rd Kali in 3059 BCE as an amsha of Vishvaksena, Vishnu&#x27;s army commander. He was born at Thirukurukur (modern day Alwarthirunagiri) in the southernmost region of the Tamil country. Many sources regard him to have been born to a princely Vellalar family of Shudra status (To prove world that &quot;caste is not based on birth and it is based on action&quot;). Some caste associations claim him to be a Vaishya, like the All India Vaishya Samaj in 1988. P. Jayaraman in his book &quot;A Brief History of Vaishnava Saint Poets: The Alwars&quot; where he mentions that Nammalwar belongs to Vellalar, a Vaishya caste. Nammalvar&#x27;s grandfather, Tiruvalmarban Pillai, is a Vellalar and comes under the Vaishya Caste. J. V. Chelliah a popular Tamil scholar who translated the Ten Idylls into English states that Paṭṭiṉappālai (Commonly dated between 1st to 2nd Century CE) has mentions that Vellalars belonged to the &quot;Vysya caste&quot;, They followed the 4 Vedas, they were commonly involved in agriculture, taking care of cattle, trade and other business pursuits.

Tradition says that he must have been born fully enlightened because as a baby he never cried or suckled and never opened his eyes. According to legend, as a child he responded to no external stimuli and his parents left him at the feet of the deity of Sri Adhinathar in Alwarthirunagari. The child then got up and climbed into a hole in a tamarind, sat in the lotus position, and began to meditate. It appears he was in this state for as long as sixteen years when a Tamil poet and scholar named Madhurakavi Alvar was born in Thirukolur (who was elder to him by age) and had travelled to North India on a temple trip. As he was performing his Nityaanushtanam (daily rituals) one day, he saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing. Unable to elicit any reaction from the child, he asked him a riddle: &quot;If the small is born in a dead&#x27;s body (or stomach), what will it eat and where will it stay?&quot; meaning, if the subtle soul is embodied in the gross body, what are its actions and thoughts? Nammalvar broke his lifelong silence and responded, &quot;That it will eat, it will rest!&quot; meaning that if the soul identifies with the body, it will be the body but if it serves the divine, it will stay in Vaikuntha and eat (think) of God. Madhurakavi Alvar realized the divinity of this child.

It is believed that in the Kali Yuga, the doors of Vaikuntham (The abode Of Vishnu) was opened first time for him by Narayana himself and it is believed that the followers of Swami Nammalvar have the most easy access to the supreme abode. Following his moksha his family entitle as the Subbiah Kumara Pillai by holy Vaishnava acharyas and they serve him and believe him to be Sriman Narayana Tiruvadi. After the passing of Nammalvar, Madhurakavi Alvar composed 10 pasrams called Kanninin Sirutambu. He gave a word that whoever reads this 11,000 times with devotion will get vision and blessings of Nammalvar whenever they visit his abode at Alvarthirunagari.

Nammalvar was one of the twelve alvar poet-saints who immersed themselves in a love of Vishnu and who had a considerable knowledge of ancient Tamil literature and its variants of traditional stories concerning Vishnu and his associates, as well as the philosophical differences between Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism.

Madhurakavi Alvar was his first disciple. Swami Madhurakavi Alvar composed 11 pasurams in praise of his Acharya, Swami Nammalvar known as Kanninun Siruthambu, which are included among the Nalayira Divya Prabandham.

==Work==
He contributed four pieces of works to &quot;Divya Prabhandham&quot;. These works consisted of 1,296 poems, making him the most prolific contributor to the 4,000 hymns written by the Alvar poet-saints. These works are:

*&quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot; (1102 verses)
*&quot;Tiruviruttam&quot; (100 verses)
*&quot;Tiruvaciriyam&quot; (7 verses)
*&quot;Periya Tiruvantati&quot; (87 verses)

&quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot; describes Ranganatha as a metaphor for discussing the philosophical details in

In the Sri Vaishnava canon, these four represent (in Tamil language) the four Sanskrit vedas, respectively, the Sama Veda, Rig Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. According to tradition &quot;He poured the cream of these vedas&quot; into his songs and poetry that were the result of deep mystic experience. Though Nammalvar did not visit any of the 108 divyadesam temples talked about in the Vaishnava religion, it appears from his works he must have had the vision of all the archa forms in the temples he glorified in his hymns.

==Style of composition==
The distinction of Nammalvar with his contemporaries is above the devotional aspects in writing, the visualization and dramatic movement. He mentions Vishnu in various aspects frequently in all his verses. The poems of &quot;Tiruvirrutam&quot; are depicted fully between the lone context of the hero and heroine. Most of these are utterances of the hero, heroine, her friends to the heroine or her mother to the heroine. The heroine always perceives her hero, Vishnu everywhere around her. As per Varadachari, &quot;Tiruviruttam&quot; is &quot;an account of the pilgrimage of the soul to its transcendence over its ignorance, sleep and sloth in which it is caught up in the body&quot;. While medieval poetry is considered self-pity and repentance, his works always have a message of hope.

==Significance ==

Nammalvar is regarded as one of the top three Hindu mystics in India, with the other two being Manickavasagar and Kabir. Nammalvar is considered greatest among the twelve alvars and his contributions amount to 1352 among the 4000 stanzas in the &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandam&quot;.

The Garuda Sevai &quot;utsavam&quot; (festival) in the month of Vaikasi (May-Jun) witnesses nine Garudasevai, an event in which festival image deities from the nava tirupathis temples namely, Mayakoothar Temple, Makara Nedunkuzhai Kannan Temple, Rettai Tirupathi - South Temple, Rettai Tirupathi North Temple, Vaithamanidhi Perumal Temple, Adhinaatha Perumal Temple - Thirukkurugur, Kaaisinavendhan Temple, Vijayaasana Perumal Temple, Sri Vaikuntanatha (Kallapiran) Temple are brought on Garuda vahana. The festival image of Nammalvar is also brought in &quot;Anna Vahanam&quot; (palanquin) and his verses dedicated to each of these nine temples are recited. The &quot;utsavar&quot; of deities of each of the nine temples, travel through the paddy fields in the area, reach Alvar Thirunagari. The verses dedicated to each of the nine Divyadesams are chanted with music and dance in front of respective utsavar deities. It is the most important of the festivals in this area, and it draws thousands of visitors.After this paasuram recital is completed, the Alvar utsavar in anna vahanam and the nine Perumal deities in Garuda Vahanam come around the maada veethi [temple street] of Alvar Thirunagari. Then, each divyadesam Perumal utsavar bid farewell to their most relished jeevathma Nammalvar and return to their respective temples. Amongst these Perumals, when Alvar most favourite deities of Irattai tirupathi leave after the utsavam, Alvar is saddened by their departure and will wait until they take a turn to their divyadesams. This episode of the Garuda Sevai is known as &quot;Vidaiyaatri Utsavam&quot;. The saddened Alvar is taken into the temple by Alvar Thirunagari&#x27;s deity Polindhu Nindra Piran by showing his beauty. This garuda sevai is to show how Alvar has sung paasurams on each perumal without moving an inch from his Thirupuliyazhwar. All the Perumals come to the Holy Tamarind tree to get sung by the Alvar.

The &quot;Pagal Pathu&quot; and &quot;Ra Pathu&quot; festivals are celebrated in the month of &quot;Margazhi&quot; (December–January) for twenty days in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam. The first ten days are referred to as &quot;Pagal-Pathu&quot; (10-day daytime festival) and the second half as &quot;Ra Pathu&quot;(10-day nighttime festival). The first day of &quot;Ra pathu&quot; is &quot;Vaikunta Ekadashi&quot;. The eleventh day of each fortnight in the Tamil calendar is called &quot;Ekadasi&quot; and the holiest of all &quot;Ekadasi&quot; in the Vaishnava tradition is the &quot;Vaikunta Ekadashi&quot;. Nammalvar, one of the 12 &quot;alvars&quot;, is believed to have ascended to &quot;Vaikuntha&quot; (the heavenly abode of Vishnu) on this day. The devotion of the 9th-century poet, Nammalvar, and his perceived ascent to heaven are enacted annually. During the festival, through song and dance, this place is affirmed to be &quot;Bhoologa Vaikunta&quot; (heaven on earth). &quot;Araiyar Sevai&quot; is a divine colloquium of &quot;araiyars&quot;, who recite and enact Nalayara Divya Prabanda, the 4000 verses of &quot;alvars&quot; (Vaishnavite poets of the 7th–10th century). &quot;Araiyars&quot; are born to the &quot;Araiyar&quot; tradition most prevalent in Sri Vaishnava families in Srirangam, Alvar Thirunagari and Srivilliputhur. The tradition of &quot;Araiyar Sevai&quot; was started by Nathamuni, a 10th-century Vaishnavite who compiled the works of &quot;alvars&quot;. It is believed as per Hindu mythology that 330 million demi-gods came down to witness the event. The festival deity is brought to the 1,000-pillared hall on the morning of &quot;Vaikunta Ekadashi&quot; through the &quot;Paramapada Vasal&quot; (gate to paradise). Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims rush to enter it after the gate is opened and the deity passes through it as it is believed that one who enters here will reach &quot;Vaikuntha&quot; (heaven) after death. The gate is open only during the ten days of &quot;Ra Pathu&quot; (10 days of the nighttime festival). On the last day of the festival, the poet Nammalvar is said to be given salvation. The performance is enacted by priests and images in the temple depicts Nammalvar as reaching heaven and getting liberation from the cycle of life and death. At that point, a member from the crowd of devotees, who are witnessing this passion play, goes up to the centre stage and requests Vishnu to return Nammalvar to humanity, so that his words and form in the temple will continue to inspire and save the devotees. Following this performance of the salvation of Nammalvar, the cantors are taken in procession around the temple.

<text>Philip McNeely is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the riding of Ottawa—Orléans for the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Background==
McNeely was born in Cumberland, Ontario and is bilingual. He was educated at Lisgar Collegiate and McGill University, earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the latter. He later earned the equivalent of a Master&#x27;s Degree in engineering from the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London. Before entering politics, he was the CEO of &quot;McNeely Engineering&quot;, a firm which operated in the Ottawa region. He sold this firm in 1997, claiming it had suffered under provincial cutbacks to infrastructure spending.

==Municipal politics==
In 2000, McNeely was elected as a municipal councillor for the Cumberland Ward of the amalgamated City of Ottawa, defeating incumbent Robert van den Ham. In 2002, he played a key role in the successful &quot;Hay West&quot; project, in which hay from eastern Canada was shipped to the drought-stricken west. He was also active in opposing the creation of a hog farm in the village of Sarsfield part of the Cumberland Ward of Ottawa.

==Provincial politics==
In the provincial election of 2003, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Brian Coburn in Ottawa—Orleans by about 4500 votes. He was named a government whip on October 23, 2003.

In July 2006, McNeely described Israel as a &quot;rogue state&quot;, arguing that Israel&#x27;s military campaign in Lebanon was resulting in collective punishment for the Lebanese people. Dalton McGuinty expressed &quot;serious dismay and disappointment&quot; for these remarks, and McNeely later offered an apology for the language of his comments.

He was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 2007, beating Conservative candidate Graham Fox by almost 9,000 votes. In the 2011 election he was re-elected with a margin of 2,854 votes.

In 2005, McNeely proposed an amendment to a no smoking bill that would ban power wall cigarette advertising from convenience stores and retail businesses. The &quot;McNeely Amendment&quot;, which came into effect on May 31, 2008, has helped keep cigarettes out of the sight of children.

During his time in office, McNeely has served as Parliamentary Assistant to a number of ministers including Minister of Transportation, Minister of Health and Long Term Care and most recently as PA to the Minister of the Environment.

In 2014, McNeely announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2014 contest.

<doc id="1159879" wikidata="Q1862950" url="?curid=1159879" title="Kinnaur district">
<text>Kinnaur district is a mountainous district located in the northeast part of the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. Kinnaur district borders Tibet (China) to the east, the state of Uttarakhand to the south, Shimla district to the southwest, Kullu district to the west, and Lahaul and Spiti district to the north. The administrative headquarters of the district is at Reckong Peo. 

==History==
Over the 10th-11th centuries A.D., Kinnaur was a part of the Guge kingdom. The Guge kingdom broke apart in the 12th century, and the Bushahr state arose in the Western Himalayas, taking over most parts of present-day Kinnaur. The Bushahr state originated in the Kamru village of Sangla valley. However, the uppermost part of Kinnaur remained under Tibetan influence until the late 17th century, when it was handed over to the Bushahr state by the Tibetans as a reward for assistance in the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal War. The Bushahr state shifted its capital to Sarahan, and later still to Rampur, which caused this state to be known eventually as &#x27;Rampur-Bushahr&#x27;. Rampur-Bushahr was attacked by the Gurkhas in the early 19th century. Soon afterwards, the British gained supremacy in the region. Rampur-Bushahr became a princely state owing suzerainty to the British crown, until India&#x27;s Independence in 1947. Most of present-day Kinnaur district was known as &#x27;Chini tehsil&#x27; under the Rampur-Bushahr state. On 15 April, 1948, Rampur-Bushahr became a part of the Republic of India, and a part of an administrative unit called the Mahasu district. In 1960, the Chini tehsil and fourteen villages of the neighbouring Rampur tehsil were separated from the Mahasu district to create the new district of Kinnaur.

== Geography ==
Kinnaur is an entirely mountainous district. The general altitude range is 1,500 metres above sea level to over 6,000 metres above sea level. The district is drained by several tributaries of the Sutlej river. Three mountain ranges run through or touch Kinnaur: the Zanskar range, the Great Himalaya range, and the Dhauladhar range. The highest peak of Kinnaur district, Leo Purgyil (6,816m), is also the highest peak of Himachal Pradesh state. The Kinner Kailash peak (6,050m), a regional pilgrimage site for Hindus, is also located in Kinnaur. 

Administratively, Kinnaur is the third largest district by size in Himachal Pradesh, with an area of 6,401 sq. km. The district has five tehsils (Nichar, Kapla, Sangla, Pooh, and Moorang) and one sub-tehsil (Hangrang). For development purposes, the district is divided into three developmental blocks - Nichar, Kalpa, and Pooh.

==Climate==
Most of Kinnaur has a temperate climate, due to its high elevation. Winters last from October to May, while summers last from June to September. The upper areas of the Sutlej valley and an adjoining lower part of the Spiti valley (which also falls under the Kinnaur district) lie in the rain shadow area, with an arid climate similar to Tibet. In this region, winters are long and harsh, with snowfall, while summers are mild. The lower parts of the Sutlej valley and the Baspa valley receive monsoon rains over July to September. The rains vary from moderate to heavy, making some areas prone to landslides. 

==Flora and fauna==
Portions of Kinnaur are situated high in the Himalaya, where vegetation is sparse and consists primarily of hardy grasses. Alpine species such as juniper, pine, fir, cypress, and rhododendron can be found at elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 metres, primarily in Middle Kinnaur. At lower altitudes, temperate-climate trees are found, including oak, chestnut, maple, birch, alder, magnolia, apple, and apricot.

Kinnaur district has two protected areas: 

=== Rupi Bhaba Wildlife Sanctuary ===
This sanctuary, established in 1982, covers 503 sq.km. The flora includes kharsu, oak, weeping fig, alpine, chir pine, Himalayan temperate forest, coniferous and dry broad leaved coniferous. The fauna includes the Western Tragopan, the cheer pheasant, the snow leopard, the brown bear, the Himalayan tahr, the blue sheep, and musk deer.

=== Lippa-Asarang Wildlife Sanctuary ===
This sanctuary, established in 1974, covers 30.90 sq.km. Much of this sanctuary is a cold desert. Key fauna found there include the wild yak, Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, brown bear, musk dear, goral, blue sheep, and ibex. 

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, Kinnaur district has a population of 84,121. This gives it a ranking of 620th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 7.61%. Kinnaur has a sex ratio of 819 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 80%. The entire population was rural. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 17.53% and 57.95% of the population respectively.

==Languages==
Kannaura people speak about nine language varieties, eight from Sino-Tibetan language family; Kinnauri, Chitkuli, Sumcho, Jangrami, Poo Kinnauri, Wangpo Kinnauri, Sunam, Nesang and one from an Indo-Aryan language family, called Pahari Kinnauri. Also see At the 2011 census, 72% of the population in the district spoke or knew native languages of Kinnaur, 16.65% Hindi and 7.03% Nepali as their first language. Although, Hindi is fast emerging as the language of choice in most domains, especially the young speakers, due to the demands of modernity which has threatened the native languages.
